GoIA is the same game as GoIO + PVE. If you own PVP you can upgrade it to PVE for less. If you dont own it, you pay for PVP and PVE. Its one multiplayer game with CO-OP and PVP			"

Worth the time and monies.So the way to log hours for this at the current status is a little wonky, since it runs off the base game. However I gotta say that after a bit of time playing, making a few friends, talking to a couple of devs on the ingame chat... It's a really nice game! For the price you get a fair bit out of it, especially for new players the majority of the community is welcoming and willing to help.Every game I've played has been enjoyable one way or another, sure some frustrations with players but that's to be expected and I can't blame the game or development for this, it comes down to communication, positivity and trying to be the best you can be while having a good bout of fun. Nobody should expect AAA quality in every spot but then again; plenty of ""AAA"" games really haven't been living up to that.Definitely recommend to friends if you have fun playing it, help the game, get the player base up because it definitely deserves some good recognition!

				38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful			","									With ~700 hours or ~1000 matches on old GOI, and an alpha/beta tester for Alliance, I can recommend Alliance if you desire two of  the three below:+Teamwork-focused play+Airships+Stratigic planning and execution.I'll go into each in more detail below, but that's the TL;DR. If you check off two boxes above: get the game! TeamworkWith the basic ship requiring four crewmembers to run, Guns of Icarus rewards the crew as a whole, not the individuals among them. For example, you can be the best gunner in the world, but if the pilot can't get the guns to bear on the target, you'll have a harder time. The same goes with piloting. You may be a great pilot, but if the engineer neglects the engines your ship will quickly be dead in the water. The same goes for engineering, you may keep the components up under pressure, but if the gunner fails to take out the enemy ship's guns or the pilot puts your ship in a 2v1, well, there is only so much a single engineer can do!  At first, that may sound like a circle of blame, but the end-result is quite the opposite. Players are not selfish because selfishness and solo-carrying are not in the equation to begin with. The net result is a great feeling of comradery and a friendly, welcoming community. AirshipsThe airships feel amazing to fly and crew aboard. Skimming over dunes, weaving through broken cities, and deviously setting traps in canyons. If you like the feeling of sailing, and you like the feeling of sailing IN THE SKY, then this game NAILS that feeling.  With alliance, you no longer have to conted with any PvP anxiety, just climb aboard with your friends and have a blast sinking enemy ships. There's nothing better than sinking the map's giant boss ship in one last zooming pass! Planning and ExecutionThere are many options when it comes to ships, guns, loadouts, maps, and skills. The net result is a lot of interconnected parts that are rewarding to figure out. Want to try sitting back and sniping with your ship? Put on some long-range cannons and rockets! Want to get in close? Swap them out with a gatling gun and a flamethrower. Every ship has multipule strategies and ways of attacking depending on the ship's and crew's loadout and map. Alliance doubles-down on this. It's quite rewarding figuring out how to speed-run an attack mission, or hold the defensive line with just a single ship. The strategies and weapons for PvE can differ from PvP, making the game more interesting to learn and plan for all a level's intricasies.  I hope this review helps you in your decision to purchase Guns of Icarus Alliance.			"

				21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful			","									While I really enjoyed the premise of Guns of Icarus Online, I am not a fan of purely PvP scenarios. I played it for a few matches back in 2014, but I quickly got tired of getting plowed over by players with hundreds of hours of playtime and every ships' capabilities and ideal loadouts memorized. I know, get good, but PvP usually isn't my thing in any game - I lack competitive drive in video games, I guess. Life is competition; I am here to relax, eh?What I liked most about Guns of Icarus Online was the community. While I wasn't good enough to keep up in most cases, everyone was friendly. Mods and even the devs played sometimes. Second to that was the tightly built gameplay emphasizing teamwork and communication. So enters Alliance a few years later. And boy, does Alliance provide the gameplay and community I enjoyed, and then some. Only now, instead of feeling like I am dragging my team down with every missed shot or poor choice in repair orders, I can play in a lower-pressure environment where even just being a dedicated Engineer is a valuable contribution. Even if all I do is put out fires and buff my components with a magic crowbar that spits armor points, I am helping. And when the ship goes down, nay, should she go down, no one is upset. It isn't a big deal - spawn back in and try again.At the start of each match you pick one of three classes: Gunner, Engineer, or Captain. There are a few different tools for each class to pick. Pilots can choose from things like Kerosene to boost the speed of the engines, or a spyglass to look for enemies. Gunners get a variety of ammo choices such as incendiary or charged, and Engineers get several tools with which to bang away at the components and pray (also called repairing). Every class gets to take one of each of the other two's tools, so even as a Gunner you can put out fires with an Engineer's fire extinguisher, and as a Engineer you can use your favorite ammunition. Further, there are tons of customization options should playing dress-up with your avatar be interesting to you.The ships all seem well designed, with each offering different styles of operation. Some are shoot-and-scoot harassers, some are slow, lumbering behemoths capable of pouring fire in nearly every direction. On top of that, each captain chooses their own weapon loadout - offering significant variety for everyone onboard. The Pyramidion, for example, has two forward facing mounts and two on the left side - but none on the right or towards the rear. So it makes for a great chaser, and can in some case bring three weapons to bear on a single target, but it has no offerings should it be flanked on the right. Then there's the Galleon, with mounts underneath the main deck, two left and two right - but none to the front - making her a dedicated broadside machine.There are several mission types available, from defending your base to attacking the enemies', infiltrating points, escorting a VIP, and so on. I have played them all and while I enjoy the Assault mode the best so far, they are all fun and offer regularly tense battles. And that is from a newbie who stays on normal or hard... There is a solo play mode, where your ship is crewed by AI, but I found that to be immediately dry - it removes the teamwork aspect from a game that sells itself based on the appeal of teamwork. The Faction system adds depth to what might have been a little more dull to some by giving a purpose to all those AI you are shooting out of the sky. Every match, whether a loss or a victory, contributes points towards attacking or defending a territory of your choice. Do you want to work with your faction and all target the same spot for quick points building while leaving everything else hanging? Spread the points out to help reinforce what you can? Up to you, but all your battles have meaning on a grander scale. Every territory offers precious resources and should be considered tactically: what will result in a your faction being spread too thin? What gives you a good defensive line?By the way, join the Mercantile Guild. Or watch as we burn your faction's lands down around you - your call. :) I haven't had any bugs or issues so far, but it is worth noting that the game locks itself to 60FPS with or without v-sync on, so if you rock a 144hz monitor or similar this won't take advantage of that. It requires an Internet connection to play at all. It has a few performance issues when things get truly going, but never drops below 30FPS on an i7 4790K, 32GB of DDR3 RAM, and a GTX1080. It is running off an SSD. All this is small fries to me, but may be important to some. Also, I understand some people are unhappy that it costs extra but even I knew that they were always planning to charge extra for the (in 2014) then-titled ""Adventure"" mode, and I wasn't a big follower of the games. I don't mind though, people seem to forget that the developers need to pay their bills too. And I don't think the asking price is anything more than fair. But I wasn't a Kickstarter backer or anything - so I can't speak for those people.I wholly recommend this if you enjoy the idea of manning the last functional gatling gun on your ship, desperately trying to nail the jerk who's lit your ballon and hull on fire while your captain yells for the engineers to repair what they are already frantically beating at with hammers and tries to juke out of their turret's angle of fire - only to hit a mountain at full speed and explode the ship while the Engineers sing that awful Celine Dion song from the Titanic. You know the one.Overall, I bought 3 copies of this after playing it for a few hours, so that my wife and brother could join me in the co-operative goodness. And it was worth it. Fantastic title. This was supposed to be short little review, but if you actually read all this tripe I'll email you a cookie or something. Man, I can ramble. "

				219 of 372 people (59%) found this review helpful4 people found this review funny			","									Initially upon launch, this game (appID 608800) literally just downloaded and launched the old Guns of Icarus: Online (appID 209080), and enabled a DLC. Although it now runs under the correct appID, I am not sure why it is sold as an entirely new game, when it clearly is not. All of the exact same content is available under 608800 or 209080 as long as this DLC is enabled.That being said, this game is supposedly the delivery of a Muse's second KickStarter campaign for Guns of Icarus from 2013 that raised over $200,000. The campaign was for a *DLC* add-on called ""Adventure Mode"". The full add-on was supposed to be completed by June 2014. The core features of ""Adventure Mode"" as stated by Muse in the opening description paragraph of their Kickstarter:""A persistent online post-apocalyptic steam & dieselpunk world Crew or captain your own ship and experience airship combat taken to new levels Explore towns and take on missions to help them develop and grow...or bring them to ruin Politics and intrigue with six player-run factions, each vying to stake its claim in the world Robust and accessible economic and political systems that drive the action""In reality, the only thing that is fully delivered here is the second item, which is just a vague description of their original game, and not a unique aspect of this add-on. The fact that 2 of the 6 factions aren't done after this extremely extended development cycle is concerning, to say the least. The core premise of the fundraiser was clearly not realized.There were also stretch goal features that were not met (walk-able towns, etc.) but the developers repeatedly promised that they would secure additional funding to support the stretch features if the core game was funded, releasing the entire project as several ""smaller DLC"".[i.imgur.com] They very quickly back-pedaled on that stance upon securing the core funding. However, two stretch goals WERE met, ""More game modes"" and ""More boss ships"", with no clear representation in this 'finished' product. Again, the core premise of the fundraiser, and the stretch goals reached, were clearly not realized.I have a hard time believing this is all just a misunderstanding, as this is not the first time they have over-promised and under-delivered on a KickStarter campaign for Guns of Icarus. They initially funded GoIO with a KickStarter in 2011 that promised features that still haven't been implemented. Things like ""Extensive customization with lots of weapons, engines, and decorative ship parts"" or ""Campaign with mission, factions, trade, and crafting - dynamically affecting battlefronts and alliances"" still aren't in the game. As far back as 2012 if not earlier, there were stats for crafting commodities, alternate ship components, trade items, and even *goats*[i.imgur.com] buried in the game code, but never actually implemented in game. I believe they are still part of the game code, just completely abandoned.I understand developing a game is hard and projects change, but is having two KickStarter campaigns for the exact same game premise, and then having *both* dramatically under-deliver normal? I really hope not.Purchase at your own discretion. I've already received a full refund.(Day late + dollar short)^2 = GoI:Alliance			"

Alliance has a very special place in my heart. It all began one morning in September of 2015, I was asked if I wanted to help out in testing Alliance, I was instantly hooked from that day and have not stopped loving it ever since. I have seen many features, many sounds and many people through testing the game. I developed one of the largest clans in the Dev App filled with Open and Closed - Alpha and Beta testers. I've tested the original Arashi Faction AI's and I have developed an unhealthy relationship with the new games soundtrack... I've spent many hours pestering Boss Ships with squids just to listen to the Boss Theme.If you're a fan of the original Guns of Icarus Online or want something more Co-Op based as opposed to skill, I demand you check out this wonderful installment into the Guns of Icarus Universe on all Media Platforms! To rate my love for this game in numbers or feelings would be biased. I have showcased the game at 3 conventions and I have become close friends with most of the development team. All I can say is go with your heart and enjoy this game for what its experiences can offer!See you in the skies, The Mann - At your service.			"

It comes with 4 game modes over 8 maps. 4 PvE factions (with 2 more comming soon) each with their own exclusive titles, outfits, hats, exlusive ship (1 per faction), exlusive light gun (1 per faction) and heavy guns comming soon (1 per faction).Modes are: Defend the baseSearch & Destroy (you have to survive 5 waves, without loosing 5 ships - for whole team)Infiltration (you have to escort 1 player ship, VIP, without that ship dying once)Recovery ( you have to recover stolen cargo from enemy, before they destroy your refineries that are on their escape route)Enemy waves are generated by the AI director - whose task is to give you just enough challenge (limited by the dificults selected - dificulty indreases enemy health and enemy dps).Ammongst the enemies in PvE you have in adittion to NPC shis also aeroplanes and huge boss ships (these have 3 stages, and you have to aim ath the glowing red weak spot).New ships and new light guns are locked behing faction progression (you can freely switch factions, but in beta there was a penalty in your standing in yuor previous faction -  I haven't tried to switch since full release).PvP weapons work better than the PvE exclusive weapons in my personal experience (it could also be much better familiarity): PvE exclusive ships while very ornamented, they are lot harder to learn due to unusual weapon placements, but feel as effective as PvP ships.Alliance also comes with with a meta game where factions are trying to conquer as much taritory as possible (each faction has it's own set of resource goals it wants). With each match you earn resources and progress in the land you are deployed in - for your faction (both in PvP and in PvE). You can spend those resources for extra progress of your faction or delay enemy faction. Top 10 contributing players in their faction become faction leaders - allowing them to change faction meassage, wherever they deploy each player from same faction deployed in the same zone gets extra faction progress (that motivates other players from same faction to attack or defend same zone as their faction leader - thus indirectly directing how their faction wages war). Faction progression is important becouse it helps faction progress and helps you unlock faction speciffic rewards.			"

A lot of the issues that drove me away from pvp: stacked lobbies, 30+ minute wait times; I've experienced none of these issues with this new PvE expansion.The gameplay is awesome.  fighting hordes of airships and planes is exhilerating and exactly what i was looking for with this expansion.  there are four difficulties that are curved wonderfully.ignoring their actual names, they come down to:""for new players"" gameplay""casual"" gameplay""challenging"" gameplay""I have 500+ hours in this game"" gameplayit works well, and finally having a server browser in this game has improved the overall experience dramatically.  They've made very good UI improvements, in particular to the menus.  I used to find them frustrating, now they are very workable.The faction system is kind of ""meh"" at the moment.  And sadly I think it's because launch didnt go so well.  I was not expecting to see sub 1000 players when this released, and the factions are OBVIOUSLY designed for a larger playerbase.  However, my real complaint with the system is it feels like it's just there to be there.  When you first join up, it looks pretty cool.  you have a world map with the faction colors marking territories.  these territories can be captured by faction members contibuting to the war effort in the form of points.  there is even a way to disrupt the opposition by making walls to increase the war effort requirement from the opposing side.It loses it's luster quick simply because there is no good way to communicate with faction members.  people just contribute their effort wherever they feel like, and it's a real shame theres no way to coordinate.  Now, there is a faction page which sits empty atm, and i'm hoping in 2 days when leaders are chosen, that this will change for the better.  i intend to update this review when that happens.Regardless, factions aren't all that important right now.  that's all it ammounts to.  but the gameplay is good, and they've made improvements to the game overall.

I'd had great fun in the last installment of Guns of Icarus, but I wasn't sure if Muse was just looking to make some kind of cosmetic, irrelevant addon to their game. Over the last few hours this worry has been dispelled. There was a time where I had genuine fun with Guns of Icarus, and Alliance has put me back in the saddle, and I'm definitely glad to have started playing again.The appeal of Guns of Icarus, to me, has always been working together with a team, to struggle and get better. Finally, the developers have actually enabled a system to where my contribution means something in a tangible, readily viewable way, and I feel like I'm having an actual impact on the system. Muse doesn't really bother with any flowery lore, and I'm glad they don't. They give me exactly what I wanted. A solid gameplay experience, that I can get better at the game with friends, and meet new team members along the way. That's really all that I wanted and they delivered it well.As well, this one of the first times I've seen an indie game has active multiplayer again. I haven't had a single issue finding a full lobby, and the new players have been genuinely eager to learn from more experienced players. It's pretty rare that I actually get to see that, and I'm surprised that Muse was able to actively foster that. But I suppose PvE is definitely a stronger enviorment for people to learn than PvP. As well, Muse hasn't slacked off on offering a challenge-seeking experience for more veteran players, with harder gamemodes. And it's actually been a challenge on the upper difficulty levels.As for the obvious question of cosmetics, Muse has done a great job of thematically designing new cosmetics based around the faction you're playing. If you like the aesthetic of a faction, you can fight for it and recieve gear related to it. But they don't lock you down either. One you pick a faction, you can switch any time if you wish to attempt to get gear from another faction. It's a nice touch, and adds a bit of longevity to the game.All in all, for the price tag, I would definitely look in to purchasing this. Muse has actually put some love into making this, and I've had an incredibly enjoyable experience so far. If you enjoyed the standard Guns of Icarus Online as much as I did, this is worth the price tag.			"

				8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful			","									Guns of Icarus Online is an outstanding game based on teamwork and personal skill that pits teams against one another on   dieselpunk airships outfitted for WAR. If that description doesn't have you amped, we can't be friends. It's garnered an impressively tight knit community that not only polices itself, it contributes directly to the lore and flesh of the game's universe. Alliance mode is the long awaited cooperative expansion to GoIO, and it's something that is simply amazing for several reasons: One of which being that Guns of Icarus Online used to have a very robust competitive scene, one that featured prominent and even incendiary figures that were both loved and hated by many in the community. These teams fought every week under extreme tension for the title of COGS Grand Champion,  but almost all of them started out as friends -- getting to know these people, then getting to fight against these people, has been an incredible experience.Now, Muse Games has done what very few developers do: They've listened to the community and produced an extension of their world so that we can team back up with our old friends and fight -together- instead of against one another, while still maintaining some semblance of competition in the form of a massive Territory War (think Soul Calibur 2). Ducks, Gentlemen, Merry Men and Cake alike can team up to form a fleet. This is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, guys.For those who are new to the community: Get in here. There's a bit of a learning curve, but we've always been open to teaching and strengthening the community as a result, and Muse Games is one of the friendliest developers you will ever meet. People have been mean, nasty and even downright hateful to them at times and still found a welcome place in the community -- many people have been turned from toxic players to ardent supporters in this way. Alliance is an amazing addition to Guns of Icarus Online, and it truly completes the Guns of Icarus experience.			"

Over the last few years Guns of Icarus has attracted a really diverse and amazing player base that is made up of multiple genders that are represented in every lobby and even in the Dev Team itself.Devs like Keyvias, Ayetach, and Josie have made it their legacy to make sure every issue and report is resolved quickly and discretely.No matter what gender you are, don't let the voice-chat scare you from this chance to join this amazing community, and this fantastic game.You are going to make a lot of friends!That's not a promise, that's a threat!

Becouse of the new mode.This game is airship combat. It is very heavy on teamwork, it i amazing what you can do with a crew that works toghter.There are two game modes, pvp that i have been playing for ages, and i still love it.Then there is the new alliance mode that is pve.In alliance mode you have factions and fight for territory, and resources.Witch Empire will be the last one standing?The thing is still the same in pvp or pve teamwork. You work for the common goal.Just different enemies, and it is fun, it can be chaotic, crazy and hilarious at the same time.The communicty is full of of fun people, the lobby of icarus can be fun and stupid sometimes.So join a faction and have some teamwork and have some fun.Go bang stuff if your the enginner.Hit on things if you're the gunner.Scream orders around if your the Captain.Dont run around like a crazy hamster on the boat.The devs are playing the game and interacting with the community.The community have tournaments and other competitions in the game.So do i still like the game?Yes i spend alot of time playing with friends and laughing and talking.I spend alot of time helping new people to get the teamwork going and teaching them.I will yeall at yuo but you are going to have fun and going to come back for more.I mean the game is much more fun with a microphone :)So my honest opinion the game mechanics works.The players are mostly friendly and fun.The community overall is very good, and that is why the game is still around and expanding.This is the game you can hop in for a game and then leave or play for houers.I know i spent far to much time in this game :)And im still going to spend more time in it.The conclusion is i have +450 games in my library and this is one of the top 5 games i spent most time in.I have meet people that after several hundreds of houers are more than friends, from all over the world.So the devs created more than a game, they created a game that demmands teamwork, and that creates friends.Thats the reason why i keep comming back to the game.

At the start, you select a faction, and the map displays its conquest. 'Deploying' in a certain location will make the results of your gameplay go towards its conquest. Fun, a little repetitive, not as hectic as PVP, but still tactical.8.5/10Content:Alliance adds several new ships and weapons unique to each faction. It keeps many similarities from main game, and all of its ships and weapons. What Alliance lacks is enemy variety. There are currently a couple ship types, plane squadrons, stationary cannons, and boss ships. I would like to see a little more variety.7.5/10Player base:Small, but helpful.

				8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful			","									Alliance is the culmination of a successful kickstarter campaign and a long time desire within the GOIO community for PVE content. While it is a shame it came so late in the dev cycle, to have been with this game and dev since launch till now...you gotta give them props for pulling off something this big for a studio their size. There are generally two types of players in GOIO...those who love this game to death and become iconic within it's community, and those who come from straight of FPS games and are expecting CoD with airships. If you are a CoD with airship player, you can just go away now.GOIO has been, and remains to be the most unique and also probably the best PVP/PVE COOP title in the sense of, you either rise or fall based on your ability to work together. If you can't work with others well, this isn't the game for you. As a veteran player with well over 1000hrs in this game, it is often hard to find a reason to start it up because of bad players. Yet, if you get into the community, join a clan, find good crews, it makes up for all of that. There is an incredibly deep game for those that really try to master it.Alliance, like it or not, is a needed addition to GOIO. PVP may get the attention in the gaming leagues and global events, but PVE is where the majority of the playerbase generally is. That is a fact that has been published in the gaming industry. Blizzard has admitted this on numerous occassions.To achieve a decent PVE title in the midst of a PVP airship combat game, Muse took a page from a classic game mode that has been included in a few titles. Soul Caliber 2 Arcade being the oldest one in my memory. In that it had a conquest mode where players could join factions and conquer the world. The modern day version of this is seen in For Honor.If this concept interests you, then you'll find enjoyment here. The maps are decent enough but unfortunately, there isn't as many unique ones as you'll probably want. Which is similar to For Honor. However, there is an AI director in charge of the maps which will change up spawns and when certain enemies attack so it isn't as predictable as For Honor. You could sometimes get a boss ship at the last part of a mission, or sometimes at the start. Things like that. The UI...well it's vastly improved from the old days, however, it can be quite complex for new players. Best take it slow. Look around the edges of the screen for options and other key settings. Also ask in global chat. Most of the time other players are generally helpful and there are CA players around that assist at all hours.The new ships are a mix of fun and quirky. The new guns become almost must haves in some cases. And the special abilities for characters really can turn a certain defeat into a come from behind win.Ultimately the experience you have in Alliance will be dependent on your teammates, if you choose to fly with others. It's the same as the PVP mode. However in Alliance you can choose to just go solo. You won't see all the maps or gametypes in solo mode, but you can avoid people if you don't like the crowd you're attracting. Something you couldn't do with the original PVP GOIO.So take it from someone who has been in this game a long time. If you like raiding in MMOs where you have to work together with others, GOIO in either mode is for you. If you are a solo FPS player who has a short attention span, neither game is for you. There is a learning curve that looks harder than it actually is. But for those who master it, this game becomes amazing.			"

												tl:dr:meh.I regret humoring the idea of giving it a go again.Lovely.There are so many things wrong with that I am at loss where to start precisely.Let me start with core then - the gameplay.In a nutshell it is as follows:Pick a faction, pick a location to deploy, play a match PVP or PVE thus contributing around 100 points towards needed 25000, spend accumulated currency towards the needed points, repeat until you unlock one out of 4 new ships. Or was it guns? Whichever - you got the idea.Maps are few and those are extremelly boring, bland and look nothing like the original game. The jungle one looks so bright and green that it belongs in Far Cry 3.Basicly, that is about it. A handful of new stuff, suprisingly stupid AI, and idle farmer in one.You do not really get a new game and it just barely hits the amount of content to be called DLC but, for obvious marketing reasons, however, alliance is called a game.Dont be fooled by that ""generous"" free base-game. Alliance simply will fail to run without it, since alliance itself is nothing more than useless and grindy mechanic strap-on with few new ships.About matchmaking:Non-existant for pvp at the moment due to lack of players and servers, which can be explained with Alliance launch but at the same time tells a bit about playerbase status (spoiler alert: devs had many peaks over 2k and many opportunities to secure that playerbase, but how and why they ♥♥♥♥ that up over and over again I explained in another review).Useless in pve, where it assigns me to servers of different continent with whole two perfectly healthy EU servers running, as well as stuffing brand new players on board of my ship. Well, at least it is PVE - they can't mess up balance in PVE, right?... right??About new tutorial:Good job.Try again.Good job.Try again.Good job.Try again.Those two samples used repeatedly in succession for gunner's tutorial pretty much sum it up for you - cheap and useless.It does not teach ♥♥♥♥, rather it simply tells player to do X because tutorial said to do so.For additional annoyance there is also main menu tutorial, showing you where various buttons are - which should not be, for any reason, neccessary in a normally designed menu. Did not bother to read, having this thing forced on me at least four times since I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon GoI in 2015, but noted that those pop-up windows love to be barely visible and try to hide off-screen.Just to quickly wrap it up - a few extras, since I frankly dont care for a year already:Advertising in launcher.Outdated manual since 2015.Grindy or/and impossible achievements with a total count of 800.Beg players to write reviews @ Launch base game through alliance link, making it impossible to log time in alliance and, therefore, to write a review.Same incompetent developers as before.Thanks for a free key, chumps, after I shook down refund from you.

The work around is to open Guns of Icarus: Online, then alt-tab and open Guns of Icarus: Alliance. An error will pop-up. Keep the error open. I have 2000 hours in the PVP mode and probably about 10 in Alliance mode. That said:This is a game unlike any other I have played.  Muse games recently released Alliance in order to create a PVE play mode for their base game: Guns of Icarus: Online. Now, the two meld together to create an experience which caters to the tryhard competitive type, the casual players, and everyone in between.The amount of teamwork this game offers cannot be compared. You simply have to try it out. Ask questions if you have them – it is the friendliest community I have ever been associated with. The action is great, the downtime is slim, and the impact you have as an individual is huge. You are one player of a group of four responsible for keeping an airship running and gunning. You have the opportunity to partner up with other ships of the same crew size to take down the enemy. Captains of these ships must communicate, coordinate, and conquer the battlefield in order to secure victory.There is a grinding mechanic for those that like that type of thing – it is essentially a world map that uses Risk like behavior. It can be fun and immersive but it is not necessary if you just want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up.The developer to player communication is like none I have ever seen. I just recently talked to a developer LIVE while meandering about the user interface looking at different un-lockable items like costumes and achievements. Furthermore, they do a thing every Friday called a Fireside Chat on their twitch channel: https://www.twitch.tv/gunsoficarus they talk about the game and answer questions live. It’s a unique experience I have never had before. It feels kind of surreal. Overall, I like Alliance. I am a big fan of the PVP mode and this PVE mode is just as good. I’m glad they made this game and I’m glad I caught it on sale. I understand that my review may be biased. I like this game immensely as I have never played a game that matches the style this offers. I like flight simulators, I like teamwork based games, I like the idea of a leadership role, and I like tactical positioning. I am a huge advocate of PvP for this game on the competitive level. I feel no other game can compare to the amount of coordination it takes to win.Thanks for reading.  "

On top of an engaging and polished game I found the community to be warm, welcoming, and the best resource for game information around. During my first week of playing various captains and crews taught me all about my favored role, Engineer, and what weapons did what, what ammunition did what, and generally how to play the game without snark or contempt.Pick it up, encourage your friends to pick it up, make a crew and hit the skies. It's absolutely fantastic.			"

The thing I like most about Guns of Icarus is that you ""are"" not simply a flying battleship, but that you are a crew member who can move around and interact with the different parts of your vessel: to pilot it, shoot the different turrets, or grease the engines. And also do so as part of a bigger crew with whom you travel on the very same vessel: your team of friends.Now Alliance adds even more to the novel playing scheme. More ships, more weapons, more tools the player can carry around, more skills... and everything within an action packed, online RPG like game mode where you join a faction and fight to gain territories and resources for it. Also note that you and your crew can contribute to your faction either by battling other human crewed ships, or engage in massive assaults against AIs and bosses.Tons of possibilities and ways to personalize your ship. This game never gets boring. 100% recommended!!			"

												A rather fun game over all. More fun with more friends though. Playing the game solo with AI support gets a little tedious, but there is a good player base and the community is friendly!			"

The PvE mode is consistantly challanging, and the modes and maps are diverse enough that this feels like a new game. Alliance still has the same great post-apocalyptic steampunk aesthetic, the same rewarding need to communicate and coordinate, and the same friendly and patient community.			"

				5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful			","									There are so many things great with this game, and I don't think I could give it justice in a review (go buy it!), but I'll try!Been playing Guns of Icarus Online for a while when Alliance came out. Played the beta back in January, and playing again as it's out now. It's pretty awesome all-around. If you liked Guns of Icarus Online but maybe found it too easy or too tedious to find other people to compete with, then you'll love Alliance!Guns of Icarus Alliance pits you in a single team fighting against waves of enemies, with a boss at some point. It has great difficulty and great balance - they're not a pushover, but they're not impossible either. That is, unless you're mad and play on Hell difficulty, in which case, you're in hell.But you're not just fighting enemies for the sake of fighting enemies. You have to join a faction (You get to choose between the Anglean Republic, the Fjord Baronies, the Order of Chaladon or the Mercantile Guild), and, as you win more matches in Alliance, you give progress to some place or other - either attacking a new place or defending one of your contested territories. There are brand new ships, abilities, and weapons to choose from, but don't be fooled! You don't get to pick out the best setup on your first time in. You have to actually earn it, through sweat and tears (though that's mostly due to a broken AC unit), as you progress through more and more fights, you'll eventually be far enough to unlock your faction-specific ship (each faction has their own ship!), and so on and so forth.I just came out of a session with a bunch of friends, including one who I had to push into buying Alliance, as he didn't like the original game much. When we got off, he asked me how soon we could play again. It's that good.The Guns of Icarus Online game is really quality content, and Guns of Icarus Alliance is even more quality content to add on top. I barely ever rank games more than 7.5/10, and Guns of Icarus Alliance is a solid 9.5/10. Guns of Icarus Online is a strong 8/10 in comparison.""If perfection existed, it would look a whole lot like Guns of Icarus Alliance."" - Albert EinsteinGo buy it!			"

Great if you have three friends to run a ship with, and if not that's ok because the community is welcoming and friendly.  Just say ""I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING"" and they'll help you out and explain mechanics.			"

Muse has done a fantastic job at rounding out this game. Backed it years ago and thought it would never come. But they have so much content it's closer to another full game opposed to a DLC. Totally worth the money and wait. There are 4 factions currently active with 2 more to add. New ships, guns and outfits for all the factions. A new world map to fight over resources and territory! They took the standard GoIo and added a global strategy perspective to it and role playing can be stronger than ever with players and clans taking factions sides to face off. If you didn't like other players...no problem you can fight PvE all day long. 4 levels of difficulty with 5 different modes, 10 new maps, small planes, and boss ships to make you run literally for the hills. Not to mention tons of new achievments, titles and badges to earn. When you have been in the game for close to 4 years it's refreshing to have something new that can give you a challenge. #hugsformuse #GoIA			"

				13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful1 person found this review funny			","ention: ""Guns of Icarus Alliance"" is a re-release of the purely PvP multiplayer game ""Guns of Icarus Online"". While the description says it's a ""Co-Op/PvE experience"", it does in fact also include the original PvP mode. Don't ask me why they didn't simply make this a dlc for the original game. Muse tends to be clowny like that.Anyways, because of this, the first part of this review focuses on the PvP aspect of this game for anyone, who is not familiar with Guns of Icarus yet. As a long time player, I feel that potential buyers should know about this, because while it's suspiciously absent from this store page, it's still arguably the main part of the game!Regarding PvP (A copy-paste of my review for the original Guns of Icarus Online; Yes, it was exactly the same bloody game as this; Yes, I know that's kinda stupid)It's such a shame that so few people come around to try and learn to appreciate Guns of Icarus.I find it really hard to enjoy non-coop multiplayer games these days. It seems like competition and rankings is all they're about now. Getting in a matchmaker, being thrown out there against a couple of faceless opponents you're never gonna see again, have a minute or two to pick your champ/hero/loadout/whatever, go. No wonder communities go to ♥♥♥♥ if you don't even have a moment to think about the fact that those other players are actual human beings.But GoI? It's just different. And I couldn't even exactly tell people why, at least not without wasting a couple of paragraphs overanalyzing every single aspect of the game and my own personality. Somehow it manages to take away all the angst, salt and frustration that usually comes with multiplayer (well... most of the time). Instead of always competing in some sort of league where everyone is his own overzealous soccer mom, it feels more like a nice evening at a board game bar, playing with some friendly strangers, not so much against them.Guns of Icarus is something that very few multiplayer games can call themselves in my opinion. A thing I can only describe as ""comfy"". Something I haven't experienced like that since way back when I would spend my whole time playing WCIII fun maps with random people and I'm so glad to have found a game that could give me that again.If recent multiplayer experiences just don't really seem to do it for you anymore absolutely give this game a try! Maybe It's just what you need!Regarding PvEWell, there you have it. The PvP game that plays like a co-op experience now has an actual co-op mode. And just like many other ""veterans"" I'm somewhat torn in my opinion on it. On the one hand I naturally welcome all and any new content for one of my favourite games, but on the other hand it's not really something the dedicated players ever asked for, which is unsurprising, since we were evidently fine with the game as it was. Due to the new tools, special abilities and eventually ships and weapons, it plays significantly differently form the original base game. Especially newer players will probably have a hard time coping with the fact, that some of their favourite loadout options may not be available in PvP. My biggest fear is, that this will create a devide in the community, effectualy leaving both modes with fewer concurrent players than the base game had before.The whole faction and world-map meta game is pretty shallow and lead ad absurdum by the fact that everyone is gonna jump between factions all the time anyways, in order to farm unlocks and achievements. It may have been a neat idea at the time, but in the meantime I think For Honor has already proven, that it's little more than background noise.But hey, Guns of Icarus (at least in my opinion) was never a game that had to rely on giving you arbitrary rewards for every match. It remains to be seen, whether the co-op missions and the pseudo Risk that comes with it will be fun enough to see significant play after most players have ground out all their desired unlocks.My recommendation is to not buy this game solely for the PvE content. The heart and soul of Guns of Icarus will always be the super chill skirmish mode.			"

There is absolutely no single player content aside from floating around on an empty map so you can fix your own ship or shoot the guns at nothing in particular. I feel like I was lied to and am considering a refund.

				No ratings yet			","									Alliance is a fantastic expansion to Guns of Icarus Online, adding loads of PVE content and breathing new life into one of my favorite PC games of the last five years. It still offers the same nail-biting team based gameplay, but with greatly expanded variety including new game modes, ships, weapons, difficulty modes, and compelling new enemy types from tiny bomber planes to huge bosses. Alliance also adds a new world map with different territories for your faction to control and the whole thing just makes the GOI universe feel much more real. All things considered I really enjoy the new Alliance expansion for GOI and I highly suggest it to anyone who loves coop play and big team battles.			"
