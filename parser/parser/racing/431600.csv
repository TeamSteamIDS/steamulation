Early Access Review
								Short version:Buy it if you prefer road racing sims to the more casual driving/racing games. Otherwise it's probably not for you. Also, no ovals currently.Long version:GeneralI'm no native Engish speaker. Automobilista (AMS) is Early Acces, but currently there is no racing sim that could be called a final product. So be aware that AMS and all the similar games are constantly changed, sometimes even introducing new bugs. I'm playing the game for quite a while, way before it came to Steam. The game is made by a small team and it seems that it's more about passion, than big money. It's not about being flashy, stylish etc., but about actual regulated car racing. No offense for NFS players, but this is the other end of the spectrum. It is true that AMS is based on rFactor 1, but it is much more than that.ContentThe game is rather obscure in this regard, but I personally like their picks. It started as a Brazilian Stock Car (which is a real thing) game, so the older content is Brazilian V8s and mostly Brazilian tracks. Over time they ventured into some popular and some less so areas, but most of the cars are quite different from each other. Many current games offer street cars, hypercars, GT3 and touring cars. AMS has Brazilian stock cars (60s, 80s and current), open wheel (old and new), fwd, rallycross, super trucks, and some more. Content is by no means mainstream. I didn't play much open wheel, but generally the cars feel authentic. I don't have any racing experience, but I'm driving probably before most Steam users were born. So yea, the cars feel really different. You sure don't drive the same a Formula Extreme and a Formula Vee. Night racing is supported, but no rain. Dynamic rubbering is on a Todo I think.Force FeedbackI have a Thrustmaster T500 + TH8 H shifter, so your experience may vary, depending on the wheel you use. This may be the best part of the game. I have all the actual racing sims and my personal experience is that no current game feels near to AMS regarding FFB, especially the later builds. This may be subjective experience, but it seems that the bigger the publisher, the worse the FFB gets (kudos to Codies/Dirt Rally, which is a rare exception). If you have driving experience, in AMS you can actually feel what is happening with the car (Neils' magic). Some of the more popular titles (that I'm playing too) are laughable in this area.AIDon't expect human behavior (carnage in T1), but racing with this AI is probably the most you can get if you play no MP. In most current sims, AI is questionable and this one is I had the most human-like races with. Be honest, even in the better ones, the first two laps are miserable. Here you see cars passing each other, passing you. On the other side, I didn't see any human-like mistakes (which I only saw in R3E). I've also been ocassionally divebombed, but no crazy AI flying all over the road or all AI pulled on a string.SPThe usual stuff. Training, race weekends and less usual, championships. There is no GT/AC/pCars like career. Championships are premade seasons for a car type. It is generally the same as rFactor1, except that the devs sometimes mess with the files and the championships don't really work, which is one of my main gripes with the game. For example in the current build, there are wrong (old) track names in the files and some series have 0 scoring. So without basic IT skills, you're doomed to wait for the devs.MPI only play that other game if I want actual MP racing without carnage, so I can't comment on this.VisualsDespite recently upgraded, visuals are a weak point. If you don't care about heat haze and sunrays, you'll be fine. But an AMS screenshot is like a photo of England on a regular day. SoundI find it that sound can get really subjective. I'm fine with sound in most racing sims.ConclusionMore for people who appriciate the older racing sims (GTR2, GTL, GPL etc) than posting a screenshot of your purple Huayra.PS I avoided mentionning other racing games where possible to avoid fanboys which unfortunately are a big chunk of racing sims/games communities.

												In my view, AMS is built around a very sharp observation. Around the year 2016, if you want a full suite racing simulator, you won't find one. One title offers superior visuals, but lacks some basic features even after years of development (Assetto Corsa). Other is packed with all the simulation features you want, gives you the best physics out there, but because of a lack of content and the somewhat last gen feel graphics, feels incomplete (rFactor2). The third teases you with officially licenced series, mindblowing sounds and attractive visuals, but again, fails in the features department, not to talk about robbing you with the plethora of microtransactions (RaceRoom Racing).Simply put, AMS is the only complete package out there. Although many say it is based on rFactor 1 engine, if the car feels as good as it does in AMS, I don't care what is there under the hood. Besides the excellent physics and FFB, the visual side is also top-notch. I don't know what the magic there is, but it simply looks and feels great, better than rF2. I especially like the day-night transitions, which are seamless, and the night racing experience is probably the best you can get. If that's not enough, all the features you liked in the previous generation of sims (you remember, back in the time when there was this strange habit of publishing finished products) - finally, they are there. And a big plus is that the game offers complete series, and though I was initially full of doubts as to how interesting these series can be for me, the European simracer, it was a very positive disappointment concerning both the cars and the tracks. The range of vehicles is vast, and even me, who is not a rally guy at all, find myself driving the Lancer RX simply because it is so much fun to drive.I had many doubts, but AMS totally convinced me - it is possibly the best, but most certainly the most complete sim you will get. The only negative in my view, is the price tag, but for the same array of content you could easily spend 60-70 EUR in some other titles, so maybe that's fair enough.			"

												Hopefully this will get more people playing online than Stock Car Extreme did and I'm looking forward to some nice polished mods because this SIM is just fantastic! It looks better than Stock Car Extreme and sounds better too, although some sounds (touring cars) and visuals (mostly interior models) need improvment and there are some graphical bugs here and there that existed in Stock Car Extreme as well. I have to say that so far I'm pretty stoked with this sim and I will be putting hundreds of hours in to this before long.Physics - 9.5Graphics - 7.1Sounds - 7.8Content - 9.0Can't wait to see what elese is coming from Reiza!

												I don't bother writing many reviews (so far) but feel this game really deserves one.By far my favourite simulator on the market at the moment and and I have done a lot of hours in all of the competition except for RRE and iRacing due to the cost (esp in the case of the latter).It is difficult to describe but the game feels absolutely spot on as far as simulation goes. I think much of that comes from the amazingly communicative force feedback which seems to have no lag whatsover. You really feel connected to the car and can really get in the ""zone"". The level of immersion is fantastic as far as i'm concerned. If you rate a decent game engine and realism above everything else I would definitely recommend this over the other titles at the moment (although I also rate rF2). I think perhaps Reiza really understand the importance of input repsonse and feedback.Many thanks Reiza for persevering with simulation and not selling out.  "

												Tons of variety with a satisfying feel!DISCLAIMER: Just a heads up that my review is coming from a racing sim noob with a Logitech G27 Racing Wheel plugged in a ""toaster"". I only play offline as well. So the pros, gear snobs, sim veterans, and club racers won't find much useful information within. And probably already have a heavy opinion anyway. I will try to gear this review towards the uninitiated and curious sim noobs like myself that are stumbling about Steam reviews behind the cheap steering wheel with genuine curiosity of whats out there. I had a very positive ""Early Access"" review of this title up, something I wouldn't normally do. The game was more or less feature complete though. And I gushed and fawned over the game like an eager fanboy with a new shiny toy. I've learned a thing or two along the way since and ratcheted things down a bit. But honestly, the shine hasn't worn off. 90hrs (plus more in the beta branch) of driving, crashing, learning, and even occasionally actually racing all by myself and I haven't even scuffed the sheen a bit. Its always a blast when you're on the road and even sometimes off it. Starting with the obvious; Variety is the spice of life and Automobilista delivers that in full. I can race in an open-wheeler that I prefer on a major track I love and know like the back of my hand... Or I can take an unwieldy Super Truck I can't handle on a track I've never heard of. Karts, Super V8's, formulas of every era, Caterhams, Camaros, Lancers, and much more. With more coming still! Each vehicle series looks, handles, and feel superb AND wholly unique. The track variety contains some classics as well as the obscure. They're all worth the time to learn and race. And the user made mods have been rolling out steadily since Early Access and only add more variety and options (HUDs/tracks/cars/skins/etc). But the real feature(s) that made it all worth it for me was the accessibility. I got my wheel for much tamer and/or ""arcade-y"" racing games. Then I ended up playing casual ""sims"" with it, towing trailers across Europe and logs through the mud in Russia. But when it came time to step up and strap in to a cockpit of something serious to really feel my toy wheel I ran into walls and dead ends at every turn. ""True sim"" racing is a niche if there ever was such a thing. An odd one with unique folks owning a wealth of information scattered wide and far. And with even more varying steadfast opinions filling each and every gap between. I poured hours into trying this sim or that sim. Reading webpages, blogs, and forums. Calibrating software, looking up force feedback settings, learning new terms, fiddling with in-game settings, trying to make old games work on new operating systems. And I always ended up with something that barely worked and left me thinking I was missing something. With Automobilista I read one thing, the included manual, and set things as suggested. Within minutes I was racing. And for the first time I FELT it. I felt what seduces souls the world over and turns them into sim racing fanatics. Force feedback and simulating physics is an amazing thing. Automobilista just works (granted you read a manual) and allowed me to finally start learning how to race and actually play a game rather than just how to configure things. Though, since it indeed ""just worked"" it did also let me learn how to configure things and know what settings should do and let me return to previous failures and succeed in trying things. In basic terms Automobilista starts you at step ""1"" and it sure is easier to start at step ""1"" instead of step ""35"", or ""-35""!There's plenty of other subjective stuff I could go on about like how I do think its the best feeling sim out there and technical this or tire model that or how I like the visuals plenty fine. But the subjective opinion I will stand by the most is that this is the most approachable sim for the new guy/gal. That's not to say your journey will be as smooth as mine or it doesn't take some reading or work. And no promises you'll be any good. As with anything you're gonna get out what you put in with sim racing. My hours spent learning and configuring other games and scouring the web was never wasted, it just wasn't rewarded or fulfilling until it culminated in Automobilista. But knowledge is your friend in this niche. Learn and study anything you can get your hands on and just remember most of it is subjective in the end. The world doesn't need another steadfast stone that won't flex on anything. Find what you like and what works for you and know others should do the same. But if you got a wheel (and make no mistake a wheel is highly recommended if not flat out required) and you want to see what the hubbub is all about with sim racing without subscriptions or anything wacky, I can confidently suggest Automobilista is a good bet. Very much recommended!			"

												For those of you that stayed away from Stock Car Extreme thinking it was just an rFactor mod, give Automobilista a try.  This game is Reiza taking the ISI Motor and really turning it into something of their own.  All of the content is solid, and the stadium trucks and rallycross Lancer are Reiza showing they can nail any type of car.  I can't wait to see what else come to this game and the future Reiza project.			"

												The new rFactor.This game is what Reiza have built after acquiring the rights to use the source code for the gmotor 2 engine and what they have made is a more polished, advanced version of rfactor with far more detailed physics and force feedback. I predict this will become the go-to platform for modders. Assetto Corsa looks great, but has poor AI and strange physics quirks that lead to mod creators having to use values that don't match real-life values when making cars.I think this will become the go-to platform for modders that rFactor was in the past generation of sims.If you don't care about that, the stock content that comes with the game is also excellent. Now with cool features like flat spotting of tyres, and tracks that rubber as the race progresses. Excellent sounds and the new shaders make the game look quite nice, though still not as fancy looking as Assetto Corsa.A great Sim with a lot of variety in the car and track selection with a good amount of quality mod content available that is only going to get larger.

												If you are into hardcore sim racing titles, get this one or rf2.Miles ahead of every other so called sim title and i own multiple older and current competitor games:Pro AMS:- high frequency physics and ffb updates- dynamic roads- dynamic time of day- wide range of different cars- obscure tracks you don't find in other sims + mod tracks to get the ones you know- low system requirements meaning you can play this on eyefinity in 5760x1200 with 60fps- easy to mod- limited eyecandy = better concentration, less errors due to OH LOOK A SHINY THING- gearbox simulation with grinding gears, double downshift protection, realism stuff- per car driving help options, ie. you can disable ABS overall but have it activated for the MiniEDIT:- online experience will be expanded (time trial leader boards, official servers, league finder...)Contra AMS:- No dynamic weather- obscure tracks you probably have never seen- no dynamic shadows- limited eyecandy- online participation low b/c game not as popular as PCars or AC- rFactor 1 like AI, i guess there were changes in AIW files, but not in the overall AI behaviorEDIT:- on mod Tracks buggy HUD (dynHUD), i resort to the base HUD in that case- rf1 AI Problems. No defensive lines, problems on lap 1, problems in slow cornersLast but not least. Amazing Company. Amazing Support! I got this game for free because i owned GSCE and Forumla Truck. This was my free update, and there is more free stuff beeing added every month it seems. Can't wait for DLCs and Reiza2017 Project.EDIT:Well, free content is not coming every month anymore. A few free bits are problably still coming...There are now DLCs announced and i brought the SeasonPass to save money.Fully Recommended!EDIT:Alter 100+hours still fully recommended!Having a blast with the CommunityTimeTrials on RaceDepartment			"

												Oh man - I used my refund money from Nascar Heat Evolution (been waiting for a pure nascar sim since 2003... am still waiting, NHR is absolute junk) - that refund money -  to buy this sim. And a little extra to get it with the Season Pass.My god - set it to harcore sim settings and holy ♥♥♥♥, I get right into the Formula V10 and was immedietly shocked at how great the car felt, not even two hours in and it most certainly makes  great use of the ISI (RFactor) engine -  better than even RFactor itself, feels way more real than the old GTR/WTCC series, and  physics are totally Superior to SimRaceWay (another ISI engine project). The FFB is amazing, the sounds are great (mostly, some cars sound weird), and damn I never knew brazil had such amazing race tracks. And the best thing ever - THERE ARE FREAKING SUPER TRUCKS IN HERE. HOLY HELL - they are insane to drive with all assists turned off - and super challenging to keep under control when you come off the ramps - totally nuts to control on the gas during a corner exit - but insanely fun!I wanted a pure hardcore sim - and damn, this title does it well, even if the graphics are a bit dated, graphics mean nothing if the game itself is fun. So many new tracks to learn, plenty of content - finally a racing sim that has me super excited - I hope I get plenty of free time to learn all these unfamiliar tracks, just the two I have tried were astoundingly interesting. Obviously brazil loves to throw chicanes right after full-throttle-open sectors of track, I predict many flat spots to appear on my tyres in the weeks to come.Certainly the best use of the ISI engine I have ever tried (in my opinion of course). Was also super easy and quick to get my DFGT wheel setup with this.I have been looking for a super fun (and super hardcore) racing sim since my old LFS and NR2003 days, and 2016 has been a horrible drag:  - Assetto Corsa, great, but the addiction is starting to fade. - Tried F12016,  refunded - silly simcade physics and weird car handling. - Tried Nascar Heat Evolution, refunded - totally an arcade racer with a so called ""sim mode"" but does not have any form of realistic and believable handling  - nore do the cars actually stear more than100 degrees either direction (also, non linear steering appears to be build specifically with console players and gamepads in mind). Also - crap physics. - Rfactor2. Really pretty - really cool tyre model, plenty of content - but somehow is lacking in something special that I cant put my finger on. - Project Cars: <-- I wont touch this with a 10 ft pole. - Automobolista: Where the ♥♥♥♥ is the advertising for this sim, I should have discovered this ages ago, it's certainly a gem.

												I only picked up sim racing last year after i bought a t300. One of the best choices i ever made, since then i am hooked. Started with Project Cars and it felt ""real"". I loved how all of a sudden i got some sort of rollercoaster in my own house. Amazing. Soon after i added F1 2016 to my collection. Also awesome. Also felt ""real"".I had no idea. Then i bought Automobilista. At first i didn't like it. The menu's and all around presentation seem to be from a previous era, same goes for the graphics. Also basically every car i drover got in a spin as soon as i tries to take a fast or technical corner. I was used to the more arcade approach of PC and F12016 and went back to those games. I guess just to comfort myself and to have an easy drive. Put after a while i came back to Automobilista. I knew i had to give it another chance. I started riding simple ovals in all kinds of cars and started to geta feeling for them. And that feeling grew. It only took a couple of hours before i understood how to drive a ""real"" car. And it was amazing. Now just 36 hours in and i am hooked. This game let's you set up basically every race on every track available. Most tracks are unknown tracks from Brazil, but their detail is top notch. The force feedback is just from another planet. You feel every bump, every line. It is simply amazing. Autmobilista is one of the best if not the best simulators on the market imo. Also tried iracing and Asetto Corsa, but Automobilista is the game i'll use to get beter at sim racing. Having an absolute blast. Would buy again. Masterpiece.			"

								If you didn't already own Stock Car Extreme, then shame on you, but if you do, this is exactly what you would want in the next evolution of the game and Reiza's dedicated team of developers. The best part is, you get it for free. New content such as RallyX and Stadium Trucks even more depth to this game and are some of the best fun I've had in Reiza-produced content.The sim has received a huge significant visual overhaul and improvements to virtually every aspect of the game, from the tire model, physics, etc. to even the menus. If you are in the market for a new sim, this is now one of the best you can get, just like Stock Car Extreme has been for a long time, especially for the price. I would even recommend this to people new to sims. There's a plethora of assists to guide you, and a super easy hop-in-and-play style to the main menu. I can't wait to see how this Early Access model benefits the studio as a whole as we see bug fixes and content consistantly added before 1.0,			"

												If I could just have one sim I'd probably take this one. Great bang for the bucks! All major series included (F1, F3, Porsche Cup, V8 Supercars etc) and some smaller (Formula Vee, Supertrucks, Brazilian Stockcar etc), which are great fun nonetheless. Keep in mind that these series mostly use fantasy names and liveries, however the game is modable and there are several skinpacks available. Also there are plenty of good addon-tracks and cars out there (make sure to download the CART mod, it's spectacular). With the brit pack arriving soon this sim will improve once again with three new tracks and cars like Caterhams, Formula Ford, Ultima GTR (street and road version) and MCR 2000. In my opinion the FFB and physics in Automobilista are one of the best. Only downside: if you are looking for online action you'll have to join a league, because public MP is a wasteland, unfortunately.			"

Early Access Review
If you want a realistic racing experience - one that gets you about as close as you can get to the real thing - buy this game.First, I need to say the I am a backer in the crowdfunding campaign for Stock Car Extreme, the game that became Automobilista. But there is a reason why I backed the campaign to begin with. SCE is an excellent game and Automobilista is an even better one. The physics and force feedback in Automobilista are second to none. I was blown away when I first tried SCE and it keeps geting better here. I just did a race where I locked up my front right tire and flat spotted it. I could feel the vibration through my steering wheel for the rest of the race and had to be very careful not to make it worse.The AI are some of the best anywhere, which, if you play mostly off line as I do, is huge.The graphics have improved dramatically and yet performance hasn't suffered at all.The car and track line up contains content you won't find anywhere else as well as some very familiar stuff as well. The modding community is active and very talented. Automobilista has been out in early access for less than a day and there is already an excellent track mod (Nurburgring)  as well as some skins and a couple hud mods. More are soon to follow.Communication with the developers is excellent and they back what they sell. They are racing fans who made a great game.I'm sure I could go on and on but If you want a realistic racing experience - one that gets you about as close as you can get to the real thing - buy this game.

								This is one of my favorite sims. The physics leave little to be desired, the AI is fantastic, and the force feedback is the second best I have tried. Niels is a genius.. I play almost every sim on the market, but I was late to the party with this one, and i gotta say, I was missing a lot. The Reiza content is fantastic, and it also has a great mod community, with the best mods from RFactor available (only updated and upgraded), and original mod content as well. The physics and force feedback aren't quite at RFactor 2's level, but the content is possibly superior in range of vehicles you get. Nothing matches the best cars in RF2, but it also doesn't have any below average content, and every single car is worthy of your time. That said, after discovering RFACTOR 2, I have been spending a lot less time here. My only complaint is that the online community is lacking, but the fault lies on us consumers and not the game itself. If you haven't tried it yet, do it. Do IT! As soon as possible, do it! If you are into sim racing, I would say this is a must have title. Forget the other big names coming out right now, as they may be prettier, but none of them will give you the complete package and amazing wheel to wheel racing experience that this does. They fixed the UI issues since GSCE and now the whole thing looks a lot more polished, with new colours, design, and on HUD while racing. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that Reiza is always updating, and releasing FREE new content to people who own it. There isn't a better value for your money out there. See you on the track!

												AMS doesn't have the visuals of AC or pCars and it doesn't reach rF2's physics, yet it's the one sim i start up while all others (i own all the big ones, old and new) just get launched every now and then to justify having them installed on my SSD.AMS has great unique content, the cars feel and sound great and the developer Reiza is really in love with their baby and they are incredibly fast in developing this title further.

												After years of xbox racing and becoming increasingly frustrated with the mountain of problems project cars and currently assetto corsa are having getting the games to work properly i finally bit the bullet and got a pc just for my racing and bought this after watching friends streaming this on twitch, i cant find anything bad to say about this because it has so much to offer and delivers it so well,The physics are brilliant....really good, you feel connected to the car and track, each car feels different with their own characteristics which keeps you on your toes, the open wheelers are insane to drive......so much fun. if you lock up you will feel the flat spots on your tyres, marbles off the racing line will make you slide around, aero is effected while slipstreaming other cars. you can feel everything and the tweekabilty is good.the car list is very good and i think there is something for everyone in here, Karts through to F1, touring cars, gt cars old and new,DTM the list goes on.track list is good also with classic versions on some which i really like (1988 layout of imola for example, and current layout) graphics are good, ok you can see they arent as polished and up to date with the other current games but they really arent bad at all and to be honest you dont really notice while your trying to keep the car on track, id say personally they are more than sufficient there are plenty of mods available which really flood the game with more goodness.If you are looking for a good racing sim this is the one for you it has alot to offer and will put a smile on your face as it has done for me.Enjoy :)			"

												Try the 1975 F1 car, called 'Formula Retro'.Try the 'Test day'.Pick you car and pick 'Johannesburg' as your track. This was the old Kyalami race circuit.Remove the 'Electronic aids' listed in the garage, and do so again in the 'Options' menu.Reduce the tyre pressures to 17.8 for the front, and 18.3 for the rear.Alter the camber to '0'.Now go and drive...Remember, the tyres are cold for the first lap, so don't push too hard yet.Hopefully you'll be getting a 'feel' for the car, and it should bring a smile to your face...After a while, you may feel confident enough to post a time on the 'Time trial', and you'll soon realise how much you want to do better...  ...and you get another go in 1m 13 seconds or so! Exhilarating isn't the word!Once I'd realised where all the 'Electronic aids' were in the menus, and removed them, I began to live.Even some time in the tardy Formula Vee helped my understanding of weight transfer.It's easy to over drive the car, and you need to control yourself to get the best out of it. And then there's the circuits...OLD Interlagos, with its fearsome double-apex first corner. I was taking the first part at 163mph! It takes your breath away.At Brasilia you'll begin to learn how to deal with the lack of grip. At Cascavel you'll have yor breath taken away again.The first corner is a full 180 degrees in fifth gear, ultimately leading into a VERY fast 4th gear left hander before you have to anchor it for a slow right. It's awesome!At Kansai, which is in fact Suzuka, you will be seriously challenged by the lack of grip. It's literally rally-driving a F1 car!Imagine taking a car like this to Britain's Cadwell park? It's a motorcycle track after all.Imagine no longer! Hanging on to this car at Cadwell requires your bravery as well as your judgement.Then you watch the replay and think, ""Wow, this is also fantastic to watch!""Having played 'Grand Prix Legends' in the past, now being able to drive the Brabham is fantastic, nothing less.My frustrations are with the dreaded 'understeer' on everything, but it's easily controllable on the Brabham 'Formula retro', but I'm trying to engineer it out, which is quite a challenge.Having learned some set-up lessons from the Formula Retro, hopefully I can apply them to the other cars should I choose to try them.The graphics are fine by me, and anyway, it's the feel of the car that matters.I use a cheap Thrustmaster (Non-force feedback) steering wheel, which works very well.I'm really pleased with this game. It's frustrating but very rewarding trying really hard to get the best out of that old Brabham.			"

												After a crowdfunding campaign to inject additional life and content into its premiere racing title, Reiza studios released a rebranded and updated take on their highly praised title Game Stock Car Extreme. Does their attempt to revitalize their existing flagship title offer enough new features to go head to head with the heavyweights in the racing genre, or does it fall short, almost being a prequel to bigger and better things to come?

								One of the best racing simulators available.Plenty of cars and tracks, some of them not that famous which is a bonus point. With this nice variety there is content for most of the people to enjoy. I never get bored with the default content and get plenty of enjoyment out of it.Great physics and FFB that give you the feeling of driving the real car. Jump form car to car and you can feel the diferences and all the little quirks of that particular racing machine.It doesn't have the flashy graphics that other modern titles have but when you're driving you soon forget that and enjoy the great experience.A simulator that everyone who likes this genre should have.

												I have always been a big racing fan but I have always been restricted to console gaming so there I have never really had the opportunity to play Sim Racing games, recently I invested in a gaming rig, steering wheel, pedals etc for my PC. I wanted to get into Sim Racing and so I shopped around all the big players, downloaded demos, subscribed to services, and tried the free to play content of most the the games. Automobilista was the game that I liked the most and the one that I consider the best racing sim. I tried I-racing and although the online mode is the best I didn't think the physics model was as realistic as many people had said. Next I tried Project Cars and it was near indentical to my Xbox one version and although I love the force feedback the game is more simcade. I also tried Rfactor2 and RaceRoom Experience, although Automobilista isn't the best in every catergory (graphics, online, car selection, licences, physics etc) it is pretty close to the best in all of these, where the other games all had large weaknesses I think that this game is good/great in all departments. A definite must buy for all Sim Racers			"

												This is a bit of a hidden jewel in the Sim Racing land. I could write a lengthy positive review but I'll just say it's put me the closest to feeling like I'm driving a race car I've ever had. The feel and the sound of the game is intoxicating and the game is that easy to run you can ramp up pretty much everything to make it look a damn site better than this old rf1 engine  has any right to look. If you are willing to spend a little time finding a club and getting involved you'll have one of the best virtual acing experiences you can get - and the single player is excellent too. This game deserves to take off.			"

								The marginal ingame time doesn't represent the total time I've spent in this game, as I've mostly been using the Beta.- Finally a proper tyre model- Finally a proper racing line- Okay, still missing proper international tracks, but they will come!- Great F1 2002 car! Also generally great selection of cars, V8 Supercars, StockCars, F1 Cars from all eras, F3, FVee(It's a thing!) and so on. Stadium trucks are also quite cool, Rallycross is not on par with Dirt Rally, but a sweet gimmick.- Way better car behavior and feedback than GSC, nearly on par with rFactor 2 and much preferable to games like Assetto Corsa (yees, it's a matter of taste, put the pitchforks back)- The menu music is cool!- The AI is too slow for some cars, e.g. F1 2002.- No, this is not an arcarde racer, if you only own a keyboard, this might not be the game for you! Without a steering wheel, this is of no use, so don't complain!Ultimately this might be the number one sim on the market right now, which is especially astonishing if you consider that the developer just recently acquired the license for the engine of the game and will still improve it. Lots to come!			"

								Automobilista is, by far, the best and most complete sim racing out there right now.Althought the guts of this sim is essentially Stock Car Extreme, what Reiza accomplished with Automobilista is right down impressive. I saw improvement in pretty much every aspect of the sim. And don't forget, there is more to come.Few highlights:- Force Feedback is in the same level of rFactor 2- All cars physics are outstanding- Selection of cars is excelent- Selection of track is also extremely good- Reiza's support and comunication is well above standards- Neils Heusinkveld!!- F1 V10!!- You don't need a fancy PC to run this sim @ 60fps with max graphics- So far, public racing is rather clean and very funIf you are a hardcore sim racing, chances are you already own Automobilista, and enjoy it very much.However, I hugely recommend it to everyone else, especially if you want to start your sim racing adiction.I am having a blast with a ~$600 PC build and a T300RS.Cheers			"

												It's a great simulation game, to drive versus the A.I. There are different series to drive, and you could set all races to your desire. The FFB feels great, like in iRacing. So you wheel feel bumbs on the road, etc.. not only force feedback when you steer. The A.I. is very competitive. At 70% it's like HARD. There are also enough mods / tracks / series to play. It's more advanced then the more popular game, Assetto Corsa.			"

												handling wise it's the best sim out there. the differrence between cold and warm tires is spot on. loosing grip on marbles is also nicely done. it is the only sim i played that really feels right, like you were driving a racecar. even though it's not easy it is possible to drift the cars in a manner some sims don't allow you (caugh*iracing*caugh).it's IMPORTANT to set the sim up properly before you start any driving. especially the steering lock is crucial since most of the cars have a very lazy steering lock setting. ramp it up to about 20-24 and off you go. actually this is the biggest drawback of this sim - the long setting up process. the content that is there is top notch. cars although not the hottest (except for open-wheelers since those are great) are really enjoyable to drive and many of the obscure brazilian tracks are nice too. there are time trial challenges on every car/track combination which is nice. the BrittPack DLC is really, really good. the caterhams are crazy and a lot of fun to throw around. oulton park is laser scanned which is nice since i know the track from iracing very well. The Imola track DLC has 4 layouts including 72 historic which is totally different to the more modern ones.a lot of rFactor 1 mods are compatible with Automobilista which is a huge plus in my book (note that AI can behave strange on mod tracks. the AI on original tracks is actually pretty good and there are options to set them up to your liking (agressiveness etc.)it's worth mentioning that if you're an F1 fan and you'd like to find out why you'd suck as an F1 driver this is the sim for you. it has a single representation of an F1 car from every decade, starting with the 60's and they're all challenging, fun and distinct (the modern ones less so IMO). as far as i know it is the only sim that does that.the GRAPHICS are decent enough, car models and cockpits are detailed, just don't expect Assetto Corsa levels of fidelity.SOUND is very good in general. especially F1 and the recently released cars sound convincing.MENUS are a bit of a throwback, but you can get use to it.never tried ONLINE, since random races are not my thing and i'm still waiting till someone's gonna kick iracings ♥♥♥ in this regard (the cost of iracing is just nuts)all in all i recommend Automobilista to those that are patient (the setup etc.) and value the driving experience/realism above all else. this is the top of the crop driving experience for a decent price.Oh, STEERING WHEEL and PEDALS are a must for this game. playing it any other way just doesn't make sense. ***************HIGHLY RECOMMENDED******************			"

								My experience... I have been driving Grand Prix Legends since it was released in 1998. I have tried iRacing, fFactor 2, and Assetto Corsa. In my opinion Automobilista is a more realistic driving experience than all of them. From my first session on track I was convinced. Now that I've spent some more time dialing things in, I'm hooked. When you first start out, be sure to take the time to peruse the ""user guide"". The physics and ffb had me convinced immediately but the graphics were washed out. After reading the ""user guide"" on configuring Nvidia/ATI graphics cards and applying the recommended settings, the graphics are very good. The ffb is the best I have experienced. I'm still using my old faithful Logitech Momo Red wheel and an even older, modded, set of Thrustmaster pedals with a Flexiforce load sensor on the brake. I was going to test drive Project Cars but there's no need. I am quite happy with Automobilista. I would recommend Automobilista to anyone who is looking for a sim with realistic handling and feedback. If you are looking for more of an arcade experience, there is nothing to see here.Some thoughts on:iRacing... I quite liked iRacing but for me the ffb was not very good. A bit like driving underwater. I tried different settings but never found anything I was satisfied with. That said; I would stay with iRacing just for the sheer number of online races that are available, except for the cost. Ongoing subscription and then track and car purchases to move up the ranks are too much for me.rfactor 2... Great graphics but physics and ffb just seem unrealistic to me.Assetto Corsa... I thought the graphics in rfactor 2 were better on my 32"" monitor. AC was too sparkly and I was unable to adjust to eliminate the sparkles. And again the physics and ffb weren't realistic to me.Final thought... of course all of this is subjective and may largely depend on your rig.			"

								Ok so after spending a few hours with the game and keeping in mind its stills early access, this game is great!!  I love sim racing games and if you check my library I own allot of them.  If you are looking at reviews deciding between games like Pcars, Assetto Corsa, and Automobilista they all have something to offer so get them all.  My main arguments for this game is the AI is really good,  one example is the driver spun out recovered and fault like hell to prevent from being lapped.  I can honestly say  I never experienced anything like that.  Physics and FFB are superior as well.  Graphics are a little dated but just like when im playing GTR2 or Race07 I dont care, its all about the driving experience.			"

								Great selection of cars, with everything from older Formula 1 cars, 2014 f1, Rallycross aswell as various stock cars and lots of other cars. The tracks are mostly South American, so apart from Interlagos you might find yourself a little lost if you are used to Spa and Nüburgring. For some this is a huge plus, since it means that you get to try new tracks. Some people really don't like it, since they went to drive on the same maps they are used to.Another major complaint from people are the graphics. Since the game is still based on the rfactor engine, the graphics are of course not the prettiest. Personally, it doesn't really bother me, since the ffb and the physics are more important than the graphics.			"

												I had been considering buying AMS for a while now but couldn't decide whether it was worth getting since I own so many other sims and wasn't convinced it would offer me anything different. I almost felt like i was buying in to the sim racing past rather than the future. Eventually however it was in the sale at a good price and happily I am not disappointed. The content is interesting and varied and the driving experience convincing. I feared it may just be a mix on the Rfactor theme, which it is to an extent, but the extra features such as the dynamic track and updated FFB make it worthwhile. The graphics are not as ancient as some may have you believe - sure its no Assetto Corsa but they are good enough and run very smoothly with everything cranked up to maximum.More importantly the driving experience makes a lot of sense and it is actually fun to play. I feel all the current sims have their strengths, I already own R3E, RF2, iracing and Assetto Corsa. AMS compares favourably to them all and in some respects has exceeded my expectations. Considering the amount you can spend on other sims which use a subscription and/or paid content business model AMS is certainly good value and a sim that any dedicated sim racer should not be without!

								I've been using this Racing Sim in the last few years and here we are with Automobilista. An upgrade from GSC. A big upgrade that is. Looks better and sounds better. Though it may not have the flash visuals as some of it's peers, it's all about pure MotorSport. No gimmicks such as cheesy voiceovers and flashy pitstops with your crew going through an animation to wow your onlookers. I would definetly recommend a wheel with forcefeedback as you would be missing out on an experience. Get yourself in one of the eighties F1 cars, get her warmed up, get into the zone. The sense of speed and feel is absorbing. Plenty of variation in vehicles to race. Series & Circuits you may never of heard off. Don't let it put you off as i feel it's refreshing to test and race on circuits i'm not that familiar with & it's a change from the usual selection we usually get in racing sims. Great that Reiza give it free to existing GSC users. They deserve the credit as they seem to care about the product and update it from time to time to improve it. If your after a proper Motorsport sim this is the one i would recommend.			"

								Great! but turn off the DynaHud if you have a toaster like me, it kills fps for some reason! The Sweetfx look  nice and natural and the sound engine of the game has been nicely upgraded,   Everything sounds much less computery (compared to GSCE) and more natural.  Both really welcome upgrades.  (Yes, you can get Sweetfx for GSCE and rfactor, but you can't upgrade the ancient sound engine like Rieza has done here.) The FFB for me ( DFGT user here ) is much much better in ways, although isn't as strong as GSCE ( 100% in AMS is not the same 100% in GSCE). But it FEELS better imho.  Its almost..ALMOST rfactor2 levels, for me at least. Nice details in all the bumps and colisions, and again, it FEELS more natural, hehe..So buy it! If you love racing.			"

								Wow what a great upgrade...I wasn't expecting much of Automobilista since it's really a GSCE v1.5, but it's a big step forward. It's improved in every department!Graphics is a big improvement, textures/lighting is heaps better than GSCE...I prefer it over RF2 actually. Performance is faultless on my system, no stutter whatsoever where as GSCE gave me the occasional stutter. Only gripes so far are need more 3d grass and some textures flicker in replays.Menus are more polished/sophisticated and easy to navigate.Sounds have improved too imo, the engine noise is more raw, classic F1 sound incredible.Physics/ffb feels more or less the same as in GSCE to me which isn't a bad thing. The AI racing is superb, just finished a f3 race and it's a joy to see the AI sliding all over the place in front of you. The new trucks are a blast to drive, although I do not enjoy the rally cross lancer, they should leave the rally stuff to codies and concentrate on road racing.The only thing that l will complain about is the lack of more exciting road cars, I hope Reiza's next title will be based on the rf2 engine with more liscensed content like AC.

								Yes, this is just another ""mod"" for rFactor. However, they have squeezed everything they can get out of it. I run many, many sims including rFactor 1 and 2, SCE, Assetto Corsa and iRacing. This is by far better than all but iRacing. I like Assetto Corsa, but the feel is way different. Mad kudos to Reizia Studios for this product. If you liked any of the SimBin games (also on the rFactor engine), get this product...now bring on the mods (Steam Workshop!?!)			"

								Such an incredible and underrated racing simulator by one of the best game developers out there. If you love racing and the thrill of driving on the edge, this is a must have. Such a wonderful variety of vehicles to choose from and the physics are just second to none with fantastic force feedback. The sim is already fantastic and just continues to get better with every update. Pros: Too many to mention. Personal favorites are the Formula V10, Formula Vee, and those incredibly fun Stadium Trucks. Cons: Not enough hours in the day to play this as much as I want to. Just get it already. You're wasting precious time reading this when you should be taking that b!tchin' truck through a high speed corner on three wheels just before hitting a ramp and flying through the air. Which is where I'm headed now... \m/10/10 - Can't get enough of this much fun.			"

												 AFTER APPROX 8 HOURS GAMEPLAY1. Look, Feel and GUI.  . The way the GUI is set out is very intuative. It does not takc long for you to get used to the menu. Everything is at your  fingertips. I actually like the way it is set up. Although the game looks and feels a little bit dated it still up there with Assetto and PC,2. The racing.  . Very very hard learning curve. Once you get it though it's hard to race anything else. It just looks, feels like you are driving a race car. This game is not for the faint hearted.

								VIDEO AVAILABLE AT www.twitch.tv/ramalls.  WOW!  All I can say is ............. WOW!  iRacing, watch out.  This game currently cost 30 bucks with no residual cost (as of this writing).  Let's talk racing simulation.  1. Car physics.  Automobilista has nailed it!  The different cars have different physics and handling characteristics that you can feel!  Tire wear, suspension travel, brakes, camber.....you make adjustments and you feel the difference.  2. Dynamic tracks and tire wear. I swear while I was racing in the F3 car I could see my tires degrading over time............not just feel it but see it.  Now, maybe it's just because you have real time telemetry data that tells you what your tire state is, but I kept looking at my right front tire and I could swear I started seeing tread wear. Anyway, they have their tire model spot on.........and it's only going to get better.  The tires pick up gravel and grass if you run off the road and you can hear it on the pavement also.  Run behind someone that has ran off the road and hear the dirt and gravel ping and pong off your car's underbelly.  Great job.  3.  Force Feedback.  THIS RIGHT HERE PEOPLE IS WHAT FORCE FEEDBACK IS ALL ABOUT.  They got it right..........on the first try none the less.  There are a number of default setups for almost every racing wheel you can think of.  G27, G29, MoMo, driving force..........if you have a wheel, it's probably supported here.  (CAUTION:  This is a TRUE racing sim, so please don't attempt to drive with a gamepad.  I see some support is in there, but you really are not going to get the full experience).  4.  Graphics.  This is where some pundants say that Automobilista is failing.  I say that they are a small team of developers with a small budget that have created a simulation that is DIRECTLY  challenging Assetto Corsa, iRacing, RFactor, etc.  If I was to put the graphics to a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a solid 7.............but remember, this is an Early Access of the game.  How may of you remember Assetto Corsa's early access. Pretty damn strong graphics........horrible physics.  Automobilista is headed in the right direction.  5.  AI.  I know, I know...........who wants AI in a simulation racer.  Let's be honest, there isn't a racing sim out there that can compete with the online community of iRacing.  You ALWAYS find human racers to compete with.  That's not to say that Automobilista doesn't have a mulitplayer community.  Indeed, you can log on and find some multiplayer races.  However, the community has not expanded yet.  Therefore, you NEED AI to get some traffice time it.  The scaleable AI here is some of the best I've seen in a racing sim yet.  They truly try to find the best path around you for a pass and seem to attempt to avoid all contact.  5.  Complaints. As I said earlier, this is an early access of the game.  However, I want to be sure to let everyone know if some of the downsides that I think exists.  First, you will notice some clipping when you collide with certain artifacts in the game.  It's nothing that ruins the overall realism and fun of the sim, however, it's there. Also, there seems to be some scaling issues with a few of the tracks. Montreal's straights seem to be pretty short.  Speaking of tracks, there are curently 0 American Road  Courses in the game.  Hopefully this will change..........(Long Beach, St Petersburg......FORGET Laguna Seca).  There are also a lot of tracks that are either new to me or not real world tracks.  When setting up a single player practice session, you have to manually add the AI cars..............ONE CAR AT A TIME.....CLICK.....CLICK.....CLICK.... Hopefully this will get changed.  6.  Speaking of cars............There are several in here that are not mainstream to your typcial racer.  COPA is something complete new to me.............and I love it.  COPA MONTANA are GT trucks that are pretty damn fun to drive.  The other COPA (sorry cannot remember the spelling or name) is GT Hondas Civics and Cheverolets.  Pretty damn fun to run these rice burners.  There are also SUPER V8 TRUCKS and tracks (imaging dirt rally truck on a race track with buitl in jumps).  Definitely a change of pace.  What doesn't exist right now are true GT3/GT1 cars.  All in all, I'm really excited to see what Reiza is going to do with this simulation.  They have definitely come out swinging and are directly challenging the mainstream racing simulations on the market today.  This is how you do an early access game here........(hint hint hiht Star Citizen).  Looking forward to more to come.  I'll update this review as new content comes out.  See you on the track!!Oh, if you want to see video, check out my twitch page at http://www.twitch.tv/ramalls   Enjoy.   "

												Ok, If your are new to this, Automobilista is actually the next version of Stock Car Extream. I've been playing the beta version of this game, so don't let my game time here put you off this review.I've heard many reports that this is just rFactor all over again. Yes it uses the rFactor engine, but what has been achieved here far exceeds what any others have managed. If you were to get rFactor, download all the best mods, set up everything perfectly, follow guides etc.. you would not come close to what this game does out the box, without mods.You actually do not need to add mods at all. In most cases you will in fact undue the great work that has gone on here if you do.There are some mod added tracks available that are Automobilista quality, but try to avoid filling up the locations folder...just because you can. Stick with the original content and drive until you can do it well.If you want the best visuals, then buy Project cars, otherwise look no further, unless online racing is all you do, in which case go iRacing. Thanks to everyone who has worked on this project. It is fantastic. Shame nobody reads these reviews.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm enjoying this game very much. I had the previous game from Reiza Studios, Stock Car Extreme, and this game builds upon that game with more polish and more tracks, cars and the like. It's not a Forza or Project Cars type of game, with fantastic graphics. But the graphics are more than enough to support the racing and it also means it can run well on less than uber hardware. The racing is very good. All the bells and whistles are there for setups. And there are a lot of options for control layouts. I use an X360 controller since I'm more of a causal racer and the game easily supports this. And the large number of different car classes means a player can find a number of different cars that appeal to you. And there is a whole range of assists so whether you are a newbie or a hardcore sim racer you can find the assist options that you prefer. Finally, there is a healthy mod community already in place to support this game. There are already a zillion skins, several new cars and tracks and a bunch of other mods. And there is a good vetting system for these mods so you aren't downloading lots of dross hoping to find a bit of gold.			"

												Well, finally after finding my way back to Simracing, I checked out AMS after quite some time. It got incredibly high quality and high standards. Of course, that's why Reiza can keep it that cheap, you hardly have licensed cars, but that's not the point I'd focus on. First of all, I've driven mainly the Formula V12 and V10. They are amazing with their high speeds and at the same time it never feels too fast. Remembering other games with GT1 Cars, it always felt like they were way too fast everywhere. Here you got clear limits, great control and quite some room to play with gas, brakes and wheel. This is what you got on all cars in the game. It feels authentic, and it looks like that as well when watching the replay. The good thing is, that modders already created several skinpacks for several seasons of those Formula 1 Cars.Next car I really love is the BoxerCup, which is basically a Porsche Cup Car. It is surprisingly well to control while it is at the same time a classic oversteery Porsche. Great fun, but sometimes maybe a bit frustrating if you're not practiced with this stuff. But it's a lot of fun.Another thing I tried for the first time is the Rallye Cross Car. Damn! You got an awesome control over the car and it's huge fun to drift around with it.Another awesome thing is the flatspotting of the tires. You can see them on the tires and you really feel them. The wheel and car start to shake around and it becomes much harder to drive in a clean line. Great feature!There are for sure many more cars I could tell about, but now the tracks:They are done very nicely with all those bumps. You really feel every single one of them. The FFB gives great feedback. Especially the Virginia Raceway shows you how good the FFB really is. The tracks are just accurate and in many layouts. Also the brasilian tracks, known from Stockcar Extreme, are very well done.Another thing is the performance: I have a pretty old computer, just the minimum specs and it simply runs smooth at 50-60 FPS on high details and HDR.So, if you want a very strong Simracer, take AMS. There is high potential of great mods. Seen from the graphics point of view, it might be an old game engine, but it is great to see what they got out of it. So this is also a good one for older computers.Regarding Mods there are already a GT3 Mod and an LMS Mod avaiable at European Endurance Center.			"

												Difficult choice...2 years ago this game would have been a must have, but I feel like now it is just another racing sim. Nothing about this game is really bad but sadly nothing about it is really good either. It is just mediocre and (depending on what you want) there are better options out there.Good:- Runs well- A huge selection of unique and mostly unknown tracks with over 100 layouts- A lot of Formula 1 cars (old and new ones)- Pit stops- Day/Night cylce- Dynamic racing line & grip buildup- A huge amount of settings- Championship modeBad:- AI is mediocre and sometimes warps when you hit them to avoid contact (looks really weird)- Graphics are average at best- No weather- No VR support planned (must have feature for racing sims imo)- (Selection of cars and tracks doesn't appeal to me)- No F1 licenses so you'll have to use fake liveries or create your own- No laser scanned tracks- Menu is ugly and slowVerdict:Like I said, it isn't a bad game. But it isn't all that impressive either. If you don't mind the boring AI and like old F1 cars then I would recommend this game to you. To all other people I suggest you look at rFactor 2, iRacing or RaceRoom. Automobilsta is a solid sim but nothing to shout about. The devs are great people, you can trust them.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, after playing for 11 hours or so I feel I can give my early impression of the game.Reiza have done an amazing job with an ageing graphics engine, it looks pretty good, better than stock car extreme and rFactor 1 (who's engine it's based on).It runs at a high frame rate that you can limit in game, I have a 144hz refresh rate monitor so I limit it to that and it works well.It drives very nicely and is a lot of fun, with the right car.As it's from Reiza you get an awful lot of Brazilian tracks, which I'm not a huge fan of, prefering the classic European tracks, like Spa, Nurbergring, Hockenheim, Silverstone, etc.The good news is that there are already some fantastic free tracks that have been produced, that are up to the standard of the publisher. These tracks, by Patrick Giranthon and his team, are first rate and look fantastic.My only other gripe is that there are no GT3 cars, which are my favourites and far too many open wheelers, which I'm not keen on.Having said that the modders have been busy and there's already a WTCC BMW to be downloaded free, which is an excellent drive.If Reiza continue to update this game and release new content, and if the modders keep going I can see this game going from strength to strength.One final word, the online is clunky (it was the last time I played). If this gets sorted that will be another plus point!I received this game for free as I already owned Stock Car Extreme. It's so good I would have bought it if I hadn't been given it!8/10 (Will change to a 9 with more content and better multiplayer support) :)			"

												This is the most bad azz racing sim you've never heard of.  The AI behaviour is unlike anything I've ever experienced and I have nearly every racing game on the market.  Sometimes, I spend more time watching(and laughing) at the AI behaviour because it is like racing against humans.  The AI make the same mistakes as I do and jostle with each other on the track in such a way that it's almost creepy.  And they're not overly aggressive or ""stupid messy"".  Nobody has coded their AI like this studio.The physics model is amazing.  The only other sim I've found that is somewhat comparable is Assetto Corsa.  It's excellent.  The damage model is good and comparable to most racing sims.  Not crazy good like Dirt Rally, F1 2016 or Grid Autosport, but good.  The OVERALL physics model is not like Nascar Racing Season 2003, but what is?  Although, it's really good.   The FFB and control setup is great and very easy to adjust.  I use an ancient Logitech MOMO and it accepts it.The graphics are not Project Cars good, but hey?!, do you want to spend your time staring out into the grand stands, watch a raindrop dance across your windshield/visor or feel an excellent racing simulation?  That's what I thought...keep your eyes on the road and that AI behind you that's trying to eat your lunch with style.  An example of the detail given in little areas you wouldn't expect to see any is when you drive into grass or dirt, it sticks to your tires for a short period of time.  I've only seen that in F1 2016 and that's ""last week new"".  The cars are beautiful.The content is, well, excellent.  You want Stock Cars? OK got it.  Want F1? OK got that too.  Trucks? OK got that covered as well.  Stuff you don't typically see in other racing sims? OK its here. You won't get bored with the variety of cars and tracks provided. Mods!! I've been following this studio for years and they just keep getting better.  Just get it.  The devil is in the details.			"

												Not without its flaws but a step-up (in terms of physics and immersion) from the likes of the GT franchise.Pros:- no grinding for credits as all cars and tracks are available from the off- great handling- dynamic track conditions (including evolving racing lines)- dynamic tyres (including visible dirt pick-up)- nice sounding cars- decent range of cars/series to choose from (several eras of F1 cars through Super V8s and the Marcas series)- competitive AI, which also makes the odd error from time-to-time- growing Mod library- great service from the devs who take the time to listen to the opinions of the community and even integrate some of the suggestions- customisable DynHUD (using DynHUD editor)- probably the most authentic sim racing experience outside of iRacingCons:- somewhat tame AI (in terms of AI-on-AI action) means its usually a case of simply 'follow the leader'- lack of both an introductory 'training school' feature and a Career Mode- no hover tips for the menu options (some of which may not be self-explanatory to the non-hardcore sim racer)- lack of more popular tracks as stock content (such as Spa, Nordschleife, Zaandvoort, etc.)- a somewhat small (though growing) online multiplayer community- essentially, just a rehash of rFactor (although this does show how talented the devs are, given the game engine is about 15 years old)To get a feel of what Reiza can do, try their totally free offering (Copa Petrobras de Marcas) first. If this impresses you (as it did me) then you'll get along with AMS just fine. The lack of more popular tracks may put some off making the investment, but there are quite a few Modders out there who have added a decent amount of additional content, which is still growing thanks to some good work from dedicated (and generous) enthusiast-level fans of the game.In my opinion, AMS is a stepping stone to bigger things. It's enjoyable as a sim in its own right, no doubt, but it's more a precursor to what I see as being Reiza's main project, which I understand will get underway in 2017. This I look forward to very much. For now, though, AMS will do just fine.As a side note, it's probably worth getting the season pass (especially if you can get it at a discounted price) because there are quite a few more DLC packs on the horizon, all of which (so far at least) seem to me to be worth making the investment.

												Problably the best real simulator available for public, nothing in this game is meant to be easier than in reality, although we can use aids to get used first. It got from cars from the entry levels of motorsport to almost all eras of the pinnacle of racing, with plenty of fun tracks already in the game, and plenty of others created by modders, it as custom championships for offline and a very good netcode, maybe the best with iracing for online races. With amazing force feedback, detail physics, detail vehicles dynamics and true engineering representations of the real cars, this game can be used like a racing training weapon, since is used by some of the best racing driving centers in the world, like Adrenaline Control and professional racing teams. The only downside is not having dynamic weather, maybe in the future.. The team behind this project is basically some of the world's best in simulation physics, sound, 3d models and software engineering, and all together have created Automobilista.			"

								This really is one of the most enjoyable racing Sims I have ever played.  It's based of the rfactor engine but seems to do everything better than rfactor.  I like to play with a t150 wheel and a 360 pad when I can't be bothered to set my wheel up and I have to say the 360 pad settings and setup just wipe the floor with rf2.  It's easy to adjust and enjoy the game without insane understeer and oversteer and the dreadful swaying rf2 has with the 360 settings. Of course like any SIM the true beauty is with a good quality ffb wheel.  I highly recommend this game for any SIM racer, just be sure to follow the steam guides to adjust your gpu to make it look and run nice. Great game 10/10 nice job Reiza			"

I wish the game had production car racing. Other than that the game is wonderful. I love racing so I play it everyday. I'm a karter so I use that for training just to see how the cars handle and turn under different tweaks. So I would definately recommend the game to anyone who likes racing and even to most who dont like racing.			"

												I got this game for free since I have the Stock Car Extreme.In few words...- very solid plataform from rf1 engine with great enhancements in countless areas;- great variety of out of the box cars and tracks (road class) with outstanding quality;- great force feedback (ffb);- great community of mods;- DLCs to buy if you enjoy this game and want to try more, helping them to keep their work in the next title, hopefully in 2018 or who knows sooner;A good advice if you are a beginner in simracing:Be sure you properly configured your steering wheel range for each car do you want to drive. In my Logitech G25, I have to do a 3 steps procedure: (not sure about the other wheels). 1) go in the garage to check the wheel range options for the car.2) exit the session to the main menu of the game and setup my wheel range (in the game)3) load the session again and change in the garage the range you want to use.

												Just a great, fun game. Don't be fooled by the cartoony icons, the modeling is really fine. I give the modeling 8 of 10. Set up I give 9 of 10. Forced Feedback 10 of 10. Trackside modeling 9 of 10. Car types and models 9 of 10. A.I. 9 of 10. Playback, 9 of 10. Sound design 10 of 10. Great  crash distortion that affect handeling (adjustable) 10 of 10. Track modeling 10 of 10 (mostly Brazilian tracks with an American, British and an Argantinian track thrown in). It may not be a simulation addicts dream, but for sheer driving fun this is an outstanding game. I recomend.			"

								Reiza keeps going from strenth to strenth, Game stock car is very good, Automobilista is just awsome.An outstanding variety of cars and classes with Added Stadium Super Trucks and Lancer Rally X to go with the already great content from stockcar extreme. So what ever your flavor be it Karts, Super Karts, Mini Cup FVee, F3, F1 from 70s 80s 90s 2000s 2010s and today, Super Tourers , V8 Supercars and more ( and thats before the modders get started ) its Great.Dues to Licence F1 cars are generic but the Physics are great, Graphics are step forward.So for Gamers, modders and the like with rF experiance this will feel like home.There are a few little things to be sorted out, CTD issues and such but over all its one of the best Value for Money driving sims out there. And yes a wheel is best way to go but game pad does work so dont let that stop you.Automobilista is very easy to just jump in and play and enjoy but also has enough features for the die hard Sim racer.As a Early Access Game Reiza has shown how a EA game should be released. Not to mention thier generosity in giving to title to everyone who ownen GSC Prior to Jan for Free.Thankyou.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm a sucker for racing games, always have been and probably always will be. Since i moved from console gamng back in November 2015, I been looking for the true racing experience. Being a console man, racing always seemed too arcade like or as though id bought iceskating simulator. Forza 5 (ok console release title, still ♥♥♥♥) Project Cars failed completely with a broken game that i heard wasn't much better on PC, formula 1 2015, poo. Any way my cousin introduced me to two great racing sims on The PC, iracing and RFactor 2, both fantastic games, also introducing me to the new dirt game which was brilliant.After reading reviews about this game I thought why not, its not expensive, it dosn't need a subscription and its got amazing feedback. So i took the plunge.EARLY ACCESS!!!!!! Best early access I've ever played. It has more content then any console racing game thats been a finished title. The graphics are great, fps is smooth running 120 fps dead, no jutter, just what you want from a racing game. The Sound is fantastic, I've not driven many cars in the 6 hours I've clocked up so far but I have to say the mini cooper race was a blast. My G27 needed no config at all everything was set just perfect. the feedback really sychs with what im seeing on the screen. I have experienced one issue but its not anything major, but is still a problem non the less. If i have my xbox one elite plugged in for use of headset on skype, the game does not boot. Im assuming that its simply just conflicting what controller the game wants to use. The moment i unplug the xbox controller the game loads fine. This game is Just brilliant though. The AI can be adjusted for those that are inexperienced racers or the true vetran racers. The AI is the best I've ever experienced, but still useless when it comes to them getting back on the racing line. I've done three races in three different classes, all with rolling starts, the races have been great, but the auto start is annoying, you seem to lose momentum against the AI Due to the game changing to 3rd gear as you're given control. bring in a warm up lap to begin a rolling start then i would find this game completely perfect. Even without that slight change this game is a gem, and I recommend it to any kind of racer, be it rookie or hardcore this is a superb racing game. Also with a modding community and a lot of events that are set up daily, not taken part in anything myself but i have looked into it and aim to become a competitor in the future but i have some training to do.9.8/10 Cons: Minor controller glitch, which stops the game loading, easily fixed by removing xbox device. And race start.Pros: everything else. Fantastic job Devs Keep up the good work.			"

								First review i have ever left!I have played racing games since 'Grand Prix 1' with a joystick :D. This is BRILLIANT!!!I own/subscribe to iRacing, rfactor 2, Dirt, Project Cars (rubbish don't touch it) and more. My spare time is spent building my rig and racing. This is the game that finally really makes me feel like I am part of the car and can feel what is happening.Specs:i7 3770R9 290xAsus H61 mobo - it was free!8gb Balistix sport something or other @ 1600hz (limited to 1333mhz by mobo)22 inch Acer Monitor 1080P 60Hz - Cheap but just about sufferable for racing games. Great for everything else though.Samsung SSD 250gbWith sweetfx turned off and 8x-AA (adaptive multisample through Crimson), this game (sorry simulator) looks excellent. Very little flickering with this high AA and it looks sharp and crisp. Having played Project Cars that the graphics here really are better! This is because it is smooth. The textures from my view point are also superb! No strange flickering and very little stuttering. Exactly what you need when doing 150+mph.And its early access!!I didn't buy Stock Car Extreme, because I was put off by the comments about the graphics. Graphics certainly do not mean everything, but I do find, I need racing sims to be sharp and clear with no jaggered lines. I didn't enjoy the old rfactor engine either, graphically or physically. However it seems I under estimated what Reiza can do. If you had doubts. Don't have. Best £25 you will spend.I'd rather not have fancy rain droplets and amazing lighting that doesn't work, I'd rather have all the amazing content REIZA have packed into this, how well it is put together and how playable it is. Basic setups are more than driveable and a few tweaks is all it takes to improve your times and start to be able to push. Plenty of Formula cars, plenty of stock cars, TRUCKS, Go karts, rally cross, touring cars, v8's..................................... Oh and the tracks. Never heard of most of them but these need to be the new F1 calender. So much fun. Old style tracks with proper corners. And the modders are making some more well known tracks as well.And the sounds.....................................AWESOMEand the MODS.................................................AWESOME- Support.....................................AWESOME- Dev Interaction.....................................................AWESOME- Community..................................................Only been watching and reading for a week, but so far..........wait for it............how did you know...............AWESOMEIf this is what Reiza can do with a 10 year old engine, I cannot wait to see what they will come up with next year.There is so much more. But you should just click the 'add to cart' button and find out for yourself.Enjoy!!! "

And with the season pass there is a lot of new content to add to the already huge car and track selection. Give it a go and I promise you won't be disappointed.

Right now it is more of a sandbox than a proper racing sim; no actual storyline like Toca 2 or 3Hopes for DLC:-A package for a bunch more iconic tracks-A rally or raid series of cars-An exotic package of cars (Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, etc.)-Mabye a decrease in prices (one series of DLC cars is like, $6 or $7)Overall I would rate this 8/10			"

For people who don't race often online, the AI is second to none, the vehicle selection as boxed brilliant and as the modding community take it on the selection will only grow. I love that you can now put various classes of vehicle on track simultaneously (my favourite hobby on rFactor), on GSC Extreme trying to put various vehicle classes together created a lot of lag.

												Automobilista is the result of Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor having a baby.Physics:Automobilista has very realistic physics that resembles rFactor and iRacing. Although the force feedback is a bit rough, it is overshined by Automobilista's F1 and Racecar physics. In my opinion, AMS' best physics are in the karts and single-seaters. Automobilista has a different feel than other racing titles which means you will have to get used to it.Gameplay:The best part of automoblista's gameplay would be the online and hotlap modes, where the optimization and hard work is mostly spent. The AI in this game sadly is very poor and imo needs some work. For example if you are slower they will stay behind you until you fully get off the racing line and litterally get out of their sight before making a move, Which means having multiple car classes at once can be a probem in singleplayer.Graphics:The fun part of having an outdated graphics engine is that there is no lag. For people like me who have a poor system this can be a life-saver. Even if the engine is old, the game is suprsingly very nice looking on ultra and is about equivalent to the counter-parts iRacing and the rFactor series. If you are a real sim racer, graphics should not change the way you drive or see a game.Content:Sadly, the game crashes at this aspect. For the price, Automobilista should have double the variety of racing cars and most importantly, TRACKS. Although there are more than 12 tracks in-game, about half of them are mexican/brazilian tracks that the average sim-racer doesnt even know. Racing on Monza, Nurburgring, Spa or Paul Richard  is only acomplished with Mods.Even sader, the upcomming content will all be sold in DLC packs which are way over-priced imo.Overall:physics: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Content: 6/10Final Rate:     75% "

								As everyone else is saying: the ffb and physics on this game are THE NEXT LEVEL. Combined with the force feedback and handling of the cars is the sense of speed delivered in the way you're virtual head moves about inside the cockpit. I set the head motion and yaw exaggeration to the maximum, cranked up ""look ahead"" all the way, and it REALLY adds to the sense of g forces involved in cornering, accelerating and braking inside the cockpit as it feels like the car is violently bucking and surging, as it should in an F1 car.As far as graphics go I was about to delete the game from my system and go on a forum and ♥♥♥♥♥ about how crappy they are until I discovered that you have to DISABLE SweetFX in the initial setup screen of the game, keep Anti Aliasing OFF...and then go into the nvidia control panel and manually setup the Anti Aliasing there to OVERRIDE the game's settings. I bumped my Anti Aliasing up to 32 supersample and now the graphics are smooth as silk. If you just install the game as is with sweetFX enabled the graphics look a bit like playstation 1, so don't delete it from you system until you follow the above.Don't expect Assetto Corsa level graphics here but to me, it's all about the smoothness of the jaggies. The textures of the track are done quite nicely and are very detailed. The cars are modeled very well but there are a few bugs in some views, such as when looking to the rear while in the cockpit your back wheels won't be visible in the F1 car. But this is still pre launch so I'm sure it will get fixed. The terrain in general is a bit bland but on par. The thing I'm finding with the tracks is they are all a little bland just by their nature, but a blast to drive. So again, this sim isn't about showcasing eye candy, its about the EXPERIENCE, and in my opinion this is THE game for F1 hot lapping. I have not yet tried driving against the Ai so I can't speak about that, but my hunch is it will be intense. I've never had a game pull me so much into the feeling of driving an F1 car at high speed as this one. Just be sure to widen your field of view a bit back to get that sense of speed necessary.If you crave a pure F1 experience THIS is THE game.			"

												One Sentence: The essence of sim racing captured in one game.Longer review:First of all, its a sim, you need a wheel, not a controller and of course not a keyboard.Why do i call it the essence of sim racing? It has all the features you want in a sim: +SUPERB FORCE FEEDBACK only got to test it with a T500RS+Shifter but this was impressive, more or less plug and play and i consider it even a bit better then assetto corsa+BROAD VARIETY OF CAR CLASSES touring, stockcars, formula cars of different decades as well as training cars, prototypes, trucks and so on.Dont get me wrong, there are not that much types of different cars in each class, mainly one or two. But there are so many classes and they are incredible good emulated. The Formula classes are the best ive driven so far. Karting comes at least close to reality unlike every other game.+AMAZING SOUNDYou hear your car and all the parts of it (gearbox, suspension, tires, brakes) and it sounds raw at the best means of it. Very immersive, no vacuum cleaners.+DECENT AIStill worse than online but its fun to drive championships against them.On the other hand it leaves away everything you do not need in a sim:O MINIMALISTIC GRAPHICO NO ACTIONO NO TUTORIALSO NO PRESENTATIONDownsides are:- ONLY VERY FEW NON BRASILIAN TRACK- DID NOT TEST ONLINE YET BUT ITS SAID TO BE NOT THE BEST YET- UI COULD BE BETTER- NOT THAT MUCH MODS (there are some and they are good but nothing like ac or gtr2)- ONLY FEW REAL CARS (ok i get it, the licences are expensive and i want content not names, but somehow id like a BMW or Ferrari u know) All in all a 9/10 imho. This game reminded me of when i first played gtr2 like 3 years ago, my first sim. Immersive, hardcore realism, no explanation, just straight forward driving, the look. I think this is the game SimBin wishes they had made 5 years ago instead of Raceroom and Race 07. Finally a real opponent to Assetto Corsa. What about Project Cars you say?! Not even close! "

												Disclaimer: I got this game for free because I bought Stock Car Extreme before this game existed.One of the most enjoyable hardcore racing games to date. No online fees, Minmal DLC releases. Stock, V8 Super, and Go karts... F3, juniors, F1's, and many older ones to boot. The Classic F1 and 86 Opala Chevy I6 Stock Car being my favourite cars to run. The game uses an upgraded Rfactor engine with great physics and more livly graphics and textures. Clearity @High FPS and any resoloution is always awesome. The modeling is pretty great. If you can't play anyone online, then why not just get together with a friend and race the Ai Together, it works for me. This is so much better then all those other games that pass them selves off as simulation, such as Asetto Corsa, and Project DLC. All super cars, no soul.The server system finally works, the Hud is pretty good for such an old game engine, and the controls are solid, just make sure you spend enough time tuning the wheel outside and inside the game and make sure the steering feels just right.

												Lack of G29 / G920 Wheel Support (Got Perma Ban from reiza forums for reporting this Wheel Issue), yet they announced to integrate Proper G29 / G920 Wheel Support but this still didn't happened. Also AMS has Expensive DLC's for less new content and few hundred mods available which all got converted over from rFactor 1 to AMS whilst rFactor 1 has no Expensive DLC's and thousands of free mods available. Overall AMS is just a bad / poor rebranded copy with some graphics overhaul of the great unbeaten rFactor 1. Those are the main reasons why the main Online Part of AMS is death and also why people are still prefer rFactor 1 over AMS.			"

												Being a professional sim racer for years,after playing great titiles such as Gran Turismo,Rfactor and Assetto corsa,i've been thinking to own something new,well Automobilista is the asnwer for the new change.The graphics are better to that of rf2,physics are on a different level that you can't even compare with the best sims out there.Handling is quite okay...you need to increase the steering lock or else the car tends to be lazy at corners.There are many mods on Race Department.The problem in the game lies with AI,they don't perform well on mod tracks (not an issue at all).Well drawbacks of the game is...1.No green hell (Nurburgring)2.No rain/weather changes3.No big car brands4.Setting FFB is tricky5.Many control inputs& 6.Getting onto onlin racing and setting up a room is a very big processOverall,this game has been developed on rf1 engine and yet,the game is simply superb......Happy racing "

												I was going to delete my old review, but then thought it would actually be best to leave it up, because I don’t think my experience with this title is unique. In short, my initial impressions of the AMS were observationally correct, and yet simultaneously completely…utterly…wrong. You can read the original review below this one. After doing a little reading, I decided to reinstall the game and give it another go last week. This time, armed with a little pre-knowledge and a more realistic expectation of the setup curve, my experience was completely different. First, the force feedback. I own and play (PCars, AC, R3E, and rF2) and IMO, with a little bit of tweaking, AMS has arguably some of the best force feedback I’ve ever felt in a sim.  And by a little bit of tweaking, I mean simply adjusting one setting in the .ini file to dial out any clipping from the default settings. A small bit of clipping is perfectly okay, but the devs claim the defaults settings, allow about 20-30% clipping. Not sure what wheel they tested that on, but on my CSW-V2, the default gain setting for the cars in the base installation allows a little too much clipping in the high-speed corners for my tastes. Not a big deal, very easy to dial out. And once you do, the cars will feel amazing. :)Second, the graphics. This was a big turn off for me the first time I tried AMS. Yes, I realize graphics aren’t the end-all-be-all measure for sim titles, but, coupled with what I thought at the time was poor FFB and a poorly designed GUI, the outdated looking graphics made me feel as though it wasn’t worth the time to negotiate the setup curve of the title. What I didn’t realize at the time was, AMS’ built-in graphics processing is terrible, but you don’t have to use it. By turning off almost every in-game graphic setting, and simply creating a profile in my GPU driver for AMS, and allowing the GPU to handle most of the processing, I was able to use the enhanced HDR setting in AMS, and it looks like a totally different game—very much comparable to any other modern title. When properly configured through the GPU, the outdated graphics gripe basically becomes a complete non-issue. Third, the GUI. Yes, it appears a bit cluttered and hard to navigate, but the more time I spend with the title, the more I seem to be discovering the method behind the madness. AMS remembers the little things, like which track you were driving in each particular car and what difficulty level you were using with that particular car/track combo. The latter was a welcome surprise, considering AI difficulty often varies by car/track combo. I believe some of these little conveniences that have been revealing themselves are made possible, in part, if not completely, by the way things are broken down and organized in the GUI. And, to be honest, after a few days of play, the GUI doesn’t seem nearly as chaotic as it did on day-one. :)So, as much as I’d like to say, “Please ignore my previous review.” I think reading them both is best, because there’s a good chance you’re going to be feeling some, if not all, of the things I felt about the game when I first tried it a few months ago. The thing to remember is, while all my past observations were indeed true, they only apply to the out-of-the box installation. With a little patience—a browse through the community forum and possibly a Google search or two—the initial installation can be transformed into a real racing pleasure that should appeal to just about any sim fan. Verdict: AMS is a definite must have for sim fans. Below is my original review. :o--------------------------------------------I heard a lot about this game and was excited about the track evolution aspect. After downloading it, and selecting the No Assist option, I then spent about 20 minutes trying to find out why it was still auto upshifting for me. After a Google search, I discovered that selecting manual wasn't enough (WTH??). There was a second setting for upshifting. Whatever, I moved on and started tackling the FFB. It felt promising, but when I went to start dialing it in, I realized there was no FFB meter (again... WTH?). I found a lot of information online, telling me to make manually adjustments in the config .ini files. That seemed a little archaic, and coupled with the lack of an FFB meter, I was just really turned off at this point. To make matters worse, the graphics are very, VERY dated looking, compared to just about any racing game made within the past 7 years. I have a GTX 1080 and had the settings cranked, viewing it on a 4K screen. It still looked dated. Even the onscreen HUD overlays looked like they were made for a kid's game. At the 1.5 hour mark, I just gave up an returned it. If I didn't already have three sims that I was thoroughly enjoying, I might have spent more time trying to massage AMS into shape. But there just seemed to be too much blind fiddling required. Verdict: Refunded.			"

								Automobilista and Reiza Studios have now set the benchmark for simracing genre and more importantly for developers, and they set it very high. This is a game and a team to get behind. Unlike so many others out there. If you are familiar with Stock Car Extreme, then you know this is the natural evolution/ big update of that title. It is everything SCE turned up to 11, and if you owned SCE prior to Jan 5/16 you got this update for free! AMS does so many things so well:-	If you are a Formula One fan you got cars & tracks both modern & historic that span back 40 years-	If you are a stock car fan you got a global selection of the Brazilian & Australian V8 spanning back 40 years-	Touring cars…check-	Karts…check-	Super trucks…check-	Rally cross..check-	Day & Night racing…check-	Best AI in the business…check-	Beautiful & optimized graphics…check-	Accurate &  impressive sounds…check-	Evolving track conditions…check-	Incredible tire & physics model…check-	Fantastic and natural FFB…check-	Interesting, unique, and new tracks..check-	Reasonable & fair price…check-	And on and on and on… As simracers, we are now spoiled for choice, and if you own or have looked at any of the big titles out there this is the one that goes straight to the top of that list.Do I recommend this game? YES10/10PS: I have over 50 hours in the Beta version, please ignore my low count here.			"

								Since I first heard mention of this game, I was extremely excited for it. My high expectations were met almost flawlessly. There is a HUGE variety of racing disciplines in Automobilista. Anything from go karts, to F1 cars of almost every generation. rallycross, Stadium Super Trucks, and almost anything else you can think of. There's even a class of stock street car camaros. The content heavy rich sim is met with very realistic physics and handling models. For buying this so close to launch and with it being considered ""early access"" I could not be happier. 10/10			"

								OUTSTANDING force feedback. Out of the box better than any other game. Project cars looks pretty but Force feedback is awful without heavy modding. Assetto Corsa is an excellent game which just doesn't quite feel right sometimes, almost like the cars are too difficult to drive (and I love a good challenge) Stock car extreme was excellent and had the best feeling up until now. They have significantly improved in nearly all areas over GSCE. This runs at 4k with unlimited cars on track on max and looks great if you cans upport this. Yeah it would be nice to have a few more known tracks but if you mod your games and are members of decent modding groups etc there is plenty of content and it's ever increasing. Sure other games look better and they have more tracks that you know but they don't have great a.i or feel like you're actually racing a real car. Closest you can come to that in my opinion. REIZA love your work!			"

								What a great simulation !!!I played GameStockCar for several years, and it is a great simulation. And this one is the same, but with improvements in all areas : graphics, sounds, physics, FFB.... Reiza is really the best regarding driving sensations, and i am sure that they will do like GSC, with lots of updates and content to come in the future. I have never had a so real and great feedback on the wheel like on this AMS. And their policy with they community and customers is great. They really deserve to have success with their great simulation.If you love driving, tracks, engines, sensations and realism, this is the best you can have !!			"

												ok i dont understand how this game has such a small fan base. if you like/love driving simulation than this game is for you...there are so many diffrent cars ,go carts ,f1,indy,v8 supercar ,toca,trophy trucks ,trucks ,rally cars each car feels so realistic to drive lets get behind this game so they put more high end tracks in one of the best sims iv played and iv got pretty much all of them!!! 11/10 for fun and realistic handling!!! trophy trucks are so fun enter the corner doing the right speed turn in and give it a stab on the gas and watch the front wheel lift be gentle or roll roll roll hahaha!!! keep up the good work devs love your work there is a review that says :  I must say it is much inferior in graphics and realism to Assetto Corsa... must be using a xbox control or dosnt know how to set up his wheel lolas i was saying : I have no idea what the good reviews are about...Controller layout is ♥♥♥♥, Its is the analogs to drive rather then triggers..There is no campaign or storyline just single races, multiplayer is dead and when you do join the game removes you from it...Unless you have a steering wheel and pedal set up and what to race single races DO NOT BUY this game..yes There is no campaign its just a pure drivingsim like flightsim.P.s im going to bring my xbox control to the race track...

								Well I thought this would be disappointing with only DX9. How wrong can you be!!!The FFB is just great and so easy to get right on my G25!! A quick read of the manual (even the bit of the manual that exists now is excellent!!) and an hour of testing and FFB is set.Graphics tweaked, thanks again to the manual for showing me how to setup my NVIDIA card settings with the inspector. I am running ULTRA and top settings everywhere and still get 90fps (capped) in practice and a pretty respectable framerate on replay on my gtx960.I added Bathurst and SPA from Race Department site so in addition to the vast amount of provided cars and tracks more can be added. The driving ""feel"" is definitely the best for me and I have AC, PCars, R3E, Dirt Rally, F13, iRacing. Even the AI seems good although I haven't used it much yet.Congratulations.			"

								Most would know this game is based on the ISI RFactor2 engine.  Reiza have improved the experience vs RFactor2.  The FFB is the best in the market, RF2 second and iRacing third.   Well worth getting just for the FFB alone - terrific driving experience.  For hard core throttle over-drive, trail braking, etc, iRacing is still the best.  But for a more fun experience and a great intro to car sim racing you could do a lot worse than Automobilista.  Highly recommended.			"

												I thoroughly enjoy this game.  A real improvement over the 10 other racing games in my library.  With the addition of the C7 MOD and the WTCC MOD from Race department and the Track Pack it gets more of my time than rFactor 1.  With the addition of some of the rFactor N. American tracks it would be the game for me.  The changes to the Boxer made it more fun to drive.  One Con is the inability to change gearing in some cars that do not allow them to work on faster tracks.  I run offline and like to try all cars on all tracks.Thanks and 2 thumbs up to all the developers that contributed to this game.			"

								Automobilista is the successor/upgrade to the underrated but great Game Stock Car Extreme. With it you get more content (all made to Reiza's great standards), a better menu than its predecessor, and new features to the ISI engine like track rubbering (in early stages) and tyre flatspotting!Sure, there is the problem of visuals, which are getting outdated (although I think Reiza did a good job keeping them visually appealing), and there are several limitations that the engine gives us, especially concerning settings and in-game customizability. Gladly, this can mostly be fixed with mods, which Automobilista is as open to receiving as any other good ISImotor sim!I would say, if you have a wheel and are looking for a good sim with a large variety of cars, especially open-wheelers, give Automobilista a shot.

												Don't often write recommendations but this is one of those times. Going to write it in order of 'Pros', 'Average', 'Cons'.PROS:-Physics are absolutely on point. (Cars like the V8 Super cars, Go-Karts, touring cars and F3), The levels of grip given to each wheel at certain times, and the way the car 'dances', like it should in lots of cases, it's completely unmatched by any other sim . EG, taking a corner, and the FR wheel hits a bump, you don't just feel it amazingly well in the FFB, the cars weight shifts extremely well, creating more lean on the LF tyre, the suspension then reacts to it, changing grip levels of both those tyres and the movement of the car. The list goes on and on about the reactions of the cars in different curcumstances.  You can also feel the effects of the downforce much more through the FFB and car control. Take the Formula 3, at high speed the car is much more planted, but at lower speed the wheel requires far more steering input as the downforce becomes almost non-existant and you are rellying on mechanical grip. Also, the suspension physics are immaculate, low speed reactions to bumps and kurbs is great. -Force Feed Back, Simply unmatched. No other sim is even close, 'Nuff said really. -Management... Yes, you have to manage tyre and brake temps. If you have the HUD on, you can see your brake and tyre temps in detail. Don't keep your tyres and brake temperatures up, they become less effective. -Car list, is fairly vast.... Go-Karts/X-cross/V8 Super cars/trucks/F3 etc etc Average:-Now one thing that got hyped, and rightly so, was the AI. The AI is great, far better than other titles I've played in Sim's. You can change their aggression, and skill level in percentage right up to %120. They'll do pretty well to hold their own on the track. But, and it's a big but, They also still hold big features that make you strongly remember they are AI. For example, AI does not have a clue what a blue flag is.... Imagine, you get out first in quallifying, get the tyres and brakes up to temp on that outlap, then full steam ahead down the Start/finish to start your flying lap. Just to be met with %50 of the AI coming out of the pitlane, and that don't react to blue flags.... It's such a simple thing that destroys the element of the AI supposedly being 'human'. Also when you change their aggression to 'extreme', they still are very cautious about passing you and defending. I lost my wing in F3, and completely removed myself from the racing line and slowed down to around 50mph, and moved right to the edge of the track, and there was still a queue of AI behind deciding on whether it's safe to pass me or not. Also, they don't defend as aggresive as this setting suggests, they often leave the door wide open. But the plus side in that is that they do try to counter attack..... Another note with the difficulty level, is it's too easy in some cases. I had the super Karts at Spielburg (I know I spelled that wrong), and I naturally have the dificulty set to %110. Within 17 minutes practice I was the quickest driver on track by .4 of a second... I reset the difficulty to %120, and within 45 minutes practice I was still the qiuckest driver by .3 of a second.  It should be a tad more difficult imo. 45 minutes practice, without ever driving that vehicle, should have me at the back of the pack somewhere...... BUT, In general race-craft, the AI is a huge improvement, and is actually fun and difficult to race against for the most part. CONS:-Graphics, it's not a huge dissapointment, but at some points it does feel very outdated. I'm running Maximum detail and it doesn't look right. I'm seeing jagged lines with Full detail and 16x AA. I feel i'm mising something, and the opponents cars give that old school floaty and pixelated look at 50+ meters. Maybe that's something at my end, but it's a bit of a turn off. Doesn't reflect the fun you have while driving though that's for sure. -Setting up the wheel. Now this is only if you are a perfectionist, like me. You may find yourself going back and forth changing the settings, but if you aren't new to sims and Race in the likes of iRacing, you may be more used to it. But it does seem to take a bit more effort. The con is only the time it takes, but it definitely returns reward when you dial the settings in. -Multiplayer. The public servers are a ghost town, everybody who has this Sim, and races online, races in a league no doubt. -Mods, I went searching for them on RaceDepartment. And there wasn't a huge amount. A lot of the tracks were made by 'Patrick', or something. And there are barely any quality tracks, the only quality tracks existing were the ones made by this 'Patrick'. One Gentleman said that this is down to the Devs not releasing info on the game to support modders making tracks, specifically the shaders. I don't know how much truth is in this, but it does go as a con in my book if it is truthful. Overall, if you're a heavy sim-enthusiast get it, just buy it. You are missing out on something amazing. But you should really look to get into a online league, because the Public MP servers are dead. Also, a league is just normally far more fun anyway than the public lobby bangers.			"

												There are driving games, and then there is Automobilista. Amazing game, yes the graphics leave a lot to be desired but when you are going around a corner at the cars limit with another car to the right of you, you really don't give 2 hoots at how pretty the scenery is. Word of warning tho, and i hate to be that guy but if you plan on trying this game with a controller it is borderline unplayable, even with all the sensitivity stuff dialled down. There are 'better' controller friendly racing sims out there however you are missing out on some of the things this game offers like weather that actually has an effect on how your car handles, track progression where the racing line gets stickier as the race goes on due to the rubber getting laid on the track, hell even a safety car gets deployed in some races if some major incident goes down.Long story if you have a racing wheel and like driving games with a fair amount of realism definitely give this a try, even with steams 2 hour refund policy its worth a shot even if you have a controller as 2 hours is plenty of time to mess about with basic settings to see if you can get it to work for you with a controller. I know some people get on with using a controller in this game just fine, me personally i struggle with a controller which takes the enjoyment out of it but when the wife is in work, out comes the wheel and i have a blast.

								For those on the fence because Automobilista uses what some describe as a dated physics and graphics engine, the answer is that does not matter at all. The team at Reiza UNDERSTAND what it takes to make a satisfying sim, and no amount of slick graphics (Project Cars) substitute for engaging driving and gameplay. Let's take the setup of the cars and the physics:Reiza has refined and tweaked the ISI engine so that almost every car available gives wonderful feedback to the driver. You can feel when you are on the edge, and this is down to not only the beautifully tweaked physics but very importantly the customisable sounds including tyres and various balance controls enables you to get a very good idea of how fast you can push. Every clue that you need, both in sound and feedback, is customisable and exceedingly well done, including rumble strips, grass and dirt, and for me this is the only sim which offers believable reactions to being offline or offtrack. It also makes it much easier than other sims to catch a slide because you can feel what is happening to the back end of the car.Frankly I do not care whether the graphics are not to PCars ""standard"". Most of those are in any case a distraction from the job in hand: racing. The cars are very well done and despite not being fleshed out with bling like PCars are still perfectly good and crucially are way ahead in practical driving terms.The force feedback is (again unlike Project Cars with its frankly ludicrously complex FF setup - which doesn't have any clear explanations as to what the absurd number of parameters mean) simple yet highly effective.The AI in Automobilista is outstanding and superior to ANY currently available racing sim, yet Reiza are still working to refine it. This makes it by far the most satisfying offline racing experience.The one slight misgiving is the available tracks. It's not because they are mostly Brazilian circuits or somewhat unfamiliar, but that many of them are rather plain looking and consist often of very wide tracks with long, shallow or sweeping curves. Some make like these but I find them a bit samey and lacking in character. However I think Reiza Studios recognise this and are encouraging third party circuits and perhaps in the future will offer some classic tracks.Overall this is a very promising sim and despite being early access is already close to being a very polished product. Even at this stage it is far more polished and playable than either PCars or Assetto. It is also far more polished and offers much better quality content than ISI whose own content in rfactor 2 is falling way behind.			"

Other sims might do some individual things better, but overall, only iRacing beats AMS in my opinion, and you'd have to spend way more money. It's a shame the multiplayer isn't more popular, but the leagues are good, and racing against the AI is, I think, the best of any comparable sim. This started off as a few people making a mod for rFactor, how have they done so incredibly well?! I might have been a bit miffed at the cost if I hadn't recieved AMS for free after owning GSCE, but I shall be buying a season pass, these people deserve to be supported!			"

												All of the content is high quality both in terms of sound and physics. The ai are good enough if you're looking for this to be a singleplayer game. Multiplayer for now basically requires you to be in a league but you won't struggle to find one. Ultimately it's a complete package, and while it doesn't have a long string of buzzwords listing technologies and systems that result in the level of simulation present, playing it reveals you don't really need that.

												Great game, with a great dev. Been playing the game ever since it was first available in beta, and the last few updates (mostly Imola-dlc) has made me go from playing once a week to once a day. Dev is also great at listening at the community and talk with it at their forums. The game is a sim. so if you like racing games like Need for Speed because of the cool cars and trolling the police, this game might not be for you. But if you enjoy pure driving, with a steering wheel and pedals, and love racing both online and offline, this may be the perfect game for you.			"

												Maybe the best Racing experience I've had from a game.The cars seem so solid and the physics are terrific.The door to door racing is thrilling and the AI is great.Graphically it looks great on my 970m SLI laptop.It maybe be a last gen graphics engine used, but it's polished and smooth, uncluttered and clear.I sometimes feel latest gen graphics can be just too cluttered - the devs try to showcase the graphics engine by carmming too many things and effects on to the screen, I think they need to calm down a bit and realise that smoothness and clarity go a long way. The trick is to add the extra detail but keep the smoothness and clarity while doing so, otherwise don't bother.The 'Brit Pack' content is super, the tracks look and play fantastically.My only gripe is that the game is not very polished outside of the racing.For example on some tracks I can't start my car during practice, and on all tracks, after the race, I go into the pits, but the race won't end - I have to quit out of the race by pressing escape.The game sometimes crashes on launch also.So, a super racer - maybe the best you can get, I just wish the game outside of the actual racing was more polished and fluid.Useful graphics settings for people with SLI:

								If Reiza keeps its improvement curve, possibly the successor of Rfactor2. Great physics and good force feedback. Again, for serious racers as this is a simulator, not an arcade game.Mods work perfectly here. In order to beat Asseto Corsa beautiful graphics, Reiza just needs to improve it moving from directx9  to higher versions. And we will have the best simulator available.			"

												I am not real sure about all of the positive reviews on this. This is the first game I have asked for a refund with Steam. I only tried it for about an hour and concentrated on just a couple of cars but I did try a few of them and am not getting the same feeling for this title most others have. To me the FF feels very disconnected and not part of the simulated car at all. I do not get this feeling with other sims I drive. I also get that ""driving on ice"" feeling. I guess this title is just not for me and my system.			"

Early Access Review
								After reading and watching some reviews and getting the sense this was a well put together 'update' to rFactor 1, with some cars that I've wanted to try (Retro Formula/V10/V12 to name a few) I thought I'd take the plunge. I currently enjoy R3E, AC, and Project Cars, and have found the experience with Automobilista lacking in pretty much every way so far. The much touted FB on the G27 is hardly ground breaking, and the graphics are only just a step up from rFactor 1. There are bugs in the program that result in the Config Tool crashing (which Reiza has acknowledged and a fix is apparently in the works), and the starts are a mixed bag of being suddenly swerving around as the game gives control to you, or a formation lap where the car doesn't actually go anywhere and won't respond to the controls.I realize this is an early access release, and I'm hoping that Reiza and their team can improve on things to clean it up, but if you watch OnWheelsTV videos on YouTube and get the sense that this is the next big thing in graphics, FFB, and car physics...well...so far it isn't. Of the 4 main titles that I run regularly, this is a solid forth in all of those categories.			"

												First refund I've ever asked on Steam, guess it had to happen..?Played rFactor in the past so I expected this to be somewhat on par with it... Not only it took me 20 minutes to set up deadzones and stuff, but when I finally did, sensitivity was still too high at 5%.Then, it lags and stutters on a GTX960 whereas rFactor could run at like 120 fps...On top of this, extremely disappointed by the simulation as well, it's really weird and can be both very arcade-ish (kurbs, for example) and really complicated at the same time (tried those lovely Brazilian trucks and kept either flipping or spinning).Honestly have no clues how this game has such positive reviews...Finally, kindly don't call me a noob at racing games, I played Forza Motorsport at top levels, currently 1st on Ride 2, playing Dirt 3 at very high levels and so on. So please, I know what I am saying, thank you.Feel free to downvote this, fanboy kids.			"

												I bought this game and DLC  bundle because of all the positive reviews.  I have an AMD 8350 cpu , 2 GTX 970 in SLI and a T300 wheel and pedals.  The game crashes on loading and caused damage to my wheel like it was getting too much voltage or input.  The wheel was stiff and would not turn.  I tried many settings and it still wouldn't work in the game no matter what i tried.    After I uninstalled the game, I found out it actually caused damage to the T300 wheel.  I had to reload the drivers and reboot the computer several times.  I guess I may be the only person with this problem,   I suppose if this review gets deleted, then I will know why it has almost 100% positive reviews.....lol.    All the other racing games I have, Assetto Corsa, PC, Dirt, ATS, and many more, work great.  I was really hoping to try this game because it looks cool, but i am sure Reiza Studios won't replace any damage that is done to your computer or T300 from using their software....Hopefully this was just a rare case.

								I'm sure I'll like this game... once it's finished. Let's say it this way: it has all the good things Stock Car 2013 had, like a very good ffb, which is what you are looking for when you play simulation racing games with a wheel. This by itself would be enough to buy the game.However, there are cons too: graphics outdated if compared to Project Cars or Assetto Corsa (not a big issue though), few cars and tracks (you'll miss to drive a BMW or a Mercedes in Spa Francochamps or Nordschleife). Multiplayer is not available from the in-game menus, rotation degrees are broken in Thrustmaster T300 (always 270°, no matter what you do), the game crashes randomly, etc.Yeah, this is well called ""early access"", so, don't buy it in the current state. Wait until it's finished, when it will be almost surely a fantastic game.			"

								Going from GCS into AMS hasn't really changed much for me to recommend this one.  Probably the biggest ""problem"" for me is the content, yes for some this is great and fresh content, but for me personalyl I only like 2 cars in this game, V8 supercar and Mini Cooper, which isn't a lot. If you then put that onto mostly unknown tracks, then it's hard to convince someone like me to buy into thisengine - while improved - it's still showing it's age, and I had issue where resolution would be resetting back to default , no antialias and so on ( yes, it's early access and things will hopefully still improve ) so as it stands at this point, I would NOT recommend this over competing titles, such as Assetto Corsa or projctCARSsome praise AMS physics , I personally don't agree becase on gamepad - which is in my oppinion the only FAIR comparison of physics, becasue you are not affected what the FFB is telling you - it felt too planted, too grippy, not ""detailed"" it's cheap and it has fresh content, if that's what you're looking for, it might be great for youbut if you are looking for something that feels and looks good, then I think AMS is not for you			"

They tried to make it look tech savy but gave little in the way of thought to it. yes i had a wheel set up ... but for the keyboard warriors out there who in their right mind puts accel/brake as the ""A-Z"" keys and steering as the ""comma / full stop keys""Yes .3 hrs doesnt take long to recognise a bad game.... just doesnt make the cut , sorry fan boys.

								Menu system outdated, confusing and misleading. Poor graphics. Simulation accuracy is not the only thing that makes a game. Assetto Corsa is far superior in avery way.			"

												This game is one of the best racing simulators on the market. But to fully enjoy you really need a steering wheel. Then you can appreciate the physics and different car handling. The sounds are really great too, especially in formula cars, when you can hear the sound of the air passing the car in high speed. I also like the graphics. I know it's not the best compared to Assetto Corsa or Project Cars but for me the most important is actually the racing itself. The tracks looks very good for me, much better then in rFactor2 where they are using  very dull colours for some reason. Also the AI is much better here compared with the other racing games. Here you can see for example more often when AI drivers make mistakes (like in real life) which I didn't see in many other racing games. The downside of Automobilista is lack of dynamic weather. There is a 24h cycle but that's it. No wet racing :-( That's the biggest criticism. I also have noticed some AI issues, for example the AI drivers are for some reason much slower on corners, but on the straight line much quicker.			"

												Absolute garbage, dont understand all the positve reviews on here. Been on Pcars for a long time now and after seeing reviews on here thought it would be good to have a bit of a change. Only upsides I saw were ease of setup and ffb on the wheel. Graphics crap, handling crap and mp terrible. Refund on the way.			"

								crap game,graphics are bad,racing is bad,steering wheel not supported,driving physics very bad,car spins out on corners no matter how slow you drive,even braking is bad,very frustrating game to play.Anybody giving score of more than 2 out of 10 must be being paid to do so,Total waste of money.

								Control config continues to fail annoyingly after several attempts so controls don't work, such as loss of shift up or shift down or accel changes gear to neutral as well as accel? Seeking a refund on this.Well I persevered with AMS and have to say I'm glad that I did. Since those problems mentioned above disappeared some time ago I've very very much enjoyed using this sim for racing and I would absolutely recommend it now for the quality simulation it provides.

												I advice neutral, but the button doesn't exist+ Great physics+ Great FFB+ No crawling textures and no interfering in the textures+ Great content (still people use a lot of mods?)+ Fun driving+ Day-Night cycle during racing+ Leaderboards+ Good Forum (The forum has most of the time more activity then the online races, so it must be an important part of the game :)  )- No Ghostcar- To few people playing online (and half of them is in locked servers or are playing mods)- To much leaque racing, no fun for lone-riders- Modable, Mod cars polute the ""Real"" content by using their slots and make the change you can race online to more then 1 or 2 players smaller, I don't need this extra ""content""- AI is predictable, almost every track has a slow corner for overtaking the AI- AI drives in a parade, they don't race eachother.- You must have a twitter account to vote for the ""Time Trial of the Week""It is a great experience driving the cars in AMS on the AMS tracks,But it is a shame they don't fix the game and keep on Making extra content.Not a game for single players !! Perhaps it is a yes if you are a league racertheGame still feel like a Alpha releaseStill no sign of fixing the problems with the timing :(Don't buy this if you're looking for a gameBuy this if you are a league racer or if you are a Reiza-Fan			"

								Automobilista is a pure racing sim and may not appeal to the ""casual racing gamer"" who has no racing wheel (which is not meant to be a bad thing at all). The sim is adressed to peaple with a FFB wheel and pedals which want to race cars at the limit.Contantwise, the game has its focus at the brasilian Stockcar series and features all of the series tracks. This means, the tracks are mostly unknown brasilian tracks, but there are also some very good internatioal tracks like Suzuka and Montreal. Besides the Stock cars, there is a large variety of racing cars like Formula One inspired (modern and historic), tintops and karts. The cars feel really good - some of the best FFB out there. The cars are challanging but predictable to drive, which offers a good challange.The AI is solid and fair. After rF2 propably the best.A great racing sim which offers out of the box the best experience in my opinion!			"

												I like this game. The graphics are decent and the actual racing ( which matters in a racing game) is not bad. There are quite a bit of cars and tracks that come with the vanilla game and the dlc is not priced that crazy.  I hear that wheel support is iffy but who cares, I race with a controller.			"

												Initial impressions: We are really lucky nowadays because there are so many amazing sim racing games around. I really like Automobilista because it is a bit different than the rest of the crowd. To get it out if the way, graphics ain't that great but this game is mainly focused on physics,  FFB, & sound and they could not be any better. As some already know, AMS is based on Rfactor2 but everything is updated. Some of the mysterious tracks some might love or hate but there is a mega track pack on Race department that has all the usual known tracks (23 tracks). Bought the game and season pass while they were on sale for 37€. Yeah it is worth it guys give it a try and you won't be disappointed. Later			"

												Have most of ""the racing sims"" and a full motion sim rig, I'm blown away with this and have fallen in love with its ability to get to the real issue of car racing! The FFB and even more the sound is what's it really is like to race around a track in a race car. The mods you can add, tracks and cars are second to none and the Dev's support is what makes this sim brilliant. *****5 starsP.S. Can't wait for the upgrade coming soon....😎			"

												My favorite racing sim hands down. Love it so much I bought it twice! I'm so happy to see Reiza Studios come so far from the days of Game Stock Car 2012. There's just so much to praise about this sim.+The sounds are great (though not Race Room Racing Experience good but still very excellent).+The car physics are well weighted so that every turn you make feels rights.+The force feedback is beautifully detailed so you feel every bump and slip the car makes. +The car selections are so incredibly varied that you can go from Karts to V10 Formula 1 and drive a Mini Cooper when you want a more managable vehicle. It's also the only sim with Stadium Super Trucks! STADIUM SUPER TRUCKS! Come on, what's not to love about that!? (Though they are quite tricky to drive at first, I suggest checking YouTube for assistance)+The track selection is also wonderfully varied and incredibly detailed. Lots of South American tracks that I had never heard of before and now can't get enough of with more European and American tracks to come!+The A.I., though not up to par with rFactor 2, is still a great challenge and competes well if not better than other racing sims.+The graphics are somewhat dated, however, if you follow the instructions in the manual to set up additional graphic settings, it'll be quite gorgeous.If you're looking for a recent, complete sim-racing package, look no further. This sim is easy to love once you've delved many hours into it.			"

												Love playing racing games but spend more time trying to get the car handling to feel right, rather than racing. This is the game for you. Out the box, best FFB on the market. I own pretty much every racing sim there is and havent played any of them since I got Automobolista. If you consider yourself a sim racer and havent tried this game, time to sell your wheel.			"
