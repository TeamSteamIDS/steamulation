												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a indie horror game.Your daughter is assigned to an asylum because of attempting suicide. Somehow she has gone missing and it is up to you to find her.At the beginning you can choose if you play as the father or the mother (no difference to game, just difference voices).Soon after the start you will realize that The Hat Man is nothing more as another Slender clone. You move through the rooms and try to find all pages (notes from your daughter) while the Hat Man is trying to chase you.The Hat Man is fairly slow and not a real danger at all. You can easily walk through the rooms and collect the pages. To finish the game it takes something around 30 minutes.The graphics are not great at all. The whole game is very repetitive, all rooms look the same.The sound is okay but the voice acting is really awful.The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is not scary at all and especially not worth 4,99€ (former price was 14,99€).Sounds 3/10Graphics 3/10Gameplay 2/10Atmosphere 2/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

			My review of ""The Hat Man: Shadow Ward"", a first-person survival horror game set in an asylum developed and published by Game Mechanics.		

Game: The Hat Man: Shadow WardGenre: Survival horrorDeveloper: Game MechanicsPublisher: Game MechanicsCopy supplied by developerThe Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a first-person survival horror game set in an asylum developed and published by Game Mechanics.STORYYou play as either the father or mother of Virginia Berry, who disappeared from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. As you go and investigate her disappearance, you find no one in the asylum and you start looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being chased by a shadowy figure.Unlike most horror games of this nature, reading the notes and discovering what your daughter was living through is more interesting than simply looking at doodles and drawings of the monster. Unfortunately, the plot really goes nowhere and is disposable at best for the game.GRAPHICSAs far as Unity games go, this doesn't stand out from the crowd. The environments are polished and I didn't encounter a single bug, but the rooms all look the same and it becomes really hard to navigate the environment. The design of the titular villain and the shadow people isn't really scary, and once you see them the built-up scariness disappears.GAMEPLAYSimilarly to Slenderman: The Eight Pages, you must move through the environment looking for pages while avoiding being caught by the Hat Man. You will also need to find some objects to open new areas and further explore the asylum. The pages are really easy to find since they make a noise when you are near them, and the shadow people can be ""defeated"" by hitting'em with your flashlight ""Alan Wake style"".CHALLENGEThe game is really easy to beat, and the antagonist showed up rarely and was really slow and easy to avoid.SOUNDThe voice acting for both the father and mother is hilariously bad, and that alone is worth playing the game. There is only one piece of music, and is the relaxing one that plays at the radio. There are also some ambient noises, and luckily no screamers or loud jumpscares.REPLAYABILITYAfter having beaten the game, you can replay it to unlock the 11 achievements that require you to beat the game as fast as possible and find and listen to all the diary pages.The game is creepy most of the times, but the boring level design, poorly developed ghosts and short length make the game feel more boring than it needed to be. However, I recommend this game for the voice acting and really cheap price to support the developers to create a better product.Story: 6Graphics: 7Gameplay: 5Challenge: 3Sound: 5Replayability: 4ENJOYMENT: 6FRUSTRATION: 3Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group "

												Holy crap, is this ever terrifying. From the moment you step into a generically rendered asylum following the trail of a missing whats-her-name, it's just a non-stop thrill ride of collecting journal pages scattered randomly around the repetative environment as though by some drunken anti-literate. You move from recycled room to recycled room with only your trusty, predictable, yet totally unnecessary flashlight to light the way, as the masterfully executed tension mounts until you are randomly accosted by a terrifying, low-res shadow something-or-other and accompanying generic shrieky noise.As your sanity ebbs away, you notice it's wearing a hat. A horrifying black screen mournfully informs you that ""he has captured your soul"" before you exit out of the game and uninstall forever. Truly, the fear may dig deep but the memories last forever.			"

""THE SCARIEST GAME OF 2014""Oh boy, what a lie. This is exactly game for most of Youtubers and for little kids. Zero creativity, and besides that everything else is just stupid and repetetive like both above - Youtubers and 13 year old kids that think they are the face that runs the place. Enough of negativity right now and let's head back to the game. You have 3 options which will cost you same amount:A - 0,99€ - The Hat Man: Shadow WardB - 0,99€ - Nice tasty ham & cheese sandwich from gas stationC - 0,99€ - Year salary and work opportunity at magical place called ""Steam Quality Control Agency""Pick the A, B or C and leave it in comments down bellow. (Game itself is suppose to be generated and it is, but it works on repetetive basis so after few minutes you can clearly expect what will happen. Game is certainly not scary at all. There will be 2 joys out of all gaming experience - cheap trading cards set and 11 easy achievements so you can decide if it is worth. Expect nothing else out of it.)Bonus Point: Bologna SandwichRating: 2/10 "

												One of the first items you get in the game is an axe. A strong, shiny, reliable axe. And what do you do with it? You use it to pass through a door and then you leave it behind!Seriously? Is that credible? You find a weapon in a terror game and you drop it? For the God sake, in the real life I would marry that axe if I could keep it that way. Nothing more to say.PS: The rest of the game is like those crappy freeware Slenderman games but also with a disastrous translation.			"

												I'll be honest, I bought this game because it was on sale and had genuinely good reviews. Watching the trailer I didn't get the feel of a slender game. However once you start playing, that's exactly what it is. You go around the asylum looking for notes left by your daughter while you watch out for The Hat Man. So if you're a fan of slender games go ahead, but if you don't like them, don't buy this game. It was a let down.			"

												Prepare to die screaming…or more likely laughing at the horrendously bad voice acting of ‘The Hat Man: The 20+ Pages’……wait….wrong game (and more on the voice acting later).  Alas, just as has happened with so many other indie horror games in recent years and with the advent of the Slender series, ‘The Hat Man:  Shadow Ward’ (the ‘for real’ name) falls victim to the same ‘collect quest’ gameplay  mechanic.  This means that you need to find a set number of pages from your daughter’s diary to complete the game.  Ultimately, that’s the basis of the game:  you either play as the father or mother in search of said daughter, who has gone missing from the seemingly empty asylum she was committed to which is now populated by shadow people/The Hat Man (BTW – the idea of shadow peeps is based loosely on fact and there are many documented cases, and even some decent movies, about people that have seen or had encounters with these so-called ‘Shadow People’).  Thankfully, you don’t just search for pages as you also need to find some other items to progress deeper into the asylum and defeat The Hat Man (who I guess is like the pimp of the shadow peeps) to get your daughter back.One of the more unique attributes of this game (though it’s been done before) is that sound is utilized to pinpoint the location of pages/other items you need by means of whispery voices.  Also, the sound design of this game isn’t half bad for being a budget title, with some of the sound effects/ambient music being pretty creepy in my opinion. Now as promised, I must go back to my earlier comment about the voice acting.  Granted, this game is super short and can be beat in less than half an hour, so you may think that voice acting wouldn’t be too important in such a game…..but it kinda, sorta totally is.  Essentially, it’s hilarious.  No, seriously, I’m not joking.  I mean, it’s so stupendously bad that it’s good (I don’t know how that works; it defies the human intellect to comprehend how that can be) but it’s true.  I figure most people will laugh at it, though some may actually want to cry at how bad it is.  And for all those 100% achievement unlock Steamers out there – prepare thine selves!!  There is actually an achievement for listening to your daughter reading the pages of her diary as you collect them.  Sure, this game can fairly easily be ‘100%’d’ and the aforementioned achievement is easy enough to unlock, but don’t go joy-puking your faces off just yet as I seriously believe that listening to all of the pages may very well land you in an asylum. I personally just barely managed to keep my sanity intact while unlocking this achievement, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.This game can be fun for like 2 hrs tops, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price, even if it is a budget title. With decent voice acting, who knows, perhaps this game could have been terrifying.  As it is, it will likely be overlooked by most gamers, but it is somewhat interesting and good for a laugh….or cry, so give it a shot. "

												“The Scariest Game of 2014”?I know these marketing techniques and they usually don't influence me, but I still went ahead and bought this game for like 25 cents because, why not? One can argue that for the price any game is worth it, except The Slaughtering Grounds, but actually there's games that are pretty much similar or even better and they don't ask for a penny. With all due respect to the developers, this game is an attempt at being something and I can see it, but fails due to the large amount of bugs and many other problems. I'm really nit-picky so I will address a lot of things in this review that most people maybe don't have a problem with.When booting the game, I recognize the Unity launcher right away. Me and Unity games usually don't go well, but I can't judge a game by it's launcher obviously... Then the game boots up and a crazy amount of FPS makes me almost certain I'm going to have tearing issues, so I check Settings, only to find out that there's no option for VSync. I thought this was a standard in game options by now! Key bindings are pretty simple and I did try to change the inventory up and down bindings to my mouse wheel and it doesn't work so I'll just stick to the T and G keys, I had never done that, and it's terrible.Finally I choose Play, and I pick to play as the Father. Upon the first second of the game... there it is, the damn screen tearing all over the place. Quite hard to ignore but since most of the game is dark as hell, I give it a pass. So, I go upstairs, touch a book and the game has officially started. So the first complaint is, although I know a lot of people just skip it nowadays but, tutorials please. I had no idea what I should be doing and how should I progress, you can't expect me to rely on the internet to find out how to escape or kill a damn ghost that just clips through the wall and grabs you in the first SECONDS. Turns out I just needed to Zoom my lantern in her face and she dies. Then it seems I have to pickup... pages? Wait isn't this like that game where you're in the woods and... yes it is. You're pretty much lying if you say this game isn't a copy of Slender: The Eight Pages inside 4 walls because it clearly is. What it does differently is the fact that this is randomly generated, and it works well for the most part. You go right pass 3 rooms, and if you go back the map has changed. This is actually very interesting and an idea that I found to be wasted on a game like this.So you do get the book and those pages, and finally enter this sort of asylum, this is where you seek the pages that your daughter wrote, as this is some sort of dream that you got to save her from. Upon collecting the fifth page, when the little 5 green balls are lit now on my HUD (which I had no idea what they were for like 2 hours), the almighty, spooky and fearsome enemy spawns. One of the main flaws in this game is the so called ""Hat man"", because he's just laughable, he just floats and follows you trying to catch you. Which he will never do since you can outrun him easily. Then he despawns somehow. This is the whole game, or pretty much all of it. Then again I do say, the lack of tutorials make this game so much harder than it is, no one actually gives you any tips on how to evade the Hatman or even progress in the game. The journal pages do give you tips but I don't feel it's enough for the player to actually understand what he has to do. Just to clarify, the little orbs in the HUD indicate that a new item to progress in the game has spawned and is now placed in the random rooms, so you need to find 5 pages for each new item to progress in the game.Another complaint I have is, sound effects. You might ask, what sound effects? Exactly, there's barely any. When I die, playing as the father by the way, the sound of me getting caught is of a woman, what the hell. Also, the Hatman himself hardly makes any kind of noise, he doesn't even make a sound when he catches you...The Hatman spawns are literally the only thing in this game that makes it hard and infuriating to say the least. And when you get cornered there's no way to go, making it such a cheap way to make you lose. Since there's a lack of manual saving, you're only allowed to save if you find certain save points, but these are hard to come by and you will lose a lot of progress. Also, the worst thing is when you've made good progress and the Hatman literally just clips through the damn floor and kills you. That made me rage-quit this game so badly I actually was about to give up on this, but I still got to the ending because I like self-torture, and achievements.The atmosphere is... good! Despite the game being flawed to hell, having a not-creepy-at-all enemy that's just annoying and the lack of sound effects, the atmosphere does feel tense, and the feeling of not knowing where you should go because the game is randomly generated does give it a feeling of anxiety, since you never know what's on the next room, it could be the spooky scarecrow or the next exit. But please take note, a scary game doesn't need to have the brightness of the ocean depths. Don't rely so much in darkness to make your game scary. I hate games that are way too dark. I know horror has to be dark, but I like playing a game, not just hearing it.As for my final thoughts... The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, is it worth your time? Sorry, it isn't. With this formula there's so many more like this, and they're probably better executed, probably free too. I always wonder if developers read these reviews and reading what I just wrote would leave me heartbroken, but I have to be honest, Hat man is a poor game and I cannot recommend it. 2/10 "

												My daughter is missing. They told me not to come, but like I wouldn't come if my daughter was missing. But nobody is here, how could I get in the way if nobody is here? The setting is creepy, theres a fan on the wall behind the desk slowly turning. A painting lies in front of me. I feel drawn to it, almost as if in a momentary trance. I snap out of it, and head up the stairs. I walk into what appears to be a little girls room - maybe my little girls room.A chair is on the ground in front of me, it looks knocked over....I walk to the bedside table. A diary is sitting there, so I go to open it to read it.All of a sudden, the diary's pages start moving on their own! The world turns dark and grey as the book flies off the nightstand towards the door! Now THAT got my attention! I walk towards the door to leave. Locked....i must have missed something. I go to pick up the diary that is now on the floor. Theres voices and whispers all around me! Holy crap i've got to get out of this room!Then a poorly rendered silhouette with white eyes moves slowly towards me - but theres no where to run! This must be the first jumpscare!It moves towards me painfully slowly. It makes a very corny and poor audio quality screech as the camera shakes slightly, extremely un-scary.'He captured your soul!'No, they captured my ♥♥♥♥ing 19 cents.1/10			"

												There is a reason this game is 19 cents (depending on what country you live in) I would label it as a ""So bad its good"" type of game The voice acting was so bad. I've seen better performance in a adult film. It follows a Slenderman pattern (such as getting pages and avoid running into Hat Man) but this game has a better story and explanation. 2005 called, it wants its graphics back. I watched Pewdiepie (I know what your thinking, Omg Pewdiepie? Really?) play this game when it was in demo stage and i must say the game looked better as a demo.However, i do appreciate the effort this game tries to give. My best reccommendation is to pick it up while its 96% off.			"

												I’ll admit I maybe spent longer studying The Hat Man: Shadow Ward’s death screen than it deserved. But it so nicely summed up the game for me that I couldn’t help but appreciate that I was being handed a focus point for my review without even having to look for it.But let’s step back for a moment because it’s not just the death screen important here, but how you arrive at it. After scurrying through a twisting, self replicating maze of stock textures and out of place items, you’re inevitably caught the titular Hat Man in all his floating jack-o-lantern glory. And what’s this? He’s opening his mouth and- oh, I guess that wasn’t supposed to happen.And just like that we’re transported to a perfectly flat, perfectly bland death screen featuring three buttons, each drawn with the same ugly font and taking up almost the entire screen. I realize it’s a screen that didn’t need to have much detail, but what’s here is such a pitiful excuse for a menu I couldn’t help but laugh at it.I suppose I can give The Hat Man that much anyway; it made me laugh. First at the ridiculous voice acting that I want so much to believe was intentional. Then when turning around and laying eyes on what I think was supposed to be a terrifying demon but looked more like a blazing smile.And finally at the death screen, which I saw many times and eventually decided was a good enough place to give this game a rest. After all The Hat Man is just doing his job haunting this asylum, and doing it damn well at that, so I’ll just leave him be and go do literally anything else to try to forget this ever happened.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Here are my main gripes:Has potential, but I feel like I was ripped off when I paid 14.99 for a 250mb game. I feel like a 4.99 price tag would be more appropriate. The voice acting is painful. I'm pretty forgiving of things like this, but wow. It actually made the game less scary because some of the comments were very out of place and sarcastic. When you're doing a horror game, the feeling needs to be raw with genuine fear. How are we supposed to be afraid if you aren't? I don't feel like I have enough time to sit and listen to the journal entries. Whenever I try to listen to or read one so I can learn about the story, hatman comes and kills me. I don't know if this is a glitch or normal, but I can't learn about the story if I get killed every time I'm reading the journal. I really wanna know what's going on with the lady's daughter but I still haven't much of a clue as to what's going on in the asylum.Here is what I liked:Running around collecting pages/piecing together a story. Some folks feel like it's too bright, but I disagree. You can't have shadows without light. When the bad voice acting wasn't ruining my immersion, I was actually scared of the hatman and rushing through the asylum trying to find everything without dying. Though I wish he was a little less agressive so that I could have more time to explore and see the rooms/read journals. So with all of this being said, I'm still trying to complete the game. These are just my opinions for right now and may likely change.  "

 ""Hope is tomorrow's veneer over today's disappointment."" The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a first-person game developed by the company Game Mechanics with emphasis on survival. Atmosphere & presentation: + Occasionally the game succeeds to scare the player. o The randomly created corridors, rooms and items offer a certain replayability, but the multitude of negative points in the general presentation of the game decreases the motivation to play it again.o Solid sound effects create a partially threatening environment.- The player has to face only one threat in form of the Hat Man, which results in a rather low level of difficulty.- The A.I. and general collision system of the antagonist is poorly implemented, e.g. it tends to get stuck in the wall. - At the beginning the player leaves an axe behind, which negatively impacts the credibility of this ‘survival’ game. Characters & story: - Sloppy story telling. - No characterization of the protagonist.- No voice acting during the entire game.- Very short game that can be finished in less than 30 minutes. Summary: Hat Man does not work out as intended, because it has been released in an unfinished state. After 30 minutes, which it takes to finish the game, you will only remember the weak A.I., repetitive level design and sloppy story telling. Therefore, the advertising slogan 'the scariest game of 2014' can be considered a blatant lie.

Basic InformationTitle:  The Hat Man:  Shadow WardDeveloper:  Game MechanicsPublisher:  Game MechanicsGenre:  Atmospheric HorrorGeneral ImpressionThe Hat Man:  Shadow Ward is the dev team’s first release on Steam, but it has left an impression already. Indie horror games aren’t a novelty yet most try to stand out from the crowd and fail. Not this title though. Whlie Hat Man takes clear inspiration from the Slender series, it ups the ante by offering an equally interesting story and far more documents and items to collect at a very affordable deal. It’s more fast-paced too and you need to constantly be on the move while carefully searching the many rooms and corridors of the asylum backdrop in the game. The difficulty is also quite impressive, so it will require some trial & error. The graphics and sounds are more than decent, given the game’s budget and price point and the presence of both Achivements and Trading Cards, make this game worthy of any horror game collectors on Steam.Strong Points+ Interesting setting and storyline.+ Steam Trading Cards & AchievementsWeak Points- Unbalanced difficulty.- Short and with no replay value.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												So, I have to preface this game by pointing out that I was given this game for free by one of the only marketers that isn't an idiot in the industry, who handed keys for the game out free of charge to drum up press for the price drop and the free update.Ignoring that, the game isn't actually bad, but it IS something you've probably played before; this game is a slightly more involved version of Slender.If you weren't scared by Slender, or games like Slender, you won't be scared by this.This is half of why my review may or may not be something you should listen to, because quite frankly this sort of thing is fairly distant from what I consider my affair.You're chased by numerous ghosts and the HatMan, all of whom look like the bad guy from Ferngully. Also, you can find the credits to the game in a room, killing most of the atmosphere that's set by the idea that the game is based on a true story.Aside from that, the environments are very enclosed, dark asylum settings, so it raises the question of whether you'd get this for cheap, Slender for cheaper, or Amnesia/Outlast for a bit more than this.I do have to say if nothing else the game is actually reasonably priced when it's on sale for 20 cents, although five bucks may be a bit much.I'm actually a bit torn, because I don't actually see this doing too well outside of 20 cents to a buck territory, because the entire presentation is fairly amateur and ends up being something I'd compare to free unity games, but damn that marketer was nice.Can't say I can recommend this past a sale, because the actual content just isn't the sort of thing you'd usually see charged for.Also, for the half a person that cares, I think I bugged achievements so... There's that?			"

												The voice acting was pretty decent, but everything else fell extremely flat for me. Cliche setting, collecting notes when there were a number of other more interesting objects in the world that could have been collectible instead. Poor optimization and performance. An atmosphere shattering ""credits room"" in the beginning of the game (in the actual game world, not intro credits). An unclear story, non-threatening monster, confusing layout, generic copy-pasted art. I could go on. Just a very mediocre effort all around. I'm not sure what the developers were trying to accomplish, but they missed bigtime.			"

												Don't waste you money on this.This game = walking around and finding lost pages items + sometimes ghost(?) will scare you. That's all.And finding pages in complicated, repetitive-designed rooms is quite boring. "

												A solid, low-budget first-person survival horror closely linked to  Slenderman: The Eight Pages , housing a fair amount of haunting images and thick atmosphere, evoking a handful of steady cold shivers and durable tension within its short run, mostly due to the eerie and restrained sound design.Your daughter has gone missing from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. Once you enter the vacant facility, investigating her whereabouts, you begin looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being hunted by a dark presence wearing a hat.The basic gameplay of finding a bunch of objects to unlock new areas for further exploration is quite easily comprehensible, yet it may be a fair disorienting challenge to obtain all 20+ pages since the randomly altering level design relocate the pages on each playthrough; though once you pinpoint the location of a page, whispery voices are in effect and narrowing it down become child's play.The stiff level design is utterly mediocre at best and visually it is quite dull, but the ridiculously awkward voice-over is the shattering winner to listen to and hence should have been left out. Also, the poorly written dialogue comes out far more silly rather than intriguing, and finally - considering the source material that is based on real events - the outcome turns out quite immaterial.At a discount however, coupled with appreciating solid scares, Game Mechanics' short piece of indie horror, regardless of being a Slender copy, earns a night's attention. 5,5 / 10			"

												This game starts with a somewhat interesting concept. You can choose between a mother and a father, which so far, the only difference that it makes is that your death scream is different. You're trapped in some kind of demonic ward, or should I say, a shadow ward? This ward is always changing, so you have to keep moving forwards all the time. You gotta collect pages, too, like in Slenderman games, but way more, and a few other items along the way like matches and levers. You pretty much run between corridors, and now and then, you'll hear some kind of whispering, telling you that there is an item in a side room. If you miss an item and leave the room, just keep running, there is no point in going back, it probably changed already.The main enemy of this game, is the Hat Man, a being that from a distance kinda looks like a trenchcoat wearing guy with a hat, surrounded in a cloud of blackness and with a purple aura. Later on, he changes to something different, that's way faster and more persistent, adding a bit of fear to the mix. That being said, the problem with these procedually generated games is that, sometimes, it's way too random. And in this game's case, sometimes you're going to be able to finish the game in less than 30 minutes, sometimes it's going to take way longer than that. It took me around 30 minutes for a room I needed to spawn. I even believed my game was bugged. The game's atmosphere is kinda creepy at first, being chased by this creature that never stops. (Actually, he does, when you enter a certain kind of room, like stairs or the room with the pit)It's got some weak jumpscares, too, like a ceiling light falling, or a wheelchair moving. The problem is, after running from the Hat Man for a while, and after seeing the same rooms and the same jumpscares over and over again over the period of....dozens of minutes....It kinda starts to get old rather fast. It's quite a short game, and it doesn't offer much. It's really, really cheap, too. So, all in all, it feels stale, and it gets old rather fast, but I did find it fun for a short while. Maybe playing lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games myself kinda made me more tolerant to this kind of stuff, but, If it's on sale, why not? You could try it for yourself.			"

												You made a game based on a really neat concept, and something which affected me deeply when I was young. However, you slapped this badboy together in a weekend, and in the first three minutes of gameplay have an immersion slap to the face by making a room filled with your developer credits and logo. The enemies give you literally no opportunity to react. This feels like a pre-alpha version of a game. Straw that broke the camel's back: The game is too frusterating to be scary.			"

												First off I'd like to thank the devs for a free copy of this game. I'd love to recommend it but in its current state I just can't. It has the potential to become a good, fun horror game. I could live with some of its flaws but some are just too major. First off: the voice acting. It's bad. Immersion breaking. Second, the map is basically a huge never ending maze of very similar, and the same rooms. But the biggest flaw, and the game breaking one. This could be a fun slender clone but the issue is that its just not scary. I only saw the monster once when I played and I was never scared of being killed. He's not fast enough, or dangerous enough, you barely see him. With some updates this could be a fun game, and easily worth the $5, but it just needs more difficulty and more scares.			"

												I played a game like this back in April, called Daylight.While that game seems to have had a higher budget, they both accomplish the same thing fairly effectively. The gameplay is quite similar.Basically you need to find the pages of the daughter's journal in a randomly generated hospital-shaped maze... which redraws itself.While you do this, there is a creature called ""Hatman"" who tries to catch you.There are also smaller shadow-people which can be banished with a flashlight.The catch is: Using the flashlight attracts the Hatman.Not a bad game, and it tries to do a few things that are quite difficult to do. Mostly get things to happen in the right order, with the player looking in the right place at the right time... without forcing them to.As with Daylight, the results are mixed. Mind you I am not aware of any game which has pulled that off without issues.A fun ride, if a bit short... which is good otherwise you'd become used to it.Don't look too hard at it and just enjoy the playthrough. Sort of like a made-for-TV horror movie.Popcorn optional.			"

This game is really like a Slender instead there are more pages to find. There is also a little advantage because the pages can be hear when player is near. Hat Man Shadow Ward have simple storyline and some other objectives to do, nothing special but when you consider very low price... it could be a good horror game for one night. "

												If you were looking for a good horror game, don't even consider this game. Not only are the graphics absolute trash, but the whole game seems to revolve around collecting the remaining two pages in the rooms and finding items. Finding the items is an absolute nightmare and I only managed to find the crowbar, matches and a spike pit featured in the trailer video, all in one hour. That is literally how long it takes sometimes due to poor game design and repetitive room layouts. The room layout is so repetitive you easily lose your way and have difficulty even telling where you are, it's essentially a walking, searching and escaping simulator all mashed up into one. Not to mention the AI for the Hat Man is atrocious, since all it does is ""teleport"" to a location directly in your field of view, namely in front of you. He goes through walls and can't be shaken off, as he'll just ""teleport"" directly in front of you again when you have all five pages of the journal. He looks like some image taken from google and plastered onto a model and called the oh-so-scary Hat Man. As for the Shadow people, I never even encountered any of them. The only thing I'd seen that would even possibly be close to that was at the beginning when you click on the journal and a creature shows up to steal your soul, but I think even then that's just the Hat Man. It's a bit like Dead by Daylight, Slender: The Eight Pages and Vanish all combined to make this pathetic excuse for a game. You walk away and instantly the rooms have changed, making it impossible to find your way back. Some hints or even an explanation of what to do would be nice so I'm not aimlessly wandering around halls, running from the dreaded Hat Man, who's kill animation makes me want to throw up. Shockingly enough, the audio and atmosphere in the game was tolerable. Audio would get extremely repetitive, but the occasional radio playing badly done music was fairly creepy. Also a falling tile or light, whatever it was, was a good trick, but the novelty wears off really quick and you grow to expect it. Same for the mysteriously moving wheelchairs, although those can get you caught if you're unlucky (Or daft).So overall, this game isn't really something you should buy, especially at full price. If you're really that desperate to try it, wait until it goes on sale, that way you won't be as disapointed. I'm disgusted people say it's a quality game and recommend it, as a troll or not, because this is worse than Rob Zombie's '31'. And that movie was terrible. Really, if you want a quality game that still has the room changing mechanic, install Vanish on GameJolt, it's good and free.			"

												A tense experience that behind some pretty cheesy and hilarious voice acting actually has a surprisingly interesting and well written story. It plays similar to that of a game called Slender except takes place inside an asylum in which you have to locate your missing daughter. I'm not usually a fan of these kind of games but this has my interest. Would be interesting to see what developers like this (real people) with a larger budget could produce as this actually has a nice layout, good design choices and an effectively tense atmosphere.

												This game has a scary atmosphere and sound effects, but voice acting is fairly cheesy (hearing someone say ""Hoooooolyyyy"" really takes away from the scare experience). The Hat Man is fairly slow and rarely seems like a threat. You have many vents and spots where you could hide from him, but I never had to use any of them. Game is fairly short (40 minutes to beat it my first time), so the price tag is questionable. Not worth it unless it is on sale or they fix the slow and buggy Hat Man A.I..			"

Sadly, the only thing that seems to have changed is the frequency that the ghosts spawn. Hat Man still isn't scary and he follows you around like a little lost puppy.If loud noises scare you then by all means buy the gamePrevious Review.As someone who loves to be frightened by jump scares and suspense games I decided to get the game. There were very few bad reviews and many more good reviews and the video looked amazing.Sadly I didn't find this game very scary at all, it could have been so much more than it is.			"

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a must-have for gamers who love horror. I feel positively about most aspects of this game. First of all, the price. This game is very affordable at the price of £0.79, although I picked this up in a sale (£0.19!), and it is worth it! I feel this game is quite underappreciated for what it is. The plot of the game itself is interesting, but yet not very unique. A mental asylum is quite common to see in horror games, however, copying ideas can result in a better game overall (the way I feel about this game). In no way at all will I compare this game with other horror survival games such as Outlast or Alien: Isolation, but it must be said, this game is genuinely scary, what you'd look for in a horror game.I feel the way this game's layout is set is great, for example, the beginning of this game has a few doors that I myself thought you'd be able to open, but cannot. This can result in disliking the game or liking it even more. For me, this tactic doesnt mean the map is too detailed, and I like that. Many times I've played games that have had too many places to go to, when in the end, all I had to do was go through the main door. Adding details like doors that canot be opened helps prevent wasting time, which is great, getting to the next point of the story without wasting time or lowering suspense. Like I covered previously, the main obvious plot is not too unique, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all! Having a man chase you through a mental asylum is, of course, going to be a common theme. (Please note, the actual story to this game is rather unique, and the fact it's based off a real life story makes it all the more scarier!). The controls are easy to use, the game is not too basic nor complicated, and there are plenty of them (and they're rather familiar with other games). Graphics, textures are all fine, and the flow of gameplay compliments it well.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I appreciate games like these that are affordable, fun to play, not complicated and that give you a few hours of enjoyment. I'd strongly recommend this to people who enjoy horror games.			"

												I was frightened by The Hat Man: Shadow Ward the whole way through, it is a whole lot more than just walking around collecting pages. There is obviously something very supernatural about the asylum and combining this with reading the pages bit by bit to piece together the story of your daughters’ disappearance, you start to feel like maybe you have the same fate as her. Or maybe you are her.Check out my full review here http://imagengames.com/the-hatman-shadow-ward/ "

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a survival horror game where you play as a parent trying to find your daughter in an insane asylum. Along the way, you collect items, pages from your daughter's journal, and avoid the Hat Man. At first, I was impressed with the graphics, sound, and voice overs. Once the game began however, my enthusiasm was drained to find out it was just another Slender style game. I was disappointed by this because the idea and concept of this game was so great. It could have become a great adventure, survival horror game, but by modeling the game play of a Slender game, it just becomes a ""spin off"" of Slender. I wouldn't abandon the concept at all, but instead work towards making a bigger game with the concept. As much as I like the concept however, I just can't recommend this game I'm afraid.			"

												Hat Man is scary!  It is legit creepy.  The only thing that irritated me were some of the mechanics in the game.  Getting stuck on the monsters with no where to go (like on Stairs etc).  If you want to know what this game is like, if you've ever played Slenderman (the original), it's just like that, in that you have to pick up papers (pages) to proceed.It just needs to be patched up a bit more and some of the 'player tested' mechanics adjusted, but it's definitely a nice little romp for cheap.  My livestream viewers were creeped out more than once.  The way you are stalked by the monsters has to be the most tense and excited I have been in awhile.If you'd like to watch me play a bit of the game.  Take a peek in the video below.

												Neat little first person horror game that plays kind of like Slender along with some key items you need to find in order to proceed with the game. It's short, cheap, and bitter-sweet. In other words, it's alright.The Bad:The voiceovers for the journal entries were a bit dull to say the least, and even one of the entries completely didn't match up with the text, sounded like a different voice actor/cheaper microphone.Opening doors and equipping items is like pulling teeth. For doors, you have to be extremely close, and your clicks don't even register half the time. As with items, there's delays and its unresponsive sometimes.Jumping is literally useless, and leaning is too slow and doesn't go far enough.The Good:You will probably♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks at least once in one of your encounters, luckily for you, I have the worst colon in the world, so that's impossible for me. I did jump at least once though.Eerie environments and sounds.Bad AI makes enemies unpredictably scary (Something kind of like Afraid of Monsters)The Objective:Your goal is to get about 20 pages of your daughters journal, slowly uncovering the mystery of your missing daughter at an insane asylum, with the enemies getting more aggressive the more entries you pick up. You also need to find some key items to proceed throughout the game. You can save your game on TVs, unlike Slender. You must also avoid the shadowy figures chasing you down every now and then, or they will glue themselves to you and eat your face off faster than you can say ""Game Over"". After you get the 20 something pages and do a certain something, you've beaten the game.Game isn't too difficult, and it lasted me about an hour with about 4 deaths.So if you're a fan of horror games (like Slender), you might want to give this game a try.

												""Victims worldwide have reported seeing this man peering into their homes, their bedrooms, their cribs, their cars, their lives and even into their souls!"" Now it's peering into your computer screen through this nice little Indie horror game.My first encounter with a Shadow person I was like, ""Wtf is that? That's not the Hatman, it's not wearing a hat!"" It didn't seem like much, so I just stared at it and then.....It ate my soul. This little kid with a black blanket over it's head continued to eat my soul for about 15 minutes until I figured out I had to collect pages for the journal lol. Once I figured that out, I moved on, searching the ward for more journal pages. The creepy atmosphere and sounds made me constantly do 360s with my flashlight thinking I was about to lose my soul the whole time.Overall, it's not a bad game. Usually games like this force you to play in a lower resolution than preferred, but this actually lets you choose. If you like creepy, suspenseful games that makes you feel like something is going to murder you wherever you go, then give this a chance.			"

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an indie horror game, seemingly heavily inspired by Slender and similar games. You play as the father(or mother, depending on which you pick) of a young girl who was sent to an Asylum. You receive a message telling you that your daughter is missing and you decide to go look for her in the Asylum. Upon entering her room and opening her diary the Asylum changes, the diary explodes and the first Shadow person appears. You are now compelled to gather all the pages of the dairy as the games gets progressively harder with each page. Overall, the game is pretty graphically outdated(it's an indie game with a limited budget), but they were able to get the spooks pretty well(the SFX were nice, too). The voice-acting is either purposely bad or just bad, so it kinda makes it hard to get scared when the voice-acting makes you wanna laugh. There are some bugs and the Shadow people are pretty slow and you get rid of them quite easily. One of the biggest issues was the fact that upon dying I was cast back to the beginning, hence I'd recommend a way of saving the game or just more checkpoints. If you wanna get some creepy atmosphere going I suggest buying the game on sale, there are better titles out there, but it's still pretty solid.>I'd give it a 5/10>Pros: Spooky atmosphere, achievements, randomly generated map, allegedly based on real stories.>Cons: Bugs, inability to save/rare checkpoints, the enemies aren't that tough, voice-acting, short, graphics are outdated, the rooms look almost the same but it isn't that bad.Copy supplied by developer.

-Quick Review-The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an indie ""horror"" game that adopts many game play features from Slenderman, but expands on them to bring you a some-what-suspenseful-page-collection-puzzle-game, and far more fair to you then Slenderman ever was. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  You play as either the father or mother searching for their daughter in an insane asylum, after stumbling across your daughters journal, the book is ripped asunder. You now need to puzzle your way through the labyrinth of the asylum and collect pages of your daughters journal and tools to help you progress to the next series of rooms.The voice acting is pretty amusing, it's just the right combination of ""expressive"" and ""emotionless"", probably first-time-voice actors. If nothing else you need to play just enough to hear some of the ridicules things they say. ""What the...? Now you have my attention"" Game Play: As I've already eluded too, the game takes the ""page collection"" and ""being chased by a noisy black figure"" from the Slederman series. (I'll stick that in spoiler tags if you're really that sensitive)I haven't played very many horror games so I won't pretend to well versed in the art that is ""scaring people"", I do know that whenever I play a scary game my whole goal is to keep myself from expressing it. This game succeeded in keeping me in suspense and catching me by surprise a few times.Potential key game play feature spoiler: after you start the game by finding the journal, you need to puzzle you way through a sequence of rooms that will randomly change, however to unlock a new area, you need to use a specific item to progress, such as opening a special door, or moving an obstacle.  Achievements: The achievements are fairly straightforward; finish the game fast (30 minutes is the fastest achievement), finish the game without saving, and then the rest are pretty simple or obvious repeat-to-get-this-achievement.Update: May 24, 2015. Ruh roh, it looks like three of the achievements are bugged, the counters for: Paranormally Active, Cheating Death, and A Good Book are broken and not adding up properly. This maybe fixed someday, but judging from the forums the achievements have been broken since at least May 1st 2015. Price: The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is priced at $4.99, I was gifted my copy by one of the developers (thank you!), the price is pretty fair, considering the effort put into the game. However you probably won't put more than a couple hours into the game. Conclusion: When it comes to Indie games, I tend to prefer to show support for up and budding game developers. This game might be a skip for most people, but it does have promise and takes a few steps in a different direction from the original inspiration.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 24, 2015:Update about broken achievements within the game.

												Will the real Slenderman please stand up?    A short while into The Hat Man: Shadow Ward - after your first, frustrating encounter with the title, erm, ""entity"" - you'll come across a room with the game's credits scrawled all over the walls.  In the thirty-odd minutes that I've humoured this game thus far, that's easily the most inspired and ""original"" idea which I've encountered.  And between the complete lack of footstep sound effects, the ridiculously fast ""walking"" speed of your character (maybe YOU'RE a ghost, too?), and the highly uninspired graphics and sound design, it's hard to recommend this to anyone bar the most hopelessly horror-addicted among us.     Maybe I'll bother to return to it again some day, maybe I won't.  I believe ""meh"" is a word favoured by the young'uns these days... Verdict: 6/10. (PS Did it really take THAT many ""game designers"" to make a game this ordinary?  I'd be a tiny bit embarrassed to be up on that wall, in all honesty...not utterly humiliated or anything...just faintly embarrassed.)			"

												If you like this kind of game where you run around in circles, go for it.If you hate games with questionable FOV, then dont pick this one.This is small budget game, with ""decent"" graphics, not really responsive controls, weird fov at 1080p, non-existing story/challenge.			"

												On sale for two gumballs. It's worth more than two gumballs.. I compare this game to some brainless arcade game, playing for a while before you figure out what you're supposed to do. I have a feeling there are no maps, but generated halls and rooms. I could be wrong, but only save points are memorable and safe. Just keep running.			"

												I normaly dont play scary games but i thought hey this games cheap may as well give it a go, worst decison of my life, not because it was scary but beacause of how unscary it is. Every time i saw the selender man o i mean shadow hat man or what ever he is called i couldent  get scared maily because of the fact that the chacter looks about as scary as a bear standing on 2 legs pretending to be a person, which in hindsight is pretty scary but thats not the point am trying to make.overall i give it 3 out of ten because the game cost like 20p and i doubt any one will read this any way but just thought i had to make this point clear.

												You should buy this if you like horror games like me, and at $0.19 I think it's a pretty good deal. The game has an interesting story, same with the gameplay I think it was very good, I didn't get the feeling I was playing slender any moment so I don't know what you other people are talking about, I personally wanted this as soon as I read that in one of the reviews. Maybe the Hat Man used to teleport towards you before? I don't know, but I really liked this game and I loved the ending, and I didn't have a problem with the voice acting, if you don't like it then you can turn that off ingame. You need to read the diary to understand what's going on.Conclusion: Buy it, and how it costs right now it's a joke, if you are looking for a nice little story with someone chasing you all the time, then this is your game, it made me scream several times.

												I like this game. It took me 10 minutes to get to the spawn because I did not understand I had to click on a book. You need to find pages which make a sound when you're near them. I don't know how many you need to find because I never completed this game. If you stand still for too long near a page, shadow people will appear behind you. Also the Hatman follows you slowly. I think the more pages you get the faster he gets but I'm not sure.Also don't walk back to the spawn. I did that a couple times on accident. But you get trapped between a gap with spikes and the Hatman. You can't walk past the spikes and neither can you walk past the Hatman.This game is fun for maybe half an hour to two hours.If it's worth 19 cents depends on you.			"

												  The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an atmospheric indie horror-adventure game.  You play as father/mother in search of your daughter wich was sent to an asylum because she attempted suicide. The asylum is haunted by shadows and The Hat Man.  You walk throught the asylum and search for pages. You might think this is another Slender clone, but no it's not! In this game the pages tell a story. I'd rather compare this game to Daylight.Both games take almost the same time to complete. Daylight had a bigger budget than this game bud it didn't acomplish at least half of what this game does. I sugest getting this game instead of Daylight (I tryed both and I regret getting Daylight).Here is a list of things that make this game great:-The Hat Man The Hat Man is an original creature. I find it very cool.-fantastic atmsophere-builds tension The game builds tension. As you walk through the hallways they become darker and darker(by darker I mean scarier). Sometimes they even give you the sensation of deja vu.-dynamic map(the map is different every time which adds replay value)-it has puzzle elements-it has good sound effects-it has achievements-you can play as 2 characters the father or the mother. -it has achievements-it's pretty short but who says games should take hours to finish? The game has replay value due to randomly generated map and playing as diffrent characters.In conclusion  The Hat Man: Shadow Ward it's great if you like horror game. I consider it a little gem. "

Review for The Hat Man: Shadow WardPros Good scary enviroment Amazing sounds to get you scared Game isnt that buggy especially for being an Indie game Randomly generated, different everytimeCons Game doesnt really tell you what to do.  I figured out that you were trying to find pages just from seeing three in the main room Controls are abit weird My pc had weird framerate issues with it  Becomes kind of redundant at times when running through the hallsOverall Review        You play as the parent to your child who has gone missing in an asylum.  You find pages written by your daughter in her journal that has a baby face on it?  After you collect it in the beginning, you set off inside to find more pages.  You then come to realize that you are being followed by the man in the hat (aka the name of the game).  You also realize that the rooms are randomly generated as you go through and even if you go backwards the room that you were in will have been changed as well.  This allows for some interesting adventure to the game but the rooms do get repetative.  There are little jump scares that happen throughout the game though like a ghost girl will faze through the wall or a light will fall on you and play a loud sound.  You also find different items throughout the game like matches will help you overcome later challenges. Overall I would rate this game 8 out 10.Misc stuffI purchased the game for 25 cents when it was on sale.  Though I wouldnt mind buying the game full price because of how much I enjoyed it.  Sure its a ""Slender"" knock off but the game is randomly generated unlike slender where you walk through the same areas over and over again until you find the pages.  This game is also an Indie game and I would really like to see where it goes.  This is an amazing start for a horror game and I cannot wait to see what the developers will do to make it even bettertl;dr -its a small download-its fun-its scary-it doesnt cost alot-its an Indie game			"

												Disclosure: received free copy of the game.Shortly described this is a Survival running horror game that has randomized elements as the map is different on every play trough. The hallways even change during the same session if one walks away far enough so it really is random. Difficulty is quite tough and constant restarts actually reminds me of Receiver, a game that is not a horror game but has the same random map every time you play it and similar kind of (illusion) of choices - and both have quite tough difficulty that goes up slowly but surely. I have no idea what people mean when they say in some reviews that this game is a walk in the park - they must mean earlier versions as after some 3 hours i have managed to beat the game only once using save points. So many things CAN and WILL go wrong even after you think you have the mechanics figured out. For me the concept just works. I have a lot of horror games in my library but not a nifty little horror game title like this.  This game will not blow your mind and redefine the horror genre but in my books it doesn't need to. It is enough to preferably bring a new element and solid gameplay and you have a game worth it's price and this the game is able to do. This is not a large game like Penumbra series/Amnesia nor is it a design marvel of a game squeezed into a tight space such as Anna.Cons? Few but there are some. Rough edges here and there are annoying. Clicking on items is best done by clicking franticaly it seems. Beginning of the game is also weakest. For example if the game is so well into randomized hallways then i'd prefer to skip the early pleasantries after awhile. Also ghosts coming trough the floor at you can be a problem when changing floors so stairs require your full attention. I was also killed for the first time before i even got the flashlight. Tiny details like these which dont matter at all after some hours but add to the rough feeling in the first 30minutes. i'd also not see the face of the Hat Man at all during death. Like games better that leave it to players own imagination what happens when you get caught.  (sound can also  be sometimes more effective than visuals)3 hours clocked at this time and will be expecting at least some hours more as i have not yet grown tired of the game. i'd say this is a good addition to the horror library.

In shortLet's get one thing straight: Hat Man is a creepy game. It's really good, but it has a few things keeping it from being perfect. It has a few bugs, the voice over for the main character is pretty bad, and it has a strange sense of direction. However, the good things definitely outway the bad ones. The ambience is great, and it made me nervous even when nothing was happening. Plus the story and voiceovers for the daughter weren't half bad either. It ended exactly when it should've too, and I left wanting more rather than thinking, ""Thank god it's finally done"".PROSGREAT ambienceRandomly generated pathsBetter story than most horror gamesLength is just rightBelievable voice acting on daughterCONSA bit buggyUnfair difficulty at timesCertain mechanics didn't work wellMain character's voice acting was poor "

												It's a slenderman type of game. You have to find pages inside a hospital type of building that can be seen as a maze and there's this gibus wearing ghost with white gleaming eyes who probably died in a humiliating way after suffocating on a maglite he tried to eat or something who's only purpose in life is to clingle onto you like he's the worlds most annoying backstreet boys fangirl. He's not a challenge though even though the game hints you to hide until he moves on every player can outrun him. The game has a buttload of random glitches too but which ones you'll get that's for you to find out. They kinda work like a slotmachine at the casino you have to pull the lever and see what you'l get.For 19 cents during a big discount i say this game is well worth it because it's hilarious but don't buy this game at full price unless you are absolutely 100% sure of it.All the best!(s.i.e)			"

												I WILL EDIT THIS IF MY OPINION CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE GAME, THUMBS UP FOR NOW BUT WISH IT WERE A LITTLE BIT BETTER:TL; DR:Good game for about $5 (I obught it for a 21 Cents during the Steam Summer Sale, SO definetly worth it for me). The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is just not that scary and slow developing. A little buggy and could have more time put into programming it properly but worth the $5 definitely. Storyline is interesting, just wish the characters would be more into it and less bugs with more constant fear factor which makes you wish you never played it cause you want to sh*t yourself with every step you make. [7/10]WELL! It's a great game for about $5. I only playd it for about 20 minutes but from my experience with Horror games I know that in 20 minutes you can fountain♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself way more than just a couple of time. Maybe this game has a lot more coming but even if it does, it is very slow developing. I found myself running through the corridors instead of slowly walking and praying for my soul so nothing jumps at me. Just doesn't have that 10/10 CONSTANT fear to it. It is pretty buggy too. Wrong Journal page is being read when you didn't even collect it yet (when you turn on Voice Over). When I died for the first time I didn't really get startled and believe me I startle easy. As my soul is being sucked out I hear a woman screaming who is probably the Mother; I chose to play as the father. Why did I give it thumbs up? It is a simple game programmed by someone who didn't charge us too much to have a few scary moments here and there and all in all the game is more fun that it isn't. It's still interesting to find out what is going on, the only thing I didn't encounter yet is that OUTRAGEOUS CONSTANT FEAR MODE. The fear which makes you question yourself ""why the hell am I doing this to myself?"" Even the voice of the Character you choose is so nonchalant (casual and meh) While he just saw a f*cking horrible sight. It's a nice twist to be honest, if you want to see it from that prespective; but it definitely lowers the fear factor of the game as well. I am forced to give it a 7/10, thought I would give it more but who knows how it will develop, still too early to stamp it as JUST OK. I will edit this if my opinion changes througout the game.			"

For much of your play time you’ll run around corridors endlessly without a limitation to your stamina, you’ll see the same events occurring time and again while Mr. Slowmo chases you from the back.Although the randomly generated map is nice, it did not help much to deter the boredom, nor did the seemingly useless inventory of items. If you’re really dying for a horror title, only buy this when it’s on a sale.			"

												This game isn't for everyone. But it IS based on a true story.IN FACT, my story. I know it sounds like bullgarbage but imagine seeing this without being able to move. It's certainly original by using a real life [disorder?] and expanding it to be a central enemy.Now, I honestly don't play it much out of the fact that I live and suffer this, it's not hallucination, it's waking up paralysed and seeing things. It's across all cultures though most call it Hat Man, Old Hag, or a demon sitting heavily on your chest. I've experienced these with terrifying reality, being that I wake up with a dream state and reality blurred together.Why does this matter.. well it is based on far more than one true story, and takes it to another level. I will probably never play this game a whole lot for fear of triggering worse or other effects. [soon after, I started to wake up and ""lag"" with a rubberband effect. I woke up 17 times and I had to claw my way out of bed only to finally wake up.]I don't think they can capture the phenomenon and the absolute, crystalline horror. But they did a good job of expanding it into a ""full story"" and making it playable. From experience they perfectly captured the ""inescapable shadow"" [most common non-contact think one sees AFAIK.] Buy this game if you suffer from this and hopefully it will be theraputic but most of all buy this game if you want to feel and scratch the surface of a sublimely beautiful condition, that at it's heart, is truly a unique thing and 99% harmless to the average person.Seeing such horror in real life while waking [some while sleeping, but I suffer both sides, mostly waking.] is actually ""cool"" in my opinion. But the worst part is knowing it's not real, but seeing what you see and the feelings of not breathing and need to escape WILL show you that willpower will not save you.But..I just fear one day I will wake up and it will be all too real.

												Well i must say, that i'm really suprised with this game...This games talks about a girl, that lives in a asylium, and disappeard, your job, as dad/mom (2 characters)Is to find out what happened with her.The game has really decent graphicsWell, this game is the scariest game i've ever played, i've never been scaried before, with an horror game... this is fantastic!Basicly, in this game, you run/walk inside an asylium, looking for you daughther, but the sounds, are so horrible, that you will not pay atettion to anything... while you are exploring the game corredors, rooms and etc, many sounds confuse you, and you need to grab items, and read jornals, so you know what is happening...The thing is, the soul of your daughter sometimes will appear, and you need to run away, and worst, the hatman... is always running behind us, and we need to run away, and flee, you must buy this game, totally, is so cool!!!!! never believed this game could be that nice for 24 cents..Bad aspects: - '' no save games '' you need to find televisions to save, and they are hard to find.. - no sounds while running / walkingGood aspects:- scary- story- sounds- characters- itemsmy rating is:8/10and yes, we can finish the game, you need to constantly run away from the hatman, find the items, and where to place them. just be patience, you can do it, tried 7 times, on the 7, i passed the first part, and then you find a tv, so you can save the game.. another tip for new players, read the jornal pages... you will need it.If you crouch, without the flashlight, he will pass you, cuz he can't see you( the hatman) on the 2nd part of the asylium, he will change his form! be readty =) scariest game i've ever played!!!!

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an indie horror adventure game. You play as the father or the mother of a girl who has gone missing in an insane asylum. You arrive in the asylum to go looking for her, but there is nobody in the asylum except for a ghostlike creature called the Hat Man. You spend the game running away from the Hat Man and meanwhile collecting two kinds of items:- diary pages written by your daughter, explaining a bit what's going on and what you need to do next- items that help you advance e.g. at the very start there is a barricaded door => you pick up a nearby axe and use it to remove the obstacleThe asylum's hallways and rooms are continuously generated at random. So I didn't really like the fact that you couldn't rely on your memory and orientation skills to find your way in the asylum. You just need to keep running until you come across the item you need to advance to the next part of the asylum. What I did like about 'The Hat Man: Shadow Ward' is that you get a short thrilling experience for nearly no money at all. When I finished the game, I was surprised to see I got the achievement for finishing the game in under half an hour. It seemed longer what with the running around through the endless hallways and what with reloading when caught by the Hat Man. But the game shouldn't have been any longer than it is, because it's too 'basic' to entertain for hours. Now, at the price of this game (and especially when on sale) I think it's certainly worth playing if you're into the horror-atmosphere type games and are willing to settle for a quick, cheap fix.

While not a groundbreaking slender clone, its well enough put together to justify the current price. Not a must play by any means, gameplay and graphics are simple but effective. I think a lot of the other negative reiviews were posted back when the game cost a lot more, but now its on its reduced price its worth a punt if you like the horror/slender genre.			"

												What is this game supposed to be.After some trite narration by the mother and father of Microsoft Sam, you wander out into some corridors inflicted with assorted copypasted assets and weird sound effects evocative of Penumbra's challenged cousin. It's terrible.I've read that it is or is supposed to be randomly generated, but mostly you're supposed to collect papers while running from a series of comical looking black lumpy things with jack-o-lantern faces. It's tense for all the wrong reasons. If you stand still, monsters get you. If you don't stand still, you get really lost because everything looks the same.Why would you play this when Penumbra exists. It just about as ugly as this, but it's also entertaining.This game is♥♥♥♥♥and will make you straight.			"

												This game is not what I expected, The enemies are basically giant turds that slump on the ground desperately looking for something, possibly the toilet. Maybe it thinks the player is the toilet... Is that why it attacks us? Maybe it just needs a friend. Maybe its just on drugs, like Heroin. I think so. Do ghosts do drugs? Where would they get them from? A dead drug dealer? I guess the drug dealers have to make a living after death too. Too bad they died. Some of them were pretty cool.			"

Though not to say the game is good, BUT 96% Off is well worth a laugh why not buy Copies of this ""Game"" and send it to your friends. Friend: Wow I love you thanks for the free game :D.You: *Trying not to laugh* your welcome :3 As it says based on a true story Omg really?! That seems 11/10 legit - IGN i like that this is put but the game devs see their own game as pathetic in reality xD really Im rather proud that they made this in ""python"" and is a well crafted master piece.Father: As if my daughter had gone missing *Pause* And i wouldnt come looking for her.So basic story <SPOILERS> Not that its worth spoiling.Your a father or a mother of some insane daughter. Within this your daughter has made a journal < Upon picking up the journal You will get witty bad acting remarks such as. ""Suddenly the fun house doesnt look so fun..""There are some amazingly cheap jumpscares within this such as;Falling lights!A ghost? A old lady with crooked teeth that can go through walls and floors...A annoying noise that sounds like radio static...---Then---So eventually you escalate up the stairs your like G_G finnaly finished this errr master piece. Then your like pffttt it was all a dream. This game was A TEN OUTTA TEN.

												I bought the game for .19 and sold trading cards for .21 so it worked out I guess. I wasn't able to finish it as the save system  didn't work right. Its not terrable, for a small company its good. It's pretty much slender, only weaker. The voices are also pretty bad. The two main character voices are extremely horrible and yet the girl voice isn't bad. The problem is that it tries a bit too hard to be slenderman and thats not something you can beat. Plus you can litterally see hat man and either outrun him, or hide from him pretty easily. Not to mention there is some hand holding as your screen makes noises when you get close to the paper or needed object. Still, it is scary even if asylum theme has been overused in games and is destroyed by games like Outlast that is amazing. Still, the jump scares are decent at times and the enviroment is spooky but the game isn't perfect. The developers are pretty amazing though as this game was free and they even gifted me another game they made which is pretty awesome. Overall, buy it on sale for practically free or get it for free by friending the group and making an honest review. You gotta start small before you get bigger.			"

												I was in the lobby, went in the hallway searched and searched (I went straight forward in that hallway).Then everything got quiet and I hear the hart go faster and faster. Some black mist appeared around the corner, it was the ghost (the hat man). I ran straight back towards the lobby, but there were only more hallways. The lobby had disappeared.I look back and I saw no ghost. I thought I escaped from it, then I turn back to proceed, and when I turned around the ghost was right in front of me (like in horror movies), it screamed and he took my soul.I totally recommend this game, its one of the most scary games I've ever played.

												You are either the father or mother (you get to choose) of a daughter who has been put into a mental ward for her own safety. The thing is something has happened there, and even though you were told to stay away you have decided to check up on your daughter. That's where things start getting even stranger. You leave the elevator and can't seem to find anyone around. You locate your daughter's room and find a journal with a strange looking face on it. Upon touching it you are transported into the Shadow Ward. The journal's page scatter in a strange wind that pulls through the mental ward when you touch the journal. You will have to collect the pages if you are ever going to find out what has happened to your daughter, and perhaps find a way out of this situation for yourself. You see once you enter the Shadow Ward you will find that you are no longer alone.In The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, you will find that there is a shadow being that goes by the name of the Hat Man. The Hat Man seems to be stalking the halls, and if he catches you you will be paralyze, your soul stolen, and if you wish to try your luck again, you will have to start from scratch.On the outside this looks like a very scary game where there's going to be tons of jump out of your seat scares, and to be honest when the Hat Man catches you, most of the time it will make you jump out of your skin. The only problem is some of the mechanics. When I talk about mechanics I'm talking about several things in the game.The first mechanic is the randomization of the game layout. I'm all for changing things up through each playthrough, but that being the case I feel like this game would have GREATLY benefited from a checkpoint system. The way I would have done it is that you have to collect the pages in groups of five. I do understand that this would probably screw up the random locations of the pages, but I think there is a level of frustration that starts to creep in, especially since the Hat Man's location could literally be in the wall in the room you start your adventure into the Shadow Ward.The second mechanic is the inventory system, maybe it's my computer, but it took an act of God to change items that were currently equipped. Now thankfully you're going to be spending the majority of the time with the flashlight in hand, but it would have been nice if the game would have allowed a smoother transition between items.The third mechanic surrounds the journal pages. Part of what makes this game creepy is what is written in the journal pages, and currently the only way to actually find out what are in the pages you picked up is to go into the journal. Why not just have the audio start to play upon picking up the page so that the player isn't taken out of the game to find out what is on the pages? Oh and if you have to go into the journal to find out what is written on them, the audio should probably match up to ALL entries. There's at least one case that I can think of off the top of my head where the page had something other than what was being said to me.The thing is this game has that spookiness to it that will keep people on edge, but with just enough randomness to cause people to get frustrated. I know its a race against time as you try to stay 2 steps in front of the Hat Man as you try to recover all the journal pages, but when his location seems to be randomized, and the first playthrough I met my demise without ever really getting into the game, it kind of kills the want to play again.I'm going to be totally honest, I have yet to fully complete the game, but it isn't from a lack of trying. The only way that I've been able to get anywhere in this game is from constantly sprinting through the entire game, and listening for the whispers, that's when you know you are close to another journal page. I appreciate that there are items hidden in the game that cause you to have to really search the area, but without a map to refer to and the fact that you have to stay constantly on the run, there's a really good chance that a player could be doing a large loop over and over again not knowing what to do, scared that if they slow down and start to really investigate the Hat Man will appear, and you'll have to start all over again.So here's the deal, this game has its moments, and I think it is possible, if all the stars align that this could be the experience that I think the developers are hoping the player gets, but with all the random variables, and the fact that the Hat Man can strike right off the bat, this game is too much of a game of chance to really enjoy. This game gets a 6.2 out of 10.			"

(-_-)It's a pretty decent spook gaem (for me) since I am terrible at horror games and horror in general, but only if this game would tell me what I am supposed to do. All I found in my first 30 mins or so of playing this game is 3 pieces of paper, a flashlight, and a box of matches. I'm confused probably because I haven't done anything yet, but do you actually get to find your daughter?Either way, gud game, I will recommend it, especiallly because it was 19 cents when I bought it.

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward... Basically a worse Slender game with more pages, and a slight advantage when collecting them.~~~Story:You can play as the mother or father of a girl, Virginia Berry, who was put in an insane asylum for attempting suicide. Virginia has gone missing, and you go a look for her. You pick up her journal, and it 'corrupts' you, and you must collect all 22 pages, and a few other items to save your daughter before the 'Shadow People' get you and capture your soul. As you collect the pages, it tells you a story of her reading the book about the HatMan after a woman told her to. She wasn't sure why, but she did.~~~A little Canton Insane Asylum background: Canton's Asylum is located in West Virginia in the United States. Congress has passes a bill creating the only 'Institution of Insane Indians' in the US. (So, I'm guess this family was Indian. [That's beside the point.]) It was opened in January 1903, this asylum was also sometimes called Hiawatha Insane Asylum. Many inmates put here were not mentally ill. The asylum closed in 1934. Atleast 121 died, and more than 350 patients were detained here.Flaws:-TV's were not invented until the 1927's. So I don't think that the TV's with static were a good placement for this time period.-I think if the developers did a little research on the place and time era, they could have made a better plot, giving an more intreaging story, and a better experience.~~~Sound:The sounds were hilarious for this game. The voice overs for the daughter, mother, and father, and the Hat Man. The Hat Man, when he takes you is the best noise in this game. (I'm kidding, it's also really bad.)To be honest, I actually like the music from the music players. They are not too bad.The pages make a whispering noise that is very obnoxious, and annoying. Maybe not to others, but to me, I did not like the noises for them.-If more time was put into the sound, it could have helped enchance the game play, and actually make this is a scary game.~~~Challenge:This game really isn't challenging... wait. Why can't I pick up my axe again after I used it? Okay...~~~I wouldn't recommend this game. The play time is short, and not very interesting to me. I would not replay it after I beat it, which I won't beat.-I haven't finished the game. I've given up trying to figure out this hell hole.Rates:Story: 4Challenge: 3Sound: 4Replayability: 1Enjoyment: 4Frustration: 3			"

												I got this game for pennies and I was looking for some scares and jumps and there where a few, so I guess I got a fair deal after all, even when is not that scary or overly atmospheric. Mostly is about things chasing you and putting pressure on you to escape or die. Guess that is some kind of a ""horror experience"", but games like this are not my cup of tea: too much running around a maze of halls and rooms almost identical and often getting lost searching for little things to advance, there's no map nor any way to be sure you went already into some place and that gets annoying fast to me... but totally can expect other players to have fun with Hat Man, others with a better sense of orientation than me, that is. Anyway, I recommend if you're not expecting much, cause there ain't much besides that scary thing coming at you. Nevertheless, a little dose of adrenaline is at times worth the time and the dime.

												One of those games that gets blessed by the holy -86% discount hand of gaben (correct me if im wrong, forgot). Trading cards you get from this game actually cost more than the game itself, so when you sell it on the market, the game earns you money instead.As a side note, those friends who own this game are usually cheapskate profit masters like myself.Pros:>Gives you three trading cards ($0.36 in my currency)>Very cheap ($0.20 in my currency)>profitable ($0.07 after taxes)>cards can be easily obtained by IdleMaster (don't worry, you will not get banned)>makes you look like a hardcore game collector so you get nice badges and look cool.Cons:I actually don't know, never played the game.

												This game is creepy and mean. I think the game should save everytime you find a page, but alas you cannot save your game until you find a TV (I read) so everytime the shadow people or hat man get you, and trust me, THEY WILL GET YOU, you have to start all over! Whether flashlight is on or off they can still find you and hiding is a recipe for disaster, only thing you can do is hope to outrun them and even then if they are too close they can pass through a wall and still get you no matter how quickly you move. Good news is you CAN sprint! Uhm...great story so far. I have never played Slender yet, but I hear this game is a lot like that. You explore a Silent Hill-esque asylum looking for useful items and pages which are clues to the unfolding story. You can kill shadow people with the flashlight, but you CANNOT kill the Hat Man until end game.10/10 Scary Voices = Good 10/10 Heavy Breathing = Good10/10 Heart Beats = Bad-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A shadow person (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity. Many methamphetamine addicts report hallucinations of ""shadow people"", as a result of sleep deprivation.A number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe shadowy spiritual beings or supernatural entities such as shades of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories.Although participants in online discussion forums devoted to paranormal and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe. Some paranormal investigators and authors such as Chad Stambaugh claim to have recorded images of shadow people on video.Several physiological and psychological conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A sleep paralysis sufferer may perceive a ""shadowy or indistinct shape"" approaching them when they awake paralysed, and become increasingly alarmed. A person experiencing heightened emotion, such as while walking alone on a dark night, may incorrectly perceive a patch of shadow as an attacker.Many methamphetamine addicts report the appearance of ""shadow people"" after prolonged periods of sleep deprivation. Psychiatrist Jack Potts suggests that methamphetamine usage adds a ""conspiratorial component"" to the sleep deprivation hallucinations. One interviewed subject said that ""You don't see shadow dogs or shadow birds or shadow cars. You see shadow people. Standing in doorways, walking behind you, coming at you on the sidewalk. These hallucinations have been directly compared to the paranormal entities described in folklore.The explanation we get from skeptics and mainstream science - and who are usually people who have never experienced the shadow people phenomenon - is that it is nothing more than the active human imagination. It's our minds playing tricks on us... our eyes seeing things in a fraction of a second that aren't really there - illusions...real shadows caused by passing auto headlights, or some similar explanation. And without a doubt, these explanations probably can account for some if not many experiences. The human eye and mind are easily fooled. But can they account for all cases?To call these entities ghosts demands first a definition of what we mean by ghosts.But by almost any definition, shadow people are somewhat different than ghost phenomena. Whereas ghost apparitions are almost always a misty white, vapor-like or have a decidedly human form and appearance (very often with discernible ""clothing""), shadow beings are much darker and more shadow-like. In general, although the shadow people often do have a human outline or shape, because they are dark, the details of their appearance is lacking. This is in contrast to many ghost sightings in which the witness can describe the ghost's facial features, style of clothing and other details. The one detail most often noted in some shadow being sightings are their glowing red eyes.The dark countenance and malevolent feelings that are often reported in association with these creatures has led some researchers to speculate that they may be demonic in nature. If they are demons, we have to wonder what their purpose or intent is in letting themselves be seen in this manner. Is it merely to frighten?One interesting idea suggests that shadow people are the shadows or essences of people who are having out-of-body experiences. According to Jerry Gross, an author, lecturer and teacher about astral travel, we all travel out of the body when we are asleep. Perhaps, this theory says, we are seeing the ephemeral astral bodies of these twilight travelers.People from our own future, another idea states, could have found the means to travel to the past - our time. However they are able to accomplish this incredible feat, perhaps in that state they appear to us merely as passing shadows as they observe the events of our timeline.Even mainstream science is fairly convinced that there are dimensions other than the three we inhabit. And if these other dimensions exist, who or what (if anything) inhabits them?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recommend this game for the experience, however, I will probably never finish it or play it largely based on the highly unfair mechanics. For example, every time I happen apon a certain part of the asylum where there is a large hole in the floor, the Hat Man always appears behind me and there is nowhere to run to. You can either jump to your death down into the hole or have your soul devoured by Hat Man. I consider that a gamebreaking bug. I hope the Dev will add places to hide from Hat Man, or create a device that can at least temporarily freeze him, something exhaustible so you can only use it so many times, or once and such items are randomly placed, but rare. I would like to see more variety of rooms or even randomized rooms as one poster in the forums suggested. The game can be expanded with a few doors that need unlocked and a key may be found. More props and assets to decor rooms and hallways. More gore! More scares and weird Lovecraftian notes to read which possibly shed light on the Shadow People phenomena similar to such info I pasted here from wikipedia. A few more checkpoints in the game. Maybe game saves, if not with each page pick up, but maybe with those special ""key"" items like matches, crowbar, etc. This game is amazing, but currently 'replayablity' is a huge issue since, well, basically you have no choice at present. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: RUN!

												2 Achievements are broken and the devs seem to be MIA, so let that be known.What we have is a horror collectathon in the same vain as Slender with a meh story slapped on top. It would be rather scary were the monsters not horrible looking (as in they seem like spoopy ghosts) and the protagonist wasn't constantly giving quippy remarks.Just under par voice work and one or two cheap thrills is all you'll really find here. Controls are tight, but the scares don't last for long, as the Hat Man is easily outrun (there's even an achievement for doing so 10 times) and the whole psycho ward loses its haunted vibe very quickly. The first few doors are unnerving to open, but after that everything just becomes an obstacle, blocking your escape from the monster(s) or your discovery of game-progressing items.			"

You can either jump to your death down into the hole or have your soul devoured by Hat Man. I consider that a gamebreaking bug. I hope the Dev will add places to hide from Hat Man, or create a device that can at least temporarily freeze him, something exhaustible so you can only use it so many times, or once and such items are randomly placed, but rare. I would like to see more variety of rooms or even randomized rooms as one poster in the forums suggested. The game can be expanded with a few doors that need unlocked and a key may be found. More props and assets to decor rooms and hallways. More gore! More scares and weird Lovecraftian notes to read which possibly shed light on the Shadow People phenomena similar to such info I pasted here from wikipedia. A few more checkpoints in the game. Maybe game saves, if not with each page pick up, but maybe with those special ""key"" items like matches, crowbar, etc. This game is amazing, but currently 'replayablity' is a huge issue since, well, basically you have no choice at present. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: RUN!

												This game is creepy and mean. I think the game should save everytime you find a page, but alas you cannot save your game until you find a TV (I read) so everytime the shadow people or hat man get you, and trust me, THEY WILL GET YOU, you have to start all over! Whether flashlight is on or off they can still find you and hiding is a recipe for disaster, only thing you can do is hope to outrun them and even then if they are too close they can pass through a wall and still get you no matter how quickly you move. Good news is you CAN sprint! Uhm...great story so far. I have never played Slender yet, but I hear this game is a lot like that. You explore a Silent Hill-esque asylum looking for useful items and pages which are clues to the unfolding story. You can kill shadow people with the flashlight, but you CANNOT kill the Hat Man until end game.10/10 Scary Voices = Good 10/10 Heavy Breathing = Good10/10 Heart Beats = Bad-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A shadow person (also known as a shadow figure, shadow being or black mass) is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, particularly as interpreted by believers in the paranormal or supernatural as the presence of a spirit or other entity. Many methamphetamine addicts report hallucinations of ""shadow people"", as a result of sleep deprivation.A number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe shadowy spiritual beings or supernatural entities such as shades of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories.Although participants in online discussion forums devoted to paranormal and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe. Some paranormal investigators and authors such as Chad Stambaugh claim to have recorded images of shadow people on video.Several physiological and psychological conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A sleep paralysis sufferer may perceive a ""shadowy or indistinct shape"" approaching them when they awake paralysed, and become increasingly alarmed. A person experiencing heightened emotion, such as while walking alone on a dark night, may incorrectly perceive a patch of shadow as an attacker.Many methamphetamine addicts report the appearance of ""shadow people"" after prolonged periods of sleep deprivation. Psychiatrist Jack Potts suggests that methamphetamine usage adds a ""conspiratorial component"" to the sleep deprivation hallucinations. One interviewed subject said that ""You don't see shadow dogs or shadow birds or shadow cars. You see shadow people. Standing in doorways, walking behind you, coming at you on the sidewalk. These hallucinations have been directly compared to the paranormal entities described in folklore.The explanation we get from skeptics and mainstream science - and who are usually people who have never experienced the shadow people phenomenon - is that it is nothing more than the active human imagination. It's our minds playing tricks on us... our eyes seeing things in a fraction of a second that aren't really there - illusions...real shadows caused by passing auto headlights, or some similar explanation. And without a doubt, these explanations probably can account for some if not many experiences. The human eye and mind are easily fooled. But can they account for all cases?To call these entities ghosts demands first a definition of what we mean by ghosts.But by almost any definition, shadow people are somewhat different than ghost phenomena. Whereas ghost apparitions are almost always a misty white, vapor-like or have a decidedly human form and appearance (very often with discernible ""clothing""), shadow beings are much darker and more shadow-like. In general, although the shadow people often do have a human outline or shape, because they are dark, the details of their appearance is lacking. This is in contrast to many ghost sightings in which the witness can describe the ghost's facial features, style of clothing and other details. The one detail most often noted in some shadow being sightings are their glowing red eyes.The dark countenance and malevolent feelings that are often reported in association with these creatures has led some researchers to speculate that they may be demonic in nature. If they are demons, we have to wonder what their purpose or intent is in letting themselves be seen in this manner. Is it merely to frighten?One interesting idea suggests that shadow people are the shadows or essences of people who are having out-of-body experiences. According to Jerry Gross, an author, lecturer and teacher about astral travel, we all travel out of the body when we are asleep. Perhaps, this theory says, we are seeing the ephemeral astral bodies of these twilight travelers.People from our own future, another idea states, could have found the means to travel to the past - our time. However they are able to accomplish this incredible feat, perhaps in that state they appear to us merely as passing shadows as they observe the events of our timeline.Even mainstream science is fairly convinced that there are dimensions other than the three we inhabit. And if these other dimensions exist, who or what (if anything) inhabits them?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recommend this game for the experience, however, I will probably never finish it or play it largely based on the highly unfair mechanics.

												The game is really good, even though it is short. It took me about 30 minutes the first time I beat it. In the beginning it may seems confusing, but after a while you'll get the hang of it. You are in some sort of hospital (I think) and the Hat Man is chasing you through it. The only thing you can do is to run, which is always a good thing in horror games, because you feel defenseless. The atmosphere is also really spooky. The hallways are really dark and your only source of light is your flashlight. Random noises make it even scarier. The full price may be too much for this short experience, but if the game is reduced (I got it, when it was 96 % off), it's definetely worth the weight! :D			"

												2 Achievements are broken and the devs seem to be MIA, so let that be known.What we have is a horror collectathon in the same vain as Slender with a meh story slapped on top. It would be rather scary were the monsters not horrible looking (as in they seem like spoopy ghosts) and the protagonist wasn't constantly giving quippy remarks.Just under par voice work and one or two cheap thrills is all you'll really find here. Controls are tight, but the scares don't last for long, as the Hat Man is easily outrun (there's even an achievement for doing so 10 times) and the whole psycho ward loses its haunted vibe very quickly. The first few doors are unnerving to open, but after that everything just becomes an obstacle, blocking your escape from the monster(s) or your discovery of game-progressing items.			"

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward... Basically a worse Slender game with more pages, and a slight advantage when collecting them.~~~Story:You can play as the mother or father of a girl, Virginia Berry, who was put in an insane asylum for attempting suicide. Virginia has gone missing, and you go a look for her. You pick up her journal, and it 'corrupts' you, and you must collect all 22 pages, and a few other items to save your daughter before the 'Shadow People' get you and capture your soul. As you collect the pages, it tells you a story of her reading the book about the HatMan after a woman told her to. She wasn't sure why, but she did.~~~A little Canton Insane Asylum background: Canton's Asylum is located in West Virginia in the United States. Congress has passes a bill creating the only 'Institution of Insane Indians' in the US. (So, I'm guess this family was Indian. [That's beside the point.]) It was opened in January 1903, this asylum was also sometimes called Hiawatha Insane Asylum. Many inmates put here were not mentally ill. The asylum closed in 1934. Atleast 121 died, and more than 350 patients were detained here.Flaws:-TV's were not invented until the 1927's. So I don't think that the TV's with static were a good placement for this time period.-I think if the developers did a little research on the place and time era, they could have made a better plot, giving an more intreaging story, and a better experience.~~~Sound:The sounds were hilarious for this game. The voice overs for the daughter, mother, and father, and the Hat Man. The Hat Man, when he takes you is the best noise in this game. (I'm kidding, it's also really bad.)To be honest, I actually like the music from the music players. They are not too bad.The pages make a whispering noise that is very obnoxious, and annoying. Maybe not to others, but to me, I did not like the noises for them.-If more time was put into the sound, it could have helped enchance the game play, and actually make this is a scary game.~~~Challenge:This game really isn't challenging... wait. Why can't I pick up my axe again after I used it? Okay...~~~I wouldn't recommend this game. The play time is short, and not very interesting to me. I would not replay it after I beat it, which I won't beat.-I haven't finished the game. I've given up trying to figure out this hell hole.Rates:Story: 4Challenge: 3Sound: 4Replayability: 1Enjoyment: 4Frustration: 3			"

												I got this game for pennies and I was looking for some scares and jumps and there where a few, so I guess I got a fair deal after all, even when is not that scary or overly atmospheric. Mostly is about things chasing you and putting pressure on you to escape or die. Guess that is some kind of a ""horror experience"", but games like this are not my cup of tea: too much running around a maze of halls and rooms almost identical and often getting lost searching for little things to advance, there's no map nor any way to be sure you went already into some place and that gets annoying fast to me... but totally can expect other players to have fun with Hat Man, others with a better sense of orientation than me, that is. Anyway, I recommend if you're not expecting much, cause there ain't much besides that scary thing coming at you. Nevertheless, a little dose of adrenaline is at times worth the time and the dime.

												As an avid lover of horror games and resident scardey-cat, there's no better combination than a good, old-fashioned, spooky indie horror puzzle game to get the blood pumping. Although the game is quite short and doesn't have the most intricate story line, it manages to maintain a spooky atmosphere throughout the playthrough. The rooms and corridors are somewhat repetitive, but do shuffle themselves around, so back-tracking is simply not that simple. The straightforward design is accentuated by decent graphics and a very eerie atmosphere. Despite collecting (what seems like) hundreds of diary entries from your daughter, very little is actually revealed about the Hat Man, adding to his mysterious allure. The puzzles aren't exactly rocket-science, more of a ""find-the-object-and-use-it-on-another-object"" type of scenario. Nevertheless, this just adds emphasis on the fact that a creepy shadow fiend is chasing you and you can't spend time strolling around taking pictures and making mental notes of how good the wallpaper would look in your own house.Overall, I would recommend this game, especially if it happens to be on sale. Simple, effective and the voice over is hilariously awkward.Enjoy!			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Jumpscare horror game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can't change the volume sound and music.You can turn on the Voice over and Subtitles.You can change your controls.There are multiple Languages.You can't change the sensitivty of your mouse.You can play this game with a controller.You can play as a Father or as the Mother. (The only difference is the Voice).About the game.The graphics are somewhat basic. Dull.Scenery is okay but boring on the same time.There are Pac-man ghosts in here.If you like collecting pages like in ""slenderman"", Then this is your game.You have a light source as weapon.When-ever a ""missing page"" is nearby, you will hear some ""demonic sound"" from that page.There is a guy following you, slowly, so if you decide to walk back there is a chance that you might bump into him.Ghosts/Shadows in this game looks awfully bad.Other things.All of the rooms are the same.Rooms are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms that are connected with rooms........... YOU CAN LITERALLY HOLD DOWN THE UP ARROW KEY TO MOVE TO OTHER AREA'SQuests are not working properly, yet, you can still unlock them.There is an axe that is corrupted with a soul. He is destroying the door all by himself! WITH HIS OWN ANIMATION!!If the game gets a graphical make-over, then this game could start to look interesting. But the game is plain Boring.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10			"

												When I first began my adventure, into the world of The Hat Man, I wondered why steam was classifying it under s when it clearly started with T. Moving right along, I noticed from the settings menu at the beginning it was probably made in Unity; which gave me bad feels inside. Afterwards I started up the game with the highest settings possible, and the interface looked atrocious, the buttons were all comically oversized and didn't provide enough options; but I digress, I started up the game and was immediately greeted with a five nights at freddys lights sound clip playing on loop; this was to be the most scary event of my adventure.I left the elevator and went up some stairs, went into a room, wandered about it, left it as it wasn't very interesting, explored the rest of the area, went back in the elevator, contemplated suicide, went back into the room and found the silly looking book. The book exploded and I said: ""Ok, now you have my attention, suddenly the funroom isn't looking very fun!"" in a silly very non-serious voice, so I tried to leave and told myself that I haven't gotten everything yet. I didn't care, I'm not some OCD crackaddict who needs to collect everything, so I grab the flashlight on the table and try again; and to my horror I still have not collected everything. So I start cleaning up the pieces of garbage scattered on the floor thinking: ""Hey, maybe I'm a janitor in this game"" and suddenly I could leave. Oh also there was a black mage who tried to ambush me, but I slew him with my flashlight some how. So I wondered aimlessly for a while after killing a door with another silly dialogue, and admired all the five nights at freddys lights sound clip playing in every single light in the game.Eventually I got really sick and tired of picking up papers and wandering empty corridors, but I perseveered because why not. So I saw this big guy with a hat floating towards me so I went over to talk to him and made a very girly scream as I stood there looking at him; please note, he did not attack me, but I had a heart attack or I got flung back in time to when I was in the fun house room. So I gathered the flashlight and the papers-But then it happened.. The door. You have not collected everything.I gotten everything, but I couldn't leave, and the black mages kept spawning- until suddenly a black mage spawned who was immune to my flashlight, and then the game locked up, and steam locked up, and I couldn't alt+f4 out of it, and I couldn't minimize out of it, and I said ""Good Game"" and, since I have a second monitor; I simply closed out of it in task manager. It unfortunately murdered steam along with it and thus I had to relaunch steam just to post this review.I'll give it a 2/10; for the sake of black mages at the very start of the game. Next time use UFPS to manage your first person camera, and get some more original sound clips and make sure the game actually works.I have no idea why this game is even on steam; it's something which would be better off sold for free; I mean come on; Swamp Sim is more scary and entertaining than this.And now, now; I can predict what some of you may be saying; ""It's only 19 cents, what do you expect from it?""Just because something is cheap, and you should expect it to suck; does not make it worthy of being considered a good game, or a game that could possibly be recommended.

I didn't care, I'm not some OCD crackaddict who needs to collect everything, so I grab the flashlight on the table and try again; and to my horror I still have not collected everything. So I start cleaning up the pieces of garbage scattered on the floor thinking: ""Hey, maybe I'm a janitor in this game"" and suddenly I could leave. Oh also there was a black mage who tried to ambush me, but I slew him with my flashlight some how. So I wondered aimlessly for a while after killing a door with another silly dialogue, and admired all the five nights at freddys lights sound clip playing in every single light in the game.Eventually I got really sick and tired of picking up papers and wandering empty corridors, but I perseveered because why not. So I saw this big guy with a hat floating towards me so I went over to talk to him and made a very girly scream as I stood there looking at him; please note, he did not attack me, but I had a heart attack or I got flung back in time to when I was in the fun house room. So I gathered the flashlight and the papers-But then it happened.. The door. You have not collected everything.I gotten everything, but I couldn't leave, and the black mages kept spawning- until suddenly a black mage spawned who was immune to my flashlight, and then the game locked up, and steam locked up, and I couldn't alt+f4 out of it, and I couldn't minimize out of it, and I said ""Good Game"" and, since I have a second monitor; I simply closed out of it in task manager. It unfortunately murdered steam along with it and thus I had to relaunch steam just to post this review.I'll give it a 2/10; for the sake of black mages at the very start of the game. Next time use UFPS to manage your first person camera, and get some more original sound clips and make sure the game actually works.I have no idea why this game is even on steam; it's something which would be better off sold for free; I mean come on; Swamp Sim is more scary and entertaining than this.And now, now; I can predict what some of you may be saying; ""It's only 19 cents, what do you expect from it?""Just because something is cheap, and you should expect it to suck; does not make it worthy of being considered a good game, or a game that could possibly be recommended.

												This is a very very nice example with what kinds of twists and turns people can conjure up while thinking of the original Slender game. The literal PAGES you need to collect, easier to find, mind you (because you're in a building the whole game), being hunted by an also literal 'Hat Man' that becomes more aggressive with the more pages you collect for your journal. There's a short story to it as well, that kind of explain why you're collecting them, and the creatures --the Hat Man and little shadow dudes-- that stalk you and want to stop you from reaching your goal are pretty damn spooky. As I always say with horror games, they're always WAY worse wen you play them for yourself. I'd have more time on this, but it's actually kind of irritating to keep trying to make a good amount of progress in one sitting.Still, though, big support from me ^-^			"

												This game claims to be ""the scariest game of 2014"", yet the scariest thing i found was the vandalism in the toilets and the american spelling of ""Axe"". I found all the pages in my first few minutes then wandered around in the ""Shadow Ward"" for the rest, all the rooms look exacly the same and it gives you no direction of where to go. after i while i encounted the hat man. while setting up my tea set for him to enjoy he tapped me on the shoulder and opened his mouth for some cookies. I would not reccomend this game is you wanna get scared or spooked.			"

It's got a haunting eerie feel to it that makes you want to go on rather than stay put due to the fact that you know some bloody face is gonna pop up any second. Also it has a good re-play value because it's a survival like game. (But still has a story line)			"

												While the ambiance is indeed one of these horror games, I must say that Dead Space or FEAR was scarier than that. So for the scare, that's... out of the question.The storyline promised a lot. Suicidal daughter missing from her asylum, you, as the father or mother (don't know why the father sounds like the mother), decides to search for her. By touching her journal, you get... well, into another spooky asylum. Only armed with a flashlight, you're gonna lose your head: the asylum seems to change everytime. And what is that dark shadow with an hat?Slender mechanics: avoid the Hatman if you want to live. Still, he's wallhacking. He traps you in rooms (you're hidden but  no.... He's not even freaking moving away). He's suddenly on your side without warning.... still hearbeat and his ""oooouuuuuuuu"" are an indicator that he's near.Anyway, in other words, as it's randomly generated, the ""finish the game under XX"" achievements are pure luck. Right now, I'm stuck with machine handles. It's pretty boring to run away from a shadow, with random paths generated and asking yourself WHEN THAT ROOM I SUPPOSED I HAVE TO USE THE HANDLES WILL APPEAR!The save system is ""find the tv and click on it"". Yay, so, it means I need the crowbar and the man is still behind me and... Graphics are correct though. But these translations? The French version seems to be done with worse than Google Translate.In other words, unless you love bad games, avoid it. 7Days on the defunct Desura was better (yet, based on the same mechanics"". Haunted Memories is better than that (at least, Slender in that was really getting out of your path when needed). I'm not sure if I'm going to finish it for achievements. Jeez, even Gone Home is scarier and there is no paranormal activity in that game! At least, for the price, you're not robbed. And as the game is frequently at -90%...I really wanted to give a chance to the game despite reading the reviews. Unfortunately, the game failed in the horror departement.			"

												While the setting and story of the game are interesting that's about where the positives end. The first few minutes it seems great, the creepy set up, the missing people, daughter vanishing. When you get ahold of that book and everything changes, up until the first scare even. It seems great. Then you start running into problems. The clunky inventory system where i can only equip items by pressing the correct number (especially having to take my whole hand off wasd to press 7-0), which would have been managable if the rest of the game worked. The main ""boss"" of the game is a poorly scripted bot who will go through the entire world to get to you. That along with the randomly generated rooms makes him a pest more then a consistent scare. The rooms being randomly generated makes you wonder aimlessly, which would add to the autmosphere. If it didn't also make finding these objects just as random. Which would all be fine on some level if the game wasn't broken. One cannot advanced past the need of a lever. You cannot lift up the lever either. It will say you have but it will not appear in your inventory. The final nail in the coffin of an already meh game to begin with.			"

Meanwhile, on the plus side...It is indeed based on a true story. Exaggerated, but true. The gameplay is story rich and filled with jumscares.Immersive sounds for a much greater experience. Like I stated, the game is filled with jumscares. Unique and indeed, making you jump. Watch my further take on it on  YouTube. "

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a horror game that sends you off in a hospital hell to collect journal pages and overcome obstacles in an attempt to bring your daughter home. Using a simple search-and-find-the-pages mechanic used in other very famous horror games, The Hat Man also adds the twist of having a changing maze inside the asylum so that one hallway isn't always the one you just came from. You're fleeing The Hat Man, a paranormal anomaly called a shadow person, who feeds upon the sick and weak. Did I mention he can teleport? He does that.A lot.God I'm gonna steal that stupid hat and throw it down the hall and see if that'll distract him. I digress.The game isn't difficult. Notes are shrouded in whispers so as you find yourself outside a room containing one, the whispers within your head becoming maddening (they might even drive you...insane? RIMSHOT.) Your foe moves slowly enough that you can out run him or you can hide if you find a perfect method of how to do it. Rooms are spacious that if you plan things, you can loop around to bypass the hovering spectre. That is, if you're quick about it. I didn't have so much luck with this. I ended up rushing into walls and getting caught just by that last second and ended up starting over. Sigh.As this is a horror game, you're probably asking just how scary is it. Shadow people, as we know them, tend to be these looming types that are said to stand there and make you feel uncomfortable. The Hat Man is designed well enough that he gives you a you a nice shock when he teleports right into your face in a very literal way. One second you've left him five hallways away and POOF, there he is! You can also see him coming from a good distance off so you're feeling pretty free to give him the finger. He's not gruesome, but just unsettling enough that he reinforces the stories of shadow people being vague, smoky, and shadowy outlines of people who are unable to take proper forms. He's a bit menacing so that was good enough for me. Good enough for me to swear every time he tried to tickle me with those ugly hands.As for the feel of the game, I mentioned it's a good hospital hell. You've got rotting bodies, the sound of people crisping against defibs (I jumped a foot), the traditional falling ceiling tiles, loud noises to freak you out as you turn corners, and the much appreciated radio playing assorted music. I loved the pieces that made me feel like it was a Twilight Zone episode. The radio is a nice touch. It's something a lot of games do, but not many use them so nicely as this, I believe.You can play as the father or mother. This has no bearing on the story. Your child's sarcasm and dull humor as noted in the diary OBVIOUSLY comes from your commentary. You are a parent on a mission and somehow you even make some off-color comments at the start of this adventure. (Father calls the asylum a funhouse. Mother says homemaker turned homewrecker.) Upon reading the journal, even your daughter has found time to make off-color comments about her own situation. The apple has not fallen far from the tree. This amused me greatly. I didn't find it out of character at all. It seems like a perfect defense mechanism in a horrible time like that. (Referring to her attempts as a ""been there, done that"" light heartedly in group therapy which horrifies everyone who has never attempted? Yes as someone who has been there, I find this very funny.)Overall, the game is one that's simple in premise and offers gameplay that a majority can enjoy. However, I noticed a few things that did make my gameplay a little less enjoyable.Upon playing, the save function that was hinted to was not obvious to me. There was no button or indication of an autosave. Even after accomplishing a set of actions where the Hat Man was unable to get me (and I kept mercilessly taunting him until I got stuck in another maze ahaha don't do this.), there was no save function that appeared. Unfortunately, I'm a handicapped gamer and I do need breaks after hitting buttons for a while. I'm just confused if I'm missing something. I did search the forums and I wonder if only I'm missing it. This made the game entirely difficult for me and made me lose interest greatly.The mother's subtitles have a few typos. I noticed. It didn't really kill the game for me but I spotted them.The journal's audio seems a bit off. Is that audio that was placed there that we're not supposed to hear? That doesn't sound like the daughter's normal voice-over. Nothing game killing here, either.Notes for the handicapped gamers like myself: You're going to get tired while navigating. Pause frequently. Take breaks. I'm paused right now, matter of fact. There are flickering lights and flashes. If you are triggered by flashing lights at all, I would exercise extreme caution with this game. I would go as far to say this is not a good idea and play at your own risk.The story is rather unique and I'm happy to see someone use shadow people as a source of horror fuel as they're one of the most common paranormal occurrences in the world. It's a little bare bones and maybe even cliched, but it does well enough. The world of the ""limbo asylum"" is rough yet rather beautiful. You're not getting AAA graphics because after all, it's an indie horror, but it's pretty enough to know that even if the world you're traversing in does repeat in a maze of horror, there was some time taken to make sure that everything looked properly decrepit and set out. Though large hospital rooms seem more for gameplay benefit rather than realism. You will be kissing the ground for those large rooms.This game reaches a wide audience. There are those who like medical horror in their video games, those who enjoy the collect-and-boo type horror games, those who enjoy chase-type games, and those who are constantly in the need of challenging themselves to beat their time. Trust me. You'll want to tackle the achievements to beat Hat Boy in record time.			"

												Page collector 2014.This is not a terrible game.  It just is not a great game.  It is an average game that I found boring.The game is made in Unity.  You can play as either the father or the mother searching for their lost daughter in the insane asylum.  There are voice overs, and the acting is competent.   It isn't terrible, but it isn't outstanding.  Like everything in this game.As mentioned, the game is in Unity.  The engine is smooth.  The graphics are not outstanding, but it animates well.  Moving your character is intuitive, although I found the movement a little awkward at times.  When there is something you can interact with a little hand will appear, and that is when you click.The entire game, however, is just a search for pages of your daughters diary.  There are a few mild scares, and the setting in general tries to be unsettling.  Walking around a generic assylum that was dark looking for paper.... well, it just got boring.If the game is on sale and you have some time to kill for a very average horror experience, pick it up.  Otherwise there are better ways to spend your gaming time.5/10			"

But it's not like that, this game actually tries to give you something more. It's not a Slender clone at all. It has a plot and way to defend yourself and die brutally (kinda).

Goal? Anything?Well, I didn't mention the graphics since as far as Unity games go, I think this is well enough other than that. The game has no story, you have no idea wtf you are suppose to do or wtf is going on. Although right now its 19c on steam, I would say its definitely worth a buy, the atmostphere itself is outstanding but the pointless gameplay and goal is a downer. Even so, this game is worth a play since you can tell the team tried hard to work on this with a limited budget and software.Final Verdict: Get it! (even at retail price)Score:6.3/10 "

												Hat Man: Shadow ward takes place in an Asylum, you will play either as the Father or the Mother of a young girl that tried to commit suicide, which caused her to be assigned in a mental asylum for the insane in hopes that she does not do anything to further harm herself. When you first start the game, you are greeted with a note saying that she has somehow ""Gone Missing"". When you exit the elevator, everything will look just fine except for the fact that it's completely devoid of life. But as soon you will find a cursed book which will cause everything to change. The once normal looking asylum will reveal it's true state, a rotting and decrepit mess. Grab your flashlight and start collecting 22 pages in a way similar to slenderman! This is based on true stories and sightings of the one that we call ""The Hat Man"". He, along with his shadow people will try and get you so they can take your soul. The game relies heavily on the sound and atmosphere, keeping you on your heels from the start, the only thing i can reccomend is if you see ""The Hat Man"" just run, run and don't look back. When your lights flicker, then your problem is just starting, friend. Get out as soon as possible. Whispers will tell you that there is a page nearby. The Hat Man and his lackeys aren't the only thing you have to worry about though, there are other ways to die too! There's an eastern egg featuring everyone who helped this game be realised, as well as the devs near the start (if you're interested). The voice-acting isn't the best, but it's just a fresh company, we can't really expect much. The graphics are also not bad. The game is still good though. Hopefully this will be one of many to come!			"

												I was a Kickstarter supporter. This game started out as a Slender clone and has added so much more. Originally the pages were just there to be picked up. Now they tell a story. I think the problem some reviewers are having Is that they don't ""read"" the pages. The game definitely has a flow. If you play it like a FPS you will be disappointed.Could it be better? Yeah. But it is an indie title and a good one at that. This is a great game that you should definitely pick up when it goes on sale. It is worth the full price but only if you play it as it was intended. It is a lousy FPS but a great survival horror game. I jumped even the third and fourth times I played it.			"

												Prepare to die screaming…or more likely laughing at the horrendously bad voice acting of ‘The Hat Man: The 20+ Pages’……wait….wrong game (and more on the voice acting later). Alas, just as has happened with so many other indie horror games in recent years and with the advent of the Slender series, ‘The Hat Man: Shadow Ward’ (the ‘for real’ name) falls victim to the same ‘collect quest’ gameplay mechanic. This means that you need to find a set number of pages from your daughter’s diary to complete the game. Ultimately, that’s the basis of the game: you either play as the father or mother in search of said daughter, who has gone missing from the seemingly empty asylum she was committed to which is now populated by shadow people/The Hat Man (BTW – the idea of shadow peeps is based loosely on fact and there are many documented cases, and even some decent movies, about people that have seen or had encounters with these so-called ‘Shadow People’). Thankfully, you don’t just search for pages as you also need to find some other items to progress deeper into the asylum and defeat The Hat Man (who I guess is like the pimp of the shadow peeps) to get your daughter back.One of the more unique attributes of this game (though it’s been done before) is that sound is utilized to pinpoint the location of pages/other items you need by means of whispery voices. Also, the sound design of this game isn’t half bad for being a budget title, with some of the sound effects/ambient music being pretty creepy in my opinion. Now as promised, I must go back to my earlier comment about the voice acting. Granted, this game is super short and can be beat in less than half an hour, so you may think that voice acting wouldn’t be too important in such a game…..but it kinda, sorta totally is. Essentially, it’s hilarious. No, seriously, I’m not joking. I mean, it’s so stupendously bad that it’s good (I don’t know how that works; it defies the human intellect to comprehend how that can be) but it’s true. I figure most people will laugh at it, though some may actually want to cry at how bad it is. And for all those 100% achievement unlock Steamers out there – prepare thine selves!! There is actually an achievement for listening to your daughter reading the pages of her diary as you collect them. Sure, this game can fairly easily be ‘100%’d’ and the aforementioned achievement is easy enough to unlock, but don’t go joy-puking your faces off just yet as I seriously believe that listening to all of the pages may very well land you in an asylum. I personally just barely managed to keep my sanity intact while unlocking this achievement, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.This game can be fun for like 2 hrs tops, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price, even if it is a budget title. With decent voice acting, who knows, perhaps this game could have been terrifying. As it is, it will likely be overlooked by most gamers, but it is somewhat interesting and good for a laugh….or cry, so give it a shot.			"

												The Hat Man does have a questionable title, but the game is very good. You can choose from the Mom or Dad to start off as. The game might a little hard to get at first but yo will get it in like minutes. So you are a parnet looking for your daughter, but you find out that you daughter is not there. Thing happen and try to find your daughter. The game is scary too! Maybe not worth 5 dollars but maybe 1 dollar.			"

												I brought this game for a very cheap price and did not expect much of it but it manage to get me not bored until the end. Many people think or said that this is just another cheap Slender clone so my expection was very low.Surprisingly it does not feels like a Slender clone! Slenderman does not move but the hat man does :P This is less scarier than Slendy but I enjoyed the comfortable ride. The level design is ok for that price but most of the rooms feels quite empty and generic...A big plus is that you won't get loss in this game cause it will teleport you eventually in the right direction where you may find the missing papers or important items.Worth to mention is the horrible translation on the other languages like German or Russian. It feels like a google translation. I recommend you to play on English only.Well, you can't do much wrong if you buy this game on sales because it is extremely cheap!			"

												This  game is bad made. It's really, dunno, annoying. Pros: -Steam trading cars.-Looks ok for weak pc's.-The sound makes the atmosphere scary.-The enviroment makes you scary as well.Contra:- The voice, the voice impression is horrible. When everything turned out to look like an abandoned asylum, he's reaction sounded like he didn't gave a ♥♥♥♥. Besides the fact that the father and the mother end up having the same voice at some point. (or it just bugged,idk)-Lack of animations.-It's frustrating because you run from a shadow man to another, not being able to avoid them or just run near them.-You can't change monstly anything in the options menu.-It's impossible to finish.-Can't save the game.-It has bugs.-Impossible to perfect the achievements.-The game menu looks cheaply made. -The fact that you go in a room, try to find something, you read a note, when you put it down, wop, you're dead. It's frustrating to agonizing trying to finish this game.-The game isn't telling you anything, for nun's sake, when I first started playing this I had no ideea what I had to do. I still don't quite get it, I was just running thinking there is somewhere I should go.			"

												Probably the worst horror game I've ever played. Reasons below:-No tutorial. When an enemy comes up to you to eat your face off, you're supposed to defeat it with the flashlight somehow, but the game doesn't mention how.-Unplayably difficult. You need to find twenty-something pages to get anywhere, and around every corner is another shadow person or the Scat Man (sorry, did I say Scat Man? I meant Hat Man). Also, any time he gets you, you go back to the beginning of the game and have to find all those pages again.-It has save points, but they are so scarce and far between that they're nigh nonexistent.-It has a graphics quality bar that changes literally nothing.-The only scary thing about this game is how awful it is. The Hat Man is about as scary as a hangnail. The Shadow People, even less.-Blatant Slender ripoff. Find pages while a shadowy entity chases you... Uh-huh. Doesn't sound familiar at all.Save your 50 cents. Go play Slender: The Arrival instead if you're seeking something similar that will actually scare.			"

												My friend bought me this game because I spent too much money on TF2 hats. I enjoyed the tf2 hats more than this game. There are many issues: 1. The titular hat man gets stuck on litterally everything; chairs, walls, dropped marshmellows you name it, he gets stuck on it.2.  EVERYTHING LOOKS THE EXACT SAME! All blood spatters? Look the same. All doors? Look the same. 3. You have no legs and are most likey a ghost due to the fact that you have no arms and control axes with your mind.  It is not the  ""scariest game of 2014"" (Mostly due to the fact that it released in 2016...).Good things:Hat man occasionally moon walks.Radio is pretty jamming.-37/10 is bad			"

												im not sure if most of the people writing reviews for this are children or just a little backwards because this getting a mostly positive rating is just a little insane. i just played it for about an hour its basically a maze that rips off slender man as much as they possibly could get away with,repetitive,boring and now my butt hurts too..the hat man looks like a pixelated turd so if the thought of that scares you then go ahead and give it a try..it was only $.19 but i still feel ashamed for trusting the reviews and trying it.i am only going to say it once ""BAD""and now im deleting it and hopefully forgetting it.

												After playing through the game a bit i've enjoyed the atmosphere it presents. animations would be alot better, mostly around the shadow man. or whatever that thing is that makes my heart race. for it's price it's worthy for the time and effort put it. but i think i'd pay a bit more if the rooms and areas weren't alot of copies of the same textures. a more unique feel for each area would be nice. and after collecting those 5 items (the ones indicated by those dots in the top left) i think it would be better if that would be classed as a save point. just makes it a bit more forgiving if mistakes are made.

												NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS TO BE UPDATED SOONTo start this Review off I will have a detailed paragraph of the Pros and Cons I have experienced so far with a simple list of pros and cons in case no one wants to read at the bottom. Now, While this is a indie horror game so many people expect a lot of work of developer/publishers for the Genre, The Hat Man does not fail to deliver a interesting game. The one thing I'd like to note is, that I have the exact same feeling of constant dread that I had when playing Alien: Isolation by Sega. Another Pro is that Story isnt THAT bad, and I'm usually more focused on story then anything else. Now, as the store page states, The Hat Man and Shadow People are based on Real Life Stories, Which is true and as something to do i decided to look up the actual Hat Man to compare to the Model the game has. While i couldnt find that great of a image i did compare the two and it does look accurate enough. Also, while Graphics arent state of the art CGI, Its not bad for a small company. Now for the Cons. The Voice Acting needs work but i do give them credit for even having voices. Some physics need work. The last thing i can think of is im not that sure of what is my goal in the game, like am i supposed to collect all the Pages of my daughters Journal without the Hat Man getting me like Slender or is it where i have to find a specific room or what? Anyways this is the end of the paragraph, The rest is the list of Pros and Cons.PROS:*Story*Graphics to a degree*Models*The Atmosphere with the Constant DreadCONS*Goal*Voice Acting*Physics to a DegreeThank you for reading this Review and have a nice day			"

												Basicly this is an horror game where you're stuck in an asylum, searching for your missing daughter but insted you just walk around with a flashlight collecting 22 pages. Sounds familiar?The graphic looks like an early 90s 3D point and click adventure. At least these old ones had a better story.The voice acting and the writing for this game is awful. ""I didn't knew I was so good at breaking stuff!"" <Someone actually said that in the game.The  Slender  Hat Man looks like a trenchcoat tipping fedora neckbeard who thinks you're his pony OC and wants to steal you for his private collection.Final Score: DeviantArt/11I'm running low on criticism for this 19 cent worth game, I'm gonna hang myself, brb			"

												Playing this game from the begginign and even through the updates, it has been a dissapointment. The over all story isn't bad, it still needs a lot of work, but the main problems are this; its pretty much just another slenderman-styled game in terms of objective and enemies, the graphics are not that great, it is way too predictable, the hatman himself is a poor adversary and too slow, even in the updates, and he is not scary. In fact the hatman looks like a darker version of the Hatbox Ghost from Disney's Haunted Mansion. It would have been much wiser to replace the tophat with a fedora and made him look like the infamous shadow man seen throughout man decades by many people. I do not recomend getting this game unless it is given out for free or it is sold for at least $0.99. One would be better off buying a slenderman game and playing it for the slenderman would be far scarier and more panic inducing. Developers of this game, I appreciate the effort to bring in a new character to the horror game scene, but you just made remade the same game that we all have been playing for far too long.			"

Quick SummaryAn indie horror game that knows what it is, and doesn't take it self too seriously, but still can be sp00ky.Purchase Verdict:  Yes (if this is your type of game)Points of Interest-Very creepy ambient noises and haunting events-Voice acting by the main character is extremely sub-par (purposefully, I believe), which adds a little comedic relief and is very welcoming-Game mechanics and objectives not explicility explained off the bat, so you'll have to figure out how to play and how the game works on your own. Some things are explained in some of the notes along the way, though. Its an interesting decision on the devs' part. Can either be extremely frustrating or very intuitive.			"

												This game used to be 15 dollars, but has since been reduced to 2 dollars, which I think is more accurate to what it is worth. It is an enjoyable horror game, with some decent scares and excellent atmosphere. I'd say its one of the scarier games I own. If you want to see a video of me playing it, its over here:

			How has this game received mostly positive reviews? This is literally a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥..		

Not one aspect of this game is scary or creepy. The ghost is practically Slenderman with a hat. With some of the laziest level design and lack of care in terms of its interior design. The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is just another game made for youtubers to play and for kids to buy. Nothing about this game is fun or enjoyable and I'd recommend you hold onto your $2 and spend it on something else...			"

												alright, i wandered around for about 10 minutes looking at the textures an autistic kid could paint with microsoft paint, then i found the book, i remembered there was voice acting and when i turned it on i think it was scarier than the ""shadow people"" i found the journal and when i played the dialogue it started to play it all, even though i hadnt found the pages.. i encountered my first enemy and it was so insignificant i walked through it.. i was sitting in the corner reading the pages when i saw hands through the wall grab me and i lost. great for wasting minutes of your life as thats how long it will take to realize this game is god awful -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 dont ever play this game, your 19 cents would be better spent elsewhere			"

												This game has given me a newfound respect for help desk workers that are employed in abandoned asylums. After finding the journal and doing other stuff, I took it upon myself to be stationed behind what I assumed to be the customer service counter on the main floor, as I didn't want other distraught parents to be without aid in the event of their arriving to investigate the absence of their special little flesh spawns. After 5 minutes of waiting, I ultimately got bored and quit, as there was nothing else to do, and no other story to follow or objectives to complete. I guess there was this ghost blob thing too that was really upset by my presence, which is understandable as I had barged in without calling or knocking. I just shined my light in his eyes and expected him to welcome me without quarrel. Overall, This game is an eyeopener, and has a much deeper meaning than what is advertised. 10/10 I got carried away with this review, but am going to post it anyways.			"

												This game is called: the daughter where? Where is the father? Mom, where did you go? But whether you choose to play who are looking for family diary. After all call: diary to where?While the ghost before you find a near end and a loss of the diary room.Worth mentioning is now a lot of infinite random walk simulation room, this game maze do okay, is too repetitive, after all 100M games, so it is not easy, after the discount is only 1 fast, free download to stimulate or the past.Is this preservation mechanism...Okay, not what save mechanism, death can start to play.I finally finished a collection of diary pages 5, immediately thought can summon the dragon, who knows and let me find 5 more, not to find her daughter, to find the net diary, find your sister ah.So this game also can be summarized as: my wife died, her daughter missing father indulged garbage (wrong,... It is the diary)Third death is being chased by a ghost, panic ran to a corridor, into the middle of a pit, there were spikes tie die, this is new.Other packages or buy 1 pieces of charity in the game, I also went to the garbage.

												This game is pretty fun and creepy, as well as challenging, but it seems to be a bit TOO challenging in the beginning. I like it, but I got killed by the Hat Man 15 times before I figured out how to kill him/disappate him. Then I ended up wandering endless halls and got completely lost, only to be killed by a doctor/ghost thing that didn't disappear from my light, with no other available items.			"

												Probably the funniest game I've ever played. I recommend that if you're going to purchase and play this, you have a friend join you. It's funny since it's bad, yes. The voice acting is awful and the gameplay is.. Awful. The parents make witty and terrible puns as they look for their presumably dead daughter in an asylum. However, it's so bad that it's good.You feel me? It's not worth the £3.99, but as I write this, it's on sale for £0.15. So I highly recommend you pick it up quickly. You'll get your money back in cards. Summed up, I don't recommend this at all for the original price.			"

												This game is really stupid. The developers cannot spell. For instance: They spell axe ax and groan grown. The game doesnt autosave so once you die its straight back to the beginning. The so called ""Hat Man"" Guards the doors so once your trapped your trapped. You cant wait it out and wait for him to leave. He just sits there untill you get even more bored with the game then you already were and walk straight into him. And in the hope that the game saved, YOU GET TO START AGAIN. Pretty sure im done with this game. DEFINATELY DO NOT RECOMEND.			"

												What to say about this? umm...I'm not really a big fan of the survival games, however this does have a feel of Slender Man to it with collecting peices of paper, however in this game they're diary pages of your daughter who has gone missing so you're more interested and invested than in that origonal game and if you aren't one for reading, the page is ready out like a audio-log when you view it.Now for the bad points, the voice acting isn't that good. I mean it's not aweful for the girl, but the parent (Father as i played) it was pretty aweful and he didn't seem to be terrorfied that no one was at the asylum and he was being hunted by a creature made of shadow.The story to it is quite interesting and made me want to keep playing just to find out what happened at this place and who this ""Hat Man"" was as well as why he was doing what he was doing. There is certainly potential in this and it's certainly not a aweful game by any stretch of the imagination. For the price I'd say it's pretty good, especially compared to games that are 5x the price and have less than half the effort put into them.If you're interested in the whole horror series, collecting creepy diary pages that highten the atmostphere, despite the voice acting then I'd certainly recommend it. You could so easily spend your money on something much worse.			"

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is best described as ""more okay than I expected."" In a time where first-person horror games get dumped out left and right for a shot at YouTube viral status and a quick buck, I didn't expect more than a reskinned Slender-esque with a few cheap deaths. The Hat Man is still a re-skinned Slender-esque, but the reskin isn't too ugly, and the cheap deaths were mostly lacking.In fact, the titular Hat Man is barely effective as a threat at all. He's so easy to hear and avoid that it's highly unlikely you'll run into him in a game-ending sense more than two or three times over the course of the entire game. The bulk of gameplay consists of scrounging around for journal pages and other items as you try to track down your daughter, who's disappeared from her room shortly before your arrival and a sudden turn of everything for the spooky.The asylum that serves as the game's setting is fairly easy to navigate, but suffers from a lot of repetitive textures and room layouts, making getting lost a frequent concern. Eventually things shift to more of a basement, which suffers the same problem, and it's not difficult to miss some of the pages you need upon first pass. It's still not incredibly hard, but when you do have to backtrack despite thinking you've checked every possible room, it gets frustrating very quickly.Aside from the daughter's journey, as spelled out in her journal, the reasons for what you're doing as her parent (you can choose mother or father at the start) are less clearly explained. Storytelling definitely falls short outside those journal bits, which are handily voice-acted so you don't have to read them yourself. Quick tip: Don't turn on the auto-reading of the entries, but listen manually each time, as the former seems not to pop the ""listen to every entry"" achievement.My final verdict is that The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is mediocre at best. While I didn't hate it, I don't see why I'd suggest anyone else take it for a spin. At least it was really short.			"

												So,The Hat Man: Shadow WardWARNING:I havent finished the game whatsoeverTL;DR This game is fun and sometimes scary,I quitted from chairFull Review: The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a game where your daughter is at an Asylum for Attempting suicide,But she goes missing and you have to find her, Ive seen the Negative reviews but it hasnt stopped me from playing it,My Expectations werent high for Graphics or voice,But for story it was Pretty high,And it Achieved my standards.Pros:Gets scary at some points,I closed the game when a chair movedLovely radio,I sat there for minutesAxes.An axeThe cards are at high pricesGreat storyFun to play and hear your sister laughing at youSmall (About 150mb)Cons:The game gets kind of confusing until you realise you have to pick up a Journal at the startKind of like slender,But The pages are on the groundYou only get to use the Axe onceVoice acting couldve been betterNot much guidesThe gameplayThe gameplay is Quite basic,Which is good,It feels like a Slender Mod though,Instead a bit easier,The Deaths arent that scary,But back to gameplay,The gameplay is Pretty good,I mean you get to use an axe and Chop Boards (Sadly Not the Monster that chases you) with it (Reminds me of TWD Season 1) The gameplay is quite scary,I mean Falling lights scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me and the chair just made me nope.The storyThe story is about a man (Or woman,Because you choose who you wanna be) Whos daughter attempted suicide and is in a asylum, One day she goes missing and is (Or isnt) In the asylum,The player then gets a note from the Police or Detectives or whatever saying ""This is our case,Dont come,If you come youll be in the way"" But the father still goes and finds not one living thing there,Just a dead tree.VisualsThe game visuals look like they were Refined pretty well,But using a slightly better paint and shaded it with some other software or used the same things from unity,You can also find a secret room with all the Devs and Special thanks to the people who funded the project,But i think it took about a year or two to make it,I dunno.Voice actingThe voice acting is pretty basic, Nothing really special about it,But its like a skyrim mod voice actor,Its good,But its voice is terrible,I didnt laugh at it,I kind of enjoyed itOverall ScoreGameplay:8/10Story 6/10Visuals 4/10Voice 2/1020/40(5/10)			"

They can definitely use the extra cash to spice up the AI on this thing. There were moments where the Hatman glitched into a wall, stopped moving, and even went into the wrong room all together. I don't want to sound mean, it takes patience and determination to make even the crappiest games. All I am saying is that save your nineteen cents.			"

												If this game weren't for money I would suggest it. it's off that quality and there are many games that do independent horror much better without charging money for it.My first tiff with this game is that it isn't frightening in the least. Anybody can slap a horror atmosphere and put a slightly creepy character into the came, by the way, black doesn't mean scary and ghosts don't mean scary, the villain isn't good at all. Then I have to mention the placements of save points, that is, as far as I've played, you need to find the pages of journals, but it doesn't save after you find an entire journal, so if you put a good half hour into looking for most of the pages just to be caught by the hat man you are sent back to the book. Sorry, the game is not of quality and should really been given away for free. Cry of Fear had the right idea and that game was at least good, not great mind you, but still good.			"

												The poor man's  Slender  (which I also didn't like).Run through dark rooms that look almost exactly like every other room in the game. Avoid the fairly cheesy-looking villain as he chases you through walls (or gets stuck in a doorway, which I've seen happen twice now). Collect missing pages from a book. Try to figure out how in the hell to save your game. (There's apparently an option for it, but damn if I know how it works). Die, and start over again from the beginning. Turn off, and go do something else.I don't want to be overly cruel -- the devs did a good job with the sound effects, and were somewhat successful in inducing nervousness in the player through the ""stalker"" nature of the villain rather than through cheap jump scares. But the repetitiveness of the environment design and the lack of a reliable save feature eventually make the game too tedious to devote much time to. I might give this another shot someday, but for now it's going back on the shelf. Update: I've tried replaying this turd on and off again over the course of a year, and every time, I find it to be a tedious slog that depends more on procedurally-generated luck than actual skill. And I still have no idea how to save the game. Permanently deleting.  "

												Saw this game on sale for 19¢ and saw the game had generally positive reviews on Steam, so I decided to give it a shot.Graphics: D-. The first thing that stood out for me was how bad the graphics are. We're talking PS2-era graphics here, complete with low resution textures, poor lighting, the whole bit. It doesn't seem like a lot of effort was put into them. Especially with subtitles that use a basic Arial font with no style added to them whatsoever. But, graphics like these are typical in most Unity-based games and they did the job I guess.Sound: B+. Apart from the sound effect when picking up items (that sounds like someone hitting a Quarter against an empty bottle of Coke), the sound effects & music were both well done.Story: C-. Nothing fancy here, I won't go too far into it because of spoilers.Gameplay: C+. Apart from the first room which teaches you how to look for items (by listening for them), there is no other tutorial so to speak. The objective is to find all the pages to your Daughter's lost journal and to solve puzzles using certain items to get past obstructions. The rooms are randomly generated so there is no map, while this may make it confusing it ultimately doesn't matter, the game still progresses in linear fashion. I haven't quite figured out how to avoid Hat Man, but you'll know if he's close by when the screen flickers, your heart starts pounding, and the wind nearby sounds all distorted. As for scariness, I personally did not get too spooked even when getting caught my first time. In fact I was more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off than anything. Results may vary for others, but for me it just didn't freak me out at all. Overall the game can be completed fairly quicky once you find out what to do (I suggest reading a walkthrough, it helps).Performance: C. It's a unity game, so don't expect too many graphical issues like low framerate or glitches. I'm pretty sure just about any PC made after 2003 would be able to run it smoothly. The movement controls are fine, but using items and performing actions seem to have a considerable lag. There were times where left-clicking a door to open it took several times for it to work.Presentation: F. As with the issues with the graphics I mentioned earlier, It doesn't seem like a lot of effort was put into this game. Although it looks like a considerable amount of people worked on this game according to the credits, this game feels like something a dev team of 3-5 people could've made in about a month. Also, it seems like most of the achievements are broken and unobtainable due to bugs. Forum members brought this up back in May 2015 and they have not been addressed as of October. So it seems like support this game has been abandoned.Overall this game is barely worth it at 19 cents and I definitely would not recommend paying full price for this title.			"

This is a horror game right? 2) 2 achievements are broken. A Good Book and Paranormally Active. I went to achievement hunt and they're completly broken, no way of getting them legitly. If you like a good horror game, don't buy this.			"

												It's one of the worst horror games I've ever played. I went in expecting a game so bad it'd be funny and while this is mildly amusing at best paying for it will be feeding the devs and may lead them to make, dare I say a sequel.It's a poor man's version of Slender.

												The hat man is a ""Horror"" game that relies heavily on old school jump scares, and cheap visual effects. Ive seen F2P, non p2w games with far more effort put into em than this. The controles are clunky, the game is clutterd with bugs, and the atmosphere and gameplay are on the lower end of the gaming spectrum. i give this sorry excuse of a video game a solid 1/10. Still byfar better than no mans sky. Buy if horrible games are your thing.			"

												Okay wtf is this. You don't get any good objectives (I just don't ♥♥♥♥ing get what to do) and you can't fight the ghost which makes it really ♥♥♥♥ing hard to gather all the notes and stuff. She keeps following you and it just doesn't end. The story is probably good, but the gameplay ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I died a few times and that was it for me. Waste of money. This should be a free game on gamejolt or something. Within the first minute of the game, the ghost starts chasing you in a ♥♥♥♥ing small room which ♥♥♥♥ed up the build up to any scary parts. The random sounds where the only thing that kinda scared me. And you can't even open any doors normally. It sais 'Click to open the door' but I have to click like 20 times before it finally opens. When I'm super bored I'll play this again and finish it. Maybe the end makes it worth the money.~2/10~			"

Warning : This is a jumpscare horror game! Beware! It’s evil.The Achievement Man: Shadow WardNote :I’d idled for cards for about 3-4 hours so my actual playtime is less than what Steam shows.Benefits :▲ This is actually a real horror game. I mean it. This one is sp00ky for real. Not like the other crap on Steam. Scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me more than once.▲ There’s a story. The game's description says it's a true one. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥▲ Cheap. I got it at 50% off, if I remember correctly.▲ Achievements.▲ Trading cards.Drawbacks :▼ I died two times, the second time when I pressed load I encountered a black screen and had to restart the game. I was literally at the finish line. :/ It happened after a while again.▼ HatMan appeared right in front of me and there was nowhere to run. It was death at first sight. I mean it was unavoidable. I had to die. Glitch?▼ At late game HatMan appears in front of you. Sometimes just around the corner. It’s really hard to avoid him and there’s an achievement to beat the game without saving. How the ♥♥♥♥ is one supposed to do that?Conclusion :It’s not a perfect game but for 1 euro I’d say it’s decent enough. The fact that it’s actually scary is reason enough to give it a positive review. Proceed playing at your own risk.			"

												Well the dev added me and gave me this for free so I feel like I should be nice and give him a good review on this but I also want to be honest because this is one of the worst games I have played in a long time. Before I say anything else I can definitely say that I fully appreciate the time and talent of the people who make games, good or bad, because it isn't easy. To the game's credit it had no technical issues and controlled and performed very smoothly. There is no in-game vsync so I had to force it through Nvidia control panel, but no biggie. Unless I missed it, there is also no mouse sensitivity option so I had to lower it in my razer synapse but also no big deal. Although I am not a fan of adventure games I felt like I owed it to this guy to try his game and give it my honest opinion. The game lacks heavily in detail (basically none) and overall production value. The graphics are a major turn off. The game was very, very bland and very boring. The graphics look like pre Half-Life 1 and the environment is almost empty, only adorned with a few tables and a radio, a few beds in some rooms, sinks and toilets, a few things on the walls, and nothing else. It is very plain and mostly empty. I think the game repeats on itself, meaning there was no end as I moved in a direction through doors and hallways and the environment kept repeating. A piece of ceiling fell down with a scary music que eventually so I guess if you wander enough more things happen. Really though I'm not sure. Three times I encountered a black ghost (Bill Cosby from Ghost Dad I think) with a BOO! cartoon halloween style face and the game just popped up the dead menu, showing restart and quit. Nothing happened, just dead and menu screen. I do not know how the black figure is triggered, or why, or how to avoid him if I see him, or what the point of the game is or what exactly I am supposed to be doing, and overall don't care to see the answer to any of those inquiries. Note: I read that you just go around and collect journal pages and avoid the black figure and the game can be beat in like 30 minutes. That could have saved me a lot of words in my review.Out of 50+ installed games, this game just can't hold an audience with me anymore. 20 minutes was more than enough time spent on this. Although I dislike adventure games, I have played a few out there that are similarly priced (when on sale which is often if you know where to look) that are far superior in every aspect. Namely Outlast. Where this game would be a 3/10 Outlast would be a 8/10, easily trumping this game in every possible aspect.This game is so depressingly void of any real substance in terms of graphics/visual content and gameplay that it is what truly makes it scary. Imagine the inside of a cardboard box with a few miniature doll house chairs and tables and beds set up in it and that is what this game looks like.Thanks for the game. Sorry that it completely blows!			"

												The game feels more like a lighthearted outlast but has a really spooky feel to it. its a very good game with randomized rooms Pros: theme is nice and grapics look great, randomized rooms is perfect, voice acting is very great cons: the lighting is a bit obscure and a bit off sometimes the flashlight would flicker with the flickering lights and some of the shadows looked a bit disoriented7.5/10 if the lighting was a bit better id give it a solid 8 but this is a really good game if you love horror  "

												Please for the love of god DO NOT BUY THIS GAME thankfully I got it in a bundle that madde it free along with two other games. The games voice acting is laughable and the overall quality of the game is bad the ""shadowman"" or floating preist as i call him is not scary and the shadow people are just floating black blobs of nothing. The premise of the game is to find your lost daughter in a mental hospital? And get her to the saftey of the real world but in reality it's just relentless running around listening for pages of her diary. Even after findiing them there is another five pages to find. The whole game gives off the ""this game had no effort put into it and was made in ten minutes"" vibe. Overall if you want this terrible terrible game go ahead no-one is stoping you but just know that is a bad waste of your 79p. personally I would rate a -10/10			"

Thank you to the senpai studios for the free review copy.We live in an awesome time where small teams (and in many cases, one person) can create indie games and share them with the world. I love indie games. The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is obviously a labor of love for senpai studios, and I highly encourage them to keep doing what they are doing. There is alot of promise in this work, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game. What I can offer is some constructive critiscm. 1. While there are minute differences, it shares all too much with the Slenderman series. I fault that series for the same things found here - the mechanic it is built on is too simple, and the gimmick wears off quickly. That game concept works best as phone or tablet games. To explain further - finding book pages while avoiding a ghost is boring. Maybe if you added RPG-like elements and extended gameplay? Criticism should always be supported with possible options for a fix, IMO.2. Graphics are bland, at best. If you cannot make it hyper-realistic, I would try to go for a retro look. What you have here is something that falls in the middle, and ultimately just looks like every other basic FPS game. I would bet this was made in some GML or game making program (I don't believe senpai studios actually built those wheelchairs sprite by sprite). Once again, I am just trying to seed ideas.3. Maybe get rid of the voice acting, and just add captions.4. Make the Hat Man scarier, and much faster. Maybe make his 'darkness' totally creep and cover your entire view. As-is, he feels like a polygon on a rail.5. I would do something risky - everything that is currently in this game has been done before. In many cases, it has been done better before. Maybe add split-screen co-op where the second player plays as the Hat Man. Might make for a good couch co-op romp. Who knows?Thank you for reading the above ideas, and thank you again to senpai studios for the free copy. I seriously commend you for seeing the complete developemental process to finish. Not many can actually do that. Keep up the hard work. For my Steam friends - pass on this one. Peace,-Ryan			"

 ""I'm a Gamer and I'll die as a Gamer""  English Review I know I didn't played too much, that's because I normally don't like Survival Horror Games, especially the ones that don't scare me, but this one, well I can almost say that the reason behind why I didn't played more was because I didn't wanted to die of fright...It could have some kind of tutorial I don't know I've never played a survival horror that much so I don't know if they teach the player the basic of the game, I think it could teach things like, where could I save the game, what means when there's people whispering, how to ""scare away"" the ""monster"" (if that's possible)...The graphics are ok, it's nothing ultra realistic, but isn't ugly too (sometimes there's some graphical glitches like walls and/or objetcs fully ""lighted"" in total dark but it's probably my ultra lower end PC). Reason of death, he met the Hat Man, and he absorbed his soul  ""Sou Gamer e morrerei como Gamer""  Análise em Português - BR Eu sei que eu não joguei muito, isso é porque normalmente eu não gosto de jogos de survival horror, especialmente aqueles que não me assustam, mas este, bem, eu quase posso dizer que a razão por que eu não jogou mais foi porque eu não queria morrer de susto...Poderia ter algum tipo de tutorial sei lá, eu nunca joguei tanto assim um survival horror, então eu não sei se eles ensinam ao jogador o básico do jogo, mas acho que poderia ensinar coisas como, onde eu poderia salvar o jogo, o que significa que quando tem pessoas sussurrando, como ""assustar"" o ""monstro"" (se isso for possível)...O gráfico é ok, não é nada ultra-realista, mas também não é feio (às vezes aparece uns glitches gráficos tipo paredes e/ou objetcs totalmente ""iluminados"" em um lugar todo escuro, mas provavelmente é o meu PC ultra low end). Motivo da morte, ele conheceu o homem do chapéu, e ele absorveu sua alma  "

												     An incredible game with a tear-jerking story. The graphics are very pleasent to look at, including the beautiful mountains and scenery outside the windows. This game is also the most terrifying experience. The Hat Man-- played by Adam Sandler-- is the very giver of nightmares. When you finish the game, you (spoiler alert) see your daughter-- which is played by Nicole Arbor-- lays in her bed (jk it friccin sucks).			"

												I can't explain why, but I love this one. I really like the mechanics, I like the way the levels and rooms are randomly generted and attached, forming this crazy ever-changing maze. I like the slender-like goals, with improved mechanics. I think the sound design is awesome. I would like to se a graphical upgrade, though. If this were running with a AAA game engine, it would be really excellent. Anyway, if you like some cheap scares, this is a good one to choose.			"

												You can ask enough experts to make a review of this game by rating it with numbers and by taking a look at the similarity of other games to this game. but if you are a normal human being like me, and you didnt play every single horror game and/or didnt see every jumpscare in the world...then this is a scary game my friend. you will probably like the scariness but never play it again untill a friend asks u what this is. 8/8 m8			"

												Hatman confronts the ultimate threat against the city he has been sworn to protect. The Scarecrow returns to congeal an imposing array of super villains, including The Penguin, Two-Face and Harley Quinn, to summarily destroy The Dark Knight. The game introduces Rocksteady's uniquely-designed imagining of the Hatmobile drivable for the first time in the franchise. Hatman: Shadow Ward offers gamers a complete Hatman experience as they rip through the streets and soar across the skyline of the iconic Gotham City.			"

												This is as bad as it gets. I'm amazed that some people would review this game positively. The graphics are horrrible and the game runs sluggish even on a decent system (FX 8350, GeForce GTX 660). Overall it looks like an unfinished game or something you would create with a game creator utility. Even though it only cost a few cents, I've requested a refund. People should actually be paid moral damages for playing this even for a few minutes.			"

												I know this game is cheap, but that fact doesnt mean that the developer should not try to make it right. After 100 min of playthrough i did find only one bug which was just a minor problem ( in the beginning of the game i couldnt pick up the diary from the floor for no apparent reason, restart fixed it ), but the problem is somewhere else.You are basicaly a parent who is looking for his/her ( you can play for mother or father ) daughter in a mental instituation, there is absolutely no indication why she was there in a first place, but hey it doesnt matter, right? So what happens that after you get into her room everything change into a weird halucination or you are put in some different dimension, who knows and its up to you find your daughter...The thing is that this game is a lot as a Slender man in its gameplay, you are looking for a lost pages from the daughter diary, sometimes there are some items, but that is essencialy it. The one and the biggest plus is that this game is randomly generated, which brings a replaybality, and as far as i see it is quite effective in how it is build, the main problem here is the main villain, the Hat man is for one absolutely awful, he could not scare you even if you would the biggest chicken in the world and for worse he just making very cheap random apparations which prevents you to do anything, and that is most annoying thing, the game doesnt even follow it own rules where in the diary you are told that putting off a flashlight and crouch will make him go away, well that doesnt work, i waited like this 10 minutes and he just stands there like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so forced game over. And thats the thing, really often it happens that you will get in the hall where is floor missing and you cant cross and right in that moment the♥♥♥♥♥appear and you cant do anything about it, i lost my progress like this like thousand times and when you have achievments that says do it without saving this will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off...The graphics are very simple, music non existing, sounds try to jump scare you all the time, movement reminds me sailing on the boat but it is playable, i have to give a credit for a voice acting, its not great but also its not awful and actually i found this good for such a cheap game, it seems that they carred...Overal, this is a game which you can buy, but i hardly find any reason why, the only plus is the price and random generating but that will hardly do for a long time, i will play more just for the sake of achievments, but after that i will gladly forget it...

Randomly generated map with repeated rooms.2. Not so good voice acting except for the daughter.3. Graphics is quite demanding for how it looks.4. Repetitive jumpscare events.5. Wasn't able to find any save function.Recommended to:1. Anyone that has an above average performing PC.2. Really interested to the story since it's based on true events.3. Fans of the survival-horror genre.Not recommended to:1. Anyone that has an somewhat average performing PC.2. Anyone who, as well, dislikes all the things I mentioned.			"

												This game isnt the prettiest, the scariest, the most well-written, or even very good. Having said that, man did I have fun playing this. The Hat Man isnt particularly scary, but that didnt stop me from jumping almost every time that stupid guy with  his mouth agape and that dumb hat came rolling up on me. If you enjoy the, ""run around in the dark finding letters and hiding from creatures,"" types of games, then this is definitely a fun one to play. I rolled my eyes so hard at the credits hidden in the game though. Not sure what the developers were thinking with that mess. Also, the voice acting is amazingly awful and fantastic at the same time.

			The Hat Man: Shadow Ward Gameplay for Mac OS/Steam. Based on a true story, discover the horror of the Canton insane asylum as you attempt to rescue your daughter.		

I have to say I've downloaded quite a bit of paid games so far on steam & this has to be one of my least favorites. The gameplay mechanics were sloppy for me & the story is non-existed or empty. It can be creepy in the beginning but after about 20 minutes you quickly become accostomed to the evil spirit & find it more of an annoyance when it's chasing you.I only recommend if you can play a demo first or if you LOVE chase/horror games where you have to pick up items before it finds you.

												Once upon a time, 4 boys and Ethan secretly wanked off each other, after getting erect we decided to purchase this game for 19p, after a bit of laughter and cleaning the mess we caused we finally gained some courage and played this game however we soon realised how scary this game truely is. After taking 8 minutes of our time (split between 4 boys who were still trying to clean the♥♥♥♥♥out of their mouths exept for Ethan who was hiding under the covers as he was still aftraid of his parents finding out about our hobbies), we sadly couldn't complete this fantastic masterpiece which truly is greater than all of the hentai that we have previously watched in the past because of a simple reason... the game was 2 sp00ky 4 us. Overall i would give this game 10 underage boys out of 10.Pros: - Very good voice acting - Great spelling/grammer (its ax not axe) - realistic physics, breaking the door with th ax - variety of missions - great rooms and objects inside - 60fps gameplay and very good graphics - Very good story, no loop holes - Loved the premature baby on the front of the book :3Cons: - The ghost is to scary and isnt child friendly - almost to realistsic - Aaaaaaaaaahhh (triggered) - Would like online multiplayer ( with guns like CoD) - Hentai related to the Hat Man (mmmmmmm) - Make monster not look like Michaels dad - Make the monster look  more like rick ross and playable character (boy/girl) look like Bob Ross.

												Terrible gamepad controls (inverted move forward/backward, inverted look up/down, no option to invert), made it unplayable to me.  You have to do all controller mapping yourself, and can't quite cover everything, but was easy to configure.  Keyboard+mouse controls seem standard, and you can remap keys easily in options.  I still muddled through the beginning of the game trying both gamepad & keyboard/mouse, and really couldn't tell what on earth I was to do next, possibly control issues blinding me to what I could or should do.  I walked everywhere through a sparse environment, nothing was interesting, and nothing to do.  Given I was already fighting with the controls, there was nothing appealing worth it.  I actually thought it would be a cheesy kind of fun, but was just unplayable to me due to controls and game design.  (0/5 stars + trading cards)			"

												For starters, this game is an indie horror game. I usually have an open mind about indie games, and not pay any mind to Steam reviews. I decided to try it out right now, and I wish I hadn't even bothered trying it out. Yes, I don't have much time spent on the game, but it's so bad, I couldn't stand to waste more of my time with it. So, you are a parent of a child who goes missing in a mental asylum, and you go in to search for her. Little does the player's character know, the asylum has nobody in it, except for the Hat Man and his Shadow People. The main objective is to run through the asylum, collecting journal pages and avoiding the Hat Man and his Shadow People. Yes, this already seems like a slender man clone, and I can tell you, it essentially is. The two differences between the two are: 1) The map randomly generates as you go, so you can easily get lost. 2) There are obstacles in the way of you progressing, so there are puzzles in this nightmare of a game. All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but it was really wasted, just like my time playing it.			"

												I don't usually play this sort of game, but the developer added me and gave me a free copy so I gave it a go. You can tell by my play time that I didn't put much time into it, because I'm not into that whole ""collect notes while something scary sometimes stalks you"" genre that this game is a part of, like Slender and Huntsman: The Orphenage. But at the same time, I'm not sure exactly how much time there is to be put into it; the game has 3 achievements for finishing the game in 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and an hour, and of the apparent 22 notes I found 11 in my second attempt. I couldn't figure out how to save, but it doesn't seem like the game is long enough to justify needing it anyways. The map is visually interesting, at least.Overall, it's about exactly what you would expect for a $5 game. I'm only giving it a yes recommendation because there's no ""indifferent"" option; if you're not into the whole note-collecting genre, consider this a ""no"" recommendation. If you're looking for a real horror game, look elsewhere. But if you've played Slender and Huntsman and all those other games and are looking for something new and don't have very high standards (I mean, you really can't have THAT high of standards if you played Huntsman: The Orphenage), you may as well give this one a try too. It's basically the same thing, only now it has a hat.			"

												I love the horror genre and don't scare easily so I figured 0.49 wasn't much money to risk if I didn't like it. This is amazingly atmospheric and so engaging. I set the resolution to 1920x1080 and quality to Fantastic, turned out the lights and turned up my headphones. The graphics and audio are actually really good. The game has a dark, gritty feel to it so I'm guessing that's where all the bad quality reviews are coming from. The controls are wasd standard by default, but you can customize them to your liking. Movement felt pretty fluid with no lag. I became completely engrossed had more ""wtf was that???"" moments than I've had in quite awhile. When the HatMan ate my soul (on toast with jam?) and I turned on the lights to find out who put poo in my shorts, I was amazed that only 12 minutes had passed. I spent more time petting my cat to calm down than I did playing the game. No, I wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it, but I feel great about what I did pay. Do yourself a favor and get this.			"

Early Access Review
								I started off as a Kickstarter backer with the Pre-Alpha and I have to admit even though the game back then was ""Collect these pages and then run for your life"" the atmosphere was more than enough to keep me curious in the games development. Then suddenly the game morphed between versions, BOOM! story line, key items, darker environment. I was suprised to say the least. I strongly recommend this game if you are willing to deal with a few minor glitches. . .if not I recommend wating until the final version drops and then getting the game. Happy hunting!			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Well I may not have played this game very much, but I can safely say thats because of how terrifying it is. I end up playing through slow cause of the atmosphere. This usually doesnt happen to me, but this game managed to do it. Good job.3/15/2015Ok so now the game has been updated a bit. The game has gotton more unsettling than last time which is good. Before I may have thought it was kinda scary, nut now even with the update its more unsettling than anything. The noises are creepy and that hat man still as persistant as ever. Better item usage is good as well.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is utterly terrifying. The first time I played this I thought it would be just one of those boring repetitive jump scare games, but I was wrong. The build up towards your death is the most terrifying; not the death itself, as the loud ghostly noises, the creepy whispering when you get close to the journals,  the sounds of the hat man crawling above you; rattling the ceiling panels or a wheel chair ghostly pushed makes you think that he's right around the corner, behind you or in a door way which keeps you on edge throughout. The thing that I would like to be improved on is when the hat man finally pops up, as for me it wasn't that scary since he appeared at the end of the corridor where I could easily see him and didn't even chase me. So to improve on this you should make him appear from behind you,  grab you through a missing celling panel or try and grab you though a toilet, as there are so many of them. Also it would be awesome if you added flares to light up rooms that you don't want to go in and make the torch flicker or go out to add even more scares. Just to say this is an early access game; it won't be a fully perfect game, so don't buy this if you’re looking for a finished game and just wait until it comes out. But honestly this game is so worth getting if you love indie horror games and is just amazing, to say that it’s an early access game.			"

								If you're looking for a new Horror game that presents a great atmosphere and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, The Hat Man: Shadow Ward just might be for you. Taking inspiration from Amnesia: The Dark Descent's ambiance, puzzle/collection-based objectives from a variety of games, and cues from psudo-folklore-derived games like Slenderman, The Hat Man has a lot of familiar and tried-and-true aesthetics while presenting new gameplay elements that are quickly becoming extremely popular for video games, especially in the Horror genre--namely, that it's very replayable. The map generates randomly, and if you stray too far from any one spot, it will have changed completely when you try to return to it. If there's one thing that the Horror genre in general relies on, it's atmosphere. As a music composer/writer, I can say with great confidence that what I say next cannot be easily refuted, which is thus: A game that desires to scare, unsettle, unnerve, and frighten, must take great care in creating an experience that tips the audience off-balance, makes them lose their footing, and just when they think they're back on their feet, you pull the rug out from under them. If a Horror game cannot disturb and create suspense, it is operating completely wrong. Now, of course, your mileage may vary, and various games may not neccessarily scare you. But, for me, anyway, The Hat Man does a great job at creating suspense and keeping me on my toes; like watching the fishing reel scene from Jaws, you'd be utterly amazed at what happens when you just focus on the ambience and the sound effects. In truth, they can sometimes be quite scarier than what's actually trying to scare you. In this regard, I think the developers of this game chose a great collection to work with. This game relies on building suspense and atmosphere rather than relying on conventional jump scares like most other Horror games. In fact, there's only maybe a handful of them in this game, if you can even call some of them so. A refreshing and welcome change of pace, in my opinion.All-in-all, a fun game. I can't wait to see what is added and done in the final release. If it's great already, I can scarcely imagine what will happen in the future. To the developers, I say great job, and keep at it.			"

								Absolutely terrifying!The atmosphere is so thick with terror and the desire to just not progress further. It's actually to the point where I need to conjure up bravey to press on in certain circumstances.There are a couple of things that I absolutele WISH you guys in the developement team could consider:(these are all things that I expected to happen because of my paranoid nature in-game)1: Sound lures the Hat Man to you vicinity (Also encourages stealth and focus in a very trying atmosphere)2: The ability to possibly see him on top of the fallen ceiling-spaces (to encourage a panic causing possibly more trouble)3: Footsteps, which either i couldn't hear in all the terror, or they just haven't been added yet. (maybe a good echo depending on the acoustics of the room too!)4: A reflection in a mirror that perhaps isn't broken (which could show the Hat Man behind you on occasion)5: Perhaps a darker atmosphere to emphasize how important the flashlight or matches are to the player.6: See the Hat Man PASS a corridor ahead. Where he completely crosses the threashhold of an intersection in front of you. (I have never seen him do that, he's only ever crossed halfway and turned to run at me)7: Seeing the Hat Man peek out from corners (just a little touch to mess with the player)8: Maybe even getting captured by the Hat Man only to wake up in a completely unfamiliar area without the flashlight?9: upon opening a door, he would be on the other side, to attack you; could directly correlate to the above suggestion to where opening doors could lead to your capture and loss of the flashlight (this in my opinion would make players who experience this more likely to not want to open a door in the future, leading to more gameplay)These are all just things that have crossed my mind during my TINY time of gameplay and while watching countless let's plays. Also in my opinion, it's the little things that most don't notice that are the most terrifying.Because when someone DOES notice something small- that's not actually a trick of the eye, then they WILL continue to see other small things that might not all be genuinely coded. All in all, I give the game 9.5/10 terror-induced-crapsI hope to see more of the small things in this BIG game!-TJ Stratford			"

								So far I'm loving this game. It does remind me a bit of Slender, but without the annoying mechanic that fuzzes over the camera .Graphics: 7/10: It has a very creepy and proper feel to it, but the graphics can get a bit old after a while. Granted it's in beta, so hopefully during official release it will have been touched up. The monster has a rather nice graphics effect when it gets closer and can be seen, granted the ACTUAL Hat Man, is rather hard to make out within the fog till he's right up on you.Sound/Music: 6/10 The sounds and audio are great at first, but after a while they stop being scary, especially when you're having trouble finding pages and are feeling frustrated. The heartbeat mechanic of Hat Man getting closer, is a rather awesome way to tell how close he is and act accordingly, but during the last several pages, when he is popping up all the time (in some of my videos like ever 30 seconds or less), it can get extremely annoying as it becomes all you hear. Still it's in beta, hopefully that'll be polished a bit to where he doesn't pop up so often when you're being super cautious or it isn't as deafening. This is a game you have to play with the sound though, otherwise finding pages will be EXTREMELY hard.Gameplay: 7?/10: I put the ? because I may changed it and move it up, at the present point, I still haven't beaten the game (13 out of ?? pages), though I've finally started to get the hang of it. Hat man is a nice enemy as you can sneak by him and even juke around him (this requires some skill), the stealth works very nicely in the game and leads to some funny survival moments. As you collect more, it seems that real traps start to appear (or there is just a giant pitfall to your death at one point). My only issue with the gameplay is that it's not entirely clear what somethings are for, namely the Matches...I've found Matches, I think they unlock more pages (as I get stuck on 7 pages, find a box and boom I start finding more), maybe a tiny bit of clarity on that...granted could be a journal page I haven't gotten to read yet. Overall: 7/10 likely to improve up with future edit. It's a good game, if you like this type of game. It could be a little more clear on some issues and have some audio configuration options (there is no way to effect the sound which means if you record, you'll be lower the games sound level during editing). I'd say buy it, especially before it gets closer to finished and increases in price.			"

								Great game especially for being in beta still! This game has you scared right from the second you enter it. I've played Resident Evil and Clocktower and this is the first game that actually makes me jump and freak out! It's a simple gather pages and items and escape while The Hat Man chaces you throughout an insane asylum. The rooms change when you walk a certain distance so you can't even go back the way you came, it's awesome!((Spoilers))I'll be streaming it on twitch as much as I can: http://www.twitch.tv/thehazefactorI also have completed the game where you can see the gameplay at my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiS7C7XsOmPBOhtDI4aiWQ "

								I started off as a Kickstarter backer with the Pre-Alpha and even though the game back then was pretty much an original slender-type game but with the moving 'maze' walls back then, the atmosphere amazing in suspense and sounds in development through the updates kept me intrigued and proud. I have followed the game since Pre-Alpha and earned my 'Game designer' credit through tests, feedback, and new ideas throughout development.This game has vastly improved since the original release, making it more unique and an incredibly scary game! I'd recommend this to anybody with a strong heart and an interest in scary survival games, purely for the terrifying atmosphere and suspense!Cheers and gg.			"

								Hat Man=Actually a really well made game! My first impression of the game was that once you get in to the shadow realm or whatever you want to call it, very creepy and atmospheric. Like a lot of other horror games that have been released recently, it's Slenderman essentially. Run around with the threat of a being always present and trying to kill you. That does'nt make the game boring though, don't get me wrong! The game is actually good! It has it's own little story in which you are trying to find your daughter who has ""dissappeared"". All the notes you pick up are hand written notes by your daughter which give you a really cool back story! So if you are killed by The Hat Man, (who is actually very creepy), you have that feeling of, ""Hey! I want to go back in there, and find out what happened to my daughter!"" The game is very interesting and actually makes you want to complete the game and get the story, instead of some Slender games in which you just collect the notes for the sake of getting notes. Overall I give the game a 7.5/10. Great atmosphere, the sounds are really nice and creepy, and the plot behind it makes you want more. Good game.

								The hat man is a horror game, which upon first inspection seems rather unfrefined.However, the game itself provides the user with a disturbed atmosphere, with both the sound and visual design being almost flawless.Although the user is not currently provided with a clear understanding of objective (we thought it ended after collecting 5 notes) the game looks like it has a lot of potential should the developers continue to work on this issue.THe hat man himself, however, is a dissapointing, anti-climactic and abrupt end to the game. The model quality lacks and you end up being more afraid of wheelchairs and lights than the hat man himself.PLEASE. PLEASE. Work on the Hat Man, the user should be afraid of him, they should not be able to wander the map for almost an hour without seeing him. Perhaps using mechanics similar to 'One Late Night' would suit the gameplay.I hope you take this into consideration, I look forward to seeing how the game develops.TL;DR Great atmosphere but the Hat Man isn't all he is hyped up to be. It's not just about the review anymore.			"

												I like this game it plays along the same lines as slender. The Hat Man is a cool monster and the enviorment is awesome what is ruining the game for me is that the person you play talks and sounds way to calm for the sistation they are in. About a minute in to the game you are pulled in to The Hat Man's world and he calmly says something along the lines of wow now you have my attention. It breaks the emersion and kinda kills the horror aspect of the game. another line after you just axed down a door was Oh I never knew I was so good at breaking things. It just seems very out of place and would of been better left out altogether. It could also be alittle darker Hat Man is a shadow being or something and the games called shadow ward but some hallways are bright like I didn't even need a flash light bright and when I saw Hat Man in those places he just looked comical. Don't get me wrong this is a good game just needs alittle more polish and it could be a great game. I found out they have a thing to shut off the parents voice over. I highly recomend doing that.

								Backed this project awhile ago, played the Pre-Alpha and pre-Steam Beta, plus this new release.PROS:+Atmospheric (creepy background music)+Tense (Being chased! AHH!)+Mythos (Backstory is interesting)+Terrifying Antagonist (LOVE the idea behind the Hat Man)+Engine (I actually go ""ARG! Not THIS room again)CONS:-Pacing needs work (Finding pages can be hard)-More types of scares needed (too many wheelchairs)Overall I love this game. It's a work in progress, so they listen to people.The CONS are minor things, bound to be edited and tweaked. The concept of changing rooms is a great way to keep the game fresh. Very proud to be a part of this game's development!SHOULD YOU BUY IT: YES.SCORE: 8/10, with an easy 10/10 when finished!			"

Early Access Review
								Very good game. Extremely good. Builds up the suspense almost so that I cant handle it. I would be walking down the hallway with my heart pumpin and just wanting to quit because the suspense was just so... suspensey.. yes thats a thing just go with it. Go ahead and buy this, just keep in mind that its still a beta game. I mean I kinda fell off the map one time while trying to run away but its still good.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was brilliant from the very start of the Alpha test!! (I know I only have 8 mins so far on Steam but I have about 7 hours on the Alpha and Beta tests) I strongly recommend trying it out. It is atmospheric and being chased by a shadow person is more than enough incentive to not get caught.The atmosphere is amazing, sounds, quietly speaking pages, strange whispers that make you turn around and the map that is never the same.Good luck!

												""Scariest Game of 2014.""Alien Isolation.  Five Nights at Freddy's.  PT.  Evil Within.  Neverending Nightmares.  Among the Sleep.  Outlast: Whistle Blower.  All far better than this as there is at least one thing scary about them.  And before you argue about budget and indie studios, some developers make games which can do more with less, like NeM.  This game can't do a thing with assets so generic the subtitles and save screens are in default Arial font.You wander the same halls, looking at the same four bits of furniture, ignoring the one blood splatter that appears everywhere, picking up the same journal pages, solving the same puzzle over and over by just wandering around until something shiny appears on the floor (e.g. use hammer on lock, use axe on board that's barely attached to a wall holding a door shut).  All the while the Hat Man, looking like a cheap Halloween decoration, floats around at the speed of smell and poses little to no threat or takes on the form of an incredibly-bored sounding little girl ghost.I haven't been this bored by a ""spooky"" game in quite some time.  Your time and money are better spent elsewhere.			"

Not to mention there is very little horror in the game itself. Achievements are broken and have been broken, some machanics are mentioned but are nonexistent. Save your money and your breath.			"

												Imagine Slender, but he's really slow, and just walks at you in a tiny room while you pick up pages laying on the ground 3 feet away from each other. This is the intro to hat man. After ""finding"" three pages you leave the room and walk through an endless hallway labyrinth of the same falling light over and over again and a slowly moving wheelchair which can only be decribed as exactly what I expected from this game, where you have to actively seek out and approach the ""monster"" to lose, let alone actually find the remaining two pages. Luckily, you get to choose the gender of your character, so there's that. #SteamRefunds			"

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a game where you go to an insane asylum to search for your missing daughter. The gameplay consists of collecting notebook pages that tell the poorly written, generic story, and running from a flying halloween decoration. It's not scary, it's not fun, and it's not impressive. I would only recommend this if you are very young or very drunk.			"

												""Experience the scariest game of 2014""Yeah, sure.Extremely amateurish. The graphics and map design look like those really poor add-on campaigns teenagers create for FPS. Some of the voice audio recordings (especially the second diary) sound like they were recorded in someone's kitchen. You basically just wander aound to find diary pages in a silent hill rip-off environement and once in a while you turn around and BAM a terrible looking shadow people gets you and that'sit, game over. 10/10 for whoevr created the audio soundscape though, that part was indeed creepy.

												I like this game, I was hoping it might be a bit longer and have a bit more of a story, but it's more like a part-story and part-slender kind of, he's chasing you game. Still a good game though, had me freaked out when I saw it the first time. I recommend it, at the moment it's on sale for 20 cents, definitely buy it, but for the regular price $5, I'd still recommend it but only if you like the type of game I described.			"

												Do good Graphics make a game good? If you answerd yes the this probably is going to disapoint. on the other hand i this game doesnt need them its really quit good at what it sets out to do. The feeling of being chased  and the opresive nature of the enviroment and add in the fact that the rooms change leaves you really feeling alone and very much lost in a nightmare. This all ads up to a good horror game.  It could be great if the develpers keep going in the right direction. UPDATE Well since update 1.3 the game no longer works i have no control over the charecter and cant move i am unable to change control scheame from xbox360 controller. please fix this as i do like this game. Well problem has now been fixed by a user on the forums so thank you sir i can now enjoy this game again.			"

												This game is utterly horrific. That someone would make and release this game is terrifying. This game is so horrible, that is truly the scary part. Did you ever have a time, when you would save a game, during an epic fight, and right before you got hit and died, you saved the game. You had to keep reloading and reloading, the save until the enemy missed you, and then you ran off and escaped. Sometimes it could take 5 or 10 reloads, before you finally got the lucky miss. Well thats the first 5 minutes of this game.			"

												I got this game for 19 cents. It has to be worth at least 8 dollars though. This game is pretty awesome, I don't see how people think that this game just copied the slenderman because the concept is entirely different. The amazing thing about this game is that some how the game randomizes itself, as you are playing. Not just the spawing of the enemies or where the things you need to find are but the entire stinking map. You can seriously walk through one halway practically forever becasue it constantly is changing and building the areas of the map. You can leave one area and go straight and end up right back where you were. I would be impossible to get this game memorized because everything besides the begining and very end is the same what so ever.This game is worth every penny and a heck of a lot more. 9/10.			"

												Bought this game for 19 cents...best laxative I've ever had!Heh, no, in all seriousness though, the game is pretty good but it could definitely use some work. For example, how tf do you save?! Also, there's no way to tell if the game auto saved or not. The first time I was captured, it was toward the begining and it restarted me in front of the journal. Then, I collected two whole sets of pages, listened to them both, got captured again and it started me back in front of the journal. Really?! I have to do that all over again?! You gotta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me! I quit the game right then. And it doesn't help that it's hard to determine where you've been and where you haven't. Everything is like a maze! I understand that being a horror game, it's designed to build tension, but c'mon! It's very unforgiving knowing that if I get captured, I'm gonna have to do this crap all over again! Some kind of map would be nice. Or at least grant me the option to save when ever I want, or at the very least quicksave. I think it's pretty safe to say that no one likes starting from the beginning, (or close to it) that's usually when people start to lose interest. I'll give the game a positive rating, since I definitely got my 19 cents worth. But if I paid full price it'd be thumbs down all the way, without a doubt...			"

												Very clever. I can not play at this stage had headphones on tried a couple of times and a black ghost or something kept freaking me out goosebumps etc - I spent more on crap under a dollar that is nowhere near as well choreographed with sound effects (huming, screams)  do not see why people complaining, obviously a small dev and they are not asking much for cheap thrills. I get scared easy and hate horror, the mental asylum aspect is reason bought the game and will buy other mental asylum type games here on steam. [no, not zombie horror...impressionable, thought provoking old scenes and lack of care to people like this entails, specifically mental health - in this lack of mass production dev can help to some extent][the dollar you had left to waste on steam - no dissapointment of course under this pretence. What you expecting big make zombie games ? Battlefield ? - I like the vulnerable feel]I am a bit of scardey cat when comes to direct horror, so hopefully I can try to play again looks promising enough for price. Interesting what seen any ways. Would of liked to see more attributes like active nurses, people lining up for medications etc, real mental asylum, perhaps even becomming the mental health patient etc with all the struggles associated.

												After the most recent update I was asked to come back and check the game out again. This update waqs a very good thing for the game, however the game itself is still not very good. Start with the pros, few as they are, I guess.Pros:Procedurally generated map, each map is different and will change if you decide to double back.False alarms, when the Hat Man arrives you will be able to hear your own heartbeat as a warning, and unless I am mistaken, smoetimes you can hear your heartbeat when he isn't there. nice false alarm to keep me from lingering in one area for too long.Diary pages, the varous diary pages scattered about will tell you tiny bits about the Hat Man and things to do in game, like how to pass the pit of spikes or how to better hide from the Hat ManBetter preformence, game breaking lag issues from before the patch have gone away without me upgrading my computer, this means the devs fixed it. And that is kinda it for pros, not many that I can see. For cons here are mineCons: Crappy Hat Man AI, he can only move if you are not behind something. that means being 1% behind a doorway and even if he is 2 feet from you, he wont move to attack and just sit thereProcedurally generated, while each map si different, this is an issue. I can spend 2 minutes finding the bar needed to cross the spike pit one game, then it will take 10 minutes the next. At least SCP containment breach had SCP-914 to upgrade the cards.Rooms, there are about 14 types(roughly, not counting super large ones like the main hall and the hallways with different amounts of doors). The only thing that can change between them are things like wheelchairs that move when approched or broken X-ray projector machines. Some rooms even have 2 or more of the same thing, I saw a 3 way room that had 3 radios, one be each door.Hat Man, before this update, he would take a few seconds to entangle you before killing you, giving you a brief moment to run. now he just insta kills you like Slenderman does. More of a personal issue thoughDiary pages, while yes, they can help and give hints, it takes waaaaaayyyyyy too long to get that many. I found about 17 of them before I even decided to read them and saw(page 16 or 17 I think) one say how to pass the spike pit.Music, or lack there of. There are not even ambiant background music from what I can hear. Most of the sounds are scripted, like when the few working lights flicker and die, or when the predicatble wheelchair decides to go take a roll. This is more of a personal con as minor ambient music makes the feeling of unease this game needs more powerful.Lack of scares, After the first few encounters with the Hat Man the scariness goes away and the only thing that is left is the hope he wont appear because then you need to spend time getting away from him rather then hunting for pages to find out what to do next. No save points. Or if there are, I can't find them. Hat man spawning: Before I plyed off the planks to cross the spike pit, every single time(I do mean every, I counted 14 times over 13 runs, one run i did manage to escape past him) I enetered the spike room, the Hat man spawned in the room behind me, so either I had the crowbar and could escape, which I only had once and still died in another spike pit room due to the journal not puasing the game, or I died.Lots of cons here. Next is things of note that are not really good or bad, but that I want to mention.Item noise: Items like pages or other things like the axe or box of matches make noises. The pages sound like whispering and the other items are simmilar, but not exactly the same. The hearing range is large enough so that you can just walk down the hallway and if the page is in a room you can hear it from the hallway, making searching the rooms obsoleteLack of Shadow people: the devs and the diary talk aobut the ""shadow people"", yet they only spawn right at the begining after the dairy goes flying off. Wait about 15 seconds then just one will spawn and slowly walk towards you. As soon as you leave the room and pick the dairy cover up, they never appear again. I feel like they are just shoehorned in so that the devs can say ""Look! Ghost people! Aren't they scary cause their black and ghosts but not the hat Man!"". At least make them appear wandering the ward's hallways or something. Horrendous Voice acting: This isn't really an issue that can be fixed easily, as well as it canbe ignored by turning off voices in settings but I still wanted to mention it. Latern Head: If the Hat man is close to you(a room or so away) he opens his mouth and light comes from it, or it should. The inside is just a white tube, that when coupled with the shape of his hate, makes his head look like one of those camping lanterns. The humor from this nullifies any fear his arrival is suppose to bring for me but that is just me.Now that is over, final scores.  NOTE THAT 5/10 is AVARAGE! THIS DOES NOT MEAN 5/10 IS BAD, JUST AVARAGE!   Graphics: 4/10Story 2/10Horror 1/10Sounds 6/10*Grpahics are nothing special, not too bad thoughStory, if it could be called that, is meh. I feel the game would be better if it was taken out entirely, and yes, I know this is based on things people have supposidly seenHorror: Nonexisitant after the first encounter, that first encounter is the only thing saving it from a 0/10 score.Sound: The sounds sound good, and realisitc, however their timing and placement could use tons of work.My recomendations for the devs.  Add ambient background noise, something like the track ""A Cold Wind Blows"" by Kevin Sherwood on youtube. At least something like that would make the game more unsetttling. Fix Latern head please, as funny as it is, it needs to go for the horror to come back. Add more massive rooms, like the library the girl talked about. I would have loved to see a supermassive library that was 10 times larger then any other room in the game, with tower bookshelves. Plus the close quaters would make when the Hat Man arrives more threatening. Better AI. Fix the first con issue I mention. Or if you can, make him roam the halls and when he gets near you, make an indicator to hide and let the player peak from cover to see him stroll past. That would be really nice. Make usefull diary enteries, like how to get over the spike pit, easier to reach. Like make the spike pit page number 6, rather then 15+ Lastly is make some incentive for reading the diary. Were it not because I wanted to get the achivement, I would have never even opened the diary as it didn't seem interesting.Overall I give the game  a 3/10. It is defintly not the worst thing out there anymore, however it still feels like a poorly done Slender clone. And regardless of what they do to it, even with my recomendations, it is not worth 15 USD. 5$, maybe.			"

												There are a lot of little indie horror games. and there are a lot of bad ones. (ever heard of The House?) And then there's this one.Ok, honesty time. the ""hat man"" is cheesy looking, the voice work is mediocre to bad, the graphics are basic and the gameplay is straight up Slenderman 10 pages style. However! For five bucks, my girlfriend and I played a bit, enjoyed the cheesiness and got scared every time we saw the silly looking ghoul. It's a fun little nugget and if you wanna spend a couple of bucks for a b-movie horror experience this isn't half bad.Full disclosure, the team emailed me a key to play this game. Full FULL disclosure, I had already bought it with my own money when it was three times as expensive. (thanks though, guys! I gave the copy to a friend and she was very happy!) So after spending 15 bucks, i definitely say 5 is worth it.now that's fresh.			"

												My X-Box 360 controls are inverted.  Look up actually looks down.  Move forward actually moves backward.I looked at the discussion board to see if there was a fix or workaround, but all I saw were reports of others experiencing the same issue, plus lots of other reported bugs.I'll check back and re-review after the next update (if one is released.)

												The hat man, is by no means a scary game (for me), at best it makes me nervous for the simple fact that I may die and have to start over again. This game has come pretty far from the beta release when I started playing and is a fair challenge pretty similar to most slender games (Find pages and get out). Beware the shadow people, they will kill you just as quickly as the hat man, and they spawn in random locations. The game is still worth it and I would love to see titles from this producer in the future and see improvement inn their work. They have something going but they aren't 100% on track yet. Still a pretty good game.			"

												There are a lot of little indie horror games. and there are a lot of bad ones. (ever heard of The House?) And then there's this one.Ok, honesty time. the ""hat man"" is cheesy looking, the voice work is mediocre to bad, the graphics are basic and the gameplay is straight up Slenderman 10 pages style. However! For five bucks, my girlfriend and I played a bit, enjoyed the cheesiness and got scared every time we saw the silly looking ghoul. It's a fun little nugget and if you wanna spend a couple of bucks for a b-movie horror experience this isn't half bad.Full disclosure, the team emailed me a key to play this game. Full FULL disclosure, I had already bought it with my own money when it was three times as expensive. (thanks though, guys! I gave the copy to a friend and she was very happy!) So after spending 15 bucks, i definitely say 5 is worth it.now that's fresh.			"

												After the most recent update I was asked to come back and check the game out again. This update waqs a very good thing for the game, however the game itself is still not very good. Start with the pros, few as they are, I guess.Pros:Procedurally generated map, each map is different and will change if you decide to double back.False alarms, when the Hat Man arrives you will be able to hear your own heartbeat as a warning, and unless I am mistaken, smoetimes you can hear your heartbeat when he isn't there. nice false alarm to keep me from lingering in one area for too long.Diary pages, the varous diary pages scattered about will tell you tiny bits about the Hat Man and things to do in game, like how to pass the pit of spikes or how to better hide from the Hat ManBetter preformence, game breaking lag issues from before the patch have gone away without me upgrading my computer, this means the devs fixed it. And that is kinda it for pros, not many that I can see. For cons here are mineCons: Crappy Hat Man AI, he can only move if you are not behind something. that means being 1% behind a doorway and even if he is 2 feet from you, he wont move to attack and just sit thereProcedurally generated, while each map si different, this is an issue. I can spend 2 minutes finding the bar needed to cross the spike pit one game, then it will take 10 minutes the next. At least SCP containment breach had SCP-914 to upgrade the cards.Rooms, there are about 14 types(roughly, not counting super large ones like the main hall and the hallways with different amounts of doors). The only thing that can change between them are things like wheelchairs that move when approched or broken X-ray projector machines. Some rooms even have 2 or more of the same thing, I saw a 3 way room that had 3 radios, one be each door.Hat Man, before this update, he would take a few seconds to entangle you before killing you, giving you a brief moment to run. now he just insta kills you like Slenderman does. More of a personal issue thoughDiary pages, while yes, they can help and give hints, it takes waaaaaayyyyyy too long to get that many. I found about 17 of them before I even decided to read them and saw(page 16 or 17 I think) one say how to pass the spike pit.Music, or lack there of. There are not even ambiant background music from what I can hear. Most of the sounds are scripted, like when the few working lights flicker and die, or when the predicatble wheelchair decides to go take a roll. This is more of a personal con as minor ambient music makes the feeling of unease this game needs more powerful.Lack of scares, After the first few encounters with the Hat Man the scariness goes away and the only thing that is left is the hope he wont appear because then you need to spend time getting away from him rather then hunting for pages to find out what to do next. No save points. Or if there are, I can't find them. Hat man spawning: Before I plyed off the planks to cross the spike pit, every single time(I do mean every, I counted 14 times over 13 runs, one run i did manage to escape past him) I enetered the spike room, the Hat man spawned in the room behind me, so either I had the crowbar and could escape, which I only had once and still died in another spike pit room due to the journal not puasing the game, or I died.Lots of cons here. Next is things of note that are not really good or bad, but that I want to mention.Item noise: Items like pages or other things like the axe or box of matches make noises. The pages sound like whispering and the other items are simmilar, but not exactly the same. The hearing range is large enough so that you can just walk down the hallway and if the page is in a room you can hear it from the hallway, making searching the rooms obsoleteLack of Shadow people: the devs and the diary talk aobut the ""shadow people"", yet they only spawn right at the begining after the dairy goes flying off. Wait about 15 seconds then just one will spawn and slowly walk towards you. As soon as you leave the room and pick the dairy cover up, they never appear again. I feel like they are just shoehorned in so that the devs can say ""Look! Ghost people! Aren't they scary cause their black and ghosts but not the hat Man!"". At least make them appear wandering the ward's hallways or something. Horrendous Voice acting: This isn't really an issue that can be fixed easily, as well as it canbe ignored by turning off voices in settings but I still wanted to mention it. Latern Head: If the Hat man is close to you(a room or so away) he opens his mouth and light comes from it, or it should. The inside is just a white tube, that when coupled with the shape of his hate, makes his head look like one of those camping lanterns. The humor from this nullifies any fear his arrival is suppose to bring for me but that is just me.Now that is over, final scores.  NOTE THAT 5/10 is AVARAGE! THIS DOES NOT MEAN 5/10 IS BAD, JUST AVARAGE!   Graphics: 4/10Story 2/10Horror 1/10Sounds 6/10*Grpahics are nothing special, not too bad thoughStory, if it could be called that, is meh. I feel the game would be better if it was taken out entirely, and yes, I know this is based on things people have supposidly seenHorror: Nonexisitant after the first encounter, that first encounter is the only thing saving it from a 0/10 score.Sound: The sounds sound good, and realisitc, however their timing and placement could use tons of work.My recomendations for the devs.  Add ambient background noise, something like the track ""A Cold Wind Blows"" by Kevin Sherwood on youtube. At least something like that would make the game more unsetttling. Fix Latern head please, as funny as it is, it needs to go for the horror to come back. Add more massive rooms, like the library the girl talked about. I would have loved to see a supermassive library that was 10 times larger then any other room in the game, with tower bookshelves. Plus the close quaters would make when the Hat Man arrives more threatening. Better AI. Fix the first con issue I mention. Or if you can, make him roam the halls and when he gets near you, make an indicator to hide and let the player peak from cover to see him stroll past. That would be really nice. Make usefull diary enteries, like how to get over the spike pit, easier to reach. Like make the spike pit page number 6, rather then 15+ Lastly is make some incentive for reading the diary. Were it not because I wanted to get the achivement, I would have never even opened the diary as it didn't seem interesting.Overall I give the game  a 3/10. It is defintly not the worst thing out there anymore, however it still feels like a poorly done Slender clone. And regardless of what they do to it, even with my recomendations, it is not worth 15 USD. 5$, maybe.			"

												If you enjoyed the original Slender game, you'll probably enjoy this. There is a lot to like about this indie game:- The sound effects are pretty creepy, and the music is lovely and sinister.- I love the mechanics used, there is a lot to be thinking about as you go.- I think some of the rooms are randomly generated each time you play a new save? (don't quote me on that though) Which if they are is a nice touch, and makes the game a little more challenging. Like how in slender the pages aren't always spawned in the same places every time, but there are a finite amount of locations to find them. - The voice acting isn't bad. The actual reading is good but there have been times I've not been sure about the dialogue. Could just be personal taste though. There is a part where your character makes a joke... and I was kind of like... is this really the time? Focus! Like I say though, could just be me. Overall some of the voice acting is actually very good and this minor detail isn't at all enough to put me off.- The art style is pretty cool. Very immersive but just unreal enough to freak you out. It reminds me of the game ""Deep Sleep"" if you wanted to make it 3D rather than 2D. Some of the images in it are very similar and that game sh*t me up when it was just pixels, so this more life-like game is a lovely bag of nope.- I will note though that the sensitivity of the mouse felt super high and it was very much a case of flailing around, something you'd have to get used to? Occasionally ended up bumping into walls instead of going through doors. :/Would totally recommend it though. Loving it. Can't wait to finish it and get the whole story which on the whole is shaping up rather nicely!I recorded myself playing the first part for my gaming channel if anyone wants to see the game being played a little and see what they are in for:

												I'll give you the rundown of the Pro's and Con's of this game and if you should buy it or not.Pro's:This game has a decent atmosphere and an okay sound track. The creature chasing you is pretty creepy and the way you know he's close is a pretty good idea, you're flashlight starts flickering a little and so you know you need to get the hell out of there. Finding pages isn't that hard since you'll start hearing loud whispering when you come near one, it makes it a lot easier since it would just blend in witheverything else in the game. Graphics are nothing special but not ugly by any means.Con's:Now the level you go through is pretty bland and everything pretty much looks the same without any sense of progression. It's also very linear exept for the occasional choice in differing paths. The creature that's after you is creepy, but not scary. The game will eventually turn into ""run away from monster and quickly pick up notes"". He will not really scare you for about 98% of the game. The items you pick up are also pretty stupid like the axe you just leave behind after using it once. also at some parts you have to use particular items to continue, this will either cause you to back track a bit, or die to the creature chasing you.Over all, I would only say buy this on a steam sale when it's under $0.30 since you really won't be losing that much money if you happen not to like the game.This game gets a 6/10.

You had to keep reloading and reloading, the save until the enemy missed you, and then you ran off and escaped. Sometimes it could take 5 or 10 reloads, before you finally got the lucky miss.

												My X-Box 360 controls are inverted.  Look up actually looks down.  Move forward actually moves backward.I looked at the discussion board to see if there was a fix or workaround, but all I saw were reports of others experiencing the same issue, plus lots of other reported bugs.I'll check back and re-review after the next update (if one is released.)

												1. The enemy is none threatening or scary (half because the heart beat gives it away that it is near). Best comparison is like you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off your grandparent and they are now chasing you on their little scooter that is on 1%.2. I have heard better voice acting from a silent film.3. AMAZING intro but that's it, basically its like eating a jelly doughnut when your first bite was the only part with jelly.4.The atmosphere isn't there.5. The only ""scare"" is a badly designed shadow figure is in front of you and a bad audio of a scream plays.7. This game is a consistent as this was.8.All9.The10.Rooms11.Look12.The13.SAME "

												NO WORDS FOR THIS GAME. Is just amazing. In this game i like idiot ghosts because they got stuck behind the wall when they try to haunt you to death but thats kinda awkward because i spend 1 minute looking at the ghost staying behind the wall and trying to reach his/her point (THATS ME :D).Ok something is really anoying with that music, i mean, really why the hell you put that anoying music in background it doesnt have any sense, you could add something like a broken lamp, an opened window or just an air vent but no that music is anoying and creepy and it makes me look behind in my room every GOD DAMN minute.NEED UPDATES LOOTS OF BUGS AND GLITCHIES FOUND!

												This game is a test whether you have or do not have in-game luck. The Hatman can spawn whenever and wherever he wants, so you cannot be safe anywhere and game can end at any time.When I played for the first time, I was legitimately scared as atmosphere and sound effects did their job perfectly. However, if you want to get all the achievements prepare to be extremely annoyed, bored and not scared as playing this game for hours will make you horror-proof :^)P.S. For those who cannot complete “A good book” achievement. I completed it after replaying the game for 4 times. The successful attempt was by playing as the mother and listening to the pages right after picking them up. "

												""Scariest Game of 2014.""Alien Isolation.  Five Nights at Freddy's.  PT.  Evil Within.  Neverending Nightmares.  Among the Sleep.  Outlast: Whistle Blower.  All far better than this as there is at least one thing scary about them.  And before you argue about budget and indie studios, some developers make games which can do more with less, like NeM.  This game can't do a thing with assets so generic the subtitles and save screens are in default Arial font.You wander the same halls, looking at the same four bits of furniture, ignoring the one blood splatter that appears everywhere, picking up the same journal pages, solving the same puzzle over and over by just wandering around until something shiny appears on the floor (e.g. use hammer on lock, use axe on board that's barely attached to a wall holding a door shut).  All the while the Hat Man, looking like a cheap Halloween decoration, floats around at the speed of smell and poses little to no threat or takes on the form of an incredibly-bored sounding little girl ghost.I haven't been this bored by a ""spooky"" game in quite some time.  Your time and money are better spent elsewhere.			"

												The game has random elements and this is a little bad. You basically wander around hoping to find the next page or item, since you have no control when it appears. The Hat Man isn't really a threat, unless there is a dead end, then you're screw (happens a lot). I died so many times to this ""bad luck"" that I give up (one time I got stuck with Hat Man behind me four times in a row).			"

												I didn't think a game could be creepy. I mean, it's just a game.A game can be creepy.Around 10 minutes of playing though, and I'm thoroughly bored. All there seems to be that I can do is wander around a bit. I'm sure there is some sort of plot there. The adverts and write-up suggested some sort of plot. I just haven't found it yet.I got the game on sale for 19p, down from 79p. For that little, there isn't much to complain about. It looks nice and it has an excellent horror feel to it.

If you don't get scared easly then don't buy this game it is mostly just jump scares but there is a story in the game that is creepy as well. The reason I recommend this game to people like me is because I have anxiety and games like outlaast etc. give me nightmares alot of them etc. so this is one of the few scary games I can enjoy without having sleep issues etc.			"

												At first the game lures you in with a scary atmosphere, and gives you a simple goal to find some pages, and a random ghost for some reason. And for a while, the only thing to scare you is your imagination as you go through a literal endless 1st level that's extremely hard to find anything in, but after a while you learn that this game isn't going to abuse you, it's going to take things slow, maybe a little too slow for a horror game, but then on the second level, it starts getting a little scarier with better ambience, Hatman gets faster and goes through walls for some great jumpscares, as well as an even creepier atmosphere and a little more progress through the story, though not much. Even so, it's a pretty well made game and I'm so excited that the official release finally came. However, there are still some issues that I don't quite like.. Not too big but issues: TOO BIG! Holy crap finding your way through this place and collecting items is harder than a dark souls boss, and progression through 1 level can take maybe an hour if you're not familiar with the game, and seeing the same thing over and over again isn't fun. The second issue is that Hatman only gets harder through levels and not time.I should know, because I'm one of the people who spent an hour on the first level. As you're looking through the first floor frantically looking for missing pages, or an item you may have missed, you get lost easily and well.. It stops being fun. Mostly because Hatman is like a companion you can kill but respawns.. Kind of like Tails in the sonic franchise, he never dies and he will come back later but.. You can kill him again easily. The problem with this is like a battle in skyrim against a townie who can't die, you can hit him over and over and over and over again but he won't go down for good, and the battle is infinite because you can't die to him either. The only option is to step outside and face the guards waiting for you,,,, though in this game that's more like the only option is to keep searching for items..But other than ALL of that, great game!

												This supposedly horror game only it is because of the sounds, and it kind of forces you to use them because they're needed to find the 21 pages. The hat man itself has poor AI, just wandering around and sometimes spawning near you. The game is short, but i liked the procedurally generated asylum. If you buy it cheap, it can give you a couple hours of generic horror gameplay.But there's one thing you should know: this game has broken achievements, and the devs don't seem to care about them. Yes, i hacked them, but if you're a genuine achievement hunter, just stay away, or play it on a separate account.			"

												Brief review:This game is bad.More indepth review:This game is bad. You really don't need to hear anything else. I got it for $0.49 and I feel like I wasted my money. The only reason I got this game is because someone said that you got cards that you could sell at the market place to make some money. I figured I could make my money back at no loss. If there are cards I can't push myself to play it any longer to get them.The atmosphere is somewhat good for the brief 2 or 3 minutes of exploring until you go to the dark world or whatever. The voice acting is pretty bad. There isn't any emotion in the father's voice at all. This game doesn't really say, I'm scared for my daughter and I need to find her. As I was playing the father was cracking jokes while walking around. It made it so cheesey that I had to stop playing. Someone compared it to a slender man game and that's exactly what it is like but I actually got a little scared while playing slender man 8 pages (which is free). I played, got bored, would have prefered to take a nap instead. I hope this review helps someone curious about this game and I can save you 49 cents.			"

												The game mechanics is amazing as the hallways and location change constanly after every turn. This feels original and is compared to the experience of the movie known as ""Grave Encounters I-II"". I highly recommend this game for those who like cheap scares. Pros: +.49 USD when on sale+Scary+Steam Cards+Atmospheric+Creepy little girlCons-Bugs-Low amount of ghosts8/10 on my book "

												This game is literally a chore to play. Terrible. Would not recommend to my cat. Really REALLY sucked. Never EVER EVER want to play it again. Hat man sucked. Rooms sucked. Graphics lame. Random generation sucked. Boring, Finding pages? Really? Slenderman rip off. Hatman was slow and not scary. Babadook rip off.  Closing STatement: Would give negative stars if I could. I will not recommend this game, andf if possible I want a refund. I will consider suing you over this piece of garbage. 49 cents is 49 cents too much.			"

												The climate isn't bad, but the game is still boring and repetetive. This is possible to be scared, because of the audio, which isn't bad. The graphics is old, but it doesn't matter. To be honest, I thought this game is worse.5/10			"

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward Review - Raymond KTThe props are so repetitive; there's one chair model, one table model, a few blood splatters, one bed model, a fan, a ceiling light, a lamp, and a few other objects that are just copy and pasted all over the game. And the asylum mine as well be the middle of a dark forest, because every hall looks the same, and repeated objects like iron lung machines and wheelchairs are copy and pasted throughout those as well. There's no sense of direction and an asylum with architecture like this would only make it's inhabitants even more crazy, as it almost drove me insane because I thought I was going in circles when I was actually progressing. And clicking on doors only opens them about 20% of the time, you'll have to click about 10 times to open a bathroom stall door, but let me save you some time right now: there's nothing in any of them. Because this game is too repetitive and ""copy-pasted"" to have any unique discoveries. Hitting SPACE to jump also only works a percentage of the time; the controls are literally broken.			"

												I saw Markiplier play this game and I thought I would buy it to experience it for myself and I have to say this game ticks the main boxes (scare factors, atmosphere), but I think the voice acting in the book reading ruins the immersion. At least one of the pages (probably more, but I only know of the one page) that I was looking at did not match what was being read out and the quality of the voice acting was disappointing. Also, regardless of whether you play as the mother or father, when you die the scream still sounds like a woman's. Other than that, for the asking price, it is worth it for the scares; I even had nightmares twice after playing the game, so if you are looking for scares, buy this game. I would recommend that you turn the book reading voice off though.ProsScary atmosphereScary ambienceShadow People and the Hat Man himself deliver the scaresGood graphicsConsBad quality voice actingVoice does not match one (or more) of the pages being shown in the bookScream is the same regardless of whether playing as mother or fatherOverall: 92.5% recommendation			"

												While this game has some okay horror/scare elements, the controls and overall gameplay is quite boring and the graphics are very basic.  There is also a fair amount of minor glitches, for instance getting stuck in a wall and having to close the game and restart.  As well as the fact there really is very little guidance as to what you have to do next.I can tell by many of the reviews that a lot of people liked this game, but I just thought it was yet another mediocre horror game that was best left on a site like Gamejolt as a F2P.  With that said, its a cheap game.  So who knows, maybe you'll like it...and if you don't, well, it's not like you broke the bank buying it.			"
