												Split/Second is, hands down, my favorite racing game ever and one of my all-time best games.  I bought this game for both the PC and the PS3 even before it came to Steam and I played the hell out of both versions.  This is a great game that any racing fan should play at least once and is also a great entry game for those wishing to check out the genre.The premise of this game is, frankly, not very original but sets up the game nicely.  You are a contestant on the new explosive racing show Split/Second.  During the course of the ""season"" you will have to compete in races to advance to the next ""episode.""  Finishing higher in events will get you more points and will allow you to progress further in the season.  Each episode is capped off by an Elite Race, a race around the track against Split/Second's best drivers.  Beat each episode to win the season championship.  Like I said, not very original but it gets the job done.The gameplay is very simple.  You race around a track, drift around the corners and use power-ups to destroy your opponants.  However, the center piece of this game is that it doesn't use traditional power-ups like those in Mario Kart or Blur.  Instead, you attain energy through drifts, drafts, and air-time.  Once you have enough, you can activate power-plays on the track, which usually involve destroying parts of the track to crush your rivals.  Filling up your energy all the way will allow you activate the biggest power plays on the track and will also allow you to change the track's route (if the track has a route changer).  Racing hard while effectively using your power plays are essential if you want to win the season championship.In addition to the races, there are also several other types of events.  The first one is Elimination.  It's similar to the race, but there aren't any set laps.  Instead, a there is a timer that counts down.  When the timer reaches zero, the last place car is eliminated from the race.  Survive all eliminations to win.  The second event is the Air Strike, where a helicopter shoots missles at you and you have to dodge the missle waves in order to gain points.  The longer you last, the harder the waves become to dodge.  Gain the most points to win the event.A variant of the Air Strike event is the Air Revenge, which is kind of like a boss fight.  Instead of getting points for dodging missles, you get power-play energy in addition to the energy you get from drifts and jumps.  You can then use the energy to reflect the missiles back at the helicopter.  Down the helicopter in the shortest amount of time to win.The final event is by far my favorite: Survival.  Here, semis are driving around a track while dropping bombs in front of you in order to kill you.  As you stay alive and pass these trucks, you gain points.  Passing several trucks in a row without dying will increase your score multiplyer.  Get the highest score to win the event.  I have sunk hours on end trying to beat my own high scores, so I think you'll get alot out of this mode.On the down side, this game's graphics are pretty standard.  It looks okay, but if you're more accustomed to the realistic racing games like Forza then you'll definately notice the difference.  There are also some glitches and hitbox issues that, while not game-breaking, can lead to outburts of rage over what the heck just happened.  Sometimes, though, the glitches can be entertaining in their own right (like getting killed by an explosion and restarting a hundred feet in the air).  These issues, however, are very infrequent and most likely won't dampen you experience.  [EDIT] As for the controls, there isn't a manual shifting option, which I don't mind but some might be a bit miffed that this wasn't included.  Also, the initial key set-up is a bit weird.  You drive using the arrow keys and use the right control and right shift buttons to activate power plays.  I assume this was done so that a second player could use the WASD area of the keyboard when doing split-screen.  Thankfully, this is easily remediated since all inputs can be remapped in the Options menu, but it's still a bit jarring when you first start.So those are the basics of Split/Second.  It is very simplistic but very addictive.  There's also a bit more to the game than what I mentioned, but I'll leave you to discover those on your own if you wish to pursue this game.  Score: 8/10			"

												I'm going to reccomend this game, but with a huge warning,The PC port SUCKS:The multiplayer doesn't work,Gamepad support is there but the on screen prompts still display keyboard,It censored my online name(Flyingscorpions is offensive but Flyingscorpion isn't?)Framerate capped to 30No real graphic update from console editionsStill if you can look past all that, it's still a solid game, gives a nice feeling of adrenaline and enough explosions to make Michael Bay go for the lube.AI's pretty stupid though, so the lack of multiplayer is a big issue			"

												First things first:- Steam Trading Cards is available now.- You may notice the DRM warning about SecuROM. Yes, this game HAS SecuROM, but it doesn't USE SecuROM. Confusing, eh ? From what I gathered, SecuROM was wrapped inside the .exe file and the activation process was automated. There's no limited activation, you can launch the game from Steam and there's no pop-up about SecuROM, so basically, this♥♥♥♥♥♥can be ignored completely. TL;DR: SecuROM is inactive in this game so you don't have to worry about it.- Multiplayer is dead, master server was shut down several years ago. However, you can still using Hamachi to play with friends or even play split-screen co-op.- FPS is capped at 30. I personally don't mind this at all.- Very limited graphics customization. You can change resolution, v-sync and overall quality. However, the game's well optimized and there's no stuttering or freezing during gameplay.- Mouse is not usable, just like F1 games.That was all technical stuffs you need to know. About the game, Split/Second is still a freaking great game as it was 4 years ago.+ Great graphics, car models look awesome, try switch route and you'll drop your jaw when a freakin' carrier starts collapsing. Cars look bad when they're destroyed though, it feels like their body parts just start detaching rather than being heavily damaged.+ Racing + Michael Bay explosion. The formula of a ♥♥♥♥ing intense tv series.+ Great soundtrack.+ A great variety of game modes. We have classic races, elite races a.k.a mini tournament, airstrike (dodge missiles from helicopter), air revenge (kinda like airstrike but you can deflect missles and troll helicopters), elimination (last car standing)... + Simple enough to play, but really tough to master.- I don't know why the hell they put a limitation on name characters (I tried Masterchiefs but the game showed ************).- Only two camera angles.- Infrequent hitbox glitches.- Weird control, but you can rebind keys later after the tutorial.With the multiplayer is offically unplayable, I don't think the game's worth $20, but a 50% discount or more would be strongly recommend. Split/Second is fun, enjoyable and unique (well, not that unique but Blur was removed from Steam so I guess there's no other choices right now). If you want an action racing game that's simple but also addictive, then look no further, Split/Second is ready to blow up your monitor.			"

												If you don't want to read this boring a** review, then I'll say this, it's okay for a PC version, but I would rather have the console version to have a better experince. But the game itself is great if you enjoy a pure arcade expeince. So for the main portion of this game I'll give it a recommend.After playing this game four years since its release, I've really got my money's worth because of the excitement that this game provides. But first let me say that this will be mostly based on my review on the console (which I played the game mostly on).Okay so how should I say about this game: Micheal Bay explsions (the good kind!), crazy crashes, on edge races, and drifting everywhere! This game provdies a great orginal arcade experince to the racing genre by using the enviroment as your weapon. Exploding taxi cars to a falling cargo plane, this game provides an on edge experince that puts you on your toes, watching for the enviroment that may crush your chance at winning. There's a great varity of obstacles that you can use to crash your oppenents to gain that first spot position. Even though after a while that you'll immediately remember what objects that will be used by your opponents, the fun factor is about stragatizing your moves, or powerplays. Powerplays are basicly your main mechanic of triggering the enviroment around you to stop your opponents from pulling away. With the blue bars representing the small powerplays that are mostly scattered around the tracks. And you have your red bars which triggers the more drastic or ""epic"" powerplays which will most likely wreck your opponents. These powerplays are fairly balanced which you can aviod by memorizing their actions when being acitvated. The objects that you can use your powerplay on has a nice unique features based on what enviroment is being raced on.The tracks in this game are decent to say the best. Some have a good balance of alternative routes, but there are some routes that can completely waste a considerable amount of time, expically with shortcuts. But at the same time with shortcuts (which are used by powerplays), the game is trying to teach you again to stratagize your powerplays bars so that you can be prepared whenever you come across one.Back to the track design, the tracks in the game can be both fun and fustrating, based on your vehicle of choice and playstyle. Tracks like Downtown or Power Plant can be a bit fun and annoying at the same time because of the tight corners, but can be mastered with throttle control and again the vehicle of choice. Whereas tracks like Dry Docks will rely more of vehicles with higher speed and a bit less corner efficiancy.The vehicles in the game are decent to say the less in terms of being competitive. I feel that the majority of the cars in the game aren't that useful to drive because of their drifting capabilities. There are some that drifts out really wide and doesn't grip that well with the road and there are those that can grip around corners like it's on rails. But that doesn't goes to say that those that grip that well while drifting are bad. The Goliath and the Titan, which are trucks, are mostly useful for tracks that isn't technical and rely more on straights.The handling in this game is a bit weird. You can't simply do a smooth turn in a long hander turn of a chicane because of the dramatic loss of speed as compared to the tapping on the analog stick. So wheel users, I wouldn't even bother.... But the pro about the handling is that each car has its own handling characteristic, so every exeprince with a different car would be different than the other, which is great for a arcade game.Comparing the AI's to the PC port and the console port, it's better in a sense that the AI's are compeitive, but at the same time, the rubberbanding is a bit ridiculous in the PC port which makes it fustrating to get 1st in all races.How do I think of the PC port as compared to the console overall? Honeslty, it sucks. There's a couple of things that may turn PC players away from this game: One is the frames are capped to 30fps, which to some is immersive breaking, but personally for me I don't really mind that much. Second is the icons for the Xbox controller isn't there......at all. I'm literally shocked to see that Blackrock (which went defunt) or Disney Interactive didn't even add controller support for the PC port. The graphic options isn't there either, just the basic quality options. So if you want to turn off AA or lower the shadows, that AIN'T happenin'. Some of the sounds in this game are muffled, which is weird. From what I've heard, the multiplayer is dead, unless you use a third party software or program. And oh yeah, there's no DLC for this port either, which made me a bit disappointed. Overally, I'm a bit neutral about this port, the basic's in this game isn't that different with the console port, which I'm glad, but I wish that they gave the PC version more support to make it equally enjoyable.

												If you haven't played this, consider your life a huge waste of time.This is my absolute favorite of my three most-loved combat racing games (BLUR and Burnout Revenge being the other two).  Every bit as good as the console version for XBox 360 or the cloud-based OnLive service - and with a controller, it plays the same.  Highly recommended for a great, highly-entertaining racer.  It's a lot of fun and will uninstall/reinstall to your account without issue.  Sure, I have some gripes about frame-rate and resolution options, but it's easy to overlook those.  Don't let yourself miss out on the experience of one of the greatest racing games ever made.  Maybe someday another company will hijack this basic concept and run with it, taking advantage of new-gen graphics and processing.Note:  There is a save-game glitch that occurs at or after the Midway Pass episode.  Don't quit the game when this appears or else you'll risk your save file corrupting and losing all of your progress.  You can get around the glitch by playing through the next two or three races (the number of races you'll need to play through seems to depend upon where the autosave glitch happens).  This glitch will resolove itself and, once it does, you can continue playing as normal or exit the game without worrying about the autosave file corrupting itself and erasing your prior race history.  Whatever you do:  don't exit the game before the glitch has a chance to resolve itself.			"

												Split/Second is a year 2010 arcade racing game, which goes faster than NFS right from the start, and giving much more king-sized demolition than the Flatout. With that said, it is a mediocre game, which can be fun, but not for long. There are enough of breathtaking sequences, but they satisfy much better from the backseat, on youtube, rather than playing that yourself.No doubt, it is an engrossing moment, when in the middle of race a transatlantic Boing crushing right on your head. And it is even better when you dodge this flight in the last second. Too bad, but for the most time of gameplay, you'll be the one under the blast and not one around it.Of course, like almost always, there are non-optimal controls. But, what is more, there are too little field for player to tweak the race for own benefit, but to choose a car to drive. Those cars provides a little of variety in proportions between speed, acceleration, and so on, but, in the most cases, you'll be driving two, maybe four cars through the whole game. All other variants are just ""for show"", for ""big numbers"", and not for real variety and usability. You can't really tune cars for your style of driving or for certain circumstances, that is the first real downside.Second big mishap is AI, which will always be one step ahead of you, even after you managed to blow all and everything around you in little pieces. Just the few seconds later, it will be you who'll be ripped apart, without any chance to dodge.Yeah, about demolitions, dodging and racing in general. The main feeling from racing is the same as with NFS games - you can push from borders without loosing speed, you almost not need to slow down in corners, and yet catching the track just fine. But when it comes to dodging the explosions... It turns out that their physical modelling is very far from natural. For a thousand times you'll be thinking you are ways away from blast, but will be in flames an instant later.And the fourth nail is the bad optimisation. I have a dvd with that game which works much better than ""always updated"" steam version. There are a major problem with missable/breakable save games, which made so many people raged there on steam. Blast the DRM!With all that said about downsides of the game, I'm still vouching that you may try it. Especially if you buy it with some major discount about 80% of price... I'd say that Blur, the classmate of Split/Second, is much better, and should be picked first, for much more enjoyment... But Steam not selling Blur anymore. So if you are into arcade racing, but get tired of NFS and Flatout series both, get Split/Second! It'll give you some fresh air, if only for two or three nights... It's still better than nothing, right? And what a marvelous explosions you'll taste there!Overall mark - 6.95/10 - best when under 5$ price, even better in some bundle.			"

												An underrated gem from 2010. Very reminiscent of the Burnout series, and also where Watch_Dogs got its hacking mechanics from. The TV-show setting is a nice excuse to make the game very cinematic and make you use the environment at your advantage.PROS+ Fast-paced arcade gameplay with spectacular explosions and varied content+ Power Plays let you exploit the environment to stop your opponents and create new routes+ Superb graphics (for its time), great soundtrack and cinematic sound effects+ Splitscreen and LAN multiplayerCONS- Online multiplayer is closed down. Only way to play with other people is by using software like Tunngle, Evolve, etc.- 30 FPS cap- Basic car damage model			"

												Split/Second gives me 6 keys: gas, brakes, left, right, blow stuff up, blow big stuff up. That amply describes the gameplay, and I have to say the game looks gorgeous at that (playing with max settings, but on 720p because my gfx card is old), I haven't had that much fun with a  racing game for a long time, and I'm only two races in at this point.Forget about guided missiles and mines and oil slicks, that's all small stuff that lesser games deal in; here we're allowed to remotely trigger explosions. You drift, you fill your bar, you blow objects up as your opponents pass them, and if you collect enough drift points, you can do some big ones like explosively redesign the race course. (Yes, that is as awesome as  it sounds.)If you ever wanted to star in an action movie, forget all those guns and shooting, Split/Second is where it's at. Who wouldn't want to play this? (Tip: switch your camera to hood view to be even closer to the action.)Split/Second has LAN, online, and Split Screen play.			"

												One of the best arcade racing games I had to play and definitely my favorite. Have been playing the game since it's release in 2010.  It's like an easy, outgoing friend of yours with whom you can always have fun. The game is stunning visually, breathtaking action wise and really easy to play. Considering this is a game of 2010 and it feels like something of this year, gives it a lot of credit. You race through different destructible tracks, blowing up your opponenents via triggered explosions and changing the track altogether. There is almost no HUD to inhibit your perception of shower of visual effects thrown at you. There are many different cars for different tastes and playstyles, each handles and acts differently on the track. Great dynamic soundtrack changing to the pace of action. The only downside for me is that it does not have official multiplayer support. This game deserves to be on Steam servers. As an alternative you can use Hamachi if you have a group of friends or tune in to Tunngle server room of Split/Second to play with random people (unfortunately cheaters are present there).Anyways, it's an amazing, breathtaking and fun experience even for solo-play. Just turn up the volume and enjoy the crazy ride!8.5/10			"

												*Foreword: While this game just recently made its way here, I have been playing for years now, for a couple hundreds of hours at least, so my ""hrs on record"" is a little off.This is an arcade racing game where you have to drift/draft/jump in order to get your bar filled up so you can trigger power plays. Power plays basically trigger explosions in front of you to take out your opponents. (The explosions will harm you as well if you time them poorly.) As this is a racing game, the aim is almost always to cross the finish line first.Power plays have two levels. Level 1 power plays range from simple explosions (like dropping explosive barrels on your opponents) to blowing up gas stations, planes, etc. With level 2 power plays you can blow up a bridge/dam/ship/road, or make an airplane crash land on the track and so forth. Some Level 2 power plays are also route changers which destroy part of the track thus opening up a whole new (usually faster) section while blocking the old one.The more I played, the more I realized that this game is all about timing. It really makes a difference when you trigger the various explosions or when you make that explosive barrel drop. There are also simple power plays, where you open up a door temporarily to take a shortcut. The ones behind you can get a free ride through as long as they are close enough, but once the door closes, the rest of them attempting to get through will crash.The various cars feel very different. Some of them start to drift easier, some are harder to blow up, some fills up the bar faster, etc. There are a couple of game modes too, but not all of them are playable in multiplayer.My biggest ""problem"" with this game is that there are only 11 tracks. But it has a Split/Screen mode which is a rare treat nowadays. I already had countless hours of fun playing with my friends side by side. Not that I would get tired of it any time soon, but honestly, a track editor would make this game ageless.All in all, it is insanely fun trying to avoid crashing when something just blew up near you sending your car drifting sideways while looking for the perfect moment to trigger a power play in order to beat your opponents to the finish line.

The game runs with a 30fps lock but runs fine who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥whether it has a frame cap just enjoy a damn good racing game. Try to get it on sale especially if you can get in the pack with Pure.

												I loved this game when it came out in 2010, but I ran it on much weaker hardware so I hardly noticed 30 FPS cap. Now, on 2015 hardware it is quite a different story. Usually I don't mind playing with lower FPS, but in Split/Second the FPS lock is almost unbearable. The action is not fluid, it's jerky and playing for more than 5 minutes is making me very dizzy.The game itself is great (the concept, the explosions...), but this technical aspect has ruined it for me. If only I hadn't idled it for card I would have asked for my first refund on Steam. If you are considering buying this game be cautious, test it first and if you cannot bear the 30 FPS lock - refund it!EDIT: Decreasing resolution from 1080p to 720p helped a bit with my feeling of dizziness while playing, but the game is still noticeably jerky.

												Just as fun and beautiful as the first time I played it, years ago. Sucks that the servers are down, but♥♥♥♥♥♥happens. The rest of the game is still completely worth the money. It shouldn't be too difficult for anyone who's looking for a good smash em up racing game. It's explosive, fast paced, and a unique turn from your typical broom broom simulator. The controls for keyboard/mouse are honestly pretty nice, though I still prefer a controller (Which may be an issue for some, I know it was for me. I used to pinnacle to get mine working smoothly). The game itself is fairly large and should keep you entertained for as long as most games do, maybe longer. Graphics wise, looks beautiful even by today's standards. And apparently there's a 30 fps cap? To me, it honestly feels like it's not there, if it truly is to begin with. Awesome game, completely worth your money. Only downside is the lack of official servers.			"

												If there were a racing game made by a big Hollywood studio then it would be Split Second. Essentially it's a karting game, but instead of having weapons on your vehicle the track has been set up with hazards such as bombs and falling buildings. There are lots of different game modes to keep it interesting such as the usual races, time trials and it's own ""don't get shot by the helicopter"" mode.Unfortunately the game does only run at 30FPS which isn't very ""PC"", but it's hardly life threatening.

												One of the best racing games of the last generation and a true all-time classic, Split/Second is a rare arcade racer which does absolutely nothing to allow you obtuse customization, isn't open world, and doesn't have some half-baked narrative experience.It's all about the racing.It's fast, furious, and completely over-the-top, with huge explosions, a really compelling mechanic around destroying and altering the track, and, most importantly, an unparalleled sense of speed. There are few other racing games which give you the sense that you're barely in control of the monster machine you're driving — Motorstorm: Apocalypse being one of the only other ones that comes to mind.I cannot recommmend this game enough to fans of pure racing. This is one of the best.			"

												If you've ever loved one of those old Don Simpson / Jerry Bruckheimer action flicks like Top Gun or The Rock, then I guarantee that you will extract an immense sense of satisfaction and joy from playing Split/Second. Yes it's a straight xbox 360 port which as-such is locked to 30fps for technical reasons which apparently cannot be undone, but don't let that detract from what is a highly unique and explosive driving experience.

												Do not expect any further updates/multiplayer fixes/reworks etc, the game developer is defunt.This game is effectively ""dead"" except for the admittedly fun single player/local multiplayer.That said onto the review:I used to own this on the ps3 when it came out and...I forgot how much the AI ♥♥♥♥ing cheats in this game.There is no rear vision mirror, this is because the game developer doesnt want you to see the cars teleporting in behind you.There is no Speedometer, this is because the game developer doesnt want you to know the speed stats are a lie.The car stats you see and what the AI has are two completely different things.If you plan to win the only important stats are accelleration & toughness, having a higher top speed just means the AI's topspeed on all cars is better than yours, drafting stat isnt really that important provided its above 3~ so you can turn your car goodly.Infact the BETTER cars in the game are the ones with high acelleration and comparatively LOW top speed, you unlock one early with 1 speed and 5 accel, this car has the best chance of winning at all levels (in race or elimination vs AI not humans) with heavy use of ingame traps as the AI slows itself down so you dont fall too far behind.Your high accelleration means you can stay on the AI and draft to build power alot more easily, and your low speed means you'll actually see the racer in first place instead of him been 8+ seconds ahead the entire race even though you you never crashed your car or ♥♥♥♥ed up.Simply, if you dont want to play against SUVs that are invulnerable to explosions and outpace your lamborghini-esque car, do not use a lamborghini-esque car, use a shitbox with good accelleration.The AI also will not EVER attempt to use explosions/traps on other AI they only target you making getting into 2nd-1st extermely difficult as they've had a free run for the first half/entire lap because no matter what car you use (even on revisited early races with endgame cars) the AI is ALWAYS faster than you off the mark by 2-3seconds and then goes uncontested/unblocked for a decent amount of time.The power play mechanic is badly implemented and makes been in first place actually detrimental to your chances of winning the race as the only ways to consistantly gain speed is to1. Turn poorly and draft which allows the speedhacking AI to easily overtake you as you're turning wide/slowing down.2. Not be in first place and follow someone for 10+ seconds3. Almost get him by AI traps (only way to gain power while in first place)To actually win in this game you need to tail the AI in first place and kill him right at the end using traps or expect to randomly get overtaken right before you win by an SUV that according to ingame stats is worse in every single stat comparatively to your god car.Oh, and the AI will NEVER attempt to blow each other up at all, ever. Its basically a 1v7 race where the goal of 6 of the cars is to delay you so the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in firstplace can get an impossible lead or remove all your power so you cant kill said ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.In summary its a very fun CASUAL ""blow all the cars up simulator"" i honestly cannot call this a racing game, because for it to be a racing game you would place depending on player skill, and in the single player campaign that is not how the game works.The detonation/survival/airstrike etc gamemodes are probably the most fun/repeatable features you can play in singleplayer/competitively with a friend because there isnt any AI to cheat and its argueably ""skill"" based. That is until you run into impossible airstrike patterns because the helicopter decided that the small 2lane section of racetrack right after a corner where you are is a perfect spot to drop 8+ missiles.

												Alrite. I already play this since 2010, and to be honest, this game was the best racing game ever for me. If you still haven't play this game, do try. However, if you don't like a non-customization car, lack of tracks, and being bullied by AI, this game is not for you.This game is full with explosive action. You are one of TV show contestant. This game got 12 episode, and each episodes contains different mode (elimination, race, etc), and each episodes contain 5 mode, incuding two locked modes. 1 mode is locked by default until you meet the requirement to unlock it, while the last one is Elite race. By winning top 3 of Elite race, next episode will be unlocked. This game only contains 9 tracks/map, with exception extra 2 map for Survival modes. Car are great, with 3 locked cars, which you must complete requirement instead credit to unlock them. One of them is Disney-theme car, which you can unlock it by putting cheats, and it will be available until you exit the game. Also, this game is no longer support online multiplayer mode. Do Googles if you wish to try Online mode.Pros:- Pack with explosive- Instant Replay to see your destructive Big Power Play/Change Routes (only available if you mange to wreck 1 or more opponent).- Various modes and few of them are quite challenging- Creative power play design- Unique cars, which most of them are modified from original model (like Ford Mustang Boss).- Amazing Soundtrack.- SPLIT SECOND ELITE RACE!!- Vertical SPlit Screen for 2 player.Cons:- AI only active powerplay to bully you.- Lack of security. Cracked game can register/join Online mode. Also no restriction about trainer, which is sucks and horrible for online experience.			"

First Impressions:Fun explosive racing, not too many like this on PC.Instead of the vehicles having weapons you use the hazardous environment against your opponents.Recommended if you like that 'Burnout' (on consoles) style of gameplay.I bought this as part of the Disney Extreme Racing Pack. Also included is an extreme offroad ATV (Quad-bike) trick-racing game called PURE. That is a very fun racing game but is no longer for sale on the Steam Store. I'd recommend that as well if the subject matter interests you. Although that game is plagued by long loading times and from what I have read doesn't work on WIndows 10.			"

												This is a game I have played on console before I got it on PC. The game has a very fun way of improving the format of a racing title. Be warned there are no real cars in this game, you are not blowing up new Bugattis. Also it is frame locked at 30 and even after I went into the settings and changed everything, it still looked better on my old console than my up to date PC. It was made for that generation and you will probably enjoy it much better on there. If you dont have a console gen that can run this game, it is still worth the buy. The unique way of racing in the game is a fun twist on the basics. I did, however, get it on sale.			"

												Ok this game is one of my all time favorites I will be honest the first time I played this game it was a pirated copy. I liked it so much that I unintalled it and I wanted to buy the retail version, but after some searching I could not find it and forgot about it for years then when I saw steam had it I bought it right away. I know I only have a hour and a half in the game but I played the hell out of it when I had the pirate copy got all the way to the 10th episode(yes the game is broken down into episodes with 5 races in each). The car handling is ok I wasn't expecting much out of it but It was fun, really fun, really really fun. The one thing I will say though is if you don't like a challenge then this is not the game for you. The computer will catch up really quickly when you are in first. I like that though it makes the races a little more challenging and I feel good when I win a race by 0.4 seconds(hence the name Split/Second). I really wish someone would make a sequel to this game it is fun like I said give it a shot and you might like it as well I whole heartedly recommend this game.			"

Although, the singleplayer was rather easy and short. The multiplayer servers have been shut down a while ago, so you can only play on dedicated servers. But even still, no one is playing multiplayer. So just forget that feature. The Music quality is very good, although the sound effects isn't the greatest.

Drifting helps build the necessary gauge to start an event, more importantly a good drift is rewarded with a slight boost, while a bad one can cost more time than reducing speed on sharp turns, so dont be afraid of going slower when necessary always save enough gauge to start an event when firstThis is a great game but it's not perfect 30 FPS cap Not complex gameplay wise Partial controller support Exaggerated rubber banding Only local MPScore:8/10			"

												I would prefer BLUR over this game but i will recommend it ONLY IF IT IS ON SALE !!This game has a brilliant idea which brings racing and explosives together. But this kind of racing game needs a lot of optimizations to be a fluid and playable game.I loved this idea and the episodic game but after completing the races and episodes, the game became boring. Because the variety comes to an end after the episodes are complete. All you do is trying to perfect the same races with same explosive options. And the gameplay is not that smooth.If you play with real people, it can be a bit more fun because humans know when to trigger events and they do not hold back. But again the clumsy gameplay kills it as you experience weird crashes.And there is a save file problem. This game has a bug that corrupts the savegame and you have to start all over. I have never experienced it thankfully, but people say it happens.If you can buy this on sale and do not expect to play this for months and if you like maniac explosive action while racing, you could give this game a shot. But remember the strange vehicle behavior and repetitive gameplay.and occasional savegame bugs. "

												Split/Second is a unique racing game. It's HEAVILY Arcade, so if you're looking for anything remotely realistic, veer clear. There basically 2 types of cars in this game: those that take a lot of punishment and those that are fast and drift around corners. The game's career mode is split into 12 episodes, presented like TV episodes (just a very quick narration of ""this time on"" followed by some explosions. Speaking of explosions: This is the meat of the game. You will be racing against 7 opponents, blowing them up, while not getting blown up yourself. But this is no combat racer. You don't have any weapons, apart from your ""power play"" bar. You can have 3 different bars and you fill them up by drifting or drafting. Once a bar is full it can be activated at certain moments to either activate a shortcut or one of the many booby traps on a track, which consist of exploding vehicles, giant cranes, rocks, exploding barrels dropped by helicopters and so forth. Some can only be activated once, others as often as you like. This simply requires an opponent ahead of you and you timing correctly when to press the button and hoping to catch them in the detonation or blast wave. You will have to learn the tracks and their respective booby traps to be effective, since each and every one works differently. This is also where heavier vehicles have an advantage, since a blast wave doesn't knock them out as easily.The game also offers various ""landscaping"" options for each track. Once you fill 3 bars of your powerplay, it turns orange and you can cause major destruction, which results in the track being changed. Very effective if an enemy is right in front of you and gets crushed by a ship or whatever. This makes the tracks even more interesting and volatile.Apart from that there are a few different modes like Elimination (last place after x seconds is out), time trial (with explosions), Big Rig (pass trucks that bombard you with exploding barrels) and Heli Attack (evade missiles from a helicopter). Can't remember if there are any more, apart from the Elite Race at the end of each episode that you need to finish in 3rd at least I think to continue on.Each race awards you with points to unlock new vehicles. The better you place, the more points you get (not repeatable, but you can replay every race as often as you want to get 1st place if you so desire). They also unlock the next Elite Race, so technically you either don't have to do all the races or you don't have to finish 1st. Apart from that each episode contains a bonus race if you wreck enough enemies throughout that episode (repeatable in races).It's pretty much the only game that offers this gameplay as far as I know, at least the only one with halfway decent graphics even by today's standards. Also runs perfectly fine under Windows 10, just the sound is weirdly subdued for whatever reason. Can't remember if this had been the case when I played it years ago.			"

												The gameplay is fun enough with arcade style racing and explosions in the mix, but in single player the AI are literally just gunning for you. Any attacks on the race that hit other cars were probably meant for you and it seems like the AI can catch up to you pretty quick once you hit 1st place. This made certain races a bit frustrating. This game doesn't support online play anymore, but I think any local co-op would be more fun because then it wouldn't necessarily be all vs 1. Don't think I'd recommend it as a whole, there are probably better arcade racers out there. But if you like explosions, you have friends to play with, and it's cheap af... maybe then consider it.

												14/20the game is good but i highly suggest to get it on xbox 360 rather than on steam for a simple reason ...the game's got an inner bug that will corrupt your save game files once you reach season 5 ... and 1 player out of 100 only will go throught it, basically making half the content of the game ... unacessible on the PC version. a shame, especially since the devs  could have fixed this since a long time ... or maybe they just don't bother with long time overdue issues.

												This game looks very promising and the gameplay is very interesting and fun. However, I can't recommend this game due to several issues. (Also, don't let my hours played fool you, I played a lot more then that)It says it has full controller support, but this seems hit or miss. Some people can play it fine with controllers, while others can't. I fall in the latter category. I have a Xbox 360 (wired) controller and have no issues in other games at all. However I can't use it in this game at all.The sound has several volume levels. In the cutscenes, the sound is way higher then when you're actually playing (I'm not talking a 1/10 sound level difference, but at least 4-5/10). In the first cutscene there are also helicopters, which are so loud, you can't hear what is being said at all. Same goes when racing. It's almost impossible to hear what's being said and you have to rely on text pop ups to see what you have to do.A lot of people also seem to experience save file corruptions. I have not encountered this myself yet, but there are so many people that suffer from it, that it's just ridiculous.The gameplay itself is really good though. There are a lot of explosions and the story is pretty interesting (not great, but good for a racing game).Overall, it's a good game, but with the issues listed, I can't recommend getting it, especially not for the full price.

												This is one of the best arcade racing simulators ever made, also it's one of the best games ever to be released by Disney. The online multiplayer mode WAS very nice while the servers were online. Now you can play multiplayer only in a LAN or by using a LAN emulator like Tunngle, however it's not the same thing as the original. I would recommend the game even more if Disney decided to give some money for the removavl of SecuROM and the restart of the multiplayer servers. It's not adequate to sell this game without the online multiplayer, because that was the best part of it - to play against people online.THINK ABOUT IT, DISNEY!			"

												This is a terrible port of an otherwise fun game. 1) Full controller support is a lie, I had to try with multiple pc controller settings to get it to work, and on top of that it doesn't work with any pc steering wheels. Guys, FULL support should mean FULL support of all controllers, not just a few.2) For me changing anything graphics wise in the options will crash the game to desktop. I can't increase or even decrease resolution, I can't turn on VSync, and as a result the game looks absolutely terrible. Combine that with 30 fps lock and it's just not worth my time. 3) Sounds glitch out and sometimes disappear completely. Do you know how boring it is to try and play this game when the music, engine and eplosion sound effects are all gone? You're basically playing on mute at that point. 4) Unskippable cutscenes. No more needs to be said. (But seriously, in a racing game?)5) Menus are unfinished since after completing any event you don't have the option to go back to main menu. You have to restart that event, pause the game, then you can go back to the main menu. That's not even acceptable in a mobile game!I could go on about this, but like this game I'd just be wasting time and effort. "

												As a race driver with no concept of self-preservation you tear down a track sabotaged by al-Qaeda. With an unquenchable lust for glory and murder it is your goal to outrace and outlive your adversaries for I presume moolah and 	renown. This gem was pushed out by Disney while they were busy keeping The Lion of Judah from opening the seven seals. It came to be the high point of my twilight years as a supple adolescent boy. And lo, and behold Disney has spread their demonic influence to Steam and once again ensnared me with the promise of nostalgic bliss and explosion porn. And their dark incantation continues to succeed years later in its goal of providing an exhilarating and sometimes nail-biting experience as you murder your competiton by blowing up cars, crashing airplanes, blowing up aircraft carriers, blowing up buildings, blowing up black people and other jihadist methods of entertainment as well as good old fashioned vehicular violence that makes Criterion shed a tear of joy up in heaven. Please Disney, Use your black magic to resurrect BlackRock studio for a  much deserved sequel.			"

												Shame on the developers for advertising this game as a 'racing' game, this piece of trash shares absolutely no similarity between any of the existing good racing games both in terms of mechanics and competitiveness. If you like to have the outcome of your game be based on your skill level, look elsewhere as this game cheats so blatantly that it renders this game absolutely unplayable. Just about every major gameplay aspect of the game is pointless in terms of competitive racing.-Drifting? Pointless. There is no effective way of recovering from a drift and it does nothing to help you as it slows you down to an incredible level.-Unlocking cars? Pointless. For every new car, your opponent AI automatically gets a car that is at least two level above yours, so whatever car you bring into a race makes no difference whatsoever as you will always automatically be in a disadvantage. (Every opponent car, regardless of model, will have a better acceleration and top speed than you do)-Powerplay? Pointless. Each time you wreck an opponent car, they receive a huge acceleration bonus as well as speed bonus, making them able to catch up to you within the matter of seconds. -Taking the lead? Pointless. I have seen cars that literally spawn right in front of me right before the finish line, so you can be in first place and two seconds away from the finish line and still end up in fifth as you see four other cars spawn right next to you and zoom past the finish line. How such a fantastic idea of a video game came up with such a poor level of execution is beyond me.  "

												I like this game, I really do. And here comes the big ""but""......the rubberband mechanics are killing the fun. You dominate an elimination race, for instance, where the last in the round gets taken out after a fiew seconds. You do a flawless race, you hold 1st position for almost the entire race. Until the last seconds, that is. This is when all of a sudden one ore two or three cars are behind and then all of a sudden in front of your car, you have only 10 seconds to gain a better position and there is a drift anchor attached to your bumper.Add to this a limitation of 30 fps and non-support of controllers other than the 360 controller.The game still looks awesome, the action can be amazing, but seriously, the rubberband mechanics are killing the game for me.

												Technically too flawed. I don't even get 10 fps in menus in 1080p with a graphics card that is newer than the game. I have to play the game in 1024x768 and even then it dips down to 20 fps now and then, plus it's capped at 30 fps which sucks for a racing game. Audio volumes are all screwed up too, sometimes it's really loud and certain sound you can barely hear. If you alt-tab then the game may break your PC and you're forced to restart Windows.The game itself is pretty mediocre. The environmental destruction is really cool at times but also hinders your sight so much that it becomes annoying to use. There's not really much else to it, it's fun for a few episodes but once you've seen every level and mode, you wish you could play Burnout/NFS instead.			"

												In concept, this game is great. Races plus explosions. That carries the game for a while, even if rubberbanding means your results are a bit random. Unfortunately, midway through the campaign, the pacing and vehicle physics fall apart. I'm currently stuck in the 6th episode with options to race cars that either are too slow to compete or that have handling that makes it drive like I'm on ice. Every race I try to run to advance involves watching everyone drive away at the start lineor long sections of the race where control is taken away from me as my car glides around the track like this was a vehicular curling simulator. Some fun to be had, but ultimately disappointing.			"

												First of all, this game DOES NOT have full controller support. You need to first complete the racing tutorial and navigate the menu with your keyboard. You then have to manually select joypad to enable your controller...but you're not done yet. You'll have to bind every action manually as well, on your controller. The only time you can then use the controller is while you're racing. That sounds like ""PARTIAL"" controller support to me.Racing experience: This game is no better than the mobile game series Asphalt, in that the controls are just as basic, and dare I say the car/racing physics in this game could even learn a thing or two from Asphalt. At $20, I was incredibly disappointed and was really wishing Steam had some sort of refund service for when you buy a crap game. I ended up uninstalling this, and really don't ever see myself wasting my HDD space by reinstalling it ever again. Save your money on much, much better racers.The good: Graphics aren't bad. Similar looking to Burnout Revenge. The destructive elements are cool, but gimmicky. You can at least use the controller to drive (after setup).			"

												if time flies when you're having fun, then it says something that every 1 hour session feels like it has been 3-4 hours.what isn't necessarily a bad idea is unfortunately crippled by poor execution. locked at 30fps and crashing on resolution change, I searched for a fix for my resolution crash, but I mostly found a large amount of people complaining that the game crashes on start for them. there have been no patches released to fix either of these issues. infact, no patches have been released at all! small gripe, but alt tabbing out also crashes the game.the AI has a -really- bad case of rubberbanding. they're given cars that are generally a tier above what you're currently given and so you have to use the ""powerplay"" feature (where you attempt to use the enviornment against the other racers) to try and level the playing field. it's neat, but also annoying when the all-too-common sight of 1-3 cars end up with a 6 second lead ahead of everyone else and your attempts to catch up with them are met with you being ♥♥♥♥ed with by the other racers behind you at every opportunity given to them. if you use a powerplay on someone far away, it'll zoom in to show you their car explode. during this time, you're vulnerable and can't see your car. multiple times now I've destroyed someone and had my car plow into a wall helplessly as the camera zoomed in on someone elses blown up vehicle.some of the event types really could use some revision, such as the avoiding helicopter missile barrages mode and the time trial mode. a mode where you have to avoid helicopter attacks and get bonuses depending on how long you can continue avoiding missiles is a neat concept, but when you're put on a single lane and the helicopter is firing 4 missiles horizontally across said lane with no way to avoid it, the gamemode quickly loses appeal. one of your 3 lives is gone and your combo is lost because the game gave you no way to avoid what it tossed at you. the time trial mode is brought down by the fact that you have to deal with powerplays being thrown at you during them. it usually gives you either a drifty car or one with poor handling for these events and so getting a good time on them will probably consist of trial and error where you hit a powerplay you couldn't have avoided (unless you knew it was coming, but sometimes it puts you on an entirely new map where you have no way of expecting some of the things it throws at you), exploding, restarting, and seeing how far you get the next time before another powerplay destroys you before your vehicle has a chance to move out of the way.the sound is depressingly low quality and your graphics options are limited to simply ""low"", ""medium"", ""high"", and ""very high"" with no way to customize them beyond that. even on very high, it really shows that the game is a ps3 port as the graphics are very much last generation. all these problems with the game are a damn shame because it really is a game that had a lot of potential. instead, it manages to be considerably worse than even ridge racer unbounded, which I was still able to enjoy despite all of its flaws. split/second? not so much. the flaws are too many and shine too bright for me to enjoy it for any real length of time.the menus are messy and lacking. for example, if you want to look at the new car you got and change its paintjob or even just exit the game after completing an event, that means restarting the race, pausing, and returning to the main menu because there is no option to just return to the main menu after completing an event. admittedly the load times aren't that bad, but it's just absurd to have to go through such steps to do something so basic.I'd recommend this game for $10 at the -absolute- most. anything above that is really not worth it. it's frustrating, blatantly unfair at times, outdated looking, and generally unpleasant as a racing game. don't expect multiplayer either if that's your thing as the mp servers have been shut down. your only hope of mp is using a third party program to connect to friends over lan. on the bright side, if the bright lights from explosions are highly amusing to you, then this may very well be worth the price to you.ps: who even puts unskippable cutscenes in a racing game? yeesh.UPDATE: aaaaand half way into the game, my save is now corrupted. this feels like the most fitting way this could have ended.

												After a little under 2 hours, I decided to return this game. It felt slow and clunky. Oddly, despite all kinds of explosions and over-the-top visuals, it just didn't excite me at all. The vehicles handle okay, but it made me feel like I was in a plastic toy car, rather than something with a couple tons weight to it. And drifting seemed to slow you down more than be an efficient way to take corners.The audio was poor, even annoying at points. There's this weird, loud whooshing noise, specially in tunnels. It's not when you just barely miss something either. It's just... there. The music is just insultingly generic.			"

												I bought it but cannot play since after the intro, it crashes to the desktop. There are more people like me if you search in steam forums. And this is valid for STEAM version only. I have the DVD retail version and it works fine. Please do not buy this game from steam!Note: If you copy the exe version of the retail DVD to the steam folder, it works.I cannot believe how lazy the developers are that they still haven't implemented this easy fix...

												Short review: Capped at 30FPS with added stutter, but quite enjoyable. Rather buy Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed.I bought this game here on Steam after having pirated it a while ago due to it being difficult to legally acqire my side of the world. I had a crappier PC back then, and it would not run very fast (or so I thought). Having a newer PC now gave me more reason to replay this. After playing titles such as Battlefield 4, DiRT 3, Bioshock Infinite on very high graphical specs with a silky smooth framerate, I expected this game to look extra silky smooth; Boy was I wrong, the framerate is capped at 30FPS and there is noticable stutter on top of that.All in all, it is a very enjoyable racing game, I like the mechanics and I absolutely love the sound effects in the game, when you drive through tunnels, it honestly feels like the wind is rushing through your hair sometimes; albeit the immersion breaking FPS. The audio does have noticable compression artefacts. The online servers have long since been shut down, but split screen is still available.If you are looking for a racing game with similar mechanics, rather go for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed			"

												This game is similar to those virtual reality arcade games from the late 90's: horrible, sticky controls, graphics all over the spectrum, and a game design that won't let you escape.When I bought this game in febuary of 2015, the reviews praised this game, and there was not one downvote on the whole site. I was aprehensive at the Disney Logo appearing upon booting up the game, because they did a very good job of not letting that slip on the store page. it just went downhill from there. the game immidiately throws you into a tutorial without further explination. as it teaches you to drive, it rattles off the game's interpretation on a tired, cliche plot. (Smash T.V , anyone?) an additional note; the game's default key mapping uses the arrow keys, which i find horrid. not only that, but it also disables the mouse. good luck learning how to navigate the 80 billion menus with your puny little arrow keys.anyway, so it takes you around the track at least twice. my indifinitiveness is based on the fact that i did not complete the tutorial. the game called for a key i did not have access to, and so i had to abort the tutorial. good thing you CAN NEVER GO BACK TO IT AGAIN.So, once I left the tutorial, I was greeted with a menu that is cut-and-pasted out of Ridge Racer. Now, I dont know which came out first, but considering the impression R Racer had left on me, my confidince in the game was dropping like Seattle's Space Needle in level 2. But I'm getting ahead of myself.The game comes with this 'revolutionary' autosave feature, that can identify when something has changed or not. not very well, i might add. the autosave means that you get 0 feedback from the menus, which resulted in me having to restart the first race 4 times to get my key mapping saved. when you enter the race (after 4 or 5 more menus, at least), you get a few vehicle options. a muscle car with poor acceleration, a truck with poor acceleration, or a lamborghini bootleg thats faster than hell but is made out of balsa wood. you can guerentee getting destroyed at least 3 times on the first lap.as soon as you start the race (two more menus later), something becomes painfully obvious. three-second cutscenes are the latest, greatest thing (or thats what the developers thought). This game has these tiny cut scenes everywhere, and they rapidly begin to get old. but thats not the irritating thing. You cant skip these Random-camera-angle anthologies. instead, pushing 'enter' or 'space' will bring up the pause menu. that means instead of skipping some pointless Replay, you may restart the race, or even exit to the main menu unintentionally. So you say to yourself; ""ok. i can put up with annoying game design. but how is the control?""think of it this way: every car is a mercedesIf you have never driven a mercedes, all i am saying is the car control is as floaty as a cheap balloon puppy from a B- list clown. you slide all over the place when you drive, so much so that its actually a mechanic. I am sure they only incorperated 'Drifting' into the game to overcome the top-heavy, tractionless vehicles. its bad enough as is, but the steering is even worse. it seems to me that steering was programmed at one tragectory, and if you're going too slow or too fast, steering is going to feel extremely heavy. so if you come to a stop, consider the race over, because even tapping to go left will drag your car all the way to one side, preventing you from going straight.For the finale, lets talk about the focus of the game, because half of you out there own it just because you saw explosions on the thumbnail.yes, there are explosions, and for the most part, it is very satisfing to see chunks of flaming metal rip apart the opposing cars. even the trigger mechanic works well, allowing some challenge timing-wise while not becoming frustrating. the only mechanic that doesnt work well is the indication on what IS blowing up. in fact, there is none. you'll trigger an explosion, and for 2 seconds blue text will tell you you did just that. but it wont tell you where it is, or how big, which can often lead to you blowing yourself up. in addition, being in first place leaves you nearly defenceless, because it is nearly impossible to target backwards and drive forwards.

												Split/Second is a racing game. Or at least that's what it's creators would like you to believe.I affectionately call these titles 'modern' racing games, because they have very little do with racing or playing a game.It's more like watching a movie while you steer a brick of lead with soap wheels through a QTE filled landscape of different shades of brown rubble.Unlike most other racing games, skill plays almost no part in whether or not you win a race. The AI rubber bands to an incredible degree and seems to only ever target you with Powerplays, meaning opening up the alternate routes while you're in the lead is a terrible idea, since it just gives the AI more ammo to fire at you.The pace of the game is barely above a crawl, with the difference between the 1-Speed cars and the 5-Speed cars being almost negligible. I never bothered unlocking anything higher. Drifting also serves to slow this down even more, so if you hope to win any races, don't let go of the accelerator ever. Not that you would really need to.You often have nothing to do with the Power you accumulate while in the lead. You can't activate Powerplays that are behind you or boost. Often just leaving you a sitting duck.The powerplays themselves range from explosions to bigger explosions. Sometimes you can activate shortcuts but usually the game won't let you. I assume this has to do with this game's overarching theme of punishing you for being too good at it.You'll often find yourself in first place, sailing 5 seconds ahead of the rest of the pack for them to fly past you at warp speed 300 feet before the finish line to just immediately slow to a crawl. However if you smash into walls the entire race, hang back and draft to activate Powerplays and are sitting in 2nd or 3rd before the finish, you'll usually win. The Air Strike mode also has an amusing tendency to decide you're going 'too slow' around a hairpin corner and just fire a salvo of missiles at you.The Elite Races are just races where you go up against cars that are much better than yours. While the expectation is that you'll come back to these races later with a faster car, I was often able to beat them on the first or second try. I had enough series points that I was unlocking the next elite race immediately after finishing the last one, which just shows how poor the pacing in this game really is.Overall, I would say that this game doesn't even manage to make it's own gimmick, literally being that you are playing a stunt driver in a TV show, interesting or engaging. The recurring set pieces and genuinely horrible AI make for an uninteresting and uninspired racing game lacking any substance, but much of the flair we have come to expect from say, a Michael Bay movie or a McDonald's Cheeseburger.The fact that this game influenced an entire genre to effectively commit suicide by copying it's sluggish gameplay, brown city environments and severe lack of speed is shocking. Thank the Indies that we have games like Drift Stage and 90s Arcade Racer to look forward to.			"

												Overall, I really liked the game when I played the demo on ps3, and I am definitely not the biggest fan when it comes to racing games. Got it again right before the Lunar Sale ended for feels.Wasnt expecting a 30fps cap, at that point I don't see much of a difference between playing this on console or PC. Not that I can't just hook up a 360 controller (provided it actually supports it anyway), but I had forgotten the different races this had during the Season game mode. I abhor elimination and whichever one deals with those damn trucks and barrels.I don't feel like reliving that rage, though ultimately I would recommend this to anyone wanting a fast pace racing game that looks good and has nukes going off every 5 seconds.

												This game is awesome in everyway. The way that every racer can trigger an explosion on the racetrack and take out other racers while doing that is brilliant.The controls even feels responsive. For people who like racing, destruction, and explosions, you have to buy this game.			"

												Great game yes, but don't say 'Full controller support' when it doesn't.You have to configure your controller and you can only use it during a race, everything else is navigated via the keyboard. So, the main reason I'm won't recommend is because of the controller. Other than that, it's a good game.			"

												I love this game but i just cant get into it on pc due to it not detecting my controller, the pc controls are okay but it just feels clunky without a controller, which is a shame because i played a fair amount of it on xbox 360 and was hoping to be able to enjoy it again			"

												Overall, I really liked the game when I played the demo on ps3, and I am definitely not the biggest fan when it comes to racing games. Got it again right before the Lunar Sale ended for feels.Wasnt expecting a 30fps cap, at that point I don't see much of a difference between playing this on console or PC. Not that I can't just hook up a 360 controller (provided it actually supports it anyway), but I had forgotten the different races this had during the Season game mode. I abhor elimination and whichever one deals with those damn trucks and barrels.I don't feel like reliving that rage, though ultimately I would recommend this to anyone wanting a fast pace racing game that looks good and has nukes going off every 5 seconds.

												One of the best action-racing game I have played, other being Blur, both came around same time I think.Comparison with Death Race movie can be obvious, but I think Blur is more like it.Game looks good, driving is fun, there are lot of race types.Split screen local player inclusion is good.Racing games should have this feature, especially with people having multiple monitors and even 21:9 ultrawide monitors, split screen racing is quite enjoyable.2 Things bother me though,30 FPS lock, It is obviously noticable when game feels slow in high speed action packed moments.Slow menu transitions.

												I would give this a recommend AT YOUR OWN RISK...At this moment of time i'm, in the last race of the third season and i am ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with this ♥♥♥♥ing game i mean the AIs will always catch up with you no matter what, you wreck them and 5 seconds later ohhhhh there they are on your tail again and oops there they go passing you. The worst part is it is close to impossible to beat this game with skill you probably need to get a faster car to actually get first in the normal races let alone the elite races, and let me tell you i have the best car unlocked so far and its doing jackshit for me.So TL;DR, get it if you want to get frustrated out of your mind but for a fun experience when you are actually racing on equal footing			"

												 The chaotic race is ahead of you! Avoiding crash by a centimeter, dodging obstacles by point one second, all for the glory. Get ready, It's time to split seconds.+) Thrilling race.+) Various cars and how you can win them motivates you through the seasons.+) Getting to know how to control each cars and finding what suits you best is really fun.-) There aren't that many maps if you consider the number of seasons.-) You can't quite distinguish what is ahead of you. Maybe it's just because of the speed but It's really hard to recognize what's out there, especially in the beginning of the game.			"

Then don't wait a Split Second!! *See what i did there*It's super fun the AI is pretty difficult to beat at times mostly easyish but the cars are easy to handle and drive arcady *But that's a good thing in a game like this* Cars grip the road really nicely and feel weighted. The camera motion behind the car helps with that.I fully recomend this game for £14.99 any cheaper it's a bargain!			"

												Split/Second seems to hold pretty good, even at 4K ( through DRS ). The frame rate is limited to 30 fps, with very basic graphic options included, but gpu utilization is better than many many many AAA releases of 2016. Take the word of many people here, in a big discount, it's totally worth trying. What's, in my opinion, unique about it, it's probably that it's mechanics - design - and gameplay are much more closer to a PlayStation 2 era racer. I don't think I can actually pinpoint exactly what that means, but it's a pretty distinct feeling. // just first impressions, maybe, probably, someday update			"

												30fps cap is a problem, but the only problem. A wonderful racing game - while the racing mechanics themselves are fairly standard, you get power plays which allow you to explode the track on a small (explode a small car) or big (crash an aeroplane into the track) scale to take out your opponents. The main campaign mode uses the various different game modes to keep it interesting. Would be better if there was another track or two as it seems lacking, but very enjoyable nonetheless.			"

												Probably one of my favorite games since Burnout Revenge. Its an  unforgiving  arcade race with landmines you earn by ♥♥♥♥ing over other drivers, kinda like Mario Kart, but the landmines change the entire level by triggering them. In a close race this is either beautiful or a cluster ♥♥♥♥. It also has bonus levels, cars, skins and other♥♥♥♥♥♥to keep you smiling.			"

												Oh my gosh, this game is so cool! This was one of the first games I played on my own Xbox 360, and I got pretty far in it. Playing it now, I was able to not only relive memories, but remember why I loved this game so much. It's so good, and it feels good playing it. You drive in races and learn to master your car, building up a meter by drifting and drafting and such. You can then use this meter to create destruction in an effort to destroy your rivals and take the lead. You can also use this ability to create shortcuts and alternate routes for yourself. Not only is it satisfying taking down a bunch of rivals in the course, but it also makes being ahead the most intense and nerve wracking thing; you would have drivers behind you who want your position, and can take it at any time by force if you're not careful.The whole thing is set like a tv show, with ""episodes"" featuring several events each. This adds to a feeling of you being an action hero or movie star; the whole thing made me feel like a badass. I've said it to friends before and I'll say it on this review; this game is amazing! No steam achievements, but there are in-game ones which add decals to your car, which I think is a clever addition. It feels like battle scars or what you would see on the uniform of a seasoned veteran; your progress is literal and visual.Graphics wise, I think it looks pretty cool considering this was 2010. Some people have a problem with the frames not being 60 FPS, but I think it just makes it feel even more movie-like with the way that it is! The soundtrack is also incredible as well, and I think it's dynamic to events on the track as well. All in all, Split/Second is an absolute blast to play. Worth the full price for sure!			"

												Stuff is blowing up left and right and the AI is mean and wants you to loose! I really like the concept, the graphics and the soundtrack. But the game is unfair a lot of times: In the last round, shortly before the finnish line a bot will just pass you and it's mostly a Pickup and if you take it yourself, you will even have a hard time to get to the 7th place. And that Hellicopter mode is insane. It sometimes drops so many rockets, that it's impossible to avoid them and you will die by the shock wave alone. But all together it is a pretty cool racing game and beating it was a fun time.			"

												The port of this game is a bit lacking, but can easily be fixed with a few patches. If you can go through the hassle of doing so you have a pretty damn fun arcade racer on your hands here. Definetly one of the better arcade racers on PC, and one which needs a sequel too. Definetly give it a try if you want a fun, action packed racing game.			"
