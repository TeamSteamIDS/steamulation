												I just played the trilogy recently.  The 3rd one has problems.-They changed the control scheme on it.  ...Probably for the better, but still.-The Eagle doesn't feel quite as powerful in it as it did in the previous ones.  ...Which is again is probably for the better, since you basically never have to swap out the Eagle until late game in them.-The time limit maxes out at 4 minutes.  And not just ""maxes out the display"" and keeps rolling, but actually taps out at 4 minutes.  THIS is my biggest complaint with it.  You are basically forced to keep going in it, you never get a chance to really sit back and explore.  I like exploring the levels.  Pedestrians also give you almost no time.-The missions.  They were every other level here, not every 4th level like in the previous game.  They also... I dunno, mostly were uninspired?  They're not bad, but they seemed to be fairly bland, particularly early on.  They are hit and miss overall.Two other issues:  This game includes the Nosebleed Pack.  Now, it's nice in that ""more cars, more maps, more content!""  However, these vehicles are not well balanced, and are available from the beginning.  And are available in the opponent's pool from the beginning.  And the hovering car can be very, very annoying to deal with.Another issue is that the game crashes on story missions.  This is a known issue.  There is a workaround.  The workaround is to turn off the mip filter.  HOWEVER, due to another glitch, that being badly coded menus where the content doesn't contain itself to the windows, you can't actually turn off the mip filter in game.You CAN do it from the setup though.  So open the setup, go to options, video, advance, and where you see ""Mip filter"", set it to none.  You may also need to disable Pixel Fog (though I didn't need to).  This should fix the problem.There's a lot to like about the third game though.  The graphics are a big step up.  The final levels in this game really look fantastic.  The story IS there, even if it's annoying at times.My favorite of the bunch is the second.  The third has problems.  So, why am I giving this a ""yes"" recommendation, despite all the flaws, including crashes?  Because, at the end of the day, it's still Carmageddon.  And if you need to get your fix, there ya go.

												Nobby (lead dev of carmageddon)  wont like hearing this, but I actually liked this game. Sure, it was Carmageddon 2, it was just another game slapped on the Carma franchise, but as a Kid, I didnt mind, Even though STEAM shows 10 mins or so played, I have finished this game 2-3 times when it first came out. its a lot of fun if you let of the fact that its not a CARMA 3, its an destrruction derby game...

												Well, the game itself is not worth $5 but I feel some nostalgia while playing it and that, my friends, is priceless. Recommended if you played it 14 years ago and you want to reminisce, otherwise, save your money for Carmageddon Reincarnation and you'll get TDR 2000 anyway.			"

												I played this game a years ago, I've also played the original Carmageddon and other sequels as well as Carmageddon Reincarnation. I got this for free because I own the latter. I just booted this up for 15 minutes last night to check it out after all this time and do a quick video on the game.


YouTube™ Video: Carmageddon TDR 2000 gameplay NOT A CAR RACING GAME FOR YOUR KIDS 

			Views: 539		



In my mind my memories of this game looked a lot better graphically, 3D models are awful lol This didn't stop me enjoying the game though! (even now).If you don't already know this is car racing game. You can finish matches by completing a number of laps around courses. But Carmageddon's thing is running people over. You get points for it and extra time. Which sounds god damn awful lol but it's not as bad as it sounds when you play the game (btw I played these mostly when I was a kid - Carmageddon taught me all about life lol).Carmageddon TDR 2000 has aged but is still fun to play.

												Amazing game. When I was like 10 years old I did not like that game, because Carmageddon 1 and 2 looked for me way better, but later I realized that this game is great in every aspect:+Soon to be 20 years old this game has amazing graphics and back in old days, it was beautiful.+Various cars to play and upgrades: ofcourse the default car is the best and easiest to play, but you can buy all the other cars you play vs - even the boss! And try to beat the game with them.+Various difficulties - which are really different, the hardest one provide boss units at the early levels, can you imagine?+Beat the game various ways - kill enough pedestrians, destroy all the enemies or win the race.+Dark postapocalyptic atmosphere and color schemeInteresting campaign for a racing game provides loads of fun. This game is old AF yet its better than a lot of modern games. And if you manage to find an old PC to run it properly or tweak it enough to run on the modern one, you will have a lot of good time.

												carma games were always dear to my heart. The races were jus plain fun for the fact you didnt have to race if you didnt want to. However the missions could be very challenging. I wouldent recommend this game to anyone too serious as this is not a serious game, It is serious fun. Multiplayer is awesome fun. Missing the soundtrack however somewhat disappointing. I would recommend this game to anyone  whos never tried it . Its a smashing good time.			"

												I am glad to see this game on Steam. I used to play this back when lan parties were a thing, back in the days of 2004. Me and my mates would run that map with the 4 spires and the grinder in the center, and we would spend hours just trying to get the nukes on the top of the spires. Kangaroo on Command man, that♥♥♥♥♥♥was the bomb.Anyway, back to my review. The game crashes from time to time, which is to be expected from such an old game. I'm gonna try forcing DirectX 9 mode on it, and starting up with -nod3d10. If the developers could give us some tips on how we could circumvent DirectX issues... that would be lovely.10/10 game. Anyone who tells you its♥♥♥♥♥♥probably hasn't played past The Boulevard.EDIT: Dont use -nod3d10, its not supported. Sad face.			"

												While many people hate this and say that this is the worst carmageddon, I don't agree. Back when it came out for me it was great succesor to carmageddon 2. I really liked its atmsophere, level design and postapocalyptic setting. Well it was a long time ago and then these graphic's looked ok and I imagined these cities filled with weird slum people. The only area where it lacks comapred to carmageddon 2 is the damage physics, because in tdr theay ar pretty weak. There is car spliting and stuff but it just doesn't work that well. Improvements over original carma:Wheels fall of-Ped attack you with dynamite and molotows, there are also baricades built by them on some rodas-Cops only come if you start waisting you oponents and I gues when you kill many peds and if you are really bad thay call the suppressors :]-There are cool new powerups: Wheel spikes, hower car witch also lets you hower above the watter, meteor storm, nuclear bomb.- Level design (grim cities acompanied by trippy sounds really makes great atmosphere)- Pretty good tracked whicle technology for its time- Backstory (its minimal, but makes you imgaine things about the world yourself)- Bouncing boobs animationNote:If your game crashes wjile loding missions, disable mip filter.

												If you are a fan of the original games on the PC then this will probably not hit the mark. The collisions have no real substance to them, the graphics are almost cartoon like and overall it just feels like a safe for kids version of the classic carmageddon. Good for 5min but it has none of the originals charm and I doubt I will spend hours trying to eliminate the drives in an attempt to win there cars like I used too. In fact I just finished the race on my first run before turning it off... Bad item layout, not enough pedestrians, cartoon like graphics, stupid pop off armor and the maps just feel smaller and not as well designed. They made a fun car smashing game into a crappy racing game with bad maps 4/10			"

												This game might not have al the soul of the first two but it seems to hold up better since it used a more recent engine. I sort of wish the would update all the games to work better with the new systems but I am not going to argue with what I get with this game since it is still damn fun!			"

												Carmageddon TDR 2000 is a fun game,once you become acustomed to its idiosynchrocies.  Most modern computers experience a glitch caused by an antiquated Mip map and vertex fog better handled by Voodoo Rush and TNT Riva cards of yesteryear.  The fix is simple: backup your game cache through Steam first. browse Local Files, Open GFX file with Word Pad. Scroll to line 74 and edit line which reads all twos. Change last two to a zero, Save and done. The game has 25 races and 25 missions. For help with missions check out ZodApe's YewTewb Channel. I have seen complaints on here about the game is broken,too hard,not enough time etc.  Yet i imagine these same complainers plow happily throught the latest NFS broken crap because the Dice Team made it and they made Call of Droopy Diaties. Blow that!  Need more money to buy that sweet Hotty? Try racing the first level in The 20's and for the love of Pete,mow down every ped on the sidewalks. Keep  those Combo Multiplies spinning and you will make serious bank ~ $250K - $600K per play through.  Race it over and over until you have serious ends. Also the Train Station generously has Armor,Power and Slots All Around so you need not buy those,merely fill them for more even more nefarious power. Do You need more time? Use a bigger and slower car to hammer the competition. The ""Jaws"" car is a personal fave. Most Opponent Wasteds yield an extra minute and sometimes more added game play time.  Is this game for everyone? Hell no! You have to work hard to succeed. Without some skin in the game there can be no reward. This is a game from fifteen years  past when games were brutal but satisfying because you felt like you had accomplished something. if it is too hard then maybe Mario Kart or one of it's Brawzillion spinoffs is a better bet for you. Thanks for reading,be safe,keep well and happy gaming Playa.			"

												Well, sure it's not like the first two games but you can still have fun playing it. I really liked the car designs (i love the mad max's cars)  and the scenarios (running people over in the 20s is quite fun).  Might not be the best of them all but i don't think it's as bad as they say.			"

												Carmageddon is probably one of the most enjoyable racing games i have ever played.Don't get me wrong, yes, Forza looks good. Yes, Flatout has fun damage and somewhat realistic, yes, micromachines has weapons, but with this game the whole atmosphere makes it enjoyable. Yes! The graphics are bad! Yes, the sounds are terrible and are extremely loud! But who cares! This game was released in 2000! That was a year before the first Xbox! AND STILL THIS GAME IS MORE ENJOYABLE THEN GAMES COMING OUT ON THE XBOX ONE AND PLAYSTATION4!Get this game. Play it with your friends. Should work multi-player, if not, I'm sure you can set up a Vlan and play with them.			"
