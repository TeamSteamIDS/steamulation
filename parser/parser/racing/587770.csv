												      喜欢4X4越野的朋友可以关闭页面了，这个游戏是小作坊做出来的，抱着对独立游戏支持的态度买了，屎一样的驾驶体验，Unity3D引擎写的，写的很差劲，UI根本就是随手画的，完全没有诚意的作品，玩了10分钟，忍受不了，我也是个Unity开发者，看到这种作品上架STEAM，对4X4游戏的未来产生了严重的怀疑。Like 4 x4 cross-country friends can close the page, the game is to make small workshops, holding the attitude to support independent games bought, excrement as driving experience, written Unity3D engine, write very bad, the UI is a draw, no sincerity to work, to play for 10 minutes, can't stand, I am also a Unity developers, see this kind of work on STEAM, the future of 4 x4 game produced serious doubt.

												So, if you are a hard core gamer, or racer, or would prefer to stick an ice pick through your hands for pleasure while splashing in salt water, this game is not for you.  Now, I got it because I have a 2 1/2 year old that likes car games and at $5, I kept my expectations low...  and graphis settings for that matter...  And... this does fit the defintion of a ""Car game"" and it kept his attention for just over a half hour that I enjoyed spending with him, not the game.  Afterwards, he wandered off and I was gleeful to turn it off.Now the game.  If you like driving on the ""preferred"" path, its pretty straightforward.  But, after a while, you realize that the arrow to guide you to the next gate is fairly accurate, and it is more rewarding to just drive off the cliff and land next to the desired gate, and save yourself the agony of trying to drive it, unless you hit anything like tree branches, or rocks or imaginary walls.  The vehicles all pretty much drive the same, which is floaty, bouncy vehicles that accelerate like something out of a formula one game.  So, good luck staying on the trails if you hold down the ""w"" or forward arrow.  Though, it is laughable to do so to see if you truly can stay on the trail.  Damage to your vehicle does not degrade its performance and yeah.  I rate this between why my navel lint is blue, and why my son refuses to take a nap.  Maybe he needs to watch me play this more...
