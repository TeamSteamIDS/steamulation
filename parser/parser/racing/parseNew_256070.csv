												This game is way more fun than it should be. The trucks actually have nice damage, and the leveling is nice on each vehicle, but the game seems overly easy and can be nearly beaten in 2-3 sit downs.			"

												First off if you're looking for a sim truck racing game, then don't bother with this game. If you're looking for a fun arcade racer with trucks then this is the game for you. The game is a blast to play once you get the hang of the trucks. The physics in the game are actually quite good and the trucks handle nicely to boot. You can choose between 6 trucks in championship mode and all can be upgraded. You have 2 types of roads with dirt and asphalt with dirt having a slight loose feel to it but still feels the same as asphalt. You can upgrade the tracks for both dirt and asphalt but I just set one up for dirt and another for asphalt. For multiplayer I can't tell you how it is since its basicly dead. But for a pretty fun racing game, this is a blast.			"

												Most important thing - ""Truck Racer"" is not a simulator. This is arcade style racing game like Dirt 3, but with trucks. Multiplayer is dead so do not even count on this part of game. Just forget it like it never existed...You will find only 6 trucks but you can customize them in many ways, also number of racingtracks is not bad because all of them have multiple variations with diffirent routes. For a player most important is fun - and for now I've found a lots of it - steering is very intuitive and implemented damage system is more than enough for game like this one. Seriously - last time I had fun like this when I played Dirt 3 for a first time. :-)7.5/10			"

												This MONDAY, MONDAY, MONDAY, throw in some Truck Racer to race TRUCKS or any day really.  Get in a Big rig of steel, just like Euro Truck Sim, except now with 100% more racing!  Menus are easy to navigate, probably one of the best UI's made in a long time.  All the menus are awesome, they flow really easily, not much of a learning curve for people familiar with race games.  Best part is I havent noticed that rubber band AI stuff, where one accident spells doom as evry car races past you but no matter how good you do they are always catching up.  In fact they crash and all kinds of amusing stuff catching up.  The races arent too long, so its easy to play a round then go do something and then pick it up again later.  Loads of customization, other trucks, and upgrades keep the game interesting. Rating:  10/10  Value:  $24.99			"

												I would like to be neutral with this game, I would not recommand to spend 20€ on this game; if you can get it for less than 10 bucks, then go on. Else it doesn't really worth this price.First: the handling. I wasn't expecting an arcade-style driving since the game looked realistic and didn't take a totally frenzy atmosphere. I mean, games like Flatout or Burnout are realistic-looking but you can easily tell they're focused on the fun part of destructing vehicules like ""you can explode every cars in the crossroad/make you driver fly"" and then don't expect any realism from the handling. Truck Racer goes ""You're gonna race with trucks. Period."", and since there is not really that much of truck racing game lately, I was expecting stuff like Gran Turismo or at least Race Driver GRID with trucks.And even for an arcade handling it's really a weird one, like ""you can drift but not steer into the skid but if you drift too much then your truck will spin"", and also, the truck going full speed and taking some tight curve with no difficulty by the magic boost.Secondly: the difficulty. Let's face it: the game is way too easy. The bots let themselves being lapped by the first truck you can afford without any upgrades, then you become milionnaire after one tournament, and even if the devs desesperatly tried to harden the game by letting the biggest upgrades only avalaible if you have bought every other upgrades before, it doesn't make the game any harder, in fact, it makes the upgrade system completely annoying. There is also a damage bar but it goes down really slowly and I ♥♥♥♥ing tried to destroy my truck by smashing it on the contestants but every time I finished the race before my truck was totalled.And lastly: the content. So there is a bunch of tracks with their variations, all good, the tracks looks alike a bit but no big deal. The real problem here is that there is ONLY 6 ♥♥♥♥ING TRUCKS! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS GAME WAS RELEASED IN 2013, NOT 1997! And all of thoses trucks actually looks the same with a little difference between every one of them. They're all arranged like this: the beginner's trucks (high handling and low speed), the asphalt one, the dirt one; the average trucks, the asphalt one, the dirt one, and the advanced trucks (high speed and low handling), the asphalt one, the... you got it?But then it's make really little difference since you can beat the game with every one of them. And then the game is really flat and quickly boring after a couple of hours.A good point: not a single bug in sight. At least the game was finished at its release.			"

												Truck Racer does exactly what its title suggests: There are trucks, and you race them. Generic title aside, Truck Racer is a fairly good arcade-oriented big rig racing game that is held back by a lack of difficulty and empty multiplayer lobbies. If you must buy it, wait for a sale.Truck Racer follows the standard racing game blueprint: you race transport trucks through a series of increasingly difficult tournaments, trying to earn enough credits to unlock the next tournament. Credits earned can be used to purchase new trucks and unlock better performance parts. There are six trucks to choose from and quite a few different parts to unlock, and it's fun mixing and matching components to get the best possible performance out of your vehicles.The racing in Truck Racer is decent, with good course design and responsive controls. There's lots of banging and crashing as the trucks battle for position; expect to see lots of pileups and parts littering the tracks. Trucks can get damaged, but damage doesn't seem to affect handling. It's possible for trucks to take enough damage to render them useless, but don't expect it to happen even once over the course of the eight or so hours it takes to complete Truck Racer's career mode. Since it's an arcade-oriented racer, the physics in Truck Racer are a bit more relaxed. The trucks drift fairly easily, and crashes   that should flip the truck never will. This keeps the action moving along, although somewhat curiously Truck Racer doesn't have a ""reset to track"" feature, which means if your truck spins out and you're facing in the wrong direction, you'll have to slowly back up and get back on the track manually.Truck Racer's biggest problem is its level of difficulty. This is an easy racing game. You'll finish atop the podium in every race the first time you race it. Part of this is due to the game's AI: computer-controlled racers are kind of dumb, and they have real problems getting unstuck from accidents. While the other trucks are trying to get going again after a pileup, you'll leave them in the dust and the lack of rubber-banding means the other trucks will never catch up to you. Expect to win many races by more than 30 seconds. Even on Expert difficulty, Truck Racer is a breeze.Live competition would cancel out the bad AI in Truck Racer's single-player mode, but no one is playing this game online. This means Truck Racer has a short shelf life, unless you know some people who have the game and will play multiplayer. Steam achievements add some extra replay value, for people who are into that sort of thing. There are fifty in all, with most of them obtainable in career mode.Truck Racer is a decent racing game, with the added novelty of being one of the few titles out there that only feature trucks.   It's a good game to pick up in a sale.			"

												To start off I would like to say that I didn't expect much from this game.  It was on sale and I love racing games so I usually try most of them out.  It isn't a realistic racing game, it's more of an arcade style game.  There is a lot to keep you busy from the amount of races to the achievements.  My Xbox controller works really well for the game and I've had no issues with the controls.  Of course there are some flaws in the game but nothing major worth mentioning.  If you enjoy racing games you should pick this up when it goes on sale.			"

												Great fun in a bundle with 8 other games for $4 and well worth it but I wouldn't pay the current listed $20.If you're a serious racing fan and get your thrills with a steering wheel then this isnt for you (but you already knew that and are heading back to Assetto Corsa right now).  If however, you're a fan of racing and can enjoy it lightheartedly with a 360 controller then this title is an entertaining way of whiling away a sunday afternoon.Most cheap racing games suffer badly with clipping with your vehicle being bounced off or speared by invisable barriers but in a couple of hours racing I only had 3 incidents which represented a minor annoyance.  Online achievements will be hard to get without organising with friends but as someone who prefers to play solo I didn't have any issues there.Race your truck, upgrade your truck, smash some trucks and race some more = good times!

												Really bad game. Not even ""so bad it's fun"" or ""oh well it was just a dollar"", just bad.I know what you're thinking. ""Arcade physics, easy drifting, trucks crashing into each other, mostly positive reviews, how can you go wrong with this?""First of all, this is probably a bad port or a poorly optimized game, as the framerate is inconsistent even on low settings.But more importantly, it's just not fun. The overall ""feel"" or handling of the trucks, is neither realistic nor fun. There's a boost mechanic, which charges when you grind with other trucks, but that usually gets you stuck and slows you down more than it should.Also the AI is really bad, and for some reason the 1st truck is always 10+ seconds ahead of the pack, which makes it even harder to catch when you're 2nd since there's no AI around to crash and charge your boost.There's a fair selection of trucks, but they all feel generic and handle the same.All the tracks and environments replicate the same assets and look the same.Oh, and you can't rebind your controller!It doesn't matter if you've set your expectations low or enjoy trash games, this game doesn't have anything to offer.Not sure why there's so many positive reviews, but most of them seem to have no more than 10 hours of gameplay, and for good reason.If you want a great arcade game, with lots of drifting and crashing and hours of fun, get Burnout Paradise instead.If you want a good truck game, get ETS2, or Formula Truck 2013 (not arcade!) if you want a truck racing game.

Doesn't look AAA, doesn't drive AAA but it can be enjoyed if you won't set your expectations too high.+lots of tracks/combinations, night, rain, etc.+damage system.+if you don't hit the roadside, truck-driving can be enjoyable (depends on the truck you bought, the upgrades you applied)+classic gameplay: you race, you earn money, you buy new trucks/upgrades, so you can race on higher class championships-too easy, no difficulity settings-bit repetitive but fortunatelly the whole game isn't that long (completed the career in 6 hours)-sound! truck's engine sound makes me mad :DIf you like arcade racers, especially trucks - buy it! There aren't many options out there.(last truck racer I played (and loved!) was Mercedes Benz Truck Racing)			"

												Pretty decent arcade style racing game.  Not many others out there to compete with it since it is semi truck racing.  The game could be better though such as when you change from asphalt tires to dirt tires the 3D image of the tires on your truck does not change at all.  And it would be nice if there was an achievement for lapping other drivers during a race.  And when you do lap another driver, the game tells you how far that driver is behind you instead of the 2nd place driver (assuming your in 1st place).  Graphics could be a tad bit better as well.  Graphics are not bad but other racing games shine better in comparison.  But hey, what can you expect from a $4 game?  I'm just glad the devs didn't add missle launchers to the trucks (that's just not my style).  I do love the pieces flying off the trucks though when they smash into each other.  If you love racing games and you like trucks, well then stop reading reviews and add this game to your library.			"

A limited number of tracks that you have to ride over and over again, only six cars that are not different one from the other and, on the top of that, idiotic and so unrealistic damage and hit system. Really - don't buy it. Wanted to play it with my friend in coop but would look for something else.			"

												Not a bad game, but the AI is incredibly dumb. This becomes a major issue in harder races because the challenge comes not from better AI, but by having to dodge dead trucks as you overlap opponents on longer races; for harder races, the trucks just go faster without any other adjustments resulting in them knocking themselves or each other out.As others have been stating, the game's achievements are not hard to obtain with the exception of the online achievements since no one is ever online.

												Nothing inherently wrong with the game. Just an over-all meh experience that is generally too easy. And when you progress to the harder levels of the game, ""hard"" = bumper cars. If getting punted all over the race-track by AI-controlled trucks sounds like fun, by all means buy this game. Decent graphics, fair customization and destructible trucks can't make up for the small amount of tracks and locations. Think of it as an arcade game and get it on sale for 75% off, and you probably won't be too disappointed. But there are better racing games out there.			"

												Almost a total rip off. Must be played with keyboard controls. Overall, not very interesting.			"

												Not a full price game, but a HEFTY, MACHO, YORKIE bit of gaming, The feel of weight, accurate damage and hilarious crashes make for rubber burnin' mayhem.It aint fast, but it sure rocks. Even the pink truck would beat the crap out of the likes of GT or GRID's slinky little sunday saloons.I'm off to punch some iron.			"

												This game plays pretty similar to Flatout. It's called Truck Racer. You race trucks. There's almost nothing to this game besides arrow keys and a boost button. The AI is INSANELY easy, there isn't a single race event I didn't get 1st place in my first time around, usually by 30-60 seconds. You will lap the AI multiple times, but the drifty physics make it still fun to drive around the short tracks. I played through the campaign in 5 hours, although the game had worn off after 2-3.			"

												Went through 8 installing steps after downloading the game.Ran it.Didn't work.Tried to end process.Didn't work.10/10.After the game worked, while the game did not look that good and clearly is a console port with physically no notable video settings and all, the game is extremely fun. The only major issue is that Asphalt/Dirt balance does not actually seem to matter at all. I still won medium races with the opposite balance car with a notable margin between first place and second place.			"

Premise : i am sorry if my english is not perfect since i am italian and never studied english except from school and college, but i will review the games i play in english, just to reach more people.Pros :            Very cool graphic (even if textures are not high resolution).           Very nice and enjoyable physic and truck controls. Cons :            There is no soundtrack except for the music of the main menu.           The game can be beaten in less then 4 hours.           Can't rotate camera. Final thoughts  :  This game is pretty cool and enjoyable arcade racer, wich could have been a really good rival to the big racing games but it is not since is too short and has no soundtrack at all, but still it is one solid and very funny arcade truck racing game.

												This game really surprised me. It has a really deep tunning and upgrade system which really has a big influence on your trucks performance. The tracks are all laid out well and grow more difficult as you progress through the championship mode, and the game offers around 6 hours of gameplay in that championship mode. All in all a really underrated gem.If you want a more in-depth review

												This game does not know which place you came at the end of the race. I just started, had 3 other in front of me, two of them crashed, which left ONE in first place and me in second place. The end result was stated as me bieng in third place, WTF.			"

												The awful truth is that you have to believe negative rating and reviews despite promising screenshots and video.The game looks just great, interface is stylish, sound is fine, truck models are very nicely detailed, everything seems to be fine, but... ...but the game is unplayable.What renders the game unplayable is simple fact: each truck generates mighty dense smoke, and there is a plenty of trucks racing in championship circuit.There is too much smoke and you barely see where you are driving, consequesntly you hit other trucks and slide away from the road. You can't turn the smoke off. Swicthing the camera makes no difference: still you see nothing but smoke. It cannot be helped. Bottom line: no fun, because you can not play. Yes, that stupid.Note: the game seems to be ported and, at least in my case, experiences strange framerate / speed fluctuations, when the game unexpectedly starts runing too fast from time to time. I've seen other comments about bad porting job done, so this migh be true.			"
