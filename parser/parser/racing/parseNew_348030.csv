Early Access Review
								I have been playing multiplayer games for ~ 20 years now and after all that time i usually don't end up having adrenaline rushes anymore while gaming.. anger.. sometimes.. but not the good adrenaline rushes.but this game.. i just had a race were the competition for place #1 was so close, i was clenching in my chair and hoping that my driver doesn't make any mistake anymore, when i pulled out of pitstop just a car length in front of him, i was so happy and then he overtook me, but i could get back in a corner and it kept going like that, back and forth and then in the last curve he was on my♥♥♥♥♥and his car was faster in the straights, but with a good use of the block feature i just managed to stay first by half a car length.. it was so epic.it doesnt matter if the game has placeholder sound or lacks content at the moment (its early access, remember other reviewers, there will be more stuff added, there is a roadmap posted). the gameplay is right and it is fun and they are on the right way so far for sure it has the thrill, and so far a very nice community that talks to each other and with people appreciating a good fight, hoping for a good race for each other vs the bots.i like it.. i should be playing Witcher 3 or GTA5 and i sit here and play this early access game hour after hour.

Early Access Review
								This review is based on Early Access launch Version:The game is abit bare on Content but that should change as it progresses.  The game itself is pretty solid and fun to play.  It's a mix of the sit back and watch your strategy play out as a ""Manager"" but more involved aswell as you have enough control over what the car does to make quite a difference.This game is Multiplayer Only, which i personally like and enjoy, but those of you looking for a Simgleplayer Experience may not be satisfied with this.the lack of cars/tracks/features aside, this is a pretty solid game and has got alot of potential.  I would Recommend this to those who enjoy Online games where you'r managing a racing team but not quite having direct control of the cars themselves and watching your strategies play out.			"

												240 hours in... best thing i can say is... It's a good idea executed extremely badly.Each new ""patch"" seems to make the game worse and or more glitchy. It was in it's simplest and best form during EA but now it's turned to crap. What pisses me off the most is that on certain tracks the car will just lose traction, jump, slide off line when in reality the car would be stuck to the road. It took them 4 months to repair a bump in the road on Circuit De La Luna... only it wasn't fixed, they had just made it worse and made the car slow down to a stop when you went over it. If this game had been made by actual programmers instead of teenagers in their bedrooms I'm sure most of the racing community would play it, because like i said, it's a good game executed so badly it's embarrasing.

												This game has much potential and the developers are very communicative but right now the game feels like early access and kinda unfinished. Right now there are 6 tracks and 6 cars which seem kinda unbalanced. There is also only one race mode, quick race, right now. If this games expands and gets better I will change my rating accordingly.If you want to support the devs and the potential of this game buy it now - if you want a finished game and you would give up when you see some bugs, please wait and come back later.

Early Access Review
								With only like 2 or 3 hours gametime, I HAVE to write a review! I was around googeling for some Formula One manager, or even some Indycar manager. I did not find an acceptable successor, so I was typing ""manager"" in Steam's searchbar and stumbeled again up on Trackday Manager and gave it a shot. Turns out, this was the best desicion to make! Yes, it iS buggy -sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes a few races no bug at all. Yes, there ARE only two cars by now. Yes, it IS laggy from time to time. But hey, really, this an early access, so those above are for me no big deal at all. The guys at Arctic Hazard are at it and you can imagine them putting their sweat and blood in it. Thats what counts. We are not talking about EA or something with their own money printing machine! And I for one give a♥♥♥♥♥♥of beta versions sold as final releases. This little gem is highly addictive, so I need to type fast to get back into the game. Here's the pro's and con's, for those not willing to read: GO AND BUY IT! NOW! MOVE!Cons: -considering that this is early access, I cannot spot any fair con.  But just to mention: -still a bit laggy-still some, but few, bugs-still some, but extremely rare, uncounted races (due to the bugs)Pros:-gameplay is highly addictive-races are a tactical gem-lovely designed tracks-good number of players online at all (my) times-very nice and helpful communityUnsure if Arctic Hazard finds the time to read this, or if they care for this single opinion, but I would like to state my wishes:  Wishlist-some kind of ingame friendlist (to add and remove friends / chat with friends when in my own garage / group option to start races with friends) "

												TLDR; Cool concept, for a pretty niche community. Unfortnately there's no singleplayer mode and finding other players can take upwards of 10 minutes. Controls can feel unresponsive, but gameplay is genuinely fun. Online community feels dead and the game lacks varitey and customisability.I imagine they'd also be rolling out more updates in the future for more content, as it is there are 6 tracks and 6 different cars. When you start out you have no cars theres 6 to pick from and you have a choice of the first two as they are under 200K which is what you're given when you start out. The car models do look pretty good and was impressed with the details they were able to put into the models. After buying the car you want, take it to your garage and with whatever spare cash you have left you might be able to get an upgrade. The upgradeable aspects of your car are the brake, ECU, Exhaust, bodywork, suspension, KERS, spoiler, cooling and a few others. Upgrades will change the car in terms of fuel economy, top speed, accleration, drag, braking power and do matter. For instance the car I was using was kitted to last only about 25km's without pitting but I had constantly more power to use and ended out on top. Most races won't be longer than 50km's, also note drivers can be more fuel economic whilst driving.Once you're actually in-game it's pretty fun, you instruct your AI driver around and tell him when to use KERS, push harder, when to change the car's fuel map, pitstops and block. Controls can feel like they are unresponsive at times but that's due to driver stats which can be upgrades with experience points.Experience points can be used to increase the speed of certain aspects of your pitstop, increase the skill of your driver; how confident he is with braking and overtaking and how much speed he can carry through corners. You also have a manager who handles all your sponsorship contracts, you can give him greater chance of securing a contract and he can land better contracts for you aswell.Contracts themselves aren't overly fun to handle. You're given 10 time units and every action uses a certain amount of time units, time units are replentished after each race. Pretty easy mechanic but monotonous is a good way to describe sponsorship (10/10 immersion there). To actually land a deal you need to call up the sponsor which you might or might not get through to. Once you're in you can invite them out to dinner, send them gifts, give a presentation on your raceteam few other options I've forgotten. Each option will better the relationship between you and whomever you're chasing up.Once a you manage to squeeze out a contract offer you can change the aspects of the contract, how much you get paid, for how many races and what position you need to come in to adhere to those conditions of receiving the funds.All up I would recommend this game if they added more varitey and the online community was bigger, it's a fairly niche market so this game may never live up to it's full potential. In it's current state I wouldn't recommend this game.Apologies for the length of the review, it all got a bit out of hand. Cheers.			"

												PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE MOTORSPORT AND CIRCUIT RACINGThis game uniquely explores how important it is to properly manage tyres and fuel for pitstops as well as the importance of playing the strengths of cars to their fullest, you must determine when and where to push the car to its limits and when to drive it more economically. You'll be constantly doing math to figure out if you're under or exceeding your fuel quota and you will also be watching the tyre wear so you don't burn them out too fast and make the wear eat into your lap times.To add to the mix you can monitor what actions and strategies the opponents are employing throughout the race, this will sometimes make you rethink your strategy - will you let him pass and tail him or will you run your car at 100% and try to outrun him and if so, for how long? Keep in mind that running the car at full throttle eats into fuel and you'll finish most races with 0% - 5% fuel remaining so choose wisely.The tuning aspect of the game allows you to buy newer and better parts, some more suited for speed and power while others are suited better for handling and fuel economy, the challenge is to build a car that is well adapted for most situations and having strengths that can be used to secure wins. Your team can be upgraded too which consists of a Driver, the Pit Crew and lastly your Marketing Manager who is in charge of obtaining sponsorship deals.The game is still early in development phase and has numerous errors or design faults but it still brings a lot to the table, races are randomly selected and sometimes you will be put into a race where your cars setup has almost no chance of placing within the top 5 not even looking at first, this will be ironed out down the line but can detract from the experience. Pitstop bugs have happened before as well and I've had a few bugs with tyre selection costing me races in the past but I'm willing to overlook them for the time being while the developer fixes then; the developer is very active and open with progress on the steam forums so help is never too far away.And lastly a piece of advice for the people who are considering or have just bought the game and have yet to choose a car: buy the Raptor if you want an easier experience, buy the Avalanche if you want to grind your face into the wall but learn a lot more about strategy and have a greater challenge on the managing side of things. This game is ideal for those who know a lot about racecraft but are looking to expand their knowledge on race strategy.			"

												Has massive potential but it really should be in early access.  For a mainly multiplayer game the net code is really poor, with lag causing the game to be unplayable.

Early Access Review
								In this game you become the manager of your own racing team. You won't find here popular car brands like Ferrari or Maserati but just a fictional racing cars.OverviewAs a team manager you can sign new sponsor offers and help the driver to drive around the track. By earning money out of every race you can then upgrade the car or buy a new color design. The racing itself is from 3rd person perspective so you see a very small cars. As a team manager you can instruct the driver to: overtake, overload, block or tail the following car. The second set of options is: KERS button, changing the engine's ECU fuel mapping or requesting the driver to make a pitstop. Instructing the driver to overtake the following car can be from the left or right side and it works pretty well but sometimes the AI fails causing strange situations. The rest of the options work pretty well.Game modesSingle race or cup mode - new in the game. In the cup mode you also have qualification lap which i felt lacking before. Cup mode provides you also some more fun because of strategy, because there are 3 races that are longer and therefore you can go on one pitstop or two. Balance The game is all the time on the same level. When you start there are many cars faster than you and some of them are slower. It means that after you do the upgrades to the car your car becomes more competetive and heads to the front of the opponents. After you upgrade your car to the maximum you fight for the first places. It means that after you do it your car is always in the front so if you don't have real players as the opponents, you almost always fight for win. There should be some racing categories or one type of car races to make it more interesting.MultiplayerIt's the first issue - because the game doesn't have singleplayer, the game is always looking for online players. Sadly almost all the time you compete with the bots and maybe 1-2 real players.Graphics & audioEverything looks very nice, has good sounds. The music becomes a little boring after 5 or 10 races but you can turn it off. Some optimalizations must be made to the game because of the high cpu/gpu usage, but so far it works nice.SummaryThere are still some bugs like for example disapearing wheels, lapped cars still fight like they were racing while they shouldn't. The game needs some work but the direction is so far very good and i can recommend this game. If you like racing games, you'll definetely like this one!Take a look at the stats of my profile here http://www.trackdaymanager.com/profile/?order=totalScore&nationality=Poland&teamID=1888 "

								Thumbs up for what it is. Was not exactly what I was expecting, but I am still enjoying it. This is not a hardcore management/simulation game, so know that before buying. To me, it feels more like an arcade game with a light management twist on it.Pros:- Lots of time to be sunk into this- Can be played when you only have a half hour or so (low single sitting commitment)- Quite a good looking game- While you don't directly drive the car, the ""skills"" present a highly engaging play style that doesn't have you just ""kicking back and waiting""- When you are against bots, they seem to have a nice range of skillCons:- Low level of content (currently)- Have not seen more than 2 players in a race thus far- A bit too casual for a management, or a simulation, game (not sure which it wants to be, but leans towards casual for either category)- Have run quite a few races and only seen 2 of 5 tracks, making the content level feel even lower right now- Based on income rate and car cost, your ""team"" looks like it will be a single car/driver for longer than many would be willing to play the game (assuming you even can get another car - looks like you can)- No apparent way to ""party"" with someone- You don't know which track you will be racing ahead of time (randomly selected when you join a race) so you have to setup your car in the garage to be an overall setup- Pre-race setup consists of just choosing your tire type (3 basic choices, no fine adjustments)- In-game pit options are fuel refill level and tire type (again, no fine adjustments)Other Thoughts:- Price might seem a bit high right now with the lower amount of content. I am assuming that more will come. Regardless of the low content right now, if you can get into the game, I could see a very good hours/$ return.- A few small issues/bugs, but not bad for an early access and quite a lot better than many other games on early access (and even full release for that matter).- The in-race management is where you spend most of your time. Front office stuff takes a back seat in terms of time spent in game, and front office complexity is quite low.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay here goes my review for this game. I am not a big review writer but I think this game definitely requires a review.It is early access but in saying that the content we have now is extremely entertaining and well worth the money. I cant wait to see what they add in to it.So i have now been playing this for over 30 hours. This game is a great game and I love that the devs are active and listening to feedback. They have patched it every day so far to make it great. It now has a quick tutorial for new players so that is a great thumbs up.I love the idea you can upgrade your drivers skills as well as the pit stop crew. You also are able to upgrade the car to make it perform better than the stock vehicle you start off with.Another thumbs up for this game, is that it doesn't matter what position you come in. As long as you finish the race you are guaranteed cash and skill points. After the race you also get badges. Badges come in the form of 'Top Speed', 'Longest drift' etc. So no matter whether your playing with those with upgraded cars or not, you are still able to get at least 1 badge. Each badge is worth a set number of skill points, so worth getting.Cons to this game is that it is in early access so there is lag and server time outs. However what features are in the game and the fact you have so much fun playing out weighs the lags you get. The community is great and we all have fun chatting whilst racing.So overall I would say, BUY IT. You cant go wrong and I believe you will absolutely get addicted to it like I have.If you don't buy it now, then you are missing out on a great game with devs that play the game as well and listen and patch the game daily.My name ingame should you buy it is TRAPFIRE. So if you read the review by all means let me know in game :)			"

								After 120 hours playing this game (2nd most in my library, behind FSX)   I thought I would write a follow up review.  The developers hqave did an awesome job on the game.  They fixed a lot of the bugs.  There is still a lot of potential in the game.  The last update was at the end of August. It is now almost the middle of November.   Hoping they add more soptions to the game.  That is the part that it lacks, the variety of options to do in the game.  Also there is almost a 2 minute wait time to start a race, wish they would knock that down to like 30 seconds.   There are a few things in the game that say ""coming soon""   so hopefully the developers are working on things :) My overall opinion as of 120 hours later.   If you like racing and a semi-manageristic game, you will like this.  Like I said, there is not many options to choose from in the game to do. So don't give high hopes.  I WOULD recommend the game.   I have invested 120 hours into it.  So you know I like it  :)      And going to spend many more hours in game.   I look forward to the developers adding things in the future.  They do listen to the fans, which is something you don't get from developers much these days.  So that is an added bonus! I would recommed the game.  Especially if it goes on sale! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I been playing it for a bit now and I can definitely see alot of potential.  I was hesitant on spending $20 for the game, but decided to buy it to give it a spin.  As you know right now it is still in the developing stages and is being updated often. Which is a good thing.  It is pretty nice to be the pit crew chief and tell the driver what to do. You have various views. My favorite view is inside the car. There is a lot more players now, so theres more competition. Theres a few things I wish they would add in the future: Single player modeMore laps, so you have more than 1 pit stop Overall, they have been working on the bugs and glitches and been doing a great job at it. And I plan on playing this for a very long time.			"

								"" Edit: 2 days of gameplay, and I have noticed that the games crashes and lags....ALOT.  When i first got it there were only a few players. If i had not spent my first 10 hours playing against only 2 to 3 players with bots, it might have been a thumbs down from the lag and lag cuased crashes. This has to go under the cons and really comes close to changing my thumbs up on this one, but i can see the Devs pushing out updates fast.  We will see if it gets fixed. That 90% of races comment below, should be changed to 50% now. ""Ok so despite the lack of content, this game is suprisingly addictive.  As stated, its EA, with a few bugs and lag issues. but I would say that the 90% of races that I have had no issues like that with have been alot of fun.  Its a ""just one more race"" type game and before you know it, the suns coming up.The Bad. Not enough cars/parts. Fixable with time.Confusing till you learn what each button in a race really does.  Fixable with tutorial that i could not find if there is one.No was to group with others to race, all matches random.  Fixable with time.Graphics a bit late 2000, but still very acceptable for what it is.  Dont see a need to fix.Good.Potential for a great management game.ChallengingIts not a sit back and watch management, your instructions to the driver matter.Time-vampireAll in all, As long as it grows, both in the content and community, that game WILL be better than it already is.

												I purposely avoid buying early access games.  Picked this up thinking it was a finished game but unfortunately it is basically still early access with lots of features that won't be complete for months.  Player base much too small and coding does not allow for more then 6 players to play a race at once.The game has lots of great features and could be great but due to developers rushing the game out and destroying the player base I'm very dissapointed.  Would not buy a game from this studio again.			"

Yes it has its flaws, it lacks content and is anywhere far from any goal, but the most important thing in this game is given: It makes fun. It has a cool concept and is not in any way too complicated. You go out there prepare your car, paint it, upgrade it and look after your team a little.

												A game that had the potential, but just falls flat.It contains elements of what I wanted from a racing management simulator: sponsorship deals, six cars to choose from, a few good tracks, upgrades, stat point upgrades, leaderboards… That being said it's lacking in core features and polish. This lack of polish gives the game that Free 2 Play grind feeling with the price tag. Want to be competitive on the oval track? Better save up for that car that's good on ovals and then hope you have that car equipped when the game randomly selects the track for you. Granted, smart strategy can get you past these pitfalls, but it's still a major grind and you're fighting the RNG to get the track you want to race at.Most game modes are locked with a promise of a later release date. The game has its share of bugs (DNFs causing money loss in cups in following races, wrong tires being put on cars, bots getting stuck on walls and winning awards because of it, driver commands not working at times). Also, the netcode cannot handle large fields with 200ms latencies across players. In my opinion this game was released from early access way too soon.With the small player base, you're relegated to racing against bots 98% of the time. In the times we did get a league race together with 8-12 other players (the max field size is 16), the game would become unplayable. Laps wouldn't be counted, pit crew animations would completely vanish, and the lag was unbearable.I had dedicated 70+ hours to this game, helped build a subreddit, and tried to be an active member in the community.  Arctic Hazard Game Studio was very responsive and even quickly provided a patch to allow us all to race together as a group. While I commend them for that, it hasn't entirely redeemed a game that has such critical flaws. It does show they do care about Trackday Manager, but it got rushed to market before it was ready for showtime.It’s a shame, because I really wanted to like this game. There's not a lot of options in this genre and there really should be. It's something that if done well, could be a big hit.I recommend not buying this title, not even on a sale price in it's current state. If/when the developers do release a trial/F2P version of the game and you are interested, try that out first. If upcoming patches makes major changes to the game, I will be more than happy to re-review this.			"

												I bought this game thinking it would be the GTR equivalent of a football managing title. I was surprised to find that, although related to the managing genre in the various tasks you attend to when not actually racing, this is actually a deeply rewarding real-time pvp strategy game. This is how it works. Up to 16 players compete in races where you control the various strategic and tactical tasks that go towards running a racing team. Pitstop and tyre strategy is, of course, key to your success and winning a race on the last lap because of your fresh tyres is a thing of pure joy. But there's more still - you actually control a lot of your drivers actions. Engine mapping, KERs deployment, deliberately tail-gating to save fuel, whether you want your driver to attempt an overtake (and which side to try it on) or whether to drive defensively - all these things you control in real-time.However the real gem here is the multiplayer element. I've owned this less than a day and already I have had some amazing duels with budding team managers from all over the world. The community is fresh and happy with the game right now, which is always nice to be a part of.Don't get me wrong, this is clearly a rather niche title as well as an independent one (so not without it's annoying quirks or balancing issues) but for someone who spends every Sunday glued to the telly screaming at Ron Dennis that I could do his job so much better this is absolutely perfect and I love it.

								Always a big fan of managing games and most of all, Racing Manager games. Great fun, just wished there were more people playing the game for more competition/people making race mistakes. Future developments posted great up coming features that will improve the game tremendously. Totally recommend this game. Would be great to have a 4 pack deal to share it with friends.			"

								The game is unique, and fun to play when it works. Online stability is pretty iffy, and there isn't a whole lot of content just yet. I’d be interested to follow up with the game over time to see how it’s shaping up, as the devs have been dropping patches frequently. If they can manage to eliminate most of the server issues and add a bit of content, this game has the potential to become genuinely special. It’s worth mentioning that the game is being developed by a small studio of six people, and it already looks fantastic. The in-race lighting effects, especially during nighttime runs, are impressive, especially among its Early Access peers. Taking into consideration that cooperative racing teams are in the works as well, allowing for you and your friends to take on races together in your sponsor-covered customized cars, Trackday Manager might be one of the most compelling racing experiences to grace PC gaming in a long while. Easy to learn, but bloody difficult to master, this is definitely one to watch.If you'd like a more in-depth first-impressions article, come look at my shameless plug! http://www.firesidefrag.com/going-the-distance-trackday-manager/(A review copy of the game was provided for the article)			"

								This game ticks many boxes for me.  It's like a collaboration of a few games I've played over the years.I began my interest inside arcades around the late 70s/early 80s.  There was a mechanical racing game -- in which you put in 2pence or 10pence (memory!), and the mechanical cars zoomed around a scaletrix-like track -- the cars were colour coded -- and if the car you bet upon was on the finish line -- you won some moolah!  Well, it wasn't moolah -- but it felt like it at the time!  I loved it.Flash-forward, and this game also reminds me of super sprint.  Another arcade release, which this time got ported over to various computers of the day.  I was a spectrum guy, but I liked my friends C64 version better.Flash-forward quite a few years later -- this game also reminds me WRC Powerslide.  I played this on XBOX360,  of which I've been a gamer, or rather, a racer for quite some time.   I really enjoy rally, and this different perspective was fab.Onward we go, and deciding upon an XBox One or PC Gaming has been a tough choice.  I went for change.  Trackday Manager is my first game on steam -- and I'm super-impressed.  Although, it must be said -- it was probably an easy sell given my history.The game is under early-access, but I don't have any perspective of this -- so I'm just giving the game a battering and not trying to be overly critical of any bugs and such.  On the flip-side to Steam in-maturity stands a laid-back, it will get done when its done kind of guy.  But let's work towards getting it done in an efficient manner.I'm sure there's things cropping up which the developers didn't think about, didn't consider, didn't think were possible -- but then -- this is why they are developers -- development takes time.The game can be simple.  The game can be intricate.  Track position can be king.  Strategy can rule.  The possiibilities are endless.My name is razzitGT.I'll see you on the track.			"

												This is my first review on steam - the game has moved me to add comment.The game has a simple and addictive premise - win races, improve car, gain sponsors, win races, repeat. The online factor, again something i am new too, just adds to the competition and the community. I bought the game 5 days ago and can't stop playing. Think i've got into 20 hours or so already. I even find myself checking the discussion boards out when i'm at work on my mobile.There is no instant gratification - it's not easy - you have to figure things out........ but it's definitely worth it - and the feeling when you get your first win is uber satisfaction!I hope you enjoy as much as i am enjoying it - see you on the track!

Even for a Alpha title i would strongly recommend it, even for players not liking driving games or cars general, but love manager stuff. I will review it again later when its out of Alpha and then see if its a thumb up or down ! but as of now i only have to congratulate the team on a positive review.http://steamcharts.com/app/348030 here are the playerbase of the game!

												I was a magazine editor/games reviewer for some 20 years. Trackday Manager is the kind of game that we would actually look forward to getting in to review. It is also the kind of game that would put the team in serious danger of missing that month's deadline. Simple (with hidden depth), highly addictive and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm baffled by the negative reviews as this has 'hidden gem' written all over it.			"

												I have done a review on this game before. However upon the new update and seeing the game slightly differently, I want to change my thoughts on the game slightly.I still maintain that this is a good game. What isn't so good is the way it's being handled (much like Wreckfest from what I've read). The game has been on a slightly less than steady decline for awhile now. Some of this has to do with the fact that finding players in the lobby is difficult, the wait time to find a lobby in the first place is annoying and that the amount of updates for the game have been really (really, really, really) slow. Of course there are times when games have less updates than what the community would ideally want.However TrackDay manager has passed crossed that line by a big margin now. If you want this game then I recommend you understand these three things in order to enjoy it.Finding other players that aren't AI is going to be hard: I don't know if there is some sort of Steam group right now that has players that will play this game on a semi-regular basis, but if there isn't then that made it that little bit harder to find players to race with.Finding lobbies to race on takes awhile, have patience: It takes about 110 seconds for the game to find a lobby, I know it's ridiculous but just make a snack or something in the meantime. Maybe watch a TV for a few seconds.There are other people that have been playing since the game's releasing, so they may have better cars than you: Try not to get too frustated if you can't beat other players, they probably have better cars anyway. Just try your best and take anything above last as a win.This is by far from being a terrible game. It's not even that far from being a great game. What holds it back is the lack of updates the game has been getting. I do recommend this game but only if you understand what I've listed above. This game isn't hard to enjoy but it can be difficult to not get very annoyed at it.In short: It's a good (and quite enjoyable) game. However it needs to be handled better than it currently is.			"

								Would definitely say this game has potential and is a new take on the Real Time Strategy genre of gaming. It's not fully management as you can see your race unfold for the good or the bad and YOU have the control to make or break a race. It's definitely not for someone who can't think things through, this really does test your perception and strategic techniques. Arctic Hazard have caught onto something which really appeals to the car enthusiast, or even anyone with an interest of racing in GT3-like cars. Creation is currently limited but I am sure there will be some extra ways to customise your car in the future.One complaint are the servers and the fact that a basic computer can barely run the game. It's a great game for sure and the game is well optimised but once the servers improve and it registers information, it truly is going to be one of the great indie titles on the market to be verified through Steam Greenlight.EDIT: Since writing this review, the game has come a long way. The servers have improved drastically and are working fantasticly. This game hasn't been out long and the developers have listened to their fans and fixed what needed fixing. However, as I said in my earlier review, you need an above average PC to run it. A simple run-of-the-mill i5 laptop (Which is what I'm using) just won't cut the processing needs for this game without a hitch. This is the bare minimum you'd need to even think about playing the game. It is a fantastic game and with more game content due out soon, you can expect great things from Trackday Manager and a bright future for Arctic Hazard.			"

												A very cool concept, something totally lacking in the market.  An Indie game well executed, and if there arent enough real world players, bots come into play.  I've never had to wait long for a race.  I'll give this a vote up because I think there is a lot of fun to be had here, and I hope more people jump on board and stop wasting their money on Roller Coaster Tycoon three, but I would like to see more content and a bit more depth in the future.

								I fkin love this game! I´ve been waiting for something like this!A few things I would like to see in the future: -Different car setups I can change be4 the race, depending on the track I hate setting up the car for eco mode and then have to do a high speed map-More cars!-More customization options for the team/team logo- Different viewmodels (maybe thats already ingame but I just dont know how to change it) like a actioncam or a tv-cam. Update: Turns out there are more view modes (1st person mode) but a tv-mode would still be awesome!-Different leagues- A commentator for the races would be THE AWESOMEST thing ever! I know this one is hard to do but if you can get it to say the team names and stuff like that, that would be awesome! If the commentator also has a co-commentator and theire funny as hell, even better!Still, I think this can become a great game and already is a lot of fun! 7/10 will update once game nears completion.

												So downloaded the demo and it wouldn't start for a few hours on the first day. Great start then.Came back to it about 3~5 days later and demo started so gave it a go. Demo was alright so bought the game.Generally gameplay is pretty good, but you really have to grind on this one, which I don't really mind. Graphics aren't worth a millions bucks, no damage sim at all, so mega crashes can happen and no damage appears.Have not had a single game with other humans, so I can't say what the servers are like, however I often lag so its trying to reach a server.AI is alright, but very predictable. When race is going from wet to dry the AI pits way to early.Overall game is not too bad. If you enjoy motorsport then give it a go, however if you aren't a motorsport person maybe try the demo before buying. Demo is basically whole game at the moment as most stuff has ""Coming Soon"" (tm Blizzard) all over it, so apart from the cap on races per day the demo is pretty much the main game.Overall, a 3/5. Probably more of a 50/50 then a recomend, but it's beter than 50% so its a ""recommend"" nevertheless.			"

								Ever play the android gem called ""Grand Prix Story?"" This is the next gen version of that. Massive potential, and remarkably simple yet addictive gameplay.Think Gran turismo spec B mode, but more entertaining.Like I said, tons of potential, and theyre genuinely working hard to improve the game. Already worth 20 bucks.That said, there is a lot more content that needs to come. Maybe model the ""Grand Prix Story"" a little bit and have the occasional ""grand prix"" option that comes up,  more cars, maybe a RALLY mode. All of these things would work great under this engine.			"

								I've always liked racing manager games (provided they're any good) and this is no exception. I like managing the team, upgrading the car and the race, even though I still don't  understand whether the choices I make in race actually make a difference. I would like to be able to choose the driving style of my pilot (aggressive, stay back, conserve the tires etc.). At this stage the biggest problems are of performance of the software itself. I've watched races in which I placed really well and then the system froze, losing all my hard work. The last race ended with a server error when I had finished 4th. Bugs need to be squashed and performance needs to be worked on and improved.All in all it's a good game that I would recommend to my race loving friends. Let's hope it gets even better! "

												I thought it was time to update my EA review which was positive but also had a lot of fixes and recommendations. A year or so on, I feel I am at the same stage where the game has now been released and it's as enjoyable as ever but you get the feeling it left EA a month or two earlier than it should have.Overall the game is a great game and has that one more go appeal. I won't go into the specifics of what the game is about as there are many other reviews covering that aspect. I guess some of my thoughts may have been covered on the forum already, but I haven't read through each comment, so bear with me if I have said the obvious which has been covered.Pros:- I can't think of any other game like this on Steam- Great racing and your strategy can really make a difference.- Nice weather affects which really do change a game mid race.- Graphics are ideal for this type of game- Developers all be it small are in constant comms with the players and seem a dedicated bunch who have a proper passion for the game- The AI could be better but not bad either.- Able to play when there are not enough people online- Good community so far, bar the odd disconnector which I gather has now been patched- If you're a stoner, it's an ideal sit back and veg type game, with tiny mouse inputs throughout :)- Other race modes look great, but no dates on when they will be readyCons- Matchmaking leaves a lot to be desired. New players are already faced with meeting the 'new' cars and the issue becomes worse if you meet someone with a flying time as the AI will then also follow the fastest persons time, thus making it nigh on impossible to get anywhere.I understand the concern of matchmaking would make less people per race at this present time, but racing against bots your own level would help their progression for new players.- Lag, but I'm not sure if it's just me but it seems to be getting better?- Certain tracks suit certain cars. Not being able to make at least a change or two at the lobby stage to suit the track does hinder your chances.- Oval track (Sorry I hate this track)- Other car modes and cup features not being ready on launch.- Some bugs from EA are still here a year on.Recommendations- I know there are 2 sides to this one, but reverse grids in Quick Race as well as Cup to try to balance the game out. otherwise we're going to keep losing new players to refund which I have discussed on a previous post.- You should have the option when being slipstreamed to shake the car off rather than just have him tail you to save fuel and there is nothing you can do bar pit.- Reverse tracks to vary the races- More tracks and to balance out the tracks for speed and also handling of the cars- Make race distances varied with Sprint, normal and enduro distances. - Sort out the matchmaking- Try to introduce another compound for a tyre, medium? This will again add more strategy to the game. For me the game is more enjoyable from a strategic point of view than the actual racing.- Giving the player the option to make 1 or 2 changes max when you find out what track your on in the lobby would help things as there is nothing worse than having a handling set up to then find out you are on the oval. Obviously works the same way vica versa.- It needs more upgradeable parts to vary things. Overall I still stand by and give the game a positive review. I've been here since day one and have seen it when we had no servers for days and bugs that made the game totally unplayable.What we have now isn't perfect by any means and there is a long way to go, but give the devs a chance as this game could be a great game if we keep the number of players up and it ever improves.Anyway, that's my tuppence.

												Spent about an hour with it here's what I got:Pros:1) cars look good (but theres only 6)2) for the few tracks I tried, they seemed interesting and challenging3) I did enjoy trying to strategise how I was going to get past cars, and it felt satisfying when you passed someone4) wait times were around 1:30, 2:00 min max. That might seem high to some, but it's not bad for a new game. The maximum is that you will be pitted against bots; so your not stuck if no one is available.Cons:1) Not a fan of the sound track2) Hoped for more detailed car modding rather than ""packages"" 3) 2/4 races failed for one reason or another. In one my car got stuck trying to pit and just didn't move. In another the race never started. Had to quit to menu. 4) In another race I did not finish because I ran out of fuel... Now I may be wrong here, but why couldn't I just take a time penalty to get more fuel? Seems silly.5) Watching the cars felt a bit like watching RC cars race... Steering felt a little rigid.6) There's a NOS-like feature that fills up after every lap. That's a little 'gamey' if you ask me. (EDIT: I've been corrected that this is a real thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy_recovery_system)7) You collect experience to spend on your team, but I never found a way to do that.8) You can lobby sponsers for contracts, which is neat, but it feels a bit arbitrary to build a high enough chance to get them to sign. I realize this was a simple way to simulate going out and getting contracts, but it's not terribly immersive and feels more like a mini game that is artificially handicapped by the 'TU' (time units). So its sorta like the TU are quarters and the contract 'game' is a bit of a slot machine you handicap in your favor over time.9) No camera controls. The follow cam stays on one side of the car, making it difficult to see where the car is going. You could zoom out, but that works dyanmicly so the camera is constantly panning in and out. That's not a huge issue... the main issue, is not knowing when a turn is coming to strategise your abilities (which side to overtake, when you might want to use your boost or overcharge..)10) I could be wrong, but it felt like you were racing against whomever was available regardless of skill level. That's fine, but it should be spelled out clearly that you might be up against someone with a tricked out car and a number of wins or fresh n00b. It's a little unfair to not know your competition. I expect that will get ironed out in the future, but again, its out of EA so who knows?I could go on, as I noted far more bugs and oddities than I listed, but I'm trying to be fair. All in all though, this game though I got it on sale wants me to believe its retail price is close to $30CAD. So I will compare it other games I've gotten at that pricepoint - and it really, really is not there. Mainly I was looking for a more serious racing manager... But as one reviewer said, whos warning I really should have heeded more strongly.. This is a game that would work better as an iOS app than a desktop racing manager. One thing is clear from looking at the game, it's clearly a work in progress. A number of modes for example are ""coming soon"", and there's also only 6 (albeit highly detailed) cars that are clearly modeled on real life cars. So one expects that in the future one will see more tracks, more cars and probably more features. This makes me think that someone of the game mechanics may simply be placeholders for future, better versions. In the end though, this isn't EA anymore. What you see, is what you get right now and for a game where the retail price is close to $30. or multiplayer only plus the severe bugs (pathing errors and non-starts are like getting uncooked food at a resturant. Unacceptable in 2016 at this pricepoint). That's too rich for me.I've requested a refund.tl;dr;Not a serious racing manager. Lacks content. Heavy on the bugs. Clearly a work-in-progress still. Priced too high, when it's current version would compete better with App Store games than other titles.			"

												so after 17 hours of this game I decided I would edit my original review which was done after only a couple of hours.I stated in that review the game should still be classed as early access, and nothings changed the game is far from finished and the early access label would at least inform buyers that the product they are purchasing has issues!!Out of the several game options available only one is available to actually play and that is........Quick Race.Nothing quick about it mind, I've waited upto 5 minutes after clicking that button.Races are pretty much won doing the same stratergy every time, 1 stop! It only gets mixed up if it rains.The AI are useless, they'll push you into the pits making your car stick to a wall until the game realises you're stuck and then places you back on track at a standing start losing several positions with ease and all out of your control.At starts your car if it gets a good start it will drive straight into the back of the car in front, meaning it comes to a stop and then has to get going again dropping you to the back of the grid.AI like to try and both be in the same place rubbing against each other and slowing each other down. No race craft involved of staying by side without touching.Again the AI will randomly stop at points in track forcing you to hit them, stopping your car dead destroying your race. (if these are planned ""accidents"" they need to be animated better as the AI literally looks like it hit a brick wall and then started going again once you hit them) The game crashes if someone leaves the race.Most of the grids are filled with AI as human players seem to be a rare thingI can list more and more issues, but overall I'm done with the game.Wish I'd gotten a refund straight away but I thought I'd give it chance, maybe I'll return to it in the future but right now I wouldn't recommend this game.Better off buying Motorsport Manager on your iPhone or Android as that game may not look as nice but it has more depth to it!

								This is very early and has rather alot of weird lag issues and cars all over the place as the green flag drops but it's early access so hopefully it'll get worked out.That said, it's a fascinating concept that works well and is very enjoyable when it all works smoothly.  I recommend waiting untill nearer release before dropping the cash on it mind you.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a wicked little game. Even tho its early access its still lots of fun to play. You can be on the edge of your seat some races trying to pass, block, boost to get that win while watching your fuel and hoping your tires can make it to the line. Other times you just sit back and let the your driver have an easy life and leave him to race it himself. You don't have to steer your car, just give driver orders in the race which I seem to be enjoying. Plenty upgrades for you cars, colour schemes, and when you get sponsors you can really jazz it up. Friendly community in races.Yes there is bugs that they work on every day to keep it running, at least races are only 10 mins or so its not that much of a loss if game bugs on you.Lots of potential. Good luck, see you on the track.Hothnogg "

												Pretty cool concept.  I love car race sims, and being able to customize the car.  I would wish for more ""Free"" customization of stripes, numbers, logos, and letters.  The races are sometimes a bit too long.  Most of the cars racing are bots, but good to see real drivers too.EDIT:  Changed my recommendation due some issues, and lack of features.   Some race modes are currently locked even though this is a released game.  Another issue is waiting too long to connect to a race... sometimes 2-3 minutes seems forever staring at the car in the garage.  This needs to be fixed.  ASAP.Actually this morning I waited 8 minutes and just gave up.  That was the last straw.  I will probably only check game a few times to see if things are fixed.   I cannot just stare at a screen more than 5 minutes without the game launching.... it's marketed as a race game NOT a screen saver.			"

												I can easily understand why the reviews are mixed about Trackday Manager. So let's get to the Pros and Cons.ProsHas a bit of a learning curve making it challenging even against ai.Graphics are decent. Variety of upgrades and customization.Sponsorships and skill upgrades not bad.Enough tracks and cars to not make it boring.ConsGame freezing from time to time is my biggest complaint. Has happened to me right before start to 2 laps to go. Very disappointing for a game that is out of Beta and ""live""For a game that is not FPS intensive it sure does have lag issues from time to time making it incredibly annoying when it happens. Needs to be some explanation of usage of controls/commands to the driver. All in All this game is not bad but needs some TLC on the above issues. 6/10 Stars.Edit: 5/22/16: HAving played the game now for many hrs it is fun and challenging. Arctic Hazard has made some very good updates to clean up some of the issues with lag among other things. The lack of a large community is the only complaint I now have, the game is worth the money.			"

												Ever since the first time I played B-Spec in Gran Turismo from PS3 it started an obsession with games where I don't control the car directly but just manage.  There is some fun but inferior similar products on mobile gaming but this is the most fun I have had with the concept on PC gaming by far.  The start can be abit slow but every startup race team probably finds life difficult at first trying to get anywhere you just need to start getting those low level finishes to snowball into sponsorships and upgrades.

												Early Access is over, and Mr. ""1000+ hours of playing TDM"" has a word for YOU!First of all, I love racing games. Since Ridge Racer for PS1 I am addicted to good racing games. I played season and season in F1'97. Gran Turismo 1+2, of course. Weeks of playing Ferrari F355 Challenge online on SEGA Dreamcast. F1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 from Codemasters. Project CARS, iRacing and many many more. I would say, over 10000 hours all together. More practise in virtual racing than every 'real' driver on track. So what do I think about TDM? I've bought it in early access phase, 29th May 2015. Played a lot and helped sorting out the bugs. Giving some ideas (like the qualifying in cup mode). It was very nice. Eating in front of the PC was a regular meal.Then there was release day. Everyone was online. Matches filled with up to 12 players. Most of the time lag-free. Very great races.How does it feel in comparison to project CARS, for example?Both are competitive racing games. In TDM you don't need a steering wheel, don't have to learn the basics about racing or 30+ tracks. You just buy your first car and go on track. Very few buttons to play the game. But very addictive gameplay, if you match up with competitive players.After the release, they changed something and you don't match up to a lot of players, even when a lot of players are in-game. But we communicate over steam and invite each other for cup races. And if you want to farm money for a new car, just go for bot races. You will need $14.000.000 to get all cars with all upgrades. Long-term-fun? Yes. I did it (buy all 6 cars) for three times now (2x early access and after release).Is this game for racers? Yes, and like every racing game, it is JUST for racers. Managers will go away very quickly. What is the graphics like? It suits the game. And the price. Go on YouTube and check some videos.Tell me about the bugs!We had a lot of detected bugs in ea and I have to say, the worst bugs are gone. And you can work around the most existing bugs. Which expands the gameplay (where to overtake at pit entry, sponsors patching and so on).How much is it worth? That's your own decision. I've read bad reviews with 2,5 hours of total play time. I've played 1000+ hours now. And at the actual state it is worth €20-25 to me.Maybe you should see this game as a slot racer. With 6 available tracks and 16 cars in race. Overtaking isn't easy and you have to stay calm even when a bot blocks you for half a lap - and then pits!Sponsors aren't fun, but you have to make more money!And please forget about the management part. It is just, but a very different racing game.			"

								I really like the game. It's fun, a little light for management, but whatever, it's much better graphics than many management games. The dash cam is great.BUT....there are so many bugs and crashes, honestly, it's more like an alpha. I'm not used to even early access games crashing SOOOOOO much. For assets, the game is great, for stability, send it back to alpha and forget EA until it works, pls.UPDATE: After over 60 hours, I am seriously considering giving up (and potentially asking for a refund)...the game is just so buggy. This is really a case of buyer beware, the game itself is very, very fun, the problem is it's also very, very unstable. This makes for a frustrating experience.			"

												It needed another six months or more in Early Access. It just isn't ready for primetime yet.  I think only one mode is currently available, because Cup mode is broken and disabled. A couple of other modes are listed as ""coming soon"", which is another reason it should have stayed Early Access for a while longer. Check back in a few months to see if they've gotten it working properly, or wait for a sale.The concept is good, but it can often be a bit boring sitting back watching your driver do his thing against an entire field of bots, because there aren't enough human opponents.  It was a good feeling to win my first race, which didn't take too long to acheive.  However it feels like it's going to take forever to be able to afford the next step up in cars. You don't make very much money even for a first place finish.  It's not a bad game, it's just not a finished game.   Feels like an Alpha or Beta, not final release.			"

								This is a novel twist on car racing simulators, you are effectively the team manager, but also on the radio to your 'driver' during the race, and decisions you make WILL affect the outcome of the race.......PROBLEM !!!!  -  It's just not ready for people to play properly. Every other race is either too laggy to race, or the cars don't appear, or the race stats don't update the database at the end of a race, or the, or the,,,,yadda yaddaThis needs to be taken back offline and the major issues resolved before bringing it back.I love the idea, but I'm getting so fed up of races not finishing, servers being taken down every half hour, etc. that I may turn away for good.Which would be a shame			"

								I've played a few hours of this game and to be fair enjoyed a small portion of it.Yes the developers are working and trying to patch the issues but as it stands there are far too many issues that makes this early access game unplayable. The main issue is the lag, it's like playing on dial up. The lag spikes are unreal watching your and the other vehicles bounce back and forwards and sometimes they even spin and end up taking off.So as of now I'll be avoiding this game further until there's some promising future patch note reviews. However keep an eye out as the devs are active and patching as much as they can.			"

												I've followed the EA progress of this game for several months, because it's a really cool concept. Finally on release i started playing and have to say, that i really do love that game! The tension in the races varies for sure, but all those close races do push up your adrenaline and overtaking the leader of the race shortly before the finish line due to better tires in the end is an awesome feeling!There are definetly some issues at the moment that need to be fixed, but i am sure the devs are working hard on it. Their feedback and experience from EA prove this. The races currently get stucked sometimes, but it has become less already. And you have to consider that some issues regarding lags or networking instability is always an issue for online games at the beginning. Even Blizzard had to struggle with it. Of course in a larger scale, but also with much more resources on their side. Just a few more days and some fixes and adaptions by the devs and races will work smoothely. Eventhough the game restarts are currently necessary, it is still lots of fun, because the general concept of giving your driver some high level instructions is fun and is not getting boring during races. You always have to consider so many different things. Can i push further or do i have to save some fuel or tires? Should i stay out one more lap and therefore choose soft instead of hard tires? Will there be some rain?One last thing to mention is the player base is currently already ok. During the main hours you get 5 or more real players into the races. More players would be cool for sure, but it is already really fun with a few real players to beat them.			"

												Let me preface this review by reinterating this is an Live Launch Review. Having observed the game's development and at times being it's harshest critic. I am finally amending my review to reflect some of the progress and improvement that is TrackDay Manager today. There are still some glaring issues to be worked out, but the game is about 85% there after final release. Which is to say, I'm about 85% towards giving this title the thumbs up. I advise deciding yourself about this title. That said, here are some of the Pros and Cons of TrackDay Manager.Update Per Live Launch: 5 May 2016Pros:1: Overall concept and premise of the game is great.2: Graphics are solid and suit the concept and focus of the game.3: Customization of race cars (Not 100% of this content is ingame), both paintschemes and sponsor placement.4: Online Multiplay, with AI fillers when lacking enough human players.5: In race chat, allowing folks to chat pre-during-post race.6: Straight forward Upgrade and Skill system, easy to understand.7: Tons of Achievements that actually unlock useful and cool ingame content.8: Highly interactive and communicative development team of 4. So yea it's small but very dedicated team.Cons:1: Laggy netcode( Peer to Peer), resulting in lag spikes and sometimes adversely affecting race mechanics. Let me make clear, there are folks from all over the world playing this title and unfortunately the sheer distance between say North American players and European players often results in  laggy races. As of now, you are lucky to see another human player 1 out of maybe 10 races. Sadly MP is pretty much broken. 2: Lack of Career mode, MP Racing Leagues, League Management Tools, etc. There is a Leaderboard, which tracks National, Regional and Global Ranking. The lack of League Management tools really misses the mark in allowing folks to set up (In a convienent fashion) their own racing leagues. There is a ""Cup"" format newly added, which is a 3 random tracks mini-race series, queued up for just like single quick race. ***Edit*** Custom races have been added, which will allow leagues to form and manage themselves externally. Though there are plans for alternate mode and Reward Cup Series coming to the game in trhe future.3: Limited amount of vehicles (6) and tracks (6), albeit there is more content incoming, no ETA.4: Microtransactions where mentioned at point, seems this may be a dead issue and no longer in this game's future. We hope.5: Rudimentary Matchmaking. New(er) Drivers are not matched with Drivers whom have Max Skills and Maxxed out Cars for 50 races. After that, time to dine the freshbloods.6: Absence of an Open Game Lobby, where folks can hangout chat, swap strategies, ask advice, arrange races.7: Inability to preset custom setups for each track, like real race teams would in real life. One setup and random assigned race tracks, so you end up using the same setup for road courses and ovals alike, etc.8: The New GUI has some work to be done, as it does error and give improper information.9: This game should have been developed as a iOS/Android Application.10: Since launch the Developement team has been slow to patch and often breaking more than fixing. Which was a problem during Early Access also. Communication has also all but dried up, the Devs seem to be paying less attention this newly launched title.11: Arctic Hazard Games did little to promote this title, barely a whisper on any social media and ignored Early Access Player advice to ultilize Twitch and other Social promotion venues.In the End, avoid this already dead title. Was a great idea, implemented poorly.			"

								I bought that game today and invested 7,7 hours. Other words, more the truth would be, i wasted 7,7 hours.While playing this game the game counts for my driver the do not finish percentage. After these nearly 8 hours my do not finish was more than 50% due to bugs. There are server issues, client issues and connection problems. Even beside the race itself there are bugs annoying me (sponsors appearing and disappearing).The matchmaking is useless at all, there are so few players which results in no balancing - you race with cars & drivers with upgrades and more experience whith results in no experience and money for you.Stop wasting money and time, this is the most expensive early access game ever bought and it is bugged as hell.

												I have no idea how they're presenting this game as a non-beta.  The game is completely unfinished and very buggy.  That being said, this is actually a really good racing manager game that fills a niche where no other game really has.  It will be worth the 25 bucks they're charging when it actually has full functionality.  As of now there are only 2 racemodes:  Single Race & Cup Race.  There are 4 other modes which haven't been fully developed and are therefore not released yet.  Single Race mode is really the only option right now as the Cup mode is being developed and is incredibly buggy. In approximately 1/6 of my races the game crashed, so that can be pretty annoying.  It only takes about 3 minutes max to jump into a game too, don't listen to this 10 minute stuff other people are posting.Right now this game is worth about 5 bucks, but that may change in the future.  Get this game if it really does look appealing to you, just be forwarned about the bugs.			"

However it does have great potential, it has great racing and lots of things for you to manage, pleanty of cars and tracks and customisation for your vehicle. the game is laggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥even on a decend system although im sure they will fix this. also progress is misrably slow and half the bad reviews are becasue there is no content - as i said early acsess needed or they need to get there♥♥♥♥♥in gear to please people.Over all its a Great game as it stands and i will recomend this game to people once the add some content!

												Game is pretty rad. If you like motorsport and the tactics involved then check it out.You basically just give basic orders to a driver, such as when to deploy KERS, what tyres to be on (weather changes), when to pit etc. It's reasonably detailed for what it is, races take about 10 mins and allow for strategy. The whole game is online, if there are no players you race against the AI.You then earn money from racing which you spend on upgrading parts, each which has pros and cons. You also can get sponsors and display them on the car to earn more money. Ontop of that there is XP which you distribute  between your driver, crew and staff.This game has alot of promise, it's pretty decent at the moment but if they add more modes, seasons, leagues etc. then it could be a classic game.

Early Access Review
-Recommended....hmmm.. ambivalent...Yes-Whilst Trackday is a great concept, at this stage of development I cannot recommend this game as one to buy now. It is very laggie (even with a 3Mbts per sec connection), the game play is really clicking a couple of buttons to increase speed and remembering to re-click before your engine overheats. I was doing really well in races until I upgraded my car, and now performance is worse than the starter car - so very quickly this game has become ""not fun"". There isn't much to do outside of racing, except upgrading your car, accepting contracts (one click wonders), and assigning experience points (which seem to do nothing). This game frequently crashes, and can lock up whilst you are at the starting grid, and once it unlocks, your car is halfway round the track having being passed by everyone during the time the game locked up. This happens frequently during round the track often too.There are only 3 cars to choose from at this stage, the models are nice, and you can either have a top down view of your car, or go first person and see the race from the passenger seat - which is nice also.The developer has stated that the races favour the player but the AI seems to be able to come from half a track down, to zoom past you (or knock you out of the race) which is just stupid.There are no penalties, so bad driving gets rewarded heavily and cars don't seem to suffer any damage even when they have been endoed by some rogue AI car. For frustration, I give this game a 10/10, otherwise:Early Access Score: 4.5/10Buy it, if you don't mind waiting for alot of fixes and additions to be made.			"

												Trackday Manager is a good tactical racing game, a blend of long term team building and moment-to-moment decision making.  While it lacks depth and is thin on content, it does provide a strong casual gameplay experience - great for anything from 15-20 minute play sessions or hours of obsessive racing.  In spite of its current flaws, I happily recommend it.			"

								IN ITS CURRENT STATEGame concept             7/10            Not Original, but many unique partsGraphics                     7/10            one of the best out there for a managerGame stability             2/10            Pretty awful, completly unplayable at timesMatchmaking              0/10             It doesnt exist, no really, theres a raking system, but the game doesnt compute it in any way shape or form when matching players.The game has a lot of potential, and if you want to support a decent go at a racing team manager game drop the 20$ by all means. As it stands right now, the server instability absolutely kills about half the races run. In a game where split second decisions cost you wins/top 5's having server latency issues as often as it does makes the game near unplayable at times.The races where the server doesn't lag, you are always matched against players with a lot more invested into thier team. EX:  I've had a top 25 world player in just about all of my first 14 races, which makes it nigh impossible for a win, or a top 5, just finishing above mid pack is pretty good. I'm not sure if this is due to not enough players to populate more races or just a completely non-implemented matchmaking system. If you don't mind losing, trying to figure out the game while racing vs fully invested teams, and you love to beat your face into the keyboard grinding 1.5k a race to maybe have a chance a month or so down the road, this games for you.There is a sick satisfaction when you actually finish a race though, kind of like...wow did anyone really just witness that whole race completing with minimal lag, and some actually decent racing?!The devs seem to care about the game and community and have been trying to fix the server issues, but until something drastic changes the game does not have a big enough draw to keep this gamer playing through the L...La.......Laggggg.

												I have edited this review on 5/10/16.  Before this edit I gave this game a huge thumbs up for the reasons below but I have to point my thumb down now until the game is at least tweaked if not fixed.  Please continue reading.  Here is a list of things that make me not want to play this anymore.1.  The AI is not competative, it's a prick.  It will push you sideways down an entire straight completely ruining any chance you or it has of winning.  On the otherside of the coin, YOU make the smallest contact and YOU will slam on the breaks letting half of the pack pass you by.2.  No matchmaking.  Not only does it throw you and your slightly upgraded starter car into a race with highend cars, but it rarely finds other players.  There can not be that small of a community.  It leaves you with an offline feeling without an offline mode.3.  Last but not least.  THIS SHOULD BE IN EARLY ACCESS!!!  I had great faith about these guys from the beginning but it seems like they might be stalling out.  No race car pun intended.  The last patch gave us cup mode (the 2nd game mode promised).  This is just like the single races just with 3 times the fruastration.7 out of 10 people found this helpful before my edit and I hope they're not trying to find me because I DO like this game.  Hell, I want to love it so much but until this is fixed I have to give a thumbs down.  The original review is below so you can read it covering the good.  This needs fixed.  It is, at its core, a good game.  We just need what was promised on release and hopefully an AI with a little more sense.I've been looking for this style of game.  You are not the driver.  You're the Crew Chief and Spotter for your Driver.  You give your Driver commands such as overtake either left or right, draft, block a car behind, or pit.  This is the stragety.  What tires for what weather or track.  How much gas to add.  All of your team can raise thier skills.  Your Driver can raise different skills to better his abilities as well as your entire Pit Crew and your Marketing.Pros-descent graphics.  Defenitly not top notch but ok on the eyes.-the interface is simple to use, easy to learn-additictive gameplay once you get the hang of it. (Top five finish and you just have to do one more race)ConsSOME OF THESE ARE DEAL BREAKERS...PAY ATTENTION!!-Doesn't feel complete...because it's not.  There is only one game mode available right now which is quick race.-lack of cars.  There is only six cars at the time of this review.-camera controls.  Maybe it's just me-lack of tracks.  I haven't seen many different tracks and I have a feeling as you progress to higher tiers they'll be the same tracks with faster cars.-Small Community.  I'm hoping it grows as the game is out longer, but for now a quick race wait time is about two and a half minutes.  Once the race starts it fills empty positions with bot cars.  I've actually raced a few with all bots.  Sad.Some reviewers are mentioning crashes but I haven't experienced anySo why did I give this a thumbs up when I see twice as many cons?  Because it's fun.  I bought it on sale and I have no regrets.  I only hope the Developers keep up the work and don't vanish like so many Indie Early Access Game Companies do.  Also, once the community grows the intensity will too.  It was pretty exciting trying to hold first with two players drafting behind you.  Followed by fourteen bots of course.  Come on!  Lets go racing!!			"

								I've only played for a few hours now and I feel the game has some great possibilities but my frustrations are growing with every lag, incorrect start and wasted race that doesn't load up the results to the server correctly.  The developers do seem very involved and concerned with fixing the problems mentioned.  If they do so then I would strongly recommend this game but at its current state, I can't endorse it.  I would simply say, buy at your own risk, knowing that there are some pretty serious with the game right now.			"

												So nach dem Early Access und den ersten paar Tagen nach dem Release, gebe ich gerne mal meine Meinung ab.Ich habe mir dieses Spiel gekauft weil ich bei Gran Turismo den B-Spec Modus so klasse gefunden habe.Dieses Spiel bringt mich diesem Modus ganz nahe.Natürlich gibt es Start Schwierigkeiten und es kann auch sein das der Release zu früh war.Aber endlich treffe ich wieder auf Menschen und nicht nur auf Bots.Die Entwickler unterhalten sich mit uns Spielern was ich sehr gut finde.Auf Bugs wird reagiert und notfalls auch der Server runtergefahren um ein neues Update aufzuspielen.Mal sehen was die Zukunft bringt.Aber wer ein Spiel sucht was den B-Spec Modus und ein Managerspiel vereint der sollte zugreifen.MFG Team Jamaica "

												After the latest Patch, they somehow screwed a lot of things up:- The behavor of the AI is plain rediculous! Claiming that the Bots are now more ""agressive"" and ""intelligent"", they now just crash you down the road and bump you from the side where the area of ""competitiveness"" is far behind.- The point-system is similar ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! 1 point for a PVP win at the time... but then you win a boring PVC race and get 4 points. And then you lose 5-10 (!!!!!) points for a 5th place... This is just sloppy work.- Rather than fixing such bugs & failures that were around since day one, they ""corrected"" some graphic issues or added some cars nobody was asking for.- This potentially game is really going in the wrong direction IMO.

								I have been enjoying this game, but lately I get stuck in the pitlane in every race and have to quit. The car tries to drive out of the pits and resets itself back in there over and over, even if the car is reset. I shall get back into it once I can finish races again. I like the way that the races are run and the cars battle with each other, despite the lack of a driver market, any sort of championship or many options for cars.			"

								I have never played a game like TrackDay Manager, so to me it definitely is unique. While still in Early Access, the final release seems... promising. While the game's graphics aren't amazing (maybe good for 2006 up to 8) the core game is pretty good. When I got the game I was given instructions on how to play (via private message from developers) and the game is pretty fun at times. I haven't played too much, and the lack of content isn't immediately spotted. The game is worked on by just 6 people, and if you compare this game to something like Big Rigs (with 12 developers) this game is like a masterpiece to that.So, if you would like to support the developers I'd say get the game in Early Access. However, if you want the most out of your buck, wait for the game to come out of E.A. So I would give it maybe a 7/10 or less.			"

												Despite some negative reviews on Steam, I tried this game out anyways and really enjoy it. It's more of a casual game as there really isn't that much to micromanage. There's a handful of cars that you can modify for improved performance, you need to negotiate contracts and display their logos on your car, the typical fare. You don't control cars directly, but issue commands to the driver that you can level up like an RPG. You decide when to pit, what tyres and how much fuel to keep in your car. I think the graphics are nice for a game that retails for under $12. There's various weather elements like rain, and night racing that adds a nice visual touch. Altogether it's easy to pick up and play, look nice, and I'd recommend it to someone looking for a casual management game.			"

It has a learning curve esp for those of us who aren't car geeks but things are pretty well explained. Community is very helpful. A little paticence and you won't regret having bought this game. A few races might get gliched but like I said the dev's are working on it and they are not a game breaker. Some visual errors but things work as intended just might go Great I won 49000 cash but in reality it might be 5000 cash. Visual error I can take that till it gets fixed.

Early Access Review
								This game is a gem! Or, at the very least, a diamond in the rough.After several hours of more fun than I had ever expected (man, those hours flew by fast) I decided it was about time I broke out of my shell and popped the review-cherry on Steam. And I'm not even a petrol head!The pros:- The races are fun!- Car customization is solid, with paint schemes, sponsor placement and may other details to tweak.- Weather and day/night cycle adds a lot of both tactics and atmosphere.- Skill system for driver and pit crew is simple and logical.- Online matchmaking system is good. I was a bit sceptical about this at first, but the solution to add in AI controlled vehicles to fill in the empty seats is very elegant as it completely eliminates queue times.The cons:- Would like to see the ""management"" part get expanded upon, for instance with more detailed control over the driver and pit crew (finding replacement team members, sending them to training camp, etc). This could also add some personal connection to the team, instead of just managing a car.- Skill system is a bit TOO simple. Some more advanced skill customization options wouldn't hurt. Although I guess that would probably be a result of more advanced management features (if we get individual skills for each team member for instance) so technically not a ""con"" on it's own, but deserves mention.- Not enough content. Should have more cars, more tracks, more everything. Leagues, tournaments, random events, counting the days in a season, calendar marking races and event you have signed the team on for, etc, etc.So, considering most of these Cons may be addressed before launch (this game is still in Early Access after all), I'd say this is looking mighty promising!All in all: Recommended!And a tip for those of you just getting started: Go to options and enable tooltips - that will help a LOT. And save you a lot of time trying to figure things out blindly, like I did. *cough*Seriously though, turn those tooltips on!			"

												Don't be confused by the non-recommendation, this is a fun game that itches a scratch I have for racing simulation and for what it has, it comes so close to being great.But the primary issue is that this game is far from complete; there are 6 ""possible"" race options but only one is available (quick race), there are only 6 cars and the grind is very real, and there are a few race-breaking bugs (being pulled into the pits by AI, lag resulting in undesirable results, once my car just flat out bypassed pits even though I made the order to stop). Admittedly the netcode seems to, for the most part, be able to account for lag and so rather than missing content, everyone experiencing lag instead experiences constant skipping. One race my game just stopped in-place due to lag: my connection was fine and the client still responded but the race refused to continue so I had to leave the race.That brings up another issue: there are very few players; the most populated race I played had 4 other players and the rest was AI.So while I've enjoyed my time in this game, I wouldn't recommend it until:1) Content is further added2) Glitches/bugs fixed3) Single player added4) Lag 5) Possibility of choosing whom you race and/or friends features6) Deceptively lacking content -- a ""released"" game with only 1 of 6 race options available is a jokeThese are the most glaring issues but there are certainly other areas that could be improved that other reviewers have touched on.

												Under the hood there's a great game here, we're just working through some launch day issues caused by server loads we couldn't hope to reach during EA.  Devs are working hard trying to iron out bugs and are very responsive.Game is a management-style game where you control a race team.  You can give orders to the driver such as pass on the left/right, floor it, and tail the guy in front of you, but you don't actually drive the car.  Money and XP to improve your car, driver, pit team, and manager (used for negotiating sponsorships==more money) from racing (EVEN IF YOU COME IN LAST PLACE!!!).FYI, game is also multiplayer only with races of 16 people, but if there are not enough people available it will fill the slots with pretty competent bots.  There's really no way to get griefed other than someone spamming the chat box; no direct player interactions and no VOIP.Pretty good as it is now, can only go up from here.			"

												Great idea but currently a broken game.Avoid this game until the devs fix it, there is some actual working content and races are stable.  If this were an early access game I'd be accepting but still disappointed.  As a release title this simply isn't good enough and Steam ought to suspend sales until it is actually works.I've held off posting my review to give the development team time to make the promissed updates.  Despite the latest patch this game remains broken, full of bugs and unplayable.  Features such as the 3 race cup series have been removed - apparently to create stability so there are currently only quick races available.  If other human races are in the room - the whole point of this multiplayer game - races now freeze at the start.The main problem is the instability of the game and frequent crashes at start or mid game.  There are many other bugs but even getting to race is a lottery, actually racing with other humans is highly unlikely to work.If you do manage to find a race and see it through to the finish there are a whole host of game breaking bugs which remain in the game:- Worn tyres fitted to the player car at the start of races.- Dry tyres fitted to the player car for wet races - after selecting wet tyres from the pre race menu.- Race finishing positions are incorrect.- Race payouts either do not add up correctly or do not work at all.- AI performance is erratic, the AI can often perform impossible feats.- Incorrect race statistics - my race statistics say I have completed over 90 races at a track I have really raced on less than 10 times.- Achievements unlocking randomly without any reference to what happens in the game.- Random sound issues, the sound seems to become a mixed up drone by mid race.Equally worrying is the fact the devs remove comments from the community hub.  The removal of my feedback on a recent test is one of the reasons I have decided to post this review today.  If the devs are now removing comments about the broken nature of the game this is unnaceptable.There is a great basic game idea here but at this moment this game is broken and not release ready at all.  I'll happily take a refund if the devs want to do the right thing!			"

CONS- It seems like this is supposed to be a multiplayer-only game. Personally, I'd prefer playing these games in single player where applicable.- It wasn't optimized well. Even on the moderate settings, you could barely stay above 30 fps.- Not a lot of content for a $25 game. There's about 6 cars and 6 tracks. Really? I've seen $10 games with more content!- If you're racing alone without human players, the AI will just bully you to oblivion-- it's super hard to beat them and get 3rd place.- Bad sound quality is bad.- A lot of wasted potential, pretty much. It's a very disappointing game.PROS- Pretty graphics, something not to expect in a Unity game.- The physics.- Soundtrack is cool, too.VERDICT5/10. Overall, this could be a great game, but I can't really recommend it. Not yet at least. I know they're still patching up some things and coming up with future content in the coming months, so maybe once the game updates and price drops, my review might change.			"

												I really like this game.  It has a lot of promise.  Currently their are a few lag/bug issues after release, but their have been numerous patches since release day, that make things better.  Finding a quick race still takes about 5 minutes, due to not too many people playing, but when you do get a race, man it is fun.  If you like SIM games, you'll like this.  If you like Racing games and SIM games, you'll spend hours in your garage making your best car.  I think the game will get better over the coming weeks with more patches and players.			"

								Despite the bugs, which are anoying I grant you, the game is very, very playable and I now have run up over twelve hours in game. If starting a race two or three times to get on that works would annoy you to distraction then hold off buying this game for a while. However, if you can take this in your stride, then give it a spin...Presently Artic Hazzard, the developer, is working hard to fix bugs and maintain a dialogue with the community.It's a lovely game with heaps of potential but the race system still has quite a few bugs to iron out. I am sure I will be recommending it as soon as the fix some of its teething troubles so stay tuned :)Update 12th June - Just logged on today and the game ran as smooth as silk. You should be able the play now without too much irritation - however, it is early access. Overall, a great game which is worthy of support.			"

								I'm a little disappointed. Trackday Manager is in a niche where I'm looking for a goodgame since a long time. A niche where I culd spend 50 € eyes closed for a really good game.But right now, the game is only on a very very early state. Had lots of crashes with my laptop (i5-4200U/ GT 840M/ 8GB) some very annoying bugs like cars teleporting (now fixed tough). The most annoying thing is that it seems that if you want to win, you don't have many options : you HAVE to play with your throttle pedal. Push it to the max when your engine is cool, when its about to burn, release it, make it cool and then repeat. If you do that, you'll end with a 30-40 Kph advantage over your opponents in the straights and an more powerful acceleration than the one granted by KERS.If you try to save fuel, to use your KERS smartly, and don't do like every other guy : you'll end outside of the podium, everytime, even if you do one pit stop and they do two. So, where is the strategy point if only one strategy seems to be working ?After 110 minutes of playing, i'm wondering about asking a refund. But I will not because I want to see where this game is going. So, I truct you guys, don't disappoint me in the next months and we'll be cool. But right now, i'm sorry but I can't recommand Trackday Manager yet to other people, it's just not enough polished for that.			"

												Love Motorsport? Are you a management type? then this game is for you. Despite there being a lack of tracks and cars, the game has so much potential, and the fact that this game is multiplayer only, makes it that much rewarding when you win, everyone is either friendly or keeps to themselves.The management part includes issuing orders such as overtaking, piting, fuel saving and when to push the car to and over the limit, you can also choose what tyres and how much fuel to put into the car.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing motorsport and/or management games.

												I've had this game since slightly before release and having seen the improvements made via updates I can say this is a pretty well supported game. I find the gameplay really good, of course some will find it boring, but I am a huge race fan. I've still yet to get myself out of the first garage but I have some pretty decent upgrades on my car so I can win races given the right circumstances.A bit of a Pros and ConsPros-Game looks great-Tyre wear is something you must think about-Sponsors get tougher to please the more you want money-AI are pretty smart with one caveat-Zoom all the way in for a roof cam-Private Custom lobbies can be created with the ability to invite friendsCons-Progression feels a little slow-AI are blindly stupid with rain strategy-Levelling up team members feels like it takes far too long-As of this writing there is no workshop support for tracks, which this game needs many more of I feel-In the main menu you must press escape in order to access options-No cinematic cameras that I have found during racesWhen you consider this is a small studio basically making Gran Turismo's B-Spec mode into a full game, the things the game does very well, and the things it doesn't do/yet, it earns a well deserved B+. It is a very focused game, it sets out to do one thing and it gets on and does it. If there were double the tracks, cinematic cams, and workshop support for tracks this game would get an A, maybe a +.Should I buy it?Are you a racing fan? If yes, buy it and get friends to buy it, playing against real people and trying to figure out strategy on the go is a thrill, especially when you get it right.If you are not a race fan, try the Demo, RTS sort of people may like it, and everyone else is probably hit and miss.

												This is my first ""NOT RECOMMEND"" comment. I'm watching development progress of this game for more then one year. Unfortunately i cant recomend it, and this is why:- Game is SINGLE PLAYER. I'm praying to have NO ONLINE OPPONENT, so I CAN PLAY it at all. Network code is REALY BAD, lags making this game UNPLAYABLE, and it isnt only my connection and my opinion. Lags are making your engine overheating, because of delay of overdrive button.- Pitstop is bugged - once they changed me wrong tire set. Another time opponent eliminated me by pushing me into pit wall and i couldn't move.- Tire condition is slowing your vehicle down ON STRAIGHT(!?). If your tires are below 40% u cant reach your max speed, like you are loosing torqe and horse power.- Sometimes I cant change tires type before race (buttons bugged, I cant click any of those).- Sometimes I cant give ""STAR POINTS"" to my crew or driver, because of bug.

								This game plays like an updated version of Grand Prix Manager 2 from 1996. You don't actually race any cars, instead you instruct the driver during a race when to over take, when to use extra power, when to pit, etc. The bulk of the game also involves obtaining sponsorship deals in order to earn more money for car upgrades. Although it is fun it is entirely focused on multiplayer, which is a problem because at the momet not a lot of people are playing the game. I feel like the $20 price tag is partially responsible for this issue, it seems too much for a beta of this sort. In my opinion a cheaper price of $10-$15 would ultimately attract more players, making the game more fun and involving. I would love to see this game become more populated so I certainly recommend it, but in all honesty the developers need to add more features before they can justify the beta price.			"

												Trackday manager?! ""What's this?!"" I thought when I noticed it pop up on Steam. Much like many other motorsport/sim racing fans I crave a modern motorsports management game. I genuinely can't think of anything in very recent times that was worth playing. Sure, other management titles have come and gone, but they fail to live up to my expectations of what I want from a management game.I'd come to Trackday manager somewhat late, having noticed they had an open beta period. But as they say, better late than never!So in I go, full of hope that one of the voids of my gaming library had been filled..... and after some hours I can say I feel like it has been, mostly. Let me get in to the details.What do we get?Cars, multiple cars. Each one has its own pro's and cons. Power at the cost of handling, vice versa or a balance of the two? Other factors are in here like cooling. They all look like real cars that you would recognise but, I guess for licensing reasons, They have different names. We see this often in the modding world so it would make sense here.Car customisation is present. You can change how the car looks with painting it, bodywork changes, wheel rim changes and more. You can also change the internals of the cars to improve performance. Some of these performance parts are basically a trade off. Lose some points somewhere like cooling to gain more in top speed, that sort of thing.We also get sponsors. Sponsors can be given treats like meals or gifts to help persuade them to throw cash your way in return for plastering their logo all over your car. Sponsors that pay more are harder to convince. You better perform well and offer them the right treats to stand any chance of signing them.You can also improve your pit crew, driver and marketing guy. The better you do in races the more points you get to put in their skills, with a cash cost also, of course. Make the pit crew jack the car up faster or the driver use the breaks later and more, you get the picture.Manager, you say? So no driving?You don't actually get to drive the car in Trackday Manager, well, kind of....maybe. You're presented with a top-down 3D view of the circuit which in honesty is pretty nice looking in my opinion, for what it is. It's in the style of a super modern skidmarks (Really old game). You get to instruct your driver on what to do in a live way, as if you were on the pit wall and literally hand feeding them instructions. Push hard, pass left, defend etc etc. Added to this there is also a KERS/boost button. You get a certain amount of boost per lap, adding to the required strategy & thought.Weather and pit strategy matter. You will use fuel and tyres, you will need to actually think about strategy. I have been caught out on drying circuits not pitting soon enough for dry tyres and killing my soft dry tyres, using them for too long. This adds a perfect and much needed dynamic for this sort of game.Always online?!the game requires an internet connection. Lots of complaints about this. I can't say I'm bothered. Though I think it needs one to even start, which I understand being an issue.You can have up to 16 players in a race. Multiplayer is where this game comes alive, it's absolutely fantasic. Being on voice comms with a friend(s) and in a race/championship matching up your cars, drivers and tactics against one another can provide hours of genuine entertainment and belly-laughs. It's worth noting, though, that, races can be full of AI unless you're grouped with a friend. I'm not sure whether this is a matchmaking issue or a lack of players. Fortnightly stats show 1,059 players have started the game in Steam. This could maybe be the issue. I feel it deserves more attention from gamers.So, what do you think?I think Trackday Manager is an attractive and worthy purchase for any racing fan. Especially at the current price of £8.99, well worth it. Best played with friends grouped up and racing together as it can feel a little like a grind if attacking it solo after a few hours. "

												This is a straightforward racing management game.  The depth is not in the complexity of the management side (e.g., no research, simple car upgrades, etc.), but in the actual racing.  Figuring out the right strategy for each track is rewarding, and the racing action is exciting.  Pulling off a double pass or holding off a car behind you for the last two laps of a race can be quite fun.Overall, I give this game a solid thumbs up.  It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.  Plus, I need you to buy the game so I will have someone to play against online (in 20 races, I have not met another soul in a race).			"

								After grinding through 46 races, and playing for 12 hours I afforded some upgrades for my cars. Went for better aerodynamics, and better acceneration. Equipped the car and off to the track... Where am I? you guessed it .... only human player on an oval in rain.... Been there before, wasting 10 minutes and ending up 3 laps down I opt NOT to waste anymore time and I leave the game... now what! ""Because of leaving the lobby I am restricted to race for 3 minutes.....""Guess what.This game is now officially restricted from being played on my computer for 10 days.... :)absolutely the single most stupid thing within this game, not having influence on the setup and knowing which track is up....tooo bad , cause this game was so promissing...This review is based on early accesw, and I might change my view upon it, if the developer fixes the above issue.

								I'm so excited to see this game even while its in development. I have so much fun playing its unreal. If you can't deal with server issues and bugs and sometimes not getting stuff you won or whatever, then don't buy it until launch. That still happens on the reg. But it is so fun to play already. The gameplay is great and the racing is incredibly balanced and fun. When this guy is ready for launch (literally I don't even care if it takes forever) as long as the key features are tight this game has so much potential. If they give it even more depth as they plan to....OMG Becky!I love this game (If i change my mind later I'll repost, since i have played thirty hours in like two days.... Wait? Three days? Oh crap! I think I lost a day?) "

												I've played this game since it was first released on Early Access. After playing today I just can't see myself recommending it to anyone due to bugs and poor matchmaking. I played in one Cup and was unfortunate enough to get a bug where my car would not pit which resulted in me running out of fuel and getting a DNF. The second Cup I tried to play after that, the first race was going well then halfway through the last lap with plenty of fuel. My position turns DNF with 8% fuel left, I was set to cross the line with about 2-3%. Then it says I finished 4th but I received no points for the Cup. On top of all this, every single Cup race I play in, I always end up being placed in races with other drivers who have cars that are much more upgraded than mine. This isn't a surprise, you can see it in the pre-race lobby where it shows their fastest lap times on that track. At that point I realize that I won't win the race except if they disconnect or run out of fuel or get hit with a bug. There is no way to race without other players to help give yourself a better chance to compete against the AI and not just get destroyed by other players and then increase the amount of time it takes for you to become competitive with parts they already have.

More advertising and community help, we could make this game rock so damn hard.Now you have like 6 tracks, camera topside or bonnet and 6 cars to tune and add sponsors.Game may feel at start hard, but soon you find sweet spots to overtake and tune your car right. Don't forget to add xp to your crew!And most races are human vs. AIRaces against human usually fails of somekind latency problems and net code.BUT!  Give this game a change and buy and love to it. Fastest 15 hrs like straight managering!PROS: MOTORSPORT MANAGER! Made with Unity!CONS: Feels like early stage at this pointPoints at this version:Graphics: 7/10Sounds: 5/10Music: 7/10Managering and racing: 10/10Overal: 8.5/10Soon more content coming so numbers rise.

												I could've gone on for days about this game, but let me put it this way:Yes, it has less content than Motorsport Manager, and on the face it, with only six cars and six tracks, it appears relatively repetitive. Thing is, you can have your strategy all worked out, but, like a classic Top Gear challenge, something is destined to go wrong. It could be a sudden thunder storm, or The Stigs Virtual Cousin could make an appearance. You have to consistently keep an eye for absolutely everything, just as in every other driving game - how are you doing on tyres and fuel, what is your opposition doing, how do you predict the weather will be for your last stint. Then it's back to the studi- I mean garage, analyse the event and change your car setup accordingly or maybe change car completely. Make your pit crew better to save time in the pits. Have your marketing manager contact more sponsors to bring in even more dough to spend on upgrades, which in turn will help make you more competitive and earn even more lovely monies.All that for about 1/3 of Motorsport Manager. It's not bad value when you think about it.What this is, is easy to understand and play, but difficult to master.Would I recommend it? If you enjoyed Gran Turismo 5's B-Spec mode, the team/sponsor management aspects of Race Driver: Grid, can enjoy a game that isn't about F1 cars and can live with the shortcomings a small development team - as should be expected - does have, then yes. Definitely.			"

So many things about it go unsung, like the ability to actually get an in-car view as the race car tracks the course, the sponsors are real companies, the fact that they used GT cars instead of open-wheel....so many plusses.  This game is incredible, I love the fact that it is more management than driving sim, there are plenty of those.  For the money, this is the best deal I've ever gotten on Steam.  I am looking forward to having a second car someday, and getting a larger garage.  Great game!  I like the fact that I mostly race against AIs at this point, that is good.  I can learn what I am doing without doing dumb things in front of people.  Kudos to Arctic Hazard, how something this fun and good got made is beyond me, but it's just the best.			"

												Yes, there are not thousands of players online right now, yes, theres the occasional glitch.However, this game (to me) is worth every penny.Most glitches that happened had me laugh my balls out!On average I race against 1 or 2 real players, which is fun in its own right, and sometimes you'll have AI only, which by itsself is also fun. Having an easy race (vs AI only) in between the hardcare strategy against real players is a nice change to relax and learn more about your car and its fuel usage/power etc.Sure, the game isn't perfect as of yet, but I find it heaps of fun and never expected to play it as much as I have so far.Updates could only make it better!

												Trackday Manager is a game where you're on the pitwall and decides what your driver has to do during a race. Not only strategical, but also when it comes to attacking, defending and using KERS. It's a great idea for a very niche genre in the game world. Unfortunately not many people are playing this, but the empty places will be filled up with AI's which aren't always easy to defeat. There might be some bugs in this game but they don't really occur and give problems at me. I really recommend this game!			"

Early Access Review
								Edit Oct 5, 2015: Still no support for north american servers. Game was developed for Europe and is completely unplayable in other continents as the entire game is multiplayer. This is the most disappointing early access I've ever been involved with, and that's saying something.I CANNOT SAY THIS LOUDLY ENOUGH: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PURCHASE THIS GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. THE DEVS ARE CURT AND DISMISSIVE OF ISSUES AND CONTINUE TO DENY THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEMS THE GAME IS CURRENTLY FACING.This a copy/paste from a forum thread where everybody is having the same problem(s):I had the same issue. Server can't connect and then I end up with a max cash stack.Update: I reloaded the game and my cash had normalized and the sort of tutorial thing restarted correctly, but I got into a race that my car wasn't in. And then the camera just stayed zoomed in to the starting point, even after all the cars had left. I have no idea what any of this was about. I'm all for early access, and I have backed a couple games that I'm really happy about. Sadly this game is getting added to the list of regrets for now as it is completely unplayable. I'm all for working out bugs, but there are several game breaking issues that can't be played around at all.I would highly recommend holding onto your money for now as there is no way you will get any entertainment value out of this game in it's current state.I am very interested to see where the game goes as I thing there is a huge amount of potential. The multiplayer aspect is fantastic and I love the core concept of the game, which I think is executed well. Again, sadly there are just some general  software issues that are preventing the game from really being playable.5/30 Update:Game still hugely buggy and devs refuse to admit it. Yes I understand they are working hard yadda yadda... but they refuse to admit they are wrong... No hope in hell of getting a refund. The community also seems to be full of victim blamers who claim that it's my fault that every race bugs out.			"

												Yeah I know it's not listed as single player but the game lacks any form of single player, the multiplayer lacks substance (and players) and the game is just completely lacking content.It's a shame, I love stuff like this but this just doesn't do it for me.			"

Early Access Review
								Never seems to find a race so I can't review it..because I can't play it..because it never finds a race etc... and so forth. I want to like it, I promise.UPDATE: So it seem to take some time to get the match up thing fixed but now you can actually race and it it pretty fun. The graphics are fine for what you need to do in the game and I am comfortable recommending the game even at this early stage though obviously like and early access it needs some work.UPDATE: So back to not being able to recommend the game. Log in and there is no car there... there was before, now there is not. Ok let's start over, it's early access, I made some mistakes, maybe start with the only other car you can start with. Nope, I see no way to start another career.Seems to have promise but wait until it's done before you buy it. I have fallen in the the early access pay for alpha trap and it is my fault. If you like testing hop on board, the game will be fun one day.			"

Early Access Review
								Please buy this game. Its not perfect but I get the impression a successful launch and focused devs could make this an amazing game.I'm addicted but and its a BIG BUT the development of this game will have to focus on real gameplay for me to stay addicted. Too many of these management games dedicate time, effort and ultimately my computer memory to periferal things that in truth are needless niceties. The Sponsorship element fits this category and whilst I wouldn't remove it I think the development should focus on a more balanced list of competing cars (I read someone else commenting on this), more in play commands (the current ones are good and pretty satisfying), a set up module and a practice mode which allows you to gain more understanding over the effects of things like tire wear and ECU settings. I would also suggest the option of longer races (obviously not 24 hour but maybe double the roughly 10 minute current run). Finally I would just point out a lot of the in game play is a process of trial and error as there isn't much in the way of detailed guides or instructions. I quite like this but thats why with this ommission a practice option is pretty much essential. "

												Have played it for about 11 hours now.Here's the deal:pro's:- AI isn't that hard to understand, you can make easy money- Gameplay is great, handle your own sponsors as well as the car livery and upgrades.- Unlike other people, have played with many other real life players- Chat works great, only a few cheaterscon's:- Sponsorships sometimes tell you to cancel with another sponsor and still won't make a deal with you- Can't make money very fast (Or I'm just bad at it)- Game lags terribly when everyone's pitting (AMD HD6770 2gb)Overall:Had worse games, please help the developers create a more exciting game.Great potential, average execution			"

												Game is fun at start but then I found out the 2 cars the 1 Raptor (pick that 1) and avalance is not balanced so that raptor is best at some tracks and avalance at others.....nope its all raptor.Racing sometimes there is way too much touching and no penalty for itToo many bugs and game is unbalanced, not worth more than 5-10 dollars atm as is.It should be released for phones as minigame instead, for a pc game its too crappy sry seemed fun at first but in the long run after picking the wrong car its not worth buying as pc game.My advice play some more funny games, this is not fun in many ways 20/100 would be my rating were I too rate the game as is.As car manager games too few stats no testdriving, and touching in a racing game is just a no go for any racing game that isnt a stockcar game its like they dont know what racing is about....
