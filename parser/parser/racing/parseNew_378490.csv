+ More enjoyable than it looks, I used to play games similar on my phone many years ago+ Visually Appealing+ It's neat to be able to do tricks in the air+ Extremely basic easy to learn controls (left-click haha)- A bit too simplistic for the PC market, I feel there could have been more features or more diverse levels- There should have been more power-ups to find and collect (transforming into the van is cool, but there should have been more of that or perhaps abilities you could use)- In the ""About"" section of the game it says ""don't lose your luggage performing daredevil stunts"", however the luggage is pretty much glued to your car. It would have been a neat bechanic if luggage fell out.- Mobile Port (I think this is a tablet game? I could be wrong)- Not enough content I'm mainly going to recommend this game to people who really enjoy Tiny Wings, and ""want more"", this game is fun for what it is, but it isn't much more.  "

												TL;DRIt's okay - there's not much to do after the 20 minutes it takes to complete the campaign, and the game is mechanically less satisfying than Extreme Road Trip.I was hoping this would play somewhat like Extreme Road Trip, but it lacks the variety of playing as different cars, and the endless mode is completely pointless. The reasons being that it's impossible to die, it's still segmented into levels, your score is reset after each level, the leaderboard doesn't function, and coins aren't used for anything. I'm still wondering why the tutorial says to ""collect coins to increase your budget.""The only goals in the game are to complete the 12 levels of the campaign, and to collect a souvenir from each. There's no rewards for this, only score bonuses. You can also go for the (in-game only) achievements to extend your playtime for maybe about an hour and a half, but then there's nothing left. This is a bit of a lazy port. It's not bad, but I can't recommend it either.			"

			Seth, Johno, and I wind up singing about 'Cool Dad's. It's pretty weird/amazing.		

This game is hilarious and a lot of fun! I definitely recommend it especially playing with some buds.			"

												First off I want to cover the graphics, very visually appealing to my eyes. The game is vibrant and colorful. The environmental levels hit a soft spot with me, the creators were not lazy just to have one level. I also found this game extremely addictive and I spend countless hours a day on this game.There are some downsides however, there are only two different languages to choose from (English and German) and if this game wants a chance at going international I would expect them to make this change immediatly. There also seems to be some problems with the landing, sometimes I would lose my luggage when I landed fine.The sound is also was a small issue for me. It was too loud and I had to manually go to my sound mixer and turn it down. The music was very enjoyable and the only option was to turn it completlely off.In conclusion there needs to be more options in the menu and more languages added and if so this could easily be one of the top games of the year.

												Shouldn't complain to much about this little gem. Its just a little casual game to pass the time, and the price is perfect. Needs a few twecks here and there but nothing major. Gotta get that controller support in the game(Which would be way bettter than the mouse) and add some more levels (DLC). Kinda has that retro 50's theme going.I like that. The music is cute and i love the sound effects. Especially the kids screaming while going up and down the hills and pulling off stunts. Haha Its a yes for me!! :)			"

												Sunny Hillride is a sick joke.It is an abomination upon the face of humanity.Does shoving broken glass up your urethra sound like a good time to you? Does it?Come on.I spent 31 minutes playing this games story mode and I felt devastated to find that there was one.If you are a fan of Bad Rats, ♥♥♥♥ you, you will probably like this game.Also if you like paying money for games that are free on your phone, or that you can find a better version of back in 2002 on albinoblackshepp, then have fun!No but seriously for 39 cents it was alright.

A light and colorful physics based infinite runner charges the player to drive through seemingly endless countryside never quite reaching their destination.  Are they running from the past mistakes or simply searching for a cliff to throw themselves off?The lack of diversity in the mechanics and level design drain the motivation to push through to later levels due to everything being the same as the first.
