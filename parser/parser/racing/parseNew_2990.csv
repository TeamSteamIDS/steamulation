												Very fun racing game! I used to have this years ago on my PS2, but I don't play that anymore. I finally decided to get it for my computer, and it's just like I remember: plenty of crashing and destruction!It's better than FlatOut 1 in the fact that there are better/more cars to choose from, and the same with tracks, but not with free roam. In the first FlatOut, you were able to go backwards on tracks and drive around the area. You sadly cannot on this game, but the racing is still fun nonetheless. As for the demolition derbies, they are also plenty of fun. It's nice when a game isn't too easy, so I do like the fact that there is a contact timer of about 44 seconds, meaning you have to smash into someone at some point. The AI is also certainly smarter than the first FlatOut, thus adding to the difficulty of derbies and races. It only has 3 more derby arenas than the first one, for a total of 6, so there certainly could have been a few more arenas.Lastly, you can't forget the minigames! There are oddities such as Royal Flush, Baseball, Bowling, and a few others where you have to fling yourself out of the car. These are pretty entertaining, especially with friends. It can get slightly monotonous by yourself though.All in all, this is still lots of fun for a game made in 2006!			"

												This game is sequel for original FlatOut, and this game is one god damn good example how to make sequel.FlatOut was awesome or should i say ""perfect"" arcade racing game. Though, its from 2004 and still, its kickass game with good driving response system, good and challenging AI, awesome tracks, derby bowls and stunt tracks.FlatOut 2 have all these same things, but it is made thousand times better!There is three car classes: Derby class, race class and street class. Derby cars are cheap and durable and meant for the first class of FlatOut racing. They can take a beating and deliver a powerful punch, but arent as fast as the rest of cars.Race cars are powerful and they are from competitive price range offer the 'best bang for buck' in the though in second class.Street cars are tuned up for the most competitive tier of FlatOut racing. Fastest of their kind, but a little less durable.In total there is 34 cars in game.Game race tracks are great. you can choose from many different enviroments to race and they are: Forest, Field, Desert, Canal, City and Race. In total there is 30 race tracks in game. There is also 9 special track events in game.Stunt tracks are also fun to play. There is 12 different stunts to do and they are: High Jump, Bowling, Ski Jump, Curling, Stone-Skipping, Ring Of Fire, Field Goal, Royal Flush, Basketball, Darts, Baseball and Soccer.Derby bowls is one of the best things in this game. Its all about earning wrecking points by dealing damage, destroying cars and ultimately surviving the challenge.The ragdoll physics in the sequel have been greatly updated. During the race, the driver may be thrown out of the car if slammed into a wall at a high speed.AI in this game is fine. You compete with seven bots in race at same time. They are challenging and fun, but they can be sometimes really cocky. Soundtrack is awesome in this game, it contains rock and metal music from Nickelback, Megadeath, Papa Roach, Mötley crue and many more...I dont know any bad sides on this game. Well, if you choose male character it looks like Paul Walker and it makes me sad sometimes to see it. But i dont think its bad thing, its just opinion.Im forcing you to buy this game because its so awesome and its definitely worth of few bucks. Love this legendary game!Sorry for my bad english!10/10			"

												FlatOut 2 came out just 2 years after its predecessor and was released in June 2006. That would make it around the time when I actually first played the game with my friends. Man, the game was good. Recently I have decided to try it out again, and to my surprise the game still rocks! 


YouTube™ Video: Flatout 2 - A 2016 Gamplay Review and Retrospective - Is it still worth getting? 

			Views: 2,411		

			A short review of Flatout 2 with the sole purpose of providing information on if it is still worth playing today? Thanks for looking!		

FlatOut 2 is by far the best racing game of it's kind that I have played. Long time has passed since the release, but everything about the game still seems really good from graphics to gameplay. Unfortunately there's no online but LAN via other software is possible. Do not fret though, single player is extremely fun. The AI is scripted very well. By the end of 2-3 cups you will understand how every individual AI drives. They don't always want to win now, some of them want to crash others players cars. It does not mean that it will always be you though. So expect some random stuff happen to you during the game. Never under estimate the opponent. 


Holy cow this is gonna be bad!

The  soundtrack just blew my mind. I do like the type of music that this game has, but to think that I know almost all of the songs in the game just makes it so much better. This game has lots of big names  like Rob Zombie, Wolfmother and .... Nickleback. But what's more important is that the car engine sound like a boss, the noise is so sexy, sometimes I just lower the music volume.

It been almost 9 years now, but the graphics will not hurt your eye, in fact this game probably eclipsed a ton of racing games which came out around the same time. Car details are very good, both brand new and half destroyed. The maps look just awesome, textures still look good to this day. Human ragdolls are a bit on the downside again, but you do not tend to fly out as often anymore. Overall, I am extremely happy about the graphics and how they are still so good even eight years after. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351276072What else is important about the racing game for PC players, a game that was also realsead on consoles? The answer is controls. Finally, I played a game, where you can easily steer just by using your arrows on the keyboard. Game is very playable without a joystick. It also feels that the developers made it easier to control cars in the first place. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351276142By now your thinking that there must be something bad about the game. Well, I am going to tell you that there are non big things that will off put you. There are minor things about interacting with physical objects, but that's about it guys, this game is almost perfect! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=351137260Replayabilty is massive, once you discover the LAN. To conclude, this game deserves the price. If there's no sale then just buy it. You will not regret it. The game is so good, you will end up driving at least for the next 5 hours before taking a break.			"

												Now this game. This game is from the childhood. Oh yes. The first second I booted up the menu the music memories just all came back instant. Like if they always were there somewhere. FlatOut 2 might aswell be one of the first video games I've played on the PC. I don't even remember the year when I played it. Around 2007-2010 maybe? But mah lawd is it a good game for me. Maybe a couple years/12 months ago played the Ultimate Carnage with my friend. Too bad the multiplayer ain't working no more. Would've loved that.The only downside I get from FO2 is the textures. Usually the textures don't really bother me but in FO2 the textures seem to blur the road so it's hard to see where you drive. Or it might just be the resolution, I dunno.Overall. Oh my god is this a good game. And made by Finnish people too! Recommend 10/10			"

												I nomimated this gem for the “Test of Time” Award in ""The Steam Awards 2016"", because after 10 years, I still enjoy the hell out of this game and many ppl do the same!Still rocks. I think this is the best in the series! FlatOut 1 was great too.Ultimate Carnage was good too, only GFWL ruins it a little bit.Chaos and Destruction? Worst of the series. Not even counting as FlatOut.Now we need only Crashday to be released on Steam!I have this game since the original release on disk! (late 2006)- Runs on a 10 year old PC and the current generation perfectly!- Fun to play! You can feel the cars, especially in derby.- Great OST. Great? AWESOME!- Variety of levels- Game modes (Derby, mini games...)Unfortunately the multiplayer servers was shutted down years ago.But the FO2 community still alive! You can find addon cars and tools to play online!			"

												FlatOut 2 is an absolute get! I can't recommend it enough!I was dying for a new racing game to play and happened to have a few bucks in my Steam wallet from selling cards and on a whim bought it for a mere $2.49! Which was an out right steal for this game. If I had known how fun this was I would of gotten it sooner, its regular $10 asking price is still a steal for this!Fun:• Slamming into people feels nice, heavy and like you're really doing some damage to'em.• It has variety in spades. Be it flinging your driver across water, through burning hoops or for playing poker. Demolition derbies, short simple circuit tracks and the varied longer race courses, theres a lot here.• The sound design is astoundingly good. It has probably the best tire squeals I've ever heard in a racing game. Most games have 1 long squeal which sounds more like the car is doing a burn out than struggling to maintain grip. In this it has a nice stutter to it, like it really is struggling and about to give. You can hear rocks knocking around your wheel well and under your car on the dirt tracks, something I notice games overlook a bit.• The cars are a great. With a heavy focus on muscle cars for the most part, which is great cause I lost my taste for racing games when they suddenly became mostly about nasty little rice burners (looking at you Need for Speed.). Only about 1~2 cars handled bit squirrely- *coughSpeedevilcough* -and the real only customization to the cars is being able to pick a color.• The AI actually will crash and wreck without you around, and the follow the same rules you are ei. getting hung up on random track debris and not taking turns perfectly all the time! They maintain a nice difficulty without ever truly being fustrating. Though I'm sure Sofia Martinez will be on your list of people you want dead.• It. has. Cheat codes.Meh:• The soundtrack is just well.. meh. At no point will there ever not be a guitar or drum playing. It tends to get a little grating to listen to near constant noise. Overall its not the worst soundtrack I've ever heard but its nothing I'd listen to outside of the game.Flaws:• Only real flaw I can think of is that the menus would not work with my controller.• Also you really don't get anything for 100%ing it. Quite the shame, least its a fun 100% to get.Only thing I wish it had was weather and the abilitly to mirror and reverse the tracks. In the end you should just get it. GET IT NOW!			"

												After 3.5 hrs of this game, I have decided that this is one of the best racing games ever made. There are so many fantastic features of FlatOut 2 that make it so exciting and enjoyable to play.In the game, you can race in the forest, desert, city, and more. You can start a derby in various locations where you try to wreck other cars and become the last driver standing. Lastly, there are 12 different mini games where you launch your driver through the car windshield and try to score (with the human) in a soccer net, basketball hoop, dart board, and 9 more different targets. These three game modes are also in the career. The destruction feature is great too. It brings less frustration to the game because when you hit a pole, you can break it and drive through, instead of putting the car in reverse, changing direction and then accelerating forward to your destination.The only downfall that I have found in this game does not even involve the gameplay, it is the music. The soundtrack is too small so the songs are played repeatively. This is something that happens in most games though.HUMAN DARTS!!			"

												Flatout 2, more adrenaline fueled arcade demolition derby racing ... but with ragdoll physics.  You crash and the driver flies uncontrollably through the windshield.  Arcade mini-games have you trying to hit targets with the expelled driver or reach higher jumps.  Great tongue-in-cheek fun.  Prepare to do crazy things to get style points and achievements!			"

												It's better than sex. I'm not kidding. One of the best ever. One of the best multiplayer games in history. Game's collision physics are superior than in any other racing title. And any other game, in fact. What it provides: the carnage, the adrenalin, the FUN. Purest fun. Derby mode alone is enough to let off all the steam after hard working day. When you strike some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the side on 100 km/h... It's one of a kind feeling. Too bad GameSpy is f\/cked. I had soooooo much fun with FlatOut 2's multiplayer back in the day... If you have LAN and one or two PCs-playing friends, try FO2 and you will have the best time in your life.			"

												Game from my childhood, was 11 years old, and edgy af. The soundtrack on this game is incredible, pop punk, punk, heavy metal and alternative rock set the tone for the fast paced, ridiculousness of this game. Career mode is grindy/linear don't. Bother just do the cheat codes and race with fast super cars, jam out, use turbo, and enjoy. The game is awesome in a sense of violence and stimulating crash physics. Since the vehicles (or some of them) move so fast you can hit jumps, or even other vehicles and completely TOTAL and roll your car it's epic. The game includes career mode, single race mode with a decent amount of maps to choose from, demolition derby mode which is awesome for that crushing stimulation, and a very fun and unique 'stunt' arcade mode where you play misc games like basket ball, darts, bowling, with a vehicle and the poor driver you launch out of it. Speaking of that, when your driver is launched out it's honestly one of the funniest things ever. Would recommend to anybody who wants good simple fun for a cheap price. (I believe you can play online with porting but I haven't tried, but if you can, you could easily get a good 10 hours extra from the game after playing alone gets stale)			"

												Straight Up:1st race:Winning the race a full minute ahead without getting touched. ~ 200 credits.Placing dead last while wrecking every car on the track... ~ 1400 credits. ;D~ My kinda game!In all seriousness, this is really fun. And you do have to race. My new go-to game when I want to blow off steam. It's got all kinds of cool races like figure 8's and ... just all kinds of crazy.It's like a Hot Wheels demolition derby game come true.I could see them having loops somewhere in it. Plays for real, but emphasis on trashing people. Fantastic.Made in 2006 so it runs like a dream. Looks great at 1080p.It really is a hidden gem.Better classified as: an ARCADE game on PC.Highly Recommended.White Zombie 7.1 for the Soundtrack on a Garage Door size Projector:Epic.			"

												One of the best arcade/vehicular combat racing games ever. More about high speed and destroying all the decorations, rather than Flatout 1 where the tracks have more tricky cornering and where you had to pick which objects to collide with. What I like:-Nice looking cars, they are based on real life models suitably. Though the models are somewhat low-poly strangely, Flatout 1 has more detailed models..-Pretty okay graphics still overall although NFS Most Wanted from 2004 for example already had more advanced things regarding textures, shaders and lighting system..I mean, FO2 doesn't have bump mapping, not all shadows in FO2 are realtime shadows and no realtime reflections either..yet FO2 has sharp textures in comparison for one.-Good sound design, the cars..although they kinda lack volume and intensity..FO1 had more intense engine noises. Ultimate carnage corrected the problem by having a clipping distortion effect for the player's engine noise, it made the fo2 sounds more aggressive suitably. The sound of small rocks in gravel roads pinging and ricocheting in the wheel wells is remarkably awesome and lovely to hear, makes the countryside tracks all the better to race in. Good crash sfx, when you crash subtly versus hard the difference is plenty audible :) although there could have been more crunching metal and stressing metal type sounds.-Handling physics, there is clearly difference between all the drive types. Though there could have been some handling nuances for some cars..aside of their grippiness rating, there is no other differentiation for the handling between cars.-The gameplay. Cathartic. You race with cars of 3 different type, derby cars which are beat up, slow yet durable old cars. Then race cars, something alike to scuffed and worn rally cars, they are 80's-00's era cars with moderate top speeds and acceleration, and mid range toughness. And lastly the street class with import tuners and muscle cars, these sleds are devilishly fast but lack in durability overall, made worse by crashes in that class being usually on high speeds :d There is the usual circuit races and to complement those there are the derbies where the one with most collective score from damaging opponents wins..not necessarily last man standing wins, the special event races such as a oval gravel track, figure of eight and some others. Lastly there is the silly stunts, where you throw your driver out of the windshield, for example to stick to a wall in high jump to score the best height. In all races but stunts, there will be crashing..often indirect crashing too, from pushing your opponent to an obstacle.What I don't like..No choice to have the bloom off yet the other post processing effects on. The bloom doesn't help to make an upbeat atmosphere, rather it is obtrusive and blinding..no idea how I back then played FO2 with the post processing on.8.5/10.  "

												 If you haven't got this game already, DO IT! FlatOut 2 outlives all of the other games in the FlatOut series, and by GOD will you love it! First of all, this game is not just racing. You can race, derby, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, blow yourself up, and the world's favorite: stunts! On the subject with racing, you can aggresively race, smashing people from their windshields, and smush them under your tire, or you can just drive on by.  If you don't want to race, then try some derbies! NOT what you expect when I say derby. You have 45 seconds to ram into someone, otherwise you are ""timed out,"" and disqualified. Derbies have no rules, other than: 1. Don't die, and 2. Make sure your clock doesn't hit zero. Ah, stunts. Glorious stunts. You can participate in High Jump, Ring of Fire, Royal Flush, Stone (People) Skipping, and so on. Each one of them has a different physic. But, in general, Pick up speed, drive foward, vault from your windshield, and reach whatever you need to. Maybe you want all three of these in a glorious interval. Try Career mode, which has you start from a♥♥♥♥♥♥hole, and gain money, to get more cars, upgrade said cars, and win even more money. Did I mention cheats? No? It would be a spoiler, so GET YER OWN DAMN CHEATS! On a seperate note, their is only one thing wrong: Online mode has been discontinued. [Insert millions of boos and sad faces here] But, overall, I think that this game deserves an 11/10. Beautiful.			"

												Flatout 2 is a racing game that has taken the ingredients from successful racing games in the past and fine tuned it.  The controls, the career mode, upgradable cars, multiplayer(you will have to outsource to find servers).  This game reminds me of a supped up PS1 Classic Destruction Derby that has finally reached its full potentials.  I've tried a lot of racing games but this one definitely is one of the best and should be mentioned in the top five.   Best part.  A developer from bugbear continued to fine-tune and tweak this game with a mod.  It exceeds all expectations.  But, if still uncertain, wait for it to go on sale and instantly snatch it up.  You won't be disappointed.

Steam version moddable, mod loaders and others compatible with steam version, tons of cars to test out, upgrade, etc. There's tons of♥♥♥♥♥♥to do in this game, from glitching♥♥♥♥♥♥ to going to a figure 8 track and watching the ai crash into eachother. Cons: Well, crashes. Rarely though. No slow-mo when you crash-out. :'c. No free roaming in the tracks as in the original game...Anyways, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing beauty. 10/10 for nostalgia and raging when losing a race10/10 for compatibillity with windows 8, etc. This game deserves 5 stars. <3			"

												This is arguably the best in the flatout series, It is a bit less expansive then Flatout ultimate Carnage which adds a few extra cars in the starting grid, and drivers as well as a few new/re-worked tracks, but it is my favorite having put well over 200 hours on my PS2 version as well as another 30 on my steam version 11 online 19 in offline mode. If your looking for a destruction racing/derby game with killer Graphics/physics, tons of action, and a killer soundtrack then this is the game for you, when your at the starting line and you hear Wolfmother's ""Dimension"" start you know it's time to mash the gears and hammer down the accelerator and get wrecking! and remember rubbing is racing, slaming your opponents into the wall that's Flatout!

												THE BEST Racing game EVA. I've completed Flatout 2 like 10 times already and it's still fun game. It's not about being first in the races it's more about crushing the first so that you could have the most points after the last race. One of the best things in the game is that you have NPCs with names and everyone has a role in the game - Sofia is one of the fastest, Frank has the unbreakable cars and so on. It seems like you are driving agains real people, which is Awesome!			"

												Big improvement over the first game.Strength of the cars is much higher, so the driving becomes much faster because you don't need to worry about blowing your car up after a few hits. Actually you can really feel the speed. Hits are also much more satisfying because of the star awards for every hit. Driver characters in every race also makes it more personal - if someone pushes you out of track or something, you can hunt him down afterwards, because every driver is different. In first game everyone was practically the same.There is also much more derby events, speedway races and stadium challanges, though i didn't like the show cars with the jet engines. Overall a fun game where even just driving feels enjoyable.Score - 8/10			"

												When i played FlatOut 2 at 2006, i really felt a hatred to that game because of crazy, momentary control-loss of old vehicles and i always sweared when that happened on races. Races with modern cars were a little bit more fun for me. Game soundtrack was amazing and well-matched to gameplay.Now, i bought it after those years and i want to play it again. I have to wait a little bit more since my dormitory internet has 4 GBs of download limit (ridiculous, isn't it?).edit: After 6 hours of gameplay, i can say it's worse than first Flatout. Physics a little bit crazy, some cars are unplayable because of that, even if you upgrade and try to drive them carefully, that's no use.After a while tracks become repetitive. Multiplayer is already shutted down (however there is LAN support).As i know Flatout: Ultimate Carnage is extended and better graphics version of FO2. But it has also Games for Windows Live. You might want to try that as well but i don't know if FO:UC will be patched before GFWL's shutdown.			"

												Feel like ""killing someone?"" Wanna see someone go trough a windshield? You suck at cargames? This is the game for you! NFS (Need for speed) is the best cargames out there, no doubt, but you can't make people fly out of the windshield! There are 2 ways to win a race, drive like a boss, or crash the hell out of your opponents! You win money for winning a race, but you get twice the money if you crash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone! DAMN STRAIGHT! To sum it up. There are stunts, crashes, races, ragdolls all over the road, more crashes and some explosions! HELL YEAH!7/10. Reason: Not that many cars, about 20 hours of gameplay to get gold in every event. And there isn't that much focus on the driving part of the game. Still, one of my favorite cargames!			"

												8/10 - An impressive demolition racing gameI don't really like racing games but this one stays installed and keeps me jumping back on to continue the campaign. Easy controls, cars aren't super annoying to steer. Extra events like street racing, high jump and more. Worth $12 - I think I paid $4 so grab on sale.

												One of my favorite games of all time. Played a lot when it came out, was nice to get it again. Lets of fun, graphics are great even now. Atmosphere and destruction is amazing. Takes 10 hours to beat. Music in this game is also great, but can get repetitive. Only downside is the fact that the multiplayer servers are not up anymore - would be a lot of fun to play with friends. All in all, one of the best racing games out there, beats competitors by a mile. Would reccomend even now, even though this is an old game.			"

												One of the best racing games even today. First time I was paying it I was about 12-13 y.o. and I f*cking loved this game. It has great soundtrack, good graphics and bots that actually can compete with you. Maybe the graphics aren't that great compared to the games that we see today, but it's good enough. One of the best soundtracks in games. Bots can really compete with you and you probably won't be always on the first place.			"

FlatOut 2 is in all a great game that fans of arcade fun takes a longer time, also thanks to the number of mini-games that it offers. The graphic can play basically nothing much to criticize, perhaps only occasional overlapping parts of the car (if you have a car with platform, here there passes a piece of the floor of the chassis, through the wings from time to time you see a piece of the wheel). The roaring sounds about as well as they should, hitting a metal pipe sounds metallic, into a tree and woody in all thunders powerful engines, which does not sound like the neighbor Fichtl. The musical accompaniment is composed of more than twenty stock from authors such as Papa Roach, Nickelback, Megadeth and Rob Zombie, and it certainly is not the item you off in the menu first. HW requirements are within the limits of endurance, which you can read in the table under review. If you do not desire for realistic simulation, but after a really fun racing title, I FlatOut 2 is recommended. At that price, half the English version, there's nothing better you can not get.Enjoy Game CZ/SK/ENG etc.			"

												This arcade racing game doesn't lack of color and have aged very well. Game-play isn't the hardest, but I won't advice you to make it your first driving game experience. Game gives you variety of tracks in different environments such as deserts, forests, suburbs etc., and and big variety of cars witch performance you can upgrade, however sometime it feels pointless, because opponents with same cars as your's still are driving a bit faster. Also sometimes feels that enemy's have mystical speed boosts and you'll have hard time loosing or catching them. Game gets a bit repetitive after time, but it refreshes it-self with funny events which often aren't really about driving. Game also has some well simulated physics for the time, however sometimes you have the feeling, that it works against you. One of the notable things in game is music. Game features bands like Audioslave, Fall out boy, Nickleback, Yellowcard, Wolfmother etc. These styles of music fits very well and I can't imagine electronic or hip-hop music in it. So at the end, game is ok, but sometimes frustrates you and isn't forgivable for beginners. You'll have a lot of fun with it, but there will be moments where you will wan't to punch the screen. I gave it 7.1. Thanks for reading.  "

												If FlatOut 2 proves anything it's that there's room for more than one type of racer that strongly encourages wreckage at every twist and turn, and it's refreshing to see that despite EA's undeniable might smaller developers are willing to have a go at competing, often showing them a thing or two about game design in the process.

												Flatout 2 is easily my favorite racing game of all time. It focuses on fun and enjoyment rather than wasting time with realism. The physics are funny, the soundtrack is great (if you like semi-modern rock music), The damage engine is good, The graphics aren't too outdated, and best of all, the driving feels great, even on a mouse and keyboard. My one dislike is that the menus have no mouse navigation, which is the only thing that makes me realize that it's a PC port.I highly reccomend this game to anyone, really. If you're a fan of silly physics, damage engines, and good racing, you will adore this game.			"

												If you have friends to play with (now only on LAN, via internet not supported anymore :/ ) this is one of the most fun racing games to play. Even though some of you might want to prefer power-ups as in Mashed or Blur, the amount of destruction in this game compensates for it sufficiently. If you want to play singleplayer, I think you won't be bored either, the opponents are quite clever and nasty. Last but not least it has one of the best soundtracks I could have imagine, because what's better than smashing some cars to the sound of punk rock :) 8/10			"

												Oh damn, this game is hard to describe without including personal memories but lets try!Do you hate love when you can go a bit rampage and aggressive in a racing game and show your love in form of a nice slam? then you will have a great time here. This game is literally made for fights and rampages, you cant win a race with just driving good. and thats bad and good at the same time, more to that laterThis Game has no story, you start, you want to be the best, done. A good point, I didnt miss a story and like that it doesnt slow down the game. But the game makes it feel like they didnt put a story mainly because they didnt have the money for it.We arrive at the problems. The Gameplay is great..but depends on your car. With the handy ones you can really have fun,  and with tuning even the tanks make fun (especially when you can crash everyone in your way and be a monster on the road!) but if you are no pro in racing games then you will frustrate. The AI is fair on the start and there you can really have fun: driving, crashing around and feel like a badass. fantastic. but then the AI is so fast and drives like on rails (while you drive like on ice) and acheives 300kmh easily. and scripted enemies....we all hate them. you can crash someone into a wall and he gets last, 1 round later he is 2cond again. The game is unfair, really damn unfair. your respawn sets you almost 4 places back (and you respawn often, trust me) and enemies drive like on drugs. BUT here the element I told comes in. crashing. you cant win without it because the enemies are way faster than you. so you need to master slamming an enemy that tries to overtake you in the perfect moment. But if you master crashing and put your focus on it muahahaha that game will make you happy. nothing is as pleasing as slamming into the back of an annoying enemy and sending it right into a wall! crashing feels great and looks great, the driving never feels slow and the crashes rarely feel annoying. ..if you master it ofc XDThere are also many little mini games that entertain a lot but as the main game..frustrating to the max, you must be literally perfect to pass them on 1st. and in the later game you only have speed rings an such. very sad because derbys are the most fun thing on the game and it isnt possible to take faster cars into a low class derby.now the main problem of the game: EVERYTHING ELSE THAN THE GAMEPLAYIm serious, this game feels like the makers didnt had any time to make anything else than the cars and races, and not even them are good made.we have about 20tracks or a bit more/less, so repeats are pretty often and nothing was planned. you cant see which races exactly or how many laps a cup will have (and the game only has cups!) neither we can play a single race in the career mode. you are foced to take a cup. they much probably forgot to add many functions. because the cups are based on points like normal (first gets 10 points, second gets 8 and so on) but you can repeat ever race as often as you want in a row, that takes both away. the challenge of cups and the fun of a single track. Cars..oh damn that point is sad. there are quite many cars and they drive different from car to car, but mostly in 3 areas: understerring as hell, drifting as hell, or like on ice. with tuning they will drift a lot but in a good controlable way (never take a full muscle car without tuning, even with max tuning some of them wont ever make a corner with more than 100kmh) but even here everything lacks. you cant tune any visual except the colour (on some only), but the worst..you can only choose it once! you bought it in black but want it blue? well sucks to be you, buy it again. and the tuning..theres no way to test tuning and once you bought a tuning, you cant uninstall it! nitro makes your car 3 points better in nitro but 3 worse in power (about) want to unisntall the nitro? not possible. The cars wont give you a good speed feel in 80% of the game, only full tuned cars feel fast and reach 250kmh or more. Music: Music is pretty okay, all rock songs (the sound designer was a extrem rock fan it seems) from back then very famous bands (fall out boy, nickelback, wolfsmother) that are nice to hear but if you dont like rock..you are fu**ed. and even every rock lover will hate the songs soon. why? there are only about 20songs! and since they all sound similiar you soon get annoyed by them, especially because..NO MUSIC PLAYER. seriously not even a single bit. You cant skip a song, cant play the last one, restart it, manage songs that can play or anything. heres a song, deal with it. sad when you restart a race 5 times only to have a song you like. songs skip everytime you join or leave a race, so you can control is a bit XD but yeah horrible. The game really lacks on all else than the basic stuff. you got no proper replay function, so if you had an awesome moment like a super crash round where you killed 4 cars..well no one will believe you because you cant replay it! (i recommend recording while playing because the game will give you great moments) I killed 6 enemies once and it was a photfinish with 2 broken cars but i will forever be the only one who saw it.the game really feels super small and repeating , the few things there are fun (and unfair) but it feels like the game was made either without love, money, or time (or all of them). If the game is in sale, i recommend, and if you love crashing in games and dont mind lack of content, try it out! no game I ever played gave me such a good feel in rampages and demolition, also it isnt so damn slow. But yeah, for fans of normal race games like nfs todays, I recommend you to not get this game, its fun, feels fun to play and is always great for a 15minutes playing, even till today, but you will wish yourself the makers added more. The concept and ideas are great and has potential they sadly never ever used.I love this game till today but even a hardcore fan like me hates many parts of this game.			"

												This game may be old but it is still a pearl.After about 10 years I am still having loads of fun playing this. The A. I. is actually very well done and varies depending on the kind of race/event you are doing and depending on what character we are speaking of. The graphics are actually quite acceptable for such an old game and the performance is great! (It runs on FullHD with 100FPS without any crashes what so ever)For a few hours of fun while playing through the career mode this game is definetly worth it! Especially when it is on sale as it goes for just 2€Only downside I can think are the rather small maps as well as no direct multiplayer support but users found a way to play together. See steamguides for more information.Have I mentioned the soundtrack of this game yet? No? HECK! This game is one of the best soundtracks I can imagine: Nickelback, Alkaline Trio, Yellowcard even ♥♥♥♥ing Rise Against. Truly some good music for every Rock/Metal fan!			"

												I am somewhat clouded by nostalgia talking about this game but it is great. It's great for it's time and it's still great for a racing game all about just having fun. Heck you could be the worst racer ever and still win money and complete things in this game simply by being destructive. Graphics are dated but eh it was ps2 era. Gameplay is where the game is great on all angles. Racings, wacky minigames, multiplayer if you got the means for it, it's all great. Difficulty jumps are pretty big but man this game is insanely fun if you put down the time to get used to your vehicles and practice.			"

												This games is probably one of the only racing games, if not the only racing game I have ever enjoyed playing. The single player part isn't much fun, but playing derby together with your friends at a LAN is so much more fu nthan prettty much all other games I have tried.The words ""in the♥♥♥♥♥quot; has been used regularly while playing this.

												Gaming is my life and, as crazy as it seems to me, Flatout 2 is the game I spent to most time on by far. Across all the platforms I've owned it on (PS2, Xbox, PSP and, originally, as a boxed version on PC) I easily spent over 3000 hours on it.Half Life 2 may be what I consider the greatest game ever made, but Flatout 2 is definitely my favourite game.

												Ok,this is the third racing game that is my favorites after Cars The Video Game (2006) and Need For Speed Underground 1,why i like it so much?Because of the wrecking and the soundtrack in wich i will never forget first time when i heard them in 2006-2007.This game have 3 cars classes:DERBY class:The easiest class to complete and here is the cars that you can handle all of them easily and contains DERBY destruction.RACE class:I found this class to be more specific for desert and field races like rally cars,and some of them is relly hard to control though.STREET class:This class is the hardest one so far in this game all cars are fast except 1-2 wich is more like DERBY cars,why this class is so hard,because almost all cars that you like you cant control them and spining around.Also the drivers are WAY more agressive in this class.The drivers that you must be ready to face of:Sofia Martinez:By far the most greater female driver in game and she is very fast.Jack Benton:This driver is the fastest in entire Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage and he can be a nightmare to you.Jason Walker:This driver with flames and skull on his car is the most feared driver,why?Because is so agressive in races,if you slow down ahead him he will hit you not going away from you.The worst driver in this game so far is:Frank Malcov:His cars are the heaviest ones and painted with america flags.Why he is the worst driver?Because in races you will see him crashing almost everytime placing on 8th place almost everytime except if other driver is destroyed by you or someone else.He is good only at DERBY destruction because of his heavy cars.Also the game has stunts that your driver can fly out of car,no blood even falling from 300 meters in air.If you are german i fell sorry for you why?Because the german version it was going to have 18+ because of drivers bodies that flying out of cars,instead they put model that looks like a robot.Also the soundtrack is relly a cool one with rock music.Also dont try multiplayer because its dead from a long time from Gamespy.But you can still play party mode with your friends.Final note:9.5/10			"

												One word. NOSTALGIAEDIT: after having this review sit here a while i would like to make it a little bit more serious.Good for the time it was made. Certainly at least a  7/10.Pros: Arcade like feel, very fun mini games, sturdy play system.Cons: Soundtrack. Seriously. You can really tell the year it was made from the soundtrack.AI is extremely predictable. Fred always wins derbys if you dont, Sofia always wins races if you dont, Kate will always try to attack you in derbys. It gets a little stale when you know exactly what the AI is going to do 90% of the time.SoundtrackA little buggy.(Minor things like destructable environments being driven through instead of being destroyed. which only happens with smaller objects.)A little lag between button presses and actual actions. This may be something with my system though, because i never had this issue on the ps2.Did i say soundtrack?Definitely a recommendation for anyone who wants a silly yet fun to play racing game.			"

												After playing Flatout the original, I was hooked,the racing dynamics of this game series are excellent,the overall polish of the game is very well done. So far Flatout 2 seems to be quite an improvement, I like the additional events that have been added,the derby style races are over the top, with powerups and bonuses for aggressiveness. So if you like driving games, the Flatout series will not dissapoint.The game also has great graphics, as well as, awesome visuals.			"

												Actually, reading here the section of negative reviews is more helpful to find out what this game has to offer. What the negative reviews basically point out is true: anything can happen, dominating the race and losing in the last curve; stuff on the track, dynamic or static, doesn't always lead to the same result; multiplayer doesn't work out of the box; car slides a lot, oversteers easily; AI is terrible;Well, this game is not about burning down the fastest lap. It's about battling opponents and winning. Chaos and catching up on the track is part of it. The sliding and oversteering feels like driving a rally car, to some extent, don't get me wrong here. It's fun. I completely agree that the AI is terrible, in my opinion one of the worst I've ever seen in a racing game: viciously ramming every car, even if the attempt leads to their own downfall. There are counter measures against this behaviour, but of course it's not possible to avoid every dull enemy attack.However... the game allows to restart a race immediately or to repeat the currently finished race, so losing to the enemy is not an issue. It's more about learning all the shortcuts, avoiding risks, so to speak developing strategies for different situations to succeed.Then, finally,... this is an awesome game!			"

												I bought this game in a recent sale, after view some videos and because it's cheap. Because gamespy is dead there is no more multiplayer, then I didn't try mp. The singleplayer is very funny, there's a lot of cars and races to run. The game is simple to play, no complicated controls, it's perfect to relax and have a good time after a work day. I think I can play this game for a long time and have fun with it, 'cos every race has surprises. You need to run and try to defeat other racers, and need to avoid and keep safe with a lot of destruction instinct.Oh, the soundtrack is very good too, nice songs, rock'n roll all the time.It's a good game, provides lots of fun, and worth the price.

Well that doesn't matter, because this game needs that word to compare it to other games, like Burnout, BeamNG Drive, or Wreckfest. Basically, this is fun. But just remember that Flatout: Ultimate Carnage will go on sale, and that will be better. Except for the Windows Live part. That sucks for Ultimate Carnage.			"

												A very, very fun arcade racing game.Got about 20 hours out of the campaign mode.  It had a fun variety of game modes; although some of the mini games can be very frustrating.  The racing itself is a lot of fun though, giving the player a choice, generally, between speed and handling.  There are also a variety of tracks in different locations.  The road surface affects the handling of the car.The soundtrack is noteworthy, and fits the theme of the game perfectly.If you're looking for a racing sim however, this is not the game for you.  The mechanics are solid, but not realistic.My only real negative was that you couldn't edit the play list, nor skip or chose your favourite song while playing.  Only a small bug-bear, but still.Game ran absolutely flawlessly on my phenom II x4 955 & 550GTX ti.			"

												While the first game was hard FlatOut 2 is beyond easy & hard. It is arbitrary, luck decides if you win or not and you as the player have little influence on that.There are two main issuesThe engine/the car behaviorYou cannot predict how your car will react during a jump or hitting an obstacle. Sometimes it runs smoothly, sometimes you will lose your position or advantage. Therefore there is little space in getting better or master the game, because you don't get proper feedback which action benefits you and which one will be punished.You will find at the bottom a video I've done about two stunts. The only thing I do is pressing throttle without pausing it, so there is no room for variation. I do this in both stunts. Two exact same actions from the player result in different outcomings.The AI/your opponentsSome of them are trolls, not interested in winning the race just ramming other cars and putting themselves at the tail end while giving you a hard time.The other extreme are the flawless ones, usually using one of the higher level cars which you have to unlock first. Catching up with them happens rarely. They usually drive clean and boost forwards if you are getting close. Starting at the last position puts you in huge disadvantage against those.The other thing is that the AI adapts to you. Are you driving faster or have you upgraded your car? They get better as well, so the difficulty seems to stay stable. At least to a certain point. Buying a new car with much better values makes the races easier, but not as much as I expected.Some small annoyances-The starting position varies, but most times I got the last place or something near that.-Later in the game you may have to repeat races a couple times to collect the amount of money to buy a car you've just unlocked. Winning all level 1 races doesn't guarantee you having enough money for a Level 2 car.-Strangely a Level 1 car isn't necessary good enough to compete in Level 1 races. I once had to grind for a better one and repeated the races.-NPCs get fixed cars from the start of a class and some of them get ones from a higher tier. It would be fairer if everyone would use a car from the same level.All in all: Driving good doesn't get rewarded, you need a certain amount of luck. Both, losses and victories, felt cheap and latter one never satisfied me. I was just relieved to be over the current race.Now the most important point:Does this all make the game unenjoyable? It depends.Are you looking for a serious racing game? Is anything but 1st place not an option to you? Then skip this one. It started pretty easy and was fun, but the further I got into the game the more the races turned into bitter and teeth-gnashing hours of retries which felt more like playing roulette and waiting untill the ball hits your number.If you don't care about the mentioned issues, because just beating the game is enough for you or you just want to have a bit random wanky car physics fun, you might wanna try it. At least it won't hurt as long as you don't take it too seriously and bite your teeth into it.Video:

												I fully played the game and finally made up my mind about it . Satisfying but not epic . I love it because of the massive chaos although any burnout series in the past decade beats it . The Devs should work on the vehicle handling because it is almost impossible to handle the vehicle at crashes , I know you wanna make realistic but you have to make this game FUN , I don't mind the sour taste of realisme but the handling is wayy too salty on the game . I love the destruction and the mini games , very creative indeed but the rest needs better ideas and tweaks but anyways the game's support ended a long time ago . So , in any future series of flatout please bear in mind that we need better car tweaks and more creativity in tracks because the races are wayy too short tbh .			"

												If you want a racing game that's more about luck than skill, then get this game!Gameplay heavely relies on the Havok physics engine, which becomes a problem when there's so much debree laying on the race track. At any flippin' secon you can be tossed around or completely flipped around by these. Also the many ramp jumps are highly unpredictable, there's no telling which way you'll land back on the ground. The jumps give you boost, which you need to win a race, but most of the time they just feck you over. Bit of a problem there.The A.I. drivers very blatantly cheat. Even if your driving is perfect, they can just overtake you without using boost. Game also has the most obvious rubberbanding I've ever seen.So much wasted potential with this one. Game could've been so good without these misgivings.Frustrating as it may be some times, game's still worth checking out. I will be finishing the game myself, out of cheere stubbornness if nothing else (22 hours in atm).			"

												This game is absolutely amazing.This game made up about 25% of my childhood and the nostalgic feels are crazy with this game. Set aside the memories, the game has great gameplay. Unlike your average derby game, this game combines derbies with racing - allowing races with collision as well. The game offers much more than just derbies, from silly and fun events (bowling, basketball, ski jump, etc.) to racing in tournaments. Flatout 2 has amazing controls and the physics in the game are remarkable. It's just simply impossible to explain in words how amazing this game is. 10/10			"

												""Careful"" yes...it's got more content than FO 1, more cars, more tracks, etc.However, the tracks feel very samey. There are different forest, farmland, canal, race and city tracks, which are very similar...what's the difference between ""pines"" and ""logging camp"" for example...pretty minor. The most interesting tracks only appear toward the end of the game, which is a shame, since the game is tiered into 3 different ""classes"" (derby, sports and street or sth. like that) and 1 class gets obsolete once you're done with it, only to buy the next best car in another class. Despite winning every race and event I still didn't have enough money to consistently buy new cars and fully upgrade them...and oh boy, do you need the new cars. Some cars are simply way better than others...sad story. I wasn't even bothering with the late game stuff. A pick up truck carried me throught the last 50 races or so.The driving and physics are ok, but FO 1 required a lot more senstivity. This game is for the most part pedal to the metal. Only in later classes and tiers will you ever need breaks, which is a shame. Or you could just rely on your AI opponents to simply crash into you to slow you down. I mean, yes, it is a ""crash"" game, but the AI is just nuts and a really bad driver. They will CONSTANTLY try to crash you, even if that means they wreck themselves (i.e. kill). They don't drive to win, they drive to crash. You. They go out of their way to get you, which is very annoying to be honest. I don't mind the crashing, it's fun, but there should be a race underneat, not a rubber band AI that crashes itself after every use of Nitro. The AI is bad. Very bad. Towards the end of the game it's so bad, that out of your 7 opponents, only 2 (sometimes 3) even pose a ""challenge"". Why? Because they constantly rubber band 1st and 2nd place. In. Every. Race. Unless you wreck them or crash them enough, so that they may only be in 4th or 5th place. This puts enormous amounts of pressure on the player to win every race, which is very hard if you drive perfectly, the AI crashes constantly, but still catches up multiple times. It makes no sense.What also does not make sense is the absurd amount of debris on the road, which your car either ignores or (perhaps when the game thinks you're doing too well) which flip you around like a leaf in the wind...inconsistent imho. Anyway, 14 hours for this game's SP mode...too much imho. Damn. The event games are cool, though, once you get the hang of them.			"

												My first instinct is to put a NO on recommending this game. That's because it's so often infuriating.The racing here is all about physics and destruction. You can crash into the scenery and your fellow racers, resulting in detailed and wild destruction.This is what makes the game both fun and frustrating. More often than not, finishing in first place is a matter of blind luck, thanks to all the scattered debris all over the tracks. I mean ALL over everywhere. The slightest bump will send you careening off into the side of the track. Same if you get bumped by a fellow racer.That's basically my only gripe with the game. Otherwise it's tons of fun. The damage model on the cars and environment is pretty great (I know, I was just complaining about them!) The career mode is nice and simple, varied, with a great selection of tracks and game modes and cars.Each car can also be upgraded in various ways. You could focus on speed and just go for the finish. You could focus on strength and make your car a high powered ram rod, disabling the competition.There's also the stunt levels where the already-filmsy realism is flung out through the windshield, just like your driver will be, flying into bowling pins or a velcro wall for points. Very silly, very difficult (at least for me), very fun.I haven't played other FlatOut games. People say this one is the best of the series. Check out the spiritual sequel, ""Wreckfest / Next Car Game"", here on Steam.			"

												…хочется сказать, что игра вновь удивила. Ничего сверхъестественного не произошло, но играть по-прежнему интересно. В основном упор был сделан на еще большие разрушения и графику. Реальности не осталось и в помине, но ее место заняла отменная аркада. Так что теперь Bugbear Software может идти на заслуженный отдых, а мы будем покорять все новые вершины в «прыжках в высоту», ставить новые рекорды скорости, разносить все и вся в щепки… т.е. просто играть в FlatOut 2.

												Fantastic ravioliIngredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												One of the best racing games ever. Even when I was younger, I spent hours playing this game.There are nice tracks, awesome music, funny dummy games (although sometimes a bit hard or tricky) and the driving physics are very well made. Graphics are decent, if you compare them to the game's age, they are still great up to now.9,5/10			"

												FlatOut 2 is always on sale for around 3 bucks and all I can say is that my 4 year old loves playing what he calls: ""Car Crash"". Once I figured out a good control scheme for my Xbox 360 controller that he can use with his tiny hands (steer with Left analog stick, accelerate with A and Brake with B) he got the hang of it. The music is pretty much inoffensive hard rock, the gameplay is super simple and the graphics are decent. All in all FlatOut 2 is a solid racer and especially good for little ones who want to play ""big kid"" games. There's also a ton of crazy special modes like trying to fling your driver out of the windshield and through flaming hoops and stuff. A little too advanced for the kiddies but it adds a unique dimension to the game.			"

An improvement over Flatout.The sound is good. This game is actually more fun than newer releases from other Companies.

												Top quality arcade derby racer!Only problem I have with the game that returns from the first is that competitors can have better paintjobs, especially on the Speedevil. The soundtrack is weak and pop-ish with the only hard song being the Symphony Of Destruction by Megadeth that you can only listen to in the Main Menu. I suggest downloading the soundtrack of the first game as it is far better and still fits with the game.			"

												Not a huge fan. I hate the floaty, unpredictable feel of the mechanics. The AI tends to be a little too good at times as well, and you really struggle to catch up if you make one little mistake. The derby minigame is fun though.Just me personally, I'm not a fan of this particular racing game because of the reasons mentioned above, and so I do not recommend it.			"

												There is almost no difference between the track pools of the three tiers (Derby, Race and Street), which makes the game feel very repetative.The physics feel off... Landing succesfully/driving through debris on the road feels like a complete coin toss. Either I get through it succesfully or spin around/crash.The only real fun I had in this game was the mini-games where you launch the driver through the windshield to complete different objectives.

												It´s quite nice for the 2,49$ I payed for, but not more.Long ago I used to play this with a friend on his PlayStation 2 and when I found this on Steam I thought it would be the same fun nowadays. It´s not. Of course, everyone should respect the developers a lot for the amazing physics, graphics and the astonishing AI the game has if you think of when it was created. But the best days of FlatOut Series are over: Servers are down, licence has been lost, gameplay is standart, there isn´t a real story and details are aged. I do not dislike this game for beeing from 2006, I just don´t think it´s really fun. For me it became quite boring after a few races and the stunt campaign felt completely unnecessary.

												Very likely the worst racing game ever made. There is absolutely no reward for driving well, luck plays a big role in every race, and the ""catch-up mechanics"" that the game uses are severely overdone - when you're in the lead, cars behind you get 20% faster, and when you're behind a few cars, they slow down like crazy and sometimes even crash before the finish line in an obvious attempt to let you win - which means there's no reward for driving accurate tight lines, and you only win races by *not crashing*, even if you drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥And there are wayyyyy too few tracks repeating again and again and again throughout the game, making it extremely grind-y and boring.The only reason this game has so many positive reviews is because it's being bought by nostalgic fanboys who've never played good racing games - NFS MW was released in the same year and is a masterpiece with at least 100 times the content of this♥♥♥♥♥♥game.Other game modes are sort of fun but not fun enough (or long enough) to recommend this game. Redeemed to some extent by these and by the pretty awesome music.4/10			"

												I hate to write negative reviews but this game more than deserves it in my opinion.Graphics, soundtrack, track design and cars all look great and the game looks like a lot of fun, but once you start driving it's nothing but frustration. The cars feel like they're on ice, it doesn't matter if you're driving through the dry desert or through a city, you're going to feel like a wet piece of soap. The tracks are littered with garbage and debris and even driving over small objects can make your car spin out of control or fly through the air. The gameplay is pure frustration, it's so bad that I thought there was something wrong with my Xbox 360 controller (which didn't even work without using Xpadder).I just can't recommend a game that has such bad handling, you could play as a wet piece of soap and it would handle better than the cars in this game. This is really a shame because other than that the game seems amazing. I'll have to get a refund because this game isn't worth the 1.49 I paid for it.I've played so many other arcade racers and none have such terrible handling, I'm baffled how this game is popular but I understand that not everyone might share my opinion and I respect that, so if you're reading this and if you're interested in the game, buy it and try it first, if you don't like the handling either you can always get a refund, so there's nothing to lose here.It's a shame, I really wanted to like FlatOut 2.

												Suffers from strong rubberband A.I that old driving games had to use in order to make races more interesting due to not having advanced enough A.I to have them actually race well. Nowadays it's just annoying.  The physics are also wank. Attempting to hit someone or land a jump will send your car into a fit as it digs into the floor. In a game about crashing into stuff, this makes gameplay tedious.Once the novelty of the crashes and ""wacky"" physics wears off, you're left with a frustrating game where you'll resort to repetedly slamming Jack Benton and Sofia Martinez into walls until they explode.

Posted: October 4, 2015
												Though this game gets a lot of praise it has some glaring flaws that you should be aware of, I'll touch on the good points first:*The car destruction looks very realistic, and you'll notice actual changes in handing as your car accrues more damage; when your car is badly damaged for example it will lose a wheel and handling will become a nightmare.*There are a wide variety of off and on-road environments to race on, from deserts, to cities, to forests, as well as some fun mini-games to add replay value. The named opponents and different driving styles also add some personality to the career mode.---However on the whole this game left me more frustrated than entralled, so now I'll get to the bad news:The handling in this game is just bad, to the point that it feels like you're driving a hovercraft rather than a car, and a single shunt or slight oversteer can sent you off the track into a wall. This is also counter-intuitive to the design of the game since you're encouraged to drive aggressive and crash into things, but when the margin for error is so high it's usually safer to avoid taking jumps or smashing into traffic lights.The single-player mode relies on the catch-up effect to prevent a single spinout from taking you out of the race, but in the (now-defunct) online multiplayer this is nonexistent - meaning a single oversteer or ram from an opponent in the first minute of the race can take you out, which is frustrating rather than fun in an acade racer.Aside from that, the game's musical score feels out of place for a destruction-oriented racing game, consisting mainly of pop punk, emo, and alternative rock tracks - it seems to have taken a cue from the Burnout series here. The graphics are also a little too bright and cheerful for my taste.The final notable flaw is the unbalanced cars. The game is divided into 3 classes of cars, and each class has 1 or 2 high-end cars which are far-and-away superior in every respect to the others in their class. In multiplayer this means that nearly everyone will just end up driving the same car in every race, while the others just go unused.While this isn't a terrible game, on the whole I consider it overhyped and overrated; though the single-player mode may offer a casual racing diversion to some.

Nostalgia can backfireI remembered this to be a fun game, but now when I played it again for the first time in several years I was quickly reminded of its shortcomings.Flatout 2 is the only car game I know of where you are punished if you drive fast and have consistent lap times.Because by doing so you make the AI opponents drive even faster.For example.You are flat out 200 km/h with nitro boost, then out of nowhere an AI car comes flying past you...So to win in the later stages you have to convert the races to destruction derbies.In multiplayer its not possible to add AI opponents.The driving itself is fun so if this game is on sale, go forth and buy it, but otherwise, let this game die as you remembered it.

The Good:-Good destructive fun-Much more content than FlatOut 1 with Race and Street mode, with lots of new Events.The Bad:-There are too many forks/alternate routes that lead to manufactured collisions compared to FlatOut 1.-The destruction overall is much more manufactured than FlatOut 1. Most of the time you can either choose to jump, which will lead to a crash, or you can drive to the side which either has obstacles/a pipe on the floor which will make you spin. That's not a lot of fun and can get pretty frustrating.-College Rock soundtrack isn't really to my taste.-There are some small audio bugs such as glitched engine noise, no engine noise and tinny sound quality (especially in tunnels), and visual bugs such as clipping.The Ugly:- Tracks just have way too much clutter on them. In FlatOut 1 most of the clutter came from tyres from tyre walls, in FlatOut 2 you have all kinds of clutter that obscure the view of the track. Most of the clutter also has 'weight' which means that if you drive into it then you'll collide with it instead of just driving over it or through it. This normally wouldn't be so bad, but because there is so much clutter it usually covers the width of the track so you have no choice but to collide into it. Driving in 1st person mode it can get very tricky when this clutter attaches itself to the bonnet of the car, obscuring your entire view and making you have to change camera. That's just poor design.The game has partial controller support with the racing being fine with the gamepad but the menus are only navigational with a keyboard.Overall it's not a bad game, if you haven't played FlatOut 1. FlatOut 2 has more content, but I much preferred the track design and organic destruction of FlatOut 1.			"

												I am not a fan of the franchise, neither I played it back in the days. I naturally tested 1,2 and UC in a week term and I must admit - this particular game is boring. To begin with, it's built on the same engine from the original flatout with addional post-effects thrown on top of it. And those are not good post effects, but some cheap brownish-orange overblurred sepia, like in GRID. They took the first game, increased the speed and added explosions, basically, they made a BurnOut out of the good game. Honestly, I tried. I finished the first tier for all golds, and on the second tier I realized it's overly boring. The original FlatOut was way more catchy and it was unique at the time. FO2 is on the other hand just a copycat of other popular arcade race games.			"

												Flatout 2 has the same developer and publisher as the first game; and yet, somehow, they've managed to make it feel like a cheap Flatout ripoff.The innovative damage and driving system of the first game is gone, replaced with arcade style physics instead. Missing as well, is unlocking the entire tier of cars in one go, rather having to unlock individual cars as you compete, entirely precluding you from being able to save up for the car you want, and carry it through the tier with you, as with the previous game. Vehicle upgrades are also severely limited when compared to the first game as well, with only one tier for each upgrade, and many upgrades from the previous game being entirely absent. All the vehicles more or less handle the same, despite this game having differences between FWD, 4WD, and RWD cars, with weight and strength not coming into play at all with the exception of during derby events.Level design makes no logical sense, with entire structures appearing and disappearing with track layouts that are supposed to be in the same location. All the tracks feel as though they were designed as race tracks first, and the copy and pasted into the game's various locals, rather than designed from the ground up to suit that location. As a result, all of the tracks feel more or less the same, with different scenery adorning each one, rather than different and unique challenging locations.Gone as well is the previous game's unique soundtrack, replaced with generic pop and rock music. While I have nothing against the songs themselves, they take away from the ""country and backwoods"" feel of a derby-style racing game, and replace it with something that feels like it belongs in Need For Speed: Underground.All and all, I cannot recommend this game. It is held aloft almost entirely on the success of its predecessor, but with about half the production budget. I recommend buying the first game, and forgetting this travesty ever existed.			"

												The lack of proper 360 controller support makes this game a fail for me. You have to use the computer keyboard to navigate the menus (a mouse won't do it). I usually have my laptop connected to the TV with the top down. So, a minor gripe becomes a major pain.I'm new to steam - so I'm still getting to grips with the limitations of older games. As for the game itself. I don't care to be honest - I'll find a more up to date driving game with out of the box controller support that just works.Yes, I know that this game predates the Xbox 360 controller and that you can configure your 360 controller to act like it would for any other driving game - but having to use the keyboard to get from one menu to the next when you're used to simply pushing a botton on a controller gets really old, really quickly.Thumbs down from me.

												One of the best racing titles to its release date. It is totally amazing. Soundtrack, maps, cars, events, totally awesome.Also the multiplayer was awesome, before they ruined it.It had also an amazing multiplayer experience, but they closed it.It is an awesome game but i cant recommend it because of no multiplayer.Pardon my spell, if i typed something wrong.

												All I can say is this is no doubt one of the better arcade racing games out there. I find it better than burnout in some ways but in some ways not better.  But if you want to have fun with some friends this is the game to play. Very many random moments and crazy crashes. If you want to do something even more fun, Bus derbies are the best and no doubt funniest things you can do.Overall I have enjoyed this game alone and with friends so it's a definite must have if you like next car game (and Bugbear games!)

There was a number, that comes after ""2"", but I can't remember. It would be nice to have better graphics, a larger playlist (soundtrack) and a more refined upgrading system for the cars. The game doesn't need much more improvement.			"

												11/10, ONE OF THE BEST RACING GAMES EVER! Even if it is 8 years old, its still a mighty fine game, along with the other flatout games and the new Next Car Game this is a great series, the only downside is that the online multiplayer is disabled so you can only pay against the AI or your friend on a minigame, apart from that its a great game, why cant more racing games be like this and Burnout, unfourtunetly it doesnt support an xbox 360 controller so your stuck with the keyboard, but overall, loved it, finnished it and would play it again, its a good laugh to put up on the tv and see what crazy stunts we can do on the multiplayer minigames.

												FlatOut 2 is pretty good. I mean it's not Burnout, but the aggresive AI is brilliant, the soundtrack is great and the derby's and stunts give the game some extra replayability.Another reason I like it, Is that it is a great alternative to FlatOut Ultimate Carnage. You don't have to connect to Live, it isn't as CPU intensive and it essentially the same game. For £1.50 in the sale, can't go wrong.			"

												A great improvemnt compared to Flatout 1. Comes with better graphics better selection of cars, tracks, derby maps, and arena modes. (in Flatout 1 you need to unlock the arena and derby maps in the carrer mode {kinda dumb}, not in Flatout 2, they are already playable from the first second you play the game. Highly reccommend if you like to race but enjoy destroying other oppents cars at the same time! Multilpalyer no longer is supported so you're stuck with single player. Not like it matters, the game is awesome enough as it is.			"

So worth it :D+ One of the best arcade racers+ Lots of cars to buy and wreck+ Crashing into people/things is satisfying+ Solid graphics that aged well+ Side events & derbies+ Easily 15 hours of playtime+ Cheap when on sale- Sofia Martinez, the girl who's always in front of the race- Occasionally a traffic cone can vault your car into the sky- Music can get repetitive, but you can just play your ownEven if you're not into racing but enjoy trashing other people's stuff, this game is for you. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed ruining a person's car, or sabotaging them early into the race just because they might threaten me later on :D You won't find many games like this one, and while I loved Burnout Paradise .. this one is just better to me, aside from graphics.

												Played it on the xbox with my brother a long time ago and had hours of fun. Picked it up for a crazy price on sale and its almost exactly as good as I remember it. There are alot more negative reviews for this game than I though there would be, and most of them seem to be whining about the controlls and difficulty level. I suck (hard) at all games but there is nothing difficult or unfair about this title. I'll agree that there seems to be some crazy rubber-banding when it comes to ""Sofia Martinez"", though. And, if you buy all the weight reductions for your car it can get a bit touchy and floaty. Just dont buy all the weight reductions.Overall, a great game for a very fair price.			"

Personally, I love this game because I have played it on the Playstation 2 and on the Xbox.  Controller would be nice to have, your mouse is obsolete for this game, you only need AWSD and/or arrow keys. Addicting, fun, and challenging! Worth the  $9.00. A steal at the $2.49 it WAS on sale for.			"

												One of the grooviest arcade racers on Steam, despite its age.  Simple controls, fun tracks, destructible environments, large selection of unlockable vehicles, and a real feeling of weight to the cars (compared to some race games) make this a must-have.  Even the cheesy music by Wolfmother, Nickelback and the like seems appropriate.  Proudly sits between Dirt 2 and Insane 2 in my collection as one of the best PC race games I own.			"

												Never got to experience the online gameplay, but i heard it was really fun.But the singleplayer is not any worse as this is one of the most fun singe play racing games i have played, and it also has an amazing soundtrack. Also the minigames are really tricky and fun.Really recommend getting this game.			"

												This is one of my childhood favorites. Car handling is great, even on keyboard. AI are not too difficult, they all have a typcal way of racing (read: ""Screw you, Jason. Stop aiming for me, you #?'##^/; ""). The music opened a new world for me there are  nice ways to get Tinnitus. The stunts are a bit hard, but (unlike FO1) there is a tutorial to guide you, and after a couple attempts you get the hang of them. And if you can get a multiplayer game running (on- or offline), it gives you some couple hours more fun.			"

												Far ahead of its time, it still holds up today! One of the best racing games ever, in my opinion. Sure, new racing games HAVE collision mechanics, and carnage... But is that one of their main selling points? Nope.This thing is fun in every way a racing game can be... Well, besides Mario-Kart style weapons. That woulda been neat. Putting a rocket launcher on your broken-down Mini Cooper. But seriously, besides that, which is a matter of OPINION, this game has it all.			"

												 ""An extreme classic which is a fast loading time consumer where you never have a clean race.""Quite simply; Burnout with character. Burnout is all about crashing at speed, whilst Flatout 2 is much about racing with anyway possible. Whether it's smashing the opposition into trees or smashing through shops to gain nitro, every race is different, fun and action packed.If you enjoy burnout and/or Flatout, then this is perfect. Although Flatout based around 70's American muscle derby racing, Flatout 2 expands into tuner and exotic classes and even a school bus (best vehicle in the game). This gives it more variety and a more satisfying time. Of course, being a Flatout game, the bonus games are as silly and unique as before. Only this time the stunt cars have the minor addition of jet engines. There is also a character system, which tells you who is ahead and who you just T-boned off into a river. This can cause serious grudge matches and is useful for long championships. Overall, this game is simply an expansion of Flatout, with twice the destruction, twice the action, and of course, twice the fun.			"

												One of the grooviest arcade racers on Steam, despite its age.  Simple controls, fun tracks, destructible environments, large selection of unlockable vehicles, and a real feeling of weight to the cars (compared to some race games) make this a must-have.  Even the cheesy music by Wolfmother, Nickelback and the like seems appropriate.  Proudly sits between Dirt 2 and Insane 2 in my collection as one of the best PC race games I own.			"

I recommend this game but check out game play videos before you buy (just in case)!			"

												My hours are probably wrong, plus 5 or 6 to this total, was in offline mode sometimes.Probably the most fun racing game on steam. The Sofia Martinez chick is one irritating b1tch. Everything in this game is perfect, the only thing i would have changed is the drivers. For example: i would have put different drivers in the Racing Class and different ones in Streets, so on. Or it could be the same drivers, but then they had to change their performances. Jason Walker should be good in the Streets class, but♥♥♥♥♥♥in the Derby/racing class. But except for that everything is perfect, buy the absolute minimum in the Derby class, so u can buy a decent car in the next class. 9/10.			"

												I had the original Flatout for PS2, and while the 2nd one is better in its racing and derby, I definitely remember while I stopped playing after a while. The first FO had better mini games, even though I don't think they gave you any money/credits for winning like this one does. The controls and physics in the FO2 games and events are way too hard and wonky to ever win unless you spend hours upon hours practicing. The variety of games is nice though, even if the high-jump now has ridiculous new requirements and obstacles in order to actually post a score xPFlatout has always had really random physics. You can run over some fences and cones, but hit a box and suddenly it gets underneath you and you're suddenly facing the wrong way? And everything will turn you the wrong way! I flipped end over end for a good 100 yds, spinning around twice on my trunk, and without fail landed facing the wrong direction. Every single time! The walls and barriers have magnets in them too, so all the metal in the front of your car instantly finds the nearest one and is plastered there - unless heaven forbid you hit the brakes and The racing from 'derby' through the 'racing' class is fun, even though the tracks get old. Once you hit 'street', prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ As the cars get lower, everything will mess you up as it gets under the car - which makes sense. But what doesn't is the seemingly nothingness that will send you spiraling out of control. ""Ohp, you hit a small bump; better not over-correct and face the wrong way!""The street class upgrades are a joke too. 4300cr for .1 handling!? Really?!All in all, a fun game and infinitely better than Flatout 3! Best to only do a little bit of the 'street' class and just max out 'derby' and 'race' to keep the game at max fun - and do demo derbys! You get really adament about smashing your most hated rival, lol.			"

												FlatOut is one of the many car games but in my opinion its probably one of the best car games ever. It has really good destruction and a really nice Soundtrack. The games was made in 2006 but I still think it has really good ghrapics. I remember first time playing it was when i got my PlayStation 2, about 9 years ago and back then it was the best car game i had played. I still think its one of the best car games but not the best.If my English was bad, then sryGood things about the game.1. Amazing SoundTrack2. Really nice ghrapics desbite being a game that came out in 20063.You can not only destroy you own car, but you can also destroy the other racers cars, ram throug buildings, Gaspumps, Pipelines and much more.4. The game has a decent length to it, its not to long or to shortBad things about the game.Still looking for bad thing about the game? well i cant find any thing there is bad about the game.			"

												Flatout 2, in my opinion, is one of the best arcade raceing games you can find and I'm not just saying that because of the nostalgia I have for playing it on Playstation2.Pros:+Graphics: For a game that came out in 2006 on the Playstation 2, it looks amazing. I would even say it's Playstation 3 good.+Gameplay: The controls are simple but fun and there's plenty of gamemodes to make the price well worth it, from career mode to single races, minigames to demolition. The tracks are filled with hundreds of collidable and destructable objects to smash through, windows, furniture, billboards, fences, barn walls, ECT. The minigames are one of the best parts of the game, how can you not love hurling your drivers ragdoll body into a dart board or row of bowling pins?+Very little glitches: Ignore the hours Steam says that i have played because I've spend a good few dozen hours back on the PS2 and I hardly run into any glitches. Really the only ones I seem to find is the rare object floating or getting stuck in your car for a few seconds, nothing gamebreaking.+Soundtrack: The choice of music in Flatout 2 is amazing and I would dare say comparable to the older Tony Hawk games. Some of the bands featured in the game are Bad Religion, Megadeth, Yellowcard, Fallout Boy and Nickleback.Cons:- Controller support: Although you can use an Xbox 360 controller, it's only partially compadable, but to be honest I don't find it to be that big of a deal, just a bit annoying. You can't pause with the controller or navigate the menus, because controllers only work when racing.-No online support: Don't get this game if you're looking for a racing game to play with friend online, because it's a a port of a Playstation 2 game.-Sofia Martinez: ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥♥! She's always right behind you and the smallest mistake can have her to pass you up.			"

												A relatively old video game. It gives you a lot of fun with its car-wrecking features, with stunning graphics of the cars and the environment, mostly destroyable. Also great physics and nearly realistic driving. Like most racing video games, it has nice soundtrack songs, but it will be greater with more songs (too few songs, I think). And the part I liked most is its suitability for low-end PCs.Really, this game is awesome. With minimal PC specifications, you will get great experience.If only you could enjoy the scenery in-game, you would admire its beautiful graphics. But I guess once you race, you will completely ignore the graphics and focused to the race, while screaming angrily and swearing over the AI drivers driving your car out of the track.Very recommended			"

Just like the PS2 version but at a much higher resolution and better graphics, I can now actually see what's coming up on the track unlike the PS2 version which is just a blocky mess. This game supports controllers although you do have to configure them in the settings menu, my only complaint is that you have to use the keyboard to navigate the menu's which makes it a bit of a pain if you want to sit back and play on your TV.

Pretty much every day I would play through some of my favorite cups, racing the same maps over and over again, trying to get the biggest crashes, the nicest drifts and new track records. It's hard to say how many hours I wasted on it back then, but I'd wager at least 200.Today, I booted the game up on Steam for the first time, and I'm glad to report that it still holds up.FlatOut 2 is a game from an era when game developers still hadn't forgotten that games are supposed to be fun, and indeed, it still stands as one of the most fun and manical arcade racers you'll find anywhere. Take it for what it is, and you'll have a blast.			"

												...So you drive your junky vehicle on 160 kmph crashing opponents and yourself. Then you pick up a rocket car and fly away through the window of your car into the wall.One of the best racing games of all times. Nice graphics and physics for 2006, awesome soundtrack and hilarious gameplay!HIGHLY RECOMMEND!			"

												This game is about going flat out whit cars that crash, and then you finish and then you are happy a few because you realize that life is short and meaningless, so you stop seeing your friends, and you beat your girl, and start to drink things you never did, like Vodka whit a little water, and you never do the dishes anymore so they start to get roach partys on them, so when you want to eat something but you arent still in the point that the roachs in the plates dont bother you, you eat whit your hands, but then you eat everywhere, and you start to stink and lose your job. And then one day you open your eyes and realize you´re living  a nightmare that you created yourself.			"

												One of my favorite games back in the day in the original Xbox era, if there were any games I played the most it would be this and Halo 2. I reccomend using a controller for this, to get more precision while driving although it does work fine with keyboard controls. You may not think this game would be about precision turning and racing, but it really is. To win in the later races, you need to really know the tracks and drive precisely. This was made by bugbear, who make great racing/demolition games, also check out ""Next Car Game"" which is just like Flatout 2, made by the same team, but with an amazing destruction and physics engine.

Думаю, что Flatout 2 это удовлетворение тайных желаний многих игроков. Посудите сами - множество отличных трасс, куча машин на любой вкус, неплохая система повреждений, отличный ИИ с ""характером"", отличная графика и звук. Разве этого недостаточно, что бы отлично провести время? А ещё можно с друзьями по сети поиграть на выживание. "

You won't regret it (i got it for 2,49€ and it was the best investment i made in a long, long time... even for 10€ it's totally worth the price).This is how a PC game should be.Btw, it runs fine on Windows 7 64 bit, in Full HD.

												This game is about going flat out whit cars that crash, and then you finish and then you are happy a few because you realize that life is short and meaningless, so you stop seeing your friends, and you beat your girl, and start to drink things you never did, like Vodka whit a little water, and you never do the dishes anymore so they start to get roach partys on them, so when you want to eat something but you arent still in the point that the roachs in the plates dont bother you, you eat whit your hands, but then you eat everywhere, and you start to stink and lose your job. And then one day you open your eyes and realize you´re living  a nightmare that you created yourself.			"

												This game is the base of Flatout: Ultimate Carnage. I got this game at release back in 2006, and it was my main game for about two years until Ultimate Carnage came out. I then played Ultimate Carnage for another two years straight. What can I say, the two games are fantastic. Burnout, Need for Speed.... You won't find any other better racing games. Flatout is the dominant figure in racing.			"

												One of the grooviest arcade racers on Steam, despite its age.  Simple controls, fun tracks, destructible environments, large selection of unlockable vehicles, and a real feeling of weight to the cars (compared to some race games) make this a must-have.  Even the cheesy music by Wolfmother, Nickelback and the like seems appropriate.  Proudly sits between Dirt 2 and Insane 2 in my collection as one of the best PC race games I own.			"

												Flatout 2 is a great and fun game to play with your friends, It's become a tradition for my friends and I to play it everytime we go to a LAN. The game provides a various selection of vehicles, we're speaking busses, cars, trucks and 'batmobiles'. Fast and slow vehicles, all fun to race with or go into a derby arena with, battling it out by ramming into each other. I personally find the derby mode with friends during a LAN extremely fun, time starts flying and before you know it, you have all spent hours on this game, with a great laugh during the process. A reason for this car game being more entertaining that others, is not just the derby mode, but also the stunt mode, which provides challenging objectives which might result in you wrecking a car, which looks smexy with the games dynamics! Got friends to play it with? Friends also soon getting this game? Definately worth getting then.			"

That said however, I do find the handling a bit clunky, which is something that the team at Bugbear thankfully picked up on in Ultimate Carnage. But thankfully that's the one single complaint I have about FlatOut 2 among countless praises. And at 75% off at the moment, you really can't go wrong!8/10			"

There are alot more negative reviews for this game than I though there would be, and most of them seem to be whining about the controlls and difficulty level. I suck (hard) at all games but there is nothing difficult or unfair about this title. I'll agree that there seems to be some crazy rubber-banding when it comes to ""Sofia Martinez"", though. And, if you buy all the weight reductions for your car it can get a bit touchy and floaty. Just dont buy all the weight reductions.Overall, a great game for a very fair price.			"

I can't tell you how much I enjoyed ruining a person's car, or sabotaging them early into the race just because they might threaten me later on :D You won't find many games like this one, and while I loved Burnout Paradise .. this one is just better to me, aside from graphics.

												TL;DR - If you like arcade racers, you'll love this. Just buy it already.There are 3 classes of vehicles: derby, race and street. The career mode has you starting out with the derby class, earning money by doing well in races. You buy a vehicle, upgrade the vehicle and you can buy more vehicles if you want to change cars depending on the track. There are no power-ups or other BS like that, which is a great thing IMO.In my mind, this racing in this game is mostly about trying to screw over your opponents and avoiding danger. You may start to develop a bit of a rivalry with the AI. Nothing feels quite as satisfying as performing a PIT maneuver on JASON WALKER, THAT OVERPOWERED PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ That said, it should be noted that the races are a bit easy to begin with and there's no real way to make it more difficult other than getting to the race/street classes.As well as races there are special 'events' such as bowling, darts and football/soccer. These mostly just involve flinging your driver at high speeds into something. These are extremely entertaining, but good luck winning 1st place!For the most part, the physics feel pretty solid. For some reason the handling feels weird with the chase cameras, so I would recommend using the 1st person or nose camera (if that's what they're called).I use a wired Xbox 360 controller to play this. Unfortunately you have to navigate the menus using the keyboard.The soundtrack is pretty darn good; I'd suggest looking it up. It's nice to have some old favourites to listen to, although it may start to get repetitive after a while.While there are some minor annoyances/issues, this is still my favourite arcade racer ever.

												I had the original Flatout for PS2, and while the 2nd one is better in its racing and derby, I definitely remember while I stopped playing after a while. The first FO had better mini games, even though I don't think they gave you any money/credits for winning like this one does. The controls and physics in the FO2 games and events are way too hard and wonky to ever win unless you spend hours upon hours practicing. The variety of games is nice though, even if the high-jump now has ridiculous new requirements and obstacles in order to actually post a score xPFlatout has always had really random physics. You can run over some fences and cones, but hit a box and suddenly it gets underneath you and you're suddenly facing the wrong way? And everything will turn you the wrong way! I flipped end over end for a good 100 yds, spinning around twice on my trunk, and without fail landed facing the wrong direction. Every single time! The walls and barriers have magnets in them too, so all the metal in the front of your car instantly finds the nearest one and is plastered there - unless heaven forbid you hit the brakes and The racing from 'derby' through the 'racing' class is fun, even though the tracks get old. Once you hit 'street', prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ As the cars get lower, everything will mess you up as it gets under the car - which makes sense. But what doesn't is the seemingly nothingness that will send you spiraling out of control. ""Ohp, you hit a small bump; better not over-correct and face the wrong way!""The street class upgrades are a joke too. 4300cr for .1 handling!? Really?!All in all, a fun game and infinitely better than Flatout 3! Best to only do a little bit of the 'street' class and just max out 'derby' and 'race' to keep the game at max fun - and do demo derbys! You get really adament about smashing your most hated rival, lol.			"

												Here it is, the sequel to a timeless classic, but is it better or worse? Well, a large majority will likely say the former, while looking through a pair of rose-tinted Nostalgia-brand glasses.Me? not so much.There are some big improvements over Flatout 1, but some problems have been made significantly worse. First, lets start with the driving.DRIVING:The driving feels overall pretty solid and nice, arcadey, but not to the extent of say, need for speed. Its sort of a blend of realistic behavor with physics breaking abilities. So far, its pretty good. Front-wheel drive cars tend to understeer into corners, rear-wheel drive tends to slide around more, oversteering, and 4WD is a bit of both, mostly understeer though. All well and good and as it should be. However Sometimes it can be very very unpredictable. Sometimes when landing a jump, your car will smash into the ground, either bouncing into the air or veering to the left or right, causing you to wreck, sometimes your car will completly flip upon landing a jump. THis all depends on the car, but really it can be complete luck weather you land a jump and keep going or crash and have to restart the race, which you will be doing, ALOT.Next, the tracksTRACKS:Oh, dear lord did they mess this one up badly.You know that thing i said in my Flatout 1 review?Originally posted by Spitfiredwod:Some objects are badly placed on tracks, like excavators,trucks,tractors ect all being placed in bad areas, wich can cause unneeded or undeserved wrecks, it also makes it harder to get a good driving line through certain corners. Sometimes even the tinest of objects like cones, can cause huge wrecks too. Yeah, well imagine that, only about ten-thousand times worse.Holy moly did they go overboard on the smashable props! It wouldnt really even be so much of a problem, if said props dissapeared or became uncollideable after being smashed into, but, no.The props just go everywhere, all over the track at critical points before turns or after jumps, and ALL of them will cause you to wreck, every single one, even the cardboard boxes.These props are everywhere, on every track in the game, and they are nearly impossible to avoid.Id say, out of the hundreds of wrecks that ive had in the game so far, 98% of them have not been my fault, 78% is likely due to the props, and at least 20% are due to the bad AI, which we'll get to later.Not to mention, the unbreakable solid objects badly placed on the edges of the track are still here, though, they are usually just boulders instead of trucks or diggers. However they are all pretty much completely hidden by grass, you wont know its there until you've hit one, and half the time you'll be saying ""What the f**k did i just hit?"" as you restart your race for the 17th time in a row, and no, thats not and exaggeration.THE AI:Im just going to be blunt here.This game has the worst AI rubberbanding ive ever seen in a racing game, ive been playing racing games for 12 years, many have had AI rubberbanding, but this one tops them all.To give a little explanation on this, ill use Gran Turismo 1/ Gran Turismo 2 for example, games nutorious for having AI rubberbanding.In GT1 and GT2 The AI would speed up or slow down depending on how much you were beating them, or them beating you. THis is used in an attempt to keep the racing close and fair.If you got 2 seconds a lap ahead, the AI would speed up a bit, usually matching your speed, your able to stay out in front, but if you make a really bad turn or crash, they will catch back up, or pass you. If your in a really fast car, you can outrun the speed boost. The same thing applies if your being beaten, the AI cars slow down by 2 seconds, giving you a chance to catch up, or pass them if you wrecked.Thats essentially what its like here, only its done way, way worse.Instead of your cars being equally matched, In street class, the AI cars will be almost twice as fast as your car, no matter what car it is or if its fully upgraded. The race starts and your left in the dust. then they brake a bit, allowing you to pass, only to smash you to bits or fly right past you once again.Basically, it doesnt matter how good of a driver you are, no amount of perfect driving lines or well timed boosts is going to give you an edge. The AI is basically there to stomp you, and you have to either get out in front and drive nearly perfect to stay there, which due to the AIs speed, wont last long, Or you and try and smash everyone who gets near you to peices. Either way, its racing hell.Finally, the multiplayer.MULTIPLAYER:The multiplayer is where the real fun lies. No garbage AI to ruin your day here, and usually less props get involved, due to  less people smashing into them. (though some are unaviodable and automatic, like the rock slide on Pinegrove.)The game has, or, had real online multiplayer, which was a huge plus over Flatout 1. However in late 2012 rumors that GameSpy, the company responsible for Hosting Flatout 2's online servers, and many many other games , would be shutting down. This would sadly prove true, as on May 31st 2013, Gamespy shut its doors for good, and took all of its servers with it..However, its not all bad, nowadays you can use many different programs to play GameSpy hosted games online, Flatout included. The multiplayer on Flatout 2 is very fun, you can race with, or smash other real players to bits. You can host lobbies with up to 8 players. As a host, you can change what tracks will be raced, what derbies or events will take place, what cars players will be able to use, how many laps a race will have, and so on.  Theres also text, and voice chat in lobbies. Ive never seen anyone using a microphone though, so i cant really answer to the quality of voice chat.OTHER STUFF;The Soundtrack here is pretty great, aside from the 2 Nickelback songs that is. Theres songs from, and not limited to:MegadethPapa RoachFall Out BoyRise AgainstWolfmotherRob ZombieThere havent been any really noticable bugs in what ive seen so far, aside from one minor glitch, where you can drive through a wall on a City track, however the glitch is useless, and wont give you a competitive edge.OVERALL;While i do reccomend this, because it can be quite fun, its also very frustrating at times. Be prepared to restart races 10-15 times to win.7/10.			"

I play it with keyboard and I have no trouble, I tried it with my steering wheel and pedal controller and I need to get more practice with it due to playing with a keyboard. One thing when installing it again, make sure to switch it to WASD unless you like the arrow keys, I keep forgetting to do so when reinstalling the game a few times on other computers. Recommend it to anyone who loves racing dirty and destroying stuff.			"

												A diamond in the rough Flatout 2 is a gem from my childhood, and is a great arcade style racing gamePros- Surprisingly good driving mechanics- Variety of modes- Large selection of cars- Challenging and fun - Ramming into other cars is always fun- destructible environments - NITROUS BOOSTCons- The A.I seem to cheat to get past you when you are ahead of them- Not a huge variety of maps - Some cars in each of the classes just seem way better than others- If you have no money and can't upgrade you're not going anywhereOverall this game was great in my childhood and it is great now, it is a fantastic arcade style racer with pleasant destruction everywhere, basically burnout but demolition derby8/10 it's a steal on sale its definitely worth it			"

It feels amazing to slam into your opponent at high speeds and send them flying, and I dare say that it feels pretty damn good. Overall, stop reading the reviews and buy the damn game already!			"

												FlatOut is one of the many car games but in my opinion its probably one of the best car games ever. It has really good destruction and a really nice Soundtrack. The games was made in 2006 but I still think it has really good ghrapics. I remember first time playing it was when i got my PlayStation 2, about 9 years ago and back then it was the best car game i had played. I still think its one of the best car games but not the best.If my English was bad, then sryGood things about the game.1. Amazing SoundTrack2. Really nice ghrapics desbite being a game that came out in 20063.You can not only destroy you own car, but you can also destroy the other racers cars, ram throug buildings, Gaspumps, Pipelines and much more.4. The game has a decent length to it, its not to long or to shortBad things about the game.Still looking for bad thing about the game? well i cant find any thing there is bad about the game.			"

												FlatOut is one of the many car games but in my opinion its probably one of the best car games ever. It has really good destruction and a really nice Soundtrack. The games was made in 2006 but I still think it has really good ghrapics. I remember first time playing it was when i got my PlayStation 2, about 9 years ago and back then it was the best car game i had played. I still think its one of the best car games but not the best.If my English was bad, then sryGood things about the game.1. Amazing SoundTrack2. Really nice ghrapics desbite being a game that came out in 20063.You can not only destroy you own car, but you can also destroy the other racers cars, ram throug buildings, Gaspumps, Pipelines and much more.4. The game has a decent length to it, its not to long or to shortBad things about the game.Still looking for bad thing about the game? well i cant find any thing there is bad about the game.			"

												FlatOut 2 was one of my childhood games and i still get a lot of kicks and enjoyment out of this game, for it's time the graphics and soundtrack were pretty spot on, the damage is realistic and it's a game that you should buy if you're into racing that is thrown in there with a fair bit of distruction. Not to forget the stunt game modes where you can launch yourself out of a car to achieve stunts. Why not. 10/10			"

												Despite its age and the fact that it was released through crud and rerelease factory Empire Interactive (now defunct), Flatout 2 is arcade-like entertaining, has a kickass hard rock soundtrack and has crash physics that even Polyphony Digital still find hard to implement to their Gran Turismo series. If you want cheap arcade fun with loads of extras, then give Flatout 2 a try, because I did and I don't regret it for one bit!!!			"

												This is one of my childhood favorites. Car handling is great, even on keyboard. AI are not too difficult, they all have a typcal way of racing (read: ""Screw you, Jason. Stop aiming for me, you #?'##^/; ""). The music opened a new world for me there are  nice ways to get Tinnitus. The stunts are a bit hard, but (unlike FO1) there is a tutorial to guide you, and after a couple attempts you get the hang of them. And if you can get a multiplayer game running (on- or offline), it gives you some couple hours more fun.			"

												Far ahead of its time, it still holds up today! One of the best racing games ever, in my opinion. Sure, new racing games HAVE collision mechanics, and carnage... But is that one of their main selling points? Nope.This thing is fun in every way a racing game can be... Well, besides Mario-Kart style weapons. That woulda been neat. Putting a rocket launcher on your broken-down Mini Cooper. But seriously, besides that, which is a matter of OPINION, this game has it all.			"

												FlatOut 2 is now available for many years. It is racing game which handles a good balance between simulation and arcade and players who prefer either of the genres still will admit that it is an excellent fit. The game is playable on multiplayer and has several different types of single player modes. The most important is naturally the career mode. It contains thoughout its progress all other modes in a well mixed compilation.One cannot choose a difficulty, however the game has a very fair difficulty development which never gets unfair, but is mostly challenging. There are three types of car classes. Each has its own event plan and you have to beat all the events of one class to unlock the next one. The cars of every new class are harder to handle since they are getting faster and faster. Within the classes there is a development of the difficulty too because in each class you unlock better cars which raise the difficulty for the above stated reason. You can choose between four car types. There is the light small one with a good acceleration. The big and heavy one favourable for crashing. The normal inbetween which is balanced. The fast type which you usually unlock in each class after a few races. Specially the first three types have have different types of gameplay according to their strengths and weaknesses wherefore you have a different gaming experience in each of them. Each car can be also performance tuned with various parts which you can buy (visually the cars don't change).The career consists of trophies which consist of normal races. But there are also (Destruction) Derbies where your main challenge is to survive as long as possible while crashing other cars and gaining points to win the competition. Moreover the career has every now and then fun events which gameplay bases on launching your driver through the front window in different games which are generally based on different real world sports. You have seven opponents throughout the game which have their own names and portraits and each of them has his own an unique style of driving and usage of car types. The opponents are getting better with further progress in the game as you do. It is also worth to mention that your competitors in the races don't react any different to bots than to you. The tracks you drive on are very various and are always well mixed when compilated in trophies. There are no parts which repeat unnecessarily which is a reason why the gaming experience is till the very end so much fun.Very much in the game is about crashing other cars. You get star ratings for each crash which results in higher income. It is possible to wreck your opponents totally which upmost important in derbies. Also your nitro charges with crashing into opponents as well as into evironmental objects. Specially towards the ending of the game it gets a strategic character to gain nitro. The fun events are often really challenging and if you beat them you still have the urge to beat highscores. But FlatOut 2 is still a racing game. If you don't want to crash you don't have to. This counts for the trophies. In derbies and fun events you obviously have a different main task.Another point that has a huge impact on the gaming experience is the tracklist (music) that is played in the races. It fits perfectly and it emphasizes the characteristics of the game strongly.The best way to play this game is with friends with in local network. You can create tournaments with all the different tracks and events you like and it has because of its competitiveness a similar multiplayer experience like Mario Kart.Since the game is not very expensive anymore and appears often on sales I warmly and highly recommend this game for everyone who is at least slightly interested in racing games.Edit:I've played it again and still not getting tired of it.

												I had this on the ol' PS2, where I felt it was one of the most attractive games on the console, really, and I played it front-to-back, even though it was pretty difficult from time to time (hint: don't be afraid to buy better cars within the same class). As a singleplayer game it's definitely fun enough, with pretty solid gameplay and very satisfying physicsy environmental destruction mayhem, to say nothing of the absolute lunacy of the stadium events... but now take all of that and add in online multiplayer with your friends and you have one of the most balls-to-the-wall incredibly hilarious hyperkinetic vehicular carnage events you could hope for. I mean, let me just throw these words at you: ""schoolbus jousting."" And that's not even including... The Flatmobile. Anyway the driving physics, especially on the dirt road, might take some gettin' used to, but I'd definitely call it worth the ten bucks, especially if you have similarly psychotic friends to play with. Remarkably well optimized for a console port, by the way!			"

												Straight arcade style fun. Played Next Car Game but got tired of the slow updates and other problems so I bought Flatout 2 on a sale since it was made by the same people. Dated, but surprisingly good graphics and great atmosphereCar Physics feel inaccurate and very arcadey, but reward skill and practiceAwesome soundtrackVery balanced vehicle designsRewards destruction without feeling like a gimmickGreat performance, no dropped frames or slowdownsDefinitely worth it if you grew up in the PS2/GCN/Xbox era, this feels like one of those games			"

												This is one of my childhood favorites. Car handling is great, even on keyboard. AI are not too difficult, they all have a typcal way of racing (read: ""Screw you, Jason. Stop aiming for me, you #?'##^/; ""). The music opened a new world for me there are  nice ways to get Tinnitus. The stunts are a bit hard, but (unlike FO1) there is a tutorial to guide you, and after a couple attempts you get the hang of them. And if you can get a multiplayer game running (on- or offline), it gives you some couple hours more fun.			"

												Far ahead of its time, it still holds up today! One of the best racing games ever, in my opinion. Sure, new racing games HAVE collision mechanics, and carnage... But is that one of their main selling points? Nope.This thing is fun in every way a racing game can be... Well, besides Mario-Kart style weapons. That woulda been neat. Putting a rocket launcher on your broken-down Mini Cooper. But seriously, besides that, which is a matter of OPINION, this game has it all.			"

												FlatOut 2 takes me back to the days of playing the scaled-down version on the PSP. It's the same fun game, but with beefed-up graphics and an insanely smooth frame-rate. Like with just about every old game I own, I search for ways to increase the graphics past what's available in the game settings. The game looks great on its own (My goodness.. has it stood the test of time!) but with some added ambient occlusion (HBAO+ via Nvidia Inspector, flag: 0x0000001F) and brute-force anti-aliasing (SGSSAA via Nvidia Inspector, no flag needed), FlatOut 2's age is significantly less noticeable. I'm aware of the better graphics in Ultimate Carnage, but there's something in FlatOut 2's gameplay that I like better. The gameplay feels identical to Head On on the PSP which is what I'm used to. Just one flaw I can think of (not a big one) is the lack of buttons you can map to a gamepad. I used Xpadder to map the last few buttons to my DualShock 4 such as Esc, Enter and arrows keys (to navigate the menu and pause the game). Awesome, fast-paced game. I recommend. Ignore my play time on Steam. I used to play a pirated copy when built my first PC in 2010. I just decided to buy it today because... 2 bucks.EDIT: Idk if this applies for everyone, but for G-Sync users, there is noticeable motion jittering when the frame-rate isn't locked at 50 or at the default limit, 100. Any frame-rate that isn't a steady 50 or steady 100 will make motion look ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Ehh.. most people probably don't notice. I notice, but that's because I'm a smooth gameplay junkie. Wouldn't have G-Sync if I wasn't. xP			"

												In my opinion, one of the best racing games. If you like destruction and vehicle damage in your racing games, this game is a must buy. Also contains many mini games where you launch your driver into goals, nets, swimming pools, rings of fire... also contains figure eights, and destruction derby. I bought the whole flatout set when it was on sale. If it is still on sale when you read this, go buy it. If not, buy it anyway.			"

												FlatOut 2 is a very addicting game from my childhood that I still enjoy to this day.I had this game before I even had my Steam account and I played it every single day.  The demolition derby's were my favorite part, especially using the Flatmobile to take out people.  I beat the career mode a few times also and the soundtrack is amazing.  I still remember the day when I found out that I couldn't play online anymore, it was a sad day.  I had lots of friends that would get on around the same time I would.  It still has multiplayer, but you need a third-party software to run it. If I were you, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  I bought the Flatout complete pack for $6.  It's worth it.  Besides Flatout 3, that game is trash.(Show Sally Taylor no mercy!)			"

												As far as arcade racing games go, I think that since the days when PS2 was a new console that this game has always remaining entertaining for some reason. FlatOut 1 was good, this is great, and FlatOut 3 is absolute garbage. The soft-ish body racing in the game is entertaining, the AI is well balanced, and it's just good fun for spare time casual arcade game racing. It's a shame there hasn't been another game like this lately.			"

												OK, so you'll look at this and go ""wot this pleb only has 5 hours played"" (at the time of review). Well you better strap on a lifejacket nerd because ive got coutless hours on my old PS2 spent on this game. I can honnestly say this is one of my favourite games of all time and possibly the best racing game ever made. So to start the A.I isnt autistic, the tracks are well designed the cars sound beefy, and to finish it... the stunt mode. oh my lordy lord, it has to be the funniest thing in a video about cars. You literally launch a character through a windshield for your own ammusment. Dont think twice just buy it.			"
