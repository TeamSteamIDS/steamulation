												I have wanted a snowmachine game sense SledStorm came out on PlayStation one. This is the best thing to come out sense then for people that want a snow cross game. The game is very arcade and the snowmachines have a generic sound and don't really handle like a real snowmachine but its not bad. It does'int quite have the realism that MX unleashed offered for moto-cross games but It's a good start. Only complaint I have is the price. I fell like $9.99 is a more realistic price for the quailty of game.			"

												Snow Moto Racing Freedom is a really cool and solid arcade racing game much in the style of Aqua Moto Racing Utopia, a game that I like a lot since it reminds me of the old wave race series of games except with more of everything. This game feels very different and in a great way. First, it’s on snow and it gives you the racing options to either sprint cross vast mountain landscapes or to race head-to-head in arenas full of jumps, turns and sometimes high hills to climb. I was impressed to notice that the snow sparkles and that the weather effects range from daylight, sunset, storm, into even dark night where the snowmobiles have their headlights on. The trails that all snowmobiles make stays in the landscapes and are not removed like in other snow games I’ve played. Overall I find the sound quality superb. There are dopler effects as you get passed, the engine pitch goes up when you’re in the air and I even hear the skis in the snow.  The game is rich on features with an extensive single player career mode, time trials, freestyle, leisure, just to mention a few. I think a lot of effort has gone into all the details of the game. And to top it off this game has online play with world rankings. My best advice to beginners:* Try out the first person camera for a great sensation of speed and to gain more direct control on the tight racing tracks.  * In snocross, release the stick early in turns to keep on track.* Don’t be affraid to try different routes in sprint, even if they seem crazy.* Use the boost button to go faster! * Charge your boost by making stunts now and then.* Press the left front lower button to rotate the snowmobile in the air! That’s what I enjoy the most, since this game let’s you fly high in the air in every race. I give it a high score of 9/10 – it’s that good!  "

												I'm from Sweden so I know how big snowmobiling is! The developers Zordix are from far up North in Umeå, and their enthusiasm really shows up in the game.  I discovered this new game after coming back to play 2016 year's surprise hit Aqua Moto Racing Utopia and I'm equally impressed with this one. Looking at some old films on Youtube from earlier popular snowmobile games, my conclusion is that this must be the best game in the snowmobile genre so far. Congratulations on such a great achievement! The physics in this game is really advanced and the snow is well simulated. I love the controls and how the snowmobile slides sideways into each turn on the Snocross tracks. It feels like the level of fun has been turned up one more notch compared to the jetski game. There's more speed and more freedom taking different routes. I guess that's what the subtitle ""Freedom"" means. I noticed many interesting metal music scores which I never get bored listening to. The engine sounds are well done and makes you feel like you're totally there. Especially when switching to first person view. The single player is perfectly tuned with AI that gets harder to beat for every new race. I got some of my friends to play the game with me online. For each race we're collecting points and climbing in the World rankings list. It's quite fun and different to level up in a racing game compared to an RPG. To me it feels like a totally fresh and fun approach in a racing game. I'm now a huge fan of the Moto Racing series and I hope there will be more great games like this coming soon.  "

												We’re at a mountain top. Wind blows up snow in the air and the the two-cylinder smoke lies as a curtain behind the drivers. All equally tense. Everyone looking in the same direction with the same goal. Hearts pounding, nervousness and an enormous adrenaline onslaught. The drivers tightening their grips on the handlebars with their thumb on the gas. That’s how it’s like on the starting line, now let me tell you about the gameplay. Ready-Set-Go! Off we go and all the tension is wiped away. I’m off to a perfect start by timing it and my controller starts to shake as I push the nitro button for extra speed. My snowmobile shakes from the speed boost as I switch to first person view for better immersion. I’m totally there, taking a crazy route noone’s ever taken, far away from the other racers. I barely miss two trees and bounce slightly on a wicked bush. I manage to release the gas, and I slide sideways past two competitors, to line up perfectly in front of the next gate. Slowly up the hill now, trying to make a stunt with the right stick while driving to reload some nitro, slowly towards the goal on the top… curses … I’m passed, not once but twice, and I’m third in the race. If you’re like me, that’s not OK, you’ll want to stay for a long time in this world of snow and speed - to be the best!			"

												Fun little indie game, especially with few options in this genre. High jumping, fast adrenaline, arcade racing game. Ski-Doo Challenge on PS3 is the last snowmobile game that I have played. Its has some similarities to the very few jetski games on the market too, just snow rather than water-waves. It is much more arcade (tricks for boosts) than sim, but lots of events and some nicely designed tracks to unlock. The open point-to-point races are a bit bland though. Day-night-weather cycles make it look nice too and the snow is detailed.The important physics and handling can get sloppy resulting in lots of over-steering on the slim tracks and going all over the place, but with some practice and upgraded snowmobiles that have better handling-grip it gets better. I didn't see any controller adjustments for the sensitive steering. Also, you accellerate very fast, so momentum and proper control is not so important unlike with sims. Those are some areas that could improve. $19 when on sale is decent. Will update as I play more...			"

												I've played racing games for years and this is absolutely one of the best out there that's not got a car or motorcycle in it. It's well optimised which means I've never suffered any stutter or lag whatsoever. If you are a racing enthusiast like me and you don't have this game, you are really missing out. The snowmobiles have excellent physics and feel, the controller set-up is easily customized to suit your style of controller and play. What you are getting here is pure racing, and nothing but. Graphics may not be absolutely cutting edge, but there is certainly not anything lacking visually either that will destract you. The actual game looks and feels much better than the trailer. This is a classic arcade type of game, more than a simulation, and like in all enjoyable racing games there is a learning curve to pass in the beginning. Are you going to jump right into the most powerful snowmobile and dominate the competition? Yes! But only after you've fought your way through loads of challenges to unlock it, and then you'll still have to keep up with the best to win. Do you have what it takes? Let's find out.			"

												It's Mario Kart on snow. Kind of. Great value title. Runs fine on my aging rig, with my xbox 360 controller supported out of the box. PROS:-plenty of championships-easy, intuitive controls (gamepad)-splitscreen mode-online play-playable female characterCONS: -need to unlock championships and snowmobiles-primitive character system			"

												Snow moto racing freedom is a twin stick racing game. Controls are simple with boost, and one button used to trigger handbreak/fast turn/air rotation/reverse, and the use of the right stick is for avatar stunts. Performing stunts will refill the boost, even while you're driving and boosting at the same time, although stunts forces slower turning. Releasing the gas in sharp turns provides more control over movement, and I've used it in conjunction with releasing the left stick - timing is everything. The avatar can lean forward or back with the same left steering stick which affects the whole sled and wheelies are easy to do too. The game is great and supports local multiplayer to crush your friends in.SMRF is worth picking up and playing with friends even if your not a fan of racing games in general.  "

												Its... OK...Its not bad, its not good... if you have a burning desire to race Snow Motorcross then this is for you.  It does nothing bad, its well executed, lots of options, well made... but there is nothing really meaty in this?  Its just Motorbikes on snow... that actually sounds really cool, but in execution its just a little... meh.MY GAMEPLAY:


YouTube™ Video: Snow Moto Racing Freedom - Someone say yellow Snowcone? 

			Views: 126		

			Story - ""Snow Moto Racing Freedom lets you take your rightful place on a high-speed snowmobile on Snocross tracks or through vast beautiful winter landscapes.		

But 22 bucks for this game??  Well for that price I could buy 1000s of games in this genre and many much better.  So like I said, if you love the snow mobile racer thing, then this is right up your street.  But if you are just a casual user maybe looking for a racer or something different, I wouldnt touch this at its current price of 22 bucks... wait for suimmer sales or continue your search.Happy Gaming People :D			"

												Let's have a look at Snow moto racing freedom, the latest Moto racing game that has come out. It seems this game is very different from the others in the Moto racing series, since it's a snowmobile game and there are huge landscapes of snow to plow around in. You get to race in three parts of the world, all good looking enviroments with a huge amount of different racing tracks and cross-country checkpoint tours. There are tons of unlockable snowmobiles of different capabilities that are really fast and fun to drive. I can recommend switching to the first person camera to get the ultimate speed sensation. This is really fast hard core racing on snow. Snowmobile fans out there will love this game, this fantastic game is for you. THE GREAT+ Serious racing+ Great snow simulation + Beautiful mountainside environments+ Lots of tracks+ Lots of snowmobiles+ Polished gameplay+ Great sound effects+ Heavy soundtrack+ Online world rankingTHE LESS GREAT- No online leaderboards (yet?) - Only 14 Achievements (yet?)THE FUTURE- Some expansions and DLC would be great. (?)			"

												The game is undeniably fun, but lacking customization, polish, and has certain features that don’t feel fleshed out or complete. It’s certainly a fine game to pick up and play a few races in with friends, but the tracks quickly become repetitive and boring. There are plenty of other racing games out there at the same price point that pack more content, better graphics, and tighter gameplay, but for gaming enthusiasts who absolutely must race snowmobiles, this one is worth picking up, on sale… Or you could go download the ROM for Arctic Thunder, your choice.Full Review: https://www.gizorama.com/2017/computer/pc/dreaming-of-arctic-thunder-snow-moto-racing-freedom-review "
