												The top-rated helpful review compares this game positively to 3D shmups like Star Fox and urges the reader to purchase this game immediately if they enjoy the others. Don't do that.Since the comparison to Star Fox has already been made, I'm going to roll with it. We're going to be focusing on the similarities and differences between this game and Star Fox 64, which might seem unfair once I get into it, but 64 is eighteen years old and this game came out this year.First off, the flying. Your ship (no matter which one you select,) has no real weight to it. It floats gleefully around the screen with such speed that it highlights more especially than anything the stirring lack of actual control you have over it and the lack of any real animation to it. The ship floats where you point it and that's it. No maneuvering, no complexity of control, and no real animation to the motion besides a slight tilt in the direction you're heading.Okay, the flying's not great, but 3D shmups are more about the shooting anyway. Star Fox 64 had satisfyingly fast shooting with incrimental power upgrades for your lasers. This game SORT OF has a similar upgrade, but it is automatically collected - no challenge there - and only serves to slightly speed up your INCREDIBLY SLOW AND INACCURATE SHOOTING. Your shots don't arc based on motion or follow the angle of your ship, they go forward on a fixed line, meaning you need to line up perfectly with your enemy to shoot them. This would be a small flaw if your ship didn't block most of the screen and make actually seeing and lining up with an enemy an incredibly difficult effort that ultimately only serves to crash your ship into the target and not actually give any meaningful award or feedback for shooting the target down.The screen is locked exactly as it is, so your range of motion is incredibly limited. This wouldn't be an issue considering the complete LACK OF DIFFICULTY for most of the game, but sooner rather than later, enemies and their attacks start tracking you. With the screen locked as it is and your ship as floaty and unresponsive as it is, you very quickly start losing life to attacks you've got almost no chance of escaping. This is what we call ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY. It's when a stupidly easy game makes a stupid and hamfisted attempt to make itself not so stupidly easy.There's little to no variety in the levels. Honestly, the major difference between one level and the next is what enemy or threat you're meant to be shooting or avoiding. There's briefly an in-door segment with metal walls to avoid, but it's not contextualized as a huge enemy ship or planet or base or anything, and once it's done you're back to the completely linear space hallway.The visual style is incredibly lazy. Nothing looks interesting or memorable in any way, and the utter lack of animation beyond direct motion kills any sort of interest the bland designs and lazy attacks might generate.I'd like to say there's something positive to this game to help redeem it or maybe make it more aggrieving that the rest is so lazy and boring, but there isn't.I can't put in the effort to be mad at a game that didn't have any effort put into at all.TL;DR Slow, boring, lazy, ugly, and uninpsired. No matter what other games you enjoy, pass this one up. It's not worth your time, let alone your money.0/10 (NOT WORTH RATING)			"

												Here we have another game that can be summed up in a single word: YIKES!It's cute that Sun Blast's store description not only has the gall to claim that it was inspired by Star Fox, Space Harrier, and Panzer Dragoon, but it also says that it's ""the best 3d space shooter on Steam"".Sun Blast was inspired by a dumpster fire. Never before have I played a shooter with such poor mechanics, sluggish controls, and awful mission-design. Dodging enemy ships and their bullets should be a relatively simple task, but instead it's messy and somewhat convoluted. This can be attributed to the odd perspective. It's not always clear where objects are in relation to the player-ship. So this results in lots of collisions. The bosses tend to have homing weapons, and they're exceedingly frustrating to deal with. Why? Because the player-ship can't maneuver around them, and the angle makes it difficult to tell where the homing shots are heading.In shootemups, dodging a single bullet should be as easy as breathing. The developer makes the game more difficult by increasing the speed of that bullet, adding more of them, giving them unique properties, and so on. It's the constantly building intensity that keeps these games challenging. Sun Blast somehow manages to accomplish the opposite. Dodging a single bullet is far more trouble than in any other game I've played. The missions are exceedingly generic and dull. For the most part they're also extremely easy, except for the bosses. Whenever I had to replay the last few stages, because I died at the boss, all I could do was nod my head and think ""Yep. I expected this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.""  If I spend enough time with Sun Blast, eventually I could learn to handle it's many terrible qualities. But why? This game suffers from a total dearth of entertainment value. Before I forget, let's take a look at this statement: ""the best 3d space shooter on Steam"". I can't claim to know the Steam Store's library well enough to confirm that this is false. However, I will point out that Space Harrier II is available on the service. While it hasn't aged well, and the frame-rate is worse than Sun Blast's, this relic from the 16-bit era is a much better game. I suppose it doesn't include enough ""3D"" or ""space"" to fit the criteria, but it might actually be worth your time.			"

If it is on sale and is very cheap I'd say give it a go since it usually goes for like 19p on sale.			"

												At £0.19, this game is worth it. I would in no way recommend buying at £4.I've not played a lot of this game, but I don't really need to: it is a slightly clunky but perfectly playable game. It's the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a bargin bin, but along side the original Virtua Fighter or Pac-Man: Good but dated. Which is funny, because this isn't an old game, it just isn't very complicated.Comparisons against classics of the genre are overly generous, but fans of the genre looking for a cheap & cheerful time-filler will enjoy this game's flatter-by-mimicry content. It even has unlockable 'challenges', which is a nice touch! Add to that the fact that this game will probably run on a toaster and what you have is a nice little offering. "

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!Do you like 3D shmups reminiscent of Star Fox? If your answer is yes, then hit the buy button and have fun.Everybody else, read on:Gameplay is robust and gets the job well done, movement is highly responsive and can be tweaked to the players preference by selecting from various ships to control. Furthermore there is even an auto-fire option.The levels are split into 3 categories:1. Shoot as many enemies as you can while trying to not get hit. After downing several you will recieve upgrades to your weapon as well as a shield (final upgrade, can take 1 hit unpunished). Obviously by getting hit the current upgrade will be lost.2. Survival which is basically all about dodging stuff.3. Boss battle.Additionally challenges will be unlocked by progressing through the main campaign.			"

Old school 3D graphics with the ability to move both horizontally side to side and vertically as well.  The game is pretty fun with different levels each changing up the targets and obstacles on screen, everything from asteriods to big spiked indesuctible metal balls to enemy ships.Pros: - Acceptable 3D old school sprite style graphics- Movement is responsive and fast paced- Dodging the oncoming asteroids and ships is actually fun- Blowing stuff up, despite the lackluster explosions is satisfying- levels change it up each time you advance, so you're always doing something a little different from the last levelCons:- No 360 twin stick controller support (at the time of this review but a developer has said such support is planned)- No score to be seen while playing the levels (Even though it adds up your score at the end of each level, the score could still be kept during the gameplay, and an assessment of the score at the level end could be done and then player could recieve a bonus is applicable)- No real power ups or ability to ""skill up"" your ship to move faster, shoot faster etc that I saw- defeating enemies and blowing up asteroids is wayyy too basic and lackluster.  Big explosions would be very nice in a game like this, especially in the year 2015, not seeing more satisfying explosions is disappointingOverall, this game is easily worth it's asking price of $3.99 USD and certainly it's sale price.  While you likely won't be spending dozens of hours in this game, if you get an hour or two of fun out of it total over the next month or two, then it's more then worth the price tag.  Advice: I would wait until the support is added for a twin stick controller (Xbox 360 controller support) especially if you enjoy playing games like this with a controller over a keyboard.My Rating:  65% out of 100 (But this rating is moved up to a 75% considering its low price tag) "

-Quick Review-Sun Blast is a 3d-ish, space shooter-ish, developed by OBLONE Software and released April 2, 2015. In Sun Blast you move up down left or right while shooting and dodging.

-Detailed breakdown review-Warning: This is going to be a salty review. That being said, who knows... maybe you'll like this game more then I did. Maybe Sun Blast will capture your heart...

Gameplay: I don't want to compare this game to star fox because Star fox is a game I actually enjoyed playing, whereas I did not enjoy Sun Blast at all. I would discourage anyone to attempt to play this game with a keyboard, and recommend you turn on auto fire (so you can spam fire while auto firing).Lets just examine each ""feature"" on the store front:1) Full gamepad supportYes, they even have wii motion controls, for any of you on steam whom have a wiimote.2) Three ship designs to choose from, each with unique look and behaviorOne ship moves right and left a tiny bit faster the then others and up and down slower, one moves up and down a tiny bit faster and left and right slower, and the third moves up and down at a medium pace (so it's not strong in one area and weak in the other)I didn't notice a difference between the ships in any real significant way.3) Fight against stealthy fighters and gigantic starshipsAre there stealthy fighters? Yes, there are about 2 types of star ship fighters, and 3 different types of starship ""bosses"".4) Huge level selection, from planet orbits to underground tunnels to infested military basesThis is the one I have the problem with. There are only about 4 or 5 different types of levels: Survival levels, shoot down a number of ships levels, dodge and break apart rocks levels, timed levels, any mix of the aforementioned levels... and boss levels.THEN, they reskin the pretty background, and have you do the same levels over, changing the ships on the level, and changing the ""NPC"" or ""target"" density.In a game like starfox dynamic events would take place, even if you were playing more of a rain shooter at certin points of the game, you'd need to shoot an enemy chasing after a friendly, sometimes a friendly would save you... There's nothing which changes from level to level. It's either: shooting to get enough kills, or dodging to get through a mine field.5) Replay levels to earn medalsThose are the challenges, and they  relate to:6) Steam achievements and leaderboardsMost people will get this game exclusively for the steam trading cards, for the sake of trading card mills. which... I mean, if that's your goal of this game, you'll get your money's worth, but my review relates to the game itself.In other words the most redeeming qualities for Sun Blast is: wiimote support, the music is good at first but then gets repetitive, and steam trading cards.

Conclusion: Now comes my softening statements of remorse... I've clearly explained why I dislike this game... The problem: someone worked on this game. It's not pretty, it's not fun. But it's cheap, you get trading cards, and at least it's a little different.The problem is there's no real motivation to keep playing, and I don't feel like when I die it was really my fault and could have been avoidable. I use Super Meat Boy as my go-to for samples of ""difficult, but fair"". It could extend to any number of classic Arcade-styled video games, like Pacman or Galaga.If the only way to get all the achievements and to be GOOD at Sun Blast is to learn the levels like someone would learn Pacman or Galaga, then I guess I'll need to disappoint the creator because I'm not going to put that amount of time into a game like that.Like I said at the start of this review, some people might be interested in trying this game out, and some people might like it; that's okay, I'm glad you enjoy the games you like, but I will be taking my time and playing something else.Thanks for reading my Review.

												It is a small space shooter (...as in you shoot in space, not that you shoot spaces) with simple 3D graphics and a 3rd person ""behind the spacecraft"" view. The game controls using exclusively the keyboard with the arrows or the WASD keys and space or ctrl for shooting. The gameplay consists of series of levels where you have a single goal which is one of shooting enemies down, avoiding obstacles, shooting a specified number of enemies in a given time limit or taking down a big boss. When you are supposed to shoot down enemies you also get powerups, but those persist only in the level (as does your health, which resets after each level).Generally speaking, it isn't anything special to write home about, but it is a good ""time waster"" - especially considering the price. Personally i also really liked the background music.On the negative side, i'd say that the game becomes repetitive after a while (so it is only good for short bursts between other games or for your lunch break at work). Also i am not fan of saving only every few levels because of said repetition.			"

												Did you played that space ship game on old Nokia? Well, this is it, just in 3D. No brain, no strategy, just keep firing and dodge what survived.  If you happen to like that kind of games you'll probably enjoy this one.Graphics & music is simple, but nice to look at and music sounds great, for first minute.Now problems :)- Keybinds are fixed, because ♥♥♥♥ you.- Gamepad binds are fixed, because ♥♥♥♥ you again.- That great sounding music is 30s loop. What. The. ♥♥♥♥.- And if you are still not ♥♥♥♥ed enough, draw distance is hideous.I mean, seriously, draw distance is about four lengths of ship. Stuff just fades from darkness right in front of you. Imagine playing that old Nokia game, with right half of display broken. That's this game. Did I asked what the ♥♥♥♥ already?If at least 2 of those 4 problems can be fixed, this can be good game. Not best thing in the world, but good enough to play through. Especially for that 0.3€ pricetag. RIght now, it's just not good idea, at least in my opinion.			"

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Sun Blast with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.       Sun Blast was presented to me in one sentence as “like Starfox 64”. Prior to even redeeming the key I found this an unfair way to represent a new game because Starfox (in my opinion) is the best of the best for that third person arcade shootem’up genre. Putting expectations at that level means that a fully competent title could easily be harshly critiqued or condemned for not being absolutely perfect.       Fortunately, this is not the case for Sun Blast; it is anything but competent. Right from the start the controller mapping is atrocious. O(PS4)/B(360) is NOT the select button, it is the back button. Period. To be fair, that’s nothing a quick remapping would resolve right? Wrong. Attempting to open the remapping section of the options menu hard crashes the game. Every. Single. Time.       At that point I figured I might as well try out the actual game to see if troubleshooting would be worth the effort. Spoiler: it wasn’t. The ship you pilot is MONSTROUS; at any given moment over a fifth of your screen is obstructed by it. Shooting can hardly be called that, when you fire the only feedback is a pitiful streak of blue moving awkwardly towards the center of the screen. And yes I mean the center; the depth of the playing field is so janky that it is almost nauseating trying to figure out where your ship is relative to the debris you’re attempting to shoot or avoid. Not a good experience at all.			"

Enemies are uninteresting. Soundtrack is overall meh. Also why must I continue from right after the last boss fight if I die on a level before the next boss/at the next boss rather then just restarting on that level.

												Disclosure: Received review copyA Wii game that hits late the PC scene and one that tries to sell itself as a Starfox, Space Harrier type of flying game.  Wii roots can be seen right away on the loading screen where the player is recommended to keep the wrist strap on at all time. Now just how many play this with a remote like on the Wii? So is it any good? Well yes with some caveats:Pro's:+ Pricing+ Simple gameplay - Pick it up and off you go.  There is even an autofire so you dont need to mash fire button. + Challenge. Simple to learn but achievement stats speak for themselves: Those gold medals are tough. + Content and variation. Yes it's listed below as a Con too but considering the base idea this game tries to get everything out of the formula with excellent variation and details.  Sometimes you fly in space shooting things, sometimes you either fly in space or in a tunnel and try to avoid hitting things. And lets not forget the Boss fights. Con's: - Limited content in the end no matter what. This is one of those small games you pick and play and then put away. Forget about tens of hours of gameplay. - Truly casual gamers with no will or skill to advance further will hit a wall relatively quick. Difficulty ramps up quite fast.  "

												Sun Blast bills itself as a game inspired by Star Fox. Having played it, I would say it more accurately reminds me of an arcade game with a Star Fox feel to it. You have the choice of three ships to play as and each level consists of different types of enemies or obstacles. Survive an Asteroid bombardment, defeat fleets of enemy ships, collect upgrades to your ship, and go head to head with a mothership. I think the game is fun for an arcade-style game. I would have liked to see a little more variety, but visually it looks pretty good for an arcade-style game.			"

												Got it for $0.49. It's on sale until Feb. 6 2017, so if you think it looks like it's any good pick it up before then. It's a very simple game, with only flight and shoot controls. A hommage to the games of old. It's not as good as the classics, but in their absence it is enjoyable. Yes, I could easily hook up the old consoles to the TV... Or I could skip running wires on my day off, and play this on PC. All in all, it was worth what I paid for it. You can't get much for under a dollar these days, apart from small quantities of bulk food at the supermarket. I assume they're banking on a ton of people spending 50 cents for the game. In any case I enjoyed what I got, even though it felt somewhat limited. Worth all 50 pennies I paid for it.			"

												On rare occasions Steam's bargain bin can provide some suprise gems, ""Aeon Command"" and ""Revolution Ace"" two examples of fun games that have delivered much more value than the few coppers I paid for them. Sun Blast is NOT one of them. Sure, it's only 79p full price..... often going down to under 20p when on sale..... I think I paid only 19p for it..... but I only played two games, lasting about 6 minutes in total before thinking ""what a pile of ♥♥♥♥♥"" and uninstalled it.Your ship sluggishly roams the screen shooting streams of oncoming obstacles..... as you have to put yourself right in their paths to shoot them, they often just crash right into you anyway. That's all folks, nothing more to see here..... level after level after boring level. You've seen it, done it, got the T-shirt even after 10 seconds play time.The three different ships types have NO obvious actual differences between them.The powerups you often get appear to do nothing at all.The store page is misleading, and makes many hyperbole comments such as ""Wow! Wow! WOOOW! Best best BEST 3D space ♥♥♥♥ on all of Steam ever ever EVER!""..... FO!The many positive ""fanboi"" or ""developer planted stooge"" reviews are also packs of lies.Don't be fooled!Crap, just crap.Revolution Ace is just 22p at moment..... go and get that instead!Just one thing left, all fanbois and developer bribed stooges, hit the ""was this review helpful?

												Sun Blast. Is it like Star fox? Kind of. It actually reminds me a bit more of a ship flying level in the Tonka Space station game I played as a kid. For this, it gives me nostalgia which is good. That being said, I don't know that this game is for everyone. IT is very nostalgic for people who played other similar games in the past, but others might want to pass. -PR0XIDIAN			"

												★★★★★ Yes this is one you don't want to miss. And only playing this for less than fifteen minutes, is just how quickly you can become hooked on trying to complete that one- more -level cliche'. The graphics are crisp, music is good ,the sounds are great, and the control with an Xbox 360 controller is faultless as I can tell. You can select one of three spaceships at the beginning and it just depends on how you like your ship to respond in space. As you fly through space you destroy asteroids for power ups and generally try and avoid getting crushed to death. It  is a good one.			"

A forward flying 3d shmup.Pick 1 of 3 ships to fight, dodge, and destroy.As you play you can grab laser upgrades that will upgrade it upto 4 times but if you get hit it'll be downgraded.Levels consist of 4 missions like destroy X of Y, or survive the time limit, then you'll fight a boss.There is a save after each boss fight but you can not change ships unless you start over.The level up to the 3rd boss has a difficulty spike.Shoot the enemies at a distance and just avoid them if they get in close (they will chase you a bit).

												Remember those side scrolling, or top view shooting games with space ships? This is what you get, but in 3D. You shoot enemies, get power ups which make your shots stronger, but on each hit you lose one power up. Sounds rewarding and fun you say? Well, here comes the thing that makes a man turn into a very mad man: every 2nd round is a survival round, shooting won't help you and there are no power ups to get - and you will have to avoid obstacles at quite high speed, often you can't see what is coming next, so you better have a very good guess up your sleeves, or you will lose most of your power ups, ending up with your lame standard shot for the next round. Enemies will be fast later and they will shoot, and they will hit you, over and over and over again. Then comes the boss and you have your 3rd weapon upgrade ready! Let's wreak some havoc hee.... wtf... the boss just shot a homing projectile at you, which you can't avoid if you weren't at a good position when he shot, and another one, and another one... enjoy beating the boss with your standard shot (which is pretty lame) :>This could easily have been a fun R-Type style 3D game, i will not dare to name a certain star animals title here, this would be too blasphemic.

												Gets hard for all the wrong reasons The draw distance is horribly bad this is a pc game why can i only see objects when im so close to them i barely have any time to react and not crash into them?. this is a PC GAME not a wiiware game this draw distance is unacceptable and only makes this game difficult for all the wrong reasons it's like downgrading graphics of a pc game and trying to make the difficulty interesting by doing that and all it does for me is makes me believe this game is a failure.and it being a pc game only makes me feel that alot more with this abomination of a draw distance for seeing objects the gameplay is not that bad but the game gets hard because of a crappy draw distance not because of the level design which would have been a better way of creating difficulty like i dunno STAR FOX.did i mention this game was inspired by games that are way less barebones than this game? yes this game is basically flying through space doing different things for each space part with no cities or anything in between(at least as far as i made it).heck even space harrier another game that this game claims to be inspired by has a better draw distance.me personally i wouldint have bought this game if i would have demoed it first but that is a choice you get to make so i won't say buy or don't buy that is up to you me personally though im not satisfied with this game at all......

												If you enjoy Aegis Wing, then you will probably like this game as well.Resembles Aegis wings, but from a third person perspective in 3d instead of 2d side scrolling.Seems aimed more for a younger audience, but can be enjoyed by adults as well.Had some minor issues like passing through some objects, and shots not always doing damage.Having said that the gameplay for the most part is solid. graphics are colorful, and the soundtrack is pretty good.Great little space shooter you can get for your kids, and enjoy yourself from time to time.Especially when you consider the low price of Free.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												This game is a pretty middle-of-the-road, if entertaining (in an arcade rail-shooter kind of way) third-person space shooter.    I do think the comparisons to Starfox, Panzer Dragoon etc. are just a bit hyperbolic - the game is really only superficially similar to these well-regarded classics. It is ultimately more like a third-person Galaga/Asteroids clones with a few Starfox elements like the tunnel level etc. The graphics and sound are fine, if not technically/artistically impressive, and the controls of the various pilotable spacecraft are very responsive using a X-Box 360 controller. There are several different level types, from needing to destroy a certain number of objects/enemies before the timer runs out, surviving an onslaught of obstacles for a certain amount of time to navigating tunnels, and these tend to repeat with the odd boss-battle ad-nauseum. As I've not invested very much time in the game at this time, I can't comment on later levels.All in all, it's not a bad little arcadey game for 24 cents (the price I paid during a sale), and I've certainly dropped a quarter into far worse arcade machines for a single play, but I would say that it's definitely a harder sell at above $1 or so. At the right price, it's a simple little arcade game that scratches that certain itch in small bursts, but it's not something I can see myself investing a lot of time in.			"

												This is an awesome game. It has no real depth but that's irrelevant. It's fast and addictive. It looks good as well and it's extremely smooth even with my old gtx 460 :P. It was a spontaneous buy and I don't regret it. The only thing that bugged me in the beginning was that it doesn't support simple usb gamepads which you can plug into your usb port. But I could solve that problem by downloading JoyToKey 3.7.4 (try a google search for ""JoyToKey English Version.htm"" and you will find an old version that didn't cost money back then).With the gamepad it's a joy to play.

												It's an alright space shooter game. The atmosphere and 3d space backdrop is really nice and the game runs smooth. The levels are kinda dull and repetitive though, but the music is cool. The survival levels are kind of a pain. Keyboard controls aren't that bad once you get use to them, if you get use to them. I kept auto-fire on for the most part because I used the WSAD, so hitting control all the time would kill my pinky finger.			"

												Ok, so this game has a few flaw, but overall it is an enjoyable experience. I myself am a huge fan of the shmup genre, with Starfox (the original for SNES, not 64) being the first game I ever played to completion, and this game definitely deserves a spot on the shelf with other shmups. Let's get right into it, shall we?Pros: - MUSIC! This game has some of the most up-beat, driving, and overall motivating music I've heard in an indie shmup for a while - Variation: This game doesn't just ask you to shoot everything. It requires you to master all forms of gameplay presented.  - Well paced. This game doesn't have a difficulty wall. It gradually eases you into the harder and harder levels. And even as the levels progress, it is preparing you for what's to come.Cons: - Control... No matter your ship, you control like you're flying a blimp - Graphics: The graphics are lacking a bit. I gather that this is an indie game, but everything looks a bit too flat and uninspired. There's no real art direction other than ""Standard space shmup.""I rather enjoy this game and can see myself playing it quite a bit in the future. That said, it's not the best game I've ever played. There is certainly better, but for $2, I'm not going to complain.			"

There is a timer in the top right corner that tells you how much longer you have to dodge stuff.If you have played strike suit zero, its the last level of strike suit zero.The controls work fine if you have a wii controller or some other controller, otherwise, this game can be played using the directional keys alone or wasd.Overall, its an okay game.

												The game is pretty nice. it is not bullet hell like most of the games on steam lately, but a 3d space shooter. It does feel a little like star fox in the way you control your ships. The graphics are good enough to appeal to the player. Bullet effects are not the best, but you can see the differences when you upgrade your weapon and hear different soudns for each upgrade as well.Controls are pretty crisp and spot on, the game has a ncie difficulty, you don't know what to expect with each new enemy type and they can catch you off guard as they all have different ways of flying at you or attacking you. The game also has some levels where all you need to do is fly through small spaces or through space debris and dodge objects, so a good mix of different levels.I fought one boss battle up to now and it was a good challenge and fun. I think its a nice game to own if you are a fan of stuff like space harrier or starfox, they captured some of the magic those games had and put it into an indie package at a small price. I recommend it to fans of 3d space shooters. "

												Game with that old classic feel but with better graphics. Was able to get all the way to the final boss but I just couldn't beat the dam thing and its just so frustrating. Especially when you die, you go all the way back to first level you did after you beat a level, if your just starting then I assume you go back to level 1 if you died to the first boss. Theres 4 levels before getting to that final guy and part of the reason I'm mad at the dam thing is because that giant bar going across the top of the screen that shows your buffs, it gets in the way whenever the final boss fired something at me from behind it and I wouldn't know so I couldn't dodge it half the time. Besides that little annoyance, fun game.			"

												Got this game even though the store page said the reviews were ""mixed"" for this game. The game was on sale for 19 cents and has steam trading cards, so for that price I couldn't resist. The game is very fun. It is basically an on-rails arcade shooter, that starts off really easy but quickly ramps up in difficulty when you get to the boss battles. I was stuck on one of the boss battles but felt really good after I finally beat the level. The music is great and although I think its the same 2 or 3 tracks, It dosen't become annoying. There are pickups on the levels that make it easier to blast enemies, like a faster gun and a shield. The graphics are pretty bad for a game released in 2015. To be honest it looks like a PS2 game and for some reason the game Is locked at 45 fps. Also, when you first launch the game and try to run it in 1920x1080 you'll notice that the screen is cut off. However, if you go to the folder where the game is installed, there is a tool that will fix the problem.  My biggest gripe with the game would be the User Interface and Presentation. There is no real indication of how far along you are in the campaign. When you beat a level it just tales you to the next one. There's no screen that says how many more levels there are. Also there is no way to easily change to another ship, (the game lets you choose from 3 at the beginning of your campaign). These problems however do not negate the fact that the core game at hand is very fun. At full price I don't know if I would feel like I got a value.  There is only about 2-4 hours of gameplay, but for 19 cents I cant complain.			"

												Kind of hard to play on a keyboard, everything seems clumped up on one hand.Can't rig up a basic controller as the 'controller detection' doesn't work and there's no way to force any alternate controller options without passing the controller detection test. You'd figure controller support would be a no brainer here, especially since it comes with ""Full Controller Support"" which is obviously, a big fat lie. This feels like a controller game...Some options that appear to trigger a popup, don't, resulting in ALT+F4 and try again.Graphics aren't exactly great...Gameplays pretty simple, shoot things and don't get hit, seems to be about it.Better space games out there, save your dosh.

												Truthfully for a $1.00 or better $0.25 this game is worth it!Visuals are decent even if not truely great.  While controls and animate effects could be better.  It is still a worthwile buy for casual fun.I give it 3.5 stars out of 5For the low reasonable price I say buy it!  Its good for a casual distraction and can be fun from time to time.			"

												Sun Blast: Star Fighter, mostly known as just Sun Blast according to the own application name and name on your Steam Library is a third person Shoot-Em-Up Bullet Hell game that seems to be inspired by Star Fox. It's a fun game for you to play for a while specially for the price it has. There isn't much to say, since this game could've been something much better, but it's good anyway. If they ever look up to this and make a better version with better graphics and gameplay, i can consider buying it too to review it again. This isn't really a game that you can review, you know?6.5/10 ~You can do better than this. "

												A very frustrating game experience.1. Graphics of a game made in 2000.2. You cant' really tell where you're shooting, there is no aiming whatsoever. You literally just move around hoping nothing will hit you.3. Many times powerups go at the speed of incoming enemies, behind one, so you won't be able to catch them.4. No save, except on checkpoints.5. Poor level design. E.g. in survive levels you can only loose powerups, which the next level on purpose requires.Just save the money and get Saints Row the 4th, and you get this game as a minigame, with far better graphics, story and gameplay.

												I'm a big fan of Starfox, so this looked like a solid buy, but the only reason I'm not asking for a refund is that it cost me $0.24. It just isn't even worth bothering with it. This game feels like it was made with one of those pre-loaded engines that design a very simple game for you with a few clicks of a button and the enemies, ships and the environments all look like something that if I google'd hard enough, I'm almost positive I'd find the clipart somewhere.Controls are awful, firing accuracy is dreadful. Enemies don't even do anything, they just fly straight at you. You also take damage alot from enemies you avoided just because of how poorly this game is made. As someone else said, it's only hard because it's cheaply made. I intend to review every game I own, good or bad and I cannot give this any kind of redemption. It's just cheap and weak. There's a reason the creator isn't asking for any real money but even with how low the price is, it isn't worth it. Pass on this, it won't remind you of Star Fox at all.			"

												Well this is a flawless masterpie.. no. Maybe I expected it to be much more like Star Fox, and this was the main reason why I bought this game. Even If this game tries to be like Star Fox, it isn't enough to be fun and faaar away to compete with such titles. The stages are annoying, there is always something like: kill 20 enemies to proceed to the next level. Really? That's all?No. The fact that you're constantly framed by the screen without the possibility to fly a little bit arround is annoying as well. But the part I hated the most is how the enemies spawn randomly on the screen and give you barely time to shoot them. The only thing that is pretty ""decent"" are the boss fights and how the bosses actually are designed. Would I recommend this game? I wouldn't.			"

												This may have been a good Wii game, but if fails to take advantage of it's new platform. A generic shoot em up that doesn't play well in terms of difficulty/climatic level design (if you're doing the same thing the entire level....you're doing it wrong.) and the implemened controls don't make that much sense given the perspective when another one which was much more reasonable.

												A friend of mine sent me this game so I had to try it out for myself. Even though this game is ok to play through, the whole tunnel shooter gets dull by the time you get to Level 12. This game does have good music and this game can be improved if there was a speed option like Star Fox or if all of the stages weren't just tunnel shooter stages. The game would also be better if you didn't lose powerups when you get hit. Epic Quest Games..you did do a good job and I can commend that..but because it gets so dull later on...I cannot give this a thumbs up			"

												This is not like Star Fox! After buying this game, I was looking forward to what I thought was the PC's answer to Star Fox. I also didn't see a proper sequel to the Star Fox series coming anytime soon. I doubt that Star Fox Zero (the upcoming one for the Wii U; not sure if that's the exact title) will offer much either.Suffice it to say, I was very disappointed in this. But I suppose there are a few pros. Here's the breakdown:PROS+ Cool textures for the price (I payed $0.24 for it instead of the original $5 price)+ Music is okay and works for the gameCONS- Levels are generic and repetitive. Environments are quite static. I had to double check this page to see if it was EA (Early Access), but it wasn't, and to be fair, even in EA, games usually have more to them. The space levels are the most generic; you either have a static background and a ""starfield"" whose simplistic particles keep coming towards you monotonously, or you have a planet under you that appears to be a scrolling surface. In short, this is an inferior Star Fox that borrows from its worst parts.- Graphics settings are minimal, consisting only of resolution and a fullscreen toggle.- Checkpoints are thrown at you at the end of boss fights that seem to occur every 4 levels, and you only have 1 life, so if you die during the boss fight, you have to repeat those 4 levels, which is frustrating when you beat some of the more challenging levels.- Powerups don't seem to change anything except for the appearance of your ammo being fired. The purple stuff in your final weapon upgrade wiggles left and right in its trajectory which may slightly increase the radius making it more likely to collide with enemy hitboxes, but not enough to be worth the effort. If you get enough powerups without getting hit too much, you get a shield, but I can't remember if it absorbs 1 damage before collapsing or if it even does that much.- No option to use the mouse to move the ship or to even remap keybindings.CONCLUSIONDon't waste your time, energy, or money on this. It's not worth it. There are far better FREE games out there. I am going to ask for a refund (it sounds like a lot of trouble for $0.24, but they shouldn't be able to profit from this). This game is one way to pass the time, but I know of a better way, go play Solitaire! Sun Blast is not nearly as fun as Star Fox, so don't be fooled.			"

												Music's alright.  That's about it.  Collision detection is DREADFUL.  No such thing as a near miss in this game.  Patterns are random, yet predictable, and all based on the current ship location.  Could be a great game if it were diversified a bit more, and collision detection detected actual collisions, instead of slamming into thin air.  I gave it an hour, and was annoyed the whole time.  This game is NOTHING like Starfox, Starfox rewarded skill, and had a lot of variety in the levels, and felt like doing more than just flying through a tunnel where the empty space around an object is just as hazardous as the object itself.  I hope I can still get a refund for this crap.			"

												Dont buy this game for more than a dollar. If you're expecting a fun space adventure like starfox or at least a fun shoot 'em up adventure like Panzer Dragoon, you're going to be dissapointed. This game is functional, yes. It plays fine. However, its got bare minimum functionality. You shoot and move through space, occasionally getting power-ups. Don't ask what they do, the game doesnt tell you. How do you use them? You dont. They're auto applied to your ship and you lose them when you get hit. Your ship (whichever of the three you chose, it wont really matter. They control slightly differently, but its not a major change) is always at the front of the screen and the camera scrolls you forward. enemies/obstacles pop up (and I mean pop up, its like it was made on the n64 the popup is so bad) so you can never tell where they're going to be. The field of view is incredibly small. There is a real lack of any substance. Yeah, you're in space shooting stuff, but it lacks all the things that made games like starfox coolYou dont see those squadrons of enemies approaching, battling in the background. Sometimes you're lucky if you get a planet background instead of black emptiness with the hyperspeed lines from starwars to indicate you're moving fast.Boss battles arent anything special either. No cinematics, no sense of danger, no challenge. They just feel like regular enemies with health meters. Also, there is no story in game. The game gives you about 0 feedback on anything that is going on. So, read up on the lore before playing, otherwise you'll be lost fighting the most uninspired aliens I've ever seen. I think I played for 15 minutes. I dont think I'll pick it back up any time soon. Not really worth my play time, and chances are its not worth yours. Its actually a port of a Wii ware game from 2009. So, dont expect anything of it at all. At 24 cents, I feel like I barely got what I payed for. There are flash games with more content.			"

												Get out of this game..! This game is too much HARD and it isn't a game to spend time for practice, because it isn't worth! But MAYBE it's worth 0.24€.. maybe			"

												its an okay game. its more ""Giant Clank"" sections from ""ratchet and clank: size matters"", then starfox.then again, i got this for 49 cents. also, this is better the luch truck tycoon so, thats a plus.			"

												This game amazes me with 3D graphics and very beautiful particle effects.However if you go to bottom left corner and keep tapping space you will eventually win the whole game.Even the developers are embarassed of making this because I couldn't find credits in the game.			"

												Lazy and boring. All you do is dodge things while shooting things that fly towards you. Some levels you don't need to shoot, you just dodge. What a horribly boring game, I could only stand it for 18 minutes, I played one game until I died, and then wrote this review, then uninstalled it.			"

												This game has charming looks, it amazes me how well polished the ui and graphics are, no they are not last week triple A graphics, but they have an oldschool feel without being broken and ugly like many indie games. having said that , but the gameplay is just not there, its very dull to play on the pc and pretty much uneventful - I think it may be a little more interesting with the wii controller... To be fair , I paid a few cents for this, it was well worth it so i can't downrate this, if you are about experimenting with  different games I'd say it  is well worth spending a couple bucks - this is actually well made much different from most of the green lit penny grabbers - but if you are hopping to spend days playing this you will be frustrated			"

												This game is a complete timepass. If you're bored and just wanna play some game quickly then this should be your first choice. A nice time killer.

												Sun Blast........ i guess you can say it's not broken at least. Not a bad game, but not too great.... what's the word I'm looking for? besides repeatative I mean (which honestly it is). I did have fun with it for about 20 minutes, so i guess it's not bad if you wanna waste time for sure :) so yeah i guess if you put it that way it's recommended. If i need to give this a score out of 5 though, I'd give it a 3/5			"

												It stands with it's own feet as a casual game, and for a game of the genre, you're probably looking for that.You know that game that you play for 10 minutes while your dota match is searching? That is your game.			"

												This is probably best described as a sort of ""Star Fox"" clone.  There were a lot of games like this in the 80s and 90s for PC, and this one doesn't seem to have improved on the formula.  If you absolutely love the idea of flying a space ship forward down a 3D hallway and shooting ships for power ups this might well be the game for you.  It's not a bad game, but I personally wasn't entertained for long.			"
