YouTube™ Video: CAN THIS GAME TEACH YOU TO DRIVE? (City Car Driving)

			Famous driving school simulator City Car Driving is now on Steam! Driving test gameplay! Subscribe for MORE! » Twitter: http://twitter.com/figureight » Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/figureightt...		

Firstly, this might be new to Steam, but it's an old game (First made 2007). I definitely don't feel it's dated THAT much though. It's not at the levels of ETS2 / ATS in terms of graphics or immersiveness, but there is still a lot of game here.The city you drive on is a fictional Russian city, so whilst it offers modes to drive with US laws, EU laws, Australian laws and Russian laws, the city still looks and feels completely Russian or at least Eastern European. Australian laws offers the ability to drive on the left but again, this city still feels Russian and feels designed for driving on the right. I'd recommend EU or Russian law driving.The game is playable with keyboard but you're not getting the full effect until you use a wheel like the G27. It has clutch control and H shifter control, so becomes a lot more intuitive using it this way. It apparently can work with controllers but I can't get mine to work. I've seen videos of it working though but can't speak on that.Career mode does have some things to do, all based around the idea of testing you on driving manouvers and experiencing different situations in driving, but looking through what's on offer I can't help but think there should be more things to do. .Graphics and performance wise, it's really not that bad. You can tell that gameplay is placed first before graphics but it's definitely not terrible to look at. Uses a lot of higher res textures, and lighting is pretty good. Performance is actually great running GTX670 and 4770K. Definitely seems optimized for modern machines despite it's age. Overall I think this is a great game. I'm an experienced driver but I still enjoy it purely because it's a change from the norm in terms of car driving games as it doesn't have a focus on racing. It can be somewhat therapeutic driving around, just like in the same way you'd enjoy a game like Euro Truck Sim.			"

												Played 5 hours in my first sitting and love it. I'm going to have my usual nightmares about difficulty driving each night I play this. I can feel it coming. A bit of background: I don't drive in real life. At least not at the time of this writing. I'm a normal human being, but I don't feel confident about my driving skill. This game really puts me to the test. Though it's not 100% matching the types of roads that I'm familiar with in Canada, its the closest compared to all the other games I've tried. I'm glad City Car Driving has finally made its way to Steam.If you thought you could be a good driver with Project Cars or Euro Truck Sim 2, this game will prove you wrong if you weren't already a driver. Be mindful that some rules or road systems may slightly differ from your local roads.This game is very strict on everything and is totally on the ball with telling you your mistakes or giving you a warnings to keep safety in mind. I sometimes complain about games that give you alerts too late, or leave old alerts on the screen that confuse you, but this game only tells you the now and happening. The only thing it's probably missing is a replay function for you to review what you did wrong. Otherwise this game is very much a learning tool. Most driving games don't punish you and take you off the road to restart like this does. The last time I played anything this strict on driving was from a Dreamcast game called ""Tokyo Bus Guide"" - which I played with a wheel as well.My experience with the game is by steering with the Logitech G27 and using TrackIR for headtracking. The G27 required keybinding, but its quite straight forward. TrackIR works flawlessly without having to do any setup. I've only borrowed an Oculus Rift before, but being able to see persepective with this game though a Head Mounted Display would definately be a huge plus as well.Even though the game is from 2007, you'll quickly forget about its graphics and keep your eyes on the road. I think the graphics are quite satisfactory for a car simulator though. The car interior is well done and the world outside blends together just fine. The traffic experience is terrific and weather effects, though not HDR ultra realistic, really do their job well.I'll be sinking a lot of hours into this. Hopefully it will encourage me to try taking my driving test in real life again.			"

												A very well-done driving simulator comes to Steam! While there are several other notable driving simulators such as BeamNG.drive, American Truck Simulator, and ETS2, no other simulator quite simulates driving a car in a city with realistically unpredictable traffic.Pros-Fun driving sim-Realistic traffic flow.-You can change the agressiveness and density of traffic in Free Drive (hint: Agressiveness 100% + Density 100% = California metropolitan driving simulator)-There are no licensed cars but they are easily recognized (but debadged) cars.-Engine startup, seatbelt, parking brake, and shifting simulation-Career mode with driving school type campaign-Almost-constant feedback on your driving in Career or Free Drive mode if you are not a perfect driver (such as ""You are driving more than 5 mph over the speed limit"" or ""You did not use your left turn signal when changing lanes"")Cons-The graphics are so-so-Police cars just drive around like civilan cars and do nothing else-You can hit other cars as many times as you want with ONLY visual damage (although you cannot do this in Career mode)-A hassle to install mods, you have to copy and paste a couple folders to the CCD folder from a .rar file then have to convert outdated player_cars code to the new code by hand and this can take a few minutes per mod.-Very poorly optimized; in the time it takes to load up a Free Drive you can get your homework done or eat your lunch. This game will punish you if you try to exit while it is loading. Other games will crash if you close them while loading, but this one will turn the screen black indefinitely until you force your PC off by means of cutting the power. Also at times it can lag badly (causing you to crash the car) and the sound can be heard looping. In fact, the loading times are so horrific that I noticed little improvement when I moved CCD to a solid-state drive.The Pros outweigh the Cons somewhat, and this simulator is well worth the $24.99. It's great for driving enthusiasts and also great for those starting to drive in real life soon.			"

IntroductionCity Card Driving is developed by Forward Development Ltd. and published by Forward Global Group Ltd. It is their first project on Steam and they show great promise, considering that more than half of the simulators on Steam are subpar in terms of both overall quality and in the purposed simulation itself. GameplayCCD is fortunately a great simulator and one that doesn’t bore its players either. Featuring both an open-ended type of free driving around its sizeable maps and a career mode, you’ll have enough time to drive and learn as you progress from different models of small cars and even SUVs or a truck. While the car chassis might look indeed familiar, the game has no official brand licensing. You will still be able to recognize them by their form factor: BMW, Mercedes, Peugeot, Fiat, Toyota and of course (since the game’s Russian made) more than a few Soviet designs mixed in the crowds of contemporary vehicles. Afterall, this wouldn’t be a modern urban Russian setting without several G-Class/Brabus moddifed black SUVs roaming along some Lada Nova/Riva. So much for the class struggle. I did appreciate that apart from the far too many and gloomy apartment blocks, you also have maps with modern steel & glass buildings which add both flavor and enough visual variety. The weather effects are nicely simulated as well, along with potholes and mud. Truly, the only aspect that is rather overlooked it seems, is the damage effect and appearance. I do suspect that the dev team didn’t focus a lot on this since as long as you obey the traffic laws, you shouldn’t have to be concerned about getting hit or hitting something/someone with you car. Speaking of the legislation, when creating a profile before delving into the career mode, you can choose between the traffic laws (and right-hand/left-hand driving side) of the United States, European Union, Russian Federation or Australia. Naturaly, I stuck with EU and right-hand driving since that’s the precise legislation I must obey in real life. Left-hand driving is odd to me, but I might give it a try eventually. It’s not like the UK, Commonwealth and several Asian countries will give up and join the rest of the world nations into a singular and standardized method of driving, is it? The traffic AI seems to speed up and drive quite aggressively but I suspect this has something to do when passing 60 frames per second. Vsync doesn’t fix this unless you manually override the option from you GPU chipset’s dedicated software. Unlocking all the cars within CCD will be quite difficult since it has an in-game achievement system that can be unforgiving at times. I was pleased to see that there seems to be a hefty mod support for the game which can only mean new cars, even more detailed than the “vanilla” ones. Where would PC gaming be without modders? The graphics are more than decent for 2016, with vehicles receiving the most attention, as far as textures are concerned. The buildings and pedestrians could have used more variation but even as they are now, I’m not complaining. Wish I could say the same of CCD’s sounds or the instructor’s voice. Basically there are very few in-game sounds and the voicework isn’t that good. I wasn’t expecting music even if all the simulated cars have stereos, but the title feels very silent apart from the engine sounds and turn signals when activated. At least you can cycle between several camera modes such as top-down or free camera with the help of the right mouse button. In terms of rebinding the controls to suit your needs and preferances, City Car Driving is among the best simulators I’ve played recently, no doubt. Pros+ Pleasant graphical details+ Complex simulation of traffic laws from several continents+ Virtual Reality support Cons- Sometimes erratic AI behaviour- Limited sound selection- No Steam Trading Cards or AchievementsResult / Final thoughtsAs a collector of simulations found on the Steam Store and knowing beforehand exactly how bad some of these games can be, I was truly surprised by City Car Driving’s element of fun, its attention to details and of course the by the book enforced, traffic legislation. While it may not provide the much needed experience new drivers require (nothing will ever replace actually driving a car in real life), it should be regarded as an auxiliary part of the whole learning process. I can only hope that this dev team shall consider adding an expansion or even an entirely new title focusing on motorcycles.Rating 80/100 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill.

												Had it since 2011 and havent stopped playing.Yep, that is right. I have had this game since 2011 and it never gets boring thanks to many modders.I use a G27 which adds to the fun.The game is improving heavily with each update. I have been making my own mods this year and the friendly forum users use them with joy and are always motivating me to do better.The game is just spectacular.			"

This is not a gameIt's a tool to learn how to drive properly. Graphics and sound are just fine, the driving in a living city is the real experience.Controls are hard to setup, every profile defaults to keyboard bindings. You need to rebind them every time you make a new profile UNLESS, you copy the profile from an already made one... TIP... keep one profile always configured as default.This is great, the new update just added this:Oculus Rift CV1 owners can easily use their headsets and plunge into the reality of the virtual city streets. Also we started working closely on support for HTC Vive. For mods fans - now you can easily upload custom cars in the Steam Workshop and install them in just one mouse click. And there is a hatchback added already as an example. So, we are waiting for your high-quality models!			"

												This is not another racing title. This is a teaching aid. From starting the car to buckling the seatbelt to reverse parallel parking to merges and lane changes, you will be prompted to follow the rules. You will learn all of the car's functions which vary from car to car. Manual Transmission vs Automatic transmission is one example of variations and the differences you will experience. There is the ability to drive on the left or right side depending on which option you choose. I find that ineresting as I have never driven in a places where they drive on the opposite side that I am used to driving on. The working streetlights with working AI makes the intersections realistic. That realism goes for the traffic jams too. I could not believe I was really stuck in virtual traffic. If You are looking to race, drift or do anything that would impress a stuntman, this is not for You. They made a seperate version of this for just that type of fun. If You have not yet passed your driving test, this is for You. If You are looking help someone get familiar with a regular car but do not want that car to be Yours, this is for You. If your last ticket cost more than this simulator, this is for You. If You just want to drive just to drive, this is for You too.			"

												If you're the type of person that gets bored on GTAV and decide to drive around and obey the traffic law, then this game is perfect for you. To make this game even better it has a workshop so you can drive expensive Ferrari, Mercedes, Audi, BMW, etc. in snowy weather in the middle of Russia. It allows you to adjust how much traffic and civilian you want in the game along with how drunk and wreckless you want them to be.10/10 totally worth the $18 on steam sale			"

 City Car Driving DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the gameCity Car Driving is a car driving simulator that; as the name suggests, takes place in a city. There are many different titles in the driving simulator genre, though this one in particular plays more like an educator rather than an actual game. You learn to navigate through a city that has laws and road interactions and even locations that mimic real life. The game also has vehicles that are similar to actual automobiles, though may have their names changed to avoid any copyright issues. Although the game is played with a mouse and keyboard, it also has steering wheel and Oculus support for those who want a more authentic play. -------- Graphics: 6 / 10 The game's visual assets are decent. Reading street signs and being about to identify roads, buildings and other cars are extremely important for a simulation title such a this one. The graphics aren't amazing but they do get the job done. There is quite a selection of vehicles to choose from within the game, including; light trucks, mini-vans, off-road vehicles, pick-ups, and even mini cars. All with their own visualizations and sounds. The only complaint I'd have about the graphics are that the car movements seem to feel a bit too smooth. This may ruin the immersion for some. Experiencing different terrains and driving conditions that affect the car physically (aside from bumping into objects) would bring another level of engagement to the game. The game's physics are pretty good, and even though the graphics are very basic, the cities in which you drive in are actually quite interesting, visually. When there are collisions within the game, there is visible damage to the objects and vehicles. The game seems to run fine on a mid to high tier set up, though integrated graphic cards, may suffer a bit while trying to run the title. -------- Sound: 6 / 10 The sound effects are exactly what you would expect from this sort of title. Very standard car and city noises. Again, it's nothing special but it gets the jobs done. These sound effects are similar to the ones you'd hear in real life. There doesn't seem to be any in-game radio or anything like that though it's not that important. -------- Mechanics: 8 / 10 The mechanics of this simulator are very well done. It has everything from buckling up your seat belt to traffic lights going out of service. In addition to the main driving  mechanics (which are very competent), the game also allows the player modify driving conditions, such as; weather, time of day, amount of traffic and even the amount of other ""dangerous"" drivers on the road. While driving, you may also encounter pedestrians that choose to run across the road at inconvenient times, or even other drivers coming down the oncoming lane. Similar to actual driving, the player must be alert at all times. Like most driving simulators, traffic will behave in a realistic fashion. You can even modify the rules of the road to match a certain country's  traffic laws. The game also gives you the option to change which side of the automobile you drive on. The career mode of the game lays out challenges for the player. It gives you a scenario with different conditions you must overcome while driving. These challenges get progressively more difficult as each is completed. The free-drive mode will allow the player to drive about a city as they please while still trying to maintain the rules of the road.  Final Personal Remarks: The game is very detailed when it comes to driving mechanics, and is good tool to help others learn to drive. At the very least, the game gives you a good amount of theory knowledge for driving. Despite all this, I don't think I'd recommend it based on it's enjoyment value. I know there are a lot of people who DO enjoy simulators and would appreciate something like this. However, these types of simulators don't engage me enough to consider them ""fun"". I do think it's worth checking out though based on how educational it can be. The game also has a fair bit of mod support as well as frequent updates which can add to the value of the game. Thanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.			"

												City Car Driving is a very robust driving simulator with a ton of real-world scenarios and situations that will help you deal with a large amount of situations in real life driving. A large focus of this game is definitely learning, but they managed to make learning very fun.One of the things that really helps it stand out to other games especially in it's teaching of things like defensive driving is the AI. You can't predict how other drivers/pedestrians are going to act which might seem a bit basic or dull, but when it's  combined with the nice car handling and some nice scenarios, it's definitely one of the things that adds depth to the experience and tons of replayability.Another thing that shouldn't go without notice is the notification system. It notifies you on absolutely everything you're doing wrong in real-time. An absolute necessity for some of the more complex scenarios where you can kind of get lost in your errors if you're not careful.The career mode is where you'll most likely pour most of your time into on this game, it's where you do everything from practicing basic maneuvers to attempting to drive through insane weather on a timer. Although those things are nice, I do think there should be some more complex tasks, but mastering the current tasks has been enough challenge for me so far.For what i've read to be an older game, the graphics are really nice and although i'm only just over the minimum system requirements by a bit, I can still run the game with well over 60 fps on high settings. While the graphics are nice, they obvious aren't the focus of this game.Overall this game is definitely worth a look. I don't play many driving games and for that reason don't own anything like a digital steering wheel, but even without one I can still see myself spending many more hours in this game just trying to get all my tasks up to three stars. This game is great for both experienceddrivers and someone who barely drives at all, there is a lot to be learned and a lot of fun to be had.			"

												City Car Driving is the best car driving simulator on Steam. Period. All other driving sims are poorly done or racing games. If you would like to accurately simulate driving a real car in the city, this is your game. That isn't to say it isn't fun. The game adds a challenging career mode that even the best of drivers cannot complete with three stars in every level. The mods, available on the Steam Workshop and the official game forum add cars that we can recognize from the real world. If you know where to look, paid cars (sort of like DLC) by modders can even be found. I've been playing City Car Driving for over three years, and seeing the critical reception on Steam is wonderful. City Car Driving is not meant to be a racing simulator. It is single-handedly the only viable option on Steam for a city driving simulator. The physics of the cars, driving wise, are very good. Those of us with steering wheels can hook them up to the game. The clutch simulation is very good too. I've learned to drive a manual transmission because of City Car Driving. I drove around with my Logitech G27 in a manual, and second try in real life, I sucessfully drove a manual transmission car. The game also provides a wide array of different driving scenarios. The career had driving test esque scenes, taxi driving scenes, fuel conserving, traffic, and professional driving. The ""Free Driving"" mode had summer/spring, fall and winter modes. The winter mode even had ice, which is a very nice touch. The ice is fun for the drifters in all of us, and to learn to drive in a snowy climate. The ""Records"" mode is a great way to watch yourself do anything from racing in traffic to seeing your mistakes. This game is far from graphically obsolete. The models are easily recognizable, and you can tell what you're supposed to be doing, as well as the basic readings from the gauges. The graphics are perfectly fine for a simulator. If it was a triple-a title, it would need all of the bells and whistles of today's most impressive graphics engine, but for a driving simulator, I find the graphics to be perfect. The broad range of cars from soviet-era sedans, to modern Russian sedans, to the most bought car in the world (Toyota Corolla), to the two right-hand drive Holden and Ford options, the French made Peugeot, the small transport truck, the soviet minibus, and the Russian SUV allows for anybody's driving style to be accomidated for. If you are lazy like me, there are even programs on the game's forum inside the ""Tutorials"" section where you can unlock everything with the click of a button. This game is something that any car guy (or girl) should have a look into. It is a great simulator, and provides a wide array of interesting scenarios that keep the game lively and interesting for hours.			"

												I first got this when it wasn't on Steam, when it just came out, the game was good, it came a long way with all the updates and the amazing modders kept it alive with the sick cars. Since it came out it turned into a different game, and the Steam version only helps it with it's self installing mods no need to do all the BS with downloading from the forums and installing with NotePad++ into the games code or using a installer, the Steam WorkShop is what this game needed and other good things came with it like the FPS counter, and steam overlay.I would recommend this game to anyone who's into cars because it's great and even better with a racing wheel (currently using the Logitech G27 with a custom shiftnob).It's nice on Foward Developent's part that they made the game free for whoever had and/or played the older version/Non Steam version.

												So I just found out that even though I bought the game prior to it being on steam all I had to do was go through a one click system and boom I have the steam code for the game it was wonderful and easy to do. 10/10 more publishers need to learn how to do this rather than forcing you to re-purchase the game!

												First off, words can not describe how excited and happy I was when I saw that this game was finally released on Steam!I had seen game videos on Youtube for this game, and knew that this was the game for me.So, after buying it on Steam and playing for some time, I released that this game has a ton of potential.First off, City Car Driving is not necessarily a game!It is meant more as a driver's education type learning tool.(Although, I bought it as a game, and continue to play it as a game) :DCity Car Driving is one of the very few games that has the following features:Parking BrakeSeatbeltsTurn SignalsHornStop Lights and SignsPolice Officers to Direct TrafficSmart AI that can be changed to more aggressiveWindshield WipersAnd almost everything else that can be seen in the real worldAlso, this game can even run on my PC with no problems!I have a Dell Inspiron 3520 with 8GB of ram, and HD4000 512MB Video Card, and an i5 processorAfter changing some video settings to medium-low, I have no problem running the game.Another awesome thing is mods.You can choose almost any car you could think of to drive.Now, you used to have to check all kinds of websites that weren't even in your language to find the mod you were looking for, but now, all you have to so is download them from the Steam Workshop! Now, to some very few negatives:First off, I was very dissapointed to see that this game does not support Xbox 360 controllers.I am in no financial state to buy a wheel, so the controller is vital for me.This is my most major problem, and I hope the developers fix it soon, as I am not the only person with this problem.Also, it would be nice if there was tire smoke and tracks.Next, this is more of a suggestion, but a working fuel system would be cool. :DThat's about it!If you are looking for a super realistic driving simulator, look no further!This is the one for you!P.S.I bought it during Steam's Winter Sale for $18.24.

												City Car Driving is not a game, it is a driving simulator to help you to aquire driving reflex and train your knowledge with road lessons. This is clearly not a game.In that role, it is very good and complete. You have a career campaign, to train you with objectives like park your car, drive by night, with rain, etc... You have also a free and open driving mode, in which you can configure the map, the conditions, car, etc... Conditions are very complete, with weather, people behavior, presence of road works, policemen, etc...I wish one day, people can develop maps for different towns. But you can choose between European or American road system.I strongly recommend it if you need to have some training of car driving at home, with at least a wheel.			"

												This simulator is one of the best driving games i have seen, even rivaling games like Euro truck simulator 2 for driving.The missions are good for helping you understand the basics of driving.My only complaint about this game is the region settings.In this game you can select different regions to base the road laws off of, like American, European Australian etc, and on the Australian setting the map selection you get is less than the others and very few cars are right hand drive, but appart from this you can still have fun in this game.

												The game is great and realistic, a one of a kind game. However, if you do not own a steering wheel, i would either recommend buying one, or not buying the game. I say this only because you dont get the full potential of the game. Plus it makes the simulator more easy, and also makes it more fun. At first i tried it with a keyboard and mouse, and it was very difficult to play, ended up purchasing a steering wheel and pedals for my PC just for this game.			"

												I like this game. it is more a dribing lesson simulator then an arcade game but it does everythign right. I won't recommend it tho for people who are only using the keyboard because it is pretty hard to steer. it is not as amooth as in ETS2 or ATS or even Construction Simulator 15. It is more similar to Bus Simulator 16. By the way, it is running better then Bus Simulator 16 graphically speaking and I had no lag. And it looks even better.it is worth the koney to have it in your simulator's collection			"

												The game is great although it doesn't have the latest in graphics - but for me that's not a big issue. The game excels in the realistic gameplay, and does so pretty well. Add the modding community and -possibilities gives one hours of endless fun. When driving with keyboard and mouse, it does get boring after a while, even with the mods in my opinion, however when using a steering wheel it's good fun for many hours. If you're about to take your driving license, this might even be a good learning tool, especially if you have a racing wheel and H-shifter available. Setting up my wheel (Thrustmaster's T500 RS) wasn't too difficult, however the different sliders are kind of hard to get just perfect. Setting up my H-shifter (the TH8 RS) was very easy though, just button mapping. The game supports TrackIR (also using FaceTrackNoIR) which is a very nice feature for those having the ability to use it, it makes it ten times easier to pan the camera compared to using the mouse.I've seen multiple people have issues with the downloaded mods from the Steam Workshop, I've had issues too, as the mods do not (at least for me) auto-install. It takes a bit of unzipping, folder moving and file editing to get the mods to work properly, it could've been much easier, yes, but there is a how-to guide on the CCD forums and once you know how to, it's not such a big pain. I've had only one issue with the mod cars once installed, and that was the ""ABS bug"", where the ABS tick box was greyed out, this however is solvable by following instructions also available on the CCD forums, and it doesn't appear again once all cars are installed as per those instructions.For the right person, this is a 10/10 game, but that will not be everybody. I recommend this game to those into simulation games, ETS2/ATS, OMSI and the like, who also has a racing wheel. If you do not have a racing wheel, I sadly doubt you'll find as much fun in this game.			"

												With the Oculus Rift, I like this a lot. Though it isn't really a 'game', it's more of a simulator. The driving lessons aren't always very clear about what exactly you need to be doing and for some reason I can't get into the parallel parking excersize without it telling me I stopped. Vocal instructions would have been a lot more useful.The sounds of the engines could be a little better, but the driving is cool and work well with my steering wheel and pedals. The cars on the workshop look great and you can really feel a difference between one car or another. It's  a little weird that there isn't any one command that let's you recenter the driving position so that you don't have to adjust your position everytime you get into a different car.All in all, this is nice as a sim, not great as a challenging game but cool in VR			"

												I have been playing this game since 2012, although i bought it today on Steam.This game is really good but has a few problems. The biggest problem is the Steering sensitivity and the confusing controls.The steering is over sensitive, and if i set the deadzone a little high, the steering does not function properly, for example if i turn 10% in my steering, in the game it will turn 30%.Graphics are okay and the loading time is terrible and i have no idea why. Euro Truck Simulator 2 loads faster actually.I would rate this game 4/10.Please fix the sensitivity. "

												Long story short, the game is a real life simulator of driving a car.What amazes me is the fact that little things in the game you would expect in driving IRL activities such as a pedestrian walking accross the road randomly.The game works best with a steering wheel as I have a Logitech G29, Pedals & 6 Speed H-Shifter, which is an amazing Steering wheel and is no delay between the wheel itself and the game. It works perfect!10/10. "

												Things i like about this game:During the hirst hour playing, the game appeared to me as boring and annoying. But, after about an hour i started to manage using the turnsignals, shifting gears, holding the speedlimits and following the trafficrules. even though i don*t have an steering wheel the game is now pretty entertaining. I am going to get a wheel, gearbox and pedals soon and i believe this is going to change the experience alot and make it even more joyful to play this good game. The menu is not to exciting, but it is very well made and systemised.Things i do not like about this game:Over all it is a pretty grat game, but there are some negatives. sometimes, other cars stop in the middle of a waycrossing and force you to slow down to like 3 mph/ stop yourself. Than you get a notification that you cant stop in a waycrossing. I have had some problems with the game not wanting to launch. several. times. This is very annoying cause i had to delete and download the game like 4 times. I believe this is caused by the cars i downloaded from the workshop. DO NOT DOWNLOAD CARS! If you already have messed up your game you can fix it by deleting the mods, deleting the game, deleting the folder called ""forward development"" on your computer and reinstalling your game. This worked for me and everyone else i've read about on the internet so far.What can be done better:Well over all, the traffic rules are good and the graphics are ok. Maybe you could have made it more real life-like by adding stuff like taxes and that you actually have to pay when you crash. Maybe the police could stop you if you drive too fast or something. I would also like more and bigger maps. Maby a bigger highway where you can drive alot faster. After all i love the game and want to recomend it to everyone who wants to learn to drive or just want to have fun driving. I look forward to see this game evolve in future updates. (-:			"

												Wow! From reading the negative reviews I wasnt too sure if I should bye this game or not. But I was write, it ran very well on my PC which isnt bad but isnt Incedible. I was stuck at settings up my wheel but worked out I had to hold down my pedals and wheel to set it up. The Steam workshop fro this game is alos very and good and i like how they use real life cars ingame which can recognise but just wihtout the logo. Overall if you want a good driving sim and you feel it may not run on your PC I would still give it ago but make sure if your unsure not to stay on it for more than 2 mores or not do anything about it for 14 days or you wont get a refund!

												First of all, this is more of a simulator than a game. So if you expected something like forza or gta, look somewhere else. This game, like beamng, is an amazing simulator with great driving physics. There are lots of mods available and the VR support is great, although it'd be nice to be able to view the menu in VR as well. It has a career mode where you can learn the ins and outs of the game, as well as a free driving mode where you can do whatever you desire. The performance is great and the graphics are ok for a game released years ago. Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a realistic driving experience.			"

												I had this game a long time ago when I just got my Logitech G27. My friend used to come over to play and we had a blast driving like morons. So I figured I had to get this for steam and wow it has been updated, nice to see devs being active like this. And It has a workshop too which is even more awesome :DPros:-Realistic AI-Nice driving physics-Good sense of speed-Awesome weather and seasons-Challenging little career missionsCons:-Slow loading times-Not the best graphics out there but that's no biggieI give it an 8/10			"

												The game is suitable for practicing driving in everyday traffic. Do not wait races. This is more of a driving school where you immediately notify your mistakes. Great game in this category. Great. I recommend. I purchased on the website of the manufacturer, before the release on Steam.Positives: + great simulator driving in traffic+ good graphics+ low hardware requirements+ easy addition new cars to the Steam WorkshopNegatives:- worse sounds cars			"

												The game definetely has room for improvment.Then again it is an amazing simulator.My pc is not lets say the best at running games. It runs at 20fps on the lowest settings. However from the many hours that i have played this game, it definetely resembles a driving simulator.For those who are looking at a more racing style competitve game this is not the one for. If  you do enjoy simulators then yes this is the game for you.Some annoying points are the price. I think that it is slightly over priced over priced. Its a good game, only downside is the price.

												The first thing that caught my attention is the audio. Very primative. The engine sound must have been copied from an Atari gamebox. The graphics are just OK. Everything is clear and easy to read, but not a lot of detail. That's probabely OK, as it's not going to overwork your GPU. I'd like to see a module to calibrate the controls. My G27 is a little touchy when making turns. No where near the precision that can be had in iRacing. Overall, it's rather intertaining, and for the price I'd recommend it. It's a really good game for people to show off what the Rift can do.Update:I discovered after using this several hours, that this version is not really fully ready for VR.  On screen messages and instructions are not displayed in the Rift, and the speedometer is only shown in kilometers per hour. The developer says a fix is coming, but the way it stands now, it's not really ready for the Rift.I am backing off my comment about the graphics. The graphics are actually very good. The audio, however, still sucks big time.			"

												This looked good and got some good revues  so thought I would buy. My initial reaction is there is no Xbox 360 gamepad capability which I thought would be pretty standard these days. I tried the game with just the keyboard , Keyboard and mosue and joystick. Playing by joystick didnt work and playing keyboard makes it all very erratic. Unless something changes with the controls setting to allow me to use a gamepad then this could prove to be a bad purchase.I cant recommend this game if you like me depend on a gamepad			"

												There's currently no controller support. The only thing you could use to control the car is the keyboard, which is pretty flimsy by the way.The driving itself is okay, but not as realistic as racing games like rFactor or Gran Turismo.The optimization is not that good for a game that looks like a 2009 Unity game. The loading times are even longer than Sonic '06!I still reccomend playing this game; just wait for a sale.			"

												Hello, I just bought this game today but I can't seem to make it work with my G27 Wheel and Pedals. When I plug in my the wheel it starts to spin and sycronize like it usually does. When I calibrate my wheel and pedals in Windows they clearly work, I can steer, gas and brake without a problem. However when I start my game up everything seems to work but when I get into the first-person mode in the car my wheel ''locks'' itself and I can barely rotate in any of the directions. Also no other components of my racing gear work, so basically I can't do anything in-game.Do you have any solution for this?Thanks and have a good day!			"

												Warning!! If you get motion sickness don't play this game. With or without VR the game's movement is quickly nauseating inducing. I could only last a few minutes before I started sweating and getting sick. The head movement is badly done. The VR is nice but again find another game if you are susceptible to motion sickness.Another thing about this game. If you don't have a wheel the control setup on this game is esoteric and confusing. I never saw a bunch of more confusing setup commands for a game in my life. I tried to set up my Xbox controller and spent far to long playing around with what worked and didn't work. Get a damn clue in making this thing easier to set up simple driving controls.			"

												When i first saw this game I was quite excited! i love a good car simulation game. I bought it, downloaded it and launched the game. i was met with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and terrible controls. the game in general is just too clunky and hard to play.NOTE: I REFUNDED THE GAME AFTER 20 MINS!

												Asked if the game was compatible with x-box controller ... was told if i want to use a x-box controller i am not a pc user from the developper directly...Also high price for poor engine, poor graphics,  and unclear instructions in a lot of places... Here is the copy paste of the developper :City Car Driving Developers [developer] 5 Nov @ 2:43am The software is made for the PC. We recommend to increase the realism of the steering wheel and VR.Adapting to xBox, PlayStation and other similar controllers are planned. We sympathize with users who can not use the PC. But we can not change it.Update :Better Developper response, and got the refund from steam. When they update and fix the issue, i might retrieve the negative review, but the game will stay a no buy .			"

												DO NOT BUY.This game/simulation is terrible.  Way overly complicated keyboard controls for simply zero reason other than to frustrate.Automatic clutch?  But no automatic transmission?  WHAT!?Looks like it has controller/joy/wheel support but controller doesn't work at all.  Simply does nothing.			"

												I have played this game before it was on steam and have always enjoyed it very much. As someone who uses a wheel/pedals/shifter setup it is one of the games I enjoy the most.

												I think this could be better for me if I could get the g29 steering to work, when I go into the controls and select the left option and then turn my wheel it doesnt register, the wheel is brand new and has the Logitech gaming software installed and works fine with Project Cars etc, other buttons appear to work fine other than turning left and right. Not sure what is wrong with it.			"

												Works well with full Fanatec CSW setup + shifter + hanbrake and TrackIR5.I think this sim might be a good for additional training  for a driving license, maual gear shifting and getting reminded of some traffic rules.I wouldn't bother to try without a proper wheel, would recommend at least a Thrustmaster TX Leather Edition or T300 Alacantara and TH8 shifter addon.A few cons:1. No instructor voice2. Can't set sensivity/saturation for analog inputs3. Had an AI pulling into me from the left lane (EU), AI needs to learn traffic rules :)			"

Played it for a bit, and i love it, even though its a bit laggy (later found out that i had graphics at max settings so i turned them down and no lag) and i also love theres steam workshop for vehicles, so there no risk of getting viruses from dowloading cars off the internet!overall a good little game / educational software to play/use if you are bored if you like driving cars, this game should be a must.
