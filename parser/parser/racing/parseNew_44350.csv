												I really like GRID 2 and I think it's the best racing game on Steam. Just keep in mind that it's not a racing simulator like GRID. It's Need for Speed: Greatest Hits. I can see huge chunks of various NFS games put into the game nicely like Touge on the California Dixon track at night is a canyon race from Carbon, sponsor decals, body and performance mods are from Underground, circuit races strongly remind me of ProStreet. Cote d'Azur track alone reminds me of Porsche Unleashed and brings a smile to my face. Codemasters made a great arcade racing game.Strong sides of the game: gorgeous graphics, awesome physics in terms of car behavior, great online matchmaking, single player campaign is fun to play and interesting to progress, AI can be easily adjusted to a desired difficulty.Minor complaints that I have: there's no way to change the in-game assistant's voice. Personally I really dislike that voice and ended up muting it. Many games have an option to change the voice that talks to you while you play 'cause it's important! You're stuck with this voice for hundreds of hours. In Crysis I was able to choose the voice of the nanosuit (male/female/robotic), in SR: TT and many other games there're similar options. The DLCs certainly crippled the game. Extra tracks and cars just don't fit in properly, e. g. you can't use Ford Sierra RS500 online and nobody races on Bathurst unless you create a custom lobby and invite friends to play it. The lack of cockpit view is an insult. I also miss Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche cars, but don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars to play with.			"

												I got this game on sale, and I wanted to like this game, I really did. I loved the first GRID. The graphics are really nice, among the best for a racing game when it came out. The single-player story mode is cheesy, but it does okay to fill the gaps between races. The engine sounds are mostly accurate, far more so than the first GRID game. It's really unfortunate that this is where the good parts of the game end.The driving physics are awful. Literally some of the worst I've ever played. I understand they wanted to focus on drifting and making it a key component of racing, but it is so poorly implemented that certain vehicles are essentially unplayable. Driving the Koenigsegg Agera R is a nightmare... it feels exactly like driving on ice, which I have actual experience with, living in a place that gets really cold during the winter with tons of snow. It's really a shame that ALL of the cars drift. All of the vehicles, regardless of being described as ""Balanced"" and / or ""Grip"" when you select them, will drift, no matter how perfect you try to take a corner. As soon as you hit the brakes, you can feel the vehicle start to fishtail. Some cars are okay, but I've found at least 50% of the time, racing is just not an enjoyable experience.Even worse is the computer AI. They drive their line and regardless of if they hit a wall, if you bump them, and even if you try to spin them out, it's nearly impossible, they do not make mistakes. It feels exactly like a crappy simulation, minus actually simulating anything.I did enjoy the first 18 hours or so in the single-player game. Really the coolest part of the game was my second race when I drove up the side of a mountain, fell back down on top of the opponent's car, and still won the race. However, after over 21 hours, I've finally put my controller down in frustration, and most likely will not pick it back up for this game.			"

Before I proceed to the review, you should know that personally I'm racing games addict and cars lover from kid. You should know that I raced in many online leagues in reputable simulator: rFactor - it could have been even 800-1000 driven hours. You may ask ""why have you stepped back to GRID?"" - it's simple: I don't have time for preparations to compete in online leagues (1 race = whole week of training).Here's where the GRID2 steps in!HistoryGRID2 is the successor of Race Driver: GRID released in 2008, and it represents the same idea.. but somehow better. At first I need to refer into the roots of the first part of GRID - do you remember a game series called TOCA Race Driver? If not, Codemasters produced that series between 1997 and 2006. Because the sales were dropping, Codemasters decided to abandon TOCA and introduce new brand referring to the old product - Race Driver: GRID. I've personally played TOCA Race Driver 3 and I remember that game featured races not only in sportscars but also Monster Trucks and some motocross ones. It was therefore not only asphalt oriented races like the new GRID series. The success of Race Driver: GRID was an indicator to create a new game as GRID2.SingleplayerIn GRID2 you become professional racing driver from rookie just like in Race Driver: GRID. Your first race at Chicago circuit is the tutorial one before you become part of the WSR league (World Series Racing). After first race you're heading into your racing garage. The game features of a manager helping you to start your career. The campaign is very interesting because you start it from the rookie point of view: slow cars (Tier 1). Interesting thing introduced in GRID2 is that after every race you're not rewarded by money. You're rewarded by the number of fans that you got by completing the race. The game makes you feel like you're really important driver in that league. After a couple of races and challenges you need to complete the final one to get into higher tier. Every new tier brings new tracks from all over the world, game modes and of course new cars. Finishing the campaign on the difficulty set to high with all the achievements (50/60 without the DLCs) took me about 30-40 hours of playtime.Features* Game modes: Race, Elimination, Checkpoint and Faceoff.* Retrospection - the feature known from Race Driver: GRID, gives you the ability to rewind the time and correct your mistakes* There are some tracks based on the real life circuits like: Algarve, Red Bull Ring, Abu Dhabi and there are many configurations of the tracks* Cars are well balanced with their advantages and disadvantages measured on different tracks* Anti-cut-track system which gives you penalty (stop/go) for cutting the track* You can always change the difficulty and damage level* If you set the damage level to the highest, you can end up the race for example on the wall very easily* Very good graphics engine and optimalizations (playable on nVidia 9600 GT)* Nice destruction model and detailed statistics about your driver's career like in Race Driver: GRIDPhysicsThe game physics is demanding and the tracks are very well made with bumps and kerbs affecting the stability of the car. You can't set the details of the physics like traction control or ABS cause the physics is simplified. You need skills to control the situation all over the time. If you make a mistake, you pay for it. The physics gives slight advantage to those who oversteer the car in turns and drift while the FWD cars don't understeer as they should. You need to remember that the grip is changing depending on the surface. I would rate the physics as 70% arcade 30% simulation.MultiplayerAlive with many players as it's the extention of singleplayer mode. There are some moments where there's nobody to play with but that's a rare situation. The MP is hard because you start with the basic cars good for some tracks but bad for others. You need to race in order to receive money and buy better cars. Buying new cars isn't the end of story because afterwards you can modify them (of course by paying money). In the DLCs there are some paid cars that make the competition a little bit unfair. For example Mitsubishi Evo X is probably the best drift car in the game, better than the free ones. The anti-cut-track system is not perfect in some situations because there are places where huge cutting (cheating) won't give you the penalty. It's also popular that the penalized driver (stopped for a couple of seconds) does a very bad thing to others: he directs himselft on the path of incoming opponents to caught them on his bumper. It's also reffering to the culture of players because some of them race only to eliminate others, but it's better than it sounds :)ControllersI've tested the game on keyboard and externals: controller Logitech F310 and wheel Logitech G25. The controllers are well discovered and set perfectly. Some cars like Koenisegg are created to be the fastest and hardest so even on the wheel there's a lack of grip on that car and losing control. In general I can tell you that the cars from Tier 4 can be handed perfectly only on the wheel but I disliked doing it in MP.Drawbacks and issues* Anti-cut-track bugs on some tracks* Lack of cockpit camera which was in the Race Driver: GRID* Lack of the option to change the degree lock for wheel* Lack of balancing feature in MP - players are always mixed with different level and skill.* The serious issue I have is: problem with not saving the options to the configuration file (it's locked all the time so I can't even read it). I need therefore to change the graphics options everytime I run the game while there's no problem with the settings of controller (they are in different file). I got used to it but I have the same issue in Race Driver: GRID so maybe it's Windows 8.1 related issue.SummaryTo sum up the review, in my opinion GRID2 is worth the money. It provides a lot of fun both in singleplayer and multiplayer and on every controller. To this day I still enjoy the multiplayer and I was also invited to drive for one of the Polish leagues - Goes Like Hell. I don't treat it seriously cause I play GRID2 for chillout, but it's the next challenge for me and possibility for players to spend here many more hours.Race Driver: GRID or GRID2?The 1st part is a little more like simulation so my advice would be: enjoy your playtime at first in Race Driver: GRID and when you'll finish it, buy GRID2 :)Game tested on:AMD Phenom II X4 945, Nvidia 9600, Windows 8.1			"

												I want to clear up that im not going to include Grid 1 to this review. Gameplay on the tracks are mainly based on acrade style racing. Its all about investment in a new league of sport and becoming the number #1 contender and the number 1# fan.What I like about Grid 2 are the tracks. They are fun and challenging to race on in career mode and online. The car personaliztion is near enough good, throwing in real life sponsors to put onto your car and personalize. I was disappointed with the physics in use of the cars as the developers focused on the powersliding instead of clean turn exits to build better momentum through the corners. You may think thats essential for a great game but the handling will lead you to wreckless driving in most modes challenged on. Online as an example is almost unplayable for these reasons because players cant take full stable control around the corners for a clean race. Another thing I was disapointed in was the input controls on the game. For a controller it wont be much of a problem driving cars but for keyboard users it will be. Most racing inputs ive used was the simple w,s,a,d & (Arrows) and have no issues playing them smootly. For Grid 2 its difficult as its not keyboard friendly in a way of keeping your car stable around the corners and attempting most clean races. Ive tried both controller (F710)  & keyboard and its a major difference how you perform in the game.Cockpit is not required in the game which is another downside for a latest racing release. DLC packs have been scattered around as typical developers want more money off you. Pros:+ Tracks to drive on+ PersonalztionCons:- Controls are unstable- Not Keyboard friendly compare to most racing games- No Cockpit- Codemasters greedy DLC Schemes- Graphics are not as good for its ageMy rating: 65/100Metascore rating: 80/100Conclusion:I dont reccomend this game full price for the aspects ive pointed out from it. If steam provide a discount give it a go and see what you think. Hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game.			"

												This game is no simulator, and i've only played with gamepad. After 7 hours I have to say i'm disssapointed, coming from GRID 1.The game now focuses on city circuits with different gamemodes (Elimination, circuit changes on the go...) and doesn't focus on real competitions like the first one no Open wheel/DTM/GT/LMP classes of events and no Lemans Resistance races when the season ends. In 7 hours i've only visited 4 circuits so far, with no serious competition on them (just regular races, with different car classes on the same race), and the handling i'd say is a bit worse than on the first, with they wanting you to drift in every corner.The plot of the game is to make a new series of racing globally, taking the best drivers of each part of the world. in each part of the world there are different gamemodes. (guess what: in japan they drift)The game also feels like it puts together different vehicle classes and they more or less perform the same (Chevrolet Camaro against a Alfa Romeo 4C comes to mind)And the whole point of 'we have to get fans from social networks to talk about us' with the TV show stuff (The game's storyline, i'd say) just feels for 12 years old. I'd say they wanted to make the game easier for younger people. I really liked GRID 1, but this one is average, shouldn't call itself GRID.			"

												If you like games like Burnout and Need 4 Speed. You might like this game. If you're expecting an experience along the lines of something like Forza or GT look somewhere else.   I myself can't hate this game enough. I hate everything about it. Codemasters feels the need to infuse GRID and DIRT with this huge amount of 'bro talk', MT DEW and fake pop culture. Which really just makes me sick. It's insulting. The track line up is laughable as well. I can't think of anything positive to say about this game besides it's not for everyone. Some out there will find GRID 2 to be just what they need. The Burnout, and Need 4 Speed type of players. Nothing wrong with that.  I simply hate this game. The original GRID was so much more enjoyable and I was hoping to find that with GRID 2. That enjoyment was nowhere to be found for me.			"

												This review is focused on the singleplayer aspect of this game.Pros:- Fairly nice to look at- Good sound design- Bathurst- Decent length careerCons:- Handling inferior to the original GRID- I have seen better AI in N64 racing games- AI vehicles are also far stronger than player vehicle, which causes trouble with the high likelihood of AI colliding with player- Rubbing against a wall while turning a corner may result in a sudden outbreak of the Flips- No longer has the 'build your own racing team' style of the original, which I feel makes the game less appealing- Have to pay extra for Bathurst (and on that note, there is quite a catalogue of DLC which indicates that a decent amount of content was cut from the game for DLC, the same problem was had with DiRT 3.)This is not really a bad game. However, it is inferior to its predecessor- your money would be much better spent on that.Still could be worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of the series though.			"

												Game is good but i don't recommend it for a few reasons unless it's on sale or you can get it from a trader:_ ""Racenet"" If you want to do the global challenges or fully enjoy the multiplayer experience you need to have an account, like the rival thing. I thought your Steam friends are your rivals but no no, only racenets friends are your rivals._ DLC you have not many cars unless you buy the dlc, also some circuits are only available after you buy overpriced DLC (5$, 6$, 10$)_ Your car is made of ♥♥♥♥ing polysteren when your opponents car are made of titanium. Ram them while taking a turn you fly away, stick behind them but keep accelerating you'll go at their speed and they wont even flinch. If they ram you during a turn you can be sure you'll loose control of your vehicle. If they're behind you pushing and you try to slow down or break you'll loose control, if you keep at your pace the back of your car will go sideways until you loose control. Driving a muscle car and getting hit by a roadster still makes you fly + damage your vehicle. _ Drift cars, the worst thing in this game and there's plenty of race to do with these. The cars keep oversteering._ Pinball effect, if you hit a wall you'll bounce on the ramp on the other side of the road._ Sometimes if you're against the wall and hit a cone your car will explode._ Opponents are driving at your speed, if you're slow they'll be slow. If you're ahead of them they'll catch up with you no matter how perfect you're racing._ Except for you there's never any crash, if you're causing a pile up you'll be the only one ending up off road. The opponents will follow their racing lanes no matter what's happening ahead.I think that pretty much sums up why i can't recommend this game, maybe these seem like small things but when every races you're the only one loosing control (and not just a little) once there's frictions between you and your opponent that you have to restart or  go back in time every time it gets irritating.About the good things of this game?_ Graphics are pretty neat_ Different kind of events (Touge, Race, Time Attack, Drifts, Endurance, Takeover etc)_ Car customisation_ Decent career mode.

												Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. I've been disapointed with this one. The graphics are improved and the damage model is still excellent. My problem is the handling and physics of the game. They just seem off. I spent most of the time starting out only drifting around turns (I hate drifting). Once I got it more figured out it got better but is still disapointing. Also not to mention that there is a lack of a cockpit view in the game. I got this game on summer sale for a great price and still feel like a wasted my money. There are better racing games out there if you are interested in buying one. I don't recomend this one unless you want to give it a try and don't have to spend much money on it.UPDATE: So I don't believe many people realize what I'm trying to explain. So let me go into some more details. The game is beatuiful, amazing in looks. The damage looks real and the system for the career looks like it's great and laid out very well. The handling of the cars is what really turns me off from this. It's a cross between an arcade racer and a simulator. This compared to arcade racers is much harder and this compared to simulaters such as Gran Turismo is a joke. If you are willing to tweke settings and work on controlling the car perfectly its worth a buy but if you are just interested in jumping into a car and racing avoid it.I like my simulators and Iike arcade racing games. Games like GRID 1, Forza, Gran Turismo, Burnout, Need for Speed all have pros and cons. Same with the game it has pros and cons. I tend to fall on a con side not liking this very much. I guess part is I was such a huge fan of GRID 1 that this one has changed so much I dislike it but I would rather play either a true arcade racer that I know what I'm getting or a true Simulator that I know how the car will handle. These crossover games that are an inbetween style I really don't like and hope they will fade out. If you try the game and like it great! If not it's probably a similar reason as me, it's not dedicated to one style of racing games it tries to hit both and misses the mark.			"

												People are very critical with this game saying:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)Actually:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)So why I still recommend this game? Sure it is arcade and if you have ever driven a car with more than 200 HP than you will probably say this is bU11$h'""+t. I have not done it before. So I can say in here it is so much fun. There are a lots of nice cars, from the street and from the racing tracks also. Driving really gives you the 'fast' feeling unlike other racing games (and yes here I meant NFS). Tracks are also nice (altough maybe some more would be better but it is still enough for a career game). Graphics are okay I guess, the effects are cool but there are some details when you feel that it could have been done nicer - maybe it was a price to pay to let older PCs also run this.  If you like fast cars and you do not mind some little mistakes and arcade-ness this game is just for you. Else you should go with a real sim.			"

												I anxiously awaited this game.  For years I watched Codemasters release ""F1"" and uninspiring ""Dirt ""titles waiting for a followup to the original Race Driver: Grid.   When I finaly got my wish I found very little of the original GRID DNA.  Tracks are gorgeous but few in number.  Car control isn't as good as the original and it seems Codemasters has come down with a serious case of ""Need For Speed"" -Itis.  In other words, The game constantly pushes DLC and relies on a quirky multiplayer engine akin to EA's Autolog.  The real problem is, that unless you pay to play you're not going to get very far in MP racing.  The game is pale in comparison to the original and wasn't worth the wait IMHO.			"

												This is a fun arcade-racer that I have really enjoyed playing since I bought it back in September 2014, Some people like to base it off the original Grid, but this game is definitely has more of an arcade feel to it while Grid 1 I felt was more of a simulator. The Online Multiplayer Racing can be fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of the driving style that the game brings to the table and also when you make friends with a bunch of other respectable racers also... The sad things about the Online is that it is dying (I suggest you switch your download region on steam to London-UK to find more people) and there are those occasional hackers every now and then that can ruin the fun, but I enjoy the hell out of this game and playing with my racing buddies... I would recommend you buy this game when it is on sale, the $50 price tag for the reloaded edition is kind of expensive when you look at the age of the game. If you are an arcade racing game fan, I would recommend this game to you. I would believe you would enjoy this game.			"

												I think the biggest problem of this game is in it's name: if it wouldn't have been called ""GRID"" it could get away with what it is. But people look at it and expect the experience they had with Racedriver: GRID, which this game doesn't deliver.First of all, unlike Rd:Grid the game doesn't allow the player to customize his driving experience. Rd:Grid was like ""you wanna play with keyboard? fine, here is a bunch of assists so you can handle the car with those keys. you get better at it, turn some of them off and get extra enjoyment!"" or ""ofcourse a car would slide, but only if you are not carefull enough with the throttle in the exit of the corner. still cannot tame it? just move the TC slider a little bit backwards"". This freedoms resulted in great accessebility and immense fun of driving whatever you input device was. Instead, GRID 2 says ""we got TrueFeel(tm), we have World SIDEWAYS Racing, we are all flashy and hooked up on fans which you gotta impress, so you are going to play the game OUR way!""Obligatory drifting. Oh gosh, i didn't think i ever see it this series. Thing is, you cannot tell if you are faster without it. It has  become part of the game.Again, comparing to Rd:Grid, sliding the car was never an option if you were going to set a time. You would go for a clean line, resorting to sliding in rare instances, and yet it was fully up to the player. Sliding a corner made you feel ""Hahaha yeah!"" or ""Oops, steady, steady!"". GRID 2 does it like ""Right, here we go again..."".Not knowing all that, I jumped into it with my itching fingers ready over arrow keys and was for a surprise. ""OK, it won't be easy"", i thought, and i got better at it, although still failing to have as much fun as i expected. But i kept my hopes up by thinking, ""OK, maybe if i get a controller, i might actualy get to enjoy it..."". WRONG. No ingame customization for controller device leaves it almost as clunky as keyboard. (to be fair there might be a way to make it better by editing xml file, but that's yet to find out). As it turned out, reading different forums, the game was desigined primarily for full-on steering wheel controllers, walking straight past keyboards and pads like they are history. Only a handfull of those hardcore devices seem to provide a player with  full control over the car. Yet in a game, that positions itself as leaning towards arcade driving experience...Another complaint is the track design. There are not a lot of tracks and locations to choose from. Racing tracks are alright. The trouble hides on city circuits and winding road courses. Like if half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥controls isn't enough, these end up being littered with hazards, things to hit or send a car flying off the road. Moreover, there simply isn't enough room for 12 hotheads to have their way through, making every game mode a demolition derby. This was not an issue in Rd:Grid.Coupled with turtle-paced progression of multiplayer, which doesn't reward you for anything besides placing in top 3, you will soon find that if you can't enjoy the driving in this game, there is nothing else left to look for.

												GRID 2 tries to bring a sort of story element to its career progression. Longtime fans of Codemasters’ racing games might remember the TOCA Race Driver series implementing the same idea. In regards to GRID 2, it’s about one American billionaire called Patrick Callahan, who is launching a new franchise – World Series Racing (WSR) – and has noticed your dazzling skills in the game’s opening introduction race. From there, you become the material to promote WSR across the world and are given the challenge to bring more people to the sport. How do you do this? By beating all the other rivals around the world.An assortment of events populate each season in GRID 2. For example, the first season is set in America and involves racing from point A to point B, but then you move to season three, which is set in Asia and includes events like Touge and Drifting. Along the way you’ll also get to participate in elimination races and overtake challenges. It’s fantastic that the game is throwing a varied amount of events at the player. Making your way through the seasons introduces more powerful cars. Even though GRID 2 includes around 45 cars, it manages to cover a range of types.AI, for the most part, is good and feels to have been given an aggressive characteristic, as these racers aren’t afraid to grind metal with metal with the player. Codemasters has managed to pinpoint that line between realism and arcade racing, allowing anyone who enjoys racing games but isn’t into those that try to represent a serious realism of the sport to come to GRID 2 and get in with humble ease. Online multiplayer is great fun. Players can set up their own playlist of events and what cars to use. At first, the online is limited with its vehicle selection, since the online multiplayer has its own level-up system. Hitting a target level will unlock more cars, which you can then purchase with the earnings you get from taking part in race events online.GRID 2 is a fantastic looking game on the PC. The cars look great and tracks shine with plenty of details. Sound design is brilliant, with loud, roaring car engines blasting out, giving that sense of power coming from high-performance cars.The return of the GRID franchise isn’t as ground-breaking as I would have hoped, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great racer.

												The biggest issue with GRID 2 (and GRID 1 to an extent) is how much of a realist are you?If realism and or simulation of how race cars really handle is important to you, then GRID 2 is the worst of the bunch.A comparision I like to make on how the cars feel in Grid 2 is with Ridge Racer as the handling in GRID 2 follows the same overly eager grip that allows you to take a 90 degree turn at 120 mph. While the realism of GRID 2 is no where as dumbed down as a title like Ridge Racer, it IS pretty basic. If you have ANY experience in driving an automobile over 90 mph, then you will knowthat the cars in GRID 2 do not behave realistically at all.Graphically the game is fine. Nice effects that don't bog my system down.However, the gameplay and races themselves tend to get stale rather quickly.Once you have raced a certain type of race don't expect to see much difference in setup, length or quality of the AI from race to race either.The AI doesn't ""get better"" or any such luck, what you start with is what you get.The multiplayer in GRID 2 is dead (in the US at least) and has been for a long time.I have yet to find one single multiplayer session located in the US and no one ever joined any sessions I created.In the U.K. their seems to be a bigger following to non-oval type racing and so you can usually find more multiplayer options, but not many Steam users are willing to fiddle with Steam settings to get locked into U.K. race servers.All and all, GRID 2 was a big step back in the series with features missing, or massive DLC to get the whole package required.I hear GRID Autosport (Grid 2.5?) is a step back to the Grid 1 roots, but to be honest GRID 2 destroyed my faith in the GRID franchise to keep me away from any hope of liking it again anytime soon.If you are looking for a good arcade racer, GRID 2 is fine in short bursts.However, if you are the type to invest in a wheel and pedals and know the difference in how a car handles with or without automatic gear box, then I would stay away from GRID 2.

 About GRID 2	I have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out. Release Date: 28 May, 2013 Single Player Campaign	GRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into ""seasons,"" with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.Online Multiplayer	The GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.Replay Factor	One of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.The Graphic	GRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.All in All  GRID 2 is a really nice Racing Game!9/10 From Me Sweep "

												According to some statistics made by the developers, they removed interior view since only like 30% used it and upon playing the game for a while you'll discover that was not the only thing they removed to save development cost and time.Pro:- Good graphics.- Decent audio, apart from the obnoxious low frequency noises switching between menus.- Fun for a short while.- Damage model- Online demolition derby.Cons:- Lack of interrior view.- Lack of any game music/theme.- No rear view mirror, you have to look back.- Extremely annoying slow animation transitions between menus, customisation..etc (aesthetics infavor of functionality)- Pure arcade car handling.- Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing.- Extremely annoying announcer everywhere with a sense of humor matching a cheesy car salesman, and unskipable.- Pay 2 win dlcs for online racing, as you get very few cars for online racing.- Rubberbanding AI.Overall impression: meh... skip it.

												While I enjoyed my time with GRID 2 (playing the campaign to completion), I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good example of a racing game.The odds in the game are pretty much stacked against you every which-way. If an opponent touches you your car will, nine times out of ten, spin out and you lose a ridiculous amount of ground. However, if YOU touch an opponent, you'll still receive the brunt of the damage and time lost. The AI relies wholly on rubber-banding too - drive badly, they will be more forgiving, drive well, and they'll go toe to toe with you. The gamemodes are generally enjoyable. The problem is how the game creates progression late-game. Instead of new tracks, the game simply extends old ones, or, by season 5, makes you do the same 6 mile course three times over. This wears thin quickly, and the endgame feels more like a grind than an edge-of-your-seat world championship.The game looks nice, the tracks are nice - hell, the cars are nice (if you're prepared to drop upwards of $5 to use the good ones). But when the actual gameplay is as infuriating as GRID 2 is, it really isn't worth your time/money - particularly at full price. I happpened across my copy in a Humble Bundle, and I'd be wary of paying any more than the $4 I shelled out for that bundle on this game alone.			"

Value I purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this ""North Pole Noir"" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are  number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.  Aspect Rating   Physics 10   Plot 10   Damage 9   Multiplayer 10   Community 10   Graphics 10+   Value 8   Overall 9.5  Final Points on the Game Not only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games.

												This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is more about drifting around corners than about finding the fastest racing line. It is almost like OutRun, you just are slower if you don't drift your way around corners. The rewind feature makes a return, further solidifying the arcade direction the series has taken with this sequel.There is no cockpit view or car setup and tuning options are minimal and only available in multiplayer. Multiplayer may appear deserted and it does suffer from low population because of matchmaking regions being based upon your Steam download server's location. There is a lively multiplayer community, but to play with more people you need to change your Steam download region to UK - London and preferably also own all of the DLC packages to get better matchmaking.In multiplayer your goal is to gain money and experience to level up to unlock new cars and upgrades which you then have to buy with the money you earned. Your multiplayer experience can be a mixed bag then in itself. In ""Playlists"" there is no voting on game modes or choice of circuits, instead the lobby is assigned a random track, car tier and gamemode. Players then have the ability veto the combination once. If the combination is vetoed you are assigned another random combination without the ability to veto it.  There is also the ""Custom Events"" option which are events hosted by other players. You gain less money and experience from participating in ""Custom Events,"" and only the lobby host can decide the settings of the event. The host has a wide variety of changeable settings, varying from type of event to forcing every player to use manual gears. There is a system called ""Impact Ratings"" in the multiplayer, which shows other players how dirty their opponents race. These are represented by circles with exclamation marks in them, with the ranking going White-Green-Yellow-Red from the best to the worst. Players with too little data to assign them an ""Impact Rating"" show as grey. The rating persists over races, and can change over time. Lots of online races tend to have people crashing into each other a lot, so do not pay too much mind to your ""Impact Rating."" When ""Impact Ratings"" are enabled, you gain a small cash bonus at the end of the race based on your rating.Also available in the Multiplayer menu are the ""Global Challenges."" These are a set of random events raced on certain circuits with either a certain Tier of cars or a specific car. Instead of racing head-to-head with another player, this game mode is leaderboard based. The game tracks your performance in the events and compares your scores to your friends. The person on the top of the leaderboard is considered to be leading the event. There are medals on the events, granting you small amounts of money and experience for passing their requirements. Based on your position on the leaderboard in the specific events you gain points for the overall leaderboard which shows who among your friends is the best racer overall. The set of events changes every few days with the leaderboards wiped at the same time.The ""Singleplayer Career"" mode casts you as the rising new talent in the fictional new racing series called World Series Racing or WSR for short. In the singleplayer you proceed through ""Seasons"" of the series, completing events and unlocking new cars from challenges. As you progress through the career you gain access to more exotic cars, going from the old muscle cars and small European hatchbacks of Tier 1 to immensely powerful and rare cars like the Koenigsegg Agera R in Tier 4. The car selection has more of an emphasis on normal street legal cars rather than Touring Cars and the like. There is no Circuit de la Sarthe or the LMP class cars to be found in this game. The circuit selection varies from fantasy street courses to real life race tracks like Brands Hatch, Indianapolis and Yas Marina. Unlike the multiplayer, the cars are simply unlocked by completing separate challenges, and cannot be upgraded. The looks of the cars can be customised with paint colour, vinyls, wheels and sponsorship logos. The sponsors also have specific challenges for you to complete. Your progress throughout the career is tracked by the amount of ""Fans"" you have. You gain fans from completing sponsor objectives and placing well in events. The ""Fans"" statistic is hidden in Codemasters' ""Racenet"" service in the multiplayer, and has no real effect on that part of the game.I don't like how the AI can nudge your car around but you really can't do the same to them. I played the game mostly on Medium difficulty, and it is easy if you just race very physically, using the other cars to navigate corners. The AI gets really challenging on Hard and becomes a far more frustrating experience. In my opinion there is noticeable gap in the AI skill between Hard and Medium that really shows in the way they react to you driving aggressively.Graphically GRID 2 looks very impressive. The crashes look nice with parts flying off and shrapnel scattering all over. The stages look nicely detailed: urban stages have detailed buildings surrounding you as you race down the streets. Forest stages look threatening with hills and dense forest just outside the track, ready to punish from the slightest mistakes with formidable damage. The game is also very well optimised and runs well even on older hardware. Sounds are probably the weakest part of the game, with similar engine sounds for most of the cars and a very annoying tire squeal sound effect. There is also the sound of crowds cheering, but beyond that ambient sounds are nonexistent.Grid 2 is a solid arcade racer with great graphics, but is sadly hamstrung by its emphasis on drifting over real racing lines, stagnant AI and multiplayer which frequently devolves to a demolition derby. Fans of more arcade racing games like the Need For Speed series will find much to like here, while fans of the more realistic approach of the first game should give this game a pass.			"

												I wasn't sure if I could recommend it or not. The game can be fun, but it might be frustrating either.First of all: the sngle player mode. Basically your goal is to beat Harrison Carter (a bot), who always finishes first or second (if you're first). The rest of bots is always drunk so don't even mind them. A car driven by AI which is in front of you is always slower than you. It can't drift, never puts pedal to the metal. Is it easy to overtake them? Of course not. The roads are usually so narrow that you're usually blocked by AI cars. If any other car touches yours or you touch it, you'll instantly spin out so don't even try to crash the bots. And here goes the magic! Whenever a car driven by AI is behind you, it starts driving like a pro: never uses break, never reduces speed, never touches anything (and if so, its car isn't damaged at all). It overtakes you in a moment and then it becomes the slow one again. Oh and the best thing, you always starts from the second to last position so have fun with being blocked by cars in front of you and being bumped by cars behind you.The multiplayer is totally unfair. Guy who starts from better position (especially the first and the second) has always a huge adventage. If he is as good as you, and has a good car you have no chance to overtake him. Also there isn't really any punishment for attacking others so feel free to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and keep on hitting any car you want.Multiplayer is fun when you play with your friends (unless they play fair).

												Good graphics, decent car list. That about sums up the positives.The physics, oh boy. To be quick, you have to drift, which in itself goes against ANY logic, at least on tarmac. And the way you drift is moronic as well- the car just steps out, no matter what you do. If you try driving sensibly, you understeer like you're running bald summer tires in snow. If you don't want to do so, you have to drift, but how can you do it properly when throttle control basically doesn't exist? It just boggles my brain that a game of this pedigree can handle worse than Mario Kart 64.This is the worst driving game I own by far. I regret spending 6EUR on it, even though it was in a bundle. Speaking of which, can you refund Humble Bundle games?			"

												Dear God, what have you done to GRID?Still insisting on finishing it as a fan, halfway through season 2 I realized they must've said something like ''Lets not bother with putting actual damage mechanics, simulation aspects from the original game, cockpit view etc, but instead, lets give the cars absurd physics and call it a simulation''.No matter which difficulty setting you're playing on (tried all), your car is your biggest opponent. It will constantly try to spin no matter what you do, just staying on the road is a challenge and it gets better and better when an opponent actually 'touches' your car, no matter which position, no matter what speed, say hello to the wall over there.I'll probably finish it for the sake of achievements and completion but hell, doing it with a vw golf because it's one of the few cars that manages to stay on the damned road is a shame...Screw graphics, go buy the original GRID, still beats this one.

												TLDR at the bottom.I came into this expecting a better and updated Grid 1, a worthy successor to a pretty decent (although flawed) racing game.What i got was a chineese bootleg of need for speed.Grid 1's physics though quirky and in dire need of a few small fixes have been thrown completely out the window in favour of some simplified super arcady system that bears no resembelance of realism to the first one.Grid 1's cars had a ""points rating"" for performance 4/5 5/5 ect. This is not a very good system but in Grid 2 they have moved to an even worse system where each stat of performance is a bar. This makes comparing cars virtually impossible. not to mention the majority of cars share the same statline.the cutscenes are cringeworthy, They strike right into the heart of the ""old white man trying to appeal to young kids of the digital age"" as if the game is almost a parody of itself. The ESPN sections are especially cringeworthy, i wonder how much their paid for licensing to an american only complay for an american live action cutscene THAT IS UNSKIPPABLE. Atleast they have done away with the horrible sponsor screen from GRID 1. that would take  way too long to scroll. Grid 2 allows you to skip alot of parts.Pros:More carsUpdated GraphicsPost-Race Sponsor rundownCons:Physics is terribleunskippable cringeworhty cutscenesPhysics are awfulAI is on rails & cheatsThe game is legitimately not fun to drive in.By far the worst event is the random track events without a co-driver or minimap its a random chance that a corner is a hairpin or open. you have to take every corner at slow speed.Alot of other events are 1-3 laps meaning you have no time to learn the circuit at all. TLDR: its not Grid 2. Its bootleg need for speed. If you like the NFS series. enjoy if you wanted a successor to Grid1. youre SOL.			"

												Before buying the game be aware of what Codemasters Customer Services says: ""This version of the game does not officially support Windows 10"" and ""We have no plans for a Windows 10 patch"". The game runs like a charm on my PC, but it crashes to Windows desktop every 3-5 minutes, often in a middle of a race series. I've tried all the guides community post all over the internet on this problem and none of them help. And with no help from tech support, I guess I've just poured my money to drain.			"

												Its a very good game though for me not as good as the Grid One was. I just like more simulation than it's in this part. The grid one gave a choice in multiplayer. This one does not. Anyway, playability is still very good, competition and player development makes it almost imposible to stop playing the effect ""just one more race"" is definitely there, then you become a new car and have to test it and so on. Easy to play, hard to master. And nobody should be angry that it is not an Gran Tourismo or a Forza. Graphics 7/10, Sound 8/10, Gameplay 9/10. Arcade 70% Simulation 30% Gameplay isnt the most important  thing for me but I give it a nine out of 10 score because of the DLC politics.			"

												Well, Codemasters, I have been racing with you since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, V8 Supercars 2 and now in the present: coming from F1-2010 to 2013 I felt like a change, and decided over Dirt 3 that I buy Grid 2. First I will start with the cons. -Firstly, NO DRIVERS CAM? What kind of racing game doesn't have that!? Even Colin Mcrae which was a 2000s' era game had it! I get the feeling this isn't a simulation game but more of an arcade. -Secondly yes the realism. The damage model is excellent, smashing into things has never been so fun. But lacks, tire wear and rain? Can't change car setups in career mode unless its hidden? I have looked.-Thirdly Racenet... I am logged in, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out why my times don't show on the friend scoreboard in career mode, I have tried logging out and back in but no cigar. As a competitive racer, I is sad about this.-Lastly the price of the All In DLC is way too expensive for a game which is now dead. By dead I mean, I cannot find a single online race. I won't waste money on unlocking cars I cannot use.OK now for the pros!-Firstly I'm more of a grippy guy so seeing a variety of cars is great! I get such a rush from using the Caterham, it grips so well and it flies. -The graphics are beautiful and at max settings I never dip below 60fps-The career mode. What can I say, an immersive story in which you are a racer working up through the ranks with goodies like unlocking cars  watching the protagonist gain social media attention and fans, The AI provide a challenge even though I have yet to lose a race or even finish second (Hard difficaulty, damage on, flashbacks on)My conclusions is, as a racing fan who always leaned towards Formula One, it was nice to get back to actual road cars. Please remember this is my review, my opinion. I'm sure you think differently and you will let me know in the comments.			"

												Exceptional bad mechanics. Every single car drifts, making it totally unpleasant. The worst part is the abysmal AI of the cars, taking racing lines regardless if you are taking the line and then there is the factor that any car can bump you off track. They bump into your backside and you spin, you bump into their backside and you spin. All in all this is a poor game which I received as a gift and won't spend a penny on.  "

												This is probably one of the best, if not the best, racing games on Steam. Sure, the graphics are maybe a year or two behind, but the game was released in 2013. That being said, I think that it still stands up to newer games like Forza. Every once in a while this game goes on sale for next to nothing. That means that anyone can afford it if they wait for the perfect opportunity. If you want a realistic driving simulator, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a great driving game with an incredibly vast on-line mode and a story mode worth playing, it's all right here. I like it. I think you'll like it.			"

												- DLC bloated. Sometimes, from 10 cars you COULD use, 8 come from DLCs.- Annoying, long, cheesy cut-scene sequences- Drifting worse than GRID (1)- Bad bots are too bad, leading bots are too good. You always start at the end, and you have to mow through all the bad bots, who are simply road block for you. After you've done that, you have to chase down those bots, who HAPPEN to start at the front every single time. Gets pretty annoying after some time.			"

												9/10 -Great sense of speed and collection of cars. The damage system is spectacular and racing your friends is always fun. All the cars handle like a dream. The engines sound like the real thing. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the game doesn't have a cockpit view (inside the car) and you can't upgrade or tune your car in anyway in singleplayer but you can customize your ride like change rims, tire size, colors and decals. Multiplayer on the other hand you can tune your car making it faster. I hate how this game has so much DLC because if you own a certain DLC and your friend doesn't you can't play it with them making that new DLC useless unless you want to play it by yourself. Overall it's the best street racing game I ever played but just short of perfect.			"

												After my favorite racing game of all time called GRID and a long wait,I expected a lot of GRID 2 thinking that this will be another awesome simulation masterpiece,but I thought wrong.GRID 2 is nothing like it's previous part and it didn't achieve my expectation but still,I can not say that this game is not good.GRID 2 is a great racing game on it's own way.True it is arcade gameplay but still very enjoyable one and not that simple as it may seem like.Every car have it's own behaviour,grip,drift or balanced type cars they all have a different feel and most of them are challenging to drive if you are aiming for the limit.Driving get even more exciting knowing that there is no option to turn on stability or traction control,racing line or a breaking point.Your driving depends only on your own knowledge with the cars and tracks.Career mod is good,there are many different cars in a different tiers,a lot of tracks and a lot of different race types you will go through and makes you feel like a real driver.AI is not as strong as on GRID but they do sometimes hit you on a straight line with no reason maybe just to prepare you better for a multiplayer.Speaking of a multiplayer,great thing is that you can have all cars in garage and you are able to upgrade most of them.You even have a option to fully upgrade a car which will then be in a next tier with other stronger cars and making your driving more challenging.Driving clean races is very hard on multiplayer because there are so many different car types in a same tier which requires different racing style and ""I didn't mean to"" is almost unavoidable,so I mostly prefer collisions off settings.Not like on GRID,here you get penalized for cutting the corner but on the other hand,you wont get penalized for so-called ""riding the wall"" thing where you can gain time and make other players angry.Graphics are very good,details of the cars,tracks,places and cityes are awesome.Car damage is ok,physics are not so good.There is this ridiculous thing when you crash on some street track and the car bounces form side to side across the track like a pinball.As a fan of a GRID series,GRID 2 deserves a great 8.5/10 because for me game basicly have only 2 problems, 1.It steps out from first GRID, 2.GRID Autosport was released too soon.

												I played through single player with my Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. I didn't try playing it with a controller, but I do know that this game is designed to be controller friendly.I found this game to give a really fun racing experience without being punishingly difficult or realistic. Unlike games that are designed to be simulations first, it really feels like GRID 2 is designed to be a fun game first.The fun comes from a few things. First of all, the racing does really feel ""intense"" - this comes through thanks to all the great visuals and sounds. It's not easy to describe, but there's just loads of polish on the overall aesthetic. The wide variety of levels and locations really helps here as well.Second of all, they have lots of little ways to prevent you from getting frustrated. My favorite mechanic is the flashback mechanic - it basically lets you rewind time to undo a mistake you made. This is really great because not only does it prevent you from going ""oh no, I need to restart the whole race..."", it also gives you the opportunity to learn much more quickly. There's a limit to how many times you can do this so it doesn't make the game too easy. Furthermore, they have a wide range of difficulty settings for all levels of experience. I have only played a few racing games and found the Easy difficulty to be decently challenging without being frustrating. Finally, they have this guy who is talking to you all the time who will ocassionally offer useful suggestions and keep you focused on what to do during a race (and it doesn't get annoying, in my opinion).Third, the overarching story of trying to get fame for the WSR feels like a pretty significant goal. There's lots of different ways you can advance the story (for example, if you don't like a particular type of event you can focus on other types of events).My major issue with the game is that, towards the fourth WSR series, I felt like the content was becoming a bit same-y and it started to feel like a bit of a grind.Overall, if you are interested in having a fun racing experience as a change from a hardcore, realistic racing sim, this game is pretty fun. I haven't played many other PC games in the genre, though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt.			"

Product received for free
												GRID 2 is a half-simulator, half arcade style racer that is a genuine balance between both styles of racing genre and can be categorised in a league of its own in terms of car handling and circuit design. Interior view has been removed from the original GRID which is disappointing as I feel that this camera view adds authenticity to a racing game, even if it is rarely used, I would’ve liked to switch views mid-race to know that my driver was steering the car.  The music being added at climatic points in each event adds immersion in the racing experience, unlike games such as Forza or Gran Turismo which have static tracks played all race. This game is a minor step down in drifting compared to GRID 1, however city circuit tracks for regular racing seem to have a realistic transition between brick, asphalt and kerbs unlike the games predecessor.Codemasters has created World Racing League ‘WCR’ were your job is to race a variety of racing clubs from the US, Middle-East, Europe and Asia to attract ‘fans’. The inclusion of ESPN a well-known sport commentating channel in the US adds a layer of mirrored fame found in real life and adds depth in the single player experience, which helps new players to the genre engage in this racing game. The addition of displaying short story clips of your racing fame across YouTube, the WSR in game website and SMS messages motivates you to aim for a greater number of fans. While story typically lacking in racing games, Codemasters has pulled of a story mode that doesn’t ruin the experience of racing or feel that there is any difficulty in progressing to the next race as skipping events is optional. As you near completion of a race, overtaking a threat (another popular driver), complete a race or experience damage issues your crew chief will annoy you which adds to the enjoyment of the game but gets repetitive as you progress through the game. Throughout the game the same tracks, modes and simular challenges were reused however the difficulty of driving a faster vehicle in the later stages of the game compensates for this. Codemasters could pull some of the officially licenced world class circuits from the F1 series into Grid 2.In short the singleplayer provides a decent range of content despite the large amount of additional content and will give at least 24 hours of gameplay in the base game*, additional tracks including the extravagant demolition derby has been brought from GRID 1 in a free DLC which is brilliant for local multiplayer fun with friends and family. The demolition derby features only one car to choose from that is kitted out just for demolition events which you can select in the quick race menu for single or multiplayer modes. It was disappointing that Grid 2 features the same tracks as its predecessor, which feels like Codemasters reworked the handling of the vehicle in this mode to be significantly easier to control, making it harder to slide out. *Please do note that I have played this game for console on release week. *In GRID 2 online unlike the ‘WRS’ singleplayer mode you can purchase and upgrade vehicles performance. The new rivalry mode allows users to set up randomly assigned online players which compete for XP to crown the ‘better racer’, this mode I feel is underused at the time of writing this review but is a great feature that I believe GRID should integrate with the main multiplayer mode of future titles. There is also a global challenge that ranks your account on various tracks against world times and a full featured online mode which has typical lobby matchmaking as you would expect. With some interesting indicators for racers which prefer to drive aggressively indicated by traffic light colour exclamation marks next to their profiles. Also by purchasing the DLC you get no advantage over users who have not purchased the DLC other than the specific vehicle, and all tiers are able to be used from the start in multiplayer however if you want more cars they need to be purchased unlike the singleplayer. Grid 2 is a graphically enhanced GRID 1 with several race types such as checkpoint, time attack, endurance, face off, drift, touge, races that change each lap and regular races found in the single payer as well as the multiplayer. GRID 2 is a well-priced game to buy standalone during a sale event, do not be pressured to purchase the DLC’s on offer for this title as the content is not worth what you pay for. The free DLC of demolition derby is to be expected as it features the same tracks and cars from the previous title, but I found that the gameplay was more enjoyable for the demolition derby races than in the original GRID. The lack of cockpit view is a major letdown and detracts the simulation aspect found in the previous title. Both GRID 1 and 2 are great games and if you prefer a more Arcady family and friend gaming experience than GRID 2 is the game of choice out of the two which is an easy game to get into for beginners. Overall GRID 2 is a brilliant game that can be set apart from the previous title in ways, however there has been key gameplay features removed and missed from the original game.*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			"

												This game is not really an improvement over Race Driver: GRID, except for the graphics. This game has a number of defects including:- No cockpit view (apparently because of ""memory constraints"". Really? This is a PC game, right?)- A high chance of having zero multiplayer which still hasn't been fixed after 8 months- Cheaters in multiplayer if you are lucky enough to have it- DLC is pretty bad, seemingly just content ripped from release so you can pay extra- DLC shown during any car select so it feels like you're playing a demoThe physics are er, ...interesting. It's very drift friendly - perhaps for the younger generation - and sometimes I like this and sometimes it seems my car breaks into a slide purely at random.Singleplayer - Seems to be 90% city courses so far (I'm most of the way through tier 3) with only the occasional time trial on decent real world circuits, which might be quite a disappointment for Race Driver: GRID fans. The much hated Codemasters D0uchebag™ is alive and present in singleplayer, sounding like an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot blabbering on about social media ... I want to punch that fool. Fortunately you can tun him off which is a massive improvement over Dirt 3, where you are forced to listen to the fūckwit tell you to ""upload your video to youtube!!11!1!!"". Only things it's got going for itself is the graphics and the damage modelling. If you're looking for a sequel to GRID I suggest you look at Shift 2 Unleashed, even for all it's problems it's far superior to this.			"

												A big disappointment, particularly compared to the first GRID.  While the UI and the conceit are cool, the game is disgustingly crammed with DLC. How disgusting? The cars that ""count"" as DLC are DIFFERENT between the single player and online versions of the game.  Also, it doesn't work with my racing wheel (a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro) which did work with the original game. Playing it with a Xbox gamepad just isn't the same.On a possitive note, the racing *feels* very fast, and the maps are good, particularly the country road ones. So if you value feeling fast over anything else, this might be the racing game for you.			"

												It's a solid game, with beautiful graphics, scenery and the sound effects are very good, but it feels mainly ""arcadeish"", good for people bad in driving games (myself included). The game however has settings that add more manual handling control to the user, but the gameplay itself lacks realism. The game main campaign might look interesting for the first few races, but then it gets too repetitive,  every time it's the same venues, the tracks are just slightly different from one another when racing in the same place or are exactly the same you played on before, very poor variablility. Also, some events are ultra repetitive as you have to run in the same track over and over, and do not add anything different to the gameplay.The multiplayer part of the game is fun at first, but levelling up was taking a lot of time and made me lose interest on keeping racing on every same track all the time. Also finding a lobby with a lot of people is not an easy task, maybe this can vary with the region of the world. The good part about the multiplayer is playing with friends and laughing about the mistakes and crashes.One thing very annoying is shoving in your face the ""add-on"" cars (DLC) when you go to select your car to play. Add-on cards should only be shown if I had the cars, not telling me to purchase them. If you want to advertise it in the game, make it so in the main menu... By the way, they added a ""Reloaded"" edition, which is just the same base game with all the DLC included in a single package, another way to milk more money out of DLC.--------Portuguese translation:O jogo é bem feito, tem belos gráficos, cenários e efeitos sonoros são muito bons, mas o jogo é muito arcade, bom para o público geral que não joga bem jogos de corrida (eu incluso nisso). Porém o jogo permite configurações que permitem maior controle manual por parte do jogador, mas mesmo assim o jogo não prima em realismo. A campanha principal do jogo é interessante no início, principalmente nas primeiras corridas, mas daí em diante se torna repetitivo demais, são sempre nas mesmas cidades, os circuitos mudam muito pouco mesmo quando o modo de corrida muda, muitas vezes são os mesmos circuitos/traçados, a variedade é bem fraca. Os eventos em si também são bem repetitivos, muitas vezes você tem que correr na mesma pista várias vezes, e nada de diferente é adicionado à jogabilidade.O modo multiplayer é início no começo, mas subir de level parece muito lento e me fez perder o interesse em jogar online nos mesmos circuitos de novo toda hora. Encontrar uma sala com muita gente também não é tarefa muito fácil, de repente falta jogador se for dividido por região. O legal do multiplayer é jogar com amigos e rir dos erros e batidas.Uma coisa bem chata é ficar mostrando toda hora os carros ""add-on"" (DLC) quando você vai selecionar o seu carro pra corrida. Esses carros opcionais só deveriam ser mostrados caso o usuário tivesse a DLC, não ficar toda hora mostrando que pode comprar, é irritante. Se quer fazer propaganda faça no menu inicial... A propósito, eles lançaram uma versão ""Reloaded"" que nada mais é do que o mesmo jogo com todas as DLCs inclusas num pacote, outra forma incentivar a prática caça-níquel de DLCs.			"

													Grid 2 is yet another racing game from arcade racing specialists Codemasters and make no mistake, this is no simulation.  Racing is centred around street circuits, permanent racing venues and a few single stage like events. 	There is a wide variety of events available from straight races, time trials, checkpoint races, endurance (7 whole minutes at a time!), drift, eliminator and others.  The best of these is the “liveroutes” events that occur in one of the major cities.  The route is randomly chosen when you start a race and the mini-map is disabled resulting in you having to pay attention to the upcoming corner to judge entry speed.  Though once you have been playing the single player portion of the game for a while it does become easier as the locations while appearing huge are quite limited in how many layouts are available.	The game is absolutely beautiful though, from the various locations like Paris, Hong Kong and Barcelona to all the car models and how damage appears on them.  The game also performs admirably on even modest machines.My biggest issue with the game is how the cars drive and more importantly how the AI cars drive.  Cars come in two varieties, tail happy and not, that's about it.  Front wheel drive cars drive like front wheel drive cars, four wheel drive cars are glued to the road and for rear wheel drive it's seemingly random whether it's glued to the road or wants to head for the bushes at every corner.  This behaviour tends to drive you to only driving a couple of cars like the Caterham LMP-like track car the Audi R8 LMS.The opposition AI is also an issue.  Instead of allowing the AI to drive the track and react to conditions and you as they appear, the AI cars seem to be pre-programmed to move around the track in a certain way like robots.  It's frustrating in many ways as you end up making the same passes all the time as you quickly become aware of their weaknesses.  There are also some bizarre changes in difficulty, some races are ridiculously easy on the highest setting while others are quite hard on the lowest.  Both these criticisms could be made of just about every Codemasters racing game, maybe with the next Dirt or Grid they could concentrate on AI?All in all this is a very decent Arcade racer, it doesn't do anything new or exciting that is deserving of paying full price, but is a good way or wasting a few hours here and there.

												Game is not worth it. Anything made good in this game is lost by the fact that every AI car in the game are on rails that are harder to break than Wolverine's Bones. You can not race against them without constant annoyance. They will push and shove you out of their way like your car is made out of paper cups and they are titanium. That is on any difficulty. I would recommend Dirt3 but that is a no go as well, as it can not save. It is a dark day for driving games, a dark day indeed.			"

												An arcade racing game. Great damage simulation. Yet another racing game tells you that drift is way better than grip.娱乐爽快的赛车游戏，里面的车损系统一直是我喜欢grid系列的原因之一。游戏里面漂移比抓地过弯快，所以必须得漂移╮(╯_╰)╭......			"

												Although, It really is ALOT of fun to play, The truth of the matter is, the game have major flaws....The game saves becoming corrupted, I believe that was done by CM on purpose, just to sell the unlock pack to all the frustrated racers who would have to race with none of the cool unlocked cars. Then they ""fixed"" it.  So now, my gamesave file is corrupt again, and there is no way to fix it. Well, the 68.00 + tx  I spent on this game thus far, seems to be wasted money..DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. When I complained on a thread made by one of the developers re: VAC being intigrated into GRID 2, I fired of a comment""Are you going to corrupt our gamesaves, and sell us VAC like u did with the UNLOCK PACK.?""Now, before I posted, comments were coming in at around, 1 per 4 to 5 hours. 10 mins after I posted, 15 comments in 10 minutes, and NOT 1 had anything to do with my comment. The next morning. Codemasters deleted the tread, and moved all feedback to the forums, so they can instantly edit out comments that they dont like. And I know this sounds paranoid, But my gamesave didnt corrupt for the 2nd time, until I posted a VERY similar comment on a steam freinds profile.I am openly and publicly calling CODEMASTERS out.YOU SCAMMED US, AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!!!!-the worst part is. I really liked that game. Id recommend D/L a torrent, You wont have multiplayer, but with the gamesave issue, your only saving yourself the heart ache of losing all your work, and just when it get good, the game save corrupts...

												In my opinion, the game is worth it if it's under $20.  I've been a active racer for this game since day one.  I've preordered it on Steam because it had the best DLC bundle compared to the console counterparts.  The only DLC packs that matter are the mclaren pack, the mercedes pack, and the gt-r pack in my opinion.  Since there were a lot of folks that pre-ordered it too, you'll be able to use those cars on a regular basis in the public lobbies.  Both the Mclaren and Mercedes DLC cars for TIER 4 are the ONLY upgradeable ones.  You can not upgrade any other DLC cars.  Also, the GT-R pack is good because it gives you a good option to be competative in Tier 3 when you are starting out as a low level driver.As far as multiplayer goes, just make sure you set your download region to a European server (since the game is region-locked).  If you are looking forward to drift mode like the one from GRID 1, then be prepared to be let down.  Because of the new physics engine, it's nothing like it's predecessor.  But I like the racing portion a lot though.  The reason why I liked the GRID 1 was because all the cars had the SAME SPECS.  So the only thing that defines the winner is skill and the racing lines the driver takes to get to the top.  With the upgrade customization aspect thrown into the mix in GRID 2,  it's now about which setup get's you the best performance in the car along with what lines you take.  As you meet faster racers, you'll learn what are the best setups for the best car in each tier or, for me, the best setup for your driving style.  Add in the ""active obstactle"" for the mental game of how are you going to pass this racer cleanly for an extra challenge.  Also, if you are pretty confident in your skills and are in a room full of noobs, you can challenge yourself by giving the noobs a 10 second head start.

												Want a good racing game? Get original GRID, want a game you won't be able to complete unless you buy all dlc, get this! It's easier than original was, and yet it feels harder, almost all cars you get trough career are drifters (even the ones that really shouldn't be) So you will have a really hard time finishing some races without buying a good dlc pack :(			"

												I have not played a lot of racing games on pc, but I can say Grid 2 is one of the best I have tried. I hear a lot of complaints about it being not realistic enough, but for me that's just fine (after all my favorite racing series is the F Zero series). I have not played its predecessor but I can say that I do enjoy Grid 2 quite a bit. I am having trouble putting into words what I like about Grid 2, after all I cant even describe what sets it apart from other racing games. I can say however, that I have not noticed anything ""wrong"" with the game per se. It ran good for me, it was easy to learn, and it was fun to play, and in the end, are those not the most important aspects of a game? I cant tell you why you should be interested in Grid 2, but if you are a fan, you've got to at least give it a look. I cant guarantee you wont be disappointed. But you will never know until you try.			"

												One of the best racing games I have ever played!Really nice gameplay, cars, controls, graphics. Also runs amazing on laptop chips :)The story mode is great and the multiplayer is fun too, the only dowside can be the car styling but its not a big deal.You should really consider geting this if you are a fan of racing games but also if you like games with ""speed"", like going really fast. It really feels like you are in the car in this game and to be honest it feels great!This game is also very realistic on the crashes, it really looks like a real car that has been damaged.Is ths game worth buying at full price? Yes it is!Will it run on a older pc? Yeah it will, actually runned at medium/high settings on my laptop.1-10? 9/10 :)			"

Grabbed a copy of Grid 2 Reloaded to check out some fantastic racing fun. $19.25 tax in with a bunch of DLC so I figured I couldn't go wrong.It might not be the latest and greatest graphics, but I think it's a solid racer you can spend a few hrs messing around in it and having some fun. I am enjoying the career mode so far.7.8/10

												Don't get me wrong, this game had potential but just has some major issues that make it almost unplayable.- HandingThe cars handle like complete crap and are either boaty as♥♥♥♥♥♥or so sensative you can't drive in a straight line. The cars spin so freaking easily and its impossible to overcome a spin or control it. If you so much as touch someone, you spin, if you touch a wall you spin, if you do anything you spin. Trying to drift is nearly impossible, as soon as you start to slide, it's like a bar of soap sliding on the bottom of a wet bath tub. Honestly phone racing games have better handling this. 3/10- PerformanceI don't know if this is my own fault, or what but after playing the game for 10 hours the performance decided to jump off a cliff and I know it's not me playing on a weak PC, I play Shift 2 above 60 fps no issue at all on max. If it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, the graphics would be really good. 4/10- DifficultyI don't want to play a game that is so easy you dust everyone, but damn its nearly impossible to win even if the game didn't have the ♥♥♥♥♥iest handling ever. If all of the AI have the same car as you, they are still way faster in all ways despite them owning the EXACT same car as you. It makes winning more of a hassle than fun, you end up restarting the event over and over again until either you wreck one of the AI or they do something stupid and you get extremly lucky. 2/10If you want a nice looking track racing game, just get Shift 2, it's a lot better and cheaper, you even get all the DLCs for free.

												This game has fantastic graphics even on a laptop with very average specs. I like almost everything about it, except the handling. It's a huge drift fest. The developers decided that drifting around corners going 180 km/h is a good idea. I've played other racing games before, but simply had no luck with this one because the cornering physics is so different. I could train myself to handle the cars this way, but I don't want to change my habits for just one game.Mind you, this IS an ARCADE STYLE racing game. I shouldn't have been expecting realism. If you like more realistic handling (i.e. actually braking before cornering), try Grid Autosport. I bought this game with all the DLC, wish I could get all the money back but it's too late. I really want to like this game, and I had some good times with it in the beginning, but soon I realised that it's not meant for me.			"

												Bought on sale after loving GRID I was hoping for something good but came away disappointed. The cars and graphics are nice enough. Now on the bad bits. The menu system is akward and ends up intrusive to the game overall, instead of letting you get the best of it. That could be lived with if it was not for the biggest issue this game has. It lacks the visceral experience of a RACE compared to the original. This is down to cars feeling unpredictable/non linear in their behaviour. During gameplay there is an unmistakable feeling of driving aids being too overpowering. They don't make the game fun by taking care of a the odd blunder, they smother it sadly. All of the above was evident from the first few minutes of gameplay, I persevered for the sake of the game for 6 hours of total gameplay. In the end I am sad to say this is a game you should 100% avoid if you want a fun and thrilling racing experience. This is not on a sim or arcade spectrum. The core gameplay just does not work here... The original GRID left me thrilled, this just furstrated			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game to any one after finishing the career mode.So this is the 2nd of the GRID series. It has better music and better graphics. A race in Algave on a sunny day is really beautiful. A richer car list than GRID, including those breathtaking racing cars and those flashing super or hyper car. The idea of WSR is also great, getting drivers from all over the world, from different clubs, having different driving style to race rogether is great fun.But seriously, because you're the post boy of WSR, and your job is to attract those racers to take part in WSR, you'll have no chance to take part in 24h Le Mans. And for this you're saying goodbye to those stunning prototypes, which is a great lost for me. Well they left me a SP300R though.So since I won't recommend this game to anyone else, how imperfect it is? Well, the career mode, I'd devide it into three parts, the boring part I like a game of NFS, the best second part and the total nightmare of the third part. Why is that? The cars in this game are divided in to three types: grip, balanced and drift. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem is, GRID2 didn't have a right idea of drfting, and made drfting literally spinning. It's alright at first, when your cars are always slow so you can remain in control. But that makes it feel like NFS. When you're going into Europe, grip type of cars appear. You'll find them funny to drive, with sometimes a little bit of slide, you'll have a lot of fun in driving. But when it comes to the later part of the game, especially when you have those Tier 4 super car. The spin on those super car becomes uncontrollable, so when you are racing in HongKong or Co d'Azure, you'll have to go carefully (and slowly) to avoid spinning and crashing. And even worse, only one of the super cars is grip type. The problem is caused by the poor physics of this game, like everyone else said.And then, BOTs. Thanks to spinning, the Koenisegg Agera R is literally undrivable. But, you'll find out those BOTs will drive this car like a gust of wind, no crashing, no spinning and don't even slide! And like GRID, BOTs of GRID2 like crashing too. That Bruno Silva guy, before the race the radio will tell you he's so agressive and always crashing others, so he hit me, well, I can't blame anyone because they warned me the guy was dangerous. But when they tell me Eliminaciόn drivers are afraid of trade paint, those guys still crashed on me. My face was like ""dafaq"" as I was spinning. So since those BOTs made you so upset, why not spin them out or crash them out of track to take some revenge? No, you won't move them a little bit. If they crash you, you'll spin, and if you crash them, you'll spin too! And in two racing type the BOTs made themselves boss there. One of them is touge. In touge competitor will take penalty for hitting other driver. But in GRID2 it's directly disqualified. And here is the problem. If you crash them, you'll get disqualified, that's the rule. But if they crash you, you're still getting disqualified. Simple. The other one is drifting race. Drifting race is literally a series of jokes in GRID2. Just get behind one of your competitor and see how they drive and you'll find out that it's no even sliding, just driving fast through every corner like a normal race. And when you get to the finish you'll find out that they still have a decent score for that. Drifting itself is a joke in GRID2, drifting race is a series of jokes.In career mode you can test drive your cars. But it's only one lap only in Indianpolis. So in real life it's reasonable because those race track will charge you for using their tracks. If you don't have much money you won't be able to go like 10 laps on the track. But come on! If you can't drive those racing car on the race track freely, why are you still playing it? Are we playing a race manager simulator rather than a  race driver simulator, if it ever is?And, well, no Nürburgring, even worse.5/10, for the middle part of the career mode is a lot fun.			"

												A game with a splendid visual work. As well for tracks, cities, landscapes or cars, although the choice of Japanese and American is excessive. Here, neither Porsche, Ferrari, nor Lamborghini, etc. (And Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo or other AMG against which you run in WSR, are not available in DLC) But the principal critic to do to this game, it's that instead of being called “GRID 2”, it should be called “DRIFT 2” so much ALL the cars drift, in spite of medium settings. Some are almost impossible to handle, like Ford Sierra 500, Pagani Zonda Revolucion, McLaren MP4-12C, Honda NSX-R or Koenigsegg CCGT. Even the Dallara Indy with its slick tires drifts ! What is incredible for Racing Cars which should remain like on rails ! But at the opposite, others cars are totally understeer like the three types of Nissan GTR, the Ford UTE or the brilliant Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (With these cars, take care to the size choice of your rims !) And let's not speak about the non-existent braking of almost all the cars except this little fabulous Subaru Impreza, the ridiculous engine sound of some, or the too low top speed of others. Only 223 MpH for the CCGT and 214 for the Dallara : a bad surprise, because normaly these cars exceed 250 MpH ! And for the “OnLine Races"", better is to forget. It's Stock-Car between furious insane, not of the Automobile race...Un jeu avec un travail visuel magnifique, que ce soit pour les voitures, les circuits, les villes ou les paysages, bien que le choix des Japonaises et Américaines soit excessif. Ici, ni Porsche, ni Ferrari, ni Lamborghini, etc. (Et les Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo et autres AMG contre lesquelles on court en WSR, ne sont pas disponibles en DLC) Mais le principal reproche que je ferais à ce jeu, c'est qu'au lieu de s'appeller ""Grid 2"", il devrait s'appeller ""Drift 2"" tellement  TOUTES les voitures dérapent malgré des réglages medium. Certaines sont quasiment inconduisibles, comme la Ford Sierra 500, la Pagani Zonda Revolucion, la McLaren MP4-12C, la Honda NSX-R ou la Koenigsegg CCGT. Même la Dallara Indy avec ses pneus slicks, dérape ! Ce qui est un comble pour des Voitures de Course qui devraient rester sur des rails ! Mais à l'opposé, d'autres voitures sont totalement sous-vireuses comme les trois types de Nissan GTR, la Ford UTE ou la géniale Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (Avec ces bagnoles, faites gaffe au choix de la taille de vos jantes !) Et ne parlons pas du freinage inexistant de presque toutes les voitures excepté de cette fabuleuse petite Subaru Impreza, du ridicule son-moteur de certaines, ou de la trop basse vitesse de pointe d'autres. Seulement 360 KmH pour la CCGT et 345 pour la Dallara : une mauvaise surprise, parce que normalement ces voitures dépassent les 400 KmH ! Quant aux ""courses en Ligne"", mieux vaut oublier. C'est du Stock-Car entre fous furieux, pas de la Course Automobile...			"

												Overall a good game, but there a some points that are incredibly annyoing after a while. The Handling is everything but realistic. You always start at the back, that mean you have to overtake the slow KI which is constantly blocking you on small tracks. The KI in first place wins distance in this time and its just luck when you have enough time in the last lap to overtake him. Then if you touch another Car, yours instantly loses control and you have to shift back. If another car touches you the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing happens. Feels like that their cars weight like 3tons and yours 200kg.			"

I did and, besides the lower quality graphics, the overall experience is way better, a lot closer to one of my favorite racing games: Shift Unleashed.So, if you empathize with this review, you should try GRID, being advised it's a little outdated, but still fun.

												You think that you play Grid, but people think that they play Burnout! Instead of going faster, and turning smoother; majority of people on multiplayer prefer to hit you in the back and make you go full 360. The sad part is that there is no way to punish these players in-game! They ruin your Grid experience, and gain advantage of that! Codemasters does not do anything about it, the game does not have publisher support. Singleplayer is fun though, but multiplayer is nothing more than rage control.			"

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.

												GRID 2 is the successor of the great GRID, one of the first titles of the genre to popularize in the current generation of consoles. The game franchise's debut game impressed by presenting cutting-edge graphics and good gameplay. The most highlighted in the title was the amazing effect of speed that the game offered players. Upon reaching certain levels of speeds, the vehicle presented light bumps and a beginning of a lack of control in every wrong move could result in a spectacular collision.In this way, the Codemasters started to become a reference in the genre, which eventually finalized with the release of titles like DiRT 3 and the official Formula 1 games. The downside of all this is that before games so well accepted by critics and by the players, GRID 2 hits the market with a greater good than other games of the producer.Fortunately, the company has done the homework and, on top of a new engine, brought practically the same game with minor improvements. What makes the game a must-have for fans of the genre, even in the final stretch of this generation of consoles.Grid 2 offers a lot of speed and game modesFetching the popularizing of your eventGRID 2 focuses on the evolution of the pilot in a competition, the WSR, which seeks to become a known event. For this, it is necessary to popularize the attraction, attracting more fans with incredible feats, how to win duels and disputadíssimas evidence. Every amount reached by public, create more evidence and the event gets even more prominence, even with calls on television shows. Of course it's a joke of a partnership between the company and an American sports channel.And just as in the first game, you must also fulfill objectives imposed by sponsors, ranging from finished the race in a given place, to perform feats within a race, how to overcome a certain number of opponents. Fulfilling these goals, more evidence and vehicles are released.Incredible variety of game modesGRID 2 has an amazing range of modalities that are part of both the main mode, when descompromissadas evidence. They are:Race common race mode where WINS who arrives in frontAgainst the clock race against the clock where you need to score the best time of the trackPopular Drift mode skid, where every you need slippage accumulates point. Add WINSElimination Proof in that every 20 seconds, the last placed is eliminatedOverdrive Exceed the maximum of opponents, without colisòes, to score pointsTougue Wins who open more than 5 second advantage over his opponent firstConfrontation Duels against an opponent where WINS who arrives in frontControl point Run to achieve the maximum possible checpoints and add a few seconds to your time. WINS who spend more time on the track.Resistance test with a particular overtime. WINS who is at first when this time finishEven so, none of them have so much prominence when the mode in which the path becomes totally random. That is, the player doesn't have a map and the straights and curves appear in a way unexpected. This requires a cautious and riding at the same time a lot of reflection.Pilotage in that you dictate the paceThe GRID 2 gameplay remains the high point of the game. Despite not running at 60 frames per second, it features movements which depict very well the realism of disputes at high speed, with a great progression of difficulty. In other words, while at the beginning of your journey, the cars, the tracks and the opponents are not terrifying, as the progress of the game, his skill is increasingly required, both to stay on the right path, how to get in front.Another interesting point of the game is the player's freedom to fly in their strokes. There are all kinds of curves for various vehicles, in this way, it is up to the player to opt for boldness or by doing the basics. That is, every moment you can decide by simply attacking a curve, requiring the maximum of brakes and tires, or just get around it the safest way possible-of course there are exceptions to everything, and some curves require much more accurate movements.The greatest proof of this freedom is the absence of the already popular auxiliary line. Virtually all racing games released in this generation include the famous coloured line showing the ideal stroke. With his absence in GRID 2, back to the old and traditional custom of get to know better the path before to master certain clues. But if the player still find some difficulty-or making a big error-replay mode, which remains intact, can be activated. It allows players to go back up to a certain point of the race, and can change their past movements.Visually, GRID 2 is even more beautiful			"

												Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I can't even believe the♥♥♥♥♥♥that Codemasters is trying to pull by having made this game. This is literally a downgrade from Grid 1. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing stunned that this is even a game. Pros:looks niceCons:.Driving physics are stripped down and completely different resulting in a straight downgrade from the first game      .the handling is too sensitive. you drift simply by turning hard enough and the game has nothing but hairpin turns      .You HAVE to use the brake instead of the E-brake to drift.drifting is god awful.Simplified hud.default controller layout is changed for no reason and is worse. .Blatant advertising.dated references     .Seriously the first achievement you get is a reference to a 3-year old pop song. It's only going to get more dated as time goes on. .linear story mode     .Some♥♥♥♥♥♥is constantly yammering in my ear and attempting to stroke my ego while simultaneously screaming about     some stupid competition that I care nothing about and then proceeds to explain it to me like I've never played a racing game or watched a racing movie. .announcer/coach that holds your hand and patronizes you every step of the way no matter how bad you mess up.Forced account signup for some stupid network you're never gonna use.no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit view.NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RACE DAY MODE     This is probably the worst part about the game. I could handle all of the above. Even the inferior handling but when you can't even stop the campaign to enjoy some laps by yourself and trying out new cars then it's not even worth playing. I don't know of any racing game and I sure as hell don't know any racing sims that doens't have a test track mode. -3/10. I paid next to nothing for this game and I still regret it.			"

												One of the most disappointing racing games for me. The first GRID was incredible and had a more semi-sim feeling to it where as GRID 2 is 100% arcade, something that is very unlike what Codemasters have been doing since the first Race Driver. The sponsors function has been changed completely, very dumbed down. And the absence of a decent monetary system is very disappointing. There's nothing left of what made the first GRID great.Thanks Codemasters for ruining a great game.			"

												I'm a pretty huge fan of racing games in general, and to be honest, I've played most of them too, whether it be forza, dirt, gran turismo, test drive, need for speed... you get the point. This game is truely up there with the rest. Codemasters have made yet another awesome title, however I can't stop thinking its Dirt on asphalt, the driving mechanics are very similar to Dirt, however they are very different to that of other racing games. To be honest, i'm not complaining tho, the driving is much smoother than most racing games and can become quite enjoyable after a while.GRID 2 provides an awesome variety of maps and enviroments from places in USA, Europe and Asia. Not to mention the cars, there is more than enough to choose from for each season and the difficulties are neither too hard, too easy... but just right, compared to that of Dirt 3 (way too easy).Although it may not have the open world gameplay of test drive unlimited, or the graphics in forza and it is hardly an improvement multiplayer, but with aggressive AI and enjoyable handling, Codemasters ensure that this game is always challeging, and there is more than enough hours of fun packed within this game.

												I really wish there was a better rating system on Steam than just yes or no.. i would give this game a 5/10.The CONS just out-weigh the PROS for me. That being said its still an enjoyable fun game.PROS:>Very polished, optimized game. would probably run on a laptop on medium-ish settings and still look great!>Beautiful Graphics, Seriously better than the first GRID's graphics and even those were really good in 07.>Fantastic Damage model for all cars! this could almost pass for ""Soft body Physics"".CONS:>Boring compared to the first one, seriously gets boring when you travel to Europe.>crappy car list compared to the first game, a lot of missing car classes (no Open-wheel, DTM, GT, LMP and no Le Mans). it starts out like the first one and i was excited. I won muscle car after muscle car, then when you travel to Europe you get crappy Econo-box  tier cars i wouldn't be seen dead in like: Subaru BRZ, Ford Focus ST, Alfa Romeo Giulietta and a freaking Hyundai Genesis!!! a Hyundai!!! why?? all that Econo-box list is missing is a Kia Soul!! The only exciting cars you will get in Europe is the Volkswagen Golf R, or the few BMWs you get.... >they want you to buy the better cars in various over priced DLC packs...>CRAPPY HANDLING PHYSICS. Okay, this one is my biggest complaint over this game since this was FINE in the first GRID, and also what made me give it a ""Not Recommended"" rating. They made it so that you may as well drift around every corner, its the fastest way to get around any corner! don't get me wrong, i love drifting, but this is advertised as a racing sim. NOT EVERY CAR SHOULD SLIDE AROUND A CORNER LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF INITIAL D AT THE SLIGHTEST TAP OF THE BREAK CODEMASTERS! No lie, you can seriously fly around a corner faster than any competition by just tapping the E-break, even in ""grip"" or ""balanced"" type cars. Its more of a challenge to race properly and grip the road, this is just silly...For me GRID 2 is a bit of a let down since the first one, and also i grew up playing Codemaster's games like Colin McRae. I still enjoy playing it in small bursts. The CONS just out-weigh the PROS for me to be able to fairly give it a ""Recommended"", i wish i could give it a ""Its Ok"" rating,			"

												As an arcade racer sure, it is decent and can be fun. However I was hoping for something closer to NFS Shift 2, a game that has the heart of a Sim racer with a bit more accessibility. The driving feels very drifty and exaggerated and is easier to manage with a gamepad controller then it is with a racing wheel. The biggest gripe I have is the omission on the cockpit view, it makes me just not want to play the game at all. My second biggest Gripe is the way DLC is handled. The game feels more like a F2P pay2win game where all the best parts are behind a pay wall. The base game comes with enough to get by but why do I need to pay more to race with my favorite car or on my favorite track. It is just a shame.			"

The game is linear and you have no choice where to race. The roads are lined with walls and hitting them seem to be integrated into the game.

												Grid 2 is a game which tries too many different things and does most of them poorly. The biggest disappointment here for most Codies fans will be the driving physics, which are laughable. When you realise drifing round a corner is faster than braking and clipping the apex, the game immediately loses any shine.It looks good enough, but the huge amount of street courses versus the comparatively few road courses and the shonky driving model make for a pretty bland experience. Little bugs here and there once again dent the presentation, which - like DiRT - gets caught up in big name sponsors instead of focusing on the driving itself.A lack of a cockpit view is the final nail in the coffin for Grid 2. Very disappointing experience.			"

I mean come on! you crash on them with 270km, you get tossed like <3 <3 <3 <3 and they are just keep going like nothing happened AND NO DAMAGES? really? The maps .. All the same, no matter what mode you play. 5-6 areas with a biiiiiiiit modified tracks.The ""freezing"" because of enviromental lightning.. Doesn't matter how high or low you have your graphics. Doesn't matter if it's Intel or AMD. IT WILL FREEZE for a few miliseconds that will propably ruin your race especialy online.The car handling. The whole thing was bad. where are those awesome ORIGINAL GRID settings for realistic driving? They don't even have the HEAD VIEW option.Now for the online mode.This was the worst. The menus.. You have to click in damn LOT choices to just enter an event.. You need to exit a party to change car settings or get new unlocks or upgrade cars -means you will lose that party, take it's sweet time to find new-. The car menu was poorly designed.. To upgrade cars you kept needed to move up and down on riddiculus selections, to swich between cars you need to do all over menu browse from start.. ReALLY?Second most stupid thing online.. CHEATERS .. yep just like dirt or f1 we have a lots of those here .. nothing more to say. And ofcourse that there is no penalty for those who are just playing to crash on you so their ""pals"" can get the flag. THIS IS NO <3<3<3ING DIRT!My opinion, get GRID 1 if you want a really good racing game.. with a LOT of tracks and cars again, with NO need for stupid upgrates.. Just get money and buy cars.. Just no online games there. lan and splitscreen are still available.			"

												Truth be told, it isn't the best when it comes to the amount of content featured: 50 ish cars and less than 20 tracks, not including the layouts, as well as stupidly overpriced DLC just for (mostly) modified versions of existing cars.It also handles almost nothing like the original Race Driver: GRID. Any car can drift, even Grippy-type ones, with some handbrake persuasion. About the only thing that's improved instead of replaced is the damage modelling. Frankly, Codemasters should've renamed the game if the only thing keeping it in touch with the original GRID is the premise of tackling multiple motorsport disciplines, from straight up races to touges.Visually, there's no denying it; GRID 2 looks beautiful, and for once I accept the large amounts of lens flare and lens grime, only because there is no true Dashboard Camera. This game really doesn't need it anyway.Sound design is also amazingly well done. It's quite rare to see a racing game do the Skyline R34 engine and exhaust sounds as close to the real thing as it gets, and then there's the tunnels and terrain echoing.Career mode offers varied racing disciplines, and the multiplayer is very solid, but it all depends on your ability to look past the changed features, little content and LACK OF COCKPIT VIEW *grrrr* for an otherwise pure racing experience.

												For someone like me, (who loves Codemasters' games as well as the orginal GRID) the standard version of GRID 2 is dissapointing and deviates from what made the original game so good. I really want to praise the fantastic visuals, incredible sound design, with impressive roster of cars and a decent online multiplayer, but there are some glaring problems. I could go on about the horrible americanised story, which is tedious and dull. I could do a rant on the 'Truefeel' handling system that robs the car's identity when driving and I could rage about the omission of the cockpit view, but these aren't the true reasons why, I just can't in good faith, give this game the recommended verdict.   The actual reasoning is it's DLC, which is FAR too overpriced. At £25 for all the DLC you get the following:- 5 Tracks (15 routes). - 24 Cars (2 liveries).- A 15% discount on every in-game purchase in online multiplayer.- Instant access to every online car.(This doesn't include the free demoliton derby game mode)That may seem much, but as the game is £20, it's far less value, while creating a massive player disconnect in the multiplayer.Overall if you like GRID stay the hell away from this, and wait for GRID Autosport. This is too much of a cash grab that tarnishes the GRID name. 5/10   "

TL/DR REVIEW: MediocreGRID 2 is a very arcady racer. Multiplayer is dead, singleplayer is not that great in my opinion. I guess the events and fan system is kind of cool, but the actual racing with AI in this game is not good in my opinion. The game bored me quickly. If you just want a simple, casual arcady (no problem with that) racing game with decent graphics, this might be for you. But for me it's just very mediocre.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

It's not that bad to give up playing it, still, you can have a bit of fun playing online with your friend.Not a proper sequel, absolutley.The Grid series was a good arcade-simulator series, getting pretty close to being a simulator (Not comparing to Gran Turismo, because it's a true simulator and Grid is not near that, but pretty close). Race Driver: Grid was a pretty neat racing game, that was all about motorsport and very realsitic physics. But then cames out the second one and gives motorsport a middle finger.Pros:+Good graphics and optimization. Game looks and runs very good on Intel HD graphics, which sounds a little bit odd.+light-hearted fun in multiplayer. If you, of course, playing it with a friend, not a random group of people.Cons:-Arcade physics. The thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most. You have to bloody drift in order to get through a tight corner, and if your car doesn't drift, you can always corner with a wall. In Race driver: Grid you spin all over the place if you do drift, but here, you HAVE to drift. The more appropriate title for this game is: ""NFS: Codemasters edition"".-No real motivation to do anything. (I'm sorry if i've missed something during career mode) In the first one you had money, here you have fans that don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥-Everybody drives like crazy. That's why i don't like to play it with some random people. Everybody is trying their hardest for you to fail, bashing into walls, bashing into you, bashing into a wall and make a great wall of cars, that is impossible not to hit and etc.Summary:Not a good game, arcade physics, DLCs that don't make any sense (exept for the one where you get a Koennigseg CCGT),and overall, the game doesnt make any sense, with an autosport series. If you like it -  go ahead, enjoy it, but personally, i prefer the first one and Grid Autosport.			"

I don't think so.So, let's kick it off with the new things. The things they added.- The LiveTrack. 100% unrealistic, painful if you like to know the tracks you are racing on, the LiveTrack is used for classic races or Endurance... Speaking of which:- Endurance mode. Basically, it's a fancy name to try and make you believe it's also brand new, when it's really just a race that ends at a specific time rather than a specific line.- Story. Let's face it, the first GRID was minimalist, story speaking. But it also didn't need it, and the lack of it - or the small presence of it - didn't bother me. This time, however, there is a scenario. This time, you are building the WSR, the World Series Racing. Some cinematics, some (fake) coverage by ESPN... It definitely feels more alive.Now, for the things they modified or deleted.- Cameras. No more interior camera - which is a shame, we'll admit it - and, more importantly, totally trashed up TV cameras - taking away all the value of the replays. No really, replaying your best drifts on GRID was like watching 2 Fast 2 Furious, in GRID2 it feels like the cameraman browses /r/trees on a daily basis.- Teammate. It was fun, knowing your fellow crew member was out there, helping you out on the track, pushing opponents out of the track, stealing the first place and apologizing deeply when he finished last. Now, all you have is the guy talking to you since day 1 (but you still don't know who it is) and complaining he'll have to mend your car when you wreck it.- The Drifting. It's hard to explain. But the drifting in GRID felt a hundred times better. Firstly, you were alone on the track, without stupid people pushing you out of the way because they forgot which race category they were in. Secondly, the vibe was astonishing - the japanse speakerman going crazy over your moves, the crowd... And lastly, it just felt more responsive. The combo system was nice and clear, the way the car drifted was purely arcade but so enjoyable...- No more rep/money system. GRID2 brings in the ""fan system"", already seen in Blur, for example. - Aaaaaand the way the sponsors work changed too. And this time, it clearly is below what GRID offered.That's not all, these are just the things that pop out first when I think about it. Now, the graphics are really nice, there are plenty of cars to choose from, and the tracks are still interesting. So ?1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIt's probably still better to grab it while it's on sale - hint: it's really cheap - but if you like arcade racing, and/or the first GRID, well, go for it.

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.Best Game Moment: Aggressively drifting round a final corner to take first place and win a championship.

												This isn't a sim, but neither was the first Grid game. What this is, is tons of fun. And not to mention, the graphics are absolutely stunning. I really like the courses as well. On city streets, and windy, country roads. There is just the right amount of grip and slip that just feels good with a Xbox controller. I say if you want realism. Go race a real car because no sim is going to give you G forces. I'm deffenetly going to spring some extra for the DLC.			"

												Short version: Not anywhere as good as Grid 1, but still a fun $5 for a racing game.  Multiplayer is pretty inactive & the DLC is mostly stupid.Long version:I was a huge Grid 1 fan, and at first play this game disappointed me at how different it is.  Grid 1 wants you to turn corners carefully, 2 wants you to drift drift drift all the time.  It's very arcadey & far from the sim based racer 1 is.  Multiplayer servers aren't very active, I think people have moved on to Autosport & other games.  I really hate the corner cutting ""feature"", its punishment enough when you accidentally go over gravel or grass, I don't need an additional penalty for a mistake.The maps get pretty old, even though they have you race on different sections of the same area.  The later parts of the game get really hard because the tier4 cars are nigh uncontrollable.  I had better times in the slower tier2 cars than I did the 200 mph+ tier4 cars because I crash at every turn in the tier3/4 cars.One thing this game did well was a variety of gametypes.  As opposed to just race, drift & head to head from 1, it added checkpoint, overtake, time attack & togue.As a comparison to Grid 1, it's very inferior.  As a cheap racing game, it's fun enough.Overall verdict: 7.2/10			"

												Wow at the time I got this game I thought it was awsome, its finally for the right priceas a racing fan I was let down that I cannot use my wheel to drive this game due to the reason of the view, it was a very big deal to many people to feel like you're in a car but that didn't come with grid 2 which was a letdown, some might say the originals was much better but this is fun too, The Dlc cars are super POWERFUL and you'll pretty much own everyone, Drifting was extremly hard in this game and well it felt good at time but at the same time it felt unatural.This game has+  Graphics are great+ The sound  is fantastic very realistic.+ Adrenaline pumping racing+ Theres alot of different gameplay modes you can do+ Multiplayer is smooth runs smooth+20 dollars or below is a reasonable price.- Not many customization on your vehicle and lack of it- Lots of people hated it because of the view, missing COCKPIT view was taken out of the game, very big deal for racers who wants immersion- DLC cars are overpowered- Drifting feels unsatisfying - game feels more arcadey this time around			"

												Like all racing titles from Codemasters, this one is another piece of crap. If you want a good racing sim, pick one from EA or Atari. You start with an undriveable car, that won`t make a curve if your life depended on it. That makes the game very frustrating. In terms on UI, this game is also a fail. Is most parts of the game, the only option to exit the game is to use ALT+F4. The ESC key won't always work and there is no way to skip the painfully long and slow cinematics. From a scale of 0-10, this game gets a very round ZERO.			"

Game was played on Hard6/10Pros- Great graphics- Good selection of cars- Nice tracks- Lengthy game(20+ hours)- Game feels ""real"" compared to Grid 1- Circuit races and sprints are very satisfying and provide a good amount of challenge- Can run smoothly on weak/medium PCsCons- AI is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ some cars are almost impossible to beat while the rest try to slow you down- Drifting sucks- Your car becomes unstable at high speeds. CPU can cruise the tight corners easily.- NO RACING LINE- Inconsistent difficulty- Grip cars feel uselessRace Driver Grid was a fantastic game, but in terms of driving it felt quite similar to the Need for Speed series. It feels more arcadey than realistic. Grid 2 on the other hand did a better job of making the game feel real. You can't just hit the pedal and force your car to turn. You have to find the right moment to brake and accelerate. The game feels much better in terms of circuit racing or sprints. You actually have to fight all the way to get to the number 1 spot. In Grid 1 it was quite easy to get to 1st. There are lots of cars as well, and they are classified as one of the three : Balanced, Drift or Grip. In my entire playtime I don't think I have ever used a Grip car for a race, unless I had no choice and the game forced me to use it. You're going to have to drift a lot in Grid 2, and some grip cars suck at drifting. Speaking of drifting, it sucks in this game. Grid 1 absolutely nailed drifting. It was perfect. Now drifting here is a 30 second track and no customizations. Plain horrible. It tried to go Japanese since most drift races are on mountain passes.The game still has no racing line, which can become crucial in those difficult tracks for the Vehicle Challenges on the higher tiers. There were 3 difficult challenges where the racing line would have helped significantly. The Jaguar at Hong Kong, the Benz at Okutama and the Pagani Huayra challenge. Cars also become unstable at high speeds while other cars can just stick to the ground and not slide. I've seen this several times already. I forcefully rammed a CPU car and took a 10 second lead, but he was able to catch up and beat me on the last corner. I've seen his style and even with the car he should not be able to just accelerate through corners at that speed. Don't be surprised if you see the CPUs blast through chicanes at 250km/hr without slowing down. It's a good game, but I can't recommended it. A lot of race types just suck and the circuit races and sprints are the only fun ones.			"

Moding posible ""only for singleplayer aloved"" !I give it a 10/10 as i never get any problems with it , spent a lot of hours playing it and enjoyed every second on it.Bad on it is only if you play MP with a bad looby where you catch a lot Rammer's and not skilled driver's , but this is not a codemaster's fail !

												Looks good. Everything else is S.H.I.T.E.When  you think NFS Underground 2 or Carbod had bad physics, think again. This one is BAD.Game should be called DRIFT, not GRID. i mean even effing 4by4 subaru or lancer is spinning and drifting on every corner, and god forbid you to touch the wall, u will be making 360 turn x10 times in no time. Flip the car over the roof x50 times - no problem, just touch that curb at slow speed.But man, graphics are good.Grid Online menu is crap. All those tiers and how to join particular game level? Dunno. VERY CONFUSING MENUS.Online challenges are fun. Weekly rivals WTF??!!!!! Finding online game is like finding Nemo (proably less sun tho).What else? oh, music - fine , good soundtrack.Make sure you turn off Voice volume, really those comments are annoying (but that goes to every Codemasters game, like DIRT, etc.)6/10 overall, and really just bought it because sales.played Grid 1 ages ago, but cant rememer it being so bad. Was it?anyway, this one is probably worth 12 bucks with all DLC.or was it too much Forza for me over last few years :)))))Gonna try Grid Autosport, see what its like. "

Though the landscapes are gorgeous, some of the car damage should have been more detailed. The AI is hit or miss from race to race with some of the races being super easy while others will have you restarting the race until uttter frustration sets in.Also the 'fan' counter gets old real fast esp when you cant skip it.All in all 5/10.

												GRID 2 is an arcade racing game made for players using a gamepad or their keyboard. If you want a realistic racing game, you should not buy GRID 2. I was very disappointed... I preordered it for 35,99€ and I have to say it was a waste of money. Because of that preordering I received a free copy of GRID 1, which was a big reason for me buying the game, because I really liked the car physics and graphics of GRID 1 at that time. Do not get me wrong, I still think GRID 1 is an excellent racing game! Actually it is the best I have ever played. I just can't understand what codemasters tried to do with GRID 2, I just don't get it...I played the first part of GRID and GRID 2 is a totally different game. GRID 1 had a cockpit view, which does NOT exist in GRID 2! For me personally the cockpit view is one of the most important things to make a racing game realistic. The developers said they invested much time in making the cars behave realistic on the asphalt. They failed miserably... Every car feels the same. There is no real difference. Drifting is totally unrealistic. If you want to drift you just have to fastly turn the wheel to one side, then turn it back to the other side and you are drifting. Normally when you're drifting in a realistic racing game or in reality itself you should lose time, but not in GRID 2. It feels like you always have to drift to maintain your speed. So many good game modes (drift-challenge, touge, profi-touge etc.) from GRID 1 are just left out completely in GRID 2. They tried to put a story into the game, which is actually a good idea. You have to show your skills in different racing leagues all over the world to get their appreciation and win them for the WRC (World Series Racing), a league where the best drivers of the world meet each other on the racetrack. The idea is great, but the implementation didn't succeed... It's always the same: Win in leagues, unlock new leagues, win against those leagues, win the WRC, win in new leagues, unlock, WRC...If you want to play a realistic racing game with great game modes and a cockpit view, buy GRID 1 instead of GRID 2.If you already played GRID 1 and think about buying GRID 2, because you liked the gameplay, do NOT do that. You will only be very disappointed. It has nothing to do with the previous version of GRID.			"

Stick this out long enough past the first season, there's new race modes that unlock that keep it feeling fresh. On sale this is a must buy for arcade race fans.			"

												Good and varied roster of cars. actually impressed to see cars like the BAC Mono in here. cars are pretty and detailed. graphics are very nice, but trees look very bad during the night/with fog. physics aren't that bad. however, cars drift too much (even if they are ""grip"") and the crash engine is very unforgiving, especially when crashing against AI (they don't seem to be affected if you crash against them. however, you will start making spins which is really, really frustrating). multiplayer is dead, which is a shame. not one of the best racing games i have played, but still pretty fun (if you can stand the problems it has)			"

												This game is very limited compared to the original GRID in terms of what you can do, only specific tracks can be used for certain disciplines and the original ""freeroam"" drifting is gone. No more sliding sideways endlessly for a 99x combo which is what I played the original game for, a little dissapointed to be honest/ Stick to the original GRID for more fun.			"

												I like racing games.  I lean more towards the arcade racers as simulators don't do much for me.  I'm not a car guy and most of the things that sims go into mean absolutely nothing to me. Grid 2 is a weird one as it isn't really a simulator at all, yet it doesn't quite fit into the super-fast and drifty style of your common arcade racer. Burnout and Forza Horizon are the kind of arcade racers that are usually right up my alley.  Grid 2 just isn't quite there.  All of the tracks consist of tight turns through city streets and country sides and the drift controls just aren't tight enough to make this game stand out from the pack.  Too many times I've found myself leading a race for three laps only to blow in one hair pin turn that I *should* have drifted through.  Although, it's possible I just suck! Yet... I still find myself recommending Grid 2.  Despite my dislike of it, it's not horrible.  I still find myself drawn back to it time after time.  When the controls are working, the races are fun.  Just not quite Burnout/Forza Horizon fun.  The stickers are paint job options are fun, yet there's no real incentive as you just have them, you don't have to unlock them.  In fact, there's really not a whole lot of incentive to unlock stuff.  The more I type, the more it's kind of a tough sell. This racer's not great.  It's not the worst racer you'll ever play.  It's somewhere in the middle.  The important bit is, if you watch the sales, you'll find it cheap and it makes good filler in between the next big thing in urban racing excitement. "

												To the senses, this game is amazing. Beautiful graphics and with accurate and detailed sounds easily draw you in. After that, however, things can become a bit muddy. Is it a sim? Is it an arcade racer? It's difficult to tell exactly what this game was intended to be. And while it may seem a bit pedantic to complain, there's a point to be made. When going through the first few minutes of any game, it is essential to get a good feel for how things handle. Physics and controls are VERY important, and once you get a handle on what to expect, the better you become. That goes doubly so for racers. In a simulation game, physics and car characteristics vary from vehicle to vehicle, but all within reason; opponents follow the rules of their car. Conversely, arcade racers are allowed some wiggle room with drift or grip handling and wacky doodle physics to make the ride fun; opponents follow their own rules of performance. This game just kind of screws you around with everything. Car handling is weird and unpredictable, and the moment you get a hang of how goofy your car is, they make you switch to something else that is equally ridiculous and goofy. The ""marked"" opponents that you're supposed to ""watch out for"" have god-like attributes to their vehicles in most cases, as they always shoot to the front and away from the pack. So while you're busy flopping around trying to deal with your car on a new track you cannot practice on (another huge gripe), the marked opponent, in the very same car you have, is inexplicably way ahead of you.I don't exactly hate it, I'm still trying to get the hang of it, but everything is just so imbalanced that when I try to treat it like one type of racer, I'm immediately punished for it. Where's the fun in that?			"

												I have recently bought GRID autosport, which probably means that i am not going to be playing GRID 2 very regularly as i have migrated to playing autosport, so i decided that i would write a review, seeing as i was rather close to 100 hours so i think i know what im talking about, or atleast mostly.GRID 2 is an amazing game, probably the best racing game that i am yet to play, other than the new release of GRID which is infact GRID autosport. There are so many features and aspects that i like about GRID 2, but im not going to list them all as i would be going on forever, so im going to keep them blunt, short but informative at the same time.Things i liked about the game:--------------------------------The controls: The controls took me a matter of minutes to get use to, and from there i was able to drive nice and smoothly, without having to worry about pressing the wrong button on my remote. (I believe you can also use a steering wheel for this game).The detail/graphics: The maps, the cars, the road, even the cones. you name it. Everything looks brilliant. The reflections on the cars are brilliant, and this detail is consistent throughout the whole game, and the graphics that they have produced, can even run on my computer which i am suprised about. The game is not slow or laggy whatsoever, meaning that you can have a very smooth racing experience, but at the same time have a lovely eyesite of distant mountains, as you control your car.Music: The game has a variety of different tracks that are played throughout the game. The loading music, the main menu music, the racing music, all of it is of a high standard, and is great to listen to, and really makes you feel like your driving a car.AI: The AI of this game are great. The WSR campaign, which is pretty much a singleplayer mode, is absolutely realistic, due to the fact that the computer drivers have been programmed so good. When driving, the way that the drivers move and think are so lifelike, and occasionally challenge you if you do in-fact smash into the back of there car, but i wouldn't try it.Handling: All of the cars are tuned to perfection, and getting use to each type of handling, which each of the cars uniquely have is done with ease. Multiplayer: Although the multiplayer is on the verge of becoming dead, its still great fun when playing with a full lobby, and the feeling of taking another persons car out after them doing it before hand is beautiful. (Not that thats how you should drive.)Bad points about the game:-----------------------------What are you talking about? There are no bad points about this game! Despite all the people that have played GRID 2 and complained about it, i think that they should simply realise that codemasters took their time making this, as it is truly a masterpiece, and an experience that i am never going to forget. The game is absolutely brillaint, and upon buying GRID autosport which was released shortly after im reviewing this, i cannot wait to carry on with the next game in the series. Thank you so much codemasters for bringing us this game, and i would like to thank you for also releasing Autosport, as so far it is brilliant. Thank you, and i hope that this review has influenced anyone that is planning on buying the game.			"

												Look, I'm not all that coordinated anymore. I get that. It happens with old age. We fall down. We drop things. We lose our dentures. I want to die sleeping peacefully, not like the other screaming passengers in my car. But if I'm awake, there's one thing I can still do well and that's drive. If real cars had physics like this, no one would be able to stay on the road and I've raced vehicles before. These ice skates with axles handle horribly. They don't turn or brake worth a darn. Tapping on the brakes will send the car suddenly careening off 90 degrees in some random direction. It would be easier to drive a pinball than these tings. I've tried this game from hard to very easy and the handling isn't much different. Cars just can't stay on the road. Bumping another car - even if you hit their back quarter panel on a turn - will send your car careening off wildly while their car isn't impacted at all. I guess Newton's Second Law does not exist in the GRID2 universe.The most important things about any racing game are the driving and physics. GRID2 seems to have forgotten both. Perhaps it is different with a wheel, but with a gamepad I find it unplayable. It smacks of a poor console port and you can do better for your money. This game isn't worth your time or your dollars.			"

												Yeah, this game is fun, I guess. Some of the mechanics are ridiculous, though.  If an NPC spins you out or even nudges your bumper mid-race, you are guaranteed to end up facing the opposite way you need to be, though, regardless of how well you try to steer out of it, and might as well just restart as there is no possible way to recover.  So just be forewarned - save yourself a lot of frustration and know that unless you race perfectly, be prepared to ""restart"" a lot of races.  Some races are factually unwinnable, especially the ones at the racetracks.  The best, though, are the races where you're all in the exact same car, but the NPCs can corner at 120mph and you spin out at 60.The game is fun, to be sure, once you know what you're doing, but just be prepared for a lot of WTF head shaking at the blatant cheating.  I am going to say that I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for two dollars or less.			"

												Grid 2 likes to use the tagline ""The Thrill of Driving"" to describe the game in a single marketing slogan.  I think that's a pretty apt phrase because this is a driving game that really, fully, single-mindedly commits to the ""thrill"" of driving as compared to other driving games both from Codemasters and other development houses out there which throw their focus more on the lavish depth of accuracy in the presentation of the cars, or the devoted attention to the sport of motor racing with a high emphasis on realism in performance.  No, Grid 2 is a game so devoted to that ""Thrill of Driving"" aspect that I think it's carved out a whole niche to itself: Driving Pornography.In Grid 2 you are encouraged to drive full tilt without consideration for gas, tire wear, or weather conditions.  You need not concern yourself about the damage you incur by driving clumsy, and there are no penalties for being unsportsmanlike.  All Grid 2 wants from you is to drive fast, fast, fast, and to feel awesome and look cool while you're doing it.  Here's some thoughts about what makes this game unique in presentation: you will be given cars that have minimal explanation of the differences between them and yet enjoyable handling subtleties are there which render some choices powerful while others are over-the-top suicidal until you've had 60+ hours of practice with them.  The single player campaign throws the beginner driver (without practice first) into the midst of tracks that can and will destroy your vehicle if you lose traction, then makes sure that the sun is shining in your face as you round hairpin turns.  You will be given control of cars that can do 220 mph in straight runs and then be asked to make near constant right angle turns through the narrow streets of Chicago.  Cost is literally no object here as your garage grows regularly in size because of the ephemeral power of ""fans"" which is a weak and poorly executed stand-in for ""money"" in the single player game.  You will drive your multi-million dollar supercars as though they were replaceable toys and slam them, drift them, and wear them out with gleeful abandon and then see them magically repaired at no cost or penalty for the next race.  For better or worse you'll never spend too much time on any given race as they typically last between two and six minutes in length and even the custom and online races limit you to no more than 10 laps at a time.  Grid 2 is also *EXTREMELY* drift-happy and loves nothing better than to see 12 cars sliding their way through an apex and bumping and slapping each other and the walls all the way.Driving pornography: Grid 2 is definitely not to be confused with a full depth driving simulation experience, -it is absolutely an arcade game and as such it is very, very approachable and very, very fun.As a followup to Grid 1, the sequel is pretty much more of the same with an even greater emphasis on the ""pretty"".  While the cars aren't as lushly rendered as Forza the presentation is slick and polished and there's a nice sense of differentiation between both the different tier levels of cars on offer and the various types within each tier.  The tracks come in many varieties from narrow street point-to-point journeys to real-world circuit tracks that offer more true sport-like experiences.  Unlike some other Codemasters racing games you won't be constantly bugged and mugged by the different personalities of the competition drivers although you'll still be able to pick out which of the AI drivers has been tweaked to always be at the head of the pack no matter what.  Unlike Grid 1 this sequel feels compelled to offer some sort of story explanation for why you're racing in so many different styles of cars and racing disciplines and I found the presentation to be ridiculous and unnecessary, particularly when my beginner racing performance (consisting of bulldozing my way through the lead cars in order to get ahead) was hailed as ""champion"" material by the ESPN hosts complete with inane online message forum ""fans"" frothing at the bit because of my awesomeness.Multiplayer has the potential to be really entertaining but at this point in the game's release it's pretty hit-and-miss.  For starters I found the my default U.S. server literally empty for days at a time until I read on a forum that you should change your regional setting to Europe (I chose London) where there's more people frequently playing (still sparse though with less than 7 race sessions at any given time).  Once I succesfully joined a match it was good to see that the tiered performance structure means that it's difficult for veteran players to have cars which are inherently better than what a newcomer would be able to compete against.  The bad news is that it doesn't matter because veterans will have memorized all the track layouts and know where to brake and accelerate and squeeze every millisecond of performance from the car choices making it tough to stay competitive until you've personally put in the aforementioned 60+ hours.  There's also a tendency for online matches to go with the ""full damage"" mode where collisions will regularly destroy your vehicle or at least cause you to hobble about the course on bare rims and minimal steering control.  Worse is the frequent situation where a slight mistake in the lead car of the pack will cause a massive unavoidable pile-up collision with the rest of the following.  Such a thing renders all your skill and track knowledge useless... it takes such a tiny error to screw things up for the rest and sometimes you'll find yourself with a twit who purposely takes the chance to screw with you.One special note is that demolition derby, the fun and guilty-pleasure free-download available, has a MAJOR bug in it where you will frequently discover your progress is set back an entire lap for no explainable reason at all which makes it damn near impossible to recover from.  It's bad enough that demolition derby encourages people to fu** with you by willfully inflicting fishtail spinouts but this bug stacks the deck against you from the start with a frequency approaching 8 out of every 10 races having this bomb blow up in your face.  I also have a serious issue with how the corner-cutting mechanic is executed.  The developers have stated in the first game they had to build indestructable barriers around the tracks in order to keep people from cutting corners and that had gameplay ramifications they wanted to avoid, so in Grid 2 the tracks are free(er) from such obstructions but if you do cut through a corner improperly you'll find your momentum immediately halted and you can't resume acceleration for a period of time ""equal to the time advantage gained by corner cutting"".  That's fine... in theory.  In practice it becomes very frustrating because it's possible to avoid the penalty hit if you're careful how you exit your shortcut but then there are corners where there's a wall two feet from the apex of the turn and if you drift through that two foot gap you'll be slapped down for it even though the supposed ""shortcut cheat"" advantage is almost nil and the course essentially requires you to move through that gap to maintain your speed.  Is Grid 2 worth buying?  I think $30 for the base game is worthy.  $15 to $10 is an instant purchase.  The DLC car packs are so-so... it's hard to figure out the differences between the 80(?) cars on offer so you could easily skip all the extra cars and not miss them.  If the ""Reloaded"" edition is on sale for less than $30 though, yeah, get that.  The new tracks and routes are worth buying since they help keep the track choices from getting too repetitive.I had lots of fun with this, and yeah.... soft-core driving porn.  It's like that.			"

												Graphics are good.That's pretty much my only positive.Sadly, I have racing games that are more sim orientated as well as racing games that are more arcade orientated, so for me there was no need for GRID2.It doesn't have the nostalgia factor of old NFS titles (Most Wanted, Underground) although it does suffer (badly) from horrendous narrations telling me to drive faster, or drift...driftier. There are annoying cutscenes as well. Ugh.Far and away the most annoying thing was the incessant screen resolution errors - it kept resizing the game as a box in the middle of my screen - this has been a bane of a lot of games in my library: if it gives me customization issues, I'll close it and jump to the next most similar game.  There are very very few games nowadays that are worth the time to try and fix little issues and niggles.I'm not saying you won't enjoy it, but I found it not worth my time. I might come back to it and it'll work better. I might let it just hover in my library.I don't like it, I don't hate it. I probably won't talk about it again after I post this review - it's like reviewing the Lightly Salted crisp flavour.Update after a re-visitI recently revisited this game when going through my racing games in order to have a bit more of a comparison, and these are some points I noticed now (after sinking even more hours into other racing games as well):The cars seem to be locked behind a progress barrier. That means that you can't access them until you've unlocked them (or, if you can, I certainly couldn't find it). That formula worked for games like NFS Underground or Most Wanted, but gaming has changed since then.The cars and tracks have no realism to them. Which, I guess, is fine; but as I said - it's not really arcade-y enough to get away with that.I am seriously unimpressed with the ""drifty"" nature of the racing. Cars seemed far too likely to slide constantly; not an issue, but with a game like Ridge Racer it feels a lot more fun. Plus, I have Burnout in my library, so I see no need to play a game where the cars handle badly and it isn't fun.I played this on a Logitec G27 - this should explain a lot of my frustrations, since a game that supports a steering wheel and pedals shouldn't punish you for using it - lightest touch on the brakes locks you up and slides you around.Your pit crew yak away in your ear more often than a rally navigator. I have no idea why the dev thought this was a good idea.Ultimately - this game is okay, and this may have been a positive review if I hadn't already played games like NFS, Assetto Corsa, Ridge Racer, Burnout, Project CARS etc etc etc...it's kinda like your first relationship - feels perfect because you have nothing to compare it to.

												TL;DR - Vroom vroom crash sometimes but smiley face. 6/10PRO:1. Good arcade racing - I've spent many, many hours in this game, primarily in the multiplayer section. While it can be frustrating at times with the amount of accidents people seem to get into, I've also had a great number of tremendously fun and close races2. Seeminly endless supply of new blood - lots of people are at or near the MP level cap (level 99), but there are usually a good number of lower levels floating about. While that mixture of levels and experience does segregate the field a bit on track (which is kind of a con really), it also evens out the gradient a bit. Also gives great opportunity for lower levels to learn which cars suit which tracks and how to corner effectively (NOT THAT THEY SEEM TO NOTICE!)CON: 1. Very poor DLC integration - things like the Spa pack provide content that only very rarely can be used. Not many people choose to host the extra tracks in custom events, and even if they do there are often problems in joining sessions. If you don't EXACTLY match the number of DLC packs they have, you can't join their game.For single-player only guys, this isn't an issue as you can use the content at your whim, but it's been the multiplayer that kept this game going for me2. Poor car balance - there are clear favourite cars in each of the four tiers. You can beat them in ""lesser"" cars, but only if you absolutely nail every single braking point and apex of every single metre of track. Cars which are already powerful get a great number of upgrade slots, while poor cars only have space for a handful, which don't even make a difference. "

												An accurate simulation of what would happen if you handed a bunch of 11 year olds the keys to some high powered cars and told them to just flatten the accelerator into the first corner with all the forethought and finesse their pre-teen brains can muster. Do you like either going in a straight line or getting sweaty palms because there is a 1 degree bend in the road and the car behind you had the brake pedal listed as an optional extra that the owner was too much of a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to fork out for?

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Grid 2 

			Views: 2,108		

			We take a look at Codemasters flagship tarmac based racing game Grid 2. Please leave you feedback in the comments below and be sure to like and subscribe!		

Grid 2 is about the role of your driver in the formation and proliferation of World Series Racing, an international racing series that encompasses several racing disciplines across a wide range of car types. While this structure makes sense in the context of the narrative it has the unfortunate side effect of wearing out each location's welcome. Each region has three or four primary race location with varying routes through each. While the tracks themselves are technically different they share sections and landmarks from tracks that you previously raced in. Spreading a dozen races across three locations where you encounter some of the same sections across various routes does not leave the impression that variety is this game's strong suit despite a track list that would indicate otherwise. Grid 2's greatest innovation is it's LiveRoute system. Basically track designs are modular and with LiveRoutes these sections of track are loaded on the fly completely randomizing the track and forcing players to react to each change since the mini map is unavailable. Each section of track comes together seamlessly without creating any awkward or impossible turns though some sections of track can be repeated several time throughout an event which really detracts from the novelty of the feature.Vehicles embody the characteristics of their real world counterparts but sliding and drifting are much easier and emphasized but Grid 2 is devoid of the turbo boosts and jumps that characterize pure arcade racers. Ultimately it's a system that is extremely enjoyable. Muscle cars roar and and corner like hippos sprinting around a KY jelly covered skating rink. Tuners slide around like asthmatic mosquitoes as their turbos hiss and wheeze while track cars warp across the asphalt and slice through corners like razors through the wrists of a My Chemical Romance fan. Unfortunately the car count is on the small side, encompassing less than fifty of the most elite performance vehicles from the past and present. Well I should say the most elite races not to wear Porsche, Ferrari or Lamborghini badges. Customization is also limited to changing wheels and adding garish liveries to your machines. Copious sponsor stickers also spoil your vehicle's aesthetics while offering an opportunity to complete objectives that earn WSR more fans. Togue events, Checkpoint races, Overtake events, Endurance races, Drift events, elimination races, and head to head races round out the event types. These events do an admirable job of keeping the main campaign from becoming stale. Likewise strong AI ensures that you have to work a bit for victories. You opponents can be really aggressive and full damage means that trying to play bumper cars in the corners can end your race or severely hamper your car's performance. Ricocheting off of your opponents in the first turn and holding the lead isn't as viable a strategy in Grid as it is other racing games.Car models are appropriately detailed though they lack cockpit views. Matte, gloss, metallic and pearlescent paint are convincingly rendered and the damage models are unrivaled. Hoods, bumpers, fenders, spoilers and trunk lids can be smashed off and tires can even rupture. Geometry wrinkles and deforms after impacts in a rather convincing manner. As great as all of this is what really stands out are the tracks... Sparks from overhead subway rails shower the streets of Chicago and papers blow over the roadway, mists hover over the pavement in California as leaves blow around. Dubai's glorious skyscrapers and yachts dot the landscape. In short the tracks seem alive... It's a nice departure from the often drab and dead cityscapes that many games have you race through. The sound is also solid. Races are mostly scored with a symphony of pistons pumping like drums, turbos whistling like woodwinds and tires squealing like the string section. Exhausts howl, echoing off of mountain sides and tunnels and the echoing of your opponent’s vehicle seconds off of your lead can be intense.			"

												It's just so bad . First of all your car is made out of paper, but all other cars are made out of alluminium .  I doesn't matter which car you pick , hell if you even had a frickin monster truck it would according to this game also be made out of paper . But that's not the worst part oh no . The worst part is the fricking handling of the cars . The cars are so out of control you would had better luck doing it in real life . Other than that there's not much to complain . It's just so dissapointing , this could have been a great racing game but it just fails on the most simplest thing's .			"

												GRID 2 is one of the best driver games I ever have played, and the most fun driver game I know. Race against your friends, beat your pwn highscores, play many of the gamemodes and much more. There is always something to do in GRID 2.GRID 2 is a skill based driver game, which I liked very much. It is very great to see a driver game, where you needs to learn how to control the car. This gave me new challenges, which I enjoyed a lot.If you prefer to play Single Player, the game also has a Carrer Mode. I enjoyed the Carrer Mode from start to the end. You're starting as a driver, who not has many fans and not many sponsors. But every match you win, every season you win will more sponsers get interested in you and more fans will come. It's like being a real driver. The goal is being the best driver in the world, and winning all ""World Series Racing"" which is the seasons. GRID 2 will only give you a great experience, and it is recommended so much if you like driver games.  "

												There are several racing games out there. Some are realistic, simulating the hardcore aspects of driving, correct braking and approach to turns. Some are fantastic, with weapons and whatnot turning the racetrack into a hectic battlefield of missiles and banana peels.Some are inbetween, focusing on keeping the pedal to the metal and powersliding your way through the race and to the podium.GRID 2 is not like any of these games.GRID 2 is about second chances.GRID 2 is about besting yourself in every race.GRID 2 is about mastering every car and every driving style.GRID 2 is about incredibly awesome, high speed overtakes. GRID 2 is about doing turns at 200 km/h with both left tires empty.GRID 2 is about keeping your car straight when it has no front wheels.GRID 2 is about having fun.			"

												I bought Grid 2 because of the amazing game called Grid 1. Grid 2 brings good graphics and details with a lot of sound especially when you're going around the race track. However this game is not as good as Grid 1 as you get the cars during the game, so it's pretty much straight forward for when you're playing on single player. It would of been great to have the visual of what part of your vehicle is broken instead of some audio saying ""Your left wheel is damaged, expect some pull when you turn.""The game would have been good if it carried on with the cars mileages and the price of them as this made you think more on saving on your budget.I’ve tried multiplayer once and didn’t really enjoy it as it’s just the same concept as single player but you just play with other people and gain levels. I can’t really say much about it as I’ve only played one game and didn’t enjoy it much.The game is good overall but it could have been much better if they didn’t change it all!  "

												It's a fun arcade racing game.Pros: Fast passed game.         Custom paint job for each car.         Various challenges.         You can progress the game even if you don't like a challenge.         Various cars.         Correct feeling after your car is damaged. (make sure you have this option on)Cons: If you hit another car (or another car hits you) you will slide and most of the times and get off-track. Even if it's not your fault          Expensive DLCs           Too much drift.          Seems like the AI cars follow a specific route in circuits no matter what.          No camera from inside the car!			"

												Grid 2 is a really good Arcade style racing game, thoroughly recommended (especially over most of the recent Need for Speed games). Varied racing modes, decent variety of cars and mechanically it plays well. The Single Player campaign is enjoyable and lasts around 20 hours. Multiplayer is ok, it adds more longevity to the game with a Call Of Duty style progression system. However, race events are a bit of a destruction derby where the podium positions are usually determined by whoever manages to get through the first few corners without being ran off the road by another vehicle.  I can't comment on racing wheel support or how the game plays for wheel users, I just played it using an Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed my time with it.			"

												I was having a blast with this game until I got to Season 5. When you get to Season 5, the game kicks in the worst rubber banding I have ever seen in a racing game since the old racing games you would play on Genesis or SNES. We are talking being in an Elimination race with a 5 - 10 second lead over the entire field and in the last minute an AI car will not only catch you, but will maintain a 2+ second lead on you. I understand the game isn't a simulator, but this is crap. I am glad I didn't pay full price for it and I won't be buying GRID Autosport. I enjoy the F1 series that Codemasters develops, but I will look for something else to try and fill the GT racing void.			"

												This game is great for a while with a pretty good singleplayer story and fun driving physics, but it certainly has some (at times) game-breaking/ruining flaws. Although some flaws might draw you away from this game, I would probably still suggest it. HOWEVER: The Reloaded Edition is a true waste of money; half the cars just performance versions of the previous ones, and in multiplayer, (if you can find a game) DLC is almost always disabled. Also, IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!PROS:- Physics (while at times completely unrealistic) make this game for me. They're probably the most fun/realistic of many racing games I've played- Singleplayer mode is quite extensive and fun, and it lets you use most cars in the game pretty regularly- Customization might not be the best, and it has a serious flaw (as shown in cons), but it is very expansive for personalizing a car to your liking- This game adapts to your driving style very well, for example: If you prefer drifting, you know you can overtake/attack opponents at corners very effectively, while using a more powerful car with more traction lets you overtake others on straightsCONS:- Customization has a very annoying flaw: You cannot use the default liveries of your cars unless you're in multiplayer; in singleplayer the default livery is automatically applied to all vehicles without any confirmation from the player ... This actually ruins customization for me, especially being an owner of the Reloaded Edition and not being able to use the DLC liveries (but meh, the Reloaded Edition was under $30 on♥♥♥♥♥- The AI in this game is the worst I've seen in any game for years; AI using drift cars act exactly as others using grip cars; each AI has no personality of its own ... In addition, the AI units don't have any apparent awareness of your positon; they commit to their actions regardless of where you are, commonly resulting in them pitting you, ramming you into the side of the wall, or braking before necessary, causing you to crash into them (it is quite obvious that this is not meant to be a feature excused by ""aggressive drivers"")- The multiplayer is indeed the worst I've seen of any game; not only are there very rarely players on, and if you manage to find some, DLC is always disabled, and overall its design is terrible: flashbacks (if enabled) have clearly had 5 minutes spent in their design, the AI is even worse (driving absurdly slowly, having even less awareness of you, etc.), players are able to ram you out of the way without any effect to their progress, etc ... AGAIN: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER GAME!Despite all these flaws, I would still suggest this game for its pros; it is still a fun game and decent racing game.			"

												The differences between Grid1 and Grid2 are totally awesome! The first one, it is about the graphics, Grid2 has an excellent graphic quality even on slow hardwares. About the multiplayer, Grid2 can offer to its users a great experience almost perfect. And better, Grid2 is possible find a good one with a cheap price.			"

												GRID 2 is one of the best driver games I ever have played, and the most fun driver game I know. Race against your friends, beat your pwn highscores, play many of the gamemodes and much more. There is always something to do in GRID 2.GRID 2 is a skill based driver game, which I liked very much. It is very great to see a driver game, where you needs to learn how to control the car. This gave me new challenges, which I enjoyed a lot.If you prefer to play Single Player, the game also has a Carrer Mode. I enjoyed the Carrer Mode from start to the end. You're starting as a driver, who not has many fans and not many sponsors. But every match you win, every season you win will more sponsers get interested in you and more fans will come. It's like being a real driver. The goal is being the best driver in the world, and winning all ""World Series Racing"" which is the seasons. GRID 2 will only give you a great experience, and it is recommended so much if you like driver games.  "

												The good: -Graphics-Damage models-smooth gameplay/no lagg spikes -Hillclimb maps-lots of cars and customization options -driving physics (this is very personal though) -flashbacks -lots of gamemodes The bad: -corner cutting penalties; pretty random imo -This game uses DLC's. I hate DLC's -No cockpit view-Multiplayer: barely players, no chatbox, takes ages to level up. If you do find a lobby, chances are big ppl try to crash into you. -AI cars: they suck, they take the corners extremely slow and ride extremely fast on the straights. Passing them without hitting them is like taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥without♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -No practice or free mode where you can drive around solo in a map for testing cars or doing time trials. You always need to ride with the♥♥♥♥♥♥AI cars, even in time trials. It's this that bothers me most.-Lack of ""real"" circuits like Spa (DLC : /), Monaco, Silverstone, Abu Dhabi etc. Although the street circuits look nice and are fun to play, they all look the same. -career mode: pretty boring imo. This is way to easy. You pass/crash into all the AI cars in the first round and then you ride solo until you finish. Overall the game is fun but only if you can play it with at least one friend. It's pretty nice when you're in an online lobby with more than let's say 6 ppl, especially if it's a clean and fair race, but unfortunately this is rarely the case. This game is clearly an arcade game. If you want a realistic racing game, don't get it but buy something like F12012. 7/10 for meRemember to put your seatbelts on and drive safely! "

												I just picture some central casting area with a bunch of guys in wraparound Oakleys, soul patches and/or half goatees, a 3/4 backwards Monster Energy baseball cap and a jersey of some kind, all desperately pleading with a single video game producer for them to be the next voice of the newest random extreme sports game like jet-skating or wind-flying or kite-masturbating. Yeah, it's one of those games, where someone who just snorted a bunch of coke in an ADR booth off an intern is telling you  how many social media followers you've just earned by power-sliding over 100 feet. If you're in 8th place prepare to be♥♥♥♥♥♥shamed by an LA producer's idea of what should motivate the target divorced father of six with dreams of running Daytona and a $20,000 gaming rig demographic.This game creates a ridiculous and jarringly inconsistant world of high stakes street-racing that seems to be sponsored by Microsoft, as they have the money to shut down the city of Chicago so you can place dead last in a junky old ford. It's ""edgy"" as defined by a room full of white forty-year old men.Anyway, everything is shiny and the things smash up real good so you should buy it on sale for $.99 Just turn off the announcers.

												In short: Great racing game.Longer version: You're being discovered as a talent in motor sports by Patrik Calahan and he tells you about this idea he's been having: WSR - World Series of Racing. In order to make this idea come true he would need a guy who could persuade different driving clubs over the world to participate in the series. So...The first season you're driving in the US, the second one in Europe, the third one in Asia... and the fourth one is the best drivers combined. What ""grinds my gears"" is that the fifth season makes the game SOMEWHAT outstaying its welcome, it doesn't need the fifth season since it's pracically the fourth one but with some faster cars.Also... Codemasters decided to remove the cockpit view. WHY?!?! It's the best one.But I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun (arcadey) racing game.			"

												I had the original Grid on xbox along with Forza 3 and while Forza puts you to sleep playing it Grid kept you wide awake. To this day Grid is the only racing game i've played where you actually get a real sense of speed when racing.Grid 2 isn't as good as the first, they took a few things out like being able to spectate when waiting to race when a session has already started (you can now only spectate if you had already been playing and crashed/retired) . I also don't like the interface either.Car handling is similar to the first Grid but maybe slightly easier? i still get the same sense of speed playing this that i did playing the first one, so in that sense it's just as addictive for me playing it.Graphics with everything turned up to max only really seem marginally improved over the original (but then the first one looked great to begin with), I guess the smoke effects have improved and the exhaust heat.I should warn people actually that if you buy it now you really need to buy the car DLC as well to stand a chance in a race as you have to level up to buy certain tiers of cars. If you don't have certain cars unlocked you will only be able to realistically come 6th place in a race, you won't be able to win or come in the top 3 that's for sure. Also what's ridiculous is you can only unlock tier 4 cars (highest tier supercars) when you are in the mid 20 ranks. I am rank 31 right now and put in about 70 hours of play time, so you are looking at playing for 50ish hours to unlock the last tier of cars without DLC. The game does loan you a car if you don't have one for the required tier but the one they loan you for tier 4 is terrible, can't steer or turn to save its life. The cars they loan you for tier 2 and 3 are fine, tier 1 not so much.If you played and liked the first game you will probably like this, if you haven't played the first one i'd wait till it's on sale to try it out as it's a polarizing ARCADE game (not a sim) as you might not like the fairly simplistic car handling.But saying all that, the sheer sense of speed you get while playing it you can't get anywhere else, and that's what does it for me which is why i'm addicted to this racer.7.5/10			"

												Probably the greatest racing sim I've ever played. No, it's not as realistic or in-depth as Forza, and lack the tuning options of many other successful racers, but it strikes a delicate balance between Need For Speed arcade-ey-ness, and Forza's realism.  You'll be challenged by the delicate drifting mechanics and creative track designs, but the simple control scheme means you'll never need to worry about your controller getting in the way of your driving. Every race feels tense and exciting, every tracks prsents unique hazards and challenges, and provides new way to excel. You can attack courses an race series with a variety of tactics, from agressive and physical, to straight speed, to graceful drifting, and that combination of approaches is the secret to Grid's formula- you really don't have the chance to get bored with one mode before you're off playing a different format. The learning curve is rough, but you don't have to get first in every race to beat the game. My advice is to really take your time on the tack day after the intro race, really get a hang of high speed driving and drifting before you head out to the actual races. This game will suck up your time and test your abilities and reflexes, but it's worth every last drop of petrol. 9/10.			"

												GRID 2 ReviewI have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out.Single Player CampaignGRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into ""seasons,"" with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.Online MultiplayerThe GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.Replay FactorOne of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.Controls and GraphicsGRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.ValueI purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this ""North Pole Noir"" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.Aspect	RatingPhysics	10Plot	10Damage	9Multiplayer	10Community	10Graphics	10+Value	8Overall	9.5Final Points on the GameNot only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games.

												Great handling and graphics. If you like braking short and hard and drifting into corners hardcore, this is for you. Best played with a gamepad.You can take risks and if you screw up you can use a ""time-rollback"", of which you have a few every race, interesting idea, much better than the time slowdown that the old Most Wanted game had.

												Terrible game, AI cheats, car design is a mis-mash, zero attempt to adhere to the realism of many of the cars.  AI ignores players and plows into players ad-nauseum.  Cars are randomly fat, slow, or drift happy (drift is so unreal it's moronic).  Drift design ignores the laws of physics.  Drift, tire squeeeeeeeellll.Lens flare is often blinding, camera shakes absurdly over 120 MPH (why do all the bad racing games have this effect?), most of the races in the campaign are done without a sighting lap, so you'll be at a perpetual disadvantage.  The random levels are stupid, most of the locations are the same one backwards and forwards with such little variety.  It's like playing a late 90s racer with new graphics.0/10 at worst, 5/10 at the best moments.  DO NOT BUY.			"

												Grid 2 I think its a really fun racing arcade game. Codemasters is fast becoming one of my fav and go to for racing games. Dont understand all of the hate for codemasters and Grid 2. Sure Grid 2 has some issues and things wrong. The bottom line is that Grid 2 is fun and entertaining. The smoke effects are some of the best I have seen. The cars are cool and the track, although some times repetitive are fun to drive. LOVE U CODEMASTERS!!!!			"

Graphics:The graphics looks really nice and I'm on a older GPU, GTX260 and it still looks really good even if it's now maxed, with sparks flying when someone rolls their car or crashes into a wall.Sound/Soundtrack:The sound are good i must say, especially the crash noise, which if you drive like me hear pretty often. You can hear what other cars are doing around you even if you don't see them. The sound track tho, the first thing i did was to go in the menu and turn it off, haven't turned it on since i started it the first time.Handling:The handling isn't great, the car tends to drift way to much and when drifting have super tires that can grip anything, but if you see it from an arcade point of view it's not to bad, there is worse but there are worse. I do find the handling of the destruction derby cars to be better then the other cars, they actually feel heavy.Multiplayer:Here is where GRID 2 shines, many different game modes, from racing, drifting to destruction derby. And it's easy to create a lobby and start a game and you can create a mini league with up to 5 races which is super nice.Cockpit view:This is a hot one, when i first heard it i disregarded the game totally, but when i got i and started driving, it isn't something i really miss, sure i use it when playing Assetto Corsa and GTR2, but they are a completely different genre. The hood view is in my opinion just as good or even better in this type of game.DLC:I don't have any numbers here, but it feels like half the cars are DLC packs, which is totally rubbish, there are 11 pay DLC packs on steam 11!! That's like 10 to much. If i buy a game i want all the content. Soon Codemaster will starting to slice up the F1 games, knock on wood...Tracks/Cars:As said above there aren't many cars unfortunately, you've got your standard European BMW, American Muscle, some JDM, but it's not much. And for tracks i was disappointed, i usually like proper race tracks, but there are so few (without DLC) that the only tracks i tend to race are the A to B tracks.Overall:If you look at it for what it is and not for what it's predecessor was, it's a very fun game to play with your mates, get a lobby full of 12 people and just race. If you don't mind the drift handling it has and the lack of cars and tracks and like me find it for a fiver, it's definitely worth it.And for you hardcore GRID1 fans wait to see what Grid Autosport may have to offer.

												The graphics are really nice for this game, the car control feels the same as grid 1 with some minor improvements. The story section (world series) I've only done a few races but so far seems decent. The multiplayer has alot of fun when you get into a full room. Not sure on how many modes there are to do, there seems to be a few but only raced so far. The amount if cars is decent and could do with more. The audio of the game are good, from the engines to tyre screeching around roads. The little features are cool like a car infront if you wipes out goes through grass and sand and covers the road in smoke nice. There are a few things that I like but otherwise it is an improvement of grid 1. All I can say really. I hope for more cars but I know they will be paid DLC. If you enjoy grid 1 then you will enjoy this. Worth the cheap price for this game £26 and that's a bloody good price specially on this game. Grid is a superb game and so is grid 2.			"

												Though it is somewhat enjoyable, I cannot recommend this game. After six hours of playing, I can say that every new race just adds frustration and disappointment.  The AI is a nightmare Sunday afternoon. Whenever a corner comes along, they all slam on their brakes in syncronization and take it at a driving-school safe speed. When not on a corner, they form a massive rolling roadblock between you and the ""chosen one;"" the AI who started in first. Except in very rare cases, the AI do not trade positions.  If you are tired of the AI, you can try a gate-to-gate race, where every time you pass a truck you get points, every truck you pass increases the points given by the next truck, and losing paint resets the combo. However, you will soon find that the truck drivers are the same AI drivers, except after having been out partying and drinking all night. They have no ability to maintain their lane and seem determined to slam into you as you try to pass.  There are three types of cars. Drift, Grip, and Balanced. To me, drift seems to be like trying to drive a greased whale on ice, grip is the absolute reverse (whatever that may be. A rough shark in sand?), and balanced is so far in the middle that it is incapable of either drifting or gripping. Probably with more practice I could make any of the cars perform, but I simply don't care to.  In summary, I would suggest downloading the demo and just playing that. It's free and has most of the experience of the full game.			"

												Lots of fun, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The singleplayer is shorter than a Codemasters game usually is, but it isn't extremely short. The multiplayer is epic - especially with friends. People who crash into you can get annoying - since you usually end up losing, but once you learn to avoid them, it's a lot of fun. The biggest issue overall are the drift races - they're not well done, but considering all the positives of the game, this is a minor issue. Overall I was impressed.			"

												There are many better racing games on the market and very few more pointless.This takes what was good about the first Grid and turns it down a notch, so they could spend more time designing a menu screen that would look at home on a Need for Speed game. Originality is not a selling point of this title, nor is the racing. Graphically it's alright, nothing that will save it from a sale purchase at best. That is of course once you manually change the replay file to read-only so you don't suffer stuttering throughout the race, once again the customers solve the lazy devs work. Is it good? No, is it worth buying? If you own GRID, Need for Speed, Dirt... No...CTRL-C, CTRL-V racing at it's worst.			"

One of my personal favourites when it comes to racing games.Pros+ Good choice of cars, even without DLC+ Every car feels different+ Challenging gameplay+ Lengthy campaign+ Easy to use livery editor+ Graphics are amazing - Enviroments, Car Damage etc+ Fairly good choice of different modes+ Flashback modeCons- AI acts as if you're not there, they'll crash into you a lot- Can be grindy at times (Personally I like the grind but others may find it boring/repetitive)- Some of the cars are quite awkward to drive, the back ends will spin out too muchIf you enjoy racing games, then you'll probably enjoy GRID 2. If you're not very experienced with the genre then you may find GRID 2 a little too hard at the start.If you're going to pick this game up then I reccomend using a controller as it makes the game much more enjoyable!Hope this review has helped you decide whether or not to pick up the game!

												When I was looking at some information on this game, I found a quote from Codemasters in relation to the length of time it would take to complete Grid 2. This game is supposed to take more than 30 hours to complete.“We’ve noticed a trend in recent years with some of the supposedly ‘big’ games that were actually six hours long, and we didn’t feel that was sufficient value for money for our fans at all. We wanted to make sure there was so much more for them to do.”Normally I would complete a game prior to reviewing it, but in this instance I could not bring myself to do it. I will start with the cons first as this will give me some time to think of something good that this game has to offer.Cons:	Realism in this game has gone out the window. Codemasters pride themselves in the amount of effort they spend on realism in their F1 series. Unfortunately this is the only series that has remained true to its original. The original grid game was a lot of fun and on both the Xbox and PC version I have spent untold hours playing (mainly drifting) and hat a lot of fun. This game just doesn’t have the same appeal. Even The Colin McRae series died along with Colin Dirt 1 was the last of the series that was any good. Dirt 2 was supposed to be a homage to Colin McRae, but it was appalling.	Drifting: DRIFTS ARE NOT POPPING THE HANDBRAKE AND DOING A LITTLE SLIDE ROUND THE CORNER. Grid was so much fun when it came to the drift challenges. There was nothing more satisfying than pulling off a linked chain of drifts for an entire lap and then watching the replay for that satisfaction. All you do in this game is pull the handbrake (or E-Brake) coming in to a corner, do a little slide, drive up to the next corner and repeat. You cannot keep drifts going in this game. For those of you that are looking at buying this game to relive those font memories of drifting around an entire track but with revised graphics, don’t bother. Just like me, you will be sorely disappointed.	Your friendly AI team coordinator that is in your ear every race: Even if your mechanical knowledge is strictly limited to knowing where the fuel goes in to your car, you will find the commentators remarks cringe worthy. Unfortunately when he first introduced himself at the start of the game, something in the back of my mind was telling me that this game was not going to live up to its predecessor.	It’s not fun: There are 2 types of games, ones that you look at the time and think; “gees, is that the time, I should have eaten 5 hours ago” and those that make you look at the clock like you are at work and are waiting impatiently for 5:00 so you can go home and do something FUN. Grid 2 falls in to the latter category. 	No cockpit view… Not that it matters in an arcade racer… But it was a real game it would need an in car view.Pros Pro	It looks pretty.Codemasters should look at creating entire new games when they want to change from realism to arcade, instead of leeching off the popularity of their previous games and developing cruddy arcade racers. Basically, this game would be better if they didn’t call it Grid 2 and get everyone’s hopes up. "

												I'm no racing expert, but I've played a lot of racing games since my first Intellivision in the early 80's.  Grid 2 is very good.   Just like another CodeMasters gem, Dirt 3, this has beautiful graphics that still look beautiful when running Grid 2 on a laptop with an Intel HD 4000 GPU.  This also integrates perfectly with the Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers for PC.When I'm on the Xbox, it's Forza, but on PC, it's Grid 2.			"

												One of my favourite Racing games. Some features are missing from the predecessor but that´s not bad. The driving is very arcade-oriented. The singleplayer is really good and motivational. The multiplayer is good too and there are still people who playing it.Conclusion: An awesome Racing game. Highly recommended.			"

												Didn't grab me as much as the first incarnation but still a damn fine racing game. Codemasters need to lose the race guy progression story and concentrate on actual content. I love the look and feel of these games and as racing games go they are my best. If you like a balanced racing game then go right ahead, just ignore the waffle and you'll be fine.Must play!			"

												Despite the fact that you're using Steam, you need to make a special account to play this online. Since I didn't want to, I played single player. It was okay, but I really couldn't enjoy it. They force you to use drift cars for the first few missions and as a long time Forza player, this made these races really REALLY annoying. The drift physics are really weird and you can't skip these missions. I even have other cars from DLC which I should be allowed to drive in the races, but they restrict the cars to ONLY the drift car you start with, then ONLY the drift car you win during that race. You get to pick between two prize cars, but they were both drift. Maybe I'm just oversensitive, but the refusal to let me not drift took all fun out of the game for me.			"

												Forget the creators' description of this being a hybrid of arcade and simulation. This game is 100% arcade. It's still a great racing game, though there is a learning curve to become a good and clean driver.Online is fun, but it's not without it's issues. Always be on noob alert, they'll take you out on the first corner. This game is region-locked, meaning you'll only be connected to the server according to your steam download region. It's mostly UK and US players that are still active. You'll need to change your d/l region if you want to reach more players.Overall, it's fun arcade racing game that's good for casual players.It's best played with a gamepad.			"

												Graphic, sound are good, damage physics is good.But the most important thing in racing games, Car physics (control) is really bad.It's no where near simulation. It's somewhere near arcade, but it's not. It's like... somewhere between them and it's awful.In this game, you go through corners faster with drifting than braking and following the racing lines. It's ok for arcade style, but then it tries to be like simulation, tiny error will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you lose places or even crash your car (that's why there is rewind feature?). This control will make you very frustrated when you go deeper in the career mode (when your cars are faster and facing harder components).May be you can do better after practicing more with this game. But when you played another racing games, no matter it's simulation type like F1 2013 or arcade type like NFS, you will find it hard to adapt to this controls. It's very unique that no racing game is similar to this.This game shows potential but it's totally ruined by its car physics.			"

												I'm greatly enjoying this game. Love the handling - reminds me of PGR.Runs really smooth with my HD 7870. I'd go as far as to claim that this is the best looking Racing Game available at this moment - since Need for Speed Rivals has been crippled to 30fps and Forza 5 has been downgraded to accomodate to the Xbox One's lacklustre performance ;PMy only gripe with GRID 2 so far is its businessmodel and pricing - there should have been no pre-order incentives to begin with - since there is no shortage of supply or shipping cost when it comes to digital distribution. I shouldn't be paying more just because I choose to buy the game during the week of its release rather than paying ahead of release... I simply like to be able to access the stuff I buy immediately once I put my money on the table. In addition I'm not a big fan of microtransactions only devalue the initial purchase and make people hold out for Sales and Collectors Editions... which I did. Aside from being rather pervasively integrated into this game - most of the car-pacs seem to be variations on the cars you can unlock in the game - thus don't seem to affect the balance of the game.The one DLC that does offer something interesting (Destruction Derby) comes at no additional cost.It appears that some Tier 3 cars which you should be able to win in career mode are locked away behind some nasty difficultiy spike - but thankfully you are able to switch difficultiy in the options at any time during your career which negates the frustration.I'm having a blast with this game so far - the WSR is a brilliant idea and provides a lot of diversity and motivation. There's a distinct Street Race Action-Movie feel to the game and its events which make it very cohesive - though its gritty Sepia tone and Hollywood Soundtrack may not be for everyone... but this is more down to personal preference and subjecitve perception. The Car demolition and aggressive AI work really well and add an additional layer to the challenge.I'm not missing the Cockpit View all that much, since I don't use it for racing - In other games I mostly use it  to check out the interiors - it kinda adds to the feel of driving a real car. Maybe with the arrival of Occulus Rift the Cockpit View will become relevant once again?All in all I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging Racing Game.9/10: Top of its Genre			"

												Good game, but multiplayer has some serious flaws.1: Noobs are at a disadvantage from the off, the vets have faster, tuned cars, so you have little chance to win.2: If you cut a corner, your car gets slowed down for 3 seconds. The system is flawed, other players can push you off track, you receive the penalty and you did nothing wrong. Oversteer or understeer on the cars can also cause you to go off track, you get penalty, your race is ruined. Others players use you car as their brake, pushing you off the track, you get the penalty3: Grid, the grid is flawed, if you get pole, you're in with a chance of winning, unless your car isnt as fast as the others then you're not in with a chance. if you're at the back or in the middle, it is highly likely you car will be smashed up into the first few corners by the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags who cant drive.Other than thosethings and a few others like the various dlc, then it's a good game. I didn't buy it, so those things aren't as annoying as they would be.			"

												Grid 2 is quite simply WAY better than the original Racer Driver: Grid game, not least because the cars are a lot more controllable and you're not doing about 200 donuts just because you breathed on the controller in this title. The game starts of easy enough and the various races aren't overly challenging, allowing you to win despite taking it relatively easy. However, get too used to this and once the global WSR event starts, you'll find you lack the ability and the confidence to control the more powerful cars at high speed, and believe you'll need to as the racing becomes MUCH more challenging at this point.The game is graphically amazing and features more cars than any other game i know. The racing is great and there's no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about with pointless storylines, it's just you, the car, the track, and your opponents... RACING. This is a racing gamer and petrol head wet dream!			"

												So a quick ""review"". PROs and CONs first. Then some comments & random notes I have about the game.(note, my #/10 score = MY ENJOYMENT + minimal thought of gameplay+graphics/sound+story etc.. )PROs:+fair amount of cars+fair amount of race types+fair amount of races+drifting felt for most part nice+""physics"" were fun (crashing and vehicle falling apart was nice toucn)CONs:-handling felt too quick and floaty (turning was way too sensitive)-too arcady-lack of vehicle customization-too ""sporty"" thematic (I'm not fond of them)-no cockpit view (can mod it in though)Comments:First I started playing I didn't like handling at all but got used it. Few hours into career I finally got to fun mountain passes and drifts.. that was the highlight of the game for me.It got variety (cars/races/race types).. but I don't like the whole ""sport"" thing in race at all. I mean the whole arranged tracks, ads EVERYWHERE. Side blockages and people... ""cheering"" just is.. not fun for me. I've been always fond of ""street race"" types. Got that satisfying ""danger"" feel.Nevertheless... drift handling was smooth and enjoyable, that I liked. But turning was so damn sensitive, I moved my stick a bit and damn car just instantly reacted and turned way too fast.Game got dull really fast for me...There is cockpit mod on the internet and some sort of overhaul mod. But I could not be bothered with this game anymore. Thus I'm done with it. As a game it's good. But for me personally it was borefest for most part.DROPPED5/10If you into car sports thematic and arcade racing you will probably like it much more than I did "

												Good game, but multiplayer has some serious flaws.1: Noobs are at a disadvantage from the off, the vets have faster, tuned cars, so you have little chance to win.2: If you cut a corner, your car gets slowed down for 3 seconds. The system is flawed, other players can push you off track, you receive the penalty and you did nothing wrong. Oversteer or understeer on the cars can also cause you to go off track, you get penalty, your race is ruined. Others players use you car as their brake, pushing you off the track, you get the penalty3: Grid, the grid is flawed, if you get pole, you're in with a chance of winning, unless your car isnt as fast as the others then you're not in with a chance. if you're at the back or in the middle, it is highly likely you car will be smashed up into the first few corners by the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags who cant drive.Other than thosethings and a few others like the various dlc, then it's a good game. I didn't buy it, so those things aren't as annoying as they would be.			"

												I'm really enjoying the game and haven't had as much fun in a racing game since the original Grid. If you are looking for a fun racing game with a variety of racing modes then this is the game for you. The graphics look good, the cars all handle differently and the game is a lot of fun.			"

												 GRID 2 is an arcade fun racing game, is not any realistic or serious car racing genre so if your mind are looking for some serious car racing I strongly suggest to look for other title to avoid disappointment. What can I tell from my experience by playing GRID 2? To this time 2017, GRID 2 still offer one of the most gorgeously stunning looking in game graphic  of environment,surrounding and vehicle as well. it look immersively amazing and polished. As for the gameplay and control for my taste; it feel like GRID 2 emphasize pretty heavy on drifting, so here and there almost every vehicle I drive just need some plus-minus and understanding of handling to catch the drift.GRID and GRID 2 has a totaly different handling and control for the vehicle. Either you get used to both of em or you going to dislikes one of it, so maketh your mind which would you consider to buy and play em! That's how I feel for both of the game. If you plan to bought GRID 2, please just ignore GRID by the time you get used to the handling and then you try to play GRID it would just mess up both of your game rhythm. From this, I understand WHY much GRID player complaint GRID 2 feel like driving on top of ice and GRID 2 control. Overall I had to sayeth; for a 75% discounted car racing game, GRID 2 is not a bad game. GRID 2 still able to offer car racing adrenaline rush and a good racing game at the end of day,not to forgot the amazingly stunning graphic. Although GRID 2 come with pretty limited customization but the paint job is seriously good and fun to play with. Save yourself a couple of buck and buy another car racing game if you plan to grab the full pack with DLC, You can just ignore all the DLC it don't make much a difference from usin factory preset car to run all the lap, you will drift and race just fine and have fun just the same or you could just choose which DLC content that have your prefer car instead of grabbing all of em.

												Beautiful, simplistic models, realistic lighting, tight controls, and awesome multiplayer mayhem.The story is also suprisingly strong. Progress that you make gives access to more events, giving a sense of accomplishment than most racing games.The car physics are also fantastic; I've never had my car tilt on it's side when I overshoot a drift. And then tumble thirty or so feet before somehow landing back on it's tires. Or cringing at how much car smashing carnage online races have within ten seconds into the first turn. Or edging off a cliffside/ wall at high speed and having the car really react to it.The only peeve I'd give it is how I'd have to manually change my resolution back to fullscreen from a windowed 800x600 when I go glance at my desktop.Otherwise, amazing game. I'd recommend it to any racing enthusiasts.			"

												I just finished GRID 2. I have to say that I'm a fan of it overall. They went for something different from what fans of GRID were expecting, and the drifty handling took a while to get a hold of. Yet, once I built some skill and realized what the devs were going for - a video-gamey crash and bash beautiful looking racer that takes some skill to master - I really got into it. I think, most people didn't give GRID 2 a chance. They flipped out when it wasn't exactly what they were expecting. Learning the handling is somewhat frustrating - I understand - but once I did, the game became super fun, and the racing was friggin' white knuckle right to the end. I really enjoyed my time with it, and I expect I'll return to it again sometime. There really isn't anything quite like it.			"

												GRID2 is the worst race game I've ever played, hard to believe its from the same developer as DiRT, although each iteration of dirt has got worst, wish I had stopped at dirt 2 but got and played dirt 3 as little as Grid 2. GRID 2 is just mindless street racing, with random lobbies in multyplayer your up against anyone from lvl 1 to lvl99, the only balancing to the game is that the lowest level player starts at the front, this only makes things worse as everyone else who is behind you has a faster car, one the race starts someone steers you into the wall then someone else smashes into your car spinning you round by the time you know which way your facing 2 -3 more cars smash you back into the wall, its like being inside a football rather than a car. Once everyone has passed and your moving again everyone else is out of sight, so you carry on in your crappy level 1 car possibly catching up to a few others but the leader is always gaining more ground & once they pass the finish line starts the 30 second count down, on avverage 50% of players then fail with a DNF as the race stops.    Defiantly not worth the 10 GB of hdd space it wastes.Racing games I have and highly recommend are, Screamer 2, Xpand Rally, DiRT, NSF Shift, WRC3			"

There is nothing out there i can compare this game to other than its predecessor. GRID2 has been improved in a lot of ways and all positive too. If you are seeking a Racing Game with all ranges of cars from classic to modern, high detailed graphics, and epic sound, then this is a must purchase. You won't be disappointed. The is a game you can have a quick race, or you can get right into the thick of managing your sponsors, car graphics and team. Multiplayer is good, but only prefer split screen with my kids, and its great fun too.Just awesome!			"

												I purchased this game when it first released because I am (was) a huge fan of the original GRID and of CodeMasters in general. This game is, without a doubt, a disgrace to the GRID franchise.You're forced to endure a stupid storyline that focuses on social media and getting popular. The handling is absolutely awful. It is about as far from a sim as you can possibly get. I should not be able to race entire tracks and full throttle and drifting should not be as easy as it is with EVERY car in this game.Pros:+ Good GraphicsCons:+ Terrible Social Media Gimmicky Junk+ Worst vehicle handling I've ever experienced+ Damage is unrealistic+ Starting in last place in every race means at one difficulty, the game will be easy, but at one step higher, it will be impossible to win.

It definitely isn't worth paying 18 bucks for it.Anyway, it is still one of the best racing arcades on the market.To conclude: If you had fun playing GRID - don't even bother installing GRID 2, have fun playing the original game If you had never played GRID - wait for sales or promo-actions and get GRID 2 "

												This game has a lot of quick races compared to Grid and there is an arcade type of feel. It lacks the cockpit view and is a blend of NFS underground, Dirt 2, and Grid. The Dirt 2 factor is an annoying announcer and goofy menus. Where this game shines is that it smacks down every NFS title on this platform. It lacks upgrades to vehicles but that can be forgiven due to the great exhaust sounds and eye candy. If you want longer races and better handling go pick up Grid. If you want some quicker racing and some drifting this is a great game. You may even prefer the handling it's just more arcadish and you can smack your car around a bit more. The DLC is mostly just more cars and this is where your upgrades were hidden. Oh you wanted to upgrade your ride like on NFS underground well that will be $4.99. It's still a bit pricey even when bundled together but it compliments a solid title.			"

												Very dated graphics, looks like need for speed most wanted (from way back in 2005). vehicle handling model is very simple and shallow, and of course very arcade. damage simulation is very primitive and not visually impressive. sound design is adequate, but nothing special. There is nothing very wrong with this game, but nothing right either, except maybe the re-wind function. I also had a few CTDs. This really feels like a yearly refresh to a franchise where the developer is just going through the motions to maintain the quarterly revenue. Oh, and it does not even have mouse support, you have to use keyboard for every menu (no big deal, but come on!).			"

												I was pretty disappointed with this one.  It gets by as a predictable and safe arcade racer, but that's about the best to be said about it.  The graphics and effects are OK.  The story mode is less cringey than many of its counterparts, but it still holds your hand a bit more than i care for.  The controls feel like a standard, mediocre arcade racer and don't do much to excite.I have a stability issue with the game that i haven't been able to resolve, which is that it crashes without fail about 15 minutes into every play session.  Others have this issue as well, but i have yet to be able to resolve it.  The game doesn't do enough to get me to keep attempting a fix anyway.Recently, i grabbed this game's predecessor, GRID, and was shocked to find that it is a better game in practically every way.  I enjoy it's UI more, it feels better optimized, it doesn't crash, the controls feel much better, the tracks are more fun and exciting, and it's story mode is less intrusive.If you're looking for a solid arcade racer, I would definitely suggest the original GRID over this one.If you enjoy a challenge and have a decent computer, definitely consider a game like Project Cars or Assetto Corsa over this series, as they go on sale frequently and have much more to offer.

												If you were expecting a an arcade/simulation hybrid or a semi-pro simulation... THIS ISNT IT. it is very arcade'y. After playing GTR2, shift2, iracing, hell even the first grid... GRID 2 was wayyyy to easy. as a sim fan i was driving passively thinking about what coffee i should brew once the race was over unlike a proper sim where you actually sweat and dare not lose focus!oh and i almost forgot... NO COCKPIT VIEW!.... LIKE WHAT!!!!????... SERIOUSLY!!!.... WHAAAAATTTT!!????visuals are beautiful though. and if you like some fun arcade racing... go for it.			"

Other than the cheaters, it is a fun game online. The store page should be edited to reflect the fact there is NO VAC or any type of anti-cheat in Grid 2. I still give it a 8/10 though. It is a good arade syle racing game, overall.			"

												Hi all,What can  I say? THis must be the worst excuse of a sequel I have seen in years. Technically solid with nice graphics and a lot of feel for the car, albeit very simcade-ish. But that is as far as the good goes. The bad: No real gameplay ala GRID. It's more of strung together orgy of races like Dirt or similar. No more raceteam of your own, no more spnsors to win, no more money to earn to buy cars etc etc. Grid 2 is a sub-par game. It is actually an insult to call this Grid at all. It has nothing in common with the original. Codemasters(yea I know the nameis a joke) proves yet again (after the F1 series) how able they are in dumbing down a formerly good concept and ruin the fun. Don't get me wrong, the driving is ok, but if the game around it fails then there is no purpose, no sense of achievement in actual fact there is not much left. 4/10 :(			"

												When I was 11, I bought a racing game called Gran Turismo for my Playstation Portable. Back then I couldn't tell the difference between a pickup truck and a Lamborghini (I'm exaggerating, but when it came to cars, I really did lack knowledge). I didn't have any interest of cars back then, just like every other kid, I liked Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft. Yeah that's right, I'm not afraid to tell the world that I used to like it! But after I bought that game, that one little racing game with over 800 cars, it changed my life, my perspective on how I saw the world around me. In no time, I became a car enthusiast, and switched to PC gaming. But I lost my Gran Turismo... and for 3 years I've never had a legitimate racing game. But then I bought this game. It took me a whole week to decide on buying this game. I had to break everything down, such as seeing the requirements, reading online reviews, and looking at gameplays. At first I thought to myself, ""I should probably save this game for an H1Z1 sale."" But then I thought back to Gran Tursimo days. After that, there was no stopping me from buying it. And then, after 2 hours of waiting for 6 GB to go through, while watching episodes of How I Met Your Mother... I launched it. I clicked on career mode and then I started my first race with the Ford Mustang Match 1. It was an amazing race and brought back so many memories of 11 year old me... Plus I had all the DLC for the game and had a lot of fun. Everything about this game is amazing! The graphics, the physics, the handling of the cars, it's all just so realistic! Despite the fact that this game only has a limited amount of cars everything else is amazing! And it has split-screen mode so if you want to challenge your friend to a race, you can! If you are a car enthusiast, I encourage you to get this game!			"

												The #1 Driving Simulator for the PC at present, far beyond the competition, and close behind Forza and Gran Turismo as the greatest Driving Sims ever made.Accurate cars and tracks, with excellent physics, each car has it's own charecteristics which are lost on a lot of PC driving games. Sure, it's like every other driving game, however it uses a range of tracks that aren't found in any other game, therefore keeping the game fresh and interesting.Turn the graphics up to ultra @1440p and then it really shines.

												Too slippery.No matter what car you chose and the road and weather conditions, your car will slide. The handling hardly differs between cars other than the fact that some are heavier than others. I wish they had put more work in realisticly simulating tire traction.There is absolutely no incentive to play the game in story more since you don't earn cash or rack up points towards unlocking cars. I hear there's an actual incentive to play the game online, but the servers are empty and no one's there.			"

												At first I didnt like this game, the races came thick n fast and didnt really give me time to enjoy it. I think if id of played the game on hard instead of normal then that wouldnt of been a problem. The graphics are awesome, better than the more recent driving game ive bought The Crew. I remember playing the original Grid and loving it and after finishing this I have to say once again im impressed. The driving style is a little arcadey but thats not such a bad thing for the mainstream... rather a good thing. Theres plenty of cars, which are all grouped up into tiers. The amount of tracks is acceptable although at times it seems you do race the same track once to often in a different race type or direction. Overall this is a great racing game, and I thoroughly reccommend it. If you can pick it up cheap, n play it on hard youre get hours of enjoyment. 8/10			"

												Following the impactful original Grid this game has some big shoes to fill. However, this game does an exeptional job of mantaining replayability and keeping with ""Grid"" and its addictive gameplay. This game does lack the classic arcade style of driving. In its attempt for realism this game fall hard in the specific aspect of drifting. While it is possible to get some long stretching drifts, the cars have a lack of feeling like the original grid. Despite this, ""Grid 2"" is an amazing game and I would sincerely recommend it.			"

												The successor of Race Driver: GRID is nowhere as good as the first game from the series but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad game. It still has some really good mechanics and absolutely great looking graphics. GRID2 contains a large amount of cars with various characteristics so players with different driving styles should be able to find something for themselves. Difficulty level of the game is pretty much unbalanced because on the same level some of the challenges are way too easy and some may cause serious problems. Unfortunately, there is also a small amount of race tracks and it's easy to get bored when you have to race on the same circuit over and over again. In overall the game is good but not great. Still, it's one of the best racing games you can find on PC and it's worth to give it a shot.			"

												Great Arcade racing game but not a true sequel to the original GRID in my opinion.. Yes, they've bumped up the Graphics and added more tracks, depth etc.. but it doesn't feel like a true GRID sequel due to the fact it's lacking different race categories. Where are race modes like Touge, Classic Muscle, Formula 3? Can recommend it but don't expect the same magic they've achieved with GRID.			"

												One of the greatest racing game. If you like that kind of games, you should think about try this one.I prefer the money system that we had in the previous game than the fan community system. But it is easier to have new cars.			"

												Multiplayer is FAR too troublesome to participate in. You have to change your download region to UK to find lobbies, then you find its full of latency because of the distance from where you are. DLC selectivly alienates the dwindling population because you have to own all the DLC that the lobby creater owns, and the 3 newest DLCs can't be used in online playlists. Region filtering could have been patched easily, but Codemasters never cared to fix the game.Single player is fun however. Pretty soon this game will be dead on multiplayer and that will be the only option. Only buy if you don't care about racing online.			"

												A step down from GRID. Codemasters continue their pattern of dumbing down their racing games in GRID 2.If you want an arcade racing game with voiceovers telling you how awesome you are when you win races, a ridiculous storyline and ads being pushed in your face, then this might be the game for you.The storyline removes almost any choice you have in how you play the game. There's no element of building your garage or team, as you're essentially a hired driver.In terms of driving, before release the developers boasted about removing assists, such as traction control. This isn't true, strictly speaking. What you have instead, is traction control that's permanently on - perhaps at a slightly lower level than in GRID. This totally undermines the drifting minigame (which was quite good in GRID), which is now ""pull handbrake on corner, and wait for car to auto-correct"", essentially.Certain cars will have the rear step out given the right conditions, but broadly speaking all the cars handle the same. There is a fairly wide selection of cars, but when they're all the same and you have around 20 cars to pick from for a race, there's no point in picking any of them, except the fastest one. Additionally, there are no interior views on the cars, like in GRID.The game looks great though. The cars and scenery are well modeled, and there's a very nice lighting system. Some of the new tracks, are also quite nice.Overall however, this is an outright worse game than GRID.If you like arcade racing, the original GRID is still quite a good game, flaws and all. If you're looking for a simulator, this certainly isn't the game for you.			"

Surprisingly disappointing.I should start by saying I do plan to continue trying to play this game. I really, really want it to be good, but so far it's been frustrating to no end. The driving physics seem like they could be decent, but all the cars you get in the start are ""Drift"" class, where drift apparently means ""Absolutely no road friction."" It's seriously impossible to keep them from sliding. Now, this is bad enoungh on its own, but the A.I. is pretty much completely oblivious to your presence on the track with them, and has no qualms about ramming into you at any speed or position. Not only that, but they don't slide like you do. Ever. So instead of a crash where everyone is screwed up, they drive happily on by while you go careening off into a wall, left at the utter back of the pack. I thought we'd mastered A.I. that tries to avoid collisions in racing games, someone should really let Codemasters know. I should also note that I play with a racing wheel, so I should have the sort of fine control to avoid these things (and can in other games) but apparently that's meaningless here. I don't often ragequit games of any type, but when I do, apparently the game is GRID 2.TL:DR version:Good:-Game looks and runs great-Slick menus and dialog like most other Codemasters racing titles-Wheel support is great, you can feel the weight of the car and the road easily-Decent career modeBad-Game forces you into crappy cars with no grip-A.I. isn't subject to the same forces as you (they have seemingly infinite traction)-A.I. doesn't avoid collisions in the slightest, will run you off the road and laugh-No cockpit view (Seriously? Why?)I really, really hope I can at least get some cars with traction later into the game, but for them to force you to drive like a madman and then punish you for driving like a madman at the start of the game is stupid. Then again, Codemasters did decide that making an entire game out of the terrible Gymkhana events from DiRT 3 was a good idea... I guess they're going downhill.			"

												Grid 2 is an excellent and diverse racing game, I totally recommend it. Pro:- offers way more than 30 hours in the career mode. It features many different race types, such as endurance, time attack, head to head duels etc. There are fie seasons and four different vehicle tiers. As you proress toward world fame, you get vehicle challenges to obtain the more expensive cars. - nice enviroments and car models. They actually break, get damaged and this influences the driving. They are not as detailed as in Forza, but from behind it is fine. There are many locations, both in Europe, Asia and in the USA. - each car drives different. The developers really put the emphasis on car handling. You can feel them, especially through a controller. - Splitscreen mode is really fun. Contra:-no cockpit view!!!- in normal difficulty and above the AI is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. It bumps into you in the corners - and everywhere else -  resulting in a spin out, accelerates to unreal speed if it wants to catch up with you and just before the finish line it goes hardcore and tries to ♥♥♥♥ you up. It was programmed so there is ALWAYS a driver who launches at the start like a russian torpedo, goes on the perfect lines. Then there's the next three driver, who often tend to race in a pack way in front of the rest. Problem is, you start at the very back of each race so going through all these idiots can be not only challenging but often frustrating. - the radio guy is a moron. - car customization isn't deep enough. You can change only the tires, the rest is all about paint and sponsors. - I found only one bug but it was awkward, in Dubai at a night race the ligths started to flash like a strobe and I could barely drive safely because of that. It's a great game with some minor annoying aspects, but mostly these can be solved by setting the difficulty to easy.			"

												After I played this game for 5 months since lauch in the first day, here's what I gotGood :1. Graphics Optimization = Graphics is looks good and run great even in low settings and it's laptop friendly. my 3 years old laptop can still run this with Low-Mid settings.2. Pretty good online mode = It's great and fun to play in my opinion (if it doesn't have the terrible drivers who hit me in the first corner and annoying voice chat.)3. Variety of cars = a lot of car selection to drive.4. LiveRoutes system.5. Soundtracks.Bad :1. Cockpit camera view is missing. and this is the huge mistake.2. Too overpriced DLCs3. No text chat in online mode.4. Terrible replay cameras. and it's had the worst replays camera compared to all Codemasters racing games in the past.5. Career Mode (Can't create the team name, no teammate system, race to earn the ""fans"" ?)6. Le Mans 24 hours event is missing.7. Drift events is terrible and so boring compared to the first GRID. (and the freestyle drift and full-lap drift mode is missing too. only point-to-point drift.)8. A.I. in Single Player are too rude especially in Season 5 even you set it on medium difficulty.GRID 2 is still the fun and enjoyable racing games with the variety of cars, beautiful scenary and mix of challenges. but if compared this to the first Race Driver : GRID, this is the dissappointment sequel because a lot of great feature that in the first game doesn't featured in this sequel.7/10(Sorry for my bad english skill and grammar.)

												My cable provider prevented me from watching ESPN. But thanks to GRID 2, I can now catch up with the latest news on Sportscenter.10/10 would buy again to make the cable provider♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants.EDIT: After taking 15 hrs to complete the Single Player, here's a more serious review:PROS:+ Long Single Player mode (easily 15 hrs+ if you complete every single event)+ Nice and wide selection of cars. Ranges from hypercars to the good old Silvia+ Presentation and UI. Clean and to the point with no unnecessary fuss. One thing I hate about racing games is the way they flash updates in the center of the screen. This one doesn't do that.+ Sound Design. Seriously, the best I found in a game. Engine noise changes if you lose the  exhaust and the engineer's radio transmissions become muffled when you are racing under a tunnel. Music is a bit on the relaxing and trance side which I kinda like but lacks the oomph required in a normal racing game+ Dat Red Hot brake discs tho. Nice attention to detail.CONS:- Gets repetitive.- NO COCKPIT CAM- Story is meh meh. By the time I reched Season 5 I was forcing myself to see if there was a nice ending.- Handling. Cars handle like the original GRID in drift mode. Too arcadey but I liked it for the first few hours of gameplay- Damage. The way the chassis sometimes bends with knocks and crashes is just unrealistic. After the really awesome and life like damage modelling in the original one, don't know what exactly happened here. BOTTOMLINE:Prepare yourself for a arcade game in a simulation setting to really enjoy GRID 2. There is no relation between this and the original. If you're lookin for something more motorsports career oriented like with teams you're better off with the original GRID or GRID Autosport (which is bloody awesome imho)			"

												As Grid was the greatest racing game of a generation, Codemasters has done it again by taking that greatness and reworked it as a successor from the ground up. Grid is no longer that benchmark. Grid 2 is. THIS is by far, the greatest racing game I've ever played. Pure adrenaline, high-octane action which doesn't let up until you've crossed that finish line. Make no mistake; there is NO rubberbanding from the AI in this game. You wanna win and claim 1st? FIGHT FOR IT, because the AI will work just as hard as you do to be there: Trading paint, slicing corners, braking risky turns and burning off every inch of asphalt on those treacherous straight aways.Come to think of it, this is more than a racing game. This is an experience. Just as Skyrim has done for RPGs, Grid 2 has done for racers. To oversimplify the fact: this is the Dark Souls equivalent of racing. A challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that will captivate you again and again behind every wheel of every car you take to the pavement.Incredible sound design, outstanding controls which truly make you feel like you are behind the wheel of every car you drive, and the reactive environments you race in: no two races EVER feel the same and I would be hard pressed to believe anyone who claims otherwise.If you've never played Grid, now is the time to acclimate yourself to the one and only racer that might just be the only thing truest to the form.Trust me. This is one HELL of a game!			"

It doens't happen anywhere else, so it isn't an issue with the keyboard. Until this is fixed (which I think it never will be), this game is near unplayable, because the keys WILL jam in the most vital moments of the race.**Game's too hard now.			"

												If you're looking for a racing game that's looking great, easy accessible and delivers a ton of fun right from the start, this is the game for you. It's a pure and satisfying arcade racer with imho the best xbox360 controls I've ever seen yet. The AI drivers are well balanced and tend to be more fair than aggressiv. Grid 1 was a ""crash party"" for me most of the time in this regard especially because you've got too less time to really reach the top without driving like an insane psychopath yourself. Grid 2 feels quite different, way less insane, though it becomes harder and harder to catch the #1 while you progress through the events. Still I wish (career) races would last longer with more rounds, I always have the feeling that the race is already over when it just gets really fun. (I played a few true racings sims in the past with considerably longer races, it just makes it way more intense). But this is a complaint I have with arcade racers in general besides not beeing sims anyway ;-)Missing cockpits - everyone has them today, even arcade racers. But the game is still pretty fun without them.DLC, way to go today it seems. Questionable but I'm to tired to get upset. Take it or leave it.			"

I have enjoyed the franchise so far, this second GRID game has a more arcade feel to it, but it's not enough to detract from my experience.  For those looking for a complete racing simulator, this isn't for you.  But for those looking for a fun, fast-paced racing game, look no further.  It's got a wide selection of cars which you can customize the livery and rims on.  While the tracks are limitied, it does help you with memorizing them (like real race car drivers do).  Overall, it's a fun game to burn up some time.			"

												Made entirely for the energy drink-chugging, short attention-spanned crowd who think that racing is all about simply putting your foot down. Get Asseto Corsa or rFactor 2 instead of this rubbish.			"

												Great tracks, great cars, great graphics. Physics is debatable, but great game overall.*Recently, there have been issues with the keys not registering/keys getting jammed. It was a common problem for users with the Logitech G110 gaming keyboard (myself included), as well as some Microsoft Sidewinder at first, but now, it's happening to my new Logitech G710+ mechanical keyboard too. It doens't happen anywhere else, so it isn't an issue with the keyboard. Until this is fixed (which I think it never will be), this game is near unplayable, because the keys WILL jam in the most vital moments of the race.**Game's too hard now.			"

												If you're looking for a racing game that's looking great, easy accessible and delivers a ton of fun right from the start, this is the game for you. It's a pure and satisfying arcade racer with imho the best xbox360 controls I've ever seen yet. The AI drivers are well balanced and tend to be more fair than aggressiv. Grid 1 was a ""crash party"" for me most of the time in this regard especially because you've got too less time to really reach the top without driving like an insane psychopath yourself. Grid 2 feels quite different, way less insane, though it becomes harder and harder to catch the #1 while you progress through the events. Still I wish (career) races would last longer with more rounds, I always have the feeling that the race is already over when it just gets really fun. (I played a few true racings sims in the past with considerably longer races, it just makes it way more intense). But this is a complaint I have with arcade racers in general besides not beeing sims anyway ;-)Missing cockpits - everyone has them today, even arcade racers. But the game is still pretty fun without them.DLC, way to go today it seems. Questionable but I'm to tired to get upset. Take it or leave it.			"

												Grid 2... is different. If you buy it expecting a similar game to grid 1 or gran turismo you might get disappointed. It's a really fun game, specially if you are into the ""Initial-D"" series, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.Pros:-Beatiful graphics-Drifters paradise, with great physics for that-Great selection of cars-No glitches-Overall just really fun, specially multiplayerContras:-Not much of a simulator (if you are expecting that)-A lot of DLCs (almost required if you plan to play online)-No cockpit view or rearside mirror-Story mode is kinda short and not really interesting-Dumb AIIf you still have any doubts about it, here's a video that may make up your mind:

												This is a ""fun"" and good ""driving"" game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t. In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games). There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that. The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again ""BANG MOTHERF*UCKER"", you have crashed again.Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.			"

I just tried playing NFS Shift after 150 hrs of this, and it feels like crap now. Now I just wish they would design a game campaign like Forza 4 or Gran Turismo 5, but using this graphics\physics engine. Then include tracks like Bathurst, Nurburgring\Nordschleife etc, and all the production and tuner cars like in GT.

												Its got your typical NFS style arcade racing gameplay. The graphics and tracks are stunning, the damage on cars is realistic as it gets. Just staring at the cars itself worth the game, the amount of attention to detail is great. The only con would be that it gets a bit repetitive even though it actually has a variety of race modes, don't expect to have a storyline that keeps you hooked either. It has a season style racing career just like Forza series on the Xbox. Very few people who play this game online as well. Overall a 7/10			"

												The lack of cockpit view is not missed since this is an arcade racer through and through.What is really great about Grid 2 (sp) is the lack of vehicle modding and customisation. The focus is purely on racing and the lack of upgrades means that you get really tense and challenging races.Graphics are superb and if you have a decent card the game is spectacular in eyefinity and isn't too demanding so you don't need SLI.I pre-ordered when it first came available on steam. There were a few things that I hated about the meta-game (career sp), for example, the animation that counts your fans after each race was un-skippable. I gave codemasters feedback about aspects that could be improved and they were implemented soon after in a patch!

												To me this game feels like it's DiRT 3 on pavement, which is exactly what I was hoping for, i'd say around 65% arcade the rest sim, the tracks and cars are awesome. GreenManGaming had this game for prepurchase for $33 with 1 DLC pack and it's worth full price. Again Codemasters EGO engine is perfect, looks gorgeous and it's smooth as butter. Multiplayer is pretty addicting and I like the unlocking system they're using, makes you ""look forward"" to more and more stuff. If you want a mix of arcade/sim racing games look into Codemasters titles, good stuff.			"

												Great looking racer with beautiful tracks, especially Paris and Barcelona. Becomes very challenging after finishing season 3 in single player. Picking the right car for a track to have a chance is a science. Fun multiplayer if your not involved in the inevitable mass crash in the first corner of each course and the majority of opponents is not 20 levels above your own :)			"

												If you're just the average gamer looking for a fun racing game, this is a great option.  The physics aren't ultra realistic like racing simulators, but they're better than the basic arcade games like Need for Speed or Burnout.  It can be extremely challenging to nail a corner perfect, but the cars are very forgiving if you make mistakes.  If you like the DiRT games, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the Grid games too.

												My cable provider prevented me from watching ESPN. But thanks to GRID 2, I can now catch up with the latest news on Sportscenter.10/10 would buy again to make the cable provider♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants.EDIT: After taking 15 hrs to complete the Single Player, here's a more serious review:PROS:+ Long Single Player mode (easily 15 hrs+ if you complete every single event)+ Nice and wide selection of cars. Ranges from hypercars to the good old Silvia+ Presentation and UI. Clean and to the point with no unnecessary fuss. One thing I hate about racing games is the way they flash updates in the center of the screen. This one doesn't do that.+ Sound Design. Seriously, the best I found in a game. Engine noise changes if you lose the  exhaust and the engineer's radio transmissions become muffled when you are racing under a tunnel. Music is a bit on the relaxing and trance side which I kinda like but lacks the oomph required in a normal racing game+ Dat Red Hot brake discs tho. Nice attention to detail.CONS:- Gets repetitive.- NO COCKPIT CAM- Story is meh meh. By the time I reched Season 5 I was forcing myself to see if there was a nice ending.- Handling. Cars handle like the original GRID in drift mode. Too arcadey but I liked it for the first few hours of gameplay- Damage. The way the chassis sometimes bends with knocks and crashes is just unrealistic. After the really awesome and life like damage modelling in the original one, don't know what exactly happened here. BOTTOMLINE:Prepare yourself for a arcade game in a simulation setting to really enjoy GRID 2. There is no relation between this and the original. If you're lookin for something more motorsports career oriented like with teams you're better off with the original GRID or GRID Autosport (which is bloody awesome imho)			"

												As Grid was the greatest racing game of a generation, Codemasters has done it again by taking that greatness and reworked it as a successor from the ground up. Grid is no longer that benchmark. Grid 2 is. THIS is by far, the greatest racing game I've ever played. Pure adrenaline, high-octane action which doesn't let up until you've crossed that finish line. Make no mistake; there is NO rubberbanding from the AI in this game. You wanna win and claim 1st? FIGHT FOR IT, because the AI will work just as hard as you do to be there: Trading paint, slicing corners, braking risky turns and burning off every inch of asphalt on those treacherous straight aways.Come to think of it, this is more than a racing game. This is an experience. Just as Skyrim has done for RPGs, Grid 2 has done for racers. To oversimplify the fact: this is the Dark Souls equivalent of racing. A challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that will captivate you again and again behind every wheel of every car you take to the pavement.Incredible sound design, outstanding controls which truly make you feel like you are behind the wheel of every car you drive, and the reactive environments you race in: no two races EVER feel the same and I would be hard pressed to believe anyone who claims otherwise.If you've never played Grid, now is the time to acclimate yourself to the one and only racer that might just be the only thing truest to the form.Trust me. This is one HELL of a game!			"

												This is a ""fun"" and good ""driving"" game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t. In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games). There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that. The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again ""BANG MOTHERF*UCKER"", you have crashed again.Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.			"

												So I noticed today that GRID 2 was free on steam for the next two days. I haven't played any racing games in a while, and figured I would give this one a shot. So after waiting for it to download, and the lengthy load time - I see a cut scene of chicago that takes like 3 minutes to run through, until it finally zoomed into the car and then froze. Had to try to CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill the task, which did not work. It still said it was opened and froze everything on that monitor, thankfully I have two monitors. I get my computer to the point I see that everything else I try to open freezes as well and it will not kill the task, so it looks like restarting the system is my only option. Tell my system to restart and the windows restart comes up, and tells me that it needs to force steam (grid) to close. Fine. System restart then locks up as well. Ugh, this is the first game to freeze my system in well over a year. I think to myself, well that was annoying glitch, lets try this again. GOD DAMMIT SAME THING HAPPENS. 20 minutes later, I think I'm just uninstalling this bad boy. Kudos to being the first game to ever lock up my system so horribly though.			"

												Absolute dogshit.... for me.If you like Need for Speed Hot Pursuit (201X whatever) then you'll probably like this.  There is incentives to drift, things that will make your post 2000 baby self giggle, Honda NSX is considered a drift car.  There is only one car that is ""GRIP"" that you can drive that makes the driving tolerable.The introduction made me want to vomit.  They tell you to drift in a RACE, they tell you how many ""cameraphones are on you,"" show your video uploaded and ""liked"" and then you get an achievemnt after a scout calls you that says ""call me maybe."" This will forever be on my record and it makes me sick.This is an arcade game for YOUTHS.  YOU RUINED THIS FOR ME!!!!!!Now back to F1 2010 for me.Oh and were you thinking of just doing a Raceday?  You have a Mustand(Drift),Challenger(Drift), randomly and Alpha Romeo(Grip THANK GOD), and a Honda NSX-R(.....drift).  Oh you were thinking that NSX-R sounded like fun it's artificially drifty, and it rockets you into walls because it thought you were starting the turn when your tail slides out at the end. (Soft/Hard Drift Lock).  However when you look at your cars, you can buy them sold separately DLC :)Was Codemasters even involved in this game?ABSOLUTE DOGSHIT.			"

												Multiplayer is FAR too troublesome to participate in. You have to change your download region to UK to find lobbies, then you find its full of latency because of the distance from where you are. DLC selectivly alienates the dwindling population because you have to own all the DLC that the lobby creater owns, and the 3 newest DLCs can't be used in online playlists. Region filtering could have been patched easily, but Codemasters never cared to fix the game.Single player is fun however. Pretty soon this game will be dead on multiplayer and that will be the only option. Only buy if you don't care about racing online.			"

Codemasters continue their pattern of dumbing down their racing games in GRID 2.If you want an arcade racing game with voiceovers telling you how awesome you are when you win races, a ridiculous storyline and ads being pushed in your face, then this might be the game for you.The storyline removes almost any choice you have in how you play the game. There's no element of building your garage or team, as you're essentially a hired driver.In terms of driving, before release the developers boasted about removing assists, such as traction control. This isn't true, strictly speaking. What you have instead, is traction control that's permanently on - perhaps at a slightly lower level than in GRID. This totally undermines the drifting minigame (which was quite good in GRID), which is now ""pull handbrake on corner, and wait for car to auto-correct"", essentially.Certain cars will have the rear step out given the right conditions, but broadly speaking all the cars handle the same. There is a fairly wide selection of cars, but when they're all the same and you have around 20 cars to pick from for a race, there's no point in picking any of them, except the fastest one. Additionally, there are no interior views on the cars, like in GRID.The game looks great though. The cars and scenery are well modeled, and there's a very nice lighting system. Some of the new tracks, are also quite nice.Overall however, this is an outright worse game than GRID.If you like arcade racing, the original GRID is still quite a good game, flaws and all. If you're looking for a simulator, this certainly isn't the game for you.			"

												Pathetically bad... It is horribly optimized forcing my SLI GPU's up to max temperatures and stutters and lags despite 16gbs of ram and an 8core CPU. The game is laughably bad. It has some cringey youtube superstar plot line and ""driving"" feels completely fake and feathery.			"

												Just had a little go playing through the first few maps and my first impression isn't good. Lacks the balanced realism and variety of play mastered by titles such as PGR and the early Burnout games. Also not to keen on the voiceovers, very irritating.All that said, it's a good challenge and it looks amazing in 1080p. I won't be keeping this game after the free weekend but there are some who might enjoy it.			"

												Absolute dogshit.... for me.If you like Need for Speed Hot Pursuit (201X whatever) then you'll probably like this.  There is incentives to drift, things that will make your post 2000 baby self giggle, Honda NSX is considered a drift car.  There is only one car that is ""GRIP"" that you can drive that makes the driving tolerable.The introduction made me want to vomit.  They tell you to drift in a RACE, they tell you how many ""cameraphones are on you,"" show your video uploaded and ""liked"" and then you get an achievemnt after a scout calls you that says ""call me maybe."" This will forever be on my record and it makes me sick.This is an arcade game for YOUTHS.  YOU RUINED THIS FOR ME!!!!!!Now back to F1 2010 for me.Oh and were you thinking of just doing a Raceday?  You have a Mustand(Drift),Challenger(Drift), randomly and Alpha Romeo(Grip THANK GOD), and a Honda NSX-R(.....drift).  Oh you were thinking that NSX-R sounded like fun it's artificially drifty, and it rockets you into walls because it thought you were starting the turn when your tail slides out at the end. (Soft/Hard Drift Lock).  However when you look at your cars, you can buy them sold separately DLC :)Was Codemasters even involved in this game?ABSOLUTE DOGSHIT.			"

												Probably the best arcade racing game. I repeat it: an arcade racing game! The same ""swimming"" controls, even with a steering wheel - that's why I say it's an arcade game. Don't expect a serious real simulation, and you'll like it. Better graphics than Race Driver: GRID, more cars, more tracks. It's still great fun online after so many hours. I recommend it, 9/10!			"

												Too slippery.No matter what car you chose and the road and weather conditions, your car will slide. The handling hardly differs between cars other than the fact that some are heavier than others. I wish they had put more work in realisticly simulating tire traction.There is absolutely no incentive to play the game in story more since you don't earn cash or rack up points towards unlocking cars. I hear there's an actual incentive to play the game online, but the servers are empty and no one's there.			"

												Grid 2 is a blast to play, at first. That being said it is an outdated game that fails to live up to the hype or pedigree of its predecessor. While the controls are extremely tight (xbox360 controller) the game never truly finds its identity. With a familiar focus on youtube, much like the recent entries in the DiRT series, and a strong single player story experience, the first few hours are a gem. However, soon the driving becomes stale, pushed by the idea that every turn can be expertly drifted. Drifting is not easy and requires a delicate balance of countersteer and throttle managment, but once you've got it down it becomes second nature. You will be drifting alot. You will also be learning many of the turns very quickly. Tracks are built on just a few maps, with a few variations of the lap. There is notably a new race type where the lap changes on the fly. Its a really cool concept, but the variation is so low, after one of these races, you'll generally know map very well. Grid 2 also lacks any difficulty settings other than AI. The enviornments are gorgeous, however the cars look about as good as Need for Speed Shift 2.  The car list is populated by stellar choices, but it is very small considering what Gran Turismo and Forza have been offering for years. I also found myself unable to attach myself to any of the vehicles. Being unable to customize any performance acspects of the cars, I ended up using a car for a short time then moving on, never to return to my previous choice. While Grid 2 definitely finds itself in the middle of the sim/arcade racer spectrum, that is also my biggest gripe. Drifting is fun, but it is not the end all of racing. Maybe I've been spoiled by other racing games in the past, but I've come to expect more. More cars, more customization, more tracks, more difficulty settings, more fun. The ironic part is that the ""story"" is brilliantly done, and truly gives the player a sense of progression, which is very new to the racing genre.  Also worth noting is the inclusion of split screen, which is almost unheard of in pc gaming now.			"

												I think its best to start with the good in reviews.. there isnt many in this game, but I feel I should still try. this game, is by far the weakest one I played, I was sure it was going to be amazing because of the great graphics, awesome cars and even more amazing crash physics, but I always wondered why the physics were not the spotlight when shown in trailers, today I learned why; this game tends to focus on realism more than fun, wanna smash into cars? you might get penilized, what about if you wanna go faster than 90 miles and hour? good luck missing a wheel after you hit a treeand they must of even realized how bad the game was, because they gave a freaking oops-button, where you reverse time and start from a point of the race where you arent about to die.I got this in a bundle, and even with that in mind, its still a not really good game, if you get it on sale, it could be a good game to pickup, but otherwise its a flop and not really worth your time, I would urge you to try other MUCH MORE fun things like burnout paradise or race toy cars on the playground, atleast you can feel like your speeding while enjoying it.

 Positive + With a different career experience this time ‘round, the more story-focused single-player feels a lot more fleshed out than its predecessor. Feeling like a driving personality rather than a member of a team makes the solo experience much more memorable and charming. Clocking in at around 11 hours, the career mode is easily long enough to satisfy gamers who enjoy a bit of character with their driving experience+ Again, just like the first game, the handling strikes the perfect balance between simulation and arcade. While I will admit there is a bit more of a learning curve when it comes to oversteering (especially when it comes to drift events), and less customisation when it comes to driving assists, there’s still no denying that the driving is as fun as ever+ Different to the first game however, this game seems to focus a bit more on street circuits, as a lot of the newly added tracks take place in city streets rather than strictly closed-off racing circuits. This does give the game a slightly more arcade aesthetic than the previous game, but for me it didn’t really detract from the experience at all (though people who prefer simulation games may be put off by this)+ Compared to its predecessor, the graphics here are a definite step up. Every positive graphical aspect that was in the first game has been touched up and been given even more polish (though the bloom effect is a tad excessive). Negative - While the game does have a lengthy career, compared to the first game, there is a noticeable lack of variety in the courses. While the game does add a good amount of new tracks, it also reuses quite a lot from the previous game, which does hurt the total amount of different and unique tracks that you can race on- The same audio problem that existed in the first game is still present here, in terms of the in-game dialogue getting boring and repetitive. If that was an issue for you before, not much has changed unfortunately (though I do prefer the voice actor more so this time around). Worth Mentioning • Codemasters decided to remove the in-car view in this entry of the series. Personally, I have never used this view in a driving game, so the absence of this did not phase me at all. However, if you are the sort of person who does play their driving games using that view, then you will be disappointed in this aspect (though there is a community mod that adds an in-car view if you want to check that out first). Verdict “Just like its predecessor, GRID 2 is another highly enjoyable and fun racing game. While some people may be put off by the game feeling more arcade-like than the first one, for me, it didn’t deter me from playing the game at all. Another great driving experience!” 8.5/10 TJBs  "

												I Don't Care with negative review , but for me this game has good gameplay and graphic. i preffer to use controller than keyboard , playing singleplayer with hard or medium difficulty is enough for me with full damage on for more challenging.still better than The Crew,since the game called ""MMO"" even the player limit per session just 8 with big map. when beta i can't even play race with other playerso i think for graphic and race atmosphere Grid 2 is good choice for playing			"

												THis game has its problems with Windows 10. It is standard racing as so many others, and as this is the case, there is a logical conclusion considering the trouble it causes to get it to run, i.e. not to recommend it at any rate. It can take a lot of time to adjust the GPU to GRID 2, what should be done automatically and correctly, but isn't on Windows 10. Asking the developers, they do not intend to make a patch. After a while, even if the GPU is fine with Windows 10 then, the sound may still be stuttering and terribly irritating,  kind of terror for the ears. As has been said before, there are a lot of very similar games out there. Better catching those.			"

												Not bad. I got it on sale and Im glad I tried this before buying the newer and more expensive Grid: Autosport. This is more of an arcade style racer than a simulator. When I think racing simulator I instantly think Gran Tourismo or even Assetto Corsa. Its still a great game but the only tweaking you will be doing to your car is placing sponsor decals and other aesthetics.All in all, its fairly easy to play. Newcomers to driving games can probably master the controls very soon while seasoned racers will be able to come in and start with a bang. One thing I love, is there seem to be a lot of short races. I was (and still am) a Gran Tourismo junkie. But what I always hated about taht game was in order to complete 100% of the game you had to do the extremely long, marathon style races. Some take hours and hours to finish. Im not sure if Grid has any of those but it doesnt seem to be that type of game. GT only has them because it tries to be a true simulator.Im not crazy about the focus on drifting with every single car/class. While I dont mind drifting, I think drifting capable cars (and those amde jsut for drifting) fall into a different class than all of the other cars available. Matter of fact, drift cars and that style of racing, belongs to a small minority. But in most racing games now, they tend to add drifting into the game no matter tha car or track style. Well, thats not always the best way to drive a track. Also, your car type really matters when it comes to sliding around. In Grid, so far, Ive even been expected to drift an old Dodge Charger in a ""takeover"" style race while simultaneously racing against a clock. Well, I may be sliding the rear-end out to get around some turns, but Im not going to be holding a full-on drift. The car is too heavy, tires spin too much, and I wouldnt be able to accelerate out of the turn enough to make up for lost time in the drift. But then here is what makes it an arcade racer and not a simulator...my acceleration and grip coming out the turn (while drifting) was perfectly fine. A real simulator wouldnt allow that to occur.As an Arcade style racer its great. When properly placed into the category I literally have no complaints. Due to certain graphics and the fact that some of the menu layouts are poor, I would give this an 8/10 in the arcade racer category.			"

												Jumping in to this right on the trail of completing Grid 1 took a little getting used to. This is not the same game as the original, It feels completely different. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, this is a very competent and fun racing game. The handling model is a lot more arcade based to the point where you mostly drift round corners even in grip class cars. This is sometimes fun to just sling your car round a corner but sometimes it can be frustrating with cars often sliding out of contol and straight into a wall. Where this game really shines is the design, this game is visually stunning and the audio for the cars is great. You can take some amazing screenshots of this game on nearly any track. It does still let you down in some bits like having no cockpit cam and the voice over constantly yapping in your ear can get very annoying, thankfully both these problems can be altered with mods. To me this game was just as good as the last and I was surprised to find it as good as I did after hearing countless people tell me it was crap. 8.5/10			"

												I will give this title a fair rating and even though i liked the play through there are some cons that can not be overlooked.- Fanboys seem to downvote anything negative. Just same as COD or Miscreated, it destroys a fair trial- Overimpressive physics: Or did you think you can give a car a 13 times side spin when hitting the wall in Hong kong before touching the ground. Also whenever you hit the side, Rocks won't stop you but signs can send you flinging around. - Sloppy controls: My G27 wheel and my Xbox controller show 15°+ dead angle, which is nowadays impossible in cars.   If there is a game where it does not matter what you use to play with, then this one.- Drifting mechanic: Some cars just will slide like crazy and others stick to the ground like Carrera cars and still it has nothing to do with aerodynamics, weight or which wheel is driven.- Generally funny behaivor of actual super cars that have to go slower in corners than a 40 year old car, specially seen at the Koenigsegg Agrea R, which is plain unraceable (similar to Testdrive 2)- Repetetive Tracks with around 12 Locations, where many corners got copied several times (Chicago, Miami, ...)- Too expensive DLCs with mostly only slightly tuned cars from those which are already in. Any DLC car can be ignored for racing either in carreer or online. - Unfair competition as the AI seem not to care or see the player and rams it, sending only the player to fling around or being highly damaged.- AI seem not to compete with each other and does only change the average speed with different setting but not the actual skill.- Online multiplayer is already quite deadHere some good stuff:+ Acknowledged my G27 racing wheel but only with semi automatic+ Lovely made cars and generally good graphics+ Story mode feels very tempting and rewarding+ No endless trials thanks to time line, variable difficulty, run backs, no economy,...+ Split screen multiplayer is getting rare nowadaysAnyway get this on sale without DLCs then you can enjoy some hours, as this is one of the never ending arcarde racers that can really be a pain once you'll get to it's end.

												I DO recommend this, but DONT go into this thinking its a sim! The handling is very unrealistic, in contrast with the graphics.The handling model is very far from a sim, unlike the original Race Driver Grid and sequel Grid Autosport, which are both somewhat simlike, but still very accessible.If you know what you're getting into (ie. an arcade racer), there's nothing to stop you having a great time. Yes, the quickest way round a corner is drifting with the back-end almost overtaking you, which is quite an odd sensation due to the very realistic and beautiful visuals, especially in something like the track oriented Caterham SP/300.R.

												GRID 2 is one if the best racing games I've ever played. The Codemasters engine provides a very pleasant driving experience and stunning graphics (R9 390X - Ultra @60FPS). Single player career takes about 20 hours to complete with Easy opponents, if you complete all the races. Multiplayer mode is also a lot of fun, haven't come across cheating opponents yet. A Highly Recommended Game to all car-lovers.Would play the SP career over and over.			"

												OK, so let me tell you about the one aspect of GRID 2 that was irritating enough for me to stop playing it for a few weeks, and then when I came back to it, irritating enough, again, to uninstall it for good.I am well aware that pretty much every racing game uses ""tournament"" modes to prolong gameplay hours.That's fine with me.But GRID 2 takes that concept to a ridiculous level.You have the Touge and Faceoff ""tournaments"".Here's how they work:You need to win a 1-on-1 race. Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK.I will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a ""hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row"" brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves.So yes, I'm thumbing this game down in my review because of this very idea, which in my personal opinion, completely broke the otherwise nearly-perfect arcade racer for me.

												Just bought on special, wish I had not bothered. I am sure if you stick with it you can get some enjoyment out of it, but for me I if dont gel with the experience fairly rapidly its all over and after half hour fannying about with it, I hate it.Such as, jumps you right into a race, no chance to check your options for graphics etc, which I find pretty weird to be honest, so I had to wait untl the 'it takes forever' intros and long winded cut scenes at the start of the game/race, none of which I managed to avoid or kill, then wait for the race to start, and then pause the race just to modify options such as resolutions, vsync etc...very crappy...Controls, supremely crappy, its way way way, way, too slippy out there, and I play Dirt 3 so I dont mind some drifting, but this was just ridiculous, and of course, at this stage (dont know if you can later on) there is no obvious way to modify the vehicle setup so you can at least try to get it to work with the way you like drive in game.Other stuff that started to annoy me, what a load of long winded blah blah blah from the commentary about how you can youtube your progress and how awesome you are, blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah, no obvious way to stop it in game, I just wanted to say please please just shut up and sod off, an option to just cut past the scene/voiceover by pressing esc or something would be fantastic, but couldnt find one and kept pressing any buttons on my controller and keyboard in the hope could kill the story teller. Also I didnt do the raceday, which you are offered right after doing the first race, and being told how awesome you are even if you♥♥♥♥♥♥it up, and despite this, the game still behaved like I had done it, and numbed me yet again with some more background chat and story telling blah blah blah, blah blah blah, for gods sake please please please shut up and go away...Ooh and of course theres the crashing, and I dont mean into other cars, I mean program, just stops working and you find yourself dumped back out onto your desktop...Theres just so much i dislike about this experience at the outset that I just dont want to play it again, I could probably get used to all the drifting, but whats the point, I may as well just play a rally style game, and I just cant bear the thought of having to go through all that mind numbing commentary, what an utter waste of cash and an hour of my time...and did I mention it crashes too? Maybe autosport is better, i dont know, but im not wasting my cash on it to find out.Some folks obviously get on ok with this game and enjoy it, not for me though...I should have spent the cash on a mighty bucket for one...Ive requested a refund as I just cannot bring myself to try it again...

												One my favourite racing simulators, that plays and looks amazing via Windows OS 8 using DirectX 11Only really bad part is, it's uses CodeMasters own network for all sync/on-line stuff and not Steam, which is rather slow, but worst of all it only uses Facebook rubbish and no Google+ connectivity, which is awful, but avoidable at least.The above issues are also found in F1 Race Stars, which is equally brilliant, but also plagued by the same issues!*2/3* - One mark lost for rubbish network usage and very limiting connectivity options			"

												Okay here we goPC Port:The PC Port is amazing! There is a reason that in a lot of graphics card benchmarks they use Grid 2, the game is optimized very well on PC. I've had no issues, no crashes, no Games for Windows Live, no issues with menus or anything at all. Grid 2 is an example of a PC port done right!The Game:You start in a little garage with no fans or anything, then you have to get better, gain more fans and then you'll get a better garage! I really enjoy the progression in this game and it had me hooked for hours.A lot of people complain about how the cars handle compared to Grid 1, in fact almost everyone complains about that.I haven't played Grid 1 but I really like the Grid 2 handling. Obviously the cars dont handle realisticly or anything like that but they're very much fun to drive in. For its price this game is an amazing PC Racing game! You should defenetly check it out.  "

												Like most games coming out of Codemasters in the past years it's a bland product.Everything is dumbed down, great features removed leaving you feeling a bit lackluster.This is a very good looking piece of turd. Shiny and shapely but still have a bad stench around it.I knew I shouldn't have bought it and yet I did. I promised myself back in 2009 with the horrendous release of Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, promising and advertising game critical functions that wasn't in the released product.Yet I have bought worse and worse versions of F1 and Dirt.Let codemasters release their crap for kids on consoles but as for delivering a good PC game, thats over and done with.Also DLC!! Are you for real, most if not all of that♥♥♥♥♥♥should be in the game from the start. 64Euros worth of DLC for a 40euro game should be punishable under some better business act or something.Stay away from codemasters and their 100euro products, support 10 indie developers instead!

												No, my screen name was not based off this game. It never was or is. My recent interests in cars and all that further makes my screen name fitting, but that wasn't the original intent.Grid 2 is decent. It starts off strong. Amazing intro, right into action, with orchestrated and epic soundtrack pulsing as you pound the track in an old Mustang. Your handler can say your first name, out loud, from a list of common names. He says cool things while you're cornering... Heads up on collisions, or remembers that you need to work on sector 3 of the track. The damage effects are bland but get the job done. The graphics are fantastic. The style of the game is awesome. But it gets entirely bland about as fast as the races become.Grid doesn't know what it wants to be. You get Drift events, Japanese Domestics everyone loves like the Silvia and Fairlady Z.... You get some muscle... You get a slathering of European, German... And then suddenly, karts. Boring ♥♥♥♥ing Formula style cars. I hate the British love of motorsports with a passion. It has no soul. It has 0 anything interesting. It's boring and lame. And little Caterhams are ugly, and boring. Sadly, Grid 2 loves the British take on motorsports... And quickly the awesome Chicago, Miami and Curvey Japanese tracks give way to ugly, bland boring night time race-maps... They offer you a Jaguar, the almighty SLS AMG of course, the most boring and ugly Mclaren, and most European only vehicles by the time you're in Tier 3... But good luck winning any races if you do not pick the stupid karts to race alongside them. That is a gigantic slap in the face. I like racing to be a test of REAL road cars and what a man or woman can do within a realistic, mostly every-day type vehicle. Track-only specific cars are ugly, boring, and honestly in my opinion an extremely lame lifestyle to pursue if that is your interest. And that's the issue. Grid 2 can't decide whether it wants you in the grounded, fun street race-style cars or in full on boring F1 style races. And in the middle it forces you to put both on the table at the same time, much to frustration and misery as one of the obnoxious AI is 6 seconds ahead of you in his little lame kart because you wanted to break the back-end out on the Jaguar. +Starts off strong+Fun handling and racing in the first 2 tiers+Great graphics+Epic soundtrack+A great overall presentation-Turns into F1 style kart racing quickly-Puts Caterham track karts agains full sedans in Tier 3, creating a gigantic rift-Forces you to drive karts to win-Tiniest selection of vehicles, a smattering of some greats, with little to no character-Lush lighting and car visuals give way to the ugliest track renders I've ever seen outside of the Japanese, Chicago and Miami tracks...-Can't decide whether you should drift, or keep it tight, the handling model in the game appears to give up and surprises you on every corner.In terms of the whole package i'd say the game is a solid 6/10. Great graphics, great racing. The ""car culture"" style is nowhere to be found... Sterile and as dull as a doctors office... The game swerves from a great showing to Formula 1 style quick, sapping the fun and life out of the genre while beating laptimes over your head. Blech. "

												From the people who package you understeer and oversteer, we present you all supercars in Grid 2. Nevertheless I'd reccomend this game IF it is on sale. For the $10 I spent on it I think it was completely worth the money, however I cannot see myself forking over $30 for it. The game is very well put together, I especially like that you actually have to use the brakes unlike in Forza Horizon, however it loses some points from me on the car selection. There are some cars I really would have liked to see in this game that I have not seen yet, such as the Audi R8 and the Lamborghini Gallardo. That being said I did not finish the main game yet, I just started the final season. Another small hit the game will take from me is the test drive because there is only one track you can drive on, it is not a major issue but I would have liked to have seen one or two more tracks. The last thing negative about the game is not the makers fault. The online community seems to be dead, everytime I try to play an online race I wait for a while before the game tells me it could not find any online races. Despite the few drawbacks the game is very fun and recommended.			"

Arcade style is ok. I have bought this game, because many people are like: IIts not realistic, its arcade, its to easy.. I dont know, what is hard for them, but this? With evry small hit, it is like ping-pong ball bouncing all over the screen. Car is sliding on almost every turn. Not playeble. C) Buggy. There is function to turn back time when you crash. Nice idea. Why not. But. It sometime does wotk, some time does not. D) Settings. Not enough settings. Like - how strong are arrow key press when turning.			"

												GRID 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.85/100			"

Steams ""opposite of the customer is always right"" no-return policy should come with a ""publishers need to be responsive to bug reports"" policy. Codemasters most recent update on the thread is September.Let the buyer beware.

												I found this purchase to be a difficult one as a lot of people bad mouth the game for not being a sim or for not having a cockpit view, Then procede to unfairly dismiss the rest of the game due to their inability to do some research before they purchase a game.I have found the game to be great fun so far, the presentation is a little over the top, but that is something codemasters have been doing since DIRT 3.The cars handle well, with a good feel of weight vs. power,  powersliding is a lot of fun, the AI is a little plain but it fills it's roll well.Engine sounds are fantastic, ambient noise is somewhat lacking, but the squeal of steel on steel as you trade paint with competitors is good and tire screech is well done. The graphics are fantastic and optimised well, with some great smoke effects from tires as you push your car through corners, some of the best reflections on cars I have seen.After reading all the mixed reviews, I waited for a sale on steam and it was definatly worth the $11 on sale, I would have paid the $30 they ask when it's not on sale, if not for so many negative reviews from disgruntled sim fan boys.If you like car games at all, I recommend you add this to your game list.I would give this an 89 out of 100. GREAT FUN.			"

												Tried online mode first. You can create an account and start customizing a car. There are no opponents, you can't race against anyone. No sessions to join, creating a session leaves you sitting by yourself in the lobby.On to career mode:Handling/controls are terrible. ""Drifting"" often results in the car flinging out of control, even at low speeds.My second career race: Shortly after starting the second lap (of 4) I passed an opponent and then in a turn my right front tire exploded. Due to the horrid camera controls (or lack thereof) I could not see the extent of the damage, only being notified by the lack of being able to turn left and the sparks flying off the ground. When the race ended it turned out that my entire wheel was gone, not just the rubber. When I started the final lap (now in second place) the announcer or whatever finally told me about the missing tire.Finished in second.Third career race: things are going well, we're 3 laps in and I've managed to just pass a vehicle into second place. About 10 seconds later I go to take a turn, only to be rammed by the guy I passed. His car stopped about where the impact occurred and he quickly drove away with minor damage. My car spun around fully and stopped in reverse. Got turned around and get rammed again, this time my car went flying into a wall and stopped abruptly. The car that hit me had no ill effects and just kept driving. Now I'm in 7th place. Get going again and I lose control of the vehicle. Slam into wall and car explodes.Done with this game			"

												This game is just sensational. OK so its an arcade racer, not a simulation, but if that is what you want then there is great fun to be had. The cars and scenery looks superb, the sound is top notch and the crashes and car damage are great. The split screen racing is fast and smooth. Only issue is the time wading through menus and loading screen.			"

												A really good game with a variety of races so that you never see too much of the same. I got the enjoyment of racing in modes i had never even heard of. If you dont mind an arcade style racer, this is your game for sure. One of the best arcade racers, i have ever played in my opinion.			"

General GameplayGRID 2 is the sequel to the BAFTA-award winning, multi-million selling Race Driver: GRID.What disappoints overall is the single-player experience, lots of content was removed and changed.The Multi-Player experience is still alive unlike the first game (servers were closed), but it's full with kids and cheaters, it's only enjoyable with a group of mature friends.As an arcade car game it's awesome, as a Race Driver: GRID sequel it's disappointing, if you want a Race Driver: GRID experience look at Grid: Autosport instead.The DLCs make it a minus too, considering some cars are locked under a paywall both in Single-Player and Multi-Player!Gameplay Rating: 2/5EngineEGO 3.0Graphics OptionsHas the same set of options has the first game, it's on par with all other games in the market!Graphics QualityThe engine suffered a huge improvement, specially in lightning! The colours feel more natural and the textures have higher quality too (Compared to Race Driver: GRID)!PerformanceA low-end PC can run this game at 60FPS without problems, some tweaking may be involved depending on the hardware!Engine Rating: 5/5Overall Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs). If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below! "

												Game was unplayable due to constant stuttering, even after setting graphics to all low and getting 150+ fps. Was able to fix the issue by deleting replay30.pbf and replay60.pbf and replacing them with blank read-only text files. Before that nothing helped, not even a clean OS install. After that the game worked fine, but I can't give a positive review to a game that does something like that, and caused a huge amount of frustration before I managed to fix it. Pretty sad that the developers are not capable of fixing that.			"

												Driving model is just bad. The faster you drive the more you drift - 4WD car at low RPM drifts like crazy, which is just ridiculous. Biggest sin of this game.Single player - annoying. AI cars are made out of concrete. You hit them - you lose. They hit you - you lose. Medium difficulty - way to easy. Hard difficulty - AI cheats, sticky enemies and so on. Multiplayer - dead or dying.Heard that this game used to be popular in MP, but today you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SP and dead MP, so you better get GRID 1 which has excellent SP or newer GRID Autosport.			"

There's literally no control, you can't maintain a drift. There's no option for changing assists, so you're basically forced to drift with traction control and active stability management and other stuff. -1/10.			"

												OK so firstly - This game is actually rather good.Its got a smaller scale HUD and less functionality from the 1st game but the content surely is not lacking.The WSR Career is very good. I ended up using like 5 of my 500 cars so you will find your favourite car(s).Most car specs can be used in any race. Take a Drift into Togue? Why Not?Grip into drift - Good luck winning.Overall the AI is not very stupid adn the Flashback system also corrects any AI mistakes. 5 idiot pile up in france, just flashback and nobody piles up.I suppose if you bought Grid 1 or Autosport and fancy this game - Its similar to Autosport and 1 but it is also a far cry from both.

												Don't get me wrong. The game is addictive and if you buy it, you will probably spend a lot of time with it. But there will also be a lot of anger and frustration. I won't mention multiplayer -- find complaints of hacked game servers elsewhere. I consider the Career mode the core part of the game. You haven't played a game untill you have finished the career, right? Now what I hate the most is that the game does not just offer a variety of cars. It forces them on you. You find yourself constantly switching from supercars to musclecars to hypercars to kitcars. No way to get used to anything. Also, don't think you'll get fair competition. There's no way to qualify in front. You always start from somewhere towards the back, where AI drivers are more than willing to bump you out of the track and into the railings every time you get near. There's no protection once they get close. Can you repay them in kind? No. They stick like tanks.Outside the track there's also little to look at. You will win dozens of cars in your career but is there a way do look at them? You can apply intricate colour patterns but there's no way to walk around watch. There's no upgrading until the end of the career. It's all a shame.If you want to race, buy a real racing game!			"

												I love Grid 2, even more since they rolled out the Demolition Derby mode. But be warned, the game does not like the newest video card drivers from Invidia. If you aren't planning on getting the latest Star Wars game, don't download it. The latest driver is making Grid stutter and freeze, and I'm running dual GTX 960's. Hope they come out with a patch or update, because I can't play Grid 2 anymore.			"

												This game is not all about racing, sadly. It's also about gaining fans in fake social networks within the game. As you win more and more races, you gain more fans.I find that this whole ""let's get our popularity up"" game gets in the way of the racing game. You even get videos about how many fans you gained post-race... after each and every single race. The sponsor deals are all about gaining fans, too.The game makes a nice attempt at immersion by giving you a garage. In said garage you can go browse your in-game computer to see which races to go on next, you can paint your rides and stuff. All of this browsing is done through the most uncomfortable menus ever, since they were made for consoles. So yeah, no mouse pointer, no way of picking the last choice without browsing through them all and so on.GRID 2 also forces you to wait through shiny animations in the menus and in between actions. For example if I know I'm looking for the third option in a menu, I can't click the down arrow three times for it to be selected until it has finished popping up said menu. I feel tied of hands.But to top it off, this game is a DLC fest. You choose a car category and half the cars are locked out because they're DLC cars. That's the most horrible thing they could have done.The racing itself is flawfree though. It's up to you if you wanna endure the popularity contest stuff and the clunky menus and all the crap for the sake of it.			"

												Racing in GRID 2 is very fun with a great sensation of speed and control.  The customization of cars is much greater than GRID and GRID AS. This game feels much more aracade-like even than the first GRID, if you like games like Forza 4 more than games like Need for Speed Underground & Hot Pursuit then you should avoid this game and buy GRID AS instead.  The career is much better than GRID and not tedious like GRID AS.there are a few bad points:- no cockpit cam- CANNOT TURN OFF TRACTION CONTROL OR STABILITY CONTROL- as a result, drifting is terrible and I would hesitate to even call it drifting, more like powersliding.Overall a really fun arcade racer.

												Grid 2 is an arcade racing game developed and published by Codemasters and is a sequel to the populair Race Driver: Grid game.In Grid 2 you race in real world locations and cities such as Miami, Chicago, Paris, Barcelona, Côte d'Azur, Dubai, Japan and many more.In the singleplayer mode it's all about the World Series Racing (WSR) and you must work your way up by beating racing clans and prestige drivers in career club events, receiving fans and earn faster cars varying from Tier 1 to 4.There are many racetypes such as Time Attack, Elimination, Drift, Checkpoint, Faceoff, Destruction Derby (free dlc) and Race of course.The multiplayer mode behaves almost the same except that you do not earn fans but money per race in order to buy and upgrade your cars. Besides Online Events there are also game modes such as Global Challenge and Rivals for more entertainment.The DLC content packs for GRID2 are also great, giving you more cars and some of them have extra racetracks to challenge your competitors.Grid 2 is one of my first race games where I feel very comfortable to go online with. Every car feels different and the racetracks are very memorable for me. Although Codemaster left the well known cockpit view from the first game, Grid 2 is still very enjoying and true must have for people who love arcade racing!			"

												Ok, so I'm not a huge racing game fan. I've never really been into need4speed, gran turismo, project gotham and so on. This probably has a lot to do with a friend who would take great pleasure in showing no mercy to noobs to racing games he'd been playing for months. Getting repeatedly lapped sucked the joy out of most of these games for me. Then I discovered Forza 2, a game that had somehow gone under his radar. And having not lost the will to live whilst playing it I actually got ok at it and played it upto the point when the endurance races begun. Then my friend discovered it and finally here was a racing game that I could beat him at. So the Forza franchise will forever hold a special place in my affections. But sadly Microsoft have not ported any version of Forza to the PC, which sucks.Step up Grid 2. Grid 2 has a feel of Forza about it. It looks beautiful, with graphics that are comparable to Forza 5. It boasts game play that can be exhillerating and infuriating during the same race. It also includes Brands Hatch and two F1 tracks in Yas Marina in the UAE and the Red Bull Ring in Austria. In short I have been looking for a racing game that I can find as enjoyable as I used to Forza. And although Grid 2 lacks the depth of Forza, I have found it every bit as enjoyable in the few short hours that I have played it, and for me there can be no higher praise for a racing game than that.8/10 (would be 9/10 if it was Forza)			"

												Absolutely wonderful. I'm not even done the game, but having played with cars in Tier 3, I can safely say that this game is an absolute blast especially with friends.+Fantastic graphics.+Well optimized. (I have it maxed out at 45-55fps without much fluctuation, so it's smooth!)+Lacking rubberband AI. They're just fast and don't really make mistakes.+No more need for a useless teammate!+Nice, arcade style racing. Oversteering never felt so satisfying.+Soundtrack is pretty bumpin'.+Your steering doesn't lock up at high speeds like some OTHER ""racing games"".+/-A big change from the more simulation oriented GRID 1+/-Lots of DLC cars.+/- Not too many tracks. Enough to be satisfying, and allow racers to learn the tracks.+/-Crashes are sometimes fun to watch when you screw up.-The difficulty can be a pain. Again, the AI makes virtually no mistakes.-AI cars are heavy, making it damn near impossible to wreck them for personal gain.			"

												Want a Simulator racing but with a little arcade? Here's your answer. Unless you're a full sim fan, go Grid 1, Assetto Corsa etc. Grid 2 is more towards arcade racing just so you know. Modifying and customizing cars? Just paints, a little bit of vinyl and rims. Nothing like engine etc in campaign. Go online for more fun. Online is basically what we want.			"

												I really, really like this game. But, what did I expect? It's codemasters so it has to be good.If you really want to get serious invest in a racing wheel. This game is nearly unplayable without a wheel or gamepad. Overall, really good game, easy on your system and is really fun.			"

												Absolutely wonderful. I'm not even done the game, but having played with cars in Tier 3, I can safely say that this game is an absolute blast especially with friends.+Fantastic graphics.+Well optimized. (I have it maxed out at 45-55fps without much fluctuation, so it's smooth!)+Lacking rubberband AI. They're just fast and don't really make mistakes.+No more need for a useless teammate!+Nice, arcade style racing. Oversteering never felt so satisfying.+Soundtrack is pretty bumpin'.+Your steering doesn't lock up at high speeds like some OTHER ""racing games"".+/-A big change from the more simulation oriented GRID 1+/-Lots of DLC cars.+/- Not too many tracks. Enough to be satisfying, and allow racers to learn the tracks.+/-Crashes are sometimes fun to watch when you screw up.-The difficulty can be a pain. Again, the AI makes virtually no mistakes.-AI cars are heavy, making it damn near impossible to wreck them for personal gain.			"

												GRID 2 is a great racing game. It has almost anything a racing fan would love in a game.The gameplay is like a normal racing. You go, you brake, you turn. It certainly doesn't get old as I feel like I must keep playing this game for at least 10 hours (I won't though). Very fast paced and the drifts are so satifing.The game looks great also. Every car looks great and you can customize your car to your liking. Any damage done to your car is clearly seen and it can make you sad when it tears your car up.Sound is nice with the sound of engines and pieces of metal when crashing. Soundtrack is good and sets the mode for a fast paced racing game.Would not be a bad buy at full price. (Get it for a good deal right now on Humble Bundle[www.humblebundle.com]. Ends about 2PM December 8th)			"

												Although this is a game that bases on legal racing, it doesn't have the typical steering guidance system that most games of this type within the genre are expected to have. Instead, it has a raw but smooth steering system that is pleasing to use, even with a keyboard. There is no economy (on carreer mode), but still has a big capability for car customization. And the variety of vehicles and gamemodes that can be unlocked are simply astonishing, giving the player an actual ""personality"" in-game, as he or she will pick the type of vehicle that pleases them the most and the events that they are best at. Also, the graphics, physics and AI give the game a very refined and smooth look, while providing a pleasing challenge to the average racing gamer.9/10			"

												The career mode is good fun once you get a hand of the rather odd handling of the cars. I found using an X-Box style controller felt better and made it a little easier to control the wild steering.Online is slow going at first, have to level all the way to 27 (out of 99) to unlock all the standard cars, which in all honesty is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You can pay to unlock them all early.The free Demolition Derby DLC is fun, lots of other DLC including cars and tracks (or mixtures of both). I nearly always manage to join a group of 9-12 players for online races which is fun, although the mix of skill levels often seems unfair, with level 99s flying past level 8s or whatever.A few annoying control features - no PTT for voice, no global mute for voice. No text chat, which would be a handy extra feature for the lobby. Menus feel a bit slow and often like there are too many button presses to get around.All in, I've enjoyed the game so far (compelted career) and I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												Ok, so I'm not a huge racing game fan. I've never really been into need4speed, gran turismo, project gotham and so on. This probably has a lot to do with a friend who would take great pleasure in showing no mercy to noobs to racing games he'd been playing for months. Getting repeatedly lapped sucked the joy out of most of these games for me. Then I discovered Forza 2, a game that had somehow gone under his radar. And having not lost the will to live whilst playing it I actually got ok at it and played it upto the point when the endurance races begun. Then my friend discovered it and finally here was a racing game that I could beat him at. So the Forza franchise will forever hold a special place in my affections. But sadly Microsoft have not ported any version of Forza to the PC, which sucks.Step up Grid 2. Grid 2 has a feel of Forza about it. It looks beautiful, with graphics that are comparable to Forza 5. It boasts game play that can be exhillerating and infuriating during the same race. It also includes Brands Hatch and two F1 tracks in Yas Marina in the UAE and the Red Bull Ring in Austria. In short I have been looking for a racing game that I can find as enjoyable as I used to Forza. And although Grid 2 lacks the depth of Forza, I have found it every bit as enjoyable in the few short hours that I have played it, and for me there can be no higher praise for a racing game than that.8/10 (would be 9/10 if it was Forza)			"

One thing I do not like is that the DLC's are quite expensive. Yet I do feel as if you're getting your money's worth. I'll admit some of them do cost a lot though. I'd recommend only buying track packs, and maybe a car pack here and there. The tracks that I have are Spa and Bathurst and they are fun road courses. I'm pretty sure the IndyCar Pack has a NASCAR-esque loop track so that may be worth checking out. I have also heard that the Multiplayer isn't very active anymore which is a downer. But in conclusion, this game is so much fun, looks great, plays great, CodeMasters optimizes there games very well. Buy it! Rating: 10/10			"

												Do you want an honest advice from somebody who knows what he is talking about? The advice is the best you can find and it is very effective! If you are running Windows 10, with the latest updates and a high end graphics card as the nVidia 980, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It will mess up your computer so bad, if you don't know about computers, you may have to bring your computer to a computer service center and it may stay there for weeks before you get it back. The reason why it is cheap is, it does not run on latest hardware and operating systems properly, and they still want to sell this thing to you anyway to make the last bit of profit. They don't care if it will work or not on your latest PC. Your PC will crash, and if you have read this feedback and if you still buy this game, the crash will only be your responsibility. Don't be fooled when you see this game under the list of compatible games with Windows 10, of course it will be there.The game play is over-rated also. To make things look hard, the controls were made non-linear, meaning that there is no ratio between your input and how the dynamics of the car behaves. This only means that it will be difficult to master this game, in other words, you will not have fun playing the game, you will suffer trying to learn what they are trying to teach you how to play.

												I managed to complete the game pretty quickly. I liked the progression system that didn't require any money and all the cars were done beautifully. I didn't particularly like the drifiting system compared to the first GRID and drift type cars were a bit difficult to control, however the steering in general was pretty good for a keyboard. Tracks weren't too hard except for one on one races through mountain roads and vehicle challenges on the same roads.. Those were frustraiting at times.			"

												This game is not all about racing, sadly. It's also about gaining fans in fake social networks within the game. As you win more and more races, you gain more fans.I find that this whole ""let's get our popularity up"" game gets in the way of the racing game. You even get videos about how many fans you gained post-race... after each and every single race. The sponsor deals are all about gaining fans, too.The game makes a nice attempt at immersion by giving you a garage. In said garage you can go browse your in-game computer to see which races to go on next, you can paint your rides and stuff. All of this browsing is done through the most uncomfortable menus ever, since they were made for consoles. So yeah, no mouse pointer, no way of picking the last choice without browsing through them all and so on.GRID 2 also forces you to wait through shiny animations in the menus and in between actions. For example if I know I'm looking for the third option in a menu, I can't click the down arrow three times for it to be selected until it has finished popping up said menu. I feel tied of hands.But to top it off, this game is a DLC fest. You choose a car category and half the cars are locked out because they're DLC cars. That's the most horrible thing they could have done.The racing itself is flawfree though. It's up to you if you wanna endure the popularity contest stuff and the clunky menus and all the crap for the sake of it.			"

												Good game, great graphics with not too high specs required. Sounds is pretty good but seemed roary in cars. It uses a drift to turn mechanics but still has to slow down for corners. I only play in multiplayers as you can upgrade the cars. The single player pretty much like a basic unlocking game with some achievements, specials here and there. Get it on discount like me. Buy DLC only when you play a lot online multiplayer, and beware of carnages in multiplayer.			"

												First I'd like to say that you dont need to use the brake in this game at all (look at the achievement, if you dont believe me)Second this is  an arcade racer where the other (AI) racers main job is to bash you around the track, feels like theyre driving solid granite cars compared to your cardboard crumple zone.  This is a step backwards compared to Grid and to add to that someone screwed up the controls, why do we need two handbrake buttons?  The normal brake button feels as if all the brake bias is set to the rear, it instantly sends you into a drift as soon as you touch the left or right button at the same time.Also unlike Grid you cannot fine tune your controller deadzones or sensitivity.  Good thing I bought this at 75% off otherwise I would have been peeved.			"

												First off I have played Grid 1 on my Playstation 3 and really enjoyed it and i would highly recommend you get that game instead of this one.This game has beutiful graphics and a remarcable attention to deatail appart from the lack of  an inside view which in my opinion that may put some people off. Visuals asisde the gameplay has ""updated"" the drifting but i feel they have over done it for me it was a steap learning cuvre that took me ages to figure out this also makes the game feel more of an arcade game rather than a sim. Personally the only high point of this game were the graphics i also hope that they sort out this drifting feature for the next one (if there is going to be one) i give this game a 6/10pros .nice graphics.plenty of cars.interesting game modes cons.shoddy drifting mechanic.very repetitive			"

												Você está acostumado a jogar alguns jogos de corrida onde os oponentes praticamente entregam suas posições para você e isto lhe parece muito chato ? Tente jogar GRID e não passar raiva por não conseguir nem ultrapassar o oponente mais próximo de você. Certeza que muito reinicios de fase serão necessários que até que consiga pegar as ""manhas"" da corrida e do trajeto. Sem falar em um companheiro chato que fica o tempo todo falando frases que eram para te motivar mas que acabam te deixando com mais raiva ainda. Se eu recomendo ? Claro, mas não como um jogo para aliviar a raiva e sim para te fazer passar raiva.			"

												First I'd like to say that you dont need to use the brake in this game at all (look at the achievement, if you dont believe me)Second this is  an arcade racer where the other (AI) racers main job is to bash you around the track, feels like theyre driving solid granite cars compared to your cardboard crumple zone.  This is a step backwards compared to Grid and to add to that someone screwed up the controls, why do we need two handbrake buttons?  The normal brake button feels as if all the brake bias is set to the rear, it instantly sends you into a drift as soon as you touch the left or right button at the same time.Also unlike Grid you cannot fine tune your controller deadzones or sensitivity.  Good thing I bought this at 75% off otherwise I would have been peeved.			"

												Você está acostumado a jogar alguns jogos de corrida onde os oponentes praticamente entregam suas posições para você e isto lhe parece muito chato ? Tente jogar GRID e não passar raiva por não conseguir nem ultrapassar o oponente mais próximo de você. Certeza que muito reinicios de fase serão necessários que até que consiga pegar as ""manhas"" da corrida e do trajeto. Sem falar em um companheiro chato que fica o tempo todo falando frases que eram para te motivar mas que acabam te deixando com mais raiva ainda. Se eu recomendo ? Claro, mas não como um jogo para aliviar a raiva e sim para te fazer passar raiva.			"

												This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is still more about drifting than about racing. Things go like this: full throttle - violent brake - throw your car into a very convoluted corner sliding on all four wheels, then again flat out and so on. There is no cockpit view, there are no real tracks, no car setup and tunning. They could not be bothered with such stuff. Probably because they were to busy making DLC cars and tracks because half of the cars in the game you bought need to be purchased. Yep. TOTAL rip off, avoid like plague untill they drop the price to 10 bucks. Multiplayer is deserted most of the time, and when you do find a game, you cannot join because you need to buy some DLC car or track. I got mine with a CPU but I really feel sorry for those guys who payed 40 bucks for this game. "

												A brilliant follow-up to GRID. If you are looking for an exciting fast-paced arcade racer, then you'll not get better than this. With stunning visuals and a well formed storyline, yeah, you read right, storyline; GRID 2 delivers on all levels. Right from the get-go the Tier1 cars are all pretty solid and fun to drive and the races are varied and interesting. Progression through the tiers as you slowly ramp up the World Series Racing is engaging and fun. With some top cars, exciting moments and great battles, you'll remember the races for a while. Especially as you can record them and upload to YouTube from right in the game...and that's just the single player! Not even taking into account RaceNet and the world of online competition and rivalries you can setup along with global challenge races, I'm hopeful that it will continue to deliver for quite some time.A beautiful, fun and exciting arcade racer. A solid 9.5/10 from me			"

												First off I have played Grid 1 on my Playstation 3 and really enjoyed it and i would highly recommend you get that game instead of this one.This game has beutiful graphics and a remarcable attention to deatail appart from the lack of  an inside view which in my opinion that may put some people off. Visuals asisde the gameplay has ""updated"" the drifting but i feel they have over done it for me it was a steap learning cuvre that took me ages to figure out this also makes the game feel more of an arcade game rather than a sim. Personally the only high point of this game were the graphics i also hope that they sort out this drifting feature for the next one (if there is going to be one) i give this game a 6/10pros .nice graphics.plenty of cars.interesting game modes cons.shoddy drifting mechanic.very repetitive			"

												Dear AmericaYou produced some very attractive looking vehicles in the form of the Ford Mustang, Dodge Charger and Chevy Camero. However, these vehicles are deeply, deeply awful racing cars. Even the game itself seems to accept this as they handle like the dogs they are. Therefore, why do you insist we have to drive these lumps of pig iron when it is obvious that your European and Japanese allies make much better vehicles? We have McDonalds, Pizza Hut and KFC. Why can you not simply accept that we make better cars and that it is really dumb to make us have to drive these blocks of lard.Thank youLoveEuropeps. nice game			"

												It's a pretty game. But there are a lot of issues for me personally. One of them is the AI - they are, quite literally, on rails. If you perform a PIT maneuver on an AI driver nothing happens, they continue straight on their predetermined line, and you slow down. Another thing that really bugged me were the penalties for cutting corners, sure you could argue I should 'get good' but for me a lot of fun in racing comes from exploiting the grass to my advantage. It's impossible to disable the penalties, even in single player. Having purchased a Driving force GT racing wheel I was disappointed to find out that the game is unplayable with it. I had huge difficuties controlling anything - where as DiRT 3 works very well. The best way to play this is with a controller.I did enjoy the first few hours a lot though, but in the end I gave up in frustration.			"

												Although Grid 2 is a great game on it's own, it does not make up for it's issues and faults (especially the PC version). Not to mention I went through so many problems with the game black screening, and the game constantly crashing (Pretty much gave up at this point). Although I did have it working at one point or another, probably to do with the fact I was using AMD prior to switching back to Nvidia and it was working flawlessly, but since doing some research I've seen people also have the same issues with AMD rigs, including their CPU. I know there's many solutions to these issues, but I really don't feel as if spending the time trying to fix the issues will encourage me to play it as much as the GRID before the 2nd installment.If you're into the GRID series then I'd easily recommend this game, but with the amount of effort required to get this game working without any hiccups is ridiculous.

												Although Grid 2 is a great game on it's own, it does not make up for it's issues and faults (especially the PC version). Not to mention I went through so many problems with the game black screening, and the game constantly crashing (Pretty much gave up at this point). Although I did have it working at one point or another, probably to do with the fact I was using AMD prior to switching back to Nvidia and it was working flawlessly, but since doing some research I've seen people also have the same issues with AMD rigs, including their CPU. I know there's many solutions to these issues, but I really don't feel as if spending the time trying to fix the issues will encourage me to play it as much as the GRID before the 2nd installment.If you're into the GRID series then I'd easily recommend this game, but with the amount of effort required to get this game working without any hiccups is ridiculous.

To the point that I tried to hack configuration files to disable this nextg... I mean chromatic aberration. No luck. I wear glasses, so I already got enough CA in my life. Really regret I bought /this/. First GRID was a decent game. This one is the last GRID, DIRT whatever racing crap I ever buy from these devs.			"

												It's a racing game that in career mode there is no way to get to the pole position. As such, the game encourages you to get to the front of the pack, not by driving well, but by using the flashback button to destroy the leader as many time as possible. I picked it up for 6.00, and to be honest, it's worth sub 5.00 due to the lack of in game dash display mode and the lack of any possible way to move to the front of the pack while driving well.			"

												The physics in this game must have come from another planet because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. Your car  feels like it's made out of paper and opponents charge through you like there's nothing in their way. The cars, especially drift cars like honda nsx, are completely uncontrollable over 200 kmh. You could say that this is realistic but the problem is that your opponents don't seem to have this problem. Even at slow speeds it feels like you are driving on ice and you find yourself struggling to drive in a straight line. Extremely frustrating			"

												Grid 2 is very similar to the original grid, but maintains all the problems with the first one and adds quite a few new ones.Biggest overall issue, car handling. Its very difficult and frustrating to play any driving game where the handling is poor, and this game has some of the worst. Every car snaps loose multiple times every race. Not just breaking a bit loose and having to oversteer to correct, but snapping loose, losing control constantly. Even the front wheel drive cars are constntly oversteering. Many of the cars go from massive understeer to wild oversteer in a second. If you make contact with an AI driver, you will spin. If an AI driver makes contact with you, you will spin. The driving feels unrealistic, unpleasant, and unfair.Other issues are: Money system replaced with ""youtube fans"". No decision making for car unlocks, you just get it all at a slow pace. Single player story is on a rail and feels like you have no choice over tracks or direction of play. Endurance races are abysmal, short in duration, no map and random turns makes for frustrating gameplay.Positives: This game is very pretty "

												Fun game pretty good deal for $12.49 couldn't pass this Racing genre.  Great Graphics, gameplay, cars, but I still miss GRID 1's original cockpit view as to the 2nd version lacking it :(  Just a way of lazyness on the developers part.  They took it out using a 1% users use cockpit view shouldn't matter it's a racing game all racing games should have this view no questions asked.Multiplayer is a blast especially bringing back Destruction Derby.  Single player would be ok if they didn't make the opponents over powering like when you want to make them wreck they have way too much power over you from making it possible you either have to go 100mph to side swipe them to even get into any collision, other than that good luck trying at any other speed, please make this an option or fix, thank you.  Other than that the game is worth the money especially the sale we had.			"

												Grid 2 is a gorgeous, well-designed game that packs a tonne of variety into both single-player and multiplayer. Hardcore sim fans and those who refuse to play anything that doesn’t feature a cockpit may well disapprove, but Grid 2‘s realistic-but-not-too-realistic driving and drifting should be able to pull a squeak of delight out of just about anyone else.

												Slightly older game, but it still manages to holds its own against newer titles. Controls feel good without being *too* silly and arcade-y. Good selection of cars with fairly distinct characteristics to choose from. Pretty nice selection of tracks — the downhill mountain track in Japan is a personal favourite. Excellent casual online racing fun against your friends, especially if you have a good range of cars unlocked. I just wish we could change that stupid 20 second countdown before each race, as I prefer a bit more time to think about my vehicle choice.			"

												Transformed game compared to Grid (1). This is better in every way possible, I could not ne bothered to play the original but in this the UI feels modern. The cars drive well, you can feel/understand the weight transfer even using a game pad. This makes it fun to play. This is worth getting if on special.UPDATE: As you get further in you are forced to play bumper cars at the start of races to force your way through the pack quickly enough to have a chance to win races. The later levels also have a wild spread of difficulty that ranges from simple to insane and not much between. The hard levels are caused by stupid looooooog tracks with no run off and the need to use cars that handle really badly but really fast. Because of this I lost interest, shame as great fun until that pontUPDATE: Do not buy any of the DLC, it mostly appears to be based around online which is dead			"

												GRID 2 suffers from severe issues in the user interface. It forces you to race a match before it will let you do anything else, such as pick your player name. And the list of names available are all MALE, names like Randy, Jeff, Muhammed and even Jesus... but not a single female name to pick from! Way to alienate half of the population, Codemasters.In one race I got spun around, and amidst the confusion and smoke I didn't realise I was facing the wrong way. The game didn't tell me that I was going the wrong way, but it did abruptly disqualify me.It also seems to lock most of the cars away from you, until you've levelled up. If you want to play a Level 1 multiplayer game with anything but an Alfa Romeo, you're sweet outta luck. Try again in about a dozen or so races.It boggles my mind that a game that feels so fun to play is being choked to death by bad designers.			"

												 OK so, after probably 5.6 hours of literally sitting around in the menus, and tabbing out the game to find a solution to the game crashing every 3 minutes, i found a solution that works for me. If you want to know it, ask me below, because i dont feel it is the right place to do it in the review. I really do feel like the dev's of this game (Codemasters) are ignorant by not fixing this problem as it seems to be persistent through many computers. Moving on, back to the review, i DO NOT recommend it, it is utterly useless. I did not buy the game, it came with the PC i bought and i thought i would try it out. But dont think about buying it. The game is not realistic at all in my opinion, unless you think that theres lubricant on the road 100% of the time. Using a Logitech G27 it is impossible to drive, going around a little corner and it slips, even without accelerating on it. On the other side of the game, the graphics are beautiful, very realistic looking. Not to mention the cheesy loading screens though, my eyes hurt after restarting the game a couple of times.			"

A pretty good game to play in my past time, commentary is great aswell!Yes, the graphics COULD be improved but it runs very well, even on my i3 potato laptop.I would recommend this game to people who love their racing games and don't expect drifting and traction to be easy!

The campaign isn't as long as in the 1st game but the multiplayer portion is alot better with more game modes, things to unlock and cars to buy. 9/10			"

												Could've been a good racing game but sadly it's being let down by pretty much all of it's parts. I can accept arcadey physics and handling as long as car behaviour is at least somewhat plausible. In this game however seems to be made with the sole purpose of looking cool from the outside. If you have the slight interest in driving and racing just stay away from this one. It's about style, not much else. Also every single design choice seems to be made to make the experience as annoying as possible.			"

Second, Grid is a great game if your hand eye coordination is lacking and you dont like cars driving like they do in the real world. Three, Grid is a great game if you hate customization of any sort, i mean absolutley loathe it. Finally Grid 2 is the best racing game in the genre of ""Racing sequels to games that start with the letter G and end with D and whos middle letters ryhme with Pi"" GOOD JOB CODEMASTERS!!

If you want a great singleplayer racing game then this is one of the best choices i know currently. There is multiplayer but nobody plays multiplayer anymore because this is a old game.

												Could've been a good racing game but sadly it's being let down by pretty much all of it's parts. I can accept arcadey physics and handling as long as car behaviour is at least somewhat plausible. In this game however seems to be made with the sole purpose of looking cool from the outside. If you have the slight interest in driving and racing just stay away from this one. It's about style, not much else. Also every single design choice seems to be made to make the experience as annoying as possible.			"

												You get a really small variety of cars with the base game. I'd say at most, you get maybe 15? Then theres a ton more in DLC packs. If I didnt buy this game for $1, and was able to get the Grid 2 All in One DLC for like $6, I'd feel really quite ripped off.However, online is fun. All the cars feel different. Driving feels great. Except for the beginning of races with more than 4 people. The beginning is like a ♥♥♥♥ing demoliton derby. If you're in first, steer the hell out of anyones way. If you're in the middle, you're pretty lucky. I cant tell if a lot of the community is trolling or just really terrible at racing. I'll be slowing down at a corner, like most people do, and this idiot rear ends me, makes me spin out, and slams into the wall. Sometimes I'll hear them laughing, other times I can just see that they're really terrible. I'll look behind me and see this guy trying to take turns going way too fast and slamming into a wall or going off track. Either way, trolling or terrible skill, its really annoying getting slammed by them and then your car is just destroyed, and you fall way behind.But after a while you get used to it, and learn to stay the hell away from people, and pickout the trolls/idiots and the people who actually want to race. A con is that theres only upgrading and modding your vehicles on multiplayer. Single player is pretty much you getting a pre setup car, and taking it for racing. I dont get why they went this route instead of letting us having modding on and offline. Eventually, this games online will completely die out. Online is nearly dead. If you play on American servers, for whatever reason its super dead. Switch your download settings to London UK, and you'll find matches much more often.			"

												I am NOT a racing game fan. I find racing games difficult to get into, often counterintuitive to control, and unnecessarily restrictive with cars and tracks.Also, I'm terrible at it.However, I found myself in the mood for a fun racing game after playing GTA V with its many amazing modded cars, and saw GRID 2 on the Lunar New Year sale, so I gave it a try.I'm glad I did.PROS:- GRID 2 doesn't punish hilariously inept racers like me from the get-go. It does a great job of easing you in, and you can start on noob settings, like I did, or try genuinely difficult settings. It's great for all skill levels.- It's FUN! Some racing games feel stressful. GRID 2 doesn't. The game does a good job of capturing the joy of driving.- The controls feel INTUITIVE! You know how the best games almost make you ""feel"" obstacles with your controller, mouse, joystick or steering wheel? The games that make you duck IRL when you're flying below something, or recoil to dodge a projectile or piece of shrapnel? GRID 2 is the racing version of that. The controls feel completely natural from the start, and they are equally precise.- The cities are lovingly rendered. You can race through Barcelona and see the Sagrada Familia looming over the streets; rocket through brightly lit Hong Kong at night; cruise Dubai's ultra-modern tracks; race in the shadow of the Eiffel tower...and on and on. The background art in this game is spectacular. - It's well optimized. Framerate holds up fantastically, and I'm using a GTX 760, not the worst but not the best either. The important thing is, this game runs incredibly smooth, something that's always appreciated in a game where twitch response is important.- The cars are awesome. It's not exclusively supercars, although the game has its share of Paganis and McLarens. There are American muscle cars, drift cars from Nissan and Honda, and high-performance vehicles from makers like BMW, Audi, etc. The paint options are legion, with a shading system to get the exact colors you want, and choices between things like metallic, matte, pearlescant, flip, etc.- The game can be set to speak your real name, and your racing team leader gives you helpful tips when you're on the track or practicing. It's all situational, and so far it hasn't been repetitive at all.CONS:- While you can choose from any track (or so it seems) in custom events, you still have to unlock cars in career mode, unfortunately. - You can change wheels, but it's not clear if they're anything more than aesthetic changes. That's  fine with me, but maybe some people would want more depth.- I'm not Vin Diesel.OVERALL: Would recommend, even for terrible racers like me. Most of all, it's FUN.			"

												Decent game. Playability, very similar to Grid 1. Longevity, depends on whether you want to drop 30 snots for DLC. Plenty of playtime without, though.Reliability - honestly, terrible. Ridiculous bugs that plagued DiRT 3 are still present.Overall - no way do I recommend this game, until such a time as the bugs are ironed out (which won't happen) and the DLC drops in price.Update 5th/October/2014 - to date, still no patch to fix the bugs since I originally reviewed this on 3rd/December/2013. And, of course, no patch in sight, seeing as the same bugs have carried over to it's predecessor. And a tech support team who aren't in any way familiar with it's products. Codemasters.....

												I really hate this new trend where game sequels are now crap compared to their predecessors, where all of the substances and originality of the first game is tossed away in favor of generic, trend tedium that we have seen in a million other games. Buy Grid 1, it's better. On it's own merits, Grid 2 is about average or slightly better than your average racer. Grid 1 is a 3rd the price though and superior in most ways. Aside from being completely linear with no real choice in what races to compete in (and a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of completely bland cars), Grid 2 takes itself way too seriously and sacrifices game modes and gameplay for flashy cutscenes.

They break out in corners and as the driver you constantly feel like you're not in control! This sucks! I can never play this game more than 15 minutes....because the uncontrollable cars drive me crazy! Shame....this could have been an amazing game if it would've been a bit closer to the first part!

												This review does not take into account multiplayer, as I did not play multiplayer.Admittedly, I wasn't much of a fan of GRID 1.  But having seen the new race types via YouTube videos, I picked up GRID 2 and the two track packs for about $16USD.GRID 2 is alright if you're wanting to run some quick, custom races and don't mind drifting around every corner.  But the career mode is little more than a trickle of new race types on the same few tracks shoved between infuriatingly long and unskippable cut scenes.I suppose I got my $16 worth.  I'll probably do some single-player custom races from time to time (in order to see the two additional tracks I bought), but career mode is dead to me.			"

												Grid 2 is a confident, aggressive, good-looking racer that boasts a level of focus last year’s Dirt: Showdown didn’t have. It’s well executed and easily the measure of the award-winning original in all but a couple of areas. However, missteps with how it approaches its track content will harm its long-term appeal, and further shedding of its sim-based roots will continue to alienate fans of the racing games Codemasters made back in the late ’90s and early 2000s.

												This is THE racing game of all time!!!The fun level is off the charts, and it's the kind of racing game that makes you crave the first position at all costs. No matter how many times you have to repeat the track over and over and over until you get the first position. Third will not do. It's the kind of game that will leave you with muscle cramps in your fingers and hand and rist from turning and braking and drifting. it's insane!!! The graphics are a treat for the eyes, and the feel and sound of the car work perfectly. It's a lovely game and I wanna thank the producers from the very core of my gaming heart.

												I didn't play more than 50mins of this game to know how horribly unrealistic it is.When you're like me who has been playing GRID 1 for so many hours, loving the feel of the cars and the looks of the game, and then you jump to GRID 2 thinking ""How in the world could GRID 2 be that much better, because GRID 1 already is the best racing game I've played."" then you sit down and watch as your car hits an invisible wall at 80mphs and all your car does is bounce off of it like a trampoline and have little to no damage, when you expected to fly off the ♥♥♥♥ing cliff and watch your driver and car just get destroyed.Don't waste your money on GRID 2 or GRID Autosport. Just buy GRID 1 and enjoy the beauty of it!			"

												PROS:Nice GraphicsRealismCONS:Be aware, everyone with a 500, 600 and 700 series Nvidia cards have major compatibility issues. The game is unplayable if you have an Nvidia GPU, every  10 minutes your PC's GPU will freeze and you will probably need to reboot the PC. Terrible coding for Nvidia cards from Codemasters. This is a known issue since release and there is not a workable fix, even Nvidia blaims that on the game's coding.All in all a good racing game, but I will not support Codemasters again if they stick to terrible Nvidia GPU porting.

												Do not buy!The first time you start the game you're taken to a tutorial, so to say, which constists of a couple of different, short races. At this point I was already shocked; how can the driving of this game be this horrible? I shook my head and hoped that this was just a tutorial thing; maybe the developers wanted to give a very hand-held driving mode for the tutorial so no one can lose it. But I was wrong, so wrong. I completed the tutorial, and found out that the handling of this game is still horrible. It's even worse than that of GTA V, which, bear in mind, is NOT a driving game at all! It's not worth paying any money for this at all, even if you get this game for free, there's no reason to play it. It has no vehicle upgrading, it has no free driving, and most importantly, it has the worst driving mode I have ever experienced. This game doesn't seem to cater to any player group, hence my listing of lacking features above. What it does have is a career-mode with different tracks and styles: street, race and drift. I can not tell anything more though, as I quit the game after 38 minutes, but apparently there are quite a few of those available. I completed the tutorial, one additional race and of course I had to test drive an Alfa Romeo, but that's it. Enough for me and never again. I hope I can get a refund of this.TL;DR: The handling is the worst of any game I've ever tested.			"

												At first I was really excited about this game. I have not played a racing game in ages. The last one I played was NFS Hot Pursuit.   It started out pretty good. The graphics were great and the interface was pretty decent.   Regarding the offline career, there are different ways you can get through it. Either you have to complete racing missions or you have to complete drifting missions. You get two cars to chose between, and then you are off. The main goal is to win the missions which will increase your fan base (amount of followers / viewers). When you have enough fans, you unlock a big event, which you have to complete. Then, you basically start over. The only difference is the tracks change and the opponents get a little harder. On your way up, you win new cars. There is no feature, where you can tweak and tune them. The cars are how they are, though you can change their appearance.The gameplay is okay. It is not that hard to master the drifting and the racing is pretty easy as well. If you fail, you can always use the rewind button and correct your mistake. Besides that, there are no features worth mentioning. I bought the game to play the career, so all over it was a pretty disappointing experience. I would not recommend anyone to buy this game if they like me expect a good career.			"

												Solid racer, but I prefer the more real world race world of the original grid. I also prefer the cars, tracks and handling of the old game, not to forget the team approach with multiple cars.Codemasters chose not use real world licenses and ended up with a fantasy race league, which is IMHO again a real step back.A city race with dynamically changing routes is not believable, as it would be virtually impossible to change a layout while the race is ongoing as is the case in Grid 2. Not that it isn't fun, but again it detracts from the level of realism that was present in the original Grid.In the end, regardless of some graphical improvements, I just prefer the original over Grid 2 and hope that Codemasters will revert to the same type of game if they ever produce Grid 3.Good game, but I recommend you look at Grid before Grid 2, unless you want to play multiplayer.Codemasters pulled the plug on the old Grid MP, not very nice of them...certainly not a long term selling point.

												I loved the first GRID which melded arcade and simulation racing perfectly.  So I was a little put off by reviews saying GRID2 was a completely different game.  I needn't have worried.  While it’s true GRID2 is more arcade-like than the first it’s none the worse for it.  It looks good, it feels fast and the point to point races are excellent.  I’ve recently got into the online mode and that too is a lot of fun and a decent game in itself (level up, earn money and upgrade cars).  My only criticism is that it doesn’t feel like there are quite enough tracks.  I would have liked more variation (many tracks are just different routes round the same city).  But it’s a solid game and definitely the best arcade racer I’ve played since the original GRID.			"

												All in all, pretty good. I have to admit that the game has been a little glitchy, with my rig crashing an average of once every 45 minutes, but for some reason I keep coming back. Anti-aliasing settings seem to be part of the problem, and once I dialed them in a bit it seems to run a lot better now. There is something about the ambience, the quiet music and the feel of nostalgia. Starting out in your own suburbian garage? A world racing league? It grows on you, fast. The story is not so in-depth that it gets in the way. (I mean you, NFS: Undercover!) Some may say over-simplistic; if you are into being able to control every little setting on your car than this is not for you,  but if you like feeling like you are part of the story, than GRID 2 is...

												I'm not car guy nor a fan of each year's installment of a new racing game, but I got this for free with a processor and decided to download it and give it a try. That being said, I wasn't expecting much nor did I think that I would enjoy this game, seeing as the only racing series I've ever kind of enjoyed is Burnout. After playing a few races, I thought that it looked pretty good, and that it was kind of fun, actually. I enjoyed the rewind feature, which alleviates the frustration for those who prefer to ""just drive"" and are not into the driving optimally for each turn and whatnot. I also really enjoyed the way the career mode works, as it made it seem like you were an up and comer. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and did manage to beat the campaign mode. 8/10 "

												It's fun arcade racing game. Cars are very slidey and you need to drift most of the corners if you want to play optimally. Some people don't like it but I find it very satisfying to pull off series of turns while drifting perfectly.Singleplayer is racing on different tracks with few special events dropped here and there. It's nothing special.Multiplayer is where this game shines. You have experience level and you get money from races. You buy new cars with in-game money. If you're just starting out you're in bit of a disadvantange because you can't use all cars. Once you're about level 30 you'll have access to all the cars you will ever need. Multiplayer works fine and there aren't any lag issues. It's fun with many people but can get crazy if you have collisions enabled. Most of the matches don't have rammers and even if you get rammed in the beginning you can usually recover if you're a good driver. There are still many players during evenings. If you can't find any matches you need to change you steam download region to London. I think it's the best multiplayer arcade racing game on PC at the moment.That being said I can't wait for GRID Autosport. I expect this game to die once it's released.			"

												All in all, pretty good. I have to admit that the game has been a little glitchy, with my rig crashing an average of once every 45 minutes, but for some reason I keep coming back. Anti-aliasing settings seem to be part of the problem, and once I dialed them in a bit it seems to run a lot better now. There is something about the ambience, the quiet music and the feel of nostalgia. Starting out in your own suburbian garage? A world racing league? It grows on you, fast. The story is not so in-depth that it gets in the way. (I mean you, NFS: Undercover!) Some may say over-simplistic; if you are into being able to control every little setting on your car than this is not for you,  but if you like feeling like you are part of the story, than GRID 2 is...

												I love it! It really thrusts you right into career  mode off the bat, which is actually kind of cool. You start with the worst Mustang ever and gradually make your way up through different and more interesting cars. I love being able to customize my paint. All my cars are green, except for my BR-Z, which is pink.Unlike Gran Turismo or something like that, you don't tune your own cars in this game. As someone who usually enjoys this, it's actually nice to not have to. You just get your car and it's good to go. It does a good job of getting you driving as soon as possible. It strikes a great balance between fun and difficulty, always giving you a bit more to go after, but not making it unattainable.The graphics and sound are incredibly engaging as well; it's a fantastically cinematic game. The only better thing is that it performs pretty well on middle-of-the-ground hardware. If you like cars, buy it!			"

												I'm a big fan of racing games. I'v played all different types and Grid 2 is by far one of my favourites. If you are looking for realism this is not the game for you, as the cars handle like they are mad of wafers and and go around corners like train locomotives and the game lacks a cockpit view which is a big disapointment in a racing game. Aside from these small, minor details, this game probably has one of the best atmospheres of any racing game. The game perfectly captures the almost religious racing culture and anyone can feel like a superstar or racing legend when they play this game. The races themselves feel intense and fluid and have some hair rasing moments when you sail centimetres from a shear cliff.			"

Its the kind of game thats difficult to stop playing. I use the Dual Shock 4 controller with this game and it feels great. I dont typically play alot of racing games. But there are times that I feel like playing them and this one is a great one. If you want a great looking racer with a great feel to the cars then you will like this. If your looking for hyper realism, thats not what this game is going for. Its got basic car stats, but I do find that each car has a unique feel to the controls.			"

												Pro: very enjoyable, many cars available (especially with DLC), easy to start with (auto-tuned difficulty), bumper view just perfectCons: strange physics (if you hit a car, it doesn't move while when a car hit you, pray to stay on track), lack of customization (technical parts), sometimes frustrating, external view without speed impressionWhile being nice to the eye, Grid2 is quite strange compared to Grid1, which managed physics rules more fairly. After 10 hours of playing, I have to admit I enjoyed this title for, let's say, 80% of the time while the remainder was full of frustrations. Where is car customization? Why do AIs have so many advantages over the ""poor"" human player? Why your car does feel light as a feather whiler opponent's weights tons?Anyway, had you played Grid1 - and liked it -, this one really worths it. Let's hope that sequels will have some improvements anyway (not tested the new one, though, I'd give it a try when I change my Hardware ;-))			"

												I bought this game a few weeks after its release. I enjoyed the first Grid game and played it for hours buildingup my team and customising my cars. The instant I started up this game, I was initially filled the excitement, wanting it to be as good as the last Grid game, but I soon lost love for this game in the first few races of playing it. Every car seemed to be set-up to drift and not actually go round corners at high speed, gripping the road. But it's far from it. I only played this game for about an hour or so. The game made me feel like the crapest driver in the world, even on easy difficulty i couldn't come close to getting first.I've played many racing games, Forza 3, Forza 4, Forza horizon, the original Grid, WRC, Colin Mcrae and so on. At least in those games io could come first even on moderate settings. Ijust couldn't get into Grid 2, so I stopped playing it.A year later I thought that I'd give it a go again. But it was the same story again. Every car drifted, AI just drove straight into you, like they didn't even knwo that you were there.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, and I'd advise anyone to stay well clear from this game.

												This game has obvious limitations (no cockpit view, scarce customization, a handling model that emphasizes drifting around corners), but if you can look past these this is a pretty decent game. The graphics are impressive, particularly in some of the city based tracks. The career mode encourages experimentation and variety (there is no need to grind for credits, as cars are given out like candy). The presentation is quite nice as well. GRID 2 is a nice game to tide racing fans over on PC until games like Project CARS and Assetto Corsa are fully finished.			"

The handling physics are also pretty good, the idea of drifitng around the track in order to go the fastest possible, is actually surprsingly good, and gives the game a great arcade feel to it. I'm not disappointed and am looking forward for future GRID titles. As a Reloaded edition owner, the DLC's are very worth while in my opinion, 50$ worth of items for just an extra 20$. That's a good deal. This game is one of the best PC games out there for the PC. My only wish is for Drag Races in the next GRID title.To conclude my review, the game is probably the best Racing Game on Steam. Keep up the good work, codemasters!Rating: 9.1/10 "

												NEED HELP!This is a good game however with my Logitech F710- Cordless Rumberpad 2, I've problems with steering. I tried setting to D-input then go to steamapps-grid 2 then under grid 2 input into the folder: i edited dininput default, Logitech F710 input, steering inputs etc./ still unable to figure it out.The problem with steering just puts this game completely off and irrelavant and I am unable to control it as it is too difficult to steer due to its sensitivity and issues with as it keeps going off track. And into the game always end up as last RACER.It rendered this game completely useless and worthless to play to steering issues please help: even looking into this forums-http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=35085100                 it still unsolved as i am not a programming expert. I figured that quote ""Steering –Increasing the DEADZONE can make the car feel less twitchy.Decrease the SATURATION if you feel the steering is not sensitive enough.Increase LINEARITY if you are finding it too difficult to hold the car in a straight line. (Can use negative numbers if needed)""Linearity can be edited but where do i find that in the game specific folder and after countless tweaking and tweaking still cannot solve the problem cannot go to advanced menu in game etc.../ i close the game always with unsucessful tweak.Linearity is important for me, as i always cannot drive the car in straight line centered, please help me steam or any experts out there...Thank-you-for-reading.

												Great game, despite it being overshadowed by the first GRIDGood:Great graphicsGood damage model (the way the game interprets damage to the car)nice controls/handlingMeh:Physics can be a little tempermental (such as hitting a car mid-air and it doesn't move an inch off it's course while you come to a dead stop)little hard not to drift every corner, despite it being faster on many corners to hold the line, the cars all want to swing their back end outPoor: no open-wheel classsome debris is phased (can't hit it, it can't hit you), especially noticable in the demolition derby (I know it's a DLC, but still)(This is a personal idea/view) The season style got downgraded, you don't have the choice to race where you want to race, when you want to race, how you want to race, you'r emore or less forced into a country to race there for a season, and then the 4/5th seasons are some combination of all three countries. I personally don't care for this type of setup for seasons, and there isn't a season ending race, like the 24 hours of le Mans.With GRID as the standard at 10/10, I have to rate this, GRID 2, at 8/10 or so			"

												Definitely a Good game. The graphics are great and as long as you don't play 3rd person. (Bumper cam ftw) The game feels very fast. Works perfectly with my G27 which is huge. Lots of controller options so you are able to get exactly what you need. Other than that the only downside is they pulled back on customizations over the first one. Even tho you can still purchase upgrades like engine etc. It still would have been nice to have some extra tuning capabilities. All in all this game is exactly what I was looking for.			"

												After playing RaceDriver Grid I knew I wanted Grid 2. After watching some video's of gameplay, I was skeptical. I decided to give it a try. The first 25 min almost made me stop playing altogether, luckily I pushed on.After season 1 I fell in love with Grid 2, I could start to feel minor differences in the handling of different cars. I really really wanted it to have a cockpit view like Grid 1, but learned to live with a different view. I would recommend this game to Grid fans, it really is not as bad as everyone says.			"

												Very good racing game. It even has splitscreen feature!In many ways I think this game is better than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,even though Need for Speed has some compelling features and charisma.I love the menues in Grid 2, because they are fast so I don't get bored. If there is some information I can always move on as I want. N4S lacked of this.It's a really creative game with social media, humor and fans. You create a fanbasewhile competing in your career.I like the engine sounds in N4S more than in Grid 2, but Grid 2 is really nice anyway.Grid 2 is more up-to-date, with great online features etc.			"

The racing physics engine is fine no issues there, but it also seems dull. Thee game runs like a set of random races, arcade style. I never felt immeresed like I had with for instance Carbon. I also found mself missing car customization sure, you can change the apperance of the car however, you cant do anything to change how it drives. If you want an arcade game go ahead and buy the game while heavily discounted otherwise save your cash for another time.			"

												Beautiful to look at, stunning models. While the driving experience for the first GRID was more realistic, GRID 2 is a little more arcade-y, probably to make it more accessable. Unlike most of the PC competition, especially compared the N4S franchise, you get the sense that this game was made by people who understand love for cars, much like the Forza series. If you're tired of racing games for bro's *cough Need For Speed cough*, this is a pretty decent choice.			"

												I have really been enjoying GRID 2. It is a hybrid sim/arcade racer. By that I mean you do need to break, and you do need to know how to go around corners, but with a very high incorporation of drifting and forgiveness. There are only two real downsides to this game: There are no online games anymore, rendering half of the game useless, and the AI can often times be infuriating. The AI very clearly has a set idea as to what it wants to do, regardless of where or what the players car is doing. There is very clearly no connection between the AI and where the player is.			"

												Grid 2 is a great looking competent racer let down by numerious dumb decisions by Codemasters. Firstly they completely removed the cockpit view leaving you with a crappy bonnet view or outside view. This was probably to save development time but it just felt extremely lazy for a AAA racing title. Secondly they totally overhauled the driving physics. The cars don't feel realistic to drive anymore and you are pretty much forced to drift around every corner to win the races. The racing feels closer to Daytona, Ridge Racer or Outrun which really doesn't mix well with a realistic damage model.Lastly the story is rubbish. You're an up and coming racer taking the social media by storm which just feels really dumb. The cutscenes are cheesy and only get in the way of the racing. Overall the single player just isn't a very fun experience.This only leaves multiplayer and considering the car physics and lack of a cockpit view will turn away most enthusists that played the original game, I can't see many people sticking around for it.Visually it looks good although it loves to throw insane amounts of motion blur and there is some horrendous looking textures under the cars when they start breaking apart. It's definitely the weakest Codemasters game running on the Ego Engine from a visual standpoint.The game is also jam packed full of DLC and you can't acquire many high tier vehicles without dropping extra money into the game. This really makes the game feel incomplete and that's something most people have come to expect from Codemasters sadly.Overall, I'd only give this a look if you're after an arcadey racer and it's extremely cheap. I can't recommend this game to serious racing game fans at all.			"

												GRID 2 Is an amazing racing game. I have loved racing games for many years, and GRID 2 is by far my favourite. The graphics are absolutely beautiful on my 1080p monitor at 60Hz, the controls are easy to learn, and there is a ton of singleplayer and multiplayer content that will keep you on the edge of your seat for hours. I definitly recommend this game.			"

												This game has obvious limitations (no cockpit view, scarce customization, a handling model that emphasizes drifting around corners), but if you can look past these this is a pretty decent game. The graphics are impressive, particularly in some of the city based tracks. The career mode encourages experimentation and variety (there is no need to grind for credits, as cars are given out like candy). The presentation is quite nice as well. GRID 2 is a nice game to tide racing fans over on PC until games like Project CARS and Assetto Corsa are fully finished.			"

												The online game is awful - who has the best car and high level wins. Turning a car while setting its colors made ​​me vomit. The list of players is somewhere behind the screen. Game cars are transparent and pass through each other. Steering wheel definitely better in Grid 1. During the vote maps hard to understand that the map is referring to. Nie zapisuje ustawienia sterowania. Do not write control settings. Every time when I start the game I have to do again (Darkfire Racing Wheel). I return to GRID 1 (online, tunngle).			"

Fantastic car selection (the R34 Z-tune and the Caterham goofy-sounding mini Le Mans are standouts), and plenty of tracks - the touge tracks in Japan are as sparklingly gorgeous as the Dubai downtown routes. Watch out for savedata corruption however; do yourself a favor and disable Steam cloud synchronization.			"

												Pro: very enjoyable, many cars available (especially with DLC), easy to start with (auto-tuned difficulty), bumper view just perfectCons: strange physics (if you hit a car, it doesn't move while when a car hit you, pray to stay on track), lack of customization (technical parts), sometimes frustrating, external view without speed impressionWhile being nice to the eye, Grid2 is quite strange compared to Grid1, which managed physics rules more fairly. After 10 hours of playing, I have to admit I enjoyed this title for, let's say, 80% of the time while the remainder was full of frustrations. Where is car customization? Why do AIs have so many advantages over the ""poor"" human player? Why your car does feel light as a feather whiler opponent's weights tons?Anyway, had you played Grid1 - and liked it -, this one really worths it. Let's hope that sequels will have some improvements anyway (not tested the new one, though, I'd give it a try when I change my Hardware ;-))			"

												I bought this game a few weeks after its release. I enjoyed the first Grid game and played it for hours buildingup my team and customising my cars. The instant I started up this game, I was initially filled the excitement, wanting it to be as good as the last Grid game, but I soon lost love for this game in the first few races of playing it. Every car seemed to be set-up to drift and not actually go round corners at high speed, gripping the road. But it's far from it. I only played this game for about an hour or so. The game made me feel like the crapest driver in the world, even on easy difficulty i couldn't come close to getting first.I've played many racing games, Forza 3, Forza 4, Forza horizon, the original Grid, WRC, Colin Mcrae and so on. At least in those games io could come first even on moderate settings. Ijust couldn't get into Grid 2, so I stopped playing it.A year later I thought that I'd give it a go again. But it was the same story again. Every car drifted, AI just drove straight into you, like they didn't even knwo that you were there.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, and I'd advise anyone to stay well clear from this game.

												ONLINE GAME PLAY-Grid2 is pure arcade. The fastest way around a corner in the Grid2 universe is to approach the corner at full speed and throw the car in sideways, sliding all the way around (although this is different to the drift technique within the game). This technique is hard to grasp for some people who are used to real world physics resulting in hugely varied skill levels making online racing boring - no close racing.I found if I created an online game and invited friends who did not have the same downloaded content as me (even if I didnt select race settings that use the downloaded content) my friends could not join.I like the in game voice chat. While loading new races it would break up a little, but I guess that's to be expected.Finding an open online game is near impossible. It is region based, so you cant join a game out side of your region. i.e. I can only join games hosted in Australia.All of the people I race with are 30 plus, some with families. So they don't play regularly, the problem with this results in a very slow climb in XP points and cash, which allows you to modify your vehicles or buy new ones. In this respect I wish all cars were available from the get go in online mode.CONTROLLER SETUP -I use a Logitech G27 steering wheel and pedals controller. I had to download and install the Logitech profile software, tweak settings in there and then tweak settings within Grid2 for the controller to feel 'right'. It took a lot of mucking around and research, which was a little annoying. Once setup, it was great.In game sometimes the controller would not respond correctly. Seemed like the calibration was lost, but a restart of the game and controller power cycle would usually fix it - annoying if you've just hosted a game and need to quit the session to reset your controller. This would happen to both me and a friend with the exact same controller.CONCLUSIONOverall its a great game. I've had a lot of fun playing it online with friends. "

												This game is excellent! All though theres no Cockpit view, it's not a game ruiner. I love the fact that theres more custmaztion options now, and it makes the game better in my opinion. The handling physics are also pretty good, the idea of drifitng around the track in order to go the fastest possible, is actually surprsingly good, and gives the game a great arcade feel to it. I'm not disappointed and am looking forward for future GRID titles. As a Reloaded edition owner, the DLC's are very worth while in my opinion, 50$ worth of items for just an extra 20$. That's a good deal. This game is one of the best PC games out there for the PC. My only wish is for Drag Races in the next GRID title.To conclude my review, the game is probably the best Racing Game on Steam. Keep up the good work, codemasters!Rating: 9.1/10 "

WOW they are amazing. There is tons and tons of cars to unlock, it is just epic. I would rate it 8/10 because this game is a bit hard. espcially for young gamers who want to play this, it gets really hard and annoying. like when you get in a spin, (it happens ALOT) it is ANNOYING. and when driving a fast car, it SPINS, when driving a slow car, you come LAST. but still it is a great racing game that I would recommand to alot of racing fans.Da BossNugget out.

												Grid 2 is an alright game. The career is fun, the handling is not too bad, and AI's are fairly even to you. I know it may not be as good as Grid and does not have a cockpit mode, but it still stands as decent in my opinion.The handling is pretty good, but the problem may be collisions. Sometimes, hitting a rock cliff throws you way into the air, and hitting another car from behind makes you spin out uncontrollably.The missions are decently entertaining, but do get old, and they slowly get annoyingly longer distances, allowing for fewer mistakes. I find this painfully annoying.The graphics are good, even on low, and the world is well made. Although it is a bit demanding PC wise if you want to play without everything on ""off"" or ""low"".Overall decent, good details, and not too bad on handling or world design. Probably a solid 7.5/10.			"

												So contrary to the negative reviews, I love this game. I picked up this game just yesterday on sale and it's the best 7 bucks I have ever spent. I see a lot of people saying that this game is all about drifting, and it isn't. Yes it's a big pat but you can easily make those turns by simply hitting the break and slowing down and make the turn and keep up with the competition. I love this game because to me it is more arcade like in terms of steering the car. The graphics are amazing. I only have GTX 760 and I can play the game on Ultra. The car selection and customazation is not the greatest but enough to satisfy. Overall this is probably the best 7 bucks I spent on steam.			"

												Good game and all but why is there so much ice? it makes cornering with keyboard and mouse impossible as there is no actual trigger on a keyboard which allows you to gently slow down, instead on this game it just instantly slams on brakes and spins you out. not even had the game an hour yet and its♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. also the AI, its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. literally, they can smash through a 2 ton Ford Mach 1 in a 1.5 ton Nissan Silvia no matter where they hit me, also if i even so much as tap one, or think about tapping one, i smash up and then theres the events. the event which has you filter through the pickups with flashing lights, well i tried filtering when it said ""They're evenly spaced so that you can filter through"", im sorry but having all of them bumper to bumper and smashing into each other smashing my car up and the other racer and having me only win because my car was only just able to move at 2 mph with -12,800 points while the other racer which was AI had -700,000 points and no wheels which resulted in me lapping him while being pushed sideways around the track with no wheels as the pickups were pushing me, is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥take. no way is this game realistic enough to be played for a long time. im giving up already after playing about 15 min... will try and get into it again in the morning, but as of right now its almost 4am, i need my sleep.

												If you played Grid, and want to give this game a try because you loved Grid, I would not bother. Because that was me, and I was pretty disappointed by this game. First of all, if you don't have a steering wheel, this game will essentially require one. Also, this game was really designed for kids. The driving is like Need for Speed: Most Wanted, where every turn is a drift and you will eventually just be moping through the game. There are actually too many cars; there too many cars that noone cares about, if that's better. I spent 11 hours to get to classes that aren't even remotely different from the starting class.The graphics are better, to an extent, but way less detailed as Grid. Grid was also way more satisfying, because they also removed the cockpit veiw. The maps are way less interesting and are a total snooze fest. The maps in Grid were better. Way better. I also hate the guy who does things over the mic. He's annoying. And he sounds like he's talking to a 10 year old.In short, this game is meant for a totally different age group. I wouldn't recommend it to any fellow gamer, but maybe for thier kids.			"

												GRID 2 manages to inject a nice dose of realistic physics within an arcade style racing game. The result is a game that simulator purists will surely frown upon.... (lack of view, no tuning) but everyone else will enjoy. The locations and cars look absolutely stunning. The single player is meaty and the multiplayer is absolutely worth playing			"

												Welcome to GRID 2, the GRID game that doesn't have a cockpit view, and the land of Train-racers. The A.I. are so dedicated to their line that they might as well be trains on a track, just sliding through, perfect braking, perfect cornering, perfect everything. Though playing with a friend makes this game much better, playing it alone is just tough. Also, if you think I just suck at the game, yes I do. I am terrible at this because I do not have a decent controller to play on this game, only my keyboard which I am not used to. Regardless, this game is still fun with friends even if the A.I. is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. TL;DR, A.I. are trains, fun with friends. Play if you enjoy arcade-y racing.			"

												The pros:- Great game for you if you like racing games with no open world.- It's easy to control. My 5yo learned fast and loved it. I bought for him.- It has a flashback feature which feels totally like cheating but well... it's in the game so...- Graphics are awesome.The cons:- Price is high for what it delivers.- No car mods.- The base game gets you so few cars. They removed like 90% of the cars of the main game and put them on DLCs for sale.- Won't let you skip cutscenes. I hate games who do that. The impression is that the game thinks its cutscenes are SO AMAZING that you should see them. Not only cutscenes but you also can't skip little transitions in the game, which is annoying.- On windows 7, alt tab will mess up video resolution and sometimes not even get input anymore, only after restarting the game.- No real ""first person"" view with handle bar and everything. Also no handbrake controls, you'll have to drift with your regular brakes. Also no mirrors, but you do see a little arrow when cars are close to you.			"

												For starters, I'm not really sure if I really like this game or if it's starting to get really annoying.As someone who really liked the first GRID, GRID 2 starts off nicely. The somewhat familiar handling and feel to the cars is there, the atmosphere is nice and especially the tracks feel nice. The UI is straightforward and easy to use, but maybe a bit on the slow side when it comes to the garage and customizing liveries for your car.So far, I'm having fun. I'm getting a good feel with the cars and handling, I get to know most of the tracks and all seems fun and games. But once you start progressing in the game, the infamous bots start to get annoying really fast. The back of the pack brakes really, really early into corners, cuts you off intentionally from overtaking and you literally have to sit there and watch as the top 3 bots get further and further away. You literally have to plow your way into the top 3, no bumbers spared, at which point the leading cars have gotten way too far away to catch up. So you restart. Over and over and over again until the AI screws up and you get a run where you get to the head of the pack early and have a decent chance.That's when I started to realize that there really hasn't been any feel of being the better driver in this game. Sure, your cornering improves over time and you get to know the tracks but most of the time youre just fighting the same AI that literally feels scripted with the head of the pack always pulling really far ahead and the rest of the bots are there just to ♥♥♥♥ you in the♥♥♥♥♥There is, however, some difference to the types of race youre attending. Regular races and time trials give you the most pain with bots, elimination and face-offs feel decent enough and enduraces are ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty. Still, on my first playthrough few years back after GRID 2 was released, I remember having tons of fun and maybe I'll get that feeling again once I finish the game a second time. I heard online-play is decent but with quirks of its own but I haven't tried it for myself.TL,DR; Recommended but with reservations, decent arcade racing to enjoy on your own or with friends. Steam Controller recommended. Race Restarters' GRID  "

												Poor FPS: runs fine for first few races then for some reasons starts to slow down and down and down...Edit: OK, I have figured why the frame rate drops; it is because I have my logitech wheel attached...which is pretty stupid for a racing game which doesn't run smoothly with a wheel attached. As soon as you disconnect the wheel (i.e. use a controller instead) the game runs really well! Given that this Codemaster game don't expect any fixes as they normally abandon the game after a few months,If you play with controller then this is a good arcade racing game.			"

												Although I like to play Assetto Corsa racing simulator, I really enjoyed GRID 2's driving model on both Keyboard and Xbox 360 controller. This driving model has great fast and responsive feeling and at the same time it doesn't feel that stupid like some Need for Speed like games.There are 4 categories and every car in its category has really different feel and in reality it is much better alternative to tuning and upgrading cars - you just take different car for different driving style.Flashback system is simple and just working great. This version of flashback should be in all Codemasters games.Summary: It has the best from arcade and simulation games. Simplicity, instant action and at the same time variety and surprisingly believable, nonalien driving model.			"

												Visually stunning and a nice simulation driving experience.  My two negatives are music options, how hard is it to embed a streaming music service into the engine? Attach to a Pandora, Spotify, or simlar service and it seems we would have a better personally tailored soundtrack. Licensing I think would be the issue but still.. dreams. The 2nd downside is the lack of a cockpit view.  As is the closet I can get is with my face on the hood staring at the ram air scoop. While that is still a nice picture some vehicles it is easy to lose the center causing for some confusion while driving.			"

I was really looking forward to the online competitive play but I found out that the community has ...

												Arghhh!  The mandatory career story line at the beginning is tedious.  Is this an RPG or a racing/sim game?  The game appears to be useful as an introductory type game, though.  And, once you get past the opening career races in the crappy Mustang, the races are more fun.  The DLC's improved the playability exponentially.  Haven't tried multi-player yet...  I purchased the game 66% off.  At that price the game is worth getting, but wouldn't recommend at full price.			"

The multiplayer is pretty much dead because bugs and Codemasters did not have any form of anti cheat in the begining few months of this release.  It got very ugly racing online. It was not fun at all, and our cries for bans and a anti cheat seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. To be honest, the first GRiD was far superior to this game in every aspect. But like I said, buy it when it goes on sale, it's still worth getting.			"

												It's hard to make a review for GRID 2 , long story short as for my taste and expectations I won't Recommend this. But don't let my review think GRID 2 it's a bad game. Why I won't recommend GRID 2 is , for Im more into Simulation Racing. Compared GRID 1 and GRID 2 , GRID 2 it's more of an Arcade style. What I hate most about GRID 2 is the constant oversteer which is actually aim towards for people who likes to see their car drift throughout the entire game. Which also casues bad experience for me as if you tries to turn bit harder your car will automatically oversteers and into a drift which is so unrealstic. I know cars tend to oversteer but not this freaking sensitive and easily. I would Recommend GRID 2 for those who are Casual Racers while those who are looking for a more realistic or simulation racing games best stay clear of GRID 2			"

												Many people criticize this game for what they wanted it to be, rather then what the game trys to be. This game is arcady drifty slidy physics. Which aren't bad, I enjoy flinging cars around corners sometimes. GRID 2's physics are RELIABLE, if you start drifting and know how to control it, you can do very well. You have to learn the foreign physics model before you can truely do well.Personally, I like GRID Autosport more since it is a bit more simulatory (?) but I still enjoy a GOOD arcade racer, which GRID 2 delivers.

												While I really enjoyed the first GRID, GRID 2 leaves me wanting a lot more out of my racing experience.Make no mistake, this is not a simulator, nor should it be reviewed as one. This is an arcade racer with simulator-esque physics. What I mean is this: At the highest levels (Season 5 supercars, etc)Racing a ""GRIP"" car will feel slow, when in comparison to the other cars, you're going fairly fast.Racing a ""Balanced"" car will feel like you should be drifting a lot more than you are, but the car feels like it's on training wheelsRacing a ""DRIFT"" car will feel like your tires are made of ice and no matter what you do the car will not cooperate.I would prefer that my racing games fit into one category or the other when it comes to street racing (not DiRTs. DiRTs are awesome as-is)When a driving game with arcade steering has simulation knife's-edge cornering, I find it much harder to enjoy.TL;DR: The first 4 seasons and 25 hours are fun. Really fun. However, this game is dated enough that multiplayer is dead, so unless you plan on racing with friends in your living room/split screen, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game.			"

												GRID 2 is a racing game where your car is made to drift every corner, does that appeal to you? Then play it, for me it completely killed the game, it was a huge disappointment after the first GRID, which was a great arcade game. I wasn't expecting any great simulator for what its worth, but please, don't make me drift at every corner, simple as that.This game had a lot of potential but the terrible gameplay is not worth it, just play GRID Autosport instead which is a FAAAAR better game.

												Corner cutting detected!This game has a lot of potential. I was drawn to the Grid games because they were challenging. You could ramp up the difficulty to a setting that makes the races fun but still has you trying to outbrake into corners or trying to get the best line to drive onto the straight.The previous ""Grid"" had it's issues but was a fun game. It often felt like the other cars were attached to you by rubber band and that you couldn't get too far ahead without them hitting ludicrous speed  to catch up. It's main problem was that you never knew where you were going to start on the grid. You could be in the 5th round of a race, having won every other round, but still end up starting in some random, mid pack position.That same random start issue happens again in this. It feels like they have got the physics right, the cars handle well and you get the feeling that the opposition aren't 'on rails' as much as some other ghames. If you ram them, they'll move but you will take on damage as well. The car models look great and the smoke, crowds, general background are very smooth and really help you to get into the game. The replay function is a lot better than in the previous version. Graphoics art, in general,  beautiful with some great reflections going on.There are a couple of small issues that you can get past with some work. The main computer character/bot: Carter is way better than all of the other racers. It's almost like they don't matter.My main issue with this game is the dreaded ""corner cutting detected"" which kicks in if you leave the track on one of the 'proper' circuits. The game penalises you by slowing you down to sub-30mph for a few seconds while you are on the track, as if your car is fitted with some sort of tracker that can physically slow you down.It happens when you cut a corner but It happens when you get pushed out wide by other cars. It happens when you drive a little wide to avoid a pile up. It can even happen when you spin out.It's not every race, It's not even every track, but it is immensely frustrating when it does happen and it sucks all of the fun out ouf this game for me.2 hours into it and i'm considering uninstalling it because of this issue.A shame really. Like I said, a lot of potential.Grid: Racedriver gave me around 30+ hours of solid racing. I was hoping this would be even better. It looks like I have to find another racing game to sink my time into.			"

												This game looks quite gorgeous.  The graphics have had a real step up, there's some really good paint options available, reflections look amazing.  This would be a great game as long as all you ever do is look at it.As soon as you start to actually play it, that is where the game begins to fall apart.  The key to GRID 2 is simple:  Drift.  The first tier of cars you obtain in career mode, every single car in season one - even with DLC - is a Drift car.  And there's a reason for this.  Once you finally do work your way up the ladder, you do tart unlocking other cars.  But even with other control schemes, ""balance"", ""grip"", there is only one way to take corners with any speed:  Drifting.And even this wouldn't be as bad if it had the same more realistic drifting controls as the previous game.  But this game doesn't.  Not by a long shot.  While it may be better than the infamously bad Ridge Racer series, Codemasters has decided to throw away all pretense of a ""racing simulator"" and give us crappy arcade drifting physics.  Every car will under-steer unless you hit the breaks to throw the back end out.  Every.  Single.  Car.  Every track is made for drifting around sharp bends.  Every race expect you to drift if you want any sort of reasonable time.  Simply put, if you aren't drifting, you aren't winning.On top of that, the career tournament, sponsor, money/reputation system of the previous game is gone.  Replaced with a ""social media"" story, complete with ESPN interludes (who've proven they will do anything for a pay check whether it has any sense of reality or not).  You win races to earn ""fans"" (reputation).  Cars are just given to you, you choose between usually two - which are either virtually identical in stats or one will be a clear advantage - and you can unlock the other in a time trial.  The goal of the game is to impress drivers from other racing circuits to join your racing circuit by beating them in races.  Let me put that another way:  The goal is to impress enough fans that your brand new, all-styles racing circuit is totally for realsies by attracting drivers that you, personally, have bested in their own circuits, on their own tracks, against their own specialties.  And now you want to race them off type, off class, and against each other to give credibility for your fantasy league.  Yea, this is so much better than just, you know, trying to earn trophies from existing events.On top of that, the AI has taken a huge step back from the previous game.  Whereas in previous game, drivers had skill sets, they had favorite types, and - most importantly - they made mistakes, here we are back to AI that was laughable twenty years ago.  They follow their racing line.  They drive a little slower if they're out front, so that you can catch up, and a little faster if they're behind you (rubber band AI).  They don't care if they hit a wall, they don't care if you're in the way, they don't care if you try to spin them.  They will stick to their racing line and that is it.But wait, there's more.  In their infinite wisdom, Codemasters has added a few new race types, and of course removed some old favorites.  One of the new events, Live Routes, is a race track that is dynamically altered as you race.  In other words, you have to picture that there are people who, once a few cars go buy, run out and reset the direction of the track.  Constantly.  In a game filled with unrealistic, idiotic choices, this one takes the cake.Edit:  There is also the dreaded, obsolete, should not be seen in any video game post 2000 checkpoint racing.  This was a mechanic invented for arcade machines back when you had to continually put quarters in them every 90 seconds in order for them to earn money.  You have a time limit, and each checkpoint adds a little bit to it - not enough to get to the next point on its own, so that you will eventually run out.  It has absolutely no place in home games.  This mechanic needs to die.  Even though it is used here slightly differently than in the old arcade games, here it's set up as an actual competetion - which is probably the best use you can make out of it - checkpoint racing has left such a dirty taste in my mouth from so many games that I just cannot respect any racing game that includes it anymore.  This isn't the only thing either.  Elimination, the way they have the ""5 second rule"" to Togue.  This game has completely forgone ""simulation"" for ""arcade"".  While some players may like that, having race styles that can only really be done IN a video game... After the first GRID game, this is not at all what I wanted to see in the sequel.  I have no problem if that's the game that they wanted to make... but it should not be titled GRID 2.There are better racing games out there.  If you haven't already played the first GRID, go give that one a shot.  The cars there feel good, the game looks good, the races make sense, the AI is competitive, and most importantly, that game is far more FUN.  But hey, at least you can have pearlescent paint if you buy this one instead - though you can never remove your sponsors.			"

												When purchasing grid 2, I had expected a serious racing game, like how grid 1 had the sponsoring, lemans, and all the official racing events, and when I walked into grid 2, all I got was an arcade-like drift racer. I'm very dissatisfied with the game, nor can I get a refund because I spent an hour and a half trying to get it to run on my computer, then another hour trying to find the more serious events. I recommend only for someone looking for a drift racing game. It's excellent in that regard, but not for a simulation game.			"

												This is a really good, solid racing game. GRID 2 is fast-pased, speedy and exiting driving experience. I never imagine that passing someone would be so much fun! The driving is thrilling and racing makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The graphics are a big plus too, beautiful landscapes and lens flares look really astonishing.Unlike getting more exp you get more fans, which is pretty unique and fun thing to have. The whole athmosphere of the game is so uplifting and, in a sertain way, relaxing that it had to be mentioned. If there would be any bad thing to say about this, it would defintelty be the difficulty of this game. This is a quite hard racing game even in a most easiest settings, especially for those with no racing game experience. Other than that, GRID 2 is easily above average racing game, with fantastic graphics and athmosphere.3/5 The scenery was so beautifull that i accidentaly drove of the cliff			"

												I had a brief experience with Grid 2This negative review I want to preface is for the attention of people not regular to the racing genre whom may want to get a rare fix and are thinking of this game to get that doneDon't.There's better out there for our kindSo the asshat narrator is useless for a start - ""catch your back end"", ""balance your speed"" that's all he's got for me - how about tell me what button combinations to press at which speedsThis was after the first warning flag had reared its ugly head though, the first achievement pops and it’s titled “Here’s my number, Call me maybe?” I don’t have any problems with that scene, it’s not mine, there’s a good chance that if the racing genre isn’t part of your regular sensibilities then a game that makes those kinds of references may just annoy you tooFinally I am having a mess around the test track and I decide I’m done for my first session (at this point fairly sure I’ll at least play it one more time) when the game throws me into an unskippable cutscene like somehow their video of their schmuck stock racing character is so good that it demands my time with no option of me bypassing itIt was at this point that I decided Grid 2 is a game that is not meant for me, which means there’s a chance that it might be a game that's not meant for you either			"

												The number of pros in the game outweighs the cons. The severity however is another story.The way I see it, there is a huge flaw with the handling. It is unreliable and unpredictable, often failing you when you need precision. It is too responsive and sensitive and makes timetrials and powerlaps a pain. Regular races are fine as the AI on normal and below are dumbed down way too much. Driving in this game is like flying a jet fighter, You'll do fine at high speeds but when you try to move around at low speeds or need to stop, the whole thing shakes apart.			"

												Been playing for about 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes) when writing this, and I'm loving it! I was hoping for a game that you started off with a bad car and upgraded it over time, and that you get fans so quickly and easily, not really realistic. Still love driving as a whole in this game and drifting! :) I recommend it if you like racing games (obviously!)			"

												This is an amazingly fun and addicting game, however, it has some major issues that need to be addressed, particularly with it just being able to simply run. I've found that after about 30 minutes of straight play, it starts crashing and rebooting every other race. In the middle of the freaking race. It's ridiculous. I can be almost through with the entire race, then the sound goes out and it totally crashes before automatically rebooting itself. And it obviously doesn't save any data from the race. So if nothing else, that's what would be holding be back from recommending this game. If a fix comes out for it, then I'll be sure to edit the review.Overall: 4/10Fun, but has some major problems.

												There are lots of racing games that are much, much better and fun to play. - Drifting is quite terrible, and there are lots of tracks and cars intended for drifting. This becomes especially irritating when you are forced to race 3 times in a row on the same track.- Physics is total crap.- Menus feel too heavy and slow.- It's too hard to determine which car you should take, their stats all look the same, but handling differs significantly.- Difficulty is not uniform - most challenges are fine, but there are some ridiculously hard ones.- Lots of DLCs.- Maps get too repetitive.- Music? What music?Just pick any other racing game and it will likely be better. Even Grid 1 was better.			"

												Grid was great, Grid 2 is awesome. The inclusion of dynamic routes means that it's less about learning a route and more about responsive driving. Yes, it's a game not a simulator but let's face it, without a full-on rig of some kind it's always going to be a game so let's enjoy the play! Grid was great (although I never managed the full 24-hour Le Mans despite having camped through a real one) and Grid 2 is an interesting progression. The story is just about enough to hang the events together but the progression is challenging and not impossible, that's all I want from a game.			"

												I've nearly played this game twice through, and I'm still loving it. I wish there were a few more actual racing tracks than street circuits but the game, particularly in the latter stages, is hard enough to keep your interest. There is plenty of DLC available but a bit expensive for my tastes, I did buy the Spa DLC when there was a special offer on and may buy more if that offer comes up again. I'm running this game on low graphic detail but at 1080p on a fairly old PC and it runs fine.For me the game gets a 9 out of 10....but then I do love racing games.			"

												Codemasters has slowly built themselves a good reputation. They were once an exploitative company that made some sub-par games, but their acquisition of the Colin McCrae license really pushed them to develop some truly awesome racing games.While I'm more partial to off-road and rally racing, I do dabble in standard NASCAR/Le Mans style games, too. Sadly, I can't say that Grid 2 offers anything over other racing games to truly justify a purchase.For starters, the physics are just wack. Sometimes you hit curves and the game will register is as a head-on collision. Other times, you tip a car and go flying through the air. Then there are races where everything works perfectly and you're left wondering why you didn't crash.The course selection is also pretty lacking. While there are variations of each city, I can't recall more than 12 different tracks. The career mode makes you race the same circuits to a nauseating degree. I'm so sick of being in Dubai (which is saying a lot as I love India).The career mode, itself, it also just very lackluster. While I understand that deviating too much from standard racing may make this into an extreme sports title, the lack of variance just grates on you after awhile. Couple that with later seasons being bloated beyond reason and I can't even bring myself to finish season 5.There is no reason why making an event longer should be substituted for actual difficulty. Including different tracks or upgrading cars should be what makes the game harder. Making me do a 7 minute endurance race where the rubber banding AI breaks ahead of me in the last 10 seconds is rubbish.The car selection is okay. The progression system borrows a lot from the Dirt series in that you gradually unlock better cars by winning events. That takes away a lot of the bologna from games like Forza and Gran Turismo where funds were needed, but it also makes a lot of the beginning cars completely worthless in the end game.There is a tiny bit of a car customization system, but it is severely lacking. The ""liveries"" are familiar in execution to how Need For Speed: Underground allowed you to customize a car, but even that game had the option of tweaking performance and tuning. Grid 2 doesn't have much.To cap it all off, there isn't even a dashboard viewpoint. You either have a far too close zoom, a too far away zoom, a first person view of nothing, or just your hood. Codemasters' decision was that Grid 2 was more action based, but I don't buy that for a second.For a racing game to be more action oriented, it should have tight controls. Often times I can't get my car to consistently brake in the same fashion. Other times, I can drift like a master. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to how the game will work.So is there anything good about the game? Well, the beginning few seasons aren't bad. The races are kept short and different event types are sprinkled throughout. You get some Drift action, a gametype called Togue that is similar to face-off, but requires you don't contact with your opponent and even a cool variant of old-school arcade style racing with Checkpoint.After the mid-way point, though, the game just forgets about most of these events. You get stuck with standard races and endurance cups that just keep getting longer and longer. It just becomes monotonous and aggravating.The only way I'd recommend this game is during a Steam sale. At $30, it is far too expensive to just out-right buy. That the DLC is basically just better cars is also garbage, but I guess you could grab those if you want the game to be easier.Still, there are a ton of better racing games on Steam (Grid Autosport being one of them). You can do a lot better than this strange little game.5/10			"

I was pleasantly surprised with a visually great game with excellent handling and a fluid, more importantly fun, campaign.  As a fan of driving games I was interested in the handling and control of the cars (Xbox Controller).  The game has the feel of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (one of my all time favs) but a little tighter on the drifts.  Not as touchy as Forza 2 but certainly not as demanding as the Gran Turismo series.  Well worth whatever I bought it for on a Steam sale.  My only complaint is a lack of a soundtrack or radio options but I usually run background players anyway.			"

												This game has so much squandared potential... Great visuals, amazing audio, distinct characteristics for each car (handling feel, acceleration, etc), but fails spectacularly in the campaign. The AI absolutely CANNOT pass. They do not yield to the faster car (race regulations), and when they attempt a pass, instead of going around you they simply press into your rear bumper until the physics engine decides the appropriate action is to have your car spin out into the nearest retaining wall.I'm thankful for the flasbacks, because one thing is for sure, you'll need them.What also drives me insane is your race manager, with such helpful insights as, ""Keep pushing, go for first!"".

												I have really been enjoying GRID 2. It is a hybrid sim/arcade racer. By that I mean you do need to break, and you do need to know how to go around corners, but with a very high incorporation of drifting and forgiveness. There are only two real downsides to this game: There are no online games anymore, rendering half of the game useless, and the AI can often times be infuriating. The AI very clearly has a set idea as to what it wants to do, regardless of where or what the players car is doing. There is very clearly no connection between the AI and where the player is.			"

												The gameplay isn't bad, but I as well as many others have had problems with microstuttering fps that affects the controlability of the cars during a race.

This is the last game I'm buying from codemasters, as there has been no support or feedback from the issue and I can't imagine they would continue to fix bugs when they can just make new games. /sEDIT 2: Fast forward 2 years, much upgraded system (i5 6600k, 16gb ram, gtx 1070) the game still has absolutely terrible fps hitching. I cannot believe in the awful support for your games and stand by my statement that I will no longer purchase any of your future titles.			"

												Seemed nice while I only had access to slow cars.All started getting ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier after season 2 of WSR.Pros: The graphics look great.Cons:* AI always run on max speed in corners without starting to drift or spinout and the car type only changes how YOUR car handles,* Controls of this game are awful: even when using analog input, it's either max or zero turn left/right,* Some events don't allow to make a contact with other cars - it doesn't matter who hits who, you always get disqualified for that,* You're drifting 100% of the time: even when going without acceleration in corners, if you turn to the side, the car starts drifting.Basically it's impossible to play this game if you don't get a good racing wheel for your PC. I started playing on medium difficulty, but in season 2 had to change to easy and in season 3 changed to very easy, as the cars got more and more uncontrollable, while the opponents were going at max speed with no control issues.

												A fun game with good graphics and enough content to keep you busy for a long time . Very weak multiplayer .			"

												38 Minutes before I quit. I didn't like being pigeonholed into RWD drift setups. I may try it another day.			"

												Got four cars in less than an hour and they all feel about the same.  GT2 and GT3 on the playstation were so awesome they've ruined me from all other racing games out there so far.  Also, wtf is up with you starting out in a massively torquy RWD car for the first races when you're trying to get the feel for the physics in the game?  Stupid.  Start players out in an AWD or something and then go from there.			"

												Solid arcade racer in the flavour of Bizarre's old MSR/PGR games, works well with a g27 or xbox pad, highly recomended for some online fun with friends. Inclusion of split screen is a bonus, shame there isn't offline LAN play but I guess that's just the direction of things!I prefer this to Grid Autosport, lots of accessible fun and far easier to persuade non-racers to play!

												Original Grid was very hard for me, handling wise. But found this one just right for me. Game looks great. Driving feels good.DLC content seems too much spread over multiple DLC's, but I got Reloaded Edition during Summer Sale, so not much complaint about that. But still cars in 1 DLC, tracks in 1 DLC should would have made it much better. "
