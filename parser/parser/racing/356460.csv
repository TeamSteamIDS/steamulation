												This game is pretty crazy - you have to race more than one track at once, hopping between the tracks to control the cars. It shouldn't really work, but it does & how - it's a real rush to play.There's a ton of tracks too - i think 100 in campaign? - & it has a track creator & online multiplayer...Basically if you like arcade racing and smashing up cars with a crazy original mechanic I highly, highly recommend you get this game!

												Oh man. As someone who doesn't like braking in car games, Drive!Drive!Drive! is right up my alley because it's basically racing distilled into a sort of pure, core format and then multiplied upwards. Confusing, but pretty and fun.			"

												Fast, Furious, Manic, Addictive, Awesome!!  Racing on more than one track sounds insane and it is, absolutely love the concept as it takes the normal run of the mill racing concept to a new level - you have very quick fun but also have to think.  I'm a drummer and the soundtrack on this game is just so incredible, I will no doubt end up streaming the album of music it's from.  Once I had started playing I found it difficult to put down, the cars just get better and better in looks, speed and feel - and whoever created those tracks, wow - much more original than the normal realistic scenery we come to expect with Forza etc - which are also great driving games it has to be said.A great, pick up and just play game!

												The game features an array of events in the campaign mode with different victory conditions (position-only, points-based, object collection, and time trial). Progressing through the campaign unlocks new cars with slightly different stats. In addition, there is online multiplayer and the ability to create custom layouts and share them with others. The crux of the gameplay is managing several different one-lap races on mirrored tracks simultaneously. Because the AI drivers are terrible, you must switch between races to keep all of your drivers up from in each race. Controls are typical for an arcade racing game, with boost gained from drifting, jumping, and smashing other vehicles; the game is designed for a gamepad (there is no mouse support whatsoever, even for menus). The novel concept of Drive!Drive!Drive! is enough to make it stand out as an arcade racing title.

												Drive!Drive!Drive! is certainly a challenging yet fun game. There are some quirks that could be worked out (some probably dealing with my poor controller abilities).The game is fun, fast paced, and offers the unique challenge of jumping between multiple tracks during a race. You can't trust the computer too much so it's a balance. I do believe that the computer is a bit too stupid at times, as you may be far ahead, swap up a track and suddenly be yelling at the game. Not only is there a challenge but also multiplayer gamemodes and player-made tracks (though the interface to go through them could use some work- the list is just plain bad).My biggest annoyance: not being able to remap the controls. I keep trying to brake with X which ends up restarting the race completely. This could also be fixed by adding some sort of confirmation screen.All in all, I would recommend this game as a unique challenge.			"

												I have never played a game quite like DDD before. The fun that comes with way the game keeps you on your toes alone is enough to warrant a recommendation, but paired with an incredibly pleasing graphical style and a beautiful soundtrack, DDD is a must buy.			"

												I love the retro look of DRIVE!DRIVE!DRIVE! It feels so fresh but in the same time evokes happy memories from the neon arcades of the past. The game is very faced paced and highly addictive. You race low poly space cars across different galaxies over different tracks simultaneously  - what more can you ask for!			"

+ The gameplay is very unique. In each stage there are multiple seperate tracks that all have races going simultaneously. You must switch between cars on each track, and try to advance your position on each one to score enough points at the end. When you switch an AI will control your previous car for you, but obviously won't be as skillful as you.+ In my opinion, the driving feels very similar to Burnout. You have a boost meter, and to refill your Boost you need to slam into other cars, drift, or make high flying jumps. It is quite enjoyable to slam into a pack of cars and watch them go flying off the track. + Very challenging. As you may expect, participating in ~3 races at the same time can be quite difficult and at times frustrating. You get one of your cars to first place, switch to another, and before you know it your first car has fallen behind! Although I found it to be very fun even when not doing very well.+ Visually the game looks pretty good with a sort of minimalist cyberspace type style. I found it to be pretty interesting to see the polygon geometry of the track+ Online & cross platform multiplayer+ map editor+ Great soundtrack-  I would have liked to have seen some more interesting backgrounds / environments. They seem a bit plain			"

												Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers here to share my thoughts on my experience with a unique racing game called Drive!Drive!Drive! By Choice Publishing and Different Cloth. I received a copy of the game from our friends at Choice Publishing but as with all of my reviews, this has no effect on my experience.Drive!Drive!Drive is a unique racing game that takes inspiration from classic games like Wipeout or F-Zero. It uses its own engine called the Intelligent Stupidity Engine. As you might imagine, the game gets pretty crazy due to the other racers being quite dumb. However, the game prides itself in this insanity and it does make the game much more enjoyable.Although the game utilizes a more minimalist art style with lots of gray and lighter colors it is still quite pretty and the courses are very well designed. You’ll often see giant rocks floating in the sky or  rain/snow effects for the duration of the course. The lighting is also really good as well.There’re multiple modes for you to choose from including arcade and, my least favorite, collection. The initial campaign has 50 courses over 10 different planets but there is also a bonus campaign that features 50 more courses with increased difficulty along with a level editor to create your own courses to share with other players.The most unique part of this game is the way you play. Like most racing games you control one vehicle while the (rather stupid) AI controls the other vehicles.  Where this game differs, however, is that you race on multiple courses at once and to complete it, you must switch between the courses using the d-pad to take control of different vehicles. You need to time your switching well to keep your position so there is strategy involved. You can also boost to gain speed and drift around corners during a race as well. There are some courses that don’t have railings to prevent you from driving off the course so you need to be careful on harder courses.Overall, Drive!Drive!Drive is a game that I’m surprised isn’t more popular considering how fun it is to play and how absurd the game-play is. If you enjoy fast paced racing games or are looking for something new and unique to play in the racing genre I definitely recommend it. The ability to switch between multiple courses is really cool and it’s something that’s really fun to experience.Thanks a lot for taking the time to watch my videos and read this review folks. If you enjoyed them or found either of them helpful, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them. Also, be sure to subscribe to my channel for future videos!Happy gaming folks! - Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!			"

												At first, switching between tracks in the same race may feel weird and chaotic, but it turns out to be chaotic and fun !Easy to understand, there is some very nice ideas in the level design.Didn't played that much at the moment, but I will come back often on it !			"

												Drive! Drive! Drive! feels like a 3d RC-Pro Am minus the weapons.drifting is sublime,same with boosting.Switching takes some understanding to get used to. at first i hated it but its grown on me.Track designs get more sureal and hectic. really changes up the gameplay.The colors for the overall design is nice i just wish they were more vibrant.Music is one of my favorite parts of the game besides its sense of speed and destruction to other cars.Humor is also a nice bonus in the advice they give you.Totally recommended			"

												Triple D is a frantic racing game in which you (attempt) to race three cars simultaneously around a track. Races only last one lap, so you don’t have much time to get a car in the lead and then switch to another car. The tracks are designed so that gravity is relative to the track you’re racing on, but the tracks interlock at strange angles – but gravity is always ‘down’ relative to the track you’re currently racing on - if that makes any kind of sense. I haven’t had a chance to play multiplayer, but I can imagine it would be great for some post pub competitive racing.    "

												It's nice to see something different in the racing genre. The managing of multiple cars on multiple tracks means that this is a driving game where I have to concentrate again. This is a great driving game with which brings back memories of some of the greatest Amiga games.The physics and feel of the cars  is some where between outrun and stunt car racer. The visuals remind me of starglider II with a little Tron thrown in there as well. that combined with the cars inspired by some of the great poster cars from the 80's. "
