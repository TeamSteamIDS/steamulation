Early Access Review
								======================================EDIT: My original review was in March 2016, and after playing this game I did get into FPV, DEEEEEP... lol, and this sim really helped lock in important skills. I had another look today, and noticed a huge improvement in the tutorial, multiple pre-made quads and general polish across the board. I still can't dive the Hoover Dam, but give them time... Best FPV sim available!======================================This is coming from a hardcore gamer, looking to get into FPV drones because they look like fun,I am enjoying the sim, it seems like a great way to learn how to fly before destroying an actual drone, and I could see it being a fantastic skill improving tool even when flying actual drones regularly. I just have a few things that need mentioning if this game is to be the ""gateway drug"" for gamers becoming FPV pilots, and surely that thought has crossed the devs minds.Firstly, that tutorial is brutal. Maybe coming from a RC background it would be easier, but having never flown a quad-copter before, being put in a box with one window to exit from is the equivalent of learning to pick locks by handcuffing yourself underwater. A typical gamer will need at least half hour in a large open space, preferably with a guide and controller indications explaining how the drone works by performing simple maneuvers ie ""Take off, hover  at same altitude for 10 seconds"" ""Now fly forwards and backwards maintaining altitude"" etc until the basics are natural.Next up, there really needs to be some sort of pre-made drones that handle differently for different levels of skill. Begin with a slow and sluggish drone that is forgiving and easy to fly, then work your way up as your skills improve. I know there is a workshop where I can edit my drone, and options to set motor speeds etc. but these should really be options I fiddle with after I have learned what is what, not while I am struggling to stay horizontal as I smash into another hay bale.Speaking of hay bales. The maps. Seriously, I could be flying anywhere in the world, but here I am in some unbelievably dull locations. I am sure more maps are on the way, but even for RC enthusiasts this can't make much sense. Here are a few map ideas I would be excited to see in the final release:Boat (sinking titanic?)Music festival (maybe Woodstock?)Theme ParkHot Air balloon Show. (Take off from one balloon, and there are 30 others just floating about)Construction tower.Literally ANYWHERE! I understand that this is trying to be realistic, but a game like this also gives you the ability to do things you wouldn't usually be able to do, like fly in public areas full of people, or dangerous locations, and the lines required the fly for racing could be a lot more interesting than markers on the ground, like ducking behind a waterfall to emerge near a roller coaster track, which you must follow for while before shooting into a ghost train tunnel. Gimmicky? Yes, but if just a couple of unrealistic tracks were included, it would be a lot of fun.TL;DR I am enjoying the game, and hope to see it become more approachable, without losing it's realistic simulation edge. I recommend for anyone interested in FPV drone racing.If you're curious how deep I dove into the world of FPV check out this clip

								I love this game.     A friend started flying quadcopters and quickly pulled me into the hobby.  I had flown a toy grade Quad two or three times and realized quickly that it wasn't as intuitive as I thought and it was going to take a lot of crashing, buying parts, repairing and crashing again just to begin to grasp the fundamentals. Afterwards my friend introduced me to Liftoff. I was intrigued because it was radically different from actually flying the toy grade drone.  After spending a few days figuring out what radio controller was right for me I ordered one and immediately got Liftoff.      I played with an XBOX 360 controller untill the RC controller arrived. Playing with the XBOX controller is definately not going to allow you to experience the full greatness of the game but I was thrilled to have the option since I was waiting for the RC controller. When it arrived it made playing the game WAY more enjoyable but, the first few hours were miserable. I kept trying and finally I was able to complete a lap, then a race and then things fell together and the game became incredibly rewarding. Not only is the game tremendous fun to play but I eventually realized that awful learning curve was really Liftoff teaching me how to use a radio transmitter. About a month later (about 20 hrs of playing Liftoff) I built my first FPV racing drone and although I've had more than my share of crashes, I can honesty say that Liftoff may have saved me hundreds of dollars and hours of tedious repairs. It gave me a big head start on actual FPV racing.     If you're interested in learning to fly quads then you should do yourself a huge favor and hold off on the expensive quad, get Liftoff and a controller first. Learn to fly in Liftoff, then go fly the drone, you'll be glad you did. I also tried FPV Freerider and while it was fun to play it just didn't seem to replicate the actual flying experience as realistically. The drones in Liftoff feel real, plus, with the update there's new quads and propellers and a plethora of other new parts to play with in the Workbench. I love mixing and matching components and seeing how it effects flight characteristics. The workshop has a number of really great tracks available too.  The various drone options in conjunction with all the maps available really extend the game immeasurably. (Side note: the track creator seems a little cumbersome to use)     Knowing now how much fun the game is,  I would fork over the cash for a RC transmitter and this game even If i had no intention of ever actually controlling a real drone. (Kinda like buying a wheel and/or pedals for a car racing game.)			"

								No issues downloading and installing from Steam the afternoon it was released.  Try all the menus and options.  No issues at this point.  Got a little sim time, and I am no expert in flying.  The options of FPV noise is nice.  The graphics are awesome.  No major issues.  Looking to hook up Spektrum controller later.  Used xBox controller with no issues.  Nice Early Access - I will provide more details as I play more.  #crashatnoexpenseEdit 11/12Got over three hours in the game, and I love it.  I was able to hook up my Dx7s with the helpful discussion post.  I have gained a bit more confidence and even toyed with Acro mode.  The first update was a big difference.  This game is showing great potential and look forward it!			"

								Still very much an Early Access experience, but it's shaping up nicely. It's already a ton of fun to play and good practice for the real thing. The graphics are locations are especially impressive, and the workbench aspect adds a lot to the experience.The things I would like to see prioritized moving forward are continuing to tweak the physics and adding at least a simple lap timer (ala freerider) so that it is more useful for training, even before the racing aspect is available.Overall, a great sim with lots of potential that is definitely recommended at this price.

								I have flown in a few different multi-rotor sims and this one is, by far, my favorite. It's not 100% like the real thing, but it's certainly close enough to bring my skills up and make me way more confident on the controls. Learning with a sim is like learning to ride a bike with training wheels. Until you get out there and fly on the real sticks you can't hope to compete. However, this is a great tool to get your confidence up and make you more comfortable for when you do get your hands on the sticks. I've been using this sim for a while now and I'm certainly learning more and more. Each time I fly my quad I'm more and more confident and that's come way faster than just flying once a week for a few packs thanks to this sim. There's never a substitute for the real thing, but this is certainly something to help get your there and even help sharpen your skills when you get there.			"

								So, where to start?I'm currently sitting on 290 hours on Liftoff and continue to play it every day I can. There are a couple of ways you can approach Liftoff.. as a game, or a tool to use for practicing for real life flight. If you know you are serious about getting into this hobby, I strongly suggest taking the approach of treating it like a training tool. For example, like just about any other skill you can learn, its recommended that you get 1 hour of practice every day to improve your skills as much as possible. That's pretty much how I decided to approach Liftoff, which can even sometimes mean forcing myself to spend a bit flying around even if I don't want to... I know that sounds kind of silly when its simply a video game, but it's definitely payed off. I started playing Liftoff back at the start of the year, and flew in real life for the first time in July and was able to fly acro on my second flight. I'm not saying that to show off, but to show how amazing Liftoff has been for making it so someone can just go out IRL and be comfortable flying a drone at nearly 100km/h (60MPH) without even needing to leave the house.If you are in the category of being interested in FPV but you're not too sure, I'd suggest just buying a cheap transmitter, or even use an xbox controller with a rubber band on the left stick holding it downwards like I first did and see how you are feeling at about the 20 hour mark. That may sound like a lot for just testing a game but you really need to give it a chance until you are able to get your finger coordination down and can start feeling a bit more smooth with your flight.If at any point something ""clicks"" and you realize how much you love it, I'd say start saving as much as you can for a taranis transmitter, or just go out and buy one if you can afford it. This will probably be the best investment you'll make getting into this hobby as you'll be able to use it down the track when you start flying IRL.I don't want to make this too long, so in summary, Liftoff is most likely one of the best investments I have ever made in my life just because of how much money it's saved me. If I had gone out and gotten to the level of flying I'm at now by just flying IRL, then I have no doubt I'd be about 5-10,000 dollars short by now. If I were to add up the costs of the crashes I've had in Liftoff, it would literally be hundreds of thousands of dollars worth.. so if you have seen some FPV videos on youtube, and you are interested I really doubt you'll regret making this purchase.and finally, thanks LugasStudios for this great piece of software. <3Lots of love,Lonnopo			"

Early Access Review
								First, I do have some credentials to mention, perhaps to add some validity to the review.  I served 6 years in the Air Force and while stationed in Italy in 1976, I joined a group of Italian hang glider pilots I found while driving in nearby mountains.  I bought a hang glider, flew 5 times from a 2500 foot peak, and then crashed and broke my arm. The military took care of me, and I'm okay.  Years later, I discovered flight simulators on an Apple II computer (SubLogic FS2). I've used simulators ever since then to an exhaustive degree.  In 2004 I had the means to start flight lessons, and obtained a Private Pilot license in 2006.  I put about 80 hours in command of rental planes (Cessna 150, 152, 170, 172M, 172P) and then got training in a Weight-Shift Control sport aircraft.(commonly called a trike) and then I bought one, N502PW.  I flew 100 hours in the trike over the next 5 years, then sold the aircraft in 2014. I have a Phantom 3 Standard quadcopter, a Spedix 275 FPV racing drone, a Vortex 250 FPV racing drone, a Blade NanoQX FPV mini, a Blade InductrixFPV, and an FPV Tiny Whoop I made from an Inductrix.  My FPV videos are on YouTube at patjoyce7323.Liftoff is one of the most remarkable simulator products I have ever used.  It has the closest feel to the actual experience of controlling an FPV drone.  There are no ""anomolies"" or odd glitches when you use the controls aggressively.  The most remarkable thing about LIFTOFF is the support from Steam and the Steam Community.  I bought the software for only $20 (compare to MS flight simulator $60+ ) and was able to use my really old ""Real Flight"" USB controller from 20 years ago!  That controller is not always compatible with other simulators, but works great in Liftoff.  But again, the greatest thing, is how LIFTOFF has been IMPROVED since I installed and started using it.  LIFTOFF has amazing graphics.  Other simulators cut back a bit on the realism and the details, so that they can build a more expansive landscape filled with all of the actual structures that are there in the real world.  Liftoff is so designed to get the best balance of landscape detail (3d objects) and computer performance.  You can customize the complexity of the graphics displayed so that you can increase the frame rate of the simulation.  The physics are completely accurate.  You can build a new quad completely from scratch and save it.  You can select parts such as frames, motors, props, batteries, antennas, etc.  You can adjust the FPV camera angle, add a Mobius or GoPro on top, then go fly your customized quadcopter.Back to the landscapes.  There are many environments provided for you to fly.  Each one is very different from the others.  The first ""Straw Bale Field"" is wide open space with no trees (except for a few outside the fence).  The bales of hay provide a clear ground reference.  The next environment has tall pine trees so you can learn obstacle avoidance and more advanced maneuvers.  The next is flying inside one level of a parking garage to teach you to manage your altitude carefully.  There were several more beautiful environments (a pro football stadium, for example) but here is the beauty of all this... they keep giving you more environments as they are developed.  And the latest one, called Hannover, is like the bando heaven we all seek.  No people, just awesome open places to fly and hone your skills.  The windows have reflections, and the level of detail is as good as it gets. There are lots of areas filled with trees, different sizes, types and colors, with gaps both big and small, and not always predictable, to challenge your flying skills.I have not ever used the Multiplayer feature, or competed in races, all of which I am sure are worlds in and of themselves, with a huge number of tracks available for download.  LIFTOFF has a builder feature which allows you to build your own track in any of the environments.  Tracks can be saved and shared.  I've build a few tracks, and honestly, it takes a while to learn how to move and place the flags, gates, and markers, but in the end, you have a really nice race track that is exactly what you need.  Then you go fly your own track, and since you can edit tracks, you can always come back later to make improvements and adjustments. In short, this simulator will make you a better pilot.  And it accurately portrays the experience of performing FPV quadcopter flying.  If you like the DRL product, you will enjoy LIFTOFF even more.  Worth it at twice the price.			"

								Like others, I see a ton of potential in this game.  I got a racing drone for Christmas, and of course I need plenty of practice due to the speed that these things can move out.  I've only spent 2 hours in liftoff, and I already feel like my skill level has improved significantly.  I've got much appreciation for those pilots that can fly in acro mode all the time :)			"

								Edited 12/16/2015: We've had pretty great communication with the DEVS and community members using the Discussions forums as well as the in-game error reporting features. Several users have expressed issues with Transmitters not calibrating correctly or at all with the software.  If you have an RC Transmitter, there are a few guides already posted and several discussions with topics discussing how we've worked through some of those matters - but there are ultimately a LOT of cables and variances in how they're produces, and even more Transmitters that users have. If you're  having errors connected, post it and let's get you flying!  I personally have a Spektrum DX6, DX6i, Taranis Plus, and Turnigy 9x and all work well using a USB cable. The Spektrum devices took several calibration attempts, and then additional Sub-Trim manipulation, but work well after.* * * * * * * *All around - I am really excited to see how they progress with this game. The 3 current levels are already beautiful and the multiplayer is going to be very exciting. Two thumbs up! (Then back to the joysticks!)Note: While this game does work decently with 360 or similar gaming controller, I do not recommend spending time to get used to it. Gaming joysticks are meant to center themselves when you release pressure. This is ideal for most game situations, but not with throttle. While I did use the 360 controller for the tutorial and first test level, and it was decent enough, once got my Spektrum transmitter connected to the game and calibrated - it was a night and day difference. Much easier flight, it was much more fun and it was much smoother feedback from the camera also as you won't be bobbing up and down.This will be a must have for pilots that want the FPV experience without ruining their setups or going through tons of props in the early learning stages. Would also be great for teaching purposes.I have Real Flight, Phoenix RC and FMS Flight Sim that I have been using all three for quite some time. For a game delving into the FPV realm digitally - my first impression after 45 minutes of play: This is going to be amazing!!			"

The physics in this game are just not right. The copter is way too floaty. It feels like gravity has been dialed down to 80% or something. Even with the props idle, the copter takes way too long to fall to earth. Doing sharp turns around flags, the copter slides as if it was weightless.The collision model encourages bad habits. You can't just fly through a tree canopy in real life and keep going. Props do not take damage and then ""heal up"". They either break, and you crash, or they don't break.This is an okay video game, but it is a bad simulator. I can't recommend this game at this time (0.2.2) for learning to fly. It will not teach you what it actually feels like to pilot a quadcopter.			"

								First off i was one of the first people to purchase this and start playing endless hours on it, shredding and searching for whaetever i could find from bugs to glitches. From the getgo there was only very minor issues (none with gameplay) and was able to hook up to my Spekrum DX8 and play right away. I enjoyed every second of it and can't wait for it to be a full blown release with all features. I recommend this for beginner pilots, pros, and even experts to hone their skills. Graphics are great and the video noise is super immersive. Hook your goggles into the game and it's like you're at the field. I've spent well over 49 hours to date on this game and love it even more with every update.You can choose all your parts, set your sensitivity, tune all your PIDs and everything else that goes along with miniquad racing. This is not just a game, it's a training sim, a learning tool, and more! If you have never picked up a rc remote or if there's one glued to your hands 24/7, it doesn't matter, i still recommend this game hands down. love it!			"

								As a non-FPVer I bought this game out of curiosity, for fun. And fun is what I got. A lot of it. At first I had no clue on how to control the drone and the tutorial is a mess, however, I've managed to fly forward and backwards. Soon after, I learned how to strafe, to rotate and to land. With this basic knowledge I gained in 15 minutes, I was able to dramatically increase my knowledge in a few hours.Now I informed myself about FPV and thinking about getting into it in real life. I'm wondering if playing this game is helping me later on, but so far it didn't hurt I guess. And I bought this for the fun at first, and this minimum I got from the very first hour.			"

The customizable controls allow for complete control over my drone, besides that setting it up is very easy. I like the playable maps and I'm excited to see what's coming in the future!  The trackbuilder makes it easy to build my own tracks in a fun and easy way. This feature makes it easy for me to push my skills and train on making sharper corners.Thumbs up for the team who made this happen, I'm looking forward to patches in the future!			"

								Plays well, looks good and is definitely helping my flying. I loosen up on the controls when its not a rl drone at risk so can really get into the zone. Probably some finer points to refine in the sim but as a novice its great practice.Installed, plugged in my 9 year old E-sky USB controller, easily configured 4 channels on first launch and I was flying in less than 5 minutes. 4 great locations so far and a workbench lets you add and adjust a selection of popular motors, props, batteries, etc. so you can closely replicate what you have at home or experiment with different configurations.As its Beta I'm sure more content/refinement will be added, but even as it stands, 10/10 would buy again.

								I dont have any experience in FPV flying before playing this simulator and basically as noob as a person can get.After fiddling around with the settings and just practicing my♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this sim i eventually get better at it.Once i felt confident enough, i eventually bought a real life racing drone and from my experience, the skills you learned from the simulator do transfer over to real life. Maybe about 80% of it because the performance of the quadcopter in-game is way better than the entry level quadcopter i bought. The physics feel good enough, but still any simulator cannot fully emulate real life physics. If you are a new FPV pilot looking to try out this hobby, I highly recommend you put some stick time into this simulator before trying it out in real life. If you are a seasoned pro FPV pilot, I also suggest getting this because it is a good tool to practice your skills between charges or if the weather doesn't permit you to fly.Thats all for my review, have fun and fly safe!

								Definitely, nothing is 100% accurate and close to reality as reality itself. However, this game is really close to it, gravity needs a little more effectiveness, at the time it feels like the drone floats a bit too much, but I know the guys at LuGus will eventually implement it perfectly. The game is a great tool for practicing without obliterating your wallet in props and other gear that would otherwise get damaged in accidents in real life flying. I love it, and I'm very much looking forward to the next updates with hopefully more tracks and awesome extra content. Amazing job, I'm veeeeery happy with it. FWIW, I'm flying with a RadioLink AT9, using the PengFei USB dongle set on AeroFly, I used manual preset creation to configure it, not a single issue. Power up and connect your transmitter to the PC before opening Liftoff for best results.			"

								I was hesitant to buy this game, with the other large FPV sims filling my needs. This is absoluetely excellent. I appreciate the involvement the team appears to have within the steam community page, there is a lot of potential within this games platform.  This may be one of the few games I would buy DLC for if they were able to include brand specific drones with fairly exact physics.  I've seen some discouraging talk on the forums about the work this team has done, but this game is so far above and beyond anything else on the market.  This is early access and the game I am the most excited for.   Kudos to the team working on this, expand the tools for customization and continue to build your platform.The best $20 I've spent on steam in a long time.			"

								Really enjoying the game so far! I fly quads already but I'm trying to learn how to fly more aggressive racer quads. This game is helping me learn to fly with the tilted camera and with more power than I'm used to. The devs are very quick to fix any kind of problems and have improved the physics much since launch.The physics overall feel pretty solid. It would be nice to see some wind or other factors that make the quad feel a little less on rails. It's not bad at all, though. Flying in the game feels pretty similar to real life.I'm using the Taranis controller. Quick note: the game doesn't take negative inputs from the taranis, so make a new model, modify the curves to only be 50, and offset by 50. This means your left roll, for example, is really at what is normally the centerpoint (0) and your right roll is what is normally full right (100). You'll have to do this for all channels. In the guides section there's pre-made model files.			"

								Great FPV Racing Simulator!I'm looking forward to see the continued development of this simulator, it's improving alot for every version. The latest version has done a lot the the flight feeling, expecially low/zero-throttle steering. The inbuilt trackbuilder is a great feature.  Check out the track i built yesterday!

+ A Fantastic tool for beginner or expert drone flying to learn how to fly, and to also have a practice environment to avoid wrecking their expensive drone in person. (which tends to happen very often with unexperienced drone flyers)+ The gameplay feels pretty realistic, and also comes with a bit of a learning curve which makes flying both challenging yet rewarding. + The various obstacle courses / races are great challenges to test your skill.+ Workshop support for custom created tracks+ You can custimize your drone with various parts+ Great soundtrack  (Allows you import your own custom playlist as well!)This game is in Early Access so these are subject to change- Needs a slightly improved tutorial to explain some of the additional controls which solved a lot of issues I had with the game in the video shown above.You can remove the camera noise by pressing ""C"", theres more cool options ""A"" will give you ACRO mode, and ""V"" will give you 3rd person camera. You can also change your camera angle in the workbench and last but not least, you can upload your own music in the game.﻿Here is a follow up video which shows what I missed previously:

								Drones became popular in the last 2 years, now a days is not hard to find a person who has a Quadcopter, but is hard to find a person that do not crash the machine in the first flight .THIS SIMULATOR IS FOR RACING QUADS, IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER KIND OF DRONE WITH GPS AND A LOT OF STUFF THIS SIMULATOR IS NOT FOR YOU. However if you are starting in drone ""race"" this sim will help and save a lot of your time and money.I had never piloted fpv drones, and with 7 hours in this sim i felt (i felt that i was mr. steele, just joking) that i could fly without any problem, and i was right, 1º flight was clean and soft, without crash and dumb skill.In portuguese:Drones se tornaram populares no ultimos 2 anos, hoje em dia não é dificil encontrar pessoas com esses equipamentos, mas é dificil achar alguem que não tenha quebrado a maquina no primeiro voo.ESSE SIMULADOR É SOMENTE PARA DRONES DE CORRIDA, SE VOCÊ TEM OUTRO TIPO DE DRONE COM GPS E OUTRAS COIISAS ESSE SIMULADOR NÂO È PARA VOCÊ. Contudo, se voce está iniciando no drone race esse simulador é perfeito, ira poupar-te muito dinheiro e tempo (Principalmente no Brasil, onde os esquipamentos custam 5x o preço lá de fora).Eu nunca tinha pilotado drone em fpv, em 7 horas no simulador eu já me sentia pronto, meu primeiro voo foi realizado com sucesso, sem quebrar nada.

								Great basis for an ace sim - Will help you learn acro and save you $£ on broken gear. Loving it so far.Pros - Pretty realistic - Features awesome quads (I'm bias as I have a Vortex) - Allows you to mess with FPV camera settings easily, I'd never tried altering the angle IRL, but I feel much more confident to do it now. - Production value is great, there's obviously a few bugs but alot of work has gone into this. - Works with taranis (Although a little fiddly to setup)Cons - Still got a little way to go to be worth that price point. Still requires working race mode. - Limited levels - Tutorial is terrible. I can fly pretty well I think and that tutorial makes me feel like an idiot so god knows how new ""pilots"" will feel - When you crash it takes a little while to get back to flying. Make it instant!! - Bugs - Odd crash, sound comes and goes, nothing too bad.			"

								OK time to edit...First off I wanna say it's just amazing that LuGus managed to fix almost all of the problems that stopped me from loving this Game in just one day!!! Great job you've done there guys!!!At first I wasn't able to map controls to my DX6i, what turned out to be my own fault in the end. But I was really impressed how well you could actually fly this thing with such a piece of crap of a controller like my totally worn out 5 years old 360 gamepad. This was already so much fun that I flew quite a while without worrying about setting up my DX6i properly.When I finally tried with a real rc transmitter I was blown away how great this sim handles and how much fun it is. Compared to yesterday it's a completely different experience!I was happy to see that it's possible now to turn off the OSD but couldn't find an option for changing the camera angle. But I#m confident this will be implemented soon.The flight model feels good and kind of natural, but still is too easy compared to the real thing. I was able to pull off some maneuvers that would have had me crashed in real life. The quad also is not as ""snappy"" as I like it and PID tuning feels still a bit weird but again... I'm confident this will be fixed in the future.So all in all this is a must have for anyone interested or already involved in FPV Racing!!!Old Review from yesterday:At this point I cannot recommend this game for people who fly real fpv racequads...Looks like a good start to me, but a few things annoy the hell out of me and will make me stick with hotprops for now:- the hover point is way below stick center and cannot be adjusted. (Tested this on my old DX4e, my DX6i and my 360 Gamepad - Hover point is at around 25% throttle) I prefer a hover point at the stick center and afaik that's how most people fly- feels like zero throttle in fact isn't zero throttle... quad falls way too slow compared to real life experience- camera angle cannot be adjusted- no way to turn off the OSD ... I prefer flying without OSDThese are all things I'm sure will be fixed soon and besides those the flight model feels promising but needs more fine tuning and more real life feeling (for example jittering when decending into own propwash). There are quite a few sims out there that come near the feeling of piloting a fpv racequad and I really hope this one will come close or even spot on.Time will tell(this review will be updated once liftoff gets better)			"

								I cut my teeth on a very popular RC flight sim and it taught me so much about flying airplanes and helis. Liftoff has already surpassed the other sim for quadcopter physics. Even though it is in early access and is very short of it's eventual goal it is a strong tool for honing quad skills. I have 50 + hours in this sim and being winter where I am I feel my learning is progressing very rapidly. I feel like my second summer flying quads will be very fulfilling having a better sense of control thanks to this sim. The developers are very interested in user input and come through with regular updates. I am very excited for the future of this sim. Highly recommend for anyone interested in multirotor flight!Update!I just crossed the 300 hour mark with Liftoff. I started flying quads mid summer 2015 and only flew in level mode. Even though I used that mode I still had crashes. I spent some of the winter flying Liftoff in acro mode and improved to a great degree in that time. I have had quite a few flights this summer and only fly acro (Take off, flight, and Landing), and I now fly as if I have been flying for much longer than 1 and a half seasons. I have made many Liftoff videos to demonstrate it's power as a learning tool.I can attest, after spending so much time in the sim, that anyone having a problem with this simulator is falling victim to either their own ignorance or outdated hardware. To speak to the later I feel that hardware non-upgraders are the bain of all gamers. If you are on an old laptop or a weak one for that matter you should naturally expect to have issues with games not working correctly. Upgrade or die! Seriously if you are one of these people realize you are holding us all beack. Please stop crying about games not working on your decrepit outdated machines. To the former; Why review a game poorly before you exhaust all efforts to learn the customizations? Sims always throw arcaders off. Just because you can't fly easily right off the bat doesn't mean it's broken. It means you currently lack the skill required to keep it in the air. This is remedied one of two ways. 1. Spend time learning to tune the aircraft by a. watching videos from people that have put in the work to help people such as yourself. b. experimenting a while reserving judgment until you figure things out. 2. Un-install the sim and go find something arcadish and easier made for people just like you.  Also why is it that some people forget the simple fact that this is an EARLY RELEASE title? Common sense dictates that it won't be perfect and that it is still under development. Updates for this and all other early access titles can sometimes have negitive affects. Be prepared for that. New resources for liftoff are added at a more than acceptable rate IMO. Further more the developers respond to questions in quick fasion. This sim/game is living up to it's potential in all areas, improving all the time. To any prospective buyer please note that you will need some sort of a game controller to fly Liftoff. A keyboard will not work. Seems obvious but... To get the best experience a interlink radio that comes with realflight or a game commander that comes with aerofly can be used and the buttons and switches can be used to switch modes or reset the aircraft. The gimbals aren't the best but this will provide the most in-game support of functions. The Sim supports field radios (remote controllers for real world aircraft) The easiest and best of these is the Taranis X9D/plus. This radio has a mini usb port on the back that makes it a perfect option for this and other sims like it. Liftoff has a preset for this controller as well. Even though it is perfect for the sim you will need to program the radio to work correctly. There is a guide for this and many other radios. That said not all radios play nice and there is nothing the developer can really do about that. I own all the other quad racing sims out there and this hands down is the best and the other sims are complete products not under development. If you are thinking about buying Liftoff and especially if you want to use it to improve your real world flying I say buy it. You will not be disappointed as long as you are not under any misconceptions and are willing to spend time with it.			"

And if multiplayer will be available, then this game can grow out to be a big online game as well!			"

								Liftoff, the best simulator for action quadcopter racing. 5 Arenas you can choose to fly around in. There are race tracks set up that you can blast through in Self level or Acro mode (toggled by pressing the A key).  There isnt much choice in the way of Quads to choose from, but in FPV mode it makes almost no difference what frame you use.  The motor, prop, battery selection in the workbench is very good. Lobster motors, quiet clever. I love God mode, changing props, batteries etc is for Actual reality, dispencing that chore triples your play time.The physics are right on the money for my experience.  I have always used self level mode (comming from a Photography/Phantom background)  and I would almost never used full throttle but spending 10 hours on this in Acro mode and full throttle upto 60% of the time..... and I dont think I will go back to self level on mini quads, except maybe in the carpark level, thats pretty enclosed for me at the moment.I have my graphics set to HD and on Good (on a laptop). It is smooth enough to weave around on the forest level at speed, the depth of field is sufficent to pick a good line through the trees.Lift off is handly learning tool or something to help you get a flying fix on a rainy weekend.I found it was alittle trick to set up my controller but there is a tonne of videos on how to get it going, so a bit of paitence goes along way.You can use you own music where you kind of load it into Steam. It wasnt as easy as it could be but I did get a couple of tracks working so I could get in my ""Zone"".Is it worth the money, well yes.  They have made a couple of updates which included an extra track, which is something you would have to pay extra for on a small mobile device. I have read they are activley working on multi player which would be pretty fun.  And it means you can fly with a bunch of friends with out all of you having to by expensive Base stations and those low wattage VTx's.What I would like to see is Eagle mode.  Where you have to pitch your flying skills against Natures finest...  But then maybe the Dutch police would ban that. "

								As far as dedicated drone simulation goes, this is the top level. Eveything is accounted for both in and out of the simulator in terms of setup support and guides. If You feel You do not need a guide, You can jump right in and fly. I prefer to fly FPV without stabilization help. This models that feeling of freedom on the edge of losing control convincingly. Each drone has it's differences in handling. You can create Your own drone and places to fly them. I reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a dedicated drone simulation platform for professional level training. I also recommend this to all flight enthusiasts due to the physics and the appreciation You will have for them. I also recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a drone as this will reenforce what You learn in the field and vice versa.

								Best Quadcopter Simulator out there! I tried multiple games with quadcopters, and this one takes the cake. It really feals like you are flying in fov. They even added static (that's effected by range) to make it feal realistic. I usually set the games resolution to 800 x 600. becuase that is my goggles/camera resolution. This game beats Aerofly a 100$ program. Aerofly is still fun with its various ships to fly, but if you want to learn acro quadcopters then this is the program for you!Pros*Great Graphics*Fun Levels*Great customization options to match real quads*Level editor*Realistic FOV*When ever you Complete a lap. You can race/watch your last flight.*Multiplayer!*Steam Workshop Share able contentCons*Only quad copters are flyable in the game*I wish there is a Large map. such as a entire island maybe 10 times larger then any current map. Just for Open world Free roam, and add mountains for cliff diving (that would be amazing).*The levels boundary seams to small. i want a map that has a lot higher sky boundary for large flips. (relates to last con)Again Amazing game. I can't wait to see what the devs do to improve the game over time. I only have a few hours in the game, and i already learned a lot. i feal a lot more confident in my acro skills. can't wait to take these skill out on the field with my quad!			"

								I am as new as it gets to flying quads. I am going do my best to try and get into some racing - the FPV stuff. But as we all know the fast toys aren't neccessrily the cheapest. So I figured I had better get my feet wet with some sim time before even attempting the real thing. Smart choice for me! lolDidn't care to get some sim that was gonna try and cover ever form of flying - you know planes and all. Just some dedicated  sim for the quads kind. One where all efforts were single focused. Not one half-a__ed in all fields - but a killer in one.I like Steam and after some surfing around and see all the other sims and the half-hearted reviews. One kept poking it's head out by some few as to how great liftoff is.Went to Steam and bought. Been giggling ever since! Did some 360 controller hook-up and got my feet wet. I could see the tremendous effort hiding behind an inappropriate controller. A simulator just dying to be set free! The 360 controller is great for a lot of games. But one thing that become obvious really guick was the fact that it isn't configured right for real world flight. When you go thru the calibrating stage to run a controller that isn't a preloaded configuration, I found a major flaw with these controllers.The little joy sticks don't travel in a ""square box"" perimeter pattern when you have to rotate them thru there full throw calibration. What I mean is that in a real flying situation and you have full left yaw and you want to keep that input and then throw full throttle at the same time (mode two throttle with yaw on the same left stick) when you push the little stick up for the full throttle it will end up moving to the right ( back to the middle) on the yaw axis to get to full throttle! That sucks! Not a ""real world"" condition. So the controller takes away a whole lot of these people's hard work when they created this really great simulator and the new pilot learns how to fly with some really crumby technique!Now I want to get something like a Taranis grade transmitter. But i couldn't see spending a couple hundred on a transmitter that might get outdated by a new model by the time I learned to fly! Shopped around and took a gamble on a ""USB RC Flight Simulator RC Tech 6chn"" controller. UPS just delivered it today. So I plugged in and went caibrating with liftoff. Sure 'nuf the ""square"" pattern of sticks on the controller is what brought Liftoff to life! Let me tell you - talk about making you feel like what the real quad must feel like! If not it has to be so close that what ever difference there must be will be but an extremely small little hickup to learn in the actual flying.Now I am pretty sure I don't have reverse throttle - but that can be fingered out at a latter date with maybe the help  of some serious tech guy. But this little cheap controller and this great Liftoff Simulator you can be come, I'm sure, a very competant pilot. Be able to strap on a real one and fly the first time out without digging a million postholes or chopping concrete up with an expensive quad. And probably at real close to racing speeds and manuveralbility.So people go get the real controller and this Liftoff! Highly, highly recommended quad simulator - this thing rocks!!!! C ya @ the races!			"

Pros and Cons to this game are as listed:ProsGreat Flight Sim for Drone RacingGreat Community for AddonsAllows for Custom PlaylistGreat Graphics and ability to Turn on or off Noise (Noise being grainy quality of camera) on CameraConsHas Certain Flight Height Limits (I know this is supposed to go along with FAA guidelines or limitations of Unreal)Free Flight is Limited (Certain Heights and Fly Distance)Customization is Also LimitedOther than these Cons this is a beyond fantastic game and it is just getting better! I would totally recommend this game to people looking to get into this hobby or just looking for an alternative to other simulators. "

								Maybe it was the rain outside that prompted me to Early Access this game, but I'm sure glad I did! Since I usually build my own 250 Racers it was nice for a change to see how a Vortex Pro handles in comparison, its was also pretty cool to see Ummagawd and Metal Danny's setups! Even though its in Early Access, it seems pretty polished. Graphics are well done, physics are pretty real and handling seems pretty near the real thing. The only thing is that I hope they add more frame types. All in all perfect 5/7 and I can't wait to see the full release! I think this game could be a big hit amoungst us enthusiasts and its a perfect start for anyone getting into the hobby. 20 bucks is far better than countless sets of shattered props, dented motors, and cracked carbon fiber frame builds that can get quite expensive.

								I'm very new to the FPV racing drone scene. Flying a FPV racing drone is a daunting task and learning how to fly one is no mean feat. After a decent amount of time with Liftoff I can safely say I'm still not good at it. But I keep improving at a steady pace thanks to some quality tutorials and a decent amount of levels to choose from that vary in difficulty. Minus 2, for instance, is particularly brutal. I feel like I still have loads of stuff I need to tackle in Liftoff such as custom tracks, multiplayer racing and different drone setups (I don't feel like I'm quite ready yet to dive into that deep end). The dev team seems to be churning out updates at a consistent pace, which adds to the overal package.Flying an FPV racing is still a daunting task, but somehow, Liftoff makes it seem manageable and makes me eager to learn more. Thinking about the amount of money I have saved by crashing all these drones into a virtual concrete pillar instead of a real one, really justifies the purchase.			"

								Before I ever got a real quad, I bought a Taranis to practice in simulators. This was easily the best decision I made. I initially started with this simulator, but it was too laggy to be any good, so I spent a solid 30 hours on Hotprops. Now that I have 6 months of real life FPV under my belt, I've found myself coming back to this sim. First of all, the physics are great. Being able to tweak so much in the flight controller settings has allowed me to set up my virtual quad pretty darn close to my Xhover Element. The only big problem I've noticed is that the sim can feel a bit too floaty, like any bit of throttle you give will keep you in the air much better than in the real world. Adjusting the throttle curve fixes this. The graphics aren't terrible, and I feel like the sim has gotten much smoother over time. I'm running it on my iMac and find that 720p graphics work the best. I also like the ability to play with FPV noise. It's not exactly like experiencing real breakup in your video feed, but it does the job pretty well. My biggest grip with the graphics is the way the trees appear. If you're flying fast at all, you'll find that they sort of just materialize right in front of you, making it hard to avoid wrecking on branches or shredding your props on leaves. With the more recent updates, you now have a whole bunch of frames to choose from. I'm really excited about this, although I can't say I feel a huge difference in the way the frames fly. As long as your motors, battery, and props are the same, the frames fly pretty much exactly alike, with the obvious exception of the much smaller frames that can only run 4"" or smaller props. So, what would I change? First of all, the crash physics are pretty bad. This isn't a huge deal, but there's something amusing about crashes with real life quads. One minute you're flying along fine, the next you're tumbling and bouncing across the ground. In the sim, you sort of hit the ground and slide, which isn't realistic at all. Next up, I would love to see some 5x4x3 props. The ""Propfan"" 5030x3 do a decent job of simulating the HQ 5x4x3's that I fly in real life, but they're definitely not the same. A proper 5"" tri blade with a little more bite in the air would be awesome. Next up, some larger areas to fly in would be fun. I'm not much of a racer, instead I do primarily freestyle flying. Levels like the Hangar are so much fun because of the vertical structures, so I would like to see more stuff like that. Maybe even a more urban environment like an abandoned factory or office park? The biggest thing I would change is the FPV camera lens option. First, I would move it to the workbench screen instead of in the settings screen. Next, I would add a 2.5mm option. I, like a lot of people, fly in real life with a GoPro lens on my HS1177 camera, which provides a superior field of view without the annoying fisheye effect that a 2.1mm lens has. All that being said, I highly recommend this simulator. It's a great way to knock the rust off if you haven't flown in a while, or to teach somebody new to fly. Despite its flaws, Liftoff is my favorite simulator and I find myself coming back to it time and time again.			"

								Takes some getting used to, as with all sims, they seem a bit to easy, but mostly it comes down to that you are more confident ingame than irl.. Seem to me that gravity is a bit funky, takes some getting used to, but overall it's a good sim.Like that you can modify your quad, just hope that some more mods are coming soon, frames,motors,batteries,pros etc. If you could write down you own quads weight and power and get some more realistic thrust/gravity from that this game would get an easy 10/10, now 7/10 which isn't bad for a sim.

The developers DEFINITELY listen to the community (People listed a few bugs, which got fixed the day after - mad props to the developers! They're very approachable.

								So I have been owing this review for a while now :) I started on Liftoff before I had received my first quad parts irl and I can safely say that it has been the single most important asset since I started quading! I have tried other simulators such as DRL, Velocidrone and FPV Freerider recharged without much luck; either the physics engine felt wrong or was simply missing important aspects, the physics settings were awkward or the drones couldn't be tuned right. Liftoff excels in all of these areas. With a bit of knowledge in tuning and a little time spent selecting components you can get a quad in Liftoff to fly about as close to real life as any sim will provide at the moment. And I say this from experience with my real setup. I would thoroughly recommend that ANYONE who flies quads and has free time available in their day should get liftoff and spend some time getting it right and reap the benefits of this awesome sim. Props go to an awesome community of fliers and an amazing dev team that are dedicated to getting updates out regularly. See you on the race track :) "

Early Access Review
								Being fairly new to RC Drones I decided to get a few different simulators like this one, both FPV Freerider sims, Velocidrone, FPV Event and the free DRL Simulator. From the testing I've done there seems to be a large void between how each one feels and how close to the real thing they get, for example Liftoff seems to be more like an arcade game with the feeling I get from the controls, where it seems to have way to much punch the second you move the throttle stick. So just getting used to it isn't easy even when you fly in level/stability mode, it does get better in acro but the same issue with the punch power is still there. Like I've said I have several of these sims and the two I have found closest to real life are FPV Event and Velocidrone and it's because they both seem to be setup with real world physics. I fly a Robocat 270 racing drone and it has plenty of power and is capable of around 60/70 mph, and it feels nothing like the drones in Liftoff because they just shoot upwards like their on steroids.  And when it comes to the workbench screen I find the lack of contrast ridiculas because its hard to see whats on the screen unless im sat inches away from it, so I think the developers could take a look at changing the Font size and background colour to make it easier for people to be able to read the information either in the workbench parts description or the flight controller settings screen. Apaert from that I do think Liftoff has loads of scope to be improved and it will only take some tiny tweaks to get it close to a full on drone simulator, and at it's price point I do think it could be a whole lot better.  But if like me you are finding it hard to get your head around I would recommend trying some of the free ones like DRL simulator or the free trial of FPV Event, as like me you will notice just what I have, Liftoff is a great simulator but it's not quite real enough.

								Great game! I love its drone simulation. The DIY Drone Workshop is very interesting, although I'm not sure how it affects the actual drone performance! The controller calibration and setup is very to use. This game supports the Steam Controller, you can either use the standard Gamepad template as-is, or you can bind the gyro to the Right joystick, which means pitch and roll can be controller by moving your Controller which is an awesome way to control a drone. Make sure to bind a button to enable Acro mode which is super fun!The only downsides I can think of is the weird max height (60m or so?) which you cannot turn off or raise, and super small map boundaries - not actual map boundaries, but artificial ones, so even if it looks like you have a huge map, you can only fly in 10% of it or so. This makes no sense and hopefully will be fixed. Of course, there need to be some boundaries, but they can be natural, like some super high mountains or something, or just make at least 80% of the map accessible, instead of what seems to be 10%.Also, a great feature would be wind simulation - it would be nice to get some practice flying against the wind.

There are 5 levels, a field with gates, woods, hangar stadium and underground garage, which are pretty much most common places to practise this sport. I love the feature to set the flight controller and the cosmetics of the quad. I used my old worn off xbox 360 controller and it worked quite well after playing with the settings a little and calibrating it in the game menus. Seting up the Taranis X9 plus was easy.

								Lift Off is the ultimate in multirotor simulator games!!! this is an early release however it's still better than many released sims on the market! they've already had a couple of updates to fix some issues, bugs, and add enhancements.Seems they're listening to those who add requests and bugs. I have the immersion vortex, and it's very close to flying fpv, so this is a MUST HAVE FOR PRACTICING!there's still alot to explore in Pine valley, can't wait for more additions and features, I'll be playing all winter when ever I can't be out side @ sites flying.I have several radio's and it's working with , Spektrum DX5e,DX6(no issues), Turnigy 9Xpro (no issues), FRSky Taranis+(read help info available, little tricky to setup on plus, but works),Using a couple different simm usb cables. I want to say thank you for creating this simm, and releaseing it early!, is Awesome!!!!Can't wqait for the physical Vortex 250 pro release!!!! please send me 1?????????Thanks Again!			"

I've been following Liftoff for quite some time now-- each release just gets better and better.Now that multiplayer is in the game, races bring on a whole new adrenaline rush!

								LiftOff is the kind of game that serves to do a job - introduce you to the world of FPV racing drones and to let you practice thek ind of skills that you would use in the real world with a real drone. As such I don't consider it a full and complete game experience, but it is very helpful if you're interested in racing drones. I explain some of this in the video below.The game features a half-dozen ""maps"" and the option to customise the maps if you wish to with race features such as flags and markers. You can just fly around the maps, or engage in races against your ghost-self or against other people in multiplayer.You DO need a controller to play liftoff, and it's best with a SERIOUS controller, such as a FrySky Taranis (about $200), but with any old USB controller you can have some fun and see if you think racing drones are for you. I do recommend it - not so much as a game - but as somewhere to practice your skills and to try out things that mgiht break a real world quadcopter!

								I`m new to FPV, just built my first drone, bought a cheap Flysky FS-I6 transmitter as I was not sure I will enjoy flying at all, and I soon realized I`m probably the worst pilot in the whole world!!! Found this sim, and everything changed for good. I managed to set up my Flysky controller with a USB simulator cable (cheap on Ebay), spent only an hour on ACRO mode and I crash a lot less than before. I highly recommend this software to everyone who want to learn to fly a quadcopter.			"

								Currently one of the best fpv simulators.Flight physics are getting better and are already pretty close to reality depending on your setup.In the experimental branch it feels better at the moment so i am sure there will be huge improvements in the future.Multiplayer works great and i like the idea of having competitions in the future.Liftoff is also great for beginners to learn flying acro and getting a feel for drone racing but make sure to have the right controller.The best controller is probably still the taranis and it feels pretty natural even if the resolution is currently still reduced by the unity engine but sadly that is something the engine developers have to fix.Another option are simple, old usb simulator controllers that are sadly pretty hard to find now. Or just grab any radio with ppm trainer port and use a simulator adapter or your soundcard with something like smartpropoplus. The turnigy evolution has a terribly slow update rate at this point and until that is fixed in a different firmware i probably won't recommend using that.I hope there will be more and better usb controllers available in the future without the need of ppm adapters.tl;drGrab your rc remote and have fun :)			"

								Terrible music. You have to press Esc on the keyboard and use the mouse every time you want to change music track, instead of just using a button on the controller.The menu is pretty bad. There's only an option to ""save and exit"" no option for ""discard changes and exit"". This would be usefull when changing controls since you can't undo a keybind, only replace it by another keybind. If you mark a keybind and you don't press any keys, it will go back to ""None"" after a couple of seconds, but that is NOT very intuitive!The tutorial does not work.With two monitors the game starts on 2nd monitor. I have to press Windows+Shift+Right arrow to put the game on main monitor every time I start the game.The game has controller presets for Xbox One controller, which I use even though I have Xbox 360 for Windows controller. Because if I make a custom calibration etc. the game will not recognize the controller in the menu. Even though I use the Xbox One preset that works the best, I still can't go back in the menu, only up, down, left, right and further. I have to use keyboard or mouse if I want to go back in the manu.After a couple of hours of tweaking I like the game more, but I'm sure people buying this game just to play a videogame may not find the fun immediately. I like it because I want to fly racing quadcopters, but in the start it's not very userfriendly and guideable, so it took many hours before I figured out to make proper tweaks to the controls etc.			"

								I fly quads myself and have a fleet of 4 4s racequads at home. Liftoff has enormous potential to become the best fpv simulator there is. As of right now it is a fun distration and something to get me through the winter.Pro- The ability to build custom quads with different lipos, props, motors, etc.- physics - feels almost real- graphics- fpv noise- fly the Vortex ProContra- workbench is still very limited with the best lipo being a nanotech 45c and the best prop being a 5045 Gemfan carbon fibre. I fly HQ triblades or HQ 6045 paired with 70c Thunderpower lipos, so there's a huge difference in power- the physics of a damaged prop do not feel real at all. In reality a slightly damaged prop will be compensated by the flightcontroler and not make your quad almost impossible to control- needs more models than just Vortex and Vortex Pro with different electronics			"

								I really had high hopes for this game.  It is good, but far from a polished gem.  Wish the developers had focused a bit more on the customization options for the quads instead of the annoying goggle animation at the start of each flight.  The standard quad does lack punch, even though I change motors, props, and battery from 3s to 4s. It also seems a bit ""floaty"", but that might just be me. Will keep on playing as it is a useful tool, looking forward to improvements in the future especially under the customization options.  This has the potential to be a really great FPV sim.			"

								I think Roundabout you are on a Good Way... -What does not fit in any case is the Gravity she is not realistic.-Full throttle flying feeling is to drive a Train on rails, no shocks no vibrations... and just not feeling right for Racing. -The sound it is much too high as if it is a 3-4 x speedup from the original Vortex Sound.-It would be nice also an original ImmersionRC Vortex OSD.-The RC Setup loses its setting Look at videos and compares it.

								This is me: I've never flown a quad copter or any airborn RC vehicle in my life but recently took a strong interest in FPV quads. So after a bit of research I discovered this simulator and bought it to help me get used to the controls while I begin buying/putting-together my first quad.As of 03/05/16:(using Xbox 360 controller)Summary: I'm really enjoying this early-access simulator. It seems to be very well put together and is a realistic (within reason) FPV simulator.The physics seem to be near spot-on compared to footage I've seen of FPV'ers, though I have to agree with some of the reviewers here, they do seem slightly floaty. The collision and prop damage models are good, but I found myself wishing for a less forgiving collision model when it came to tree branches. Perhaps there might be a 'difficulty setting' regarding the damage model in future? The visuals are fantastic for a performance-oriented simulator. The models are well-made, and the film grain and distortion prove to be highly immersive and make me feel like I'm actually controlling (and crashing) the quad.Sound design is passable, as is par in most realistic simulators in my experience. It would be nice to hear some improvements here but definitely not neccessary.The UI is well laid out, though not free of small issues. I suspect they will be remedied swiftly and easily.Conclusion: I'm looking forward to multiplayer and any of the other features/improvements to come. I definitely plan on continuing to practice using this simulator for many days to come. Also, I'll update this review once I have a transmitter and have flown an actual quad so as to compare the physics.			"

								After about 28 hours all together playing and fooling around I can say it's good learning tool for novice and not only. I preety much learnt and gaining confidence flying Acro. Floatines, not always breaking props are not an arguments really when it come to learning how to fly. It just feel like very light and powerfull quadcopter. You will learn correct reactions and stick movements without thinking about it and that's the most important! FreeRider for comparision - feels like driving a bus - slow and heavy. There are already examples of people learning to fly in LiftOff and taking skills outside and flying real racing quadcopters succcesfuly! After some time spend adjusting values in Player.xml file I have achieved behaviour which is very close to TheX I have build. It may not be a Vortex but it's fast, agile and on rails! For some still will be floaty but that more less like my copter is with HQ6045 cos is light and powerful. Mass can be changed a bit more but it will affect speed, lift and drift - more mass more drift. Rates are more personal settings so go ahead and adjust them to your liking.Try it and let me know if you like it. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qFMjmh8KjgZ3E1elc5ejZnUGc/view "

								This Game is Amazing!(JUST SAYING THIS GAME REQUIRES A CONTROLER) It actually feels like you’re flying the drone! They’ve done such a good job on this game. The tutorial sucked though, it’s a really bad way to start someone off who’s never handled a drone before. It’s difficult for someone who hasn’t had any experience. The tutorial level is really confusing and hard to tell where stuff is because the whole of the map is the same colour with no definition or shadows. I was playing the tutorial for ages not getting anywhere with my skill. But then I played the actual maps. The forest is the best map because it’s fun and easy! After playing on the forest map for a short time I really got the hang of the controls and synched all the other maps including the carpark witch is apparently the hardest. The graphics are stunning when camera sound is off, terrific use of shadows. Overall the game takes a bit to get use to but if you keep persisting by playing the tutorial for an hour or two then move onto the forest map you’ll be pro in no time! And this simulater is actualy helping me upskill with my IRL fpv drone.			"

								This simulator is AMAZING! It completly blew all my expectations out of the water. I was a noob, never flown a quad fpv style. The only experience I even had flying was a small blade nano qx flying line of sight. I got myself a Taranis X9d Plus, messed around on this simulator now for maybe 4+ hours total time.  By then i had enough confidence so I went out and bought the real deal a Vortex 250 pro and some Headplay Hd goggles. Maiden flight went off perfect, I was so impressed by how much the simulator actually feels like the real thing. All i have to say is THANK YOU LIFTOFF!!!!.  This Sim is worth every penny spent. Gave me every bit of confidence I needed without it I more the likely would have never got into this awesome hobby.If anyone would like to see the maiden flight ill post a link i hope its allowed

								Well I'm sad to say, that I've spent 10 hrs on this game and I still haven't gotten off the ground........  My first problem is Before I got my Taranis I tried to use my x-box controler and i never got it to work..... so i gave up. i figured that i'd wait until i got my Taranis, but now that i have it i can't bind it to the game and i can't even get the contoller options to work, eveytime i click on options it just disappears from the screen, so i can't even get to options...... i am so frustrated that i can't give this game a good raiting as i haven't played it yet............ if anyone knows how to reset the game or how i can get it to work, would be much apreciated..  also I'm running a Macbook Pro. thanks			"

								Ever since the update, the game has become unlayable for me.  Calibration works fine but leaves my x/y axis ""shaky"" (the developers don't like the use of these words but oh well, suck it up)  I tried following setup instructions a few times, still no luck.  It seems like if I lower the rates, it runs a little more stable.   But what good is a simulator if you can't simulate your personal style/feeling in the real world?  All your fleet of drones are great but they float unless you spend time switching your PIDs, I wish there was a setting for gravity/drag.  In the real world, some setups are heavier than others.  Overall is OK.I'll stick to Hotprops or freerider sim.  One is free, the other is only $5.  The feel is much more realistic.			"

								The game had pretty good reviews so i thought i'll give it a try. I own Aerofly 7 and this works great with my Spektrum DX8, Logitech F710, Keyboard & Mouse... however  Lift-off fails on this simple and yet essential feature..it doesn't support ANY of those input devices... sure, there are ppl with a Tranis, XBox controller or some might have luck with their keyboard and mouse.. however for my part it doesn't work at all. Assigning keys didn't work for me, calibrating a gamepad neither....I managed to start a Quadcopter with the F710 gamepad finally and was able to maneuvere a bit... but then again controlls were not right and i didn't find a way to calibrate em in a corret matter...If the game itself works for you it might be fun - i had only trouble...

								Though this seems like a great game I cant say that it is because they do not allow keyboard and mouse controls into their game. They state that in the system requirments which are mostly used to describe the hardware inside of ones tower. It could be fixed by just adding an option for keyboard but recommend a controller. I will gladly play if they ever add this but until then I cannot use this game.			"

								It seems like the developers have gone for a minimalistic stylish gee-whiz interface when it comes to the controls. I ended up with 2 control axes inverted, and instead of a simple check-box like every other game ever to invert that axis you just have to auto-detect that axis and move it opposite of what the game prompts you.Do you end up with multiple control axes with the center point way off? Well, tough cookies because the game doesn't let you adjust that. Spent a bunch of time farting around with windows controller options (Which shows my inputs as properly centered, contrary to what the game thinks), only to have nothing work at all.The games auto-calibration is junk, at least for me. It ends up centering your sticks WAY off, then as I said you can't do anything to fix it.Seriously, for a control-heavy game like flying a twitchy race quad, I would think giving the player a multitude of control options would be common sense.Really want to like this, but until the control issues are fixed (Just giving options would do the trick!), refunded.

								Extremely limited location options, with very restrictive flight area.Youve got open field that you must not go higher than 75 meters or outsidewhat appears to be 2 acres of a fenced in area with hay bales or the game resets.next option a pine forest with a 60 meter cap on alt and if you deviate from course it resets,lastly you have a parking garage that I honestly wasnt even interested in trying.The Freeflight mode has all the same restrictions.  Not even close to me going outside my backdoor and flying.   Waste of time and money and effort.The customization of the quads is limited to swapping props, and motors from limited selection(specs not editable).			"

								Not particularly an accurate sim. It randomly resets the game with absolutely no cause at all, yet you can literally fly through the branches and leaves of a tree several times before it detects damage and resets. I've tried both a wired TGY 9x using SmartPropoPlus and a Spektrum DX6e via OrangeTX DSMX USB dongle and the results are the same, a barely controllable craft. Throttle is insanely twitchy even with a ton of expo. If you want/need to fly close to the ground absolutely good luck as it's virtually impossible to keep even the most basic quad more than 10-20' off the deck.IT decides when you have flown too high or too far and warns you to turn back, yet even if you do so immediately it's fade to black, reset the game.Good idea, but extremely poor execution. At least sink/fall rates feel way more realistic than DRL. But DRL feels better designed and more realistic. I'm feeling that I should have kept my refund instead of buying it again.			"

								Very disappointing. The maps themselves are reasonably sized, but in a misguided design decision to prevent players bumping up against artificial walls, the actual useable size of the map is enormously small. Drifting outside of it produces a ""reset timer"" that ends your flight and does not allow sufficient time to get back inside the flight zone. Attempts to have this made a user-configurable option on the community forums were essentially stonewalled - first under the excuse that ""it would kill the immersion"" and then contradicted by the second excuse ""we need to provide a uniform experience for all people, and your actual immersion is not a factor"". A reasonable compromise, being a user discretion on what kind of experience they would like, was not able to be advocated for as the thread was promptly locked. Actual reason: developer arrogance.

								not bad...cant load custom maps----------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this game first day it came out.  Played with it for 3mins and it was in such poor shape I gave it up. Before <LuGus Studios> cries, I will explain why I felt it was so bad.1. my futaba didnt work with it and yes I have all the tools I needed. 2. my t8j didnt work with it...ok, so I pulled out my xbox controller and played.... phyics sucked,  graphics was OK....but eh...the realisticity of a fpv game is all about the phyics...so if the phyics sucks, the game sucks, so...there I left it untouched and fly my real stuff. recently, I found that freerider recharged is out. I loved the 1st one so much I had to buy the 2nd one. ehh, guess what freerider recharged is awesome! it felt great. When I crash, the quad resets instantly where in liftoff you gotta wait or reset it manually. (hate it)after hours and hours of the new freerider, I decided to update liffoff and give it 1 more try.hahaha! hey! it supports my T8J now! so I got it all setup.....played for abit .... 1. phyics is still bad...at least in freerider I can tune it so it feels real enough,....2. picking your quad parts is the worst......they are not even real, except of IRC products. lol ok.....I get it...this game is powered by them...still...3. I have a pc many people can only dream of and its still a slow loading game. 4. I dont want to embarass you but Im in the I.T industry and I know what Im doing. I placed my files in the right folders and they just dont show up in the game. I dont wanna have to reinstall it to try coz its not worth the time. #123 explains it all. You want a better review? here you go. ""There's no reason why you should not be able to load custom maps. This is a user error, not an issue with the software.""            well, I am telling you there is. I said ""not bad"" coz I love fpv and Im sure you guys love it as much as I do. There was my respect for you guys.  My true thoughts? it is a poorly developed game. you guys made fpv boring. that is hard to do. I gave it a thumbs down coz that is my opinion.I PREFER PLAYING FREERIDER OVER THIS GAME.troll me all you want LuGus Studios  [developer].there is my detailed review and I will stick to it. You may think I know nothing about FPV lolI will tell you this much, I am living in Hong Kong. ya.. I play with the newest toys or stuff that aint even out yet.

								last review deleted so, so here we go again...okay *game* but simulation it isn’t.no aerodynamic model, hence no ground effect, very floaty gravity, some motors behave oddly in response to throttle.damage system just hopeless, sometimes clip a leaf and seconds later a prop falls off, other times you can make leaf salad without damage… why bother with damage that effects flight dynamics if you damaged an actual quad that much you’d just stop flying even in a race.vtx must be 1 kilowatt to punch video through that many trees over such distance, some really unrealistic levels.Sliding on the ground (which has the same friction as ice) will slightly damage a prop instead of the prop digging in and flipping you chaotically.The game might help you improve real life flying but equally could leave you with bad habits. Needs more work... and a proper aerodynamic model			"

								I bought this program to train myself at flying my DJI Mavic or DJI Phantom Quads.  Little did i realize that this is a FPV drone sim only.  It does not offer the ability to fly a drone from 3rd person or from the view of the pilot.. You are locked into a FPV camera.  But that's not why i don't recommend it.. I do not recommend this sim because of the controls..The quads auto throttle in this game.  I dont want it to auto throttle.. I want to control the throttle.   Once arming the drone for flight, your drone will automaticlly go up in the air and will continue to acend until you press down on your controller.  This is not how it should be.  The drone should not go up, unless i hit throttle up.. and when my sticks go to their center position, it should hover.  I tried several presets, and both ATTI, and Level modes.  There is a built in preset for the Xbox One Controller for windows, but it auth throttles.I made my own preset, and specifically set throttle up/down, and it still auto throttled.  Refunded this POS. They need to fix the throttle controls, and at least put a pilot view without FPV in there.  They also need to tell people that this is FPV only.			"

								After latest update i can surely recommend this one.It's pretty bare bones for now. Only 2 levels are playable and only acro mode is flyable. But flight dynamics already feel pretty good, a little bit easier than real life. If you are looking for a training sim, you can still spend hours on those 2 levels, and you can set up most things like power, rates, camera FOV/tilt.Looking forward for new updates!			"

								I've been into FPV multirotors for about 4 months - totally addicted. A friend suggested I save some props and get this sim to practice on, and I have to admit - this is the best quadcopter simulator available BAR NONE. Even in its infancy, I can see the potential of this sim. The flight characteristics, handling, even bad tuning... What a great investment! I am really enjoying the track editor, and hope to see some cool community offerings in that respect. I can't wait to have more objects to build with, more parts to trick out my ship, and more maps to fly in. This simulator is the shizz. hunned p'cent.			"

								For the few weeks that i had my first mini quad (race drone) in pieces, i purchased this game. In my down time, i played the maps, got used to the controlls and even downloaded player customized coarses. When i finally went for my maiden flight today, i was hesitant. But, i have SOO much more confidence now. Thanks to practicing in Liftoff, I was able to casually fly around the woods and dodge trees, However, Branches are a bit more forgiving in the game but i dealt with it. I want to thank the developers of the game and the users that have provided their custom tweeked profiles to give me as real of an in game experience as possible.			"

								This is currently the best and most realistic FPV sim available. I have tried them all and this by far comes the closest to actually flying FPV. This is the perfect tool for practicing it is so convenient and well done. I get about 3 minutes of flight time on my quad when I'm really pushing it so I need 20 batteries to get one hour of practice. With this I can just throw on the goggles and practice for a couple of hours without even leaving the house.			"

								I was looking for a drone sim that had some polish to it and settled on Liftoff after trying Freerider and RDS. For 20 bucks it isn't a bad place to get some core concepts of fpv drone flight down. I am currently enjoying using the almost stock vortex since the two blade props are a little easier for myself. I'm also using an Xbox 360 controller since I don't own a TX.I can't speak on realism never having flown an fpv, but it feels close to what I would imagine how it would be minus any sort of wind.Pros:Customization of the drone itselfGood UI, but needs some tweaking for reliability with both controllers and kb/mouseProp damage (not realistic, but a good enough simulation of what might happen)Feels generally goodCons:Very clear to still be in developement with a few bugs here and thereImmersion RC seems to own the game, but that also means you get to use a representation of real gearNo wind simulationI enjoy it right now and I'm looking forward to picking up a real drone and hopefully being able to take skills from this into the real world sometime soon.

								It's a pretty decent drone racing sim.  A warning for anyone who isn't an experienced drone pilot though - this is not going to be an easy game to just pick up and play.  It's a pretty realistic sim, and they've made the ""race"" modes realistic as well, meaning the gates are all tiny, and low to the ground.  For an inexperienced pilot, expect to practice for several hours or more before you successfully complete any of the races.  I really think they should add some beginner race tracks, with big, forgiving gates.Also, there's some bugginess with the prop damage, and the auto-reset doesn't always work (sitting there with no props left, and have to manually restart).  Not sure why they wanted to do prop damage the way they did.  You can accidentally just bounce a little on the ground when you go to lift off, and it'll damage your props.  Not very realistic at all.So yeah, there's a lot they could do to improve it, but if you're looking for a decent FPV sim for training purposes, this is it.  If you're looking for a fun arcadey game you can pick up and quickly learn, this isn't for you.			"

								This is, in my admittedly biased opinion, THE best drone racing gamulator (game/simulator).Nice flight physics, diverse environments, a track editor, time trials (or free flight if you prefer), and an awesome community. Not to mention very professional and open developers!The recent addition of multiplayer makes this even more bloody addictive!""One more race! I'm not going to smack into a gate this time!""			"

								Awesome graphics with the latest update but unfortunately the quad physics still feel floaty and sluggish. I really want to love this game but at the moment untill we are given the options to tune gravity effects and tune the flying experience feel more realistic, liftoff will remain the second choice to fpvfreerider. I really believe this game could be amazing with some physics tweaks, I just hope it gets there!			"

								After latest update i can surely recommend this one.It's pretty bare bones for now. Only 2 levels are playable and only acro mode is flyable. But flight dynamics already feel pretty good, a little bit easier than real life. If you are looking for a training sim, you can still spend hours on those 2 levels, and you can set up most things like power, rates, camera FOV/tilt.Looking forward for new updates!			"

								Despite it being early days, this is a very good FPV quad sim.I have been flying a real Vortex quad since June 2015, so I think I can judge quite well the quality of this sim and I'm pretty happy. It does feel like the gravity is a little off, and so throttle control is a little easier than in reality but I imagine this will be fixed quite soon.The current three maps it comes with are quite good. The first map has proper sized racing gates, which is exactly what this kind of sim should have. The racing module is not yet there, but I have very high hopes considering how much fun I had doing laps of the field through the gates.The pine wood map is also great fun, and I especially enjoyed this as I prefer to take my real Vortex into a pine wood quite often.I would recommend this game especially to people that already own a quad, or are thinking about getting one. For everyone else, I'd probably wait till more features have been added, as it will be a very fun game when it's more complete, but for now it's a very good sim.			"

								I fly and build real racing quads and have for a long time and got this one for curiositys sake and i also fly all the other FPV sims that are available. This is the best looking one and most polished - but it's a game and not a sim.My real copters have more vertical performance and are faster than even the most souped up custom builds in the game and the real one turns better too. You have to play around with the settings to get it to fly remotly as a real copter and even if you do it's still too floaty - it takes ages for gravity to take hold of your machine, on a real one it pretty much drops like a rock when you lower the throttle and it does not slide in turns as much as in the ""sim"".It's fun as its very easy to make complicated moves but if you attempt that with a real one it's much harder as you just dont have that amount of time, reality is faster and meaner - and totaly unforgiving and we need that as a setting.

								Okay, so first off, I haven't tried any other quad simulators other than Phoenix RC which is really built for planes, but so far, LiftOff seems really good and even in Early Access, is great value for money! Yes, there are a few minor glitches and yes, the gravity is a bit off, but what do you expect for a game in Early Access? I've already improved my skills and it's a great game when it's rainy and you can't fly, or want to practice a few moves without breaking a ton of props. Already have gotten a friend of mine to buy the game and he seems pretty happy too! Just do a little reading on how you should connect your transmitter to your computer (SmartPropoPlus, USB cable etc) and you're good to go.			"

I really enjoyed flying and could be an amazing tool to improve your flying skills saving lots of money.As a beginner pilot (I'm flying with a basic drone during the weekend) i could say it is pretty realistic even if there is some work to do (you're on the right path!).Best money ever spent!

								This game is one of the more well polished drone sims currently out there, and that's quite a bit to say since it's still in beta. It's really accurate to the point where you can actually learn how to fly a racing or freestyle drone without risk of damaging a real one. Only one thing that becomes a let down is how contricted the current maps feel. they are relatively small, and the height limit is pretty short. Other than that, Liftoff is well worth the asking price. I definitely recommend! sidenote: The game supports actual radio controls, so if you have one, I suggest using it.			"

								Starting to dial this simulator in, it is getting better and better with each update.The latest patch is great and I've not even had time to check out the multiplayer freeflight!  Definitely smoothed things up graphics wise.It still takes a little tweaking to get the flight feel you want, but its very possible to get quite close to real life flight feel when using the same RC you normally use.I highly recommend this to practice without risk of crashing your precious quads especially if you are like me and just starting out.  Even if the flight feel is not quite perfect you still pick up stick control skills that will pay dividends when you take your quads outdoors.I recorded some flights and my setings and meshed them together here

								Getting into this, we'll call it a sport, don't get me wrong I love it, but it is quite expensive, building, flying, crashing repairing... I could go on, this game allows you to enjoy it without all the wallet lightening drawbacks.  plus I have scant time for such things as it is so it is a lot easier to get on the computer than go to a feild and fly.  the game is great, it is pretty representative of actual flying.  and it relly helps you learn to fly if you are just getting into it.  There are tutorial that are very helpful, and then you can go and fly wherever you want on any of the tracks that they have.overall it is a great game and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into the sport.

								After months trying to find simulator that is close to real life, I am still with no luck. DRL is floaty, Hotprops is laggy and has funky crash animations. Velocidrone is pretty close, but also feel bit floaty. Liftoff, well, feels ok. But something I can't get over is hover at 50% no matter what I try (500g weight with 5kg+ thrust shouldnt act like that). That feels horrible to what I am used to with real life quad which hovers at 25-30%. It's a shame. Hopefully devs will fix this. Till then its not worth the money.			"

								I will be polite in this review.  If you have any problems at all installing liftoff or getting it to work on your computer (not crashing), than quickly ask for a refund or you will lose your $20.  Of the 5 hours that support claimed i was playing the game, i actually had about 30 minutes of playtime where the flying was unacceptable and I was trying to correct it.  The other 4 plus hours was trying to get the game up and running with both ps4 on a mac or my spektrum dx6 on my windows.   They count everything as playtime... from the second you launch the game.   I am now out $20 and have a game that can't be played.   Maybe future releases might work. ... hmmmm			"

								I haven't tried 'Liftoff' in perhaps 6 months, and thought I'd re-download it to check out what has been updated since.Visually it's still pleasant, but unfortunately, that's where the good starts and ends. FPV racers are concerned with one thing in a sim - the physics...and this feels like it did to me 6 months ago. It's poor. It's no substitute for real flying. FPV Event is by a country mile a better sim. I'd call this a game, not a sim.			"

								It's by far one of the best FPV sims I've used in a while, but it does have some problems.  I have logged 72 days on RealFlight G6.5, so I believe I'm able to say with certainty what I'm experiencing here.  This simulator has decent graphics and the models are pretty smooth when they work.  My only gripe with the simulator is that it intermittently stops communicating with my Taranis.  Hotprops never had this issue, but in this simulator you will be flying perfectly fine when it suddenly starts holding the last stick positions like a failsafe.  It starts about 3:30 into the game in my experience and can ony be fixed by restarting the game.  If you continue playing, the failsafes get even more frequent despite no apparent cause.  It gets really annoying when you have to restart the sim every 4 minutes because it starts glitching.  This sim has great potential and will become my new favorite when the bugs are worked out.Edit:4/22/2017After some recent updates, the issue with the controller stopping has decreased in frequency significantly, so I have no idea what changed.  I have tested it with 3 different cables now and the issues are still present, but they only happen once every two hours or so worth of use which I consider acceptable.  After experimenting with the voltages of the Taranis battery, I have found very little correlation between the batery and failure rate.  This could very well be an isolated incident that only happens on my setup so I don't think it's a big issue.  This simulator has now become one of my most used training systems and I recommend it to anyone wanting to get into the hobby.			"
