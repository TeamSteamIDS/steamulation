												Love these lower horse powered cars.  Provides close door racing and some of the tracks are like roller coasters, such a blast.			"

												this is my favorite expansion for race 07, it adds a lot of really nice touring cars (including the amazing volvo 850!) 2 types of camaro's (gen4 and gen5), and, 6 race tracks i cant pronounce at all but are really fun to drive on and provide alot of close racing. did i say it has the volvo 850?

												Bought a 23 years old Volvo 850 in 2013 to have some fun, in this world of tin and plastic toy cars. Looked up a racing game featuring it. Found STCC The Game 2. I had already 3-4 Simbin titles, and tossed these 2 EUR into it.I am pleased with my purchase. The game is the same, excellent, and I was happy to find my interiors. The only small nagging thing is that the featured Volvo 850 is a right side driving wheel configuration. Cheers.PS I played more, but somewhat Steam deleted my playing history. "
