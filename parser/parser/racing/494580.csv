												Standby is a tough-as-nails platformer made for speedrunners and platforming masochists. The game centers around speed, timing, and precision, with minimalist visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I got through all 54 levels in roughly 3 hours, but this game is meant to be played to perfection, with leaderboards and collectibles for completionists.TLDR: I recommend this for speedrunners and platformer enthusiats looking for a fast-paced challenge.my playthrough:https://www.twitch.tv/ryuze/v/112716606 "

												This game is not about story, not about fights with enemies, not about exploring world. This game is about fast, hard, perfect timing, in cold blood sliding/jumping/runnig/breaking through compact, minimalistic levels, where floors/walls/ceilings..literally anything trying to kill you. And when after endless attempts you'll finally beat the level, you would like to do it again - faster, better, stronger, with collecting all these rombs in your way! Speedrun mode increasy challenge mood. There are no something incredible or special features in this game, no metagame or customisation, but platforming part is very good. SO, if you like such platformers - you should like this thing, it really gives you strong emotions!P.S. Electronic soundtrack is really charming! "

												Amazing game, very hard but enjoyable once you beat another level C: +Visuals: Juicy colorful and stylish, easy to determinate every kind of terrain.+Soundwork: Amazing OST (10 songs that you can switch at any time, mid level too)+Gameplay: Now about the gameplay - this game is kind of similar to the Dustforce idea with all those dashes and slideshttp://steamcommunity.com/id/nekomimibadik/recommended/65300Like Dustforce, in the future, and without dust :)Now the very IMPORTANT thing about this game - it does not tolerate button mashing! You will die a lot until you realize that button spam leads nowhere but to the sudden death. It also requires high multitasking skill!Levels are hard, like really hard, up to the frustrating limit, and even more, you have a built-in option for a speedrun (don't even try it). Great thing about that game that after death restarts are super quick, like srsly, once you die - and you die all the time - restart feels really smooth. +Controls - what is the most important thing for the platformer is the controls precision - this game has great controls, no input lag, nothing, easy to control your character if you know what you are doing. Bad thing that there are no buttons remap at the moment so I hope it will be implemented in the future+Steam cards+Steam achievements - achievements in that game are close to the impossible - all those beat the timer achievements require godlike skills :((

STANDBY is a fast-paced timing-based platformer, combining the difficulty and frustration of Super Meat Boy with the bright, neon style from BARRIER X.The full review is too large to put into a Steam user review, so you can view it here. We also have pictures![www.gamesworthbuying.com] "

												Great game, really fast paced and fun overall.It's a bit hard to coordinate all your mechanics at start but you will improve. Seems like an ideal game for speedrunning.I liked I wanna be the boshy, Super Meat Boy, etc, where you need to memorize stuff and be very coordinated, and this ticks the same boxes in this regard			"

												Insaneeee!! Amo este tipo de juegos y la verdad es que probe la demo y me parecio un excelente juego, algo frenetico, un poco complicado el intentar completar los mapas a la perfeccion y al menor tiempo posible, pero divertido, en general un excelente trabajo de parte de los desarrolladores.10/10			"

												It's like an easier version of Dustforce. I loved Dustforce, but it was a little bit too difficult for me, and I couldn't finish some of the levels and wasn't able to beat the game. STANDBY is a perfect stand-in since I don't have much time for gaming, and always wanted a bite-sized game to master and get good at speed running.			"

 When I won this game in a giveaway on reddit by saying the driest and worst joke ever, I started playing it and I directly noticed som PROs and CONs  CONs Since I like playing platformers with controllers I grabbed my DS4 controller and tested it wasn't fully working so i thought ""oh let me just use DS4Windows"" (DS4Windows is like an PS4 controller to xbox360 converter) and yeah it worked better but not perfect.when choosing song and you pressed Dpaddown or pulled the joystick down the songs didnt choose next but instead they selected the previouse songAnother thing was in the controls menu it just showed ""X/SQUARE"" for ACTION and ""A/CROSS"" for JUMP but how to slide weren't listed there.And when trying t0select quit you got 2 options ""YES"" and ""NO"" and this part is good so you dont accedently quit but the thing was i couldn't change it with the Dpad i needed to use the jojstick.I was also lacking in the control setup choice, I can understand why it could be hard to code so the user can change his controls, but i would've really appreciated like 3 different premade setups And last CON, I have a really hard time controlling the menu controls I would REALLY want an option to change the meny to more  classic  controls like ""ENTER"" for select and on controllers ""A/CROSS"" and back on controller could be ""B/CIRCLE"" PROs The ART STYLE IS AMAAAAZING, I love the character the level design. A truly good job with thatAnd the music is soooo goood if you can please add moreThe Gameplay and the fastpaced style with the instant respawn. I LOVE ITI think the menus look very good and that you have made it compatible with all reslolutions Last WordsI know I pointed out very small things but its all meant to be taken as constructive criticism so you can make the game better and if you do I think this game and your company will have many supportersSCORE: it's not the number that counts its the experience and joy you get when you play it not because it was given a 10/10WISH YOU BEST OF LUCK MAN			"

												Stanby is a very fast-paced and stylish precision platformer. If you like a challenge then this game will satisfy your itch for hard as nails platforming. You will die many times trying to beat a level but will be filled with satisfation when you fianlly pull off the right combination of moves to finally put that level away.Check out my video for more in depth thoughts.

												Very challenging and addictive game, when regular attempts to pass the level becomes some kind of meditation (if you will not crash your gamepad of the wall while playing first levels). Nice visual style and soundtrack.			"

												Tried my best to enjoy the game, but its controls are not responsive enough. I've got that frustrating feeling of ""I'm sure I hit that jump button!"" when my character doesn't actually jump - which is not present in the likes of Super Meat Boy. It's just annoying.			"

												Ah man I have a love/hate relationship with platformers but I can't stop playing them, and this is one of the most platformers out there that made me love/hate them so fast.The graphics are charming, simple enough, yet vibrant with colors and shape, it makes the game feel alive, the controls are solid and smooth, like the  should be, because really you don't want to make this game any harder with bad controls. It's teeth grinding level difficult, you should memorize every move you make and mistake. Overall it's so much fun, even though you will rage, you will enjoy the hell out of it.			"

												When I bought this, I thought it would be similar to other platforming games. While that is true to some extent, this is a much worse version of your stereotypical platformer. You have to be very precise, like in most platformers, but most of the game mechanics make this very frustrating. One of my main issues with this game is jumping. While jumping, you have no control of the character other than making him dash to the ground. In addition, there are only 3 directions of jumping: straight up, diagonal left, and diagonal right. This means that if you jump right, and see you are jumping too far, there is nothing you can do about it. Another one of my compaints is how the dash mechanic works. If you are running, you can hit a button to dash. The problem is, if you hit a direction at the same time as the dash button, sometimes you will not dash, because it does not register you as running. lost of times I am on a small platform, and without thinking, I hit run and dash at the same time, but dash does not work, so I die. In addition, there is no way to buffer a dash in the air, so you have to time it perfectly when you land. The final thing I am going to say is the lasers. After a few levels, lasers start showing up that blink on and off. This is a problem because it takes away from the speedrunning aspect of the game. When I am trying to finish a level with record time, the lazers seem very random, and I am doing the same thing over and over hoping the lazer with be off when I am there, because that is how to get the fastest time. Other than these things, It is a great game, but these issues make it very frustrating, and in my oppinion, not worth playing.			"

												Satisfying fast-paced gameplay with amazing music. Most of the time i play my games with a video/stream on my second monitor or I listen to a podcast, but in this game the music is such a part of the satisfying gameplay that I just played the game with some good headphones.The Gameplay is fun as hell, i already loved the demo but the full game brings so much more...
