												Where do I start with this...Need for Speed Undercover has been bashed, beaten & overall just despised by the entire Need for Speed community, often described as ""one of the absolute worst Need for Speed games ever made"". But, judging you see that giant blue thumbs up, you obviously can tell that I don't think that way.Now, those of you who really hate long reviews (because there's gonna be quite a lengthy one ahead), here's a short pros-n'-cons review to not waste your time:Pros:+Can run on a toaster+Great soundtrack+Huge car selection+Easy-to-follow story+Simple controls that are even very playable on a keyboard+Visuals are passable+Gameplay is rather funCons:-Story is inconsistent and highly forgettable-Visual glitches regarding the sky & the sun (sun flies from one part of the screen to the other while the sky spins in a nauseating fashion)-Horrible racer & cop AI-No ""Perfect Start"" (a prominent feature in Most Wanted, Carbon & World)-Steam Overlay (unfortunately) does not work with Undercover, due to EA not patching out the old, outdated Steam Overlay DLLs in the game's filesDo I recommend?If you just want a racing game where you could really care less for story & want one that can run on your toaster computer, then yes, NFS Undercover should fill that niche for you quite nicely & I recommend the game for the price it's asking.Now then, short review done. Let's get on with the long review!The Story & The Characters:I'm not gonna bother with a brief synopsis of the story, since that's what the store page basically tells you. But what I will give will be my thoughts on the story. So. I think the story in Undercover is garbage. It's very sloppily put together. Some characters come & go without a proper explanation, some characters are given NO INTRODUCTION and just sort of...appear, other characters for some reason or another just swap roles mid-story, eh, you get the point. I get that it's to be expected that a racing game will have a terrible story, but back when this game was announced & being promoted like the next best thing, it tried to take itself seriously, with all the trailers & promotional videos. So, yes, the story is trash, introduces characters & gets rid of characters periodically & tries to take itself way too seriously, which is why I don't like it & find it very forgettable. It shouldn't take you more than 10 hours to beat the entire story, I, for one, beat the single player campaign in around 8 hours & now am doing my second runthrough on the Steam version of this game, just for the sake of adding in more gameplay hours.The Visuals & Audio:Before I move on to the meat of the review, being the gameplay, I wanna briefly go over the game's visuals. They look...passable. Now, I've had the pleasure of experiencing this game both in 1080p Ultra Settings & 360p Very Low Settings, and generally - I am impressed with the framerate. The game (for the most part) is very consistent with the framerate on newer hardware & back when my good PC was still alive & played this game for the 8 hours it took to complete the single player campaign, the framerate was crazy-stable at 60 FPS, with sometimes dropping below when there were too many cops at once, which is understandable. As for the visuals themselves, everything in the game world, including the road you drive on & the water beyond the shores looks ""alright"" at best. Yes, Black Box has done MUCH better in terms of visuals in Carbon & even Most Wanted, but I don't think the game looks ugly by any means, but certainly doesn't live up to the 2008 year it came out on. And the audio? The car sounds are remarkably pleasant to listen to, giving off the feeling that the car you drive FEELS like an actual car and not a freaking go-kart. The soundtrack is picked rather well & there are a handful of songs I don't like, sure, I like most of the soundtrack.The Gameplay:And now, we move on to the meat of the review - the gameplay. Need for Speed Undercover's gameplay tries to emulate the critically-acclaimed gameplay of Most Wanted & Carbon while trying to introduce enough new things to stand on its own. First of all - the controls are great. Every car feels very responsive & turning even with the slowest of muscle cars while using a keyboard, not a controller or wheel, felt super reliable & the car showed no signs of delayed turns or any kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some racing games usually have, which is great, as great control is what makes the game great. There are, however, a few things I really don't like about the gameplay. Gone from Most Wanted & Carbon are perfect starts, which require to get your speedometer stick on a certain part of the actual speedometer when it changes color to give your car a bit of a necessary boost when you start, unless you want to drag on for about 30 seconds, trying to catch up to your opponents. Thankfully though, Undercover's AI is built around the lack of perfect start, so it's not like they'll speed up instantly, no, they'll generally start out at pretty much the same pace as you do. NFS Undercover has a multitude of game modes, with a few brand new game modes, never-before-seen in any previous Need for Speed game, or even any sub-sequent games - Jobs & Highway Battles. Briefly about the other game modes - they're standard fare what you'd find in other Need for Speed games - you got Circuit, Sprint, Checkpoint, Outrun (making a return from Underground 2) & Police Events. About those ""exclusive"" game modes, as it were. First - Jobs. Jobs are essentially your character stealing a car & then driving said car to a drop-off point, meanwhile cops are after your♥♥♥♥♥and your goal is to escape the cops & get to the drop off point. This game mode doesn't have a time limit of any sorts, so you can breathe in relief, however - some jobs do have damage meters, which are rather easy to deplete. Highway Battles are sort of glorified high-speed canyon events from Need for Speed Carbon, just with♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of traffic & only 1 stage. The goal in Highway Battle is to get ahead of your opponent & lead by 300 m (or 1000 ft if you're using the Imperial system) whilist trying to not wreck your car with the insane amounts of traffic around you. These 2 exclusive game modes are generally executed very well, with the opponent AI sometimes being crafty enough to try and block your path by purposefully pushing traffic cars into you & they take advantage of every opportunity to overtake you and make your day horrible, should you ♥♥♥♥ up midway in the race. Making a return from Need for Speed ProStreet is domination, but this time - instead of completing an entire area to ""dominate"", dominations are handed out if you can manage to beat the developer time for each race in the game, not counting Jobs. Early game, beating the developer ""domination"" time is quite easy, but later down the road - it gets more & more difficult. For Customization - if you've played ProStreet & seen that game's insanely expansive customization system, then Undercover will bring nothing new and you can jump straight in. But for the new guys? I'll throw it out there right now - customizing your car (other than its performance) does nothing and won't give you any benefits like in ProStreet. They're just there if you want your car to look nicer, but be warned - if you will ever decide to play online (which will happen only if you have someone who plays this game after 7 years), your vinyls that you apply to your car will not be shown. Why? Who the hell knows, but they disabled it. I haven't spent much time in the customization menu myself, so I really can't comment on anything here.Final Verdict & Score:Due to the Steam Review Character limit, the rest of this review is in screenshot format.[puu.sh] "

												About 5+ years ago, I got this on release, and played this on Xbox 360. I hated it. I absolutely thought it was the worst game that could have ever been produced.Recently I bought this at a Steam sale, thinking that I might as well just put down my $5 into some random cheap racing game, hoping it would provide even an hours entertainment. I'm so happy with this purchase. I regret my constant stream of hate.Granted, this is definately not the pinnicle of NFS (Underground 2/Most Wanted 2005 will always be), and that's clear through some poor design desicions regarding the lack of a main menu, the fact you can't change graphics quality until you actually get to play the game (about 5 minutes of cutscenes), and even the fact that there's too much bloom and there's some weird glitches with the lights floating a la Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.But, with all the negatives said and done, this...this is the most fun I've had in a racing game in years. It seems like the devs tried to be as faithful as they could to Most Wanted, while still moving forward with the rest of the game. The cars control FANTASTICALLY on PC compared to console, and the selection of vehicles is awesome, especially considering the Bugatti Veyron (which, gladly thanks to the Master Events balancing the field, isn't game-breaking). The length of the game is awesome, with a huge amount of things to do. The police chases are fantastic, and polished much further than Most Wanted (admittadely though, I'll always prefer the down-right hilariously poor AI of Most Wanted's cops, and their over-the-top voice acting).Overall, this really probably didn't recieve a lot of the backlash it got from fans. If you're a Most Wanted fan who has been disillusioned with the Need for Speed franchise as of late, you can do no harm in buying this game and reliving a time just before Criterion broke everything. And before The Run existed...			"

												In this review I will give you detailed information about the version differences between the Steam and Origin versions of Need for Speed™ Undercover.- First of all, the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover isn't patched and doesn't have the so called ""Challenge Series"" (Origin version does include those!).- Secondly, the Steam version doesn't have lag spikes caused by additional DRM (SecuRom) because this DRM isn't present in the Steam version, but unfortunately it is present in the Origin version of Need for Speed™ Undercover. To get rid of the annoying lag spikes, you have to apply a ""custom"" game fix (v1.0.1.18).- Moreover, the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover doesn't support the ""Steam Community Overlay""… unless you add it as a ""Non-Steam game"" (I know... funny). On the other hand, to be able to use the ""Steam Community Overlay"" while playing the Origin version of Need for Speed™ Undercover, you also have to add it as a ""Non-Steam game"" (note that ""Origin In-Game"" must be disabled so that the ""Steam Community Overlay"" would work when adding Need for Speed™ Undercover Origin version as a ""Non-Steam game"").Additional Notes: When adding the Steam version of Need for Speed™ Undercover as a ""Non-Steam game"", you also have to use a ""custom"" game fix (v1.0) to get pass the error upon launching the game after you have added it as a ""Non-Steam game"".P.S.: Long story short, even though I own the game on both digital platforms (Steam and Origin), I still had to use ""custom"" game fixes to be able to enjoy ~ The Way It was Meant to be Played™ ~ this actually beautiful game!

												Great game! Graphics are amazing for the time it was made, and cars are much easier to get than NFS Carbon. I beat the game in less than 30 hours, and it was great every step of the way. The cutscenes are terrific, gameplay is amazing, everything is perfect. The car customization is one of the best I have ever seen! Would recommend. 10/10 Rating.			"

												Think of this game as the younger, try-hard brother of NFS: Most Wanted (2005).It's like MW, but this time...- Cops don't go airborne when you hit a roadblock- It has oversteer and understeer. And everywhere-steer.- The heat system no longer makes sense- Crashing into traffic still counts as a ""near miss"" (lol)- You can't get cars out of impound- It's got bad music- Physics are somewhat buggy when you do manage to get airborne- Multiplayer servers are completely shut down... however...+ Feels like it's directed by Michael Bay + Cool graphics!+ Visible damage+ Well-paced story+ Not just racing; attempt to ""take down"" (bust) racer criminals+ Extensive list of ""modern"" cars (more or less)+ Minimal menu-stuffing-aroundCool game you can knock off in a short amount of time. Doesn't quite retain the feel of the edgy Most Wanted vibe, but it has its replay value. 7/10			"

												Despite the obvious issues with the game, such as sun glaring into tunnels through the walls and into your eyes, the skyboxes randomly spinning around you, and heavy police SUVs easily outrunning a Veyron, it is a fun game.It's fun, but a bit too easy at times. Almost depressingly easy. So easy, you'd want to keep a lower-leveled car around just to give yourself a challenge.No, seriously. Except for one time some dude in a Dodge Viper challenged me to a 1-on-1 race, I still outran him in a 1969 Camaro. Sure, it took me 20+ tries, but I did it.And finally, children: Don't be afraid to alt+F4 the game if you're about to get arrested and you know you wouldn't be able to afford the impound retrieval costs. It's easier to spend a minute loading the game back up than it is getting enough money to get another car.			"

												I personally enjoyed all that Need for Speed hasto offer over the many years, but this one is one of my all time loves next to of course the Most Wanted-NfS. You are a cop undercover and must be bad to get trusted and so on, but you dont do no boring bad guy stalking stuff, all you really have to do is simply race and run from cops, the game's campain will indeed follow you on its own. Only single downside i didnt like was that there was no acheivments, other then that its near perfect.			"

												One of the most underrated series of nfs.It has lot of cutscenes, and nice storyline to follow on.Only two problem makes this game underrated than it has to be. First problem is the ridiculous difficulty on some races such as I need to beat SLR Mclaren with EVO. But it is not that big because you can get pinkslips as you clear other missions and easily collect money and buy a better car.The biggest problem is physics which breaks the game and makes player difficult or sometimes almost impossible to control the car.But overall great game with big open world, Which is the last nfs with STORY, COPS, TUNE UPS, and FREEDRIVE.See what happened to NFS these days. They are just burnout series with supercars. No more storyline, unique tune ups, and thrills which really suck.간만에 해보는데 뽀샤시한 그래픽, 스토리라인이 좋음 최고의 혹평을 받았던 게임인데 거기서 알수 있듯 굉장한 개적화와 썩은 물리엔진을 보여준다썩은 물리엔진이 혈압을 오르게하지만 기본적으로 뽀샤시한 느낌과 오픈월드가 좋아서  할만은 하다.

The story mode is just what you need it to be,crazy chases, wrecks or just good old racing with long tracks spanning miles on end.

Posted: December 16, 2013
												I bought this game for around 5 bucks and after finishing it I'm not completely, but very disappointed so I give this game a thumb down. Main reason for this: This game has NO replayability and you probably won't even bother to finish it. Reasons see below.First of all: The races and missions are always depending on luck, I guess. Some races / missions are ridiculously easy, some are nearly unbeatable. Sometimes you flee from the police and you're completing the mission in under a minute and the next day you're failing at a similar mission even after ten tries. Especially the high way battles (where you have to stay ahead for x seconds or lead at least for x meters) are unfair beyond belief. Sometimes I thought a race against light itself would be easier.Mission vary from 'Sprint', 'Curcuits', 'Getaways', 'Cop takeouts', 'Causing costs to state' (boring as hell, since you only gain XP, and no money at all) and some missions, where you always have to get away or take out some other drivers.The ""Speed braker"" adds a great deal of fun to it. Which brings me to the fact that, when you hit the wall, you will ALWAYS end up being either stuck exactly when not more than 90° to the wall or completely reserved when you try to accelerate / manouver your way out. After so many hours and races it happened constantly, so I'm sure the makers thought: ""Well, the game is already unfair hard, what else can we do to frustrate a gamer? How about your car gets stuck or completely reserved after hitting a wall in a tiny bend?""And of course, like in every single racing game: ALL other racers are in one place. Meaning when you're at 1st place and you make just a tiny mistake ALL other racers will overtake you and you're last. And believe me, the other racers in the later races are getting REALLY hard and unfair, like hitting your tail and stuff. And guess what? You always have to be 1st, or you won't get any reward. Why didn't they thought of a 2nd or 3rd place, with at least a part of the money to show some appreciation of the time I spent on that race?I also missed an ""Test drive car"" - option before purchasing a car. Wasting a fortune for the Bugatti Veyron (which accelerates like a rocket and steeres harder than a tank with a house on top of it) is kinda disappointing. Oh and don't expect ANY reward for finishing the game, like all cars, bling bling money, a special car, gimmick, anything else etc - you're not getting anything, except closing credits.The tuning system is easy to use and minimalistic, except where you can buy a paint job. Worst. Interface. Ever, if you use a controller. I even had to use keyboard plus controller to do a paint job. Well done, makers, really. Are you satisfied with all the drugs you take?The game gets harder and harder, but not in a challenging, but an ultra-unfair way which will drive you (no pun intended) effin insane. I played half of the game with the first Muscle Car I got via a Pink Slip, until I could afford an Audi Quattro TT. This went good for a while. After I bought the Zonda from Tier 1 I had absolutely NO chance in a race, because I hadn't enough money to buy also both Power and Handling - ""Ultimate"" packs for my car, which all of the other cars obviously had. Frustrating, because I had to go back to my already maxed out Audi and finish a dozen races under my current league until I could afford the upgrades.I also tried to cheat because I nearly smashed my controller through my LCD into the wall. Cheats are absolutely, f-word ridiculous. There is a cheat for 10.000 credits. Nice, eh, typing it in a thousand times and go shopping big time, eh? Nope. It's, like all cheats, a disposable cheat, meaning you only can use it ONCE. Like the game itself. Disposable. So in a game where cars cost about 300.000 credits and not to mention tuning and upgrade packages where you could buy a whole city, 10.000 credits as a disposable cheat ain't just quite cutting the deal. Where they drunk when they made those game plus cheats? No, they were obviously thinking about letting another good franchise going down the drain big time.Oh, and by the way. How can you tell you're playing NFS? After you've reached your maximum speed of ~350km/h, you're gonna be overtaken. By a flying police jeep of two-and-a-half tons. And all other enemies. Speed's just a number, after all, eh?So the longtime-fun is found somewhere else, this game has absolutely no value left after a few races or about maybe ten hours. I now own the Zonda with all upgrades and the races got too hard. Just a single minor mistake or getting hit by another driver (who drive like they're in effin Carmageddon) and you can restart all over. I mean, I'm not a pro gamer, either I'm bad at it, I just want a racing game to be fun, race now and then a few circuits, have fun. And not be frustrated more and more AFTER I have the best equipment in the game and finished it already.Further you get stuck later in the game. I finished the game. Now I own the Paganini Zonda, a Lamborghini Gallardo, an Audi Quattro TT, a Porsche GT2 and a few pink slips from other cars (which can't be sold, just be removed. Sense, please?). The latter missions will earn you 25.000 to 35.000 credits and you will spend it all on cars, upgrades, paint jobs and aftermarket stuff (like spoilers etc). But then, after maybe four, five fully upgraded cars there's no races left (only old ones, which will earn you peanuts of 2.000 credits each or so), but there are still so many cars and upgrades left to try and buy. So when all the missions and races are won, you're gonna be stuck with your five good, maxed out cars. And you will have to start a new game to drive all the other cars. Where are the good old times, when finishing a racing game unlocked the complete car list? I'm not willing to start five new games just to see, drive and have all cars in the game. Here are also some other thoughts:Menues: The menu is very well sorted, tidied up and everything is easy to use, even with a controller. Great! That's how you do it. Bravo.Intros: Couldn't care less about these annoying things and they are not skipable. Cutscenes are skipable, after you've played the mission once.Graphics: Graphics are not important in a game. NFS:U is acceptable, there are games with better and worse graphics. For me (I own an older pc) they were just fine and, like said, of no importance.Story: I couldn't care less about a story in a racing game. I mean, what's the big deal? Car, this is player, player, this is your car. Take the controller, hit the buttons, wipe the floor with your enemies and have fun. Early in the game I muted the volume of ""Voice"" in the menu to 0, because in one mission I had to chase someone and every two seconds a voice said ""Catch on"" or ""Go faster!"", like this wasn't the thing I was doing. Good thing after muting: All cut scenes were muted. So I didn't know what the story was all about but from what I saw the story was more boring, mediocre, filled with not B- but C- and D-movie actors.Overall: For a small price like five to ten bucks it's a great, action packed game to play now and then which will serve a few hours of fun until you experience the things I mentioned in my review.

												This is a NFS game. It's still in the classic vein of games, like the 2005 MW and Carbon and such.The story, as always, is pretty garbage.The cars, as always, look nice.The cutscenes have sexy cars and bangable women, as always.The graphics are shiny, but ugly when you look at it close up, as always.The performance is decent to good in most cases, as always.The controls are responsive and driving feels good, as always.The customization is extensive for the visual aspects and utter linearly progressing dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ as always.The only real new feature is the gradual performance increase you get when completing events. Things like +2% to engines or +20% zone income. Slight things, but they make you feel like you're progressing.It's the standard NFS experience, you know what you're getting into.It's worth it to everyone during a sale. Without one, I'd only suggest this to the most hardcore of NFS fans.Overall, it's a solid 7/10.			"

												This is a very underrated NFS game.  Obviously, it's quite aged, but it is still fun and runs fine on modern hardware, Windows 10, and a Xbox One controller.  The story is cliche, but it's a decent excuse for the racing.  I found the drag race events in traffic completely awesome, and the copper ones are fun.  There's a boatload of rides that are still sexy and fun to upgrade 9 years later.  The driver skill system gives you a little incentive to do all the events too.  On the negative side, the Steam overlay doesn't work, the non-car graphics were subpar even for 2008, and the AI isn't great.  If you're an arcade racer fan, this is still a lot of fun and a worthy addition to your collection.  It may not be Most Wanted, Burnout, or Underground, but it's still a good game.			"

												This game is a bit old, but it is still fun to play. Good simple graphics, not really a high graphic game, but it still alright. This game does not demand a high system requirement to run. In this Need for Speed game you play as an undercover cop, trying to bust an illegal shipment. Feel what it is like to go undercover. You take on mission after mission, such as races, highway battles, and cop takedowns. Using the cash you have aquired through events you can buy new cars and upgrade them. This game does have online multiplayer, that is if you can find someone online or if you have a friend who can play with you online. Would recommend this game to others.			"

												Today,I am going to write a review about one of the most underrated games ever, about  NFS Undercover.	 Story +++	Need for Speed Undercover story is inspired or based at film ""The Transporter"" (original in french - Le Transporteur). However it sounds weird, it is really similar to the film. It fits very well and it gives game ""the right action"". Gameplay -	Step by step.  Driving model is one of the worst in the entire NFS history, but it is easy to learn it. Also there are more cars then in previous NFS games, more newer and faster cars (f.e. - McLaren, Bugatti and Pagani Zonda). Map is really big - there are 3 towns - Capital City, Western Town (or Town of Desert) and Suburb (or sth like that). About the city traffic... well the cars are like meteors - appears in middle of nowhere.  Graphics -	Graphics are really okay for the year 2008, however the car crash model is worse then in Need for Speed Most Wanted (2005). It feels more paper, the police cars cant get dmg that is seenable. Car design is pretty good, but not as good as in Most Wanted. And the biggest problem? The EA company absolutely doesnt give a f*ck about the dead parts. Like sometimes you can run through cars, objects or even spikes and it doesnt do anything.  Other +	+ working multiplayer+ cheap game (at♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)+ worth play again&again- low community (not many people) THE VERDICT	Need for Speed Undercover is great game with lovely story, but with lot of graphics/gameplay problems. Its still with working multiplayer and it is really easy to get it cheap, so definitely I recommend this game.  67%	 "

												NFS:UC is another game in the NFS franchise, and features some pretty good police chase mechanics (evolved somewhat from NFS: Most Wanted) and some pretty high production value live action videos to set the scene, starring Maggie Q as your ""handler"", Chasey Lynn. You're going undercover by infiltrating a bunch of street racers who's obviously also up to no good. However, your ""boss"" may be up to no good herself... The cities are large, roads are wide, and there are plenty of chase-breakers as well as shortcuts and whatnot. There are 4 classes of cars, from regualr sports to superexotics, and 3 levels of upgrades for each. There are variety of races, from simple circuit to highway battle (get away from the other driver once you're in the lead), from knockout (last place is eliminated) to eliimination (crash target until he's disabled), from timed delivery (take this hot car to destination, no cops!) to cop challenges (take out 5 cop cars then escape), there are a variety of missions to accomplish, using wide variety of cars, all over the major areas of this city. While the production values are high, and chases can get exciting, the videos come out as a bit... hokey, and the final battle is quite lame. Some of the missions are freaking impossible by game's end as the cars are driving insanely fast, almost beyond human reflexes. Graphics are decent but not spectacular as this is an older game. All in all, NFS:UC is not quite as good as the original Most Wanted, but the new mission and race types are welcomed. The subsequent iterations, such as Hot Pursuit (3) and ""The Run"" attempt to capture the magic, but you'll have to read those reviews elsewhere.			"

												It has plot and this is what I like in NFS games.Also it has sensitive control if compare with latest NFS games.One thing you should know - you should follow story and complete story tasks first.If you will finish all available tasks and after that will follow the story you will have to repeat races and tasks you have finished again.

												There's a good bit of variety and a fair story to go along withe driving, even if it is a bit short. You can choose to drive from race to race, which I find one of the best aspects of these games.Graphics are smooth and, because of its age, it will probably work on even cheap modern hardware.			"

												----DONT BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTI ONLY----i will be using nfs most wanted 2005 and nfs carbon as reference to review undercover (a lot) and thanks to my friend i played it again and this time i finished it .-so first of all if you already played nfs mw 2005 or carbon you'll understand how this game work very fast , the plot is not the best in the world but kinda entertaining , you play as undercover cop trying to take down car thieves and smugglers ,plot twist here and there ( real actors just like in MW 2005 and carbon) you can get 15h if you play only the main compagne.-big well detailed city to play and explore but it feels so lifeless , you just drive with no purpose except the races .-graphicly is much better then MW and carbon cause they didnt port this one from the ps2 version like they did with carbon (8 years and still looking good ) and dont try the hd texture pack on the steam version it wont work-voice acting is really good just like in the previous nfs games , perfect sound effect , but shity soundtracks ( the worst soundtrack in a nfs game yet )-gameplay is smouth and 2 new type race, Highway Battle (my fav) and stealing cars .but sadly no steam fetures like steam chat in game and screenshot .-the multiplayer was dead 5 years ago (EA shut down the servers since 2011) so if you want to buy this game just for the multi dont do it )i recommend this game to gamers that want some nostalgia cause it feels just like MW2005 but with updates7/10			"

												I wish there was a ""Maybe"" option when it comes to recommending games, because it would be very useful right now.Short Version:If you've played Most Wanted (the 2005 one, not the utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥remake) like me; you'll probably not enjoy this game that much.If you haven't played MW; You'll most likely enjoy the game.More In-Depth:Story: Honestly, not really gonna care about story, since this a NFS game. Nobody has really cared about the story in racing games. So let's just skip to the most important part.Gameplay: Basically, this where the comparisons to MW come from. The controls are nice to drive, even with a keyboard, but compared to MW, it feels wonky almost. Especially the Speedbreaker, in MW, SB is very smooth when used and glides in and out. In UC though, it feels like the whole game just stops instantly with no flow. One thing this game DOES have over MW is the drifting. Drifting feels very fluid and nice to pull off. When it comes to speed, you feel fast, but, of course, compared to MW, it feels sluggish.UI: Ok, this is the first complaint with the game that isn't because of MW. The UI with a keyboard is just an♥♥♥♥♥to use. It feels very awkward and frustrating to try and flick through the menus.Cars: Another(and probably the last) thing UC has over MW is the cars. UC comes with an assload of cars with this kind of racing game. Ranging from muscle cars to exotics to tuners, this game has almost it all.Again I'll say it once and I'll say it again, If you've played MW, stay away, if not, go ahead, it's only $10.			"

												OK, here we go!First of all - STORY. Well, it is an excuse for racing. I am not going to go into details of it but in a nuttshell it is just as this-cutscene: ""Hey you! This and that happened, you have to race in order to bla bla!"" Like all the other games of this type you can not expect it to have some great story. What I am impressed by is the live action cutscenes. Maggie Q and the bunch are actually making an effort here. Don't get me wrong it is not like movie level acting but it is not like those in Most Wanted (the original one) where the acting was so bad that I cringed while watching. The Carbon actors did a good job on that game but here they took it to another level. And, c'mon, who doesn't like to see some of Maggie Q's boobs and legs (bit of Maggie Q bias here). OK, moving on! Gameplay! Oh, man! I don't know if I should laugh or cry. Here is where I got dissapointed big time. But I am getting ahead of myself. First of all- car list, one word-AWESOME! You get American, European and Japanese cars stacked in these cathegories and each contains the best of the chategory. The list is big, I wont get into all the cars. You can look them up on-line. They handle OK but I can not shake the feeling that the cars have no mass to them. It feels like I'm driving an RC car. The movements are cartoonish and sometimes I get the fieeling that I'm playing Mario Cart. There is none of that speed feeling that I used to get in Underground 2 or in Most wanted. NPC cars are a whole other story, they are able of quantum leap, turning 90° while going 250 kph and the worst driver in the race suddenly becomes awesome and just wizzes by you when you are just about to win. Police chases play a role in the game but not all that much. These bring their own set of surprises like Police SUVs that take on and subdue a Bugatti Veyron doing 350+ kph on a highway like it was nothing. Sometimes I got the feeling that I was playing a demolition derby rather than racing with them raming me like crazy. The one thing that made me angry the most were bugs. And there are a lot of them in the sence that it is a marketed product that somebody made money off. Invisible walls that my car ran into, jumping off in the air in the middle of the road from some kind of an invisible ramp and the grand daddy of them all-on the last mission my car fell through the texture and fell into nothingnes. This is where i went crazy. This game is a product like any other that was marketed as a functioning one. It chrashed on me a couple of times  (I have no idea why) but when my carr did the falling down into oblivion that was it for me. I would understand that if the copy of a game was....well... obtained as a leaked product. But I payed money for it and I expect it to work properly. In the end it feels like it is a rush job. I really want to meet the guy/gal who signed off the product as a good one so I can have some words with them about false advertizing. On the plus side the game runs on a toaster so you don't have to worry about your computer being too old and weak. You should always check the system requierments before purchasing but if you bought your machine in the last 5-8 years you should be good. The last but not hte least-car customizing engine is great and specially for the visual part. Performance has the standard kind of bussiness but they really made an effort in order to give you some really good options for making your ride stand out. The world looks good. It feels like your are racing in a big city but I could not help but feel that it is a huge construction site. So many construction cranes!!!! One other thing I noticed (in the start of the game, later is lost track) that you are racing a couple of same racers, wich makes sense. In the previos games I had the feeling that the town I was racing in had like half a milion residents and every school kid and nursing home grandpa, mom and dad, dog, cat were racing. Soundtrack- As a huge music fan (bigger than gaming) I must say that the track list is good and I discovered ome good bands while playing the game. Dear reader! I am not a serious gamer. So this review should not influence your decision of buying the product. By all means take a look at other reviews - there are some good ones by more expirienced gamers. My conclusion: Do I recommend the game......well....I have no idea. As I'm writing this sentence I am trying to figure out if I'll give it a thumbs up or down. There are good features of the game but I feel like they are outweight by the bad ones. If you are someone who is a casual gamer like me you might enjoy the game. But if you are a serious gamer with developed taste in games then I would not recommend it. Personally....I'll keep it installed for some more of the time so i can customize rides. :-D I think I'm giving it a thumbs down. Sorry EA!			"

												So I replayed this after some years passed, and as an avid NFS-Fan of the older titles, I wrote this review.Gameplay, World and Story:Good:» The open world, while boring looking, has many alternative paths and offroad-streets.» Good choice of cars (although I wish there were more older japanese vehicles).» Great modification (visual upgrades are on the same level as NFS:Pro Street).» Gameplay is very similar to the likes of NFS:Most Wanted and NFS:Carbon.Bad:» Horrible driving physics: Cars feel washy and oversteer at the same time, it's just weird.» Crashing into cops isn't as exciting as in Carbon/Most Wanted.» The in-game camera feels off (it sways weirdly).» Open world looks boring and uninspired.» Generic cutscenes.» Braindead Cop-AI.Misc:Settings:The game comes with a lot of settings. World details, car details and so on can be changed. However, the game does not support high resolutions such as 4K. The game has an immense amount of bloom, which can be turned off, but the game just looks ugly without it. I would also recommend turning on Vsync, as menus with sliders can glitch out on fast systems.Performance:Pretty good FPS on a modern system. Slight stutters.Summary:If some of the issues didn't exist (especially the driving-physics problem), it could've been a great game. I can only hope for some mod to fix this game in the future. But until then, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, even if you happen to get it for free.I returned my copy.Hey EA you money-bag, wanna make some easy dollar? How about putting up the older NFS titles for sale? I'd buy 'em. kthxbye "

												Need For Speed Undercover. Intended to be a true successor to Most Wanted (The 2005 version...not Burnout Paradise 2), this game has received its fair share of hate and throughout all of these years, i never understood why to be perfectly honest. After the less then stellar Pro Street, i was extremely hyped for this game at the time and when i played it, initially i thought it was an absolute blast and lived up to Most Wanted in every way. But again, that was in 2008. How does the game hold up to today's standards?Well. Suprisingly well id say. Its not even close to how good i thought it was back in the day (Bare in mind, this was back when i loved racing games and i was a Total NFS fanboy) but its still a pretty exciting racer and the hate it received wasnt exactly what it deserved. It truly was the last TRUE Need For Speed, before the series would become Burnout (Hot Pursuit was basically Takedown, MW2012 is Paradise 2, as stated). That being said, lets get a few things out of the way. If your expecting a truly engaging story with memorable characters, unexpected plot twists and perfect pacing with pitch perfect acting...then just stop, like seriously. The story is completely disjointed and random. Stuff happens for no reason and characters come and go without any rhyme or reason. And the cutscenes...my god...the dialogue is without a doubt completely unbearable. Most Wanted and Carbon were cheesy, but in a way that gave it style. Here, it just feels forced...that or these people cant write or act at all. A particular character, Rose, is without a doubt the worst. Her dialogue is just the worst ive heard in awhile. Suffice to say, im sad that the story failed. The idea of being deep undercover of some kind of crime syndicate always intrigued me and EA couldve really did something here.Anywho, enough of the story. The racing and cop chases are where this game strive off of and i feel that while its not at the heights of Most Wanted, its still good enough that you can see yourself having allot of fun with this game. The sense of speed is crazy, and the car handling is less torpedo like and allows you to casually cut corners like a pro, which goes really far into making you feel like a real bad♥♥♥♥♥ The courses are layered out with plenty of ways to overcome other racers and you always feel like you have a chance even if the race isnt going good. Then the police chases, which is one of my personal favorite mission types, are just pure intensity, particularly when your Wheelman level goes up and the odds against you get higher and higher. Also, i love the small touch of being able to press a single button to hop into another race on the spot. It allows you to simply hop into a match without surfing into map screens and i for one love the small touch. The game is extremely easy to run too. Throwing it on max settings shouldnt be too difficult and 60FPS isnt going to be far from reach either.This might be a preference thing, but the keyboard controls are Meh at best. You can totally work with it, as i found it atleast playable...but if you have a 360 Remote laying about, or any other form of Gamepad, id highly reccomend using it. The game feels much more slick this way and it really pays off.Now for the things i didnt like. The AI is inconsistent to say the least. In races, expect to always see the opponents lag MILES behind you. Even towards the end of the game, this happens pretty often. Im under the assumption that you could EASILY beat this game with the starter vehicle, which is kindda sad. Then theres the ""Master Races"" which is the perfect showcaser of why the series frequent use of Rubber Banding is a joke. You literally have to ensure you make NO mistakes...yet even when your doing perfect, someone will be glued to your♥♥♥♥♥like a Magnet and side swipe you when your close to victory. You can try to rear end them but they stay glued to the road as you plumet to the side of the road in shame. At these moments, i really wish we had the progression of Need For Speed Most Wanted, where the game got more and more difficult as you made your way down the blacklist. Hell, even Carbon with its Rubbery AI had a feeling of progession. As for the cop chases...they have issues too. Dont get me wrong, they are still fun, but the Police are just too forgiving. Cops often stand back, allowing you to easily out run them, and even in the higher intervals, they give you space to escape being boxed in. Also for whatever reason, they eventually call off all their units after awhile, abruptly ending a chase. The only thing that really gets you off guard is the Spike Strips, but thats only because you never even really see them.In the end, the game is definetly flawed. But id say its worth it. Especially now that its cheap and easily attainable through Steam. The racing is fun, and the chases can be a blast. The awful story and Inconsistent difficulty drag it down but nowhere near to the levels of a bad game. Its a solid racer and if your looking for something to play, look no further. PERSONALLY though, if you still have a Playstation 2 or a Nintendo Wii (Or a Wii U even), id reccomend hunting down a copy of Need For Speed Undercover on one of those consoles. It may not be the prettiest versions, but the AI is much better and consistent, the cars feel and handle better, the cop chases are a challenge and it just overall just feels more like a Most Wanted sequel then this version does.

It was  quite similar to the first Test Drive unlimited, tohugh with slightly better graphics in that you could wander aroun the   large area covering  several smalll towns  and  pick up missions as and when you felt like it.  It's well worth picking up  when Steam have one of their sales.  you'll probably get it  for  a few pounds.

												Good single player game, multiplayer sucks♥♥♥♥♥ origin is lame and finding and playing with friends in nigh on impossible, I give it a bad review just for this spent 3~ hours messing with firewall settings and router setting and still can't play with my mates,i sign in ok to EA nations (origin) but i can't create or join any games.If you want a single player driving game it's OKbut don't expect any help from EA or origin as i tried to contact origin for help via on-line help desk and gave up after 2~ hours wait.Love NEED FOR SPEED but the support and on-line stuff is run by blind and stupid people.

												This game is... more enjoyable than NFS:MW 2012, which I spent like $60 when it came out because of the MW name, and I hate it so much.Undercover is a game that gives you a feeling that they rushed too hard during development, so it lacks testing, refinement, and thoughts. It carries quite a few promises, but is very disappointing.Pros:1. Fast-paced action easily makes one EXCITED!2. A good collection of cars.3. A nice world to roam about.4. Cut-scenes are quite well made.5. Chances are that you buy this game when it's on sale, very cheap.Cons:1. Physics is ridiculous, when crash happens, all cars seem to have infinite mass. Mario Kart has better physics and makes more sense. NFS is not famous for physics accuracy, but this game is way too off-scale.2. If you drive manual, you will easily feel that the cars' torque-rev relationship is pretty ridiculous.3. Brake is so ridiculously powerful, and the car has ridiculous amount of grip.4. They hired Maggie Q and others to make nice movies, so it seems that they focused on SP. However AI is ridiculous. Anything controlled by AI just makes no sense.5. AI racers seem to be ""given"" speed and accleration. Sometimes I can have 200 feet in the lead and I am faster round the last corner, but the second car just acclerates ridiculously and robs my first place. It feels that those cars do not have actual drivers in them.6. Roaming traffic cars are quite amazing, not only AI racers ram you like crazy, those roaming traffic cars also ram into you for no reason at all.7. There's almost no balance between cars and missions. You can win by miles using Lotus Elise against some really slow Volkswagen, and at some other locatons you will face Audi R8, Gallardo, and many other cars that are way faster. BTW Lotus Elise is extremely overpowered.8. I can't believe how bad the cops are. They seem to give up chasing you as long as you are 100 inches ahead of them. Sometimes it can be extremely hard to complete missions like cost-to-state challenge, because the cops do not chase you at all, even you are at heat level 5.9. You can easily use the TAB key to fast travel to just jump right to the next race, so although there's a huge amazing open world, chances are that you don't even roam about at all.10. Graphics are okay for a game this old, and it uses similar color scheme as the original NFS:MW. However it looks a lot less attractive than NFS:MW for some reason.11. Road surface is modeled quite badly. Different road surface (asphalt, grass, dirt, etc) feels quite similar, and the only difference seems to be the smoothness.12. Its compatibility with controllers has lots of problems. If I have my keyboard, XBOX360 controller, and my Logitech G27 all connected at the same time, the car will keep steering to the right, and the menu cursor keeps going down.13. The cars' performace has little to do with their real-life version.Conclusion:If this game is on sale, and if you want some excitment road racing, and if you are not good at braking in racing games, pick this up. It can make you blood boil (Rush-time High Way Battle is the best mode in this game IMO), and it does not require too much skill.			"

												It was actually pretty fun, despite how everyone says it isn't as good, it is still a great game to play, racing in it just feels pretty fun. My Carrera GT looks pretty awesome as well. The soundtrack was pretty good as well, just great racing game music, you know. I just wish there was more races because I dominated all of them, so the game is kinda short. The story is kinda boring, but I just ignored it and raced more. And the map is pretty big, takes you quite a while to explore all of it. The only thing that annoyed me is that the police can impound your car, I had to buy another Carrera GT because of that. So just don't get arrested and you should be good. lol. It is pretty easy to race once you've gotten a fully upgraded tier one car. Also the tier system is reversed compared to carbon, 1 is fastest and 4 is slowest, so don't get confused. So basically, its fun to race in, easy after you get a tier 1 car fully upgraded, avoid getting arrested as you only have 3 strikes, and the map is pretty big. Cool, if you buy it, maybe you can message me, we can race sometime.			"

												The NFS Undercover, in my opinion, is one of the darkest parts of NFS series. It isn't popular for multiple reasons, but that doesn't mean that this game doesn't have any strong sides.Advantages:+Good story - you are playing a cop working undercover. Your mission - find out who is responsible for stealing the cars from the port. Your tactic - infiltrating. You are not good or bad, you can't get help, you are on your own.+Variety of cars - 80 of them, separated in 4 classes+Customisation - make your car look cool by using lots of kits (5 actually), rims, spoilers, exhaust, paint types and decals+Atmosphere - the game has an atmosphere of Most wanted+Big, bright and nice world+Tracklist - 55 great tracks?Graphics - it is...O.K.Disadvantages:-Gameplay & Physics - cars feel very heavy, they have an INSANE grip and brake power. If you expect this game to be realistic, you will be very disappointed. It's not even arcade, it's something worse. And that's the main reason why people hate this game.			"

												Very good game! Good storyline, good sound good game.Despite when it crashes (Windows 7 + dual screen)The graphics can be set kinda high, but the graphics mod is better. The mod includes Higher detail reflections, hd tires smoke,  hd landcsaping and road. The cars alltogether are amazing! Wide selection of cars, colour wise not to sure about that the red looks like pink! but all the other colours are fine! Races are realy good the fact that the traffic is still there when you are racing is very realistic, cop simulation is kinda dodgy though they say the wrong things all the time, like 'suspect is driving a pink car' acually red!

												Honestly... when I first played this game, I had a great time. Usually I don't enjoy playings games without friends, but this one kept me busy for hours on end. The racing controls, even for a keyboard, are amazing. Most racing games on a PC with keyboard and mouse are frustrating, but this one is satisfying. It's not some Triple A game, and it shouldn't be compared with those sorts of games. It does what it does very well. A lot of people say the story is bad, but the story really isn't all that important in this game. It's about racing, and I feel like the story is just there to give you a reason to be racing. I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for time to kill. It's no masterpiece, but it can be a lot of fun.			"

												dull &boring but enjoyable car racing game. predictable plot, not a whole lot that's original, races are very easy 2win on the 1st try. cops don't do much other than bang on your car and yell at you, and after a while they sort of fade away on their own. the game lets you instantly jump to the closest race, which i think provides a good incentive to make it through race after race.

												I purchased this game with the expectation it would be similar to need for speed most wanted - Buy a car, Buy upgrade parts, Evade the police, win races, progress the story - that is pretty much what I got.The reviews here on steam complain about how the car handles & the motion blur effect. The easist way to solve the car handling problem is to use a controller - some computer games are better suited to a controller while others are better suited to the standard keyboard & mouse. A controller makes it easer to adapt to the way the cars handle.As for the motion blur - I got used to it fairly quickly. According to google the game was released on November 18, 2008 - which makes it approximately 6 years old as I type this - and If I not mistaken motion blur was a 'feature' of older games used to make thinks look faster. This is speaking from prior experience, from recent memory I have beaten both need for speed most wanted & need for speed carbon (@#$% the final race in carbon) and they had a similar effect when using nitros.The biggest issue I had with the graphics - I was playing with everything as high as it would go, with the exception of using 1920x1080 due to my screen - and found the lense flair / sun glare to be near blinding. Honestly, more of an annoyance thean anything.I did also find the music tracks to be somewhat repeative, though I was to lazy to figure out how to turn it off. Something in the options menu I would expect.I didn't bother with multiplayer, I think the servers were taken down a while ago and I have no idea if this has any other types of multiplayer avalible.On the subject of the games difficulty - I found the artificial intelligence of the racers to be reasonable, difficult to beat if you are driving an underpowered car and / or didn't understand that you need to turn corners and avoid traffic to win. Yhe police artificial intelligence works well enough, through its nowhere near as effective as what was in need for speed most wanted, and they seemed to be able to keep up with me and even pass me despite driving waht appears to be lower tier cars - I'm guessing thats to give a fighting chane against a human player.TL;DRValue: DecentGraphics: DecentAudio: DecentMultiplayer: Maybe DeadDifficulty: Easy to Medium			"

												This game is like no other need for speed it changes the gameplay, style and, somtimes even pace. Here are some pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Great Gameplay.-Good Graphics that have aged pretty good.-A nice car selection.-A fair storyline.Cons:-AI doesnt feel like it is trying in most races or pursuits but some missions can be very challenging.-The Story feels very short (but is an ok story overall).-a lot of races feel recylced.-There is not to much replayabilty in this game .Other Thoughts-The games soundtrack is ok but not quite as good as some other need for speed games.-There is a fair amount of cusomization in this game with the inclusion of AutoSculpt from Need For Speed Carbon however there is not neon or any trunk audio and fine (Mostly unimportant) customization like in Underground and Underground 2.-There is not a strong modding comunitiy like there is for games like high stakes so dont expect to many (If any) overhauls for this game however there is always a some car addons out there.This game has alot of personality to it, however may that be from the random (and sometimes comical) Police radio chatter or even just some cheesy cutscenes or music choices which add some real charecter to the game. In conclusion I think this game is about a 9/10 there is definitely ways this game could have been better but overall its a solid game and for the price you can't really go wrong. If you are on the fence about it I would recomend waiting for a sale.			"

												While it may not be one of the more memorable NFS games, Undercover has a strange charm of its own. Making use of it's free roam feature, Undercover allows players to race, evade cops and set lap times on various points on the map. The various amounts of events may seem entertaining at first but loses it's appeal quickly. The races are dull and it becomes very easy to have a significant lead over the other racers. The color palette is obsolutely atrocious. Everything is painted in a dull brown which makes every corner and straight seem the same. There is a story component but it's easily forgettable unless you're a fan of Maggie Q. My advice would be to avoid this game and look elsewhere for a memorable NFS experience.			"

												Im going to start off by saying yes it is an old need for speed game but it's graphics are good even stannding up today and it makes me keep playing the game but lets get to the gameplayThe gameplay can be slow at times but the game makes up for it through all the type off things/races you can do. You could go from going to escaping the cops to a highway battle to making your car better and it goes on and on. The cars are even cool to look at even when not fully customized the graphics on high makes everything better.The graphics are amazing. I know the last good new graphic was advanced warfare on the ps4 but graphics cant make up for gameplay but the graphics here are good even to me. Say you played advanced warfare then played this game on all high and you would say wow because it stands out for a racing game which is amazing but if your thinking to buy this for $5.00 do it.

												Overall, an enjoyable game.Not a true NFS game, though.But an enjoyable one.Almost all races are unbelievably easy - I completed the game about 23 hours in. One race I was dragged sideways, giving the leader a 15 second lead and 40% left on the course, and I still caught up. The storyline is probably acceptable, although those cutscenes did have an air of that slightly high-end porn that you occasionally find when you dig deep enough. Fair amount of cars, with a decent range of classic American muscles, although the way to the Mazda MX7 and Lotus Elise. As a rule of thumb when buying cars, get ones with good handling. T4/3; Lotus Elise T2: Lamborghini Gallardo T1: Anything but the Veyron, which goes like the clappers and handles like a dead pig with no legs and a massive erection.Would not recommend buying at full price, but if it's on sale, and you're looking for a little bit of casual racing, get it.

												Really cool to be able to go back and play this game, i remember playing it on my PS2 with one of my mates, the pc version is a bit buggy, but im sure the PS2 version had the same problems. Honestly can't remember since i was around 9 when i played it on the ps2, but whatever, doesn't matter. If you haven't played this game before i probably wouldn't recommend it to you since it's made in 2008 and isn't really living up to what games should be nowadays. But if you originally played this game when it came out, then i would definently recommend you it for the nostalgia.			"

												This game is really worth checking out there is a very good surprise ending I thoroughly enjoyed the game and after 17.3 hours of gameplay since about 2 I think was intro stuff not sure how much but I know at least 17.3 was spent playing the story and I know i'm not done with the game still the only thing I hate is how even with damage set to high that parts can't fail except by scripted events the engine is understandable but the other parts would be fun to see.
