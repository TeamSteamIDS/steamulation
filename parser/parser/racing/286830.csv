												Boring, a waste of money and it has not a single one of the nice aspects of the old Hard Truck Apocalypse titels in it. A shame.			"

												HTA Arcade is an attempt to dumb down the original Hard Truck Apocalypse (aka Ex Machina) into an arcade shoot-em-up. However, it does not support controller, and the keyboard/ mouse controls are horrible. The game is also extremely unbalanced, and there's NEVER enough heal. The in-game purchases to improve your trucks are EXTREMELY expensive, and lack of savepoints or checkpoints make the entire game extremely frustrating. You're much better off playing the actual HTA, not the arcade game.			"

												Tried a variety of different workarounds to get this to run on Win10-64.It doesn't0/10Let's see if I can get this POS to 2 hours to get the cards.Avoid unless your still on a Windows XP machine.Update:Don't know how but I got it running.  Win 8 compat, reinstall, no other tweaks.Don't touch anything if you get to the intro vid.  Takes about 3 min but you'll get into the game.For the love of god, DO NOT TAB OUT OR IT WILL LOCK YOUR SYSTEM.Pro:Fun driving a APVEasy controls WASDCardsLow system specsCon:♥♥♥♥♥ to get runningVery datedGets boring fastOverall:5/10 +1 cards, +1 APV, -5 ♥♥♥♥♥ to get working = 2/10Would play if it was free and I wanted to shoot stuff with an armoured vehicle that can drown in water in 3 seconds. Fun for 5-10 min, then sucks. At this point it's less of a game and more of a frustration / steam card generator.			"

												Screenshots are from original Ex Machina not the Arcade. Arcade have only one car and a small number of upgrades. Missions are long, repetative and boring. Physics are stupid, graphics are aweful. Tornados in second mission made me delete the game because they make it almost unplayable. Avoid unless on a huge sale and you want cards.			"

												This game is significantly unlike the other two HTA games on steam.  It is much narrower in scope and to me, much less interesting.  I like the other two games enough to tolerate the bugs and mayhem but this one is just not recommendable.			"

												This game locked up my system on the first attempt to load, and only successfully started after a second attempt. I really do not care for the way this game runs, and I would advice people to hold off until the bugs are worked out.BTW, I could never get HTA Ex Machina to load, and because I haven't played it for a minimum of five minutes, I cannot write a review of trhe game.

												If I could get the program to start, I might be able to review it. But it fails to launch with the error ""App already running"". Am trying to trouble shoot, but the Steam error corrections are not confidence inspiring. When I played the game before, it had troubles with XP as well and would not start. In its current form, I cannot recomment this game.			"
