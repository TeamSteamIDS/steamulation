												A great, beautiful, and wonderful game. Playing this game is very fun and one of the fastest way to kill time but; this game does get boring. I would recommend buying this game when it's on sale.			"

												9,99€ for the same content that is on the mobile version which is available for $2? And also, the problem with the randomization is still here in the PC version. It's fun and fast but frustrating when you encounter a wall you cannot avoid because of the randomization. + mouse cursor is always visible while playing, but you can't even play with the mouse. The game was made in Unity....the code for removing the mouse cursor is only one line long. ( Cursor.visible = false; )			"

												Who wants a review from a die hard Super Hexagon fan? Well look right here.I have 100+ seconds in every level on Super Hexagon so beating the first two levels in Unpossible was pretty easy already. There's only three real levels and trying to beat them when you're super experienced at Super Hexagon and Open Hexagon makes completing the game a breeze. I was able to complete this game relatively quickly. Now the LAST level was pretty difficult in my own opinion and pretty fun, but I didn't like the rings that made you rotate around that cylinder liked wire looking thing that you're always rotating around. It was basically a test of ""How long can I tap the left/right arrow key without messing up"" rather than ""How well can I react based on reflex."" I also really dislike how I can't use a mouse instead of a keyboard but that's just my preference.Compared to other rage quit games (Super Hexagon, Velocibox, and Geometry Dash for examples)... This game, as I have stated, only has three levels. It's great graphic wise and has good soundtracks, but I find myself unable to enjoy this game for very long. However, I do like how you are able to manipulate the sensitivity of your screen's rotation as other rage quit games don't allow for such a feature. Honestly, not the greatest of games that taxes your reflexes like others do... But not the worst. You can surely wait for a sale before buying this game.			"

												First, this game is fun, if you enjoy super hexagon and reflex games you might like this game. But there is a major problem with it: the course curves randomly.""Why is that a problem?"" You ask.The reason is it's unfair, at times you don't have the ability to see what's coming fast enough to react. The obstacles can be hidden behind the course, or other obstacles, until you are right on top of them.Now I'm not the best when it comes to reflexes (I have yet to beat Hexagonest in Super Hexagon) but I am aware that despite my disabilities in the area, Super Hexagon is fair, you can ALWAYS see what's coming in time to avoid it. This game is not fair, since it advertises itself as fair, I cannot give it a positive review.			"

												While I kind of like this game it's really not worth the ten dollars. It doesn't need much content to be a good example of it's class, that being an endless runner, but it's really not worth ten dollars. Give it a miss unless it comes up on sale.			"

												Pretty cool game until you realize you're going to spend most of your time dying to an inability to see an upcoming wide obstacle properly, whether it's from spinning through a tunnel that obstructs your vision or being forced to the outside of the track so you can barely see what's coming over the ""hill.""Even with the miserable visibility, it took 30 minutes to reach the last level. Not a great lifespan.The music isn't too bad if you're into this genre, so if you're willing to drop a couple bucks to chill out with a fairly easy game it's okay. If you're looking for a challenge, get Velocibox instead.Oh, and the mouse cursor disappears seemingly at random in the menu. Really annoying.			"

												A pretty fun and nice-looking reflex game. It has 3 modes of difficulty: Simplicity, Futile, and Ultra, and every time you play,  the stage is more or less random with obstacles placed in a different pattern. You do get some types of obstacles more common in one difficulty than another, but their placement and pattern often varies. Your goal is to last as long as you can.For each difficulty level you also get a special daily stage. This stage only changes after every 24 hours, so if you're not a fan of the randomness aspect, you can always play the daily stage and try to memorize your way through it.There isn't much else that this game offers, so my only critique so far is that it needs more content, perhaps in a form of more game modes (not necessarily difficulty, but just different goals), but what it does have is pretty fun if you fancy to test your reflexes, precision, and decisiveness, and it costs hardly anything.

A wicked soundtrack that is coupled together with high speed gameplay that is going to keep ypou addicted as you aim for the highest time possible. It is very much similar to Audiosurf so prepare to get addicted from the get go!

												Unpossible is a minimalistic yet very addictive and fun reflex game.I personal really like the style of Unpossible, simple but beautiful. Also thanks to the style of the game, you never lose your overview on what obstacles are ahead of you. The game never gets unfair. If you fail, it’s always your fault.It’s just a press on the spacebar to start another try, and from the first minute on you have this “I can do it, I can beat my time” The game offers you 3 different difficulty’s to choose from. If you like this kind of game, you can’t make much wrong for the little price of just 3€. "

												The game has a nice atmosphere by having nice graphics and soundtracks. But i find out pretty fast that, there are things you can easy avoid and some things which are impossible to avoid, because you cant see where you need to be at next and as soon as you can see it, its too late and you get destroyed. No idea once more again, like in all the other games, what the developer was thinking by doing this mistake.There are 3 levels of difficulty:SimplicityFutileUltraAnd each one has a random and a memory based distance. The memory based distance changes each day.			"

												The idea of the game is very simplistic. Player should avoid obstacles while moving along its path. It's kinda like Wipeout Zone mode, but only without Zones.The idea is very fun. However, there comes couple some catches you wouldn't want this game.1. There is no progression. Your path is just the same 10 seconds, 60 seconds or 300 seconds into the game, so eventually it becomes boring.2. There are literally no settings. No sound volume, no screen resolution selection (thanks god it picks up your current desktop resolution), no windowed mode. I do understand why it's fine for a mobile game, but it's totally not fine for a PC game.3. The game plays very good with a controller. But... there are no support for a controller in a main menu. So the game is over (and it will happen quite often) you have to lean for your mouse.4. Achievements page opens steam browser, which causes your mouse cursor to disappear. And since you need it to start a new game, things become a little problematic.This might not be much, but it really breaks experience. Got the game for like 1$, still is not worth it. I'll prbably leave the game on a follow list, and will buy it again if I get like 75% discount, or those issues will be patched.			"

												This game's price is lowered by the updateand the more difficult level was added.I think they are great developers.*The following text is an old review*I played for 35 hours by Super Hexagon at 3 dollars.I played for 110 hours by Velocibox at 5 dollars.I played for 5 hours by Unpossible at 10 dollars. And I have lost interest in this game...I like this game's concept, but it has very few stages.I want about 5 more high difficulty level stages.簡単で全ステージ一日でクリア出来てしまう。全然unpossibleじゃない爽快感はあるがボリュームがあまりに少なく10ドルの価値はない実績に関しては、日替わりステージ（障害物のパターンが1日固定のステージ）を30日間クリアしろとかいうくっそやりがいがなく退屈な実績があるランキングで競うにしてもVelociboxかHexagonの方が楽しいと思うと思ってたらアップデートで値段が下がって難しいレベルも追加されたこれはおすすめするしかない			"

												after reading the reviews and seeing some negative and some positive and watching gameplay. I decided to try it. I ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT! :D Throw some epic dubstep on and just rip through the game. Quite possibly the best 10 bucks ive spent in a while xD. I hope this game comes out with either DLC or updates (updates perfably :D) To change the color of the levels to like Red or Green or just a custom color option. I could see this game having a multiplayer aswell with like a 10 min timer and have like interlooping tracks with you and the other player and at the end of the 10 mins see who has the better time just for fun. I hope the devs read this and think about it! Id be one hell of a happy person. if this game had multiplayer id buy it for my friends and have a crap ton of fun. But as the game stands im still really happy with my purchase reguardless.			"

												Having played this game on my cellphone for quite some time I was happy to purchase it for pc as well. It is a good game and excels for wasting a few minutes of time should your mind find boredom waiting for other tasks to complete. Unpossible is simple to pick up yet difficult to master, requiring strong, constant concentration to avoid collisions. For its tron-esque appearance and addictive gameplay style I give it an 8.5/10.I have compiled a brief list of my thoughts/ideas for improving either your play or perhaps the game itself. They are suggestions so take them with a grain of salt. It’s Unpossible that 100% of my ideas are good.1. Have a 'training' mode where the user can select or deselect which types of segments will appear. (If there is a particular set of obstacles like the rotating triangles that keep killing you, then isolate them and practice running their gauntlet until mastery has occurred.)2. Add variable speed scaler in either the (+) or (-) direction3. Add color option to modify the luminosity/hue of Unpossible's color theme.4. For PC add controller support for gamepads, analog sticks, etc....5. Increase Max sensitivity range for controls.6. For those who might be having difficulty add a ""ghost' mode that allows the player to follow a translucent line through the obstacles. Users can follow the path and become familiar with certain 'difficult' areas of the game.7. Simultaneous multiplayer mode (VS.)Personal improvement area (at least it helped me)8. When playing, stare downrange as far as possible to see what is coming and use your peripheral vision to navigate.9. Practice when you first wake up after you've had a good rest and some healthy food.10. Try to position yourself on the upslope of the curve to see what is coming next.Finally, in update 3 you asked what the super hard mode past 'ultra' should be. I would vote the simple route. Call it 'Unpossible.'			"

												Upossible is a First-Person, racing, fast paced indie game that is about as good as it is difficult. So very fun! But, also, very difficult!In Unpossible, you bassically try to get at least a score of 60 seconds, to go on to the other levels. The levels get more difficult as you progress. There isn't a story in the game, since it's just a game where you beat your high score on each level. For example, the easiest level, (Daily Simplicity), is easy to get a high score. But, in higher and more advanced levels, such as Futile, its's more challenging, and requires you to think fast and on the spot about where you need to go, making getting a high score moe difficult as you progress. The only controls are A and D, so there isn't much complexity there, either.Overall, this game is really fun. I recommend it to everyone. Plus, it is a very cheap game, so, it's not hard to aquire a copy.			"

												probably one of the trippiest and best arcade racing games I've ever played. Great for the price too. Only thing I want are more themes, as the blue night gets boring after a bit. A reskin with a sunset skybox and orange neons would be pretty neat to have in an update. Also, the game doesn't have workshop support. That takes away from it a bit, but overall very good.			"

												As a short review it's a great game that introduces a very well designed 3D feel to the reaction game genre. For a pretty low price of $3 (as of 16/12/2015) it definitely should provide a few hours of gameplay. As a more critical review here are some points to consider:1. Sensitivity is really hard to get right. Depending on what obstacles you face it's either too sensitive for small precise gaps or too slow for long winding turns. For a reaction based game it's somewhat annoying to not have a perfect sensitivity that matches the games design of obstacles. 2. Other than the few hours of gameplay I mentioned at the start I don't see this game being playable after that. Yes there are achievements but they are somewhat boring (for instance achieving 60 seconds on a certain level on 30 DIFFERENT DAYS? I get they're trying to make you play for longer but it's just boring and meaningless and there's no real sense of achievement). 3. Music is questionable at times. For a cheap game it's not awful but it could definitely have been designed to be more dramatic rather than just mere electronic background noise. 4. Visuals could have been so much better. I'm probably just being cynical at this point but considering this game was available previously for IOS and android and was originally released as $10 on steam the developers surely had some budget to ramp up the lighting in the game and sharpen the visuals (the black with blue neons had so much potential to reminiscence TRON). Other than that I adore the sensation of being inside the game this gives you compared to my typical reaction games like the impossible game or super hexagon.			"

												A nice little gae you can play in between without having to invest too much time, attention or patience.The looks are quite fine, and so is the music.Not sure whether I would have paid the - kinda high - full price for it though.			"

												I really loved this game on mobile (android) so much that I was waiting for the game to be greenlit and added on steam. At last, it finally went on steam!As for the review go, it may be biased, but who cares.The optimization is pretty neat, however, since I have a pretty beefy computer and it's still not at 60 fps but I can play games like crysis on highest settings and get 60+ fpsBut putting fps aside, I just enjoy this game because the music + reflex interactionsAlso, if you alt-tab out of the game and go back, the controller settings will get messed up / wont be able to see mouse. Have to close the game and relaunch to fix this problemI wish the game wouldnt pause every time i tab out, and wish there was an ""continue audio in background"" option because I like the music			"

												A short review on this game;In the begining very funny game with a nice different challange i haven't meet in games before (this is the only possetive side) ,but not so funny after muting the game.After putting totaly mute on the game ,it started to crasch and i was thinking - ""hey its just one time . it probably happens now and then..."". But then a secound time and a third time and so on..i started to belive i had a virus so i run a check just to make sure it wasnt bad stuff on my computor ,then restarting the computor and trying again...Now it have crashed more then 20 times.And its not that i run on a bad computor ,here are the specs;i7 4770 (3,5gh)12 gig ram.960gtx 2gb.So from my point of the view is that ,its probably more funny when it works ,right now its just a piece of crap i payed for.As it looks right now i would not recommend to buy it ,even if its cheap. - Then i would rather recommend to buy it on the cellhpones instead.And yes i will probably get my money back for this game.

												I absolutely love the layout of this game! The futuristic feel is amazing! It really keeps you occupied for minutes on end and makes you come back for more! The simplicity of it very impressive! 10/10!!			"
