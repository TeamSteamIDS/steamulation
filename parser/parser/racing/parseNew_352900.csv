												This game is a better looking, but much worse playing version of SpeedRunners. The controls are sloppy (especially when trying to quickly switch directions), the boost has less effect than simply dashing, the power-ups don't really seem to do anything and are easily avoided, and there is effectively no reason to spend your money on this game. I highly recommend playing SpeedRunners instead as it at least has an online community of players, let alone precise controls. I don't expect to get a refund, but I would certainly like one.			"

												A decent game that is way better the more people you play it with. I tried to do some ranked matches but does not seem that many people play the game. Takes a while to get fully used to the controllers and start beating the easy bots (and my girlfriend in this case). The medium and hard bots are insanely overpowered. Maybe if you are a Jedi master with some Sith blood in the mix you can defeat them.My review is a bit mixed. I probably won't play it that much but if you like these types of games and enjoyed Giana Sisters: Twisted Dream then go for it. The issue with these games is they rely heavily having people to play with and nowadays that seems to become more and more rare.We had fun at least playing it.

												A while ago I played Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams as well as Twisted Dreams Rise of the Owlverlord and enjoyed both games quite a bit. Giana Sisters: Dream Runners shares a lot in common with those two games but is also quite a bit different. Dream Runners takes the previous Giana Sisters games and turns them into a speed running game. I found Dream Runners to be a fun multiplayer game. The game does a good job keeping all of the races close with many races ending with players almost right on top of one another.At times the game is a little too quick which makes it hard to see what is going on. This is especially true for the player in first place. I also encountered a couple issues with the game making some mistakes picking the winner for some of the rounds when two players were within steps of one another.If you like speedrunners, like the Giana Sisters franchise, or like multiplayer platformers I think you will enjoy Giana Sisters: Dream Runners.Note: I received a free review copy of the game. Other than receiving the free review copy I received no other compensation for this review. Read My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com] "

												Well, I guess i am late to write this review. Whatever, I've bought this game about 6 months ago. It was on the sale which is %50 off. I thought the game is pretty. A platforming plus racing game and includes Giana Sisters. All the dynamics that I love in Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams. Now, I see this is an awful game for sure.   They tried to combine Giana Sister's mechanics with racing game. In fact it could be quite interesting (actually it is). I don't want to compare this game with Speedrunners that much I definetely can Speedrunners is better. It's fun and friendly. Community is huge also has steam workshop support. Dream Runners has few maps which is like 9. The game doesn't run very well. Items are not that much usable, You can host a custom game with 3 bots (and their level can be easy-medium-hard) and play all the maps but probably within 3 hours you will get bored. Since there is no players (probably sales are not good and reviews are really less) there is no multiplayer at all. The game is completely dead and the fact is, it haven't been 1 year yet. There is a lot of con. The only pro's are musics/ost and level design as usually, no doubt. Buy this game only if you want to play with a friend of yours. However I still do not recommend. I feel sorry for this game.			"

												A hesitant thumbs up. Its a great game which borrows a lot from the platformers in the series, but missed some of the polish. There are a lot of frustrating bugs in this game. The biggest issue is frequent confusion about which direction to run in. Often you are faced with a situation where there are no signsand the players are face in the wrong direction which is unforgivable an bug for this type of game. Sometimes the robots make noises like the sisters do which just seems wrong. The powerups are meh, and noone ever seems to be online, but overall the game is pretty good fun.			"

												Just go play Speedrunners. It plays better, it runs smoother, the controls are easier, and the online community is quite active, the items are actually useful. This one, compared to Speedrunners? 3 bucks cheaper, better graphics. That's it.I only reccomend this game to fans of the Giana Sisters, other than that, just go try  Speedrunners for a much better experience.			"
