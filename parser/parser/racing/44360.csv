												I got this to run once just after I bought it. Now Games for Windows Live error stops it launching. I doubt there will ever be a fix, I've tried all the hacks suggested in forums. Shouldn't be on saleUpdate: thanks for the tips, when I say I've tried all the hacks I mean all of them, every order of installing, every compatability mode, every administrative level. Not going to waste any more time on it. If it's on sale on Steam none of that should be needed, should be patched to work, thus the negative review. If you must buy it make very sure it does work for you in the refund time window and be prepared for it to stop working for no apparent reason. Should really be sold as some kind of puzzle game, I've had about 20 hours gameplay as that, beat me though, first one in a long while.			"

												The main intrigue of F1 2011 was clear in advance — what of numerous shortcomings of the crude predecessor will manage to correct this time? On a choice were offered graphics (too gloomy for such glamourous sport), physics (tram), artificial intelligence of rivals (together with a cursor it was copied from DiRT and GRID not familiar with the world of ""Formula One""), repetitions of races (even it is close not similar to the telepicture) and all intra game menus (annoyingly slow). Effect of freshness which last year's game (F1 2010 knocked down I was the official simulator of ""Formula One"" first for much years) this time any more won't work therefore as some are expressed not nice Russian партократы, ""the turn of policy of real affairs"" came. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

F1 2011 works on Windows 8 and 10. Stop complaining about it.F1 2011 is my favorite game of Codemasters' F1 games and that's maybe because it was the first one I played.I bought F1 2011 this year for computer and it's even more fun than I had on console. The cars have so much grip, but they like to understeer in low-speed corners. I just like the handling except when it rains. The game has all the teams from the F1 2011 season, but some drivers are missing due to them getting switched to reserve or something like that. The damage model is okay, but you hardly get any damage if you don't crash into a wall 200kph. That's why I fixed it by editing loose parts settings. The game has also interviews which are usually optional except when you choose your rival or at the start choose your name and stuff. F1 2011 has great Career mode due to the interviews, motorhome and other features.Overall F1 2011 is a good game, but has quite bad AI sadly.4/5 - Good or whatever...			"

												Simulation racers have always been a double edged sword for me, some are good, some are bad but most I have come to hate. Every once in a while though a game comes along that changes your entire preconceived notion of the genre; F1 2011 is one of those games. F1 2011 is the sequel to the hit F1 2010, and while this game was a hit it suffered from a shoddy console port and early release to meet console schedules which resulted in game breaking bugs. The biggest question a person could ask is does 2011 suffer from any of the same problems that 2010 did or have they been remedied? The easiest way to put it, yes the bugs have been worked out.Breaking into F1 2011 is quite a simple and enjoyable experience; with everything from an intuitive menu system to detailed stats located throughout. It's one of those games that is focused on the theatrics and immersion to keep you engaged all the way from menu to race and works quite well. There are several modes to choose from ranging from Career, Grand Prix, Multiplayer and Proving Grounds. The Career takes you across the entire 2011 Formula One race circuit with the choice of picking from one of twelve teams and twenty four drivers. This is by far one of the most well setup careers for a racing game I have seen in a long time and as you progress you actually feel as if you are moving up in the ranks. With leveling, challenges, practice, long qualifying and races you can make anywhere from 3 to nearly 75 laps; you will never find yourself looking for something to do.Grand Prix is very similar to the career but more of an arcade mode. You can just jump in, pick a car and select a line-up of tracks that you want to do rather than the linear career which is locked down to the real 2011 race season. This is a good way to get a feel for all the tracks and cars prior to actually dedicating yourself to the career. Multiplayer is fully customizable with so many options and things to do it's impossible to list without droning on. They really went all out on this with three modes to partake in multiplayer, Online, Splitscreen and LAN. The final mode is Proving Grounds which has two individual modes within it, Time Trials and Time Attack. Time Trials is a basic trial mode where you pick a track and try to get the best lap times you possibly can while facing off against a ghost car of your previous best times. Time Attack works similar to this but pits you against set times to beat and attain gold, silver or bronze metals as a reward for refining your driving abilities and beating times.This is the product of a console port that did everything correctly. No bugs that I could find, fluid motion, fairly high detailed environments and a driving experience that will leave you wanting more and more. Making your way through the career will leave you with a sense accomplishment as you have to work for your position in the poles. Dynamic difficulty is very apparent as you complete races; it seems as if with every win the competition gets harder and harder to keep you on your toes. If you are looking to create a car suited to your specific wants and needs there is no shortage of customization for this. You can choose specific tires for the event, a variable scale from wet to dry for your top speed and down-force; then tweak all aspects of the car individually so you will have the perfect race winning machine.All of the menus in the game and ways you select things heighten the overall immersion into it. Things flow with a natural pace and easy to understand parameters for selections which never confuse you into doing something you don't want to do. Before, during and after races you are granted a true Formula One experience which includes interviews, reading mail you have received, or hanging out in your trailer watching the world of activity taking place outside. For the most part the environments are stunning, there will be moments of photo realism which cannot even be put into words but this is a contrast to the things which are also not very convincing like low texture quality on certain things. With 19 locations spanning all across the globe the amount of sights to take in is massive. Tracks are designed to exact specifications just as if they are real and the weather effects are something out of this world.Taking part in a race in the rain versus a clear and dry day is a night and day difference. Not only will the world around you look more real and convincing but so will the race. The amount of tension you get from taking corners in the rain is breath taking. Watching the spray from it as it flies off of the car’s tires is something else and the visual effects accomplished through the use of DirectX 11 technology is out of this world. To put it mildly the game is beautiful but just as expected from a console port it does exhibit some drawbacks to overall visual quality due to limitations of 6 year old consoles.Multiplayer is a testament to how much love and care was devoted to this game, it works great for international play, has a nice learning curve for playing with actual humans and some fantastic modes. You can go head to head with friends, play actual races with a full roster, do co-op or even split screen for those limited to playing at home. They really pulled out all the stops for this and give you multiplayer gaming just as you would want and need, nothing was spared here.If you are looking for a realistic Formula One experience this is as close as you will get to taking a trip to Monaco and watching a race first hand. The sound of the engines, tires screeching, crowds cheering and cars that handle like they are on rails. This game is a true testament to those who have a huge passion for racing and for games. I don't know how I can put it plainly enough but everything just works! This is without a doubt the most well rounded racing title I can think of, you would be absolutely out of your mind to not check this out and for those missing out on it; what a shame.			"

F1 2011Review Edit, (first review done in 2011)F1 2011 is a big step up from 2010. New features include DRS and Kers an improved handling model and improved AI. The AI has been upped for 2011 and you now start seeing AI make mistakes which is nice. Again a great progressive career mode. Tyre wear and managment has been improved and moved over to Pirelli from Bridgestone, and thr Kers and DRS give you a boost in overtaking situationsFreerider-Dave "

												The Beauty and the Beast!.When it works, it's the closer emulation of F1 you will find and, gives a LOT OF FUN to F1 fans.The hell is that, from time to time, the game doesn't starts or, you loose the configuration of your wheel, EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A RACE!!!!.The worst thing is that Codemaster's people doesn't seem very entusiastics on releasing fixes for the serious bugs that this game has from time to time.So, when it works, 100% recommendable.When it doesn't works... can I burn Codemaster's headquarter?The part of this game I really hate is competition in pro or legend mode. THAT'S PURE CHEAT!!!.It doesn't matter what I do, I always classify the 18th and, my team mate the 17th.I can win lot of positions during the few first curves but then, cars start to push me out of the track or, the car oversteers or understeer, until I go back to postion 18th or just a position before my team mate.CHEAT CHEAT CHEATI hope future versions are fair on this, because it's really annoying.

												Out of all the F1 games I own, I like this one the best and have played it the most. As for Games for Windows live, it's fine IF you have an xbox account or even a microsoft account and honestly it's a great idea but I guess there are problems. Also 2011's price is worth it for the experience of having a more involved but not too hard to start carrer mode, so if you are too poor for f1 2016 get either 2011 or 2013 on sale.			"

Con: Windows live takes away some CPU cycles which could otherwise be used to get higher frame rate.Stating the obvious; it's very low price now and even lower when on sale. I was initially wary of F1 titles because the demo keeps crashing on launch. My first purchase was F1 2014; it worked! and well optimized for my potato chips. Later on i bought Codemasters earlier titles because of their lower system requirements should work better on my system. Well i'm not sure; they all work well, not sure if the older titles are quicker since there is that live thingie baggage tagging along for the ride.I think it needs to be reiterated that it's hard on keyboard but not impossible "

												This game was ruined by Microsoft. I bought it bc I was thinking my computer would be more likely to run this version than one of the newer ones. They made me sign up for a Microsoft account as well as an xbox account before telling me to go screw myself. Will not let me sign in and the greedy ducks who made this game will not let you save unless you sign in. Luckily I bought it on sale but I still feel cheated for paying any amount of money for this garbage.			"

Definitely the best F1 game up to date, although I miss podium celebrations and a parade lap. New feature in this game is the co op championship online with a friend. This is so much fun with a good friend!			"

												Hi there,Keyboard user review,as far as F1 games go I still can't go past the old Micro Prose GP3 , I still think the 2011 here is a good game overall and play/run well , only one crash to date , simple set-up for using your keyboard and can say this is far more fun than the 2014 version if looking for a cheaper one to play as new releases are costly I rate this game 8/10 "

												A good F1 driving game.  Accessible and easy to get into with an Xbox controller but only on the easier settings.  I think it would need a steering wheel to get the most from.  The tracks feel very realistic and adds to my enjoyment of watching F1.  7/10			"

												F1 2011 is an excellent combination of challenging gameplay and that real race feeling that faithfully represents the thrill and difficulty of driving the world's best racing cars. A must buy for all racing simulator fans. Yeah, baby! Push, push!			"

												Great racing game, best racing AI so far, also 2 player coop championship vs 22 ai and online multiplayer with 16 players and 8 AI for a full 24 car grid. Also has proving grounds where you have to set a time at certain challenges with global / friends leaderboards.			"

												Solid F1 racing simulator, for experienced and beginning racers. It gives you a challenge but it also rewards you with an awesome feeling when you're driving as first over that finishing line.			"

												It's not really a full-blown simulation, but it's fun to play. Car physics are not too bad and the career part of the game is really motivating.			"
