												This game is not without its flaws, but it is still massively fun to play.  It comes with a Glide wrapper, but DOSBOX needs to have the config files edited to enable it.  Once you do so, you'll be able to get the game in much higher resoutions than were available before by using the 3DFX version.  The ranking system in game is based entirely on how many points you earn in a match, so find a good map that you can get a lot of points on and grind it as much as possible.  You can unlock some cars through play, but when you finish all the maps in the game and 'beat' it you unlock everything, even cars that don't unlock normally.  The levels do not confine you to one track, you can explore to your heart's content - assuming you don't run out of time.  Even the semi-Stand Alone expansion, the Splat Pack, is included.  Just remember, this is an old game with some early design ideas that didn't always work well, but the game IS very fun to play and enjoy!			"

												This is the classic that paved the way for many racing games to come. This is a game that in 1997 created the racing game sandbox experience that would become a staple for the genre only many years after. The way cities are sectioned into multiple tracks, and the way it doesn't impose a single objective, the way you can change focus between doing checkpoints, running over pedestrians, wrecking your opponents or just exploring the sandboxes is so ahead of it's time that even now, almost 20 years after it's release and after the mist of controversy has dissipated, it still feels fresh and an achievement in videogame design.That it's gameplay and it's itch can still be scratched only by itself even now, so many years after it's release and so many clones in between says much more than anything that has probably been written.

												Ah, Carmageddon, a game where you don't just race other opponents, but also try to destroy them, and run over hundreds of innocent pedestrians in the process. Wicked fun. And you are rewarded for all of this, which makes it even more fun. The game even lets you know how many pedestrians there are on each level, so you can make sure every single one is mangled.There are some old games that I think have really good looking graphics, even though they aren't very realistic like modern games. Carmageddon is one of them. There's a grittiness and personallity to the graphics that new games don't have. The lower detail of the graphics also gives the game a little more challenge, as it can be hard to see things coming up at times (at least before you get used to the graphics}.The game can be annoying at times though. I found the vehicle handling/controls hard to get used to as first. At least with one car, you can easily get stuck to walls, and have to steer into the wall to get free. That doesn't really stop being annoying. Also if you go too fast up a steep hill, you can end up launching off and flying way too far, and will end up needing to be recovered. These minor things don't detract from the fun though.The game has some good music that goes good with the game. There some rock songs and some electronic songs. But if you don't like them or get tired of them, you can always turn on some Metal. Metal goes great with this game.Carmageddon is a lot of fun. If you like games like Postal or GTA. If you like running over people, wrecking cars, and causing chaos, then you will like this game. If you haven't already played it and don't own it, then you should get it now. Or when it's on sale.9.5/10			"

												You know when you see a game you played as a younger you and you remember it sugar coated... ?Well Carmageddon is not one of those games.Infact it's even better then i remember, this is why...1, It's a Total open world game. The levels are quite massive, and VERY well made, you can even race on rooftops.2, The graphics are pretty good even today, (with shaders on and wotnot)3, The Music is awsome and fits the game very well.4, The A.I is actually pretty good, If you kill a driver, they will remember you and next time you race them they will do there best to mess you up.5, There are a LOT of different weapons to help you kill and some that mess you up too.6, The game knows how you kill Peds and rewards you for artistic impression, so thats pretty sweet.7, it's VERY fast, when you get level 5 upgrades and some power ups the speed is mad, even faster then Wipeout2097.8, ... well i could go on but i am bored now and i want to get back playing it...Just for informationIt uses DosBox, i run Windows8.1 x64 and it works with no problems, it's only crashed 1 in 17 hours so far.The XboX Joypad will work fine with it after you set it up and the steering is analogue however it is VERY sensitive.So if you played this game when it came out like i did, you should just buy it, well actually buy Carmageddon Reincarnation and get this for free. You won't regret it.			"

												Carmageddon is an absolute classic and one of the best driving games you will ever play.The Story and goal of each level is basically: Run over pedestrians, destroy your opponents, win races :POne of the main features that set Carmageddon apart from other racing games is the variety of ways you can win each race as well as the wide open maps.The easiest way to win each race is to just destroy your opponents and while your opponents get stronger the further you progress, the Power. Armour and Speed upgrades you can put on to your car will help immensely.The other 2 ways are the bog standard checkpoint route and running over every single pedestrian which will take a LOT of time as there are hundreds of them every race and hidden all over the track.There are also plenty of powerups strewn throughout the races both fun and useful such as an electro ray and frozen opponents, or disadvantageous to you such as jelly suspension and turbo cops.Speaking of cops, you will occasionaly encounter them as you first play but towards the end there will be cops around almost every corner and are very hard to destroy making the later courses fairly difficult.The graphics are still very playable to this day with nice car and damage modelling, funny pedestrian sprites and a decent variety of track layouts to explore. The audio is equally decent with a kickass soundtrack from Fear Factory and the crashes and clangs of each car not to mention the funny quips from your pratcam driver.With over 30 cars to drive when completed and over 30 tracks to complete there is plenty of value to be had, not to mention the splat pack expansion which adds an additional 20 tracks and cars each.Overall Carmageddon is a timeless classic that all oldskool pc gamers and racing fans will enjoy, "

												This game I got as a gift from a friend and holy...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it takes me back some 15+ years back into my mid-teens....I missed this game so much!!For the ones that dont know, this game was based on the 1970's film Death Race 2000. This game become an instant cult hit back then when games were going through the hard time of being too violent ect.  It stood out because, yes it was graphic and violent, but also it was a different sort of racing game.  In such you can win a race by doing all the checkpoints in order and doing laps like a regular race, wrecking your opponents cars ( my tactic of choice ) or killing every single pedestrian on the map.Along with these unique races come proper zany as hell power ups.  Like my faves Solid Granite Car and Pedestrian Electro-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ray...yes thats a thing...and many more, even combining into some outstanding effects.The AI racers also have some good AI as well.  They are set in their ways and go about racing their own way.  Some wanna race, some wanna run over peds and some just wanna turn around and ram you all shapes to Sunday.Yes the game looks dated, so what!?  its a great game to begin with and has a sweet soundtrack, with 3 tracks supplied by Fear Factory from their album Demanufacture.Nice and simple upgrade system, no fussing around or logic needed, just choose either upping your Offense, Armour or Speed.   All in all I am personally pleased this game has made it to Steam and give a new generation a chance at what was once one of the worlds more controversial games.			"

Here are the reasons: No rules! three different ways to win the race, everyone knows. Humor, original cars, blood, big tracks, multiplayer, cockpit view, etc - All this is here! Strongly recommended for nostalgic gamers and for those who want a good and fun racing game. 10/10			"

												*Includes Impressions Video*Where to begin with this classic entry of car carnage? It's race how you want at its finest. You can either wreck your opponents or drive over all its spectators (read: everyday bystanders and pedestrians), or merely hit all the checkpoints (still driving way off-track to get there quicker). Hitting opponents and peds award time and credits, the latter used to upgrade your vehicle's armor, engine, and offensive strength. Your race profits determine how many rankings you rise, which unlock new routes and environments to crash through. Once you dip into sub-80s, you unlock additional vehicles through random chance after wrecking certain opponents.There are dozens of crazy car designs that all handle differently, included with driver info for the completion of crazy. Your standard Eagle (or Die Anna's Hawk) has very good starting stats and will carry the player through most of the game even so though. Once you beat the game, you may want to drive the inaccessible ones even...There is no race happening, no concern about position, no pit-stops, and no rules. For the player, there is no option but first place. You may get bonuses by knocking objects and lampposts into the peds, driving backwards or sliding into them, or sandwiching them on a wall. Power-ups (although temporary) add to this chaos. They can modify your abilities, increase your engine power, respawn all peds, freeze opponents, turbo the opponents, allow you to drive unhindered underwater, increase your damage strength and so on. This game has introduced some of the wackiest additions to races, including but limited to, Pinball Mode, Jelly Suspension, Gravity From Jupiter, and Wall Climber.The damage modeling is dynamic and even today we are only just starting to refine how this is done, such as with BeamNG and Next Car Game. Burnout may be considered one of the first, but Carmageddon really is the first to feature real-time 60 fps 3D racing as well as dynamic damage modeling based on how you have collided your car. No two impacts are the same (and your opponents will never be left the same!). Internal damage is incurred through these high-speed impacts and usually matches the severity of the cosmetic damage. Each component is given a damage indicator which moves from Unmarked, Green, and Red/Orange, to flashing Red, finally Black - Damaged wheels are not straight on the axle and bounce your car around, while a broken transmission will constantly stall your car back into the first gear. A damaged steeling column will hinder your turning ability, randomly making it turn the opposite way, with blackened disabling steering altogether.The Max Pack includes both the original Carma and its Splat Pack expansion, launching through the DOSBox emulator. You are given the option of launching with original software graphics, or emulating it in 3DFX Glide, which beautifully renders the models and environment on modern graphics cards. Most of the textures handle modern resolutions well, and using Nvidia's Anti-Alias override (on the DOSBOX exe) smoothes out any minor jaggies remaining. It uses the original CD images of the games, then mounts them virtually. This is not a port, but rather a very good package that lets these classics run out of the box.Online play appears to be a possibility in this version, with selectable ""Launch Carmageddon Multiplayer Host"" and ""Client"" launch options. In practice, it actually does work without any third-party tools, with the host only needing to forward Port 213 in their router. However it has severe desync issues, especially randomly freezing the other car (for one player though) if they separate into another area of the map - which instantly means a desync. This package is provided as-is, so we will have to see if this area is ever improved. It is likely to be a dosbox issue more than Carmageddon itself though.On the whole, side, front, half, this game is really recommended. Fans of the game should like what they get; it is as close to the original as can be played on modern systems. It is as fun as you remember it. The damage systems and gameplay style have aged fairly well. The physics are arcadey and floaty (in a good way), as you find yourself flying through the air when you ramp off a sign, then somehow land on your wheels. Despite that, you can still keep your wheels straight without randomly losing traction, even at decent speed. For newcomers, I would say the learning curve is not much (stress-relief ya know) and they will enjoy its charm and freedom even with newer car games now available.

												Ah, Carmageddon, a hideously beautiful relic of my misanthropic adolescence, back from the grave. This is a DOSBox-emulation-and-all resurrection, so while I'm happy to say it's still damned entertaining to play, most of the old issues remain, or have worsened with time. The cartoon physics are as spotty as ever, and the rock-stupid A.I.  goes from quaint to frustrating in five minutes flat. As is the sad fate of nearly every early use of 3-D graphics, the game's visuals have aged horribly: The low maximum draw distance is the most harmful to gameplay, but the game's entire appearance is so primitive that it can take a minute before your eyes can even decode the blobby, jagged blur of early polygon magic whizzing by you. All of that said, none of that completely negates that one most important thing: FUN. Nasty, sneering, blood-drenched fun. Making cars go smash, plowing through churchgoers, and, for the more advanced student, crushing and electrocuting two entire football teams, all remain as satisfactory as ever.Bottom line, it's a bit of cult gaming history, perfect for fans of racing and comedic ultra-violence alike. Buy it for the snotty, sneering little twerp inside of us all.			"

												A good way to remember old times.A game way ahead for its time. Blood, metal and Gazoline, all you need to let the day go by.I remember playing this back when I was in secondary school on a friend's pc.. amazing memories.Bad news is that the game has quite a few problems. Crashes, FPS drops, sound muting bugs, bad save game handling and so on. Things that ofc didn't really exist that time since most of the bugs appear due to the modern OS conflicts.I'm not sure if you should pay to get this game now unless you are an insane fan of the franchise or unless you grab it on a special offer on on the franchise pack that is available with the new 3rd franchise addition that seems to be very promising and worthy.Cheers.

And its literally the same game back then. Already modded to work fully in latest hardware, and it workes better than the emulated version i was using.Its got a massive selection of race areas, and eventually you will have hte massive selection of cars to race with too. I cant wait for the new one to be finished, but this will surly pass the time till then.Dont forget to splat the flag berarer, $1000 right there!			"

												To anybody who hasn't heard of Carmageddon series before, one sentence can describe it perfectly: players are rewarded for killing everything, enemies and pedestrians alike. It's a racing game at heart, but you can finish the race either by actually racing, killing every one of your opponents, or running over every pedestrian in the track. The latter is the most difficult, as there are typically about 400-500 peds per map.While the game has certainly aged and carries  with it the stigma of its 1990s-era graphics, there is little in the way of alternatives that offer a better experience at this time. Suffice it to say, if this game is up your alley, you can deal with the graphics. And you will, because the game is that worth playing.Don't go into this expecting a story. Go into it for completion, for upgrading your car and becoming more proficient in killing everything in sight, and you'll love this game beginning to end.			"

Finally I get to play it :DFor anyone having doubts that this won't run on newer systems, my system is pretty ""beefy"" and it runs fine through DOS-box, the controls are a bit iffy with the numpad and the steering seems to have a mind of its own when you suddenly end up swirving all over the place uncontrollably. Other than that, this game is bloody amazing :D Probably one of the few racing games I actually enjoy and is actually unique!			"

												A legend. The game, which in nice, immaculate world wouldn´t have a chance to success. Luckily, we live in this world.Works like a charm on a strong machine, 3DFX version runs great here too. Really not dissapointed for buying  Carmageddon Reincarnation early access and got first three carmas for free.			"

												Game itself is good, great car designs, nice variety of driver personalities, fun gameplay but unfortunately..playing this on Dosbox means low framerates pretty much even if I had a GTX 1080 and game graphics settings at lowest..I hope a port of this would be made.			"

												To think this game came out in 1997 yet is still so playable and satisfying today with its solid gameplay.CARMAGEDDON is a pure visceral thrill ride of stress venting that leaves me totally relaxed afterwards with its amazing though exaggerated physics system as one crashes into oppenant's racing cars seeing them take physical dents along with falling parts damage from the high speed impact. Its great to see touches of realism like ones engine smoking after taking a headon collision. This same smoke will obscure your vision just enough to make hitting oppenants and pedestrians a bit more difficult but in a fun non frustrating way.Enemy ai is very well done with them giving the illusion of having their own purposes. Sometimes they'll ignore you while going against other racers and other times they'll hunt you down for many a street city block especially if you just bumped into them ""accidently"" :D Pedestrians will scream in terror at your approach and will start running for their stinking lives when they see you racing like a bat out of hell down the street.Graphics are sweet in their brutality. It is quite a joy mowing down an old granny in a walker who reminds you of a certain passive aggressive senior citizen we have all had to deal with. CARMAGEDDON takes the wait out of waiting for the nursing home staff to show up to take them away as they scream in terror before you pile drive them with your race car against a building wall sending guts eyeballs and entrails flying everywhere. Ooo and what a squishy sound they make as i run over their dead bodies afterward. Then theres the sexy boys... ooo i hate sexy boys!Sound effects are top notch from the screeching grind of cars rubbing up against a building to the POW! of crashing into public telephones and street lights. Its a real riot hearing pedestrians death screams when scoring points for killing them along with time bonuses. If one does a fancy move or stunt while killing them one is awarded even more points and or cash. Hearing your character cracking jokes or cursing really adds to the sense of immersion.A timeless classic full of black humor and relaxing venting still absolutely playable and still gives any ""modern"" racing game a run for its money.Thanks Interplay and SCi for the endless fun :D			"

												Ever since the 1990's, when 3D gaming was still an infant, they constantly pushed the boundries of what was possible. Whether it would be a 3D shooter game, racing game, RPG game, or a strategy game, they all played well and looked good.Carmageddon is no exception. Ever since this game came out during teh 1990's, it's been the hottest racing game ever. Not just because it's a racing game, but it's a racing with a challenge as well as having mini goals. You're not just racing to survive, but you're also racing to smack the hell out of as many pedestrians as possible. With the many kinds of odd racing out there, this one is still king (IMHO) as well as started it all.Course, you don't have to just go through all the check points to win the race, just bash the hell out of some other racers and take them out of the race to win. The only challenge is that you don't get much time to do this, as the timer ticks down the longer you are racing.For those who are not familiar with the game, some of the many features include...1.) Gain time by running over people, performing cool stunts, or smacking racers just right2.) Power ups lay all over the race which give you either land mines, extra time, or a spiked tail (Don't ask)3.) Ability to buy vehicles and upgrades as you progress through the game4.) Gain money by winning the race, killing all other racers, smacking peds, or performing stunts5.) Many race tracks and 40+ (Main game + Splat pack) vehicles to choose from6.) Complete open worlds, explore to your hearts content on each race track7.) Peds count ranges from 200+ to 500+ per race track8.) Race hard enough, and earn the super armoured police vehicleAnd so much more. Keep in mind of course that the graphics are not up to par with todays 3D gaming, but then the game is over 20 years old.Overall, a fun killing spree with a feel of a racing game, and with so many cars to choose from, you will want to race even harder to get those vehicles in your list. Race against other racers, slam some peds, and bash other racers out of the way. What more could you want in a racing game?			"

												This is the one that started it all off!  Accept no imitations!  Even though there is a new version of this that is released on Steam, playing the old version of Carmageddon 1 is still fun even after all these years.  You can either race the track, or smash the opponents cars in, or run over people sheep and old ladies, the choice is up to you.  For originality this has to get 110%.  If you have never played this before then I would strongly recommend getting it.  It is much much much more than a bog standard racing game.  Admittedly the gfx look a bit dated but the gameplay is great.			"

												Carmageddon isn't just an awesome game because it's essentially the playable version of the movie Death Race 2000 (which is available in the public domain on Youtube), it's a great game because the hard difficulty turns the game from a bloody yet loose open-world pedestrian masher into an actual racing game that requires quick thinking and huge balls.I personally think Carmageddon plays it too loose with its formula. You get huge, huge amounts of time to actually complete the race, and every car you destroy or every civilian you run down adds a not insignificant amount to it. I wanted it to be more like an actual race, one where you have to quickly explore and find the secrets in order to get enough time to either finish or kill your opponents. Something quicker and snappier. I found out that Hard mode solves all of my complaints - you start out with 30 seconds, which means you need to start driving on the sidewalk immediately to turn wholesome North American guts into fuel for your hell vehicle. It encourages breaking off from the ""track"" to see the city and find new exciting pedestrians to murder. It is tough as♥♥♥♥♥♥but it is well worth it to see all the cool hidden areas the developers thoughtfully put in. It's that or wander around the track until you decide that killing every pedestrian is a ♥♥♥♥ing tedious exercise and end up destroying the other combatants. Or finishing the race, because you are 50 years old and you need to get back to filling out your Old People Forms.Anyway, Carmageddon is one of the greats and despite my moaning about it it's still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun to play after all these years.

												The noblest pursuit of all gamers and petrol heads is encompassed by this masterpiece of digital entertainment.A timeless classic has been brought back from near extinction. The cumbersome obstacles such mastering the reverse-engineered DOSbox and the long outdated supported Operating Systems and 3DFX cards of yester year are no longer the illuminating beacons holding the guiding light toward vast citiscapes of twisted metal and burning rubber.Here, today, on this mighty platform we can share the elation of blazing through crowds of gormless pedestrians and wildstock, the exhilaration of t-boning your adversaries with an oversized dump truck and the exhaustion of being rammed all night long, unrestricted, uncensored and untainted by the passage of time. Do I recommend this game? Yes.Was my childhood a bright one? Yes.Will you be forever ruined as an upstanding citizen of your country? It goes without saying, but... YES.			"

PROS:+ really fun gameplay+ great soundtrack+ lots of tracks+ 90s racing game feel+ classic CarmageddonCONS:- almost no players in multiplayer- outdated graphics- sound issues when running 3dfx version- clunky controls (unable to set your own keys)Comment:Nostalgic trip to the 90s reveals an awesome game back then that currently still is pretty good. I got this in the Carmageddon: Reincarnation bundle but honestly I bought that bundle just to get this and Carmageddon 2. I used to play the two games back in the 90s on the PC of my cousin and it was a blast. Although it has aged, this is still a nice racing game. There are some issues though. The 3dfx graphics, although older, are nice but this version caused sound issues on PC when the sound would just stop. The no-3dfx version feels a tad bit too clunky visually. The key binding is fixed and even though you can pick from 4 variants it still would have been nice to be able to configure your own setting. Also maybe worth mention is that although Steam gives you options for multiplayer it does not have many players around so it is not worth bothering. Soundtrack and effects are really really great and the racing feel you get is nice (enhanced by the big amount of tracks). A cool retro game worth recommending.			"

												Carmageddon is a vehicular combat 'racing' game by UK developer Stainless Software released in 1997 to much acclaim for its advanced car damage model and sandbox style freedom and plenty of controversy for its depictions of gory carnage against defenseless pedestrians. This lead to an initially censored release for the UK version with zombies that bled green, the only way it was allowed to be sold until a patch was released later on to restore the original palette. The German version didn't fare much better however and was given robots instead that bled oil. Carmageddon's main inspiration comes from the 1975 film Death Race 2000 and was originally going to be a tie-in game but licensing fell through on more than one occasion, to the point Stainless said stuff it let's just get it out.Carmageddon's a free-for-all race where you're encouraged to do whatever you want whenever you like and there is no restrictions on where you can go or what is considered fair or cheating. Your opponents will often be boring enough to race around the circuit and collect their weak paychecks from the checkpoints scattered about. Your opponents can't actually win anything however and there is no position of your standing in the race on your HUD. That's because you don't have one, and it doesn't matter anyway. What does matter is causing as much chaos as possible by either running down pedestrians, and in creative and gorier ways to net additional credits, and ramming the other cars. Wasting an opponent will give you a lot of credits, and more time than any other activity.There's a timer that counts down at the beginning of each event and all manner of shenanigans will give you extra to allow you to explore the environment at your heart's content. For all manner of juicy bonuses and hidden bonus dosh/time and various PUPs (power-ups in Carma slang) litter the circuit and the outskirts of the race. These can be pretty gosh darned handy, for example complete invulnerability, acme damage magnifier for really putting a dent in your opponents, or pedestrian electro ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ray for 30 seconds. The wacky power-downs however come in a sizable variety and are usually harmless enough, but make your vehicle harder to drive for a short period of time. Pinball mode though is a worthy mention as its especially nasty and you'll want to recover ASAP if you're flung into orbit to prevent reparing serious damage.You cannot actually be wasted yourself (at least in this first installment) but credits earned during the race are often used to repair your car, and repairing and recovering when you're on your roof or side will be happening a lot. So it's crucial to scouring and looting the race as much as possible to get more money to have enough left over at the end of a race. If you lose more than you make during a race and you didn't have much left over to begin with when you began the race your bank will go into a screaming fit and pull the plug, and this constitutes as 'game over' here. Failing a race by running out of time isn't penalizing though and you can simply jump back in and try again. You use credits earned between races to upgrade your car's abilities via APO (armor, power, offensive), which are bare-bones as upgrades come and simply make you more resistant to impacts, more horsepower, and dish out extra abuse when colliding into your opponents.All races are won in three Carma fashions: Kill all pedestrians, waste all opponents, or complete all laps. The latter is reserved for ponces however and won't really give you a whole lot of credits but it's there to sate your particular needs, you weirdo. Murdering every ped is no easy feat however, but most levels usually have a Pedestrian Respawn or two (or three) somewhere and memorizing the locations of these after you wipe out a quarter or two of the population and going back for it can give you an extra edge. Participating in races is also done by a ranking system (which was brought back in Reincarnation/Max Damage) and you start at a lowly 99 with three races to choose from and the penultimate goal is to be number one, along the way will be more challenging environments with more unhinged opponents (and cops in APCs who just refuse to get out of the way). Getting hundreds of thousands of credits an event will move the rank much more (up to 5 increases max or none whatsoever if you're absolute tripe).The player can choose between two drivers at the start and a difficulty determining starting time in a race, credits and bonus time earned from activities and how aggressive your opponents are. It's best to start on 'normal' and see how you fare, and if you're the kind of person who hides under the table during thunderstorms then easy mode should be right up your alley. Max Damage and Die Anna are the main 'heroes' of the Death Race and drive a similar model of car. Max's all-round great Eagle is better suited to rammin' and slammin' however whereas Anna's Hawk is a faster but less strong car. Nevertheless Carmageddon is an early supporter of equality, and all manner of men and women are subjected to the same treatment. Be it behind the wheel or roadkill in the street. Sometimes when you waste a specific opponent you have a chance of stealing and adding it to your collection. Some of these can be very powerful, others not so much. Beating the game will unlock every single one, including those labeled as 'cheat', your reward for being the baddest dude.Visually the game is competent, with adequate detail for the environments, early 3D models for vehicles and props that are well designed and pedestrians are rendered as 2D sprites via digitized actors. Their deaths are often extremely gruesome, easily making this the goriest entry of the series even with later installments featuring 3D peds that can lose their limbs. Sound design is loud and crunchy, and impacts with the environment and opponents feel very raw, and the peds incredibly nasty and satisfying. The soundtrack also features four tracks from Fear Factory's 1995 album Demanufacture in instrumental only form, most fitting choice given the game's militant gameplay in a pseudo-apocalyptic near future world.I have very few complaints with the way this game plays, maybe that it goes on for far too long (36 races) especially if you're trying to do the best you can on each race which can run anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour on average. Late game opponents become real damage sponges if you don't nick a better set of wheels (the Eagle/Hawk just won't cut it even at max stats) and cops are extremely difficult to waste and become very common near the end but if you manage to steal an especially hard to acquire ride in the event 'Blood on the Rooftops' you will know sweet, sweet revenge for all the trouble they were giving you early on and finish the last handful of events with pure bloody malice.Carmageddon is decidedly British in its portrayal of humor, with plenty of tongue-in-cheek jokes, British slang, and raunchiness suited for a mature audience. Which only makes sense given the dev is UK based. There's plenty of pop culture references from the era, akin to games like Duke Nukem 3D (even has a reference to OJ Simpson here too!). This should've been more than enough proof that Carmageddon's intentions were never meant to be mean-spirited or shock jockery (a suggestion to add pregnant women peds was flat out no'd), just the kind of things that make the devs♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves laughing. And you can tell they had a great time putting this game together, a real labor of love. Carmageddon also has an equally humorous and interesting development history if you look into it more. If you think most racing games are too dull and traditional and you want to insert more mayhem in to your driving experience than this game comes as highly recommended! And if you still can't get enough the Splat Pack expansion has even more content to offer. The antidote to all racers.4.0/5			"

Product received for free
What I liked about the game•	The gameplay can be very addictive and fun, especially when you're running over pedestrians and destroying other drivers. •	I liked the idea that you can see the driver in the top left-hand corner, seeing his facial expressions, when something happens during the level.  •	You have three different ways of winning each level. My favourite was destroying other drivers. •	I liked the arcade style of the game.•	The vehicles in the game are awsome, You can also unlock other driver's vehicles and use them in other levels. •	You can upgrade your car. What I disliked or was disappointed with•	Can be frustrating sometimes, police can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes you don't get credits when you should. Sometimes the last driver can prove tricky to kill. •	The vehicles in the game can be hard to control. The vehicle brakes aren't very good and sometimes turning a corner is like turning a ship.•	Out of the three different ways of beating the level, destroying each driver is probably the best way to beat the level, because killing a certain number of pedestrians takes too long and doing the laps isn't very rewarding.•	The soundtrack does get repetitive and so does the gameplay, especially towards the end. •	It's a shame you can't visually see the upgrades you made to the car. •	When playing Carmageddon on dosbox, dosbox seems to flicker a lot, especially when the game is loading the main menu. When the game is loading up, I keep seeing my internet browser and a message flicker on and off.When I double click to skip the intro sometimes I return to my internet browser and when I click back on the application to return to the game, dosbox black screens.   Conclusion A fun and addictive game, which is different compared to over racing games. It can get repetitive, but I still recommend it to any retro gaming fan. 70/100			"

The game is AWESOME!The Steam version is NOT!The game itself is a classic I think everyone knows that so it's no doubt that it's worth buying.However I recommend you to save after every level and every upgrade because the game can randomly freeze anywhere and anytime.If they fix these glitches it will be perfect!

												Considering this was originally launched in 1997, it still feels as fun to play as ever. The graphics may have aged, but the sheer excitement and satisfaction you gain when running over pedestrians while listening to awesome Fear Factory songs never does.One of the greatest PC games of all time!

												You'd think with a low-graphics game like this, it would run on just about any computer. This same game used to run just fine on my my parent's computer 10 years ago but when I try to play it now, it's jittery and the audio is very distorted. I love the game and everything but this needs to be fixed. The only way it'll run smoothly is if I turn off all the textures, which makes it so I can't see anything, which defeats the purpose of playing.			"

I think I'll have to play this game elsewhere. Also the Steam overlay seems to most of the time, hate running with this game....you can't minimize it...you have to close the game to get rid of it.

												It's  not that I don't hate the game itself, it's just that it runs on an incredibly buggy emulator that doesn't even work half the time. I shouldn't have to pay ten bucks for an emulator and a rom I could just download for free. It would make more sense if this was an updated port instead of just an emulated game.			"

												The first / true Carmageddon game released back in 1997 !Never actually played this one, started with Carmageddon 2 and played TDR2k so yea.. but i'm playing it now !Its actually very fun, u can notice that the graphics are a bit behind of the other two games but as a true carmageddon fan that i am, i easily ignore that hehe.I'm actually surprised this game has 6 more levels than the 2nd game but way less tracks, its basically diferent versions of the same, same, same tracks !But since i'm playing it for the first time, what the hell, frack it ! :DOk, now the real review...Been playing it on DosBox, its very playable, until now i haven't met any problem, besides game crashing when i messed with the files to change the draw distance, but hey, u dont need to mess with the files to begin with !I'm surprised that the cops on this game are so frickin' hard to kill and since i'm playing on Hard dificulty(commonly known as Dificulty 3) the APO, most known as Upgrades of your car, are very very expensive on this dificulty.I'm almost level 4 in all of the APO as of now, and i still find it hard to wreck a police car, dang.I love the rank system on this game, u start out at rank 99 and your goal is to hit rank 1.If i'm not mistaken i'm in between rank 59 and 55, when u get the hang of the driving in this game, its really easy to get several ranks from a single track(by ""farming"" alot of credits with combos from killing pedestrians) and thus, u can buy several APO.Also, something that every carmageddon game has(and some u buy cars dont steal) its the stealworthy feature, some cars that are stealworthy u can wreck them to add them to your garage, but its not 100% chance rate to add them to the garage when u wreck them, so beware of that.I'm trying to reach the latter levels so i can steal ""The Supressor"" the ultimate and most armored car on the game, like the normal cop cars. but this one has like 8 wheels or something.So like i said before, for an old game its been running great, without problems(on dosbox ofc!) and i've been enjoying it, so far i've played for around 20 hours and i'm still a bit far from the end of the game.I highly recommend this game !Too bad the multiplayer is basically impossible to work at this time.It would of been too fun !But for that u can play the new carmageddon game, Carmageddon : Reincarnation !Hugs and kisses for everyone !

												I recieved this in the bundle when buying Carmageddon:Reincarnation.This is a game I used to play as a kid (no I haven't run over anyone yet) and after all these years when it finally came out on steam and able to play on modern Windows PC's far easier than manually making it work, I got back into it.This game for its time had some amazing physics to go with it, each crash was different, burned areas on cars wherever they caught fire, lovely exploding peds, Annoying AI which when you finally waste their♥♥♥♥♥it's damn satisfying.If you have recently gotten into Carmageddon with the new games that have released, the original one has the smallest differences, and is definitely worth a play to see where and how this game began.

												Remember playing this game years ago, (although I recall zombies instead of civillians, as one of the cut scenes used to show Agent Orange getting mauled in his car). Great game, obviously graphics, controls and so on are out dated, but still a laugh and a good way to let off some steam. Quite unique (especially in its time) from other racing games. I may be biased in my thoughts from playing it many years ago; nostalgia.			"
