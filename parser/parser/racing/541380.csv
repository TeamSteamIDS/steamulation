												Expected more even though the price was so low. Barebones, inconsistent physics (even though the game is literally named after the word), and quite a few bugs and glitches.Graphically, it's like a track editor in games from the early 2000's. Sort of a blocky, non textured look with a basic color pallete. The car itself has no color or body. It's just a frame and tires all in grey. No options for other vehicles.Sound is generic. The music is nothing of note, and the sound effects are practically non existant. The only real sound you hear is acceleration sound and once in a while a stock crash sound that ranges from generic when crashing, to generic when getting pummeled off the track.No sense of speed either. It's go and....stop. This is made worse by the fact that there's ""cheap deaths"" . You'll need momentum for some of the jumps or fall to your doom. And in a game where the physics range wildly from tolerable to ""I live upsidedown now"" , this is just pure awful. The worst aspect of the entire game though, is the camera. If you flip or spinout, the camera mimics your car. Causing a weirdly disorienting experience. Even something as simple as keeping the camera stationary would greatly improve this ""game"".Overall, this game has potential if actual effort is put into it. As of right now it's just too similar to an asset flip with a price that will make you go ""Welp, sounds interesting and it's only a dollar!"" . Don't bother unless it's patched or updated in the future. And no, this is not early access. Yikes.			"

												Sound cut off after first respawn, every time you start the game you're in windowed mode even if you changed it, the physics seem to not be consistent here and there as it glitches out....I can see myself having a ton of fun in this after some patches, in it's current state I can't recommend it...at the same time it's priced at around the level of a handful of gravel... (but recommending something only due to price helps noone, not the developer in the future or the gamer in the present as neither wants crap...)			"

												...Where to begin on this one...Well,I've always enjoyed physics platformers and puzzle games,so when I saw a physics driving game for $1 I thought ""Hey,why not?""...Oh...Lets go over it piece by pieceTo start,the graphics are almost non-existent,just base texture,nothing special or attractive whatsoever.But there's more to a game than just graphics,so it dosen't bother me. What DOES bother me however is some textures will just dissapear at times,they'll still be there to drive on,just invisible...a um...slight problem.The sound is also mostly absent,there's no music,and the only sounds are a standard engine noise and a thump if you impact something...however,sometimes when you respawn the vehicle, the sound will simply cut off entirely and not return.The playable vehicles? just one wireframe dune-buggy looking thing...that's it.But the real issues come in the gameplay,it's a standard driving game,the ""Physics"" comes in the form of obstacles,speed-bumps,breakable barriers,loops etc...and in most areas the track has no walls,meaning you can fall off to your doom almost anywhere,with checkpoints few and far between.Now anyone who's ever played a game with a racetrack creator has probably at some point decided to make ""THA MOZT IMPOZZIBULL TRAKC EVARRRRRR!!! :D"" and proceeded to do so,only to realize that it wasn't any fun to slowly inch around a track avoiding hazards.Welp,there are hazards OVER THE ENTIRE TRACK! Most enjoy driving games for the sense of speed,but you have to plod through this too slowly to get any enjoyment...one tiny mistake and it's back to the last checkpoint...but hey,maybe you like obstacle courses?...you won't on this,as most obstacles are designed to infuriate you instead of providing fun or a challenge,thin rails to drive across,speedbump clusters that go on forever...obstacles that come up THROUGH the track as you drive over them...it's all pretty bad.......So...how are the  ""Physics""?Well,sometimes taking a speedbump slowly will send you flying into orbit,sometimes you'll lose all traction and slide off the road,sometimes you'll just fall THROUGH the road,and it seems if so much as one wheel isn't touching something solid,the other three wheels lose all traction...soo...yeah, this is a BIG PROBLEM! Especially on a course that requires precision.There's also the speed issue,as I said,you have to inch through this,but some areas require great speed,loops for example,however some don't have enough space in front of them to properly build up speed,others you can get the speed just fine,only to find a near unavoidable obstacle immediatly on the other side...given the track design, momentum is a constant issue,as you always either have too much or not enough. Also,when your vehicle falls off the track or wrecks you press R to respawn,but this sometimes glitches,for example:keeping your fall momentum and having you just bounce off the track at the respawn point,or respawning INSIDE of something. I'm sure there's more problems I've forgotten to mention,but you get the point.But through it all I persisted,to claim those sweet achievements and defeat this beast!!! However,the steam achievements...didn't work...I did what they say to do to unlock them,but nothing...NOT ONE worked.But whatever,did I beat the game? Well i got to the end...only to have one last obstacle,a block that appeared from beneath the track,pop up as I drove over it and flip me off the road...still determined I made my way back to find...the block was still there,blocking the exit...with no way around it...I tried respawning several times,but nothing would make it dissapear,so I was either glitched,or it was designed to where you had one shot to clear it. And while you have checkpoints,there is no save feature in this,so if I closed the game,i would have to start over from the beginning...I'M DONE!I  can only hope this was either someones first ever attempt at making a game,or a clever satire of how easy it is to get bad games published on Steam,but regardless this was HORRIBLE. Not a fun type of bad you can enjoy ironically,just pure BAD. So in conclusion...DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!			"

												If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												not worth the 50 cents i paid. so many glitches, physics are horrible, respawn doesnt even put up on the map half the time, the other half it puts you on upside down. the only way through the game is to be crazy lucky or drive super slow. not fun. im getting a refund out of principle.
