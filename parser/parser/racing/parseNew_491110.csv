												Look... it's a game where you're constantly in water,yet the water itself has just about 0 watereffects (it's like plastic foil with no ripples and splashes from anything you do).The textures are crude and the physics are wonky. Whatever gameplay is there isfunctional, at best, and incredibly basic.I picked this up as a joke more than anything else,and the game is far from 'great' (or even 'good').That said, it's also strangely charming and incredibly relaxing.I wasn't annoyed whenever the physics flipped out and did something stupid,because it's all so serene and completely stressfree anyways.The game is what you see on the store page.No more, no less - and as lacking as it may be,it can fill the spot of ""office game"" very well inthe place of solitaire or minesweeper.Toddlers may also get a kick out of it.Kids older than a couple of years will probably find ittoo boring though - which ironically suited me just fine.

Short version: 36%(If I could, I would use a ""neutral"" option in the voting.)On the surface, Duckie Dash doesn’t bode well: bad physics, repetitive levels, and plethora of level design oversights. Still, thanks to the lack of challenge, it is a surprisingly soothing little thing.Long version:Duckie Dash looks and feels like a cheap Unity asset store product. It is a time trial game, where the player has to navigate a little ducky through 3×10 courses, using slipstreams, geysers, and boosters, all the while avoiding some unfriendly beavers and whirlpools.Since there are no opponents and the par times are incredibly generous, the only hazard the player faces are the physics, or more like the lack of them: there is no acceleration, collision stops you instantly, and the water is more like some transparent jelly.Still, there is something soothing about playing a game with no chance to lose. Also, the stages are super short (30-180 seconds), so Duckie Dash can be used as something like a calming treatment, if you like these challengeless titles (and if its price drops to a reasonable level).

												I just had a great dad-daughter time with my 4 year old driving around a yellow duckie.  That worth $10?  Hell ya. "

												This game is the worst game I've ever paid $10 for. It should be $0.99, or free. It's horrible. ♥♥♥♥ Duckie Dash.			"
