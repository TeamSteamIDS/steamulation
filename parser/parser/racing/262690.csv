												Xbox Live Indie Game fans may remember Little Racers STREET from a year or two ago. The popular XBLIG title has now made its way to Steam with a few additions along the way. Little Racers STREET is a top down view arcade style racing game with a single player career mode and online multiplayer for up to twelve players.The racing action takes place over two ‘cities’ in which the tracks are created by blocking off road junctions to create a route. Think of it like the routes in games such as Need for Speed. This allows around 60 different tracks to race on, double that if you mirror them. The tracks range from short loop style routes to long ‘tour of half the map’ races. The cities are an urban area with scenery such as buildings and train tracks and the second a more open area with mountains and canyons providing the backdrop. To add some variety there are night and dusk lighting as well as rain and snow weather conditions which affect the vehicles handling. The two cities combined with the number of route permutations (around 200) means you won’t get bored of the tracks too soon.There are 41 vehicles to choose from, split into classes from E, the slowest, to A being the fastest. The classes are decided by four attributes; Power, Turning, Grip and Nitro. These can be upgraded in the garage, and if you upgrade enough you can even have the vehicle go up a class. The range of vehicles is good, from nimble mini’s and cumbersome buses up to super charged beasts, all of which can be painted and decaled. Depending on the type of race, speed is not always the best, as tracks can be very twisty so choosing a vehicle with lower speed and higher grip can make a massive difference.The career mode starts you with a small amount of money to buy a low class vehicle and get straight into the race. Depending on the race, you can be up against three to eleven other drivers. Credits are earned depending on the outcome and if you find your opponents too easy you can increase the difficulty to earn a larger reward. The AI is very competitive on the harder difficulties and one or two minor mistakes on the track will punish you. As you complete races your leaderboard ranking changes accordingly, it can be a bit of a grind working your way up the leaderboard and vehicle classes, but there is plenty to do.The multiplayer mode allows you to host, join or search for a race. A number of options are available if you are hosting a game including a choice of public or private games, number of vehicles and the race length. If you wish to, you can host a game and fill it with AI racers and play until some humans join the start of the next race. Surprisingly, you are unable to choose which track or conditions to race on. I haven’t spent any time playing multiplayer against other humans on the PC as the game had not yet been released on Steam, but I spent a lot of hours playing on the XBLIG version and I can assure you it is immense fun.The career mode will keep you busy for several hours as you progress through the classes. The multiplayer mode is where the lifespan is, get a few friends involved you can easily spend an evening racing against each other and inventing game modes such as ‘cops and robbers’ with differently painted vehicles and decals. If you enjoy racing games and simply want that arcade fun experience then this is a must buy. Gameplay: 8.5 A lengthy career mode with challenging AI if you increase the difficulty. Vehicle handling is spot on. The multiplayer mode provides many hours of enjoyment. Graphics: 8.5 Smooth 60FPS graphics which look nice, but often missed as you are tearing around the track. Sound: 7 A mix of music tracks which sound decent. Sound effects are sparse as expected in a racing game but they do the job. Final Score: 8.5 Review originally posted on Gamergeddon[www.gamergeddon.com] "

												Let's just put it out there.  Little Street Racers is just awesome and is the pinnacle of a genre that has sorely lacked any incarnation of excellence.   This literally little racer sports two imaginary cities in which 60 routes are spliced from and similar in design to Project Gotham Racing.   This is a polished piece of software sporting fluid frame rates, weather, varied environments, day and night racing, an online mode for up to 12 players, a single player campaign, multiple skill levels, a well designed AI, a damage model, time trial challenges with ghosts, multiple camera angles which include in track views, 6 performance tiers featuring cars with weight, a fun handling model, upgrades, paint jobs, nice graphics, achievements, a sense of speed, time trials, over 300 leaderboards (one for each class and track), trading cards ... and I'm sure the kitchen sink is to be found as well.  I'm floored and so is the gas pedal.  Easily one of the best indie products on the store.Addendum: Concerning the AI the developer has commented as follows:""The game has no rubberbanding (AI slowing down or being faster when they are ahead/after you) because I personally don't like that system. So yeah, the AI cars will do their best (within the set difficulty) all the race.""Addendum:  Little Racers STREET can be improved.   At the end of each career race show best lap and total race time and make the leaderboard accessible for the track and car class.  General filters are also needed for the huge number of leaderboards.			"

												Little Racers Street is an overhead racing game that still manages to be fun even if it has its own physics that let you turn or stop on a dime even in the most ridiculously fast cars. Its a game that's easy to play and tough to master the later courses thanks to the most 90 degree turns I've ever seen in a racer. This is street racing after all and most cities are built in a grid. On top of that you have a career mode that lets you buy cars and tweak them to your liking. If you upgrade them too much they will leave their class where the races face tougher competition..While this is an overhead racing game, there are several different camera angles to chose from. The default isometric camera is problematic, because as a street racer, there are buildings that will obscure your view. You have a setting to turn on a highlight that will show your silhouette, even when obscured, but the other cars still remain hidden and that's something that matters. There's a non isometric camera that falls into the same problems and an overhead chase camera that feels better than the other two.I have a feeling that Little Racers street was trying to be a kin to the old isometric racers like RC Pro Am and Heavy Metal Racing. Its more than the view, its the way the physics of the game. You still need to slow down in order to make a turn without bashing into something, but the turning is always sharp. I think that's what might scare people away. You'll need it though, because there can be a brutal number of hairpin turns back to back.The sharp turns are evidenced in the game's best camera  view of all is the one that betrays its gimmick in general and that's the chase cam. Your typical camera that follows the back of your car is by far the best way to play the game. Its just a great view that makes the game feel more like a modern racer. All of these camera angles can be changed on the fly when you realize how bad they are.The game controls as you might expect a racer to play and it controls well on a 360 controller even if the game says the nitro is the X button when its really the B button. The nitro feels weak and sounds weak, as if its a pneumatic arm from a carnival ride. Its slow to start and takes a while to reach its maximum velocity, so your best bet is to wait until your gauge is filled all the way.There are several different modes to chose from. Quick race that just drops you into a random vehicle in a random race. Free play lets you drive around either of the two cities. Time trials let you test your time against the world with online leader boards that rank you. There are even daily challenges, that are still being generated to this day. You can even play previous ones up to a week ago.The meat of the game is the campaign, which is where you'll be earning the money to buy cars. If you bump into walls or other cars you'll damage your car and that will affect your vehicle's performance, but more than that, it will cost you money after the race to have it repaired. Its a nice trade off and I was never able to fall into negative numbers. Its amazing how I can just about destroy my car, come in last place and repair it for a few hundred dollars, but if I were to come in first place, it would cost a few thousand. In other words, the game is lenient.From the look of it, the racers are about half the size they should be and this can be beneficial in races against eleven other drivers, you can still make your way past all of them at once. The barricades are taller than your car and if you try to cut a corner by driving over grass, you slam into it like a wall. You can slam into a wall at top speed and your car will bounce backward and fly you over a lane or so. Yet when you slam into other cars, its like hitting them with a pillow, because they hardly move. In a way its to cut out the dirty tactics, but in another its an overlooked part of racing.While the racers themselves might be little, the game itself relies on quantity over quality. There are an overwhelming fifty-five tracks in the game... oh wait, what's that? That's only the E class that has fifty-five courses? Oh my mistake. There are over three hundred tracks set in two small cities. Several of the courses feel similar and you'll be racing in the same areas over and over again, but since these courses are so disposable, you're never on them for long. Some courses last a minute, others can last three, it all depends on the amount of laps.The courses are flat for the most part with a road ripple here or there and a drive up a curvy mountain. Its just another reason to have more hairpin turns rather than 90 degree angles. There are a few jumps, but nothing spectacular. Even diving off of a highway to the street below seems lackluster.While using the chase camera, you get a chance to see the environment. It looks good from this angle. There are plenty of neon lights, but nothing that will overwhelm a person. The streets also shine as if they're made of polished marble and not asphalt. The pavement has arrows painted on them to ensure you're going the correct direction. That can be turned off, but there are a few races with a crossroad in the center. Some crossroads are obvious, others turn one direction or the other when you cross. So imagine a T combine with a Y.Each class has several different vehicles to purchase, each looks different and great. They all have some sort of character even if they're reasonable facsimiles you'd find in the real world. You'll find more than cars, there are hippy vans, old rustic trucks, street racers, muscle cars and even beetles.There are four different types of vehicles all geared toward the four stats which are power, turning, grip and nitro. The power consists of acceleration and top speed, but I wish they were different stats rather than combine as one. The nitro determines how fast your nitro gauge refills. Vehicles also can also have four-wheel drive or rear wheel drive as well. Its a rich amount of variety.Each course has a class restriction that limits you to race with cars of that class. This prevents you from being grossly overpowered. With that said, it does feel like I can purchase a D class vehicle, upgrade it almost to a C class and win more D class races races than I lose. The game will warn you if a vehicle is about to surpass its class. The C class races and beyond get much more challenging. There's a lot of human imperfection on my part that the computer benefits from.To diversify the races, there are day, dawn, dusk and night races coupled with environmental effects like snow and rain. These races are beneficial for four wheel drive vehicles, just as a lot of 90 degree turns are better for turning and grip.In terms of customization, you can select your vehicle's design and its color. It really makes the vehicle feel like your own. With all of this customization, you can purchase the same vehicle again and again to customize them differently. There's are two precise color sliders and dozens of designs.Why do color and design matter? Well the game has online multiplayer. Well dead online multiplayer, but if it was still a happening place to be, your car would look different than anyone else's. Even in the single player mode, each computer controlled vehicle looks different.Little Racers Street is a game with character and its own style. It walks a fine line between so bad that its good and so charming that its fun. Its a budget title and I imagine only a select few will look beyond its flaws and find a fun game. A great game? No, but still a fun, enjoyable game.			"

												If you like Isometric Racing games (a very sparce genre), then you might enjoy this. Otherwise, this game is very unlikely to make you a convert. The game is riddled with poor design decisions that include some excessive grinding. Additionally, visual feedback leaves much to be desired. You'll occasionally go off a jump that was nearly indistinguishable from regular road and be unable to turn while you're flying through the air. Add to this the fact that going anywhere near the walls of the track will lead to certain doom. Clip a cross street corner (even ones that appear to be blocked off by light walls) and you'll lose all speed and get passed by every single AI opponent. Be prepared for them to occasionally ram you in them as well. Worst of all is the fact that all on track feedback is the same color. Arrows point the way and are centered in the track in light neon blue. Also in neon blue are walls blocking off all other paths. When you're flying along (especially with the higher level cars) there is little time to react, this is where most racing games rely on level design to instinctively lead the player down the right path. The use of the same color for where you can and cannot go has caused more than a few frustrating crashes. Finally the fact that you are driving through the city means that view of the track and your car is occasionally obscured by buildings (usually several times per race). Had they had the buildings partially transparent when the camera view approaches, it would have been fine, but trying to turn corners or avoid cars blind is unbareable. Despite all this, the game is somewhat addicting, and it's obvious that the game had a lot of potential. It is disappointing that they squandered so much of it. I can't really recommend it, but it might be worth a try if you can get it at a discout.			"

												I got this game in Groupees ""Build a Greenlight Bundle 2"" a little less than a year ago, so the number of hours I've played on Steam is misleading. Little Racers STREET is a fun top-down racing game. It's simple in it's mechanics, and easy to get into. It has many different difficulty modes, the higher the difficulty, the more money you get, and the lower the difficulty, the less money you get. I found the difficulty settings in this game great. I'm absolutely terrible at racing, sports, and fighting games, but the difficulty settings in this game let me put it to a level that even I could call fair for my skill level.Basically, the point of the Career mode is to make your way to the top of the ranks. You start out with enough money to buy a E Class car, and perhaps a couple upgrades for it. Paint jobs are also free, which was nice.Multiplayer is a blast too. Being able to have 12 player races, and even filling slots with AI's is sweet.It's definitely no for simulation fans, which should have been immediately obvious from the screenshots, but it's a sweet arcade racing game that's definitely worth picking up.

												A top-down racer is rare nowadays. A FUN top-down racer is even more rare!Little Racers Street is all about fun. Anyone can pick up and play. It's easy to learn and hard to master.The career mode it's a bit grindy, but this isn't a problem, 'cos every race is in a different track and  there's a lot of replay value, with dozens of routes to ride. Did I mention that LRS it's addictive? Yes, it is! You'll always want to race one more track.The Metacritic score doesn't reflect the quality of this game today. Since release, a lot of stuff and fixes has been added. If you're after a nice arcade racer, LRS it's you choice.The only letdown is the lack of a local multiplayer mode.Other than that, you can't go wrong if you miss an excellent isometric racer.			"

												I will analyse this game as a Linux user...If you are in Linux, you know there are few good racing games available for this platform.So, with this context is LRS a good game? Yes, it is. Here you can find pretty fun races, with cool cars (they aren't licensed, but you'll recognize them) and reasonable graphics. The achievements are challenging and it'll make you play it for hours and hours.""But, I'm Windows/Mac user, should I buy it?"" Well, you'll have more racing options in these platform, but maybe you enjoy LRS anyway, I just don't know if for LRS' price you can't find a better game. But maybe you should buy LRS in a promotion.			"

												Of all the small racer games i have played this one is one of my favorites for long time playing. In the beginning when you play the game the graphics and modelling of cars is a bit meh as one may be accustomed to more cartoony racer games like Bang Bang or Mini Motor or even 'realistic' looking like Real World Racing. This game reminds me of the later Slicks'n'Slide games on the looks. Few liked those either. As you play the game starts to open up a bit and you start to like this more and more. Also filling up the garage with different cars and using them in various situations opens up entirely new scenarios that extends the experience. Career mode is grinding - lots of it as prices of cars and tuning parts are very high -  but still interesting as you buy and customize cars and do challenges using certain types of cars. There is always something to aim towards to. Best part is probably multiplayer design. You can just put it on and either pop into someones game or host it yourself and keep on playing and if someone joins then they just join and there is no change to ever flowing races that keep on rolling with 5 sec lobby wait intervalls. No need to separate Career, achievement hunting or multiplayer. This is a brilliant idea from the devs as they probably knew multiplayer is going to be dead anyways so why not make it as open as possible to encourage social playing. No other racing game in my library has this. Others - that i have tested atleast - force you to wait in a lobby hoping that someone might pop in. Dead wrong! That does not work. MP is dead - universally - everyone is playing whatever is the genre leader. iRacing, Dota, whatever... dont even know if this particular sub-genre has a game that 'everyone plays' ?Daily challenges keep one entertained too. Very tough times to beat there. but not impossible to reach a relatively high position either. i seem to score world spots 3-5 all the time so it can't be that bad. Controls are spotless and car turns precisely like you want it. And getting good lap times is purely about skill. 9/10 - This one takes a well deserved spot in my library along with Mini Moto Racing Evo which is another game that i regard very high. Points could be perhaps a bit higher if the awesome MP section would be even more open and certain menu items and in game indicators would be more clearer. edit: some extra words removed that did not belong anywhere			"

												Top-down racing games in more recent years have been very hit and miss affair more often than not missing the 'fun factor' that makes this sort of game appealing. Little Racers STREET is an exception, although basic in respects to lacking the powerups & weapons often seen in the genre, the straight racing aspect is very enjoyable. You have good control over your car through the hundreds of combinations of tracks created through two larger city block maps. Having just the two main locations though, does result in some lack of variety on the scenery & terrain front.The selection of camera views, from more traditional top-down to the more modern chase views let you play how you want - you could even play this more like a third person racer if you wanted! The career mode is extensive, with lots of challenges to complete & cars to unlock as you work your way up the classes from E to A. Racing really starts to become fun from Class C onwards as this is when you need to start using brake/handbrake and drift around more. Cars can also be upgraded and you can modify the paint & pattern. There is no story or anything exciting to mention in career mode, rather more of a 'grindy' career covering things like .. win xx races, win xx races with xx car - same goes for most of the achievements. You can progress the career mode online which makes it more challenging and also more fun than racing the AI.Races are quick, generally lasting just a few minutes but this suits the gamestyle - this can be increased in multiplayer mode only if you host. Playing against your friends is where this becomes the best fun but online against others is still a fun challenge. Thankfully the multiplayer doesn't suffer from an nasty bounce corner moves or other dirty play but do expect some fast drivers! Since the LRS has only just been released at time of writing this, it is not too hard to find an online game currently (will have to wait and see if the community hangs around). There is no way to select your track or setup a tournament through multiplayer which is a bit of a let down.It's an XBox Live port but has been programmed well for a change for the PC with detailed graphics & smooth camera work. It's not perfect but it is pretty good.There were some things that I didn't like so much, such as the sound effects and music were bland; nothing great. Music selection is limited/repetitive and car sounds and impacts are pretty basic to my ears. Also, all the AI racers feel the same, follow same paths and make the same mistakes - there are a few tracks you will easily win due to AI crashing out on a corner every time getting stuck. Harder AI simply seemed to mean they have faster cars putting you at a clear disadvantage - no better drivers as such which makes the harder difficulty not more challenging just more frustrating!Some more variety in game modes would have been good too. Given the cityscapes a timed live-route mode (ala Grid 2) would have been great along with other skill challenges such as how fast you could go without hitting anything. More jumps (bigger jumps!), more elevation, more race shortcuts, more drifting & various hazards all would add so much to the experience. It has the basics in gameplay well refined which is thoroughly enjoyable, but falls short of being a classic due to the limitations I mention above. Still worth checking out if you like these sorts of games, good value and is one of the better ones on Steam!!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												I am not a motor head, nor do I normally play racing games of any sort, but I had a really good time when playing Little Racers. A top down view gives you a good over view of the course a head of you, allowing you time to plan out your corners. Single player mode consists of a career mode, where you start out with a very basic car, and you work your way up the ranks while earning enough money to buy yourself one of the super cars. You can also spend the money you earn from winning races to upgrade your car with all the normal stuff such as better grip or a bigger nitros tank. This is a very watered down version of a racing game, but I still enjoyed it very much. One that you could probably enjoy playing alot while sitting on the couch in the front room as it works very well with the controller. This is worth your time even if you aren't a fan of racing games like me.			"

												There are alot of racing games out there.  The music in this game is great, but the tracks are small, as in sure they can be long but I mean there are so many turns so close together its like their ""Little Racers"", that is the name of the game.  The game works flawlessly, I had a hard time figuring out where turns were since the screen seems zoomed in a bit much and the turns appear very fast out of nowhere often leaving me flying right into walls.  I think it coulda been more fun if the cars bounced off obstacles instead of coming to a complete halt.  This game uses blue arrows to tell you where to go, thats great, but the walls you crash into are blue, so it messes with your eyes.  Telling you to watch for blue and aim for it but sometimes you just crash into it.  When you finish a lap GIANT TEXT appears on the screen saying FASTEST LAP, in the worst place, right over your car and taking up the whole screen, is this a game or some experiment by the mad hatter?  Whats worse is there are buildings in the game that block your view of the race.  Its like your playing a game like its a selfie with someone standing in the way most of the time.  Ugh.... have mercy!Rating:  5/10  Value:  $1.99			"

												Update. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After some adjustments and driving the whole day I have made a small update. No doubt, the best handling ever in a top down racer, even the best handling ever for a racing game. The engine audio is cool when you drive above class E cars. The heavy bunch of various challenges, and the solutions to settle achives and the challenges I just have seen better before. This top down racer, is a absolutely must have game. GO FOR IT!!! ------------------------------------------------------By request I made this short little rewiev.---------------------------------------------------------------Short rewiev:First and best of all:The handling must be one of the best I have ever tried in a top down racer.The price.-------------------------------The audio is terrible, the horn is useless and mostly annoying, like the boost sound and a weak standard engine sound.GFX are ok, but cant compare with MMRE, and BANG BANG RACING.The challenges and the numbers of cars seems to be nice.I just tried the multiplayer part with | Pytox |, it runs like a charm Im extited to see more friends to participate.The camera views can be a little tricky, the chase camera tho feels like a winner, and overall the angels are pretty cool.---------------------------------------------------------------Overall:I just played for a couple of hours, but until know I consider it is a ""must have"" for top down racers fan.GOGOGO!!!Low price.

												Not a bad little game. I heard the game was from the XBOX 360 edition of it but don't have a console so I can't complain. Game does play in a fun manner. Although I find the physics a bit questionable at times and the way the cars turn on the track is funny. Not much detail as far as the cars on the track go.From the looks of this game, if you mixed Micro Machines with Need For Speed you would get this game. Except its like its playing in a need for speed world. Developer did good to produce something original , but it can improve on features and playability.			"

												At first when I saw this game I was reminded Super Off Road or RC Pro Am (on NES) and was hoping for something similar. I got it, and I got a little more.Definitely what is shown on the trailer is the basis of what this game is. It's a top down sort of racer with dynamic camera angles that definitely make up the game. The first camera angle reminds me somewhat of Super Off Road,RC Pro Am, or Sim City 3 when you take control of vehicles. Not a bad angle, and a good one for nostalgic feel. However, some problems persist with views as you'll see buildings get in your way. None the less an outline of your car is shown but sometimes it is difficult to see. Which brings me to the next camera angle which is dynamic and shows you more of the track ahead of you. The variety of camera angles adds depth to the game. One would think of course seeing your player would be of utmost importance. It is but it adds to the game play. The driving itself is relatively simple and reminds me of literally having a toy car between my fingers (which is not a bad thing). For a grown man I like the game for the grown-up feel it gives but I like it at the same time sort of bringing me back in time when games were simpler (such as Pro Am or Off Road). The driving handles great and the ability to see if you beat your best track time is made even easier. Nitro is also a big factor within the game and when to use it. I find even playing at medium difficulty you may come in first a lot, but there will be some races where it will feel sort of inconsistent and you'll find yourself having a hard time catching up to first. Damage is sort of negligible but I'm only on class D and as the cars get faster more damage may occur. Damage of course has to be paid after each race. After completing races there are achievements such as completing every course on a certain racing level. There are credits rewarded in career mode after racing which enables cars to be upgraded or new ones to be bought. There is even a free roam mode to choose from! That's pretty sweet!The visuals are suitable to this game, and maybe in a few places could have been better. I like the fact that toy cars were used. Cars have a custom paint option. It's almost like having my micro machine toy car the color I've always wanted it. It's not need for speed detail but it's enough detail to keep the game cool. The sounds are decent, nothing too amazing but nothing short of good. When the guy says final lap or new best time it sort of sounds off. Either than that no complaints.I like this game and would like to see a DLC or something added. Maybe add weapons in the game and make it like mario kart? Why not a demolition mode? I'd suggest more things but I'm not getting paid here for them. (Cop chases anyone)? This is a good game... I like this game so obviously it will get a good rating. I bought it on sale and if it suits you I'd recommend buying it. Sucks that it isn't local co-op but I can see why (would be hard seeing each car). Food for thought though! There is a bit of a grind with career mode when it comes to getting new cars but the races are short and enjoyable enough that you won't notice, until you start getting to later classes where prices are high. The bonus of it is that some races have a pretty big pay-out. If you don't care for some achievement or potential card opportunity then just keep on going to the horse races. Could have been easily an 8 if more game modes were added.RATING : 7.1/10. Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-Also the multiplayer seems to be somewhat alive at certain times. Either than that it can be pretty quiet. Buy a four pack?			"

												This is a Racing Game Top-Down Style.This games also brings me back to the '90 era.Codemasters released another Micromachines game and this really looks a lot of the way it plays and looks.Only big difference is that the game takes place at some street racing underground.More than 55 cars to drive with in 6 difference tears.The controls a really need to get used to.Because of the feeling how the cars steers en how the point of view is.There are some difference between cars only you will not notice it a lot.The game offers you have different game possibilities.You have Single Race, Career, Time Trail, Free Roaming and Multiplayer.Career mode is really the most fun to play and race over 190 events on 60 different tracks.You think you are fast you must try the Time Trail Mode. Free Reaming is very special for a game like this and it's a really fun and good addon to this games and 2 Huge cities to drive onMultiplayer can be used offline and online to play with friends experience for up to 12 players.Graphically the game looks pretty good. And even weather conditions to participate in this game.This gives the game new difficulty rating.Game has some also have some good background music.In short it's a very solid game that can be a little addictive to play.I really enjoy this game... and only for 5.99 retail ?So it's possible to buy fun and good game only if you ask me they are very rare.It's a good game is you like top-down racing games.I will give it a 7/10.

												Little Racers STREET is a top-down view arcade racing game that does exactly what it says. It's a fun little game, but is a mixed bag for me personally.This game is meant to be played from the top-down perspective, BUT this game is unplayable at some points, especially later down the road when you get the super fast cars. Buildings and other obstacles can block your view, even worse when there happens to be a corner that you have to take right there and slam taking damage. Thankfully there is a chase cam, but then you can clearly see how bad this game looks. There isn't even a skybox. Just a grey/black void above you at all times. Going into the chase cam also makes this game a cakewalk, providing you can get past the AI.This game only really has 1 gamemode. Race the AI on a random selection of 5 tracks. The game will randomly select 5 races which will be random classes (depending on what class of vehicles you have.) You race on them, and try to win. Your reward is credits and Ranking points (for single player leaderboard.) There is no real ""End Goal"" in this game sadly. You just keep racing the same courses, just maybe you take a different vehicle. There is also a Time Trail, Freeroam, and Daily Challenges. There is 12 player multiplayer, but it's dead.The AI is stupid and can be unfair. The 1 AI that is always meant to win will ALWAYS have a better vehicle then you. I even tried to replicate the exact vehicle the AI would use per class, even upgrading to to where I could not anymore before it got kicked to the next higher class, and yet the AI was still faster and able to hit the corners better. Upon playing on the higher classes, you can really see the downfall of the AI. The AI gets faster cars, but still tries to drive them like they are still in the slower cars. They don't slow down or brake going into the corners, so they always slam into the walls, wreaking their vehicles before they can even get half way through the race. It's even a bigger joke when you race them on the snow tracks. The AI also tend to love ramming you into walls. This sucks on harder levels, which I will say why later on.LRS has 2 worlds that are populated with more than 200 tracks between them, that have normal, rain, and winter tracks. Each style of level also has slightly different ways on how vehicles handle in the weather, snow obviously having low handling and let's you slide around the map like nothing. This is great in terms of content, but the worlds are not that big, and start to get very repetitive. The cites are empty, there is nothing in them. There isn't anything interesting in them. Playing on Freeroam is pointless, because there is NOTHING! All there is in the game is race the AI or race other players (but the MP is dead.) After a few hours it starts to get boring. There is nothing else, just race AI, try the Time Trials, and ""Daily Challenges"" which is basically Time Trials again. Good luck trying to beat Dev times, but I just suck at racing games.The amount of different cars to select is really good. You can buy cars from the ""Store"" or unlock cars by completing challenges (Win so may races driving the ____, Win so many D Class races, etc.) You can ever upgrade your cars to do better, or even upgrade them to the next class. I was able to get all the cars up to B Class, then it got to the point everything was too expensive to really purchase, and would take a few days of grinding to achieve them. The vehicles have 4 stats: Speed, Handling, Grip, and Boost. This is where I've encountered that certain vehicles start out WAY to OP for the game. Any vehicle that has high grip and handling can easily beat most races as they can turn on a dime and not lose any speed. On the higher classes it because ridiculous on how unbalanced it is. Taking them on the winter levels is fun as you can drift every corner without trying and lap the AI without any trouble. Your vehicles can also receive damage during the races. Receiving damage will slowly make your vehicle slower and handle worse. Fully damaging your vehicle makes you lose the race. After each race, you will be deducted so many credits to fix your vehicle based on how much your car is worth and how much your car was damaged. This is a good concept, BUT in the later A class races, where your cars cost $2,000,000+, this makes getting money impossible. Most races in A class on Normal Difficulty net you about 300k, but just one SCRATCH on your A class car can cost you 50k. This being added with the AI loving to be smash happy, you will be lucky to get even $1000 after the race. You can also customize the paintjob on all your vehicles as well, though it is very basic. Chose a decal/design and change the colors.There is no options menu to speak of. It's very basic. It has OK sounds but will get annoying. It has 1 music track and it's horrible, but you can turn it off.As you can see this is a very mixed bag for me. But I only spent maybe 0.50¢ so I can't complain too much. Most people that I've noticed that gave this a positive review never actually made it to the later classes to experience how unbalanced the game is. You won't be able to get a class A car in only a few hours. It took me about 5 hours to get my first A class car.Pros:- Lots of tracks- Lots of cars to select- Runs at a smooth 60FPS- Loads real fast, easy to jump in a race within seconds- Will probably run on a potato- Achievements- Steam CardsCons:- Outdated graphics- Repetitive races/tracks- Only 2 areas- Empty Worlds- Stupid/unforgiving AI- Dead MP- Pointless FreeRoam Mode- Car Stats are not well balanced- Sub-par sounds and horrible musicFor a company that later goes and creates one of my most favorite Dungeon-Crawling FPS games Ziggurat, you can see they grew and learned a lot and can truly make great games.

A very good racing game where the more you play it the worse it gets...The game starts off really, really fun -- you're entry level Class E racing car.  Paint it your desired two-tone pattern in whatever colors and pattern you like, and upgrade it if you wish as you earn money.  The races are also very well done -- a variety of weather to include rain and snow and many, many variety of maps.  Then after each race which is anywhere from 3 to 12 laps or so depending on the length of each lap, you can see how you ranked against the world, which I think is great -- I love leaderboards, as they push you on and add some replay value.The downside for me, though, started with Class C.  Class E is a lot of fun and Class D was more of a balanced challenge and still a lot of fun.  Class C, though, good grief.... Cars are going through subdivisions at 160+ mph making hair pin turns and over 250 mph on the straightaways.  It suddenly become a lot LESS fun when the physics is so ridiculous and it's now become a ""twitch racer"".  On Class C's, B's, and the few Class A tracks I raced you have to start turning before the turn is even visible on the screen.  Class C is ""playable"" for those determined, but just.On the good side:+ Good AI opponents, from 3 to 11 computer cars running around the track with you.+ Excellent variety of tracks.  Class E alone has over 50 tracks, and some of the Classes had over 70 tracks.+ Nice variety of environments / maps.  The tracks are spread across several different cities, and each track is certain selection of roads on that city map.  Excellent.+ Class E and D are simply a lot of fun+ Skid marks remain on trackOn the OK side:~ Sounds could have been better.  Such as the sound of the dam on certain maps / tracks uses the sound effect for a running stream -- doesn't match.~ There are a few hills, but it's too hard to tell if it IS a hill or a slight turn in the road.  Misjudged many times until I just learned to recognize that part of the map.~ Both odd and unclear when selecting a track.  When starting out a race, you are presented with 5 tracks to pick titled E1-E5.  The next race you are again presented with E1-E5, but they're different tracks.  There's no explanation of what it's doing or why.  It's just confusing.  I just pick the first one I haven't raced before (as it lists that number in the race track details) and go.~ Weather mostly only affects traction.  A ""slight"" graphic tweak but other than that you hardly notice any difference -- you still race at basically the same speeds and no real change to racing style.~ In Classes D and E, the more damage your race car has, the slower your race car now goes.  It is manageable though as you crash less often due to traveling slower and more time to react.  And when you do crash less speed = less damage to car, thus not as big of an impact (so to speak) on your car's top speed or acceleration.On the bad side:- Everything becomes way WAY too fast to be enjoyable any more, which causes a wide variety of problems / issues I have with the game- Game turns into a ""Twitch racer"".  If you see something enter your screen, you have to immediately react to it or its too late.  In higher classes, it probably IS already too late.- Little forgiveness of player mistakes in later classes.  On the higher classes, play nearly perfect or enjoy loosing.- The physics become just too broken for me to enjoy it.  Cars go from 0 to 150 in like 1.5 secs; cars can make hairpin turns at over 100 mph....  this makes a player mistake in a race basically a podium-ending event, as while the player can accelerate quickly after the crash, all the speed was lost and also your car is briefly thrown into the air for a few more 'punishing' seconds.- In Classes C and up, the more damage your car has the slower it goes.  The problem is, you're now going so much faster with less reaction time, you naturally crash a lot more.  Crash more at these levels and you are now getting LAPPED.  This is the only race car game ever where I got lapped by the computer, and there's not that many laps... Overall, I do recommend the game -- just stay in the Class E and D classes and have fun.  By Class C the game is no longer any fun at all for me and become ""work"".  If speed / physics was reduced to more realistic levels, the game could easily be a 80%+ game score...  as it is, I'd give it a 60% which is a little generous considering how miserable the later classes were for me.

												A good little racing game that could have been great and even become a cult classic as Micro Machines once did. If the visual execution and the gameplay feeling of an arcade racer are skillfuly done, there are too many flaws that cannot be simply overlooked. Some are detrimental to the game, some just minor details. From bad to worse:- The algorithm that randomize each race does not seem to adjust the number of racers to the size of the race, transforming some of them into stock car racing where you spend a lot of your time shouting ""Get out of the *@%*$ way"" at your screen, which was not my idea of the game. Unless it was endorsed by NASCAR, which it is not.- The AI racers become more skilled after each lap (so do you, which is a good kind of balancing), but over 10 laps (the random factor allows 15+ laps races), the other racers attain near-perfection driving, forcing your loss in a way. That and some cars seem to be over-powered compared to the category you're in (but maybe that's just me being a bad driver).- The game has a lot of grinding built in, just so you know.- The general visibility is sometimes broken by too much information (a lot of cars, scenery, lighting...) and you'll be confused wondering whose car you're driving (unless you painted it flashy pink with lime green bands just to recognize it). The track readability is not that great either. Plus, parts of the background will be in front of your eyes, blocking the street and the cars from your view. Which is dumb, the background is fine where it is... in the back.- Your car will bounce off random edges. Some you will see (sidewalks), some that are invisible according to the way the track is divided. The fact that any car with a certain velocity will lose its momentum and bounce back is beyond my comprehension though.That's a long list but I still like this game. I'm just disappointed because it could have truly been a magnificient one with a few tweaks. Maybe the next one will be better. "

												I play this game pretty much everyday.  I can not reccomend this game enough if you are a racing fan.  They have time trials for every track.  Which gives you something to shoot for after you have completed all of the regular game play.  I call it regular game play where you have to race each class to earn money to buy new cars and buy upgrades.  Then you have a daily challenge where you have up to 24 hours to get your fastest lap in and see how you did against everyone else that played that day.			"

												It is quite fun. It should be a bit more 'big' however like more realistic car names and some new, bit more sunny maps should be included. And the normal camera view should be a default (or at least an easy to find option) since everybody who wants a 'normal' car simulator likely will disregard this game since they will think that the isometric/'bird point of view' view is the only option. But after you set it properly it is a really fun arcade car simultor game.			"

												This game is great! Never had so much fun with a racer since glorious ""Super Cars I + II"" on my Amiga back in the dayz (and that means A LOT of days) !!!09/10 but only because it's not possible to import new car patches or textures and there is no ingame text chat. I think voice chat is there for those who like it ... I don't ... so I don't care for that ...And there are so many nice people playing this game.

												Probably one of my favourite racing titles for PC. It's like if Death Rally had a cool cousin that wasn't into weapons and violence.You can quickly jump into a quick race if you are not into grinding your way into earning money for your career cars or jump into career mode and buy lots of cars, paint them up, fine tune them and race on select tracks. The game looks visually pretty too and I'd very much recommend a Xbox 360 controller to play but it isn't required. The thumping electro music is pretty darn awesome too to race with!Only downside is that I couldn't find any Multiplayer action going on but the single-player is just as fine with difficulties from Easiest up to Unfair.

												Really fun little racing game! You earn credits from racing and there's a ranking system as well as different car tiers so there's always a lot to do. Was bedridden and this game kept my attention all day, it's simple but as the game progresses, in career mode you can race 20 rounds to receive a next tier car (better performance stats), but as tiers get higher your opponents also have higher tiered cars and the race gets extremely fast paced!One thing I really love about this game as well are the different camera views, you can have the camera rotate and follow you, or from above, or let it just be top down and not rotate, a total of 5 or 6 options? Also the different weather conditions give each round a fresh feel too, for example snow and rain make the tracks slippery or make you go faster and you will have to adjust to that.Played some multiplayer but haven't actually tried out connecting with Steam friends, but they let you choose stock cars if you don't own a car of the tier that your opponents have so they don't have an unfair advantage. Overall a neat, simple but fun game with plenty of reason to keep playing.			"

												What is not to like about an arcadey top down racer like Little Racers Street.  The controls feel great and the game is especially fun in multi-player.  There is a gremlin that occasionally gets the finishing order somewhat wrong which can be really mystifying but with a game that is this fun who would care what the correct finishing order was anyway.  This game is a laugh a minute and a good adrenaline rush.  The most fun to be had, and comparable to watching a Koi fish and an electric eel mud wrestling.This game invites memories of Super Cars, Super Cars 2, Super Sprint, Super Sprint 2 and Ivan ""Iron Man"" Stewart.The graphics is good, the sound is good, the game play is exceptionally good, but the score keeper seems a little untrustworthy :)			"

												I love this game!Going in my expectations were that I would spend an hourish playing another cheap, flash game quality, mobile port. The kind of experience only really enjoyable when sitting on the toilet. In most regards, that’s exactly what this title looks like; yet it still caught my attention somehow.I think the charm comes from the fact that it takes me back to when I was little and pretended to race hot-wheels cars. The way all the cars handle and interact reminds me very much of all the silly drifts and hairpin turns I would do racing around the living room.For looking and feeling like something you would find on sites like Newgrounds, there is a lot of content. There are two large worlds with tons of tracks, plenty of cars (even though many feel like filler and only a handful are truly practical), and all of the car upgrades truly make a difference in the way you will need to drive. The difficulty is the main sore spot I’ve found with the game. The “medium” difficulty is generally a cake walk yet randomly will ramp up to insane races. “Hard” is genuinely challenging yet on certain tracks or with inclement weather the AI just breaks.Despite it’s appearance, Little Racers STREET is awesome and a great buy if you’re looking for a simple bit of blissful arcade racing.

												Dunno if I'm the best person to talk about this game, since I like top-down racers a lot. For me, this game is proof that you don't need sophisticated perks or state-of-the-art graphics to make a nice game.The graphics, even though simple, feel just right for the genre, the controls also feel pretty good and the game itself really grows in you. The custom-built engine is really light, works fine and makes it the kind of game you can play in any laptop or pc right now (which is really a GOOD thing).Sure, there are a few things that could be improved, like the camera and a little bit of the soundtrack/sounds, but overall this game is really nice and fun! :)			"

												It's not a bad game for what it is, gameplay is simple and addictive, and the visuals are.... Nice? Still, there are some flaws that I will proceed to list:- Sometimes, the HUD actually gets in the way, your car loves hiding behind it in some parts of certain tracks, which can be pretty damn annoying.- The music is not really that bad, but it's pretty bland, hit or miss. I personally use my own playlist.- The game is randomized when it comes to tracks and even racers you will be going against. It's not that bad, but sometimes, the races are way too easy when you have 3 other cars in a long, long race. That's not too bad, but then....- ....Sometimes, it's totally the opposite, and that's when it gets annoying. You are racing against 9 or so other cars in a small ♥♥♥ circuit, which gets you screaming ""GET THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF MY WAY"" more often than you would like to. It's like a ♥♥♥♥ing nascar race. - The game's got some kind of weird rubber banding. You can actually leave the other racers way behind, they won't catch up with you in 2 seconds most of the time. But each time you cross the finish line, each lap, the AI gets stronger, better, faster, but not harder. If you are struggling to keep up with the other racers BEFORE the second to last lap, you are ♥♥♥♥ed, my friend.-  This is actually pretty rad. Sometimes, the enemy racers get stuck in certain corners of the track, and they will stay there, motionless, until you, or somebody else, is gentle enough to nudge it out of the twilight zone....-...Of course, this can happen to you, also. You won't get stuck there for a whole lap, but your top speed will get screwed up when you hit A SINGLE PIXEL IN THE WAY! COME ON! - 10-16 lap races. Just....Avoid these. With the rubber banding AI that gets stronger each lap, you won't finish in first, second, third, or even fourth place unless you are really, really skilled, and also, lucky. It's just a waste of time. Avoid. - If you are like me, an average driver, you will have lots of trouble staying away from the walls. Which means you will have to pay for repairs. How much? Just like 80% of your race money. Dear god, another grindfest. All in all, this game isn't terribly bad, but it's not....That good neither. It's just one of those games you play now and then, or in worst case scenario, play once and never touch it again. Judge for yourself, if you dare.			"

												With Death Rally (the original developed by Remedy I mean, not the remake you can get on Steam) being free and working on any modern Windows version, you would think that making a game like this would be as easy as downloading it, and then playing it a whole lot until you get what is that made this genre great.What you get instead is games like Little Racers Street, where I can't help but feel like the dev team said, OK we're going to make the game we want eventually, but in the meanwhile we need some cash: so they watched youtube videos of classics while thinking about what they're going to have for dinner that day, and after some time lo and behold they've cobbled together a Cargo science version of the classics.Superficially, they LOOK more or less the part, but play like crap. Little Racers STREET has a sloppy presentation, it almost looks like it could be a freeware game from a few years ago and to say the music is place-holder is to be generous. But the handling? the handling, I hear you ask? It's vacuous at best, and the career progression is grindy. The only good thing I can say about it is that the AI is not as murderous as Mini Motor Racing EVO (that would be, throw your controller at the screen degree of vicious). And that's about it.Save yourself a few cents and play Death Rally (the free one by Remedy if you don't mind my repeating). Or Slicks'n'slide. Or ATARI's Super Sprint or Ironman Super Offroad: I can guarantee those are good games and if you don't like them, well it means the genre isn't for you. This? This is just going for the nostalgia angle.			"

												Little Racers Street... Where to begin. There are plenty of games out there with the same gameplay principle: isometric arcade racing. There are cars to buy and upgrade, and races to win. We've seen it all before.The graphics get the job done, but the vehicles could use a lot more detail. Yes, even with an isometric view and especially when you're picking a car to drive.It's a solid racer, and it plays quite alright with a controller connected.If you have enough money buy a better racer instead, but if you want a cheap, fun little racer then Little Racers Street is just the thing for you.[Rating: 66/100]			"

												...okay i've hardly touched this game and have to give you all a heads up, because so far there's a lot to say. i'll update this review later.i bought this game on sale for 6.39 USD. i've been without a decent racing game for awhile other than having recently started playing RPM racing for SNES again... and saw this on steam and figured it was worth a shot from the reviews/description.even without the sale, this game is worth the full price of 7.99 USD (or whatever it costs in your native currency). getting it on sale is just a bonus for if you can't really afford it at full price or have trouble justifying buying non-sale games.  it's very well-executed in every way and there's really nothing bad i can say about this cheap little indie game made for hardcore and casual arcade racing fans alike. my review for this game was too long to post so i just deleted pretty much all of it to say it gets a 10/10 and i'll update with why later. if you want a decent arcade racer mixed with old-school top-down racers... get this game. it's NOT EXPENSIVE and it's just as enjoyable as the console big-boys in its own ways. ok maybe not as enjoyable as a good BURNOUT game since you can't crash your wrecked car into others... but still!

												One of the best games on Xbox Indies has finally made it to PC and now it's shinier than ever. This game is simple and reminicent of Micro Machines' top down arcadey racing. There's no weapons, it's all about taking the corners just right and timing your boost.			"

												Before you set out to buy this game you should have the intention at hand to have a little fun. Is say this without a shadow of humour intended since this is not a game with a story line. Some might call it a time waster. I on the other hand like to call it a great new concept in the world of racing since this combines both a 3D and a very familiar top down easy to learn racing approach.The game is simple enough all the way through. Buy a car, upgrade it and get the best car through the process of doing many races around many a map. The races give you money, etc. All very typical stuff. The thing I admire is the total lack of a ""loser"" attitude. That's what makes it fun. If you've ever played Need For Speed then you'll know how frustrating it is to receive the ""you lose"" message after you don't come first in a race. Here on the contrary it doesn't matter at all. You receive a particualr amount of money based on your position in a particular race (and did I mention how you have to pay for the damage done to your car during a race?). This in turn allows you to ""progress"", you could say, to buy new types of faster cars for your garage which you can then race against the same classes of cars.I like this system. In this way races never seem to be unbalanced seeing as how once you've upgraded your car to a new class that car can no longer partake in races for anything but its own class. In fact I see this as a massive boost to online multiplayer as well. From my experience it has made me want to continue racign with the cheaper and lower class cars throughout my game time. To achieve a feat like that is not easy as many games have shown us.Because of how this game emplores an ""ariel view"" approach (not quite top down) you really get a chance to look around and admire the scenery created for this game and because you can constantly choose the track that you will play it stays interesting throughout. The difficulty modes means that whatever level gamer you are you can have fun and the rewards for the higher difficulties are not over exagurated, thus making this a balanced, fun and beautiful game.Of course this game also has achievements and trading cards and costs almost nothing at all. I would defintiely recomend giving it a go!			"

												I've enjoyed playing Little Racers STREET in general but I don't think I can recommend it. I find the core of the game, the driving mechanic, fun. But. Unfortunately there are some really bad design choices implemented which hinder this game from being actually good.There is no one playing online, which is not exactly the game's fault, but I think it's fair to note that the online play is practically dead so you are forced to play Career mode.There are multiple car performance categories ranging from E to A, A being the highest. If you start career mode (which is a bit grindy, not too bad though) you buy an E category car. If you keep upgrading your car it will bump up into the next category (D in this case) and you will instantly be matched up against much stronger opponents which you most likely won't be able to beat (because your car has now become a very low performing category D car). I find this aspect kind of silly. Another issue I have is that you can never leave the road in a race and the terrain surrounding the roads will always act the same way if you hit it. Let me elaborate why this can be very annoying. If you approach a turn and you try to take the most efficient curve, but you miss this curve a slight bit and you accidentally hit the corner (even if it is just grass or snow, no hard terrain whatsoever) in the wrong way you will bounce back from it instead of just going over it.Another problem is the damage cars take. It wouldn't be a huge problem in itself, but cars get damaged in a way that's really lazily designed. You basically get a damage meter going up if you hit something. The ridiculous thing is that It doesn't matter if you just touch one of the other cars or you crash frontally into a building, it does the same amount of damage. It will basically build up one damage ""tick"" from every crash (or slight touch) you make. On top of it, even moderately damaged cars take a lot of money to repair so it adds to the grindiness and it is just an annoyance in my opinion.This point is linked to the previous one. When you get to the highest category (A) you supposedly get a lot of cash for winning races, but what happens in reality is that category A cars take so much to repair that you are better off playing category B races because you get more net money there. This could have easily been fixed and again, it is just very lazy from the devs to leave it like this.My last gripe is that in Career mode if you wish to play you click on ""Race"". It brings up a little menu with 5 races to choose from. However, it is a bit random what category races you will be presented with and you might not get to play with your highest ranked car because there is no race available for it currently. You could say that it adds a bit of variety to the game, but in all honesty, the only difference between the categories is performance so it is just silly that you have to play races with your worse performing cars again.Pros: Driving is fun Quite a few cars to choose fromCons: Progression between performance categories is weird and unfun Strange physics model, you unexpectedly bounce back from terrain you wouldn't expect to The damage model is designed very lazily, which leads to increased annoyance thanks to the high repair costs You earn less net cash from the highest category races than from the one below Online play is practically nonexsitent "

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/little-racers-street-first-impressions/Little Racers STREET is a top-down racing game, originally released on Xbox under the name “Little Racers”. The game doesn’t seem to have anything going for it, other than the fact that its the first game like this that I’ve seen on Steam. Other than that, it’s a rather generic game.The controls are responsive when using a controller. These types of games go best when used with one, don’t even bother using keyboard controls. I probably wouldn’t recommend the game if it only supported use of mouse and keyboard. The game is top-down, so expect some getting used to in terms of turning in the game. I got the hang of it almost instantly, due to my prior experience in games like this, mainly back when I played a ton of games on my old iPad (I remember a game called “Death Rally” that was similar to this, minus the guns).The game fails to set itself apart from all other similar titles, however. It just felt like your generic top-down racing game. Nothing too special, although this is the first game like this I’ve played in years. If you’re looking for straight-up racing, no gimmicks, then Little Racers STREET is for you. If you’re looking for a unique experience, you may want to turn elsewhere.			"

												Addictive, challenging game. Becareful how much you upgrade your car, you can make the mistake i did at first, and class up your car before you are ready. Luckily there is a downgrade feature which i think is very nice, you can downgrade the car to keep it within a certain class or to change how the car is set up. The graphics are nice, handling physics is a bit odd but fun once you get used to it. I'd say it is both a mix of sim, and arcade. You have to figure out a good rhythm for the corners. How you boost on the straights matters can mean loosing or winning a race. There is no penalty for restarting a race in Career mode that I've noticed which is nice until you learn a track. Some tracks have jumps, and blind corners. There is a difficulty setting which affects how much credits you win from a race. It is set to default on Intermediate, but even Easiest can be tricky depending on the track and car that you have. What is tricky about Easiest is that you lap slower cpu, and they can get in your way when taking some corners or on tight track sections. This is annoying if you are trying to do a perfect race without any damage. Controls, and rumble feature are very nicely set up, you can change them if the default setting isn't what you want. I play using a 360 Afterglow controller. Overall, first impressions say a lot. This is nicely done. I will update this review as i play it more and get indepth into other modes, and multiplayer.

												Little Racers is a great little racer that manages to capture the spirit of those early isometric arcade games. It has plenty of cars and tracks and will keep you going for a long time. Plus it has a good multiplayer mode and lots of daily challenges to complete.If there is one fault it is that progress can be slow, but having said that the championship mode has a collection of it's own challenges such as winning so many times in a certain car or a certain class. Completing these can make life so much easier :)			"

												I know I haven't played it very long; I'm not a racing person, and yet, still found the little time I spent in here fairly enjoyable for what it is. Very simple, very basic, offers an easy to pick up top down micro-machines like arcade racer. Visuals are.. good I suppose? It's not heavy on the graphics, music and SFX are quite.. mediocre too, but the handling is certainly enjoyable, a decent amount of cars, tracks... it's probably best suited for casual racers, kids, with some friends, or if you just want a cheap, simple racer to dive into just every so often.So yeah, not my thing, and not too deep, but still recommended cause it's simple, works, and the relatively cheap price tag, though personally i'd wait for a sale.

Fun little racing game- indeed. Back in the 90s- I was a huge fan of Top Down Racers such as Micro Machines, Ignition or Death Rallye. Since I picked up casual gaming again, I haven't found a single(!!!!) good Top Down Racer!!!!!I hate this ""modern"" games where you can shoot or add all kinds of Stuff on your car- hell, I just want to race a few minutes and have fun.Anyway, this game indeed is probably the best one I've found so far. It's quick, it's fun and the graphics are somewhat ok. You buy a car, race, earn money to get higher level cars, invest in tuning or repairs(automatically). And there are different weather conditions such as snow with extremely slippy roads, rain or night races.Things that annoy me though is the AI- I feel you don't really have to be ""good"" in terms of drifting, braking or looking for short turns. All your opponents will drive like it's a huge destruction derby. Please, even Ignition was better in 1997. Anyway, thumbs up for being the first good top down racing game for years!			"

												I grew up on Amiga racing games like Overdrive, All Terrain Racing, Micro Machines, Roadkill et al. (not to mention Lotus or Jaguar XJ220, which, however, have different pov). Then I switched to Linux, where there are no decent racing games. As such, I thoroughly enjoy Little Racers and can recommend it to any and all racing fans. New FPS's with all the bells and whistles are fine, ambitious and original indie games are worth playing, but one also needs a dose of pure, simple fun and Little Racers provide exactly that. And at a very decent price, too!			"

												The game mechanics are quite good but the game itself has too many design flaws, first and maybe most important, the carreer, you can't choose the track to run on, the race you've won and stuff like that, every time you want to race Tha game chooses for you 5 races in different car classes (if you have the right cars of course) and you choose within those races, you get points based on your final position and you climb a ranking of all the racers in the city, the problem here is that there's no real end (or final goal if you prefer) and you can make it to the first place in ranking within a few hours, then you can continue to race as you wish but I'll be likely that you'll be out of motivations to do so. Also the game is not rewarding at all neither for your driving skills neither for your victories. Too bad for those flaws, because the game plays quite well			"

												Little Racers STREET (LRS) is basically a modern spin on ""Sprint"" the arcade game where you race top-down or isometric various vehicles on tight courses with some realistic drifting around corners, jumps, bumps, and the almost obligatory ""nitro"". There is a full ""upgrade"" system and multiple classes of cars (you start with E, and with a few upgrades you'll be in D). There are some rudimentary customization such as vinyl patterns, different paint colors (primary and secondary), and quite a few models of vehicles to pick from. Try not to damage your car as damages needs to be repaired, but you probably won't go broke, but you won't advance much either. If you can find it for a very low price this game is a bit of fun (and it has trading cards!)			"

												Awesome fun for a racing game that uses the keyboard.  Really good to play with friends and have a laugh.  Big racing game fan here - handling characteristics are good and FWD, RWD and AWD cars are all in the game and I think they work nicely, making it an acrade game that still requires a certain skill and understanding to win, but can also be enjoyed lightly.  Note - knowing how fun this is AFTER I purchased for myself only I would recommend the 4 pack for its value and because of how fun it is with friends.			"

												£4? well for £4 you get an immense little racer. This is by no means a simple top-down game as you can change the camera angle to chase cam and that makes it more appealing to a broader section of race gamers. The cars are great and can all be uprated which just adds to the fun. I have spent far more on games that I have enjoyed far less than this.

												Very underrated racing game! For a low price you get a nice experience that reminds me a bit of old Need For Speed games (mostly Underground), once you change the camera view from isometric to following the car. You can race in 5 car classes (the higher you get, the bigger the challenge), on numerous tracks utilising same city maps (much like NFS MW), earning money to buy or upgrade cars. It feels very satisfying!			"

												This game is simple racing fun. There's plenty to unlock, a good variety of tracks, difficulty levels (represented by vehicle/course grades) to challenge yourself, lots of achievements to work through if those are your thing, a fun soundtrack, and it's just a nice way to kill a few minutes here and there. The races are fairly short: usually three minutes or so, making it a perfect game to play in bite-sized portions.Graphics are shiny and serviceable. The vehicle handling varies enough from car to car that adjusting to the characteristics of a new car takes a little time, adding a bit of challenge. Cars don't deform in any way, which is probably good since everyone is slamming into each other (and the walls) constantly. They do take damage, though, and repairs are deducted from your winnings. Curiously, repair costs seem to be deliberately limited such that they never consume your winnings from a particular race, so you'll never end up in a situation where you have a broken car and no money to fix it.This is a great game for people who like the occasional bit of racing, rather than hardcore digital motorheads (which I am not.)

												Milkstone Studios has taken a bit of a step back into the past with its game Little Racers STREET. You don’t see too many of this type of game anymore. Does Little Racers STREET hit that nostalgic sweet-spot, or should Mikstone Studios be more focused on current gaming trends?Having grown up on isometric racers like R.C. Pro Am and Rock N’ Roll Racing, this was truly a blast from the past. The cars are so small that it also brought back memories of Micro Machines. This game did give me the opportunity to relive some of my fond memories from childhood.30 Second Review+ 41 different and uniquely customized vehicles.+ The Daily Challenge is a true challenge, because every player is on a level playing field with the same car.+ There is no difference between playing with a controller or using keyboard & mouse.- Will play differently compared to other racing titles you may have played previously in this genre.- Small online community.Click the link below to read the full review.http://everydaygamers.com/2014/04/05/review-little-racers-street/#more-29413 "

												It's by no means a bad game, but to be perfectly honest, you'll have more fun playing ""racing gears advance""for the gameboy advance.  Seriously.  I put so many hours into that game.  How is it better than this?  One word.  FUN!There's always grinding in games like this but you really feel it with LRS.  The random nature of the tracks makes you feel like you're getting nowhere, simply racing again and again to tick off the achievements to appease the game.  But I just didn't find it fun, it feels like grinding through a flash game.  In racing gears advance, you play as interesting characters, progress through leagues, earn and purchase upgrades, customize your car, and basically all these features are better implemented than in LRS.  And it's really fun!  Sure it's dated, but I pick it up now and still have more fun with it than LRS.  Before you buy this try racing gears advance.  I play it with my phone clipped to a sixaxis controller and it's fantastic. "

												I usually ragequit from driving/racing games. I often do that fast. This game didn't make me quit. I found it fair (unless you change to unfair mode :P) - and that's why I liked it. There are 5 difficulty levels and you can always choose the one that suits you best. LR Street doesn't stand out from the crowd, but it's solid in every regard. Graphics and music are simple, but they don't deter. Menus are simple, and even though they are simple and easy to navigate and read I didn't like them. I had impression that this part of the game was just rush and never finished, but that's my only complain. There is a basic selection of sound and graphical options, but you don't need more. Keys customization as well as joypad support are good. Game controls nice with both peripherals.Driving mechanics... well, it's present and I just learned it to beat AI in career. Just learn and you should not have problems winning the races. Speaking of modes there are a few of them: career,  time trial/lap record , daily challenge, multiplayer and freeroam. Nice, that's quite rich. AI/Bots - their difficulty ramps up as you change car classes - they are easiest in E class and of course much more difficult in A class. Car customization is present and is decent. You can improve your car's performance (better nitro, brakes, control etc etc), you can choose patterns and paint too. You don't have freedom in this regard, but what game offers is enough. As you change classes you can buy better cars. Every class has a few specific cars you can buy/improve and use for races. Track selection is decent - you won't be owerwhelmed, but you won't have to drive 5 same tracks till you throw up. There are 5 types of camera setting in this game. It's great, as you can choose the best or simply the one you like most.AI/Bots are good. It is possible to change their number between 1 and 11. They can annoy you at times, but this was the first game I didn't want to bash developer for unfair AI opponents. They get better and they will win, but I never found them unfair. It was always my fault (bad turn, too much speed, bad control over the car). They may block and ram you at time, but again - it was never aggravating as it is other games of this genre.I was happy with a Ghost Car feature. You can set a certain number of those to use in time trial/lap record races. They will not collide with you, but they will pose a challenge and help you beat records.You are probably wondering ""So much text, so little substance? Why are you recommending this game?"". Yeah, it's my fault that I can't pass my enjoyment with this game on you. I would like to, but it's also partially game's fault - it's solid. Nothing less, nothing more. As I said it doesn't stand out, but what it does, it does fun enough for me (a driving games hater) to tell you that I had a blast. I even did 100% achievos and in-game challenges. It was that fun. Buy it. It's a solid indie racing game.			"

												Definitely not as good as it is made out to be. So many design mistakes. First off, the game is super grindy and you do the same thing over and over again. The career involves you being ranked 300 and you have to just play races and your number randomly goes down without any rhyme or reason. After having played like 5 hours I was only at 200, which makes the grind feel even worse that it takes so long. The other few problems include cost of car, which ""A"" cars costing 3.5 million, and I was only at 1 million after 5 hours, so dumb. Only inflated prices to encourage grind. Another huge problem is inconsistent difficulty. I would be playing at a difficulty level and I would easily win one race, then I would actually upgrade my ride and the same cars in my class would somehow get ridiculously better. The next race with my even better car I would have trouble getting 4th. It made no sense and was stupid, this wipes out any feeling of progression and defies any actual logic. Also no split screen or local co-op, derpy decision. The other biggest problem with the game is Damage. Although getting damaged doesn't affect you much in races, it ruins any sense of progression. I would race ""A"" class races and having only damaged my car 25% I would have to spend (no exaggeration) 130k out of my 170k for repairs. To quote apparently kid,""apparenntlllyyyy, this game was made by idiots"". Why would you need to spendabout 2/3 your winnings to repair car. This makes getting upgrades and new cars ridiculously slow even at the top level races. Soo stupid, especially since it doesn't affect performance. And making it so high for getting such low damage. Most of you would say just dont get damaged, but once again this is another flaw. The computers that don't need to worry about paying bills fly around the map and have no problem hitting walls or each other. And since even on medium you can struggle to get top 5 if you have upgraded your car, you can't sit around going slowly. This means you have to bump and play by compy's rules, which ends up making you money. Absolutely idiotic design. Playing on easy also nets you less money, as if you makers want to punish you for their poor game design. Baffling design choices that are completely unnecessary ruin  the game. 100% better other micro racers out there on steam. 4/10			"

												Fun little racing game. Not real advanced but certainly enjoyable as a quick pick up and play game. I am not sure why the complains of camera view. Game offers different camera angles instead of just the top down micro machine racing view. You can have camera chase from a far or even camera chase directly behind the vehicle in most racing games these days. Only issue that could be fixed for the default camera sky view is on maps with tall builds on corners you can lose sight of your car for a second or two. Should be changed to a X-ray view through the buildings when that happens. Overall enjoyable game			"

												In this newest Need for Speed title, EA decided to take a bit of an oldschool approach and return the series to it's roots - Hot wheels with broken tires. I played this for four minutes, and to be truthful, i'm not worthy of getting the privilege to play anymore. B R A V O  E. A.			"

												I can't recommend this game. I only played the campaign. It's a fun little game that should've been a mobile game. The models and textures would be alright on the mobile platform but not on pc. The music is alright although becomes a bit repetative. Speaking of which the voiceover can become a bit annoying when you race on a small track and you keep getting a faster track time. When a race begins you just get burried with cars in the first corner. As long as you stay out of that heap of cars you will win the race. But getting stuck or hovering in the air, while the rest just drives off is really frustrating. The minimap and speed dail are unnessesary since you don't have the time to look at them. Plus the car gets covered with them so, you'll lose track it. Not being able to see your car is the worst part I think. There are a few ramps/bumps on which you can get some air. Being a top down racer you have no idea when this is happening. The car just becomes a bit bigger and the controls don't work for a while. That's considered a jump. But that is just the problem with this top down sort of racers. When the game starts up the screen just freezes for a while trying to load the video(?) that is used as a background. And when you get acchievements the game begins to stutter. For a casual game this might be enough but next to all those other racing games you might want to skip this one.			"

												Meh, boring grindy game.Playing it isn't that bad, but after a little short while, you'll come to think, ""why am I playing this?""""If I want to play a racing game, I'll play one with quality, this isn't one with quality.""It really isn't, however, it is cheap through a bundle.I wouldn't dare spend $8 for it just to come to the conclusion up above. I know I could get a better racing game through a bundle for near this price.The challenges are too much of a grind and you'll be thinking, ""why am I doing this?""To be fair, if you do not care too much about quality, this game could be for you to pass some time up, especially if you really have bad games at your disposal.The multiplayer is nonexistant, at least, it was for me.

												I can't possibly recommend it. I buy my first car which upgrades from E class to D class (from increasing a few stats with my remaining starting credits)...Then when the first race starts, the CPUs are about 1.7 times faster than me normally or with nitro boosts. I can go at max speed of 75 km/h while they move continuously at 130 km/h.its frustratingly unfair and unplayable... especially because of the nonstop tire sound you get when driving. I have no complaint about the somewhat soothing music though.If I stood a chance against the CPU I might have even recommended it.			"

												Ok here is my BIG review of this little gem of a game. I recently bought both version one on another name brand site . I had to find out if they added anything different to this version and boy did they.The original version  has less cars in it. The barriers in this game are animated in the old version is was just a red smoke like stuff. The graphics look more detailed and a lot more reflective surface on it then the old version. The maps look a lot better with better looking textures and the cars look a little bit better but not much different. The city at night looks a lot better then the old version they made a while back. This game has steam cards in it and now daily challenges against other drivers. The newer game is just better overall and the designers are very active on the forum.This is the version to get, it may cost a little more then the older versions but this one is so much better in a lot of different ways. I am very impressed by this game. The only weak spot may be the mulitplayer as only 40 or so people play online currently however the single player is so great I may never get online. Also it should be pointed out that only a max of 12 can play at any given time so 40 or so would not be a bad number. The camera view I use is rotating and it works perfect, another plus the game has a lot of different camera angles.  The difficulty level is perfect for me as I win a lot and sometimes  lose a race or two however even coming in 4th pays something and your not penalized much for not coming in 1st every time like some games that force you to place in the top 3 to advance. I also like that anyone can pick up and play this right away and wont have a tough time getting the controls down. I honestly cant think of to many cons for this game honestly. Also the races can be long or short depending on the number of laps. I suppose the only negative maybe that it take place in only 2 cities however that doesnt bug me at all. The city looks great and has a lot of character to it. Water effects, snow and rain all add to the charm of this great game. The game also has a night and day feature. Great game all around and if you love top down racers like Ignition, micro machines you will love this game.			"

												*DISCLAIMER: Add an hour to my play time before you judge this review based on game time. I spent an hour in the game when I first got it, and for some reason steam didn't track it*I really enjoy racing games, which is why I picked up Little Racers STREET. However, this game lacks any sort of depth or interesting tracks to make me want to come back for more. The game has a very cool concept, tiny cars racing. I'm sure its been done before, but it really wasn't done well here in my opinion. The sound assets leave something to be desired, and the enviornment around the tracks seems like it was made in minutes instead of hours. The game is also prone to situations where turning can either be extremely fun, or it can ruin a race for you do to horrible hit boxes on the edges of the street. Its ended up ruining a lot of races for meA lot of people claim the game has several different maps. While technically true, they are really just the same map redesigned over and over again. I'd say the game has 4 different maps, maybe a few more. A lot of tracks are just different variations of the same environment. Another big issue I have is the difficulty. Medium is extremely easy, I found myself beating every single race with little to no challenge. Hard is a decent challenge, and insane is really the mode you want to play on if you choose to pick this game up. I've yet to win a race on insane, its pretty difficult. But the other modes are just far to easy. This is a solid racing game, but it lacks any sort of depth at all. It is fairly cheep, so if you enjoy racing games it probably wouldn't hurt to pick this game up. But if you're like me, and your looking for great tracks, a great online community, and in depth racing, I'd look elsewere.Pros:-Up to 12 cars in a race-Decent career mode-CheapCons:-Poor car design-Weak race tracks-Uninspired evironments-Boring AI-Easy on low difficulty -Dead online community(Already)-Turning mechanics can ruin a race-Short Races			"

												Although the graphics are good, I am quite dissappointed with the quite unrealistic 'square corners' on about all the tracks. Those are just quite an annoyance. Just played the demo of Real World Racing, and although the graphics are lacking there, I do like the detail in car handling a bit better. The cars in this game now suddenly feel like they are just all about the same, and there is too little variation.			"

												This is a great game.  Buy it.  It's not a simulator, it's very arcade-sy but it has a great physics engine and is fun to play the whole time.  You keep getting better and better and then progressing through to more advanced classes where the cars are faster thus making it more challenging.  You buy cars, upgrade them, paint them, and fill up your ""garage"", but they have made it interesting by upping the class of a vehicle that has enough points.  This means there are only so many points you can allocate to a vehicle before it is in the higher class where it won't perform as well.  You end up buying a couple of the same car so you can have one focused on steering, another one focused at high speed, and so on, and maybe another one that has progressed to the higher class.  The way campaign races work is great, too.  You are presented with a bunch of available races from all of the available classes.  You might be all the way up to the 'B' or 'A' class cars, but there are still available 'E', 'D' and 'C' class races to do, so it lets you continue to use the older vehicles you have in the garage.  The new daily challenge thing is cool too, every day you get a race to do that is only available for that day, and everyone in the world is basically playing it to get the fastest lap, and whoever has the current fastest is the ghost that everyone chases while they play.  It shows you the world ranking too, it's awesome to know you how close you are to the best time.  Maybe one day the data from these race times will mean something.  It's sort of a new feature, it would be cool to have on your profile (# of daily challenges entered, # of 1st place, the dates, or something like that). One thing I would have to say is annoying is paying to repair your car later on (with in-game money, taken off the of the race winnings).  Initially you drive so slow that you rarely need to think about the repair cost but the 'B' and 'A' class cars are VERY fast.  The AI is also really good in these classes so you have to push it to the limit, and bumping into the sides causes your vehicle damage, more-so the faster you are going.  Also your vehicle starts to go slower because of the damage, causing a great disadvantage.  Sometimes 50% of the prize money from a race is going to repairs.  But meh, doesn't turn me off from playing!All in all, a solid buy.  Try get it on sale!			"

WARNING[Disclaimer]=> I've played only half an hour at the moment of writing this review, and probably will renew it when I will have something to add. And I am sorry for my english ^_^        First of all, I want to point out, that I played a game similar to this in my childhood. It was in SEGA. Idea of that game was just like in Little Racers Street (further on - LRS). And I really loved it! It was fun playing with my friends and beating them. That experience has triggered me to try this game out.        I bought LRS on a sale, but yet think I really overpayed for it. Yes, this game looks pretty good, it doesn't need great graphics. But physics are awful!!! Just...terrible!!!  In my own opinion, of course You don't have to put a lot of effort to do a drift. In fact you don't have to put ANY...Car drifts anytime you press left < and right > buttons, and it really annoys. I can't understand what for do I need break/back and handbreak (left Alt) buttons. When you press break/back button, car almost stops, so there is no point to use handbreak! You don't even have to release ""forward"" button. If you do it, you will loose your speed very quickly. You ONLY have to turn right/left in time. And this ""turning"" is really bad.        I am so dissapointed with this game, which I hoped would remind me of my childhood.  Parametr Description Pts/10   Graphics not really stunning, though it's not the main thing in game 5   Gameplay have different options: free roam, career mode, multiplayer, fast race, time race and different types of cars 7   Physics big minus of the game...terrible physics 1   Soundtrack is not special (just short beat that repeats), annoys after some time 4   Other sounds in general sounds are ok. But when you here ""Final Lap, Fastest Lap"". That's crap. Feels like game developer recorded them himself 2   Cost WTF? 5.99$ is a robbery. No, seriously, this game should cost 0.99$ max, better be free -1   Extra at least you can choose camera view in settings    "

Now i can play  but the game thinks i have my brakes turned on the whole time (i checked for stuck keys, nothing is wrong). I quit and tried to reload and play again and now the performance is so bad it is un playable, getting about 2 or 3 fps.

												Take 'World Rally Championship' from the arcade (c.1993), remove the time clock, checkpoints, jumps and obstacles, toss in unimaginative leader ladder, psychadelic colours, shoddy environmental physics and chaotic driver 'ai' along side questionable camera options and you have this messy concept of a racing game that lacks depth.PS.

												What the hell is this junk???I understand the concept but the implementation OMFG!For some reason the cars can't even be controlled properly. The car move by themselves. Even when you're stopped the car can be turned left or right, DEV are you familiar with the concept of physics? The camera position is close to terrible.I do not recommend this piece of junk. DO NOT BUY, THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FAKE!			"

												At first glance, Little Racers doesn't look like much fun.  Personally, I was never a huge fan of the top down racing games.  But after trying this out, I found that it can be pretty fun.  Every car controls in it's own unique way and on top of that there are so many cars to choose from and customize to play the way you want to.  On top of that, the game is quite addicting!  I've found myself hopping on to run the daily challenges and then challenging my friends to beat my lap times.  This is a fun experience, don't let the simple graphics fool you!			"

												100% Completion ReviewEvil Blue Walls Of Death!Im not a real fan of racing games, but once I picked this game up I was immediately hooked. I think it was due to the casual simplistic nature of the that made it fun, you could pick it up for 30mins then just leave it for another time. There is a great collection of cars and a nice tier system for the game, the challanges can make it even more fun and keeps things interesting.After a while it is a bit of a grind to 100% the game (to get all cars) but it was fun while it lasted. Sadly online is dead so I never really got a chance to play that, that being said this came would be even more fun with friends. A decent purchase for any casual racer.			"

												There are a fair number of games in the genre Little Racers STREET belong to, but so far, I have not found one that plays better. A couple of the competitors may look prettier, but the thing that really sets LRS apart is that the control is ""just right"" and the camera work feels tight in all the camera modes I've tried. All of this this translates into a game that is fun and satisfying to play, and one where if you lose, it is, for the most part, your fault.Oh, and the comment above about competitors being prettier is not really a backhanded way of slamming LRS for being ugly, because it's not. In fact, it's even got a little ""art style""-thing going. Even setting that aside, it's looks are functional, and add to the feeling of racing toy cars which is sort of what the whole genre is all about, rather than being a driving simulation.			"

												I used to love the top down racers years ago, think there was a game called Supercars for the Commodore Amiga, anyway this is a nice trip back to the good old days where 3D had to be rendered in 2D.  It's fun, is actually surprisingly challenging, the graphics are ok, the gameplay is ok, it's not a big budget game, but it's quite enjoyable :)There's no doubt that this is the first of many games that are likely to appear in this genre. Worth £1.99 in the Steam sale even if you just play it a few times, easy to unlock some achievements too :)			"

												The game is actually broken, but people assume that no one is playing and that's why they're not finding any games.In reality, you upgrade your car to a new class, host a game, and no one in your same class, nor last class, can join you.As well there's another bug where if you try and host or join games without a car already set, it will take you to a pick car screen but stick you there, un able to pick a car you don't have, and at the same time won't let you back out, that's right the back up button will make a noise, but refuse to actually back out.Besides this, the game is simple enough, sometimes a little too simple, but could be fun with friends. You will have a lil fun with friends , even with just a little upgrade, but the moment your friends upgrade the car to a level it classes up, you strangely can't ever host a game they can join ever again.The game as said is broken. It's technicaly multi player, but in the state of it's testing as of moments before this typing, that multi player is very fractured due to glitches to go with the other glitches. Being that I got the game on sale on top of it's already low price I won't bother getting the refund, and if you're willing to toss the eight bucks, it's still a one player experience more or less. But being that this game is back from 2014 and feeling like it's early access, I can't expect to to be fixed.In short, multi player works till you class up, then it seems broken as of this typing. Buyer beware.			"

												Little Racer STREET is a very good game. It looks like NITRO on AMIGA, but in smooth 3D of course. Gameplay, graphics, SFX and musics, are really nice. There is a lot of tracks and cars. There is 5 category (A, B, C, D AND E). E and D categories are quite easy even if you have to choose adequate cars to achieve category D. Later, as you reach the C category, it is another story. It is fast, so fast and enjoyable.You will have to train a lot, loose a lot of races before beating the game. But it is not a big deal because you will unlock a lot a steam achievements (40+) that will give you money. Try to recognize cars that always beat you and buy these cars. After you will tune these cars and win. I have played straight 8 hours with this game this afternoon, and never got bored. Buy it if you want fun, it worths the money.			"

												STORYNone (It's probably better to have none than to make a shoddy plot that has nothing to do with the game) VISUAL+ You can have a follow behind the car camera like a traditional racer or have a birdseye isomentric camera viewing all action like a toy racer. This is the only racing game I've ever seen done this and provides a different experience in how you look at the game.+ Clean 80's Tron-like inspired graphics let you know everything is without needing any menu of any in game menu kind.+ Weather effects although it's nothing more than simple effects it's gives variation to gameplay+/- No shadows or reflections... I guess this can also be a plus as it will literally run on any old machine.- Bland models of cars and backgrounds don't really provide any visual appeal to the one city you're playing in.- Feels like contant night always.SOUND- Forgetable music which I'd rather put on silent and play my own music- Bland FX and commentatorGAMEPLAY+ Very responsive, tight, customizable controls+ No problem with mulitplayer if you ever get to play anyone+ Does provide some challenge with those really annoyingling competitive AI- Cars feel very light and damage is unavoidable which affects the winnings you get after completion.- Can be called ""Bumper Car Simulator"" as you'll get annoyed at the AI ramming into youOVERALL 5/10It's pretty much a minimal racer with minimal upgrades, and does do what it does well with less than inspiring visuals and audio. Good if you don't mind a simple racer with none of the clutter and getting with a major discount.			"

												-This is a pure old school racing game, cars react like you'd expect, it's got that underground street racing feel with a techno soundtrack that fits the game.-There are plenty of circuits and between a few dozens of cars with upgrades, a carreer mode, time trials, and multiplayer there's a lot of content here. -There are also a few camera views, so if you don't like the standard top down view you can even race with a close view akin to most racers. The cherry on the top is the ridiculous price of this game. So this is that kind of game, just by looking at the screenshots, you should have already made up your mind.What you see here is what you're gonna get.

												I will try almost any game with Steam Cloud and Steam Achievements. Full Controller Support is basically mandatory for racing games in my book Trading Cards are a nice bonus if you like those. I really like games that integrate themselves to Steam and this one does.On top of that, I love racing games and arcade style racing games are my favorite of those.This isn't the best one ever made, but it ticks enough boxes that I'll recommend it.The Good:Races only take a couple of minutes, but are longer at the higher levels. There must be hundreds of different levels, all similar, but with very different routes, which makes for a lot of replayability.This game, unlike many of these top down racers, actually has multiple camera options, one of which is a behind the car 3rd person view which makes the game much more intense. I play this angle most of all, as it is quite like the normal view in many traditional racing games.The game is extremely fast paced at the higher levels and quite difficult. You will need lightning fast reflexes to make it through the 90 degree turns that come one after another after another after another in some instances.The Bad:The controls are very twitchy and not exactly smooth. You turn in slight increments, which is strange considering this game seems to have a full 3d physics engine behind it. I don't know if this is because I'm playing with a controller or not, but I doubt it.There is very little artistic variety. There is very little variety, frankly, of any kind, except for with the route of the tracks and the visual style of the cars. This is a game of repition on a theme and gameplay that you had better enjoy to want to play very much of.			"

												This is a fun little game. It's something I've been looking for for quite some time - a fun little racing game like the old Micro Machines games.I was hoping for a slightly more complex career mode. In this career mode, you get the option of 5 random tracks at a time and after beating a race you get 5 different random track options. There's no working towards beating a specific track - even if you end up last in a race, you just get 5 different random tracks afterwards.Each race awards some cash which you can use on new cars and upgrades for them.A lot of in-game and steam achievements tickle your brain's reward center even if you only start the game to do 2 or 3 quick races.Having 5 different difficulty settings enables even casuals without any skill or impulse to improve - like me - to enjoy the game.All in all there's no real depth, but it's perfect for killing some time for 10-20 minutes here and there. I got it among 7-9 other games in a bundle for ~2.50€. All things considered, I got much more value out of this than most of the more expensive games in my library. Heck, It'd be worth the 6 bucks to me even outside of a sale or bundle.			"

												A very fun racing game. I'd compare it to a really really simplified Grand Turismo. You buy a car of a lower class and work your way up to cars of a higher class. You can upgrade your cars (also simplified and not in depth at all) and it still maintains that fun factor. The best part about this game is that you can race against others online.I wouldn't pay the 7.99 it takes to buy this game but if you can get it for $3 or less it's worth it. The cars aren't licensed but they do make them appear like the actual models (viper is black mamba and looks close enough).You can get this game cheap on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or Steampowers which is where I bought mine and is well worth it because it also comes with trading cards, a lot actually.

												I played this game enough to complete absolutely everything, so I can't claim I didn't get my money's worth, but honestly it's not a very good game.  It starts off well enough: the early classes are fairly fun, the game moves at a decent clip while remaining decently controllable and the races are short and varied.  However, once you advance through the classes the game's issues start to become apparent.  First of all, there isn't a lot of variety to the game's tracks, and by your hundredth race or so, you quickly start to feel like you've seen it all, a problem which is compounded by the fact that the later classes have unreasonably many laps per race.  There's simply nothing interesting about racing around a course for more than 3 laps, which is particularly compounded by the fact that every race is decided in lap 1.  You see, by far this game's worst problem is its idiotic car damage system.  Every time you touch a wall or another car, even if it's just the lightest of taps, you take damage, which reduces your top speed.  There is no way to repair damage during the race, and if you take enough damage you simply cannot win because you won't be able to pass your rivals.  This is particularly vital in the higher speed classes as these cars are hard to control and are very fragile, extremely careful and meticulous driving is the only way to go with these flimsy rides.  This turns this game into a frontrunner's dream, the first place racer can drive carefully and safely navigate the course while taking little damage, while the racers behind have to be more aggressive to try to regain ground, but in so doing they damage their cars to the point where they cannot possibly catch up to the relatively unscathed first place driver.  Almost every race on A class either ends up in humilating defeat or with you lapping the other cars several times over, close races are virtually nonexistant thanks to this mechanic.  As if this wasn't bad enough, your prize money after each race is garnished to repair your damage, and in the A class cars, even if you have almost no damage it will always take 80% (the maximum amount) since these cars are so expensive, meaning that A class is terrible for making money and thus the pricey final cars take FOREVER to earn.There are further problems, too, like bad car balance (Grip and Power are the only stats that matter, never increase the others), and some challenges taking way too long to unlock (though this is really one of the only good points of the game), but this is really just more water under the bridge at this point.Overall, this is a game that had some potential but was hampered by poor design decisions.  It can be a bit of fun in short bursts but the problems quickly become apparent the longer you play.  The developer also seems to have abandonned this game as it has not recieved any updates in a long time, so I wouldn't expect any new content or anything like that.  If you want a top down racer there are many better ones available.			"

												This game is a perfect example of less being more and simple being better. All of us which are perhaps a bit older were waiting for a retro-ish top down racing game which would bring some degree of nostalgia back to life. Games like Skidmarks or Super Cars are the closest resembles, or a bit newer Gene Rally. Everyone who enjoyed those games will enjoy LRS.It has a great playability, where career mode is not even the main fun here (probably cause the main goal isn't really that challenging). Playing with friends, or against time brings the best from this game.But there are a few aspects to this game, which could be better. The main thing which bothers me is a map/city layout, where you drive basically on just two huge maps, where every track has different paths. Problem here is you hardly memorize all those directions and the barrier closing road directions aren't always that visible, especially when you're concentrating your eyes on your car when you're fighting against sharp corners on the road and overlook the barrier cause the road would run smoothly through it, but instead the track goes to some other direction on the junctions.With all those crossroads it is sometimes very confusing where to drive, especially cause on higher level cars the speed is brutal and the crashes are many.I know for the developers that kind of layout was a bit easier way to deal with choice of numerical tracks, but cause of this, the game lacks of diversity. This is why I also miss track editor and a choice to make a classic tracks without redundant closed streets confusing the player.That being said, game IS great, as I said at the beginning. The choice with cameras is absolutely fantastic, lots of different perspectives to choose from and all of them bring additional dynamic and ways to play the game. Some views are perhaps harder to master cause you don't see as much in front of you, but have their own charm nevertheless.Cars are realistic as it gets. Lots to choose from, lots of micro-managing and tuning of the cars with different drive behaviours.So yeah, I recommend it, a lot!			"

												Fun little racing game. Sure, it doesn't look as amazing as Gran Turismo, but it also doesn't play realistic either. Most of the camera angles are from high up, so if feels more like RC Pro AM or something like that. It might feel slow at first, but once you buy your second car, it should start feeling faster from there. If you are into unrealistic racing and you see this on sale, pick it up.			"

												Yes, this is based of some classics but it's not Micro-Machines as much as it's other games. No, this little gem is more similar to:Super Off-RoadRC Prom-AmRock n' Roll RacingDrift ManiaDanny Sullivan's Indy HeatSuper SkidmarksAnd the list can go on.  The only caveat is that this game isn't as polished and refined as those titles. It's pretty darn good, for an indie title, and therein lies the rub. If you view this as an arcade street racing version of Super Off-Road you'll likely not be disappointed but I feel there were a few missed opportunities here and quite a few glitches/bugs/design choices that keep this title from being a cult classic.Still, it's an indie game priced at $8 and has been bundled quite a few times. I think you DEFINITELY get what you pay for and hopefully these devs come back with a more refined, and more expensive, game in the future. The potential is definitely there.			"

												Fun little racing game. Sure, it doesn't look as amazing as Gran Turismo, but it also doesn't play realistic either. Most of the camera angles are from high up, so if feels more like RC Pro AM or something like that. It might feel slow at first, but once you buy your second car, it should start feeling faster from there. If you are into unrealistic racing and you see this on sale, pick it up.			"

												This game is a perfect example of less being more and simple being better. All of us which are perhaps a bit older were waiting for a retro-ish top down racing game which would bring some degree of nostalgia back to life. Games like Skidmarks or Super Cars are the closest resembles, or a bit newer Gene Rally. Everyone who enjoyed those games will enjoy LRS.It has a great playability, where career mode is not even the main fun here (probably cause the main goal isn't really that challenging). Playing with friends, or against time brings the best from this game.But there are a few aspects to this game, which could be better. The main thing which bothers me is a map/city layout, where you drive basically on just two huge maps, where every track has different paths. Problem here is you hardly memorize all those directions and the barrier closing road directions aren't always that visible, especially when you're concentrating your eyes on your car when you're fighting against sharp corners on the road and overlook the barrier cause the road would run smoothly through it, but instead the track goes to some other direction on the junctions.With all those crossroads it is sometimes very confusing where to drive, especially cause on higher level cars the speed is brutal and the crashes are many.I know for the developers that kind of layout was a bit easier way to deal with choice of numerical tracks, but cause of this, the game lacks of diversity. This is why I also miss track editor and a choice to make a classic tracks without redundant closed streets confusing the player.That being said, game IS great, as I said at the beginning. The choice with cameras is absolutely fantastic, lots of different perspectives to choose from and all of them bring additional dynamic and ways to play the game. Some views are perhaps harder to master cause you don't see as much in front of you, but have their own charm nevertheless.Cars are realistic as it gets. Lots to choose from, lots of micro-managing and tuning of the cars with different drive behaviours.So yeah, I recommend it, a lot!			"

												A fun little game. I enjoy blasting round a few tracks.The tracks often have bits jutting out which will stop you dead if you hit them, and this may frustrate more casual players. You'll need to get to a reasonable standard to win regularly as the cars get faster.It isn't perfect. The textures leave a lot to be desired, as do some of the crash physics - which are an unsatisfactory middle ground between realistic and cartoony. It does not remember your camera settings and the default camera is unusable in the faster classes.			"

												Do you have fond memories of playing Micro Machines on the NES? Do you enjoy a good arcade racing title from time to time? If you answered ""yes"" to either fo those questions, then Little Racers Street is well-worth strapping into for a ride. The game is fast-paced, looks great and has a surprisingly captivating soundtrack that does a fantastic job of pumping the game into high gear. A multitude of challenges and a long list of tracks keeps things fresh long after the initial checkered flag is crossed. With the cheap asking price - it's hard not to recommend Little Racers Street to any fan that likes to put a little burned rubber on the road.			"

												Definitively not your average racing game. This game is awesome. If you like the racing mechanics in Need for Speed Underground II, this game is a light version of it. Easy controls and cool mechanics. A casual racing game to spend some loose hours.The cons I found so far are lack of custumization for your cars. Yo can have 2 colors (basic and overlays) and somewhat like 20 different overlay styles. 5 levels of upgrading (from motor power, to grip, to turning and nitro)Races are pretty quick so it makes this game a pretty cool quick match gameA good amount of cars and racesI love the game, probably devs should look at some expansion stuff for cars, more custum options, probably new tracks (the map is somewhat big in different areas but you see it all in like 30 min of playing)			"

												I played this game enough to complete absolutely everything, so I can't claim I didn't get my money's worth, but honestly it's not a very good game.  It starts off well enough: the early classes are fairly fun, the game moves at a decent clip while remaining decently controllable and the races are short and varied.  However, once you advance through the classes the game's issues start to become apparent.  First of all, there isn't a lot of variety to the game's tracks, and by your hundredth race or so, you quickly start to feel like you've seen it all, a problem which is compounded by the fact that the later classes have unreasonably many laps per race.  There's simply nothing interesting about racing around a course for more than 3 laps, which is particularly compounded by the fact that every race is decided in lap 1.  You see, by far this game's worst problem is its idiotic car damage system.  Every time you touch a wall or another car, even if it's just the lightest of taps, you take damage, which reduces your top speed.  There is no way to repair damage during the race, and if you take enough damage you simply cannot win because you won't be able to pass your rivals.  This is particularly vital in the higher speed classes as these cars are hard to control and are very fragile, extremely careful and meticulous driving is the only way to go with these flimsy rides.  This turns this game into a frontrunner's dream, the first place racer can drive carefully and safely navigate the course while taking little damage, while the racers behind have to be more aggressive to try to regain ground, but in so doing they damage their cars to the point where they cannot possibly catch up to the relatively unscathed first place driver.  Almost every race on A class either ends up in humilating defeat or with you lapping the other cars several times over, close races are virtually nonexistant thanks to this mechanic.  As if this wasn't bad enough, your prize money after each race is garnished to repair your damage, and in the A class cars, even if you have almost no damage it will always take 80% (the maximum amount) since these cars are so expensive, meaning that A class is terrible for making money and thus the pricey final cars take FOREVER to earn.There are further problems, too, like bad car balance (Grip and Power are the only stats that matter, never increase the others), and some challenges taking way too long to unlock (though this is really one of the only good points of the game), but this is really just more water under the bridge at this point.Overall, this is a game that had some potential but was hampered by poor design decisions.  It can be a bit of fun in short bursts but the problems quickly become apparent the longer you play.  The developer also seems to have abandonned this game as it has not recieved any updates in a long time, so I wouldn't expect any new content or anything like that.  If you want a top down racer there are many better ones available.			"

												This is a fun little game. It's something I've been looking for for quite some time - a fun little racing game like the old Micro Machines games.I was hoping for a slightly more complex career mode. In this career mode, you get the option of 5 random tracks at a time and after beating a race you get 5 different random track options. There's no working towards beating a specific track - even if you end up last in a race, you just get 5 different random tracks afterwards.Each race awards some cash which you can use on new cars and upgrades for them.A lot of in-game and steam achievements tickle your brain's reward center even if you only start the game to do 2 or 3 quick races.Having 5 different difficulty settings enables even casuals without any skill or impulse to improve - like me - to enjoy the game.All in all there's no real depth, but it's perfect for killing some time for 10-20 minutes here and there. I got it among 7-9 other games in a bundle for ~2.50€. All things considered, I got much more value out of this than most of the more expensive games in my library. Heck, It'd be worth the 6 bucks to me even outside of a sale or bundle.			"

												A very fun racing game. I'd compare it to a really really simplified Grand Turismo. You buy a car of a lower class and work your way up to cars of a higher class. You can upgrade your cars (also simplified and not in depth at all) and it still maintains that fun factor. The best part about this game is that you can race against others online.I wouldn't pay the 7.99 it takes to buy this game but if you can get it for $3 or less it's worth it. The cars aren't licensed but they do make them appear like the actual models (viper is black mamba and looks close enough).You can get this game cheap on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or Steampowers which is where I bought mine and is well worth it because it also comes with trading cards, a lot actually.

There is 5 category (A, B, C, D AND E). E and D categories are quite easy even if you have to choose adequate cars to achieve category D. Later, as you reach the C category, it is another story. It is fast, so fast and enjoyable.You will have to train a lot, loose a lot of races before beating the game. But it is not a big deal because you will unlock a lot a steam achievements (40+) that will give you money. Try to recognize cars that always beat you and buy these cars.

												I love this game and its really fun, but my Knight 2000 keeps locking up on turns, costing me the race. I don't see this happening to class C cars racing against me, and when it happens on more crowded races all the cars behind me start barreling into me, causing a huge pileup while the cars in front just keep going. Other than this(and the fact that class C and up repairs are rediculous), the game is great. It runs perfectly on Mac, but really you shouldn't play it with the keyboard because normal gaming controllers, like the Logitech Dual-Action, have thumbsticks and triggers, which are kind of like having steering wheels and pedals i guess. Free Roam is also great because you can test drive your new cars, practice turns and get to know the maps so you know what to expect in different races. It has good graphics and good racing music. I also like that you can upgrade your cars, because it lets you improve on the less strong bits of your cars. Little Racers STREET is a good game, and i do recomend it to anyone who likes cars, racing, and competitive multiplayer.			"

I think you DEFINITELY get what you pay for and hopefully these devs come back with a more refined, and more expensive, game in the future. The potential is definitely there.			"

												A very fun racing game. I'd compare it to a really really simplified Grand Turismo. You buy a car of a lower class and work your way up to cars of a higher class. You can upgrade your cars (also simplified and not in depth at all) and it still maintains that fun factor. The best part about this game is that you can race against others online.I wouldn't pay the 7.99 it takes to buy this game but if you can get it for $3 or less it's worth it. The cars aren't licensed but they do make them appear like the actual models (viper is black mamba and looks close enough).You can get this game cheap on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or Steampowers which is where I bought mine and is well worth it because it also comes with trading cards, a lot actually.

												If you miss Micro Machines, this is a competent, budget alternative that will easily kill a few hours or more. AI gets a little ridiculous at the higher tiers, but harmless fun none-the-less.			"

												Little Racer STREET is a indie GEM. It has all the tracks, cars and upgrade tactics you would usually see in a big release racing game.The controls are great and the gameplay quit addicitive. Specially with friends this game will keep you busy for while. No excuse not to buy this game. Highly recommended.I'd rate this 9 out of 10 points. (for what it is)			"

												I bought Little Racers Street ages ago. It's a great casual little game that is fun to play for half an hour or so at a go. I find myself coming back to it every six months or so when I feel like some quick and simple arcade fun.The premise is simple, you can buy cars, upgrade them, and race them in short races against a varying number of opponents. The races have different weather conditions that affect the handling of your car. The better you do in a race, the more money you win for buying new cars and/or upgrade your current cars. There's also different classes of cars, and upgrading a car can put it into a higher tier. That's pretty much it.The tracks are generally pretty similar, and take place on a number of shared maps with different routes for the different races. As the name says, you are racing on streets (i.e. not a for-purpose race track) and the courses tend to combine several straights and several sharp turns, with some tracks more winding than others.Car handling is decent and arcadey, as befits the genre, and you have a nitro that slowly recharges over time and is best used on the long straights. Your car also has a damage metre that rises as you crash into the environment or when you drop from a height, a feature on a few of the courses. The more damage you do to your car during the race, the more money is deducted from your earnings to repair your car.There's also online multiplayer, but I have never tried it, so I can't comment on that.I see a lot of references to old-school arcade racers, and Little Racers STREET is very much in the same vein. Personally it reminds me a lot of Supercars (sans weapons and with a different camera view) and Skidmarks (especially the semi-isometric perspective and car handling). At any rate, if you enjoy casual arcade racers, I say give this one a whirl. Just don't expect anything deep and revolutionary.			"

												Just to make it clear: I do NOT think this is a bad game, I just don't recommend it.At first this game might look like the average run-of-the-mill isometric indie crap racing game and yeah yeah rain snow funny visuals blah blah blah BUT! There's actually more to it.I'll keep the upsides short because you can't make too much wrong for your average top-down/isometric arcade racing game.Honestly I was surprised that rain and snow aren't merely visually there but really do have an impact on your cars behaviour. Controls overall surprisingly good. This also means you need to master the mechanics in order to have a chance against AI on default difficulty. There are several modes, more than enough track choices and cars (seperated into 5 classes E-A) to choose from. What I found especially fun were the different camera angles/modes, you should try them!The bad sides though are why I don't recommend it: no ""traditional rubberbanding""...I never got why people hate rubberbanding. After a game like this you'll love rubberbanding. Cars have different attributes and there are objective superior cars. When they're in front of you, you're basically screwed. Especially normal/higher difficulties, but even lower levels are not sure wins all the time (of course you'll easily win most, but there some infuratingly frustrating losses too). Difficulty only applies to AI acceleration. When you're starting to become good, become better, then you can try on harder modes.Getting all the achievements is a chore. There's a good reason minimum %Achievement is the full garage. Cash prizes are dim, car prices are HIGH. Other than that there was no long-term motivation for me. Unless you plan on getting the game to play it with/against friends this is a rather bland experience, but even if that's your idea keep in mind that you'll have to unlock cars the normal way, multiplayer doesn't have extra stuff unlocked.If, on the other hand, you intend to enjoy it alone, prepare to experience a quite basic but moderately challenging smooth arcade racer to take your mind off things.side note: might just have been my controller, but this game does NOT have ""full"" controller support, better check back in discussions to make sure yours will work			"

												i got this game for free in my inbox about a year ago, and i played it a fair amount. for what it is, what resources it looked like it was made with, it's pretty well done. the progression is a bit linear, the graphics are humble, and the title of the game is everything i despise about labels and keywords, but damned if the mechanics and level design aren't balanced for maximum flow. this ♥♥♥♥ is zen, yo.to the developers, i hope you continue to make strides and projects. i wish you the best and freest of opportunities. i don't know how i got ahold of this game - it must have been a free giveaway doled out by random number generation, but i'm glad i got it. i consider myself lucky for receiving it and the lessons it somehow managed to teach me. it was like siddhartha, by hesse - yeah yeah yeah, fancy ♥♥♥ literary references, but it came at a time when the lessons it had to offer me were sorely needed.it's taken a year for me to get around to writing this review, but that should say something about its effectiveness at being a game, at being something worth experiencing for the sake of experience. at least, it does for me. ♥♥♥♥'s zen, yo. good work.

												Looks very basic and the feature I bought it for - Multiplayer - does not seem to be supported in any way. They need to update the description. Wouldn't change my rating to recommended, but it would make me delete my rating (if I notice the change).			"

												Neat little top-down street racer. Fun to play, lot to enhance, paint or upgrade on pool of different cars. Races are seperated in different divisions. You could buy car for every division or enhance car till it reaches next one. Challenging the higher you go, while upgrades help to get better control over your racer.			"
