												I'm going to start by saying that this game is fun and I did not receive motion sickness while playing it.The motion controls are crap in the game though. They don't add anything to it except for horrible steering (which is done with the touchpad). They basically just use the motion controls as a controller and not for motion. They only have them in it so they can say they use motion controllers. You do not steer with the controllers, you use the track bad. For power ups and boost you also just press the touchpads. While the tracks are nice to look at, they are short and are basically just flat ground with nothing else. If you are looking for motion controlled mario kart then you are looking in the wrong place. Maybe with future updates they will make them better but I doubt it since this is not even a early release or alpha or beta.			"

												I'd love to actually play this game, but the current control system is broken.  I tried racing and my driver kept steering off in different directions even when not touching the Vive touchpad.  Conversely, it would sometimes stop steering even when using the touchpad.  There also doesn't appear to be any support for driving wheels, whereas the Rift version advertises that support.There is also no in-game representation of the Vive controllers even in the menu.  This makes it difficult to know exactly where on the track pad you are pressing, since you have no visual feedback, but they still divide the trackpad into multiple buttons.It's disappointing how something as basic as getting the controls wrong can break an otherwise promising looking game.Updated: I tried it with an Xbox 360 controller and that worked fine.  It was actually controllable.  However, the game did not specifically indicate it could use an Xbox controller; the custom controller setup also only seems to work with the Xbox controller but not the Vive controllers.			"

												I just picked up this game, and I feel bad for both the developer as well as the community, as the game is a really fun little racing game with a lot of (unjust) bad reviews. Now... don't get me wrong... I feel like they should add some real motion control steering, but I have been playing using my xbox 360 controller, and it's a blast. The graphics are cartoony and fun. The driving on the controller is smooth and very responsive. The view itself is great, with nearly zero interference from the cart itself. You can get a great view of everything happening around you. There are a wide variety of different weapons to use in the game... from tire spike strips to homing missiles. The game also runs really well. I have a GTX980 (not a ti), and it runs perfectly smoothly through the whole race. The graphics are also easy on the eyes, being that games with a lot going on often times end up looking rough and pixelated in VR. There's plenty to look at in the levels, but it's all pretty crisp (as crisp as VR can be). I certainly feel like they could improve some of the control features. Having boost and drift the same thing is kida silly, and I think it's way too easy to spin out when you're bumped. Still... for 15 bucks, you get a fun, great looking Mario Kart feel with great VR driving action. Adding true motion controls should clearly be at the top of their list, but for those who enjoy using a controller... you should be plenty happy with your purchase.			"

												I bought this and played it for 20 minutes. It works great with a xbox 360 controller and handles really well. It is the first game that i have asked for a refund of though. There are a few issuses with it. first off its just not fun. It has some great ideas but some of the weapons just ruin the race for the racer it feels unbalanced. One of the weapons turns your steering wheel to the left for to long. Its bad enough to crash into the wall because of getting hit with this weapon but it takes control of your kart for 10-15 seconds and after that everyone has passed you and i just couldnt be bothered trying after that.The scale also feels off the kart is huge and the world is huge. if everthing was %50 smaller I think it would be better. in a kart you don't sit on a chair you sit almost on the ground its a small and very compact feeling. Being low to the ground increases the sense of going fast.This feels like your sitting on a bar chair and your driving a buss.I think the tunnels should be lowered by %60 so you get that felling of incresed speed again by having your surroundings close to you and again the sense of speed picking up. athough you wouldnt be going any faster it would feel like you were.also the speed of the karts are slow. again if you were lower to the ground it would probably feel like the right speed.The menus and end of the race all work fantastically.I think if they were to give this more polish it would be great and i would be happy to buy it again. but for now its just not fun.

												This was my first experience with the Vive that did not use tracked controllers and I was dissapointed ( I was trying to avoid this for now but it seemed it supported it under the controller compatability).Also, the controls don't even work properly. Often times the steering just stops working and you run into a wall.			"

												The touch motion controllers are used, but not for motion, just the buttons. Game says ""Press A!"" expecting you to know what ""A"" should be. The biggest issue for me, though, is that after just a few seconds into the race, the trigger to accelerate stops working and I can only go backwards.			"

												Super intéressant ! BIen conçu pour la VR, le multiplayer est vraiment marrant (course 1 vs  1 pour le moment). Quand on pourra jouer à 8, le jeu deviendra un must have.Very good game, especially for multiplayer game. Must have when there will be enough players.Edit : no motion sickness at all for me. Windlands yes (2 days...) but this one, no problem.			"

												I love kart racing, just not this one. I have tried it now with both types of controls. Bleggh.Game is so slow, you dont even feel like you are moving much. Would love to get my 15 bucks back!I have over 50 games, experiences for the Vive.  This is my least favorite. Maybe they will fix this in future updates, but as of now, just not for me.			"

												I want to like this game, and I think I could if the controls get fixed. Right now using the motion controllers for buttons is seriously broken, to the point where the game is not playable. I am going to try using and xbox elite controller to see if it acts any better. I will update this review once I try. In it's current state, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												OK so I only played a few minutes and I can say this is a game finally designed with VR in mind.  You can use the vive  Motion controlers and it just feels natural.  IHavent tested network play or how many levels in game yet but this definetely feels like a game worth playing unlike most of the VR titles out so far, Been disappointed with the lack of content on VR  but its looking like the tide is about to change.

												Needs better weapon item system like in mario cart. Very boring system, no piazzezz or cool items to get. Like mario kart without jumping, cool power ups, comedy, interesting levels like up or down hills, and the point of view is to high over the cart. Vive controllers are useless. This really could kick♥♥♥♥♥if they fixed those issues. I was hoping for a mariocart type vr game. I only played this for like 20 mins...it is way too boring. Devs u can still salvage this and I will be more then happy to praise this game.			"

												Hi,I know 8 Min is short fo a review but i strongly recommend reading this before you buys the game:I got so motions sick that i struggled to complete even the tutorials.(PS ! I get motion sickness easy but before you get this)Try your self in the following free games: ""InMind VR"" and ""InCell VR"".If you get motion sickness from these, then you will most likely have the same problem here.If not, This game could be fun.Controlls are not made for the Vive controllers they are ported, wich means game will tell you to press A, B, X, Y, LB RB and so on (I could not find a way to change this). You will not stear with the controls as VR would suggest, insted turning left and right is a button press.To me, these 2 points are game breakers.This is the first negative review i have written for VR but feels that others should have this in mind when bying this game.There is probably alot of content and the game looks fun but I just simply can not play this due to the motion sickness.Hopes this was helpfull.

												A great little racer, well worth the money. It'll be even better when there are more people to race against online. Only issue I had is with the controls - it forced me to use an Xbox controller because it wouldn't pick up Right trigger when using the motion controls. Apart from that, it's a really fun game, the courses are decent and the power-ups are well balanced. Definitely recommend.			"

												I'll start by saying that the idea is nice but there is too much holding it down.First the controls are just garbage. Using the motion controllers as just controllers and hrobile controls at that. Most of the time I cannot turn and drive right off the track. Had to drop the motion controllers and pick up a normal one just to drive correctly.Next the AI are impractical. I've intentionally saved a full boost and used it right after an AI just used there boost and they were still right behind me.  And this will also be the same AI that used its boost everytime it picked it up so I know it wasn't also full on boost.The next fustrating thing, and one of my big pet peeve of this game and when the AI hits you from behind, logic would say that you will get a small push but instead, you slow down, and the AI get a small boost and passes you. What is the reason for the mirrors, if blocking someone only works against you.The game has potential but it still needs more work.			"
