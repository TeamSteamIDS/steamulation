												If you're a fan of Pagani and interested in getting into sim racing this is the game for you. While it is lacking in tracks, features and cars that doesn't matter because this is really more of a demo for the full game than anything else.The majority of complaints coming from others about the handling are completely justified because as a racing simulator, Project Cars almost demands a racing wheel to be enjoyed. However with some tweaking of the in game settings you can easily set up a controller to work fairly well. I can't stress the simulation aspect enough as without driving assists the cars on offer can be fairly difficult to control especially because none of the lower powered street cars are available in the demo. The game also tracks tire temperature but fails to explain that for maximum grip to be achieved the tires have to reach a certain temperature (around 100° C) so a minimum of 1 lap needs to be completed before the cars handle properly. The cars on offer all kick side to side when leaving the pit and when quickly accelerating can easily spin out so a controller just won't offer enough degrees of motion to counter act this without assists. I personally use a Logitech G29 with a shifter and in both the full game and this demo the cars are perfectly manageable to drive albeit with some practice.Some people will try and convince you that this is just an arcadey version of Assetto Corsa which simply put it's not. Both games while racing simulators have very different design philosophies and so deciding which one you prefer will really come down to personal preference. A point to consider is that Project Cars has a demo now while Assetto Corsa doesn't. Like the full game however this demo carries over the weather settings from the full game for the race weekends which adds variety, unfortunately car tuning options are not present in the demo as far as I can tell.Considering that Project Cars with all the dlc is still fairly expensive even when on sale, downloading the fairly small demo isn't a bad idea to get an idea whether or not sim racing is for you. If you find you don't like this demo at least you don't need to worry about exceeding your refund period.			"

												I downloaded this demo to see if I could play this without a steering wheel set-up. Bad idea.Not impossible with a keyboard or with a xbox controller but don't bother buying the full game if you don't have at least a cheap steering wheel set-up. The amount of customization options in this game is awesome though.			"

												Really enjoying Project CARS Pagani edition. I have yet to purchase Project Cars because I saw discussions in the forums of the game having trouble with AMD graphic cards. So I was excited to try the free Pagani Edition to both test the game and because I have been wanting to try a a driving sim  with my HTC Vive. I used a Xbox360 madcatz steering wheel that I have had for years now. The game instantly detected the wheel and it worked flawlessly but given the limitation of my admittedly cheap wheel hardcore driving fans would be better off  buying a better sim steering wheel. The game ran smoothly with no drops in framerate at all, even after increasing world detail settings. The game didnt need any additional configuring with the HTC Vive, my AMD R9 390x gfx card, or when using the the 360 steering wheel. I did have to adjust my in game seat position inside the game because I felt a little off center from the weel but the settings option handled it beautifully. Menus were also easy to navigate in VR with the way you gaze at menu options and press the ""A"" button on the wheel to select the highlighted choice.Since I never played the game before and especially not in VR I played on novice and ran a few laps. Novice provided driving lines for the curves of the track. The computer was not shy about bumping which made driving for the first few times both hectic and fun but felt out of place for a sim racer when bumped but it also allows you to power into turns and bounce off vehicles while still learning the turns of the track. I'm not prone to VR or Motion sickeness but felt it very slightly after driving extremely erratically after bouncing into cars and walls but after quitting the feeling quickly went away. After playing Pagani edition I'll probaby definetly pick up the full game soon.			"

												On keyboard : EDIT 2: {On hard difficulty without any assistance + full damage + Pagani Zonda Revolucion the handling is like hell. You'll spin more than a dog chasing it's own tail lol. }EDIT: {After playing it a bit more I decided to buy the full game (when it will be on sale ofc). It's very challenging on medium diff. (haven't tried hard difficulty yet) The secret to make the game playable is to lower steering, breaking and throttle sensitivities(Controls -> Configuration) to 24-27 depends on you. The Nurburgring feels great now.Also BIG PRO : Very fast loading time( < 1 min).}Default controls are hard to get used to but with a bit of patience and also some research on internet( I haven't tried yet ) they can be adjusted.Very good graphics, running smooth on high to ultra on FX 6300 / GTX 750 TI.Graphics / control / audio etc. can't be changed on track. You can only in main menu, which is incredibly annoying, having to enter a race, then quit it just to edit control sensitivity values wtf. This is lame.Also , restart for graphics effects to take effect.The (EDIT) crashing physics are unrealistic.I loved the crash visuals, made my car look like a sandwich. A lot of thanks to devs for making this game free!! (I recommend it because it's free ,otherwise I won't.)			"

Demo to the full game - try it before you buy it.Project CARS - Pagani Edition features a roster of 5 cars - guess what make, and 3 tracks - Monza, Cote D'Azure and the full Nurburgring circuit, and singleplayer practice or quick races with up to 25 opponents.It looks pretty sweet. Car models are perfect but something about their shaders still puts me off, just like Shift 2 Unleashed did. Track detail is great, and overall graphics and visuals are extensively customizable and it seems to run well on a laptop with a quad core i7, 8GB of RAM and a GTX950M GPU without losing its shine.I fire this up sometimes just to hear the amazing roar of 20+ Zonda Cinques launching on Monza. The cars sound properly mental and pretty close to the real thing, but still not quite.It's a simulation racer, and yet it doesn't really handle so well on a gamepad. Cars still have that lightness, bounciness and aggravating oversteering tendency as they did in Shift 2 Unleashed - fittingly, it's the same game engine. Zonda Cinques and Huayras are the limit of my capability to effectively handle them, anything higher is out of my league sadly. It really pushes to be an enthusiast's simulator yet it doesn't feel like a simulator the way, say, Assetto Corsa does.Pre-race settings include setting your opponents' skills, numbers and whether to use the same car or same car class. You can also fiddle with the dynamic weather and day-night cycle, make them faster or slower and such. ""Authenticity"" settings control the degree of simulation, except it's either the general car assists (antilock brakes, traction control and stability control) or damage, tyre wear and fuel rate. It is stupid to have a garage feature where you can see and ""choose"" car liveries, if they don't save for the race anyway. I like certain designs better than others, so let me race in those.If you've got a steering wheel set, you should give the Pagani Edition demo a try before making any decision. If you have only a gamepad or keyboard then you should still give it a go, if only for the amazing sound of 24 Cinques launching. I personally am not sold on the delivery of Project CARS.			"

												Great intro to VR racing.  For free and get to race Pagani's?   Signed up.It gets you into VR without too much difficulty through the options and allowing you to start in VR,  No need to setup any new room setup.  Once in the game, you can set an option to reset head position to where you're currently at.I reduced most of the settings to low for my 970 and it ran smoothly.I'm using an X360 controller and read that the default might not be the best settings for it.  Google and find the right settings for your controller.  I set them up right for it and controls felt good.If you don't want to look, copy this and try it.  I copied it from posts I found for X360 controller..X360Steering dead zone: 0Steering Sensitivity: 15Throttle dead zone: 0Throttle Sensitivity: 50Brake dead zone: 0Brake Sensitivity: 25Clutch dead zone: 0Clutch Sensitivity: 45Speed Sensitivity: 60Controller Filtering: 50Force Feedback: 100Advanced: Off			"

												Relative to Assetto Corsa this is very arcade, an excellent stepping stone from console fare like Forza and GRan Turismo.  The demo has a good selection of fast cars and the 'ring.  Honestly for most casual racers the demo is probably more content than you'll need as you can spend hundreds of hours bashing round the 'ring improving your time.  Fortunately if you do decide to dedicate hours to the demo you'll find that it looks stunning.  While lacking the clean lines of iRacing it is more than a match for Forza and AC in the prettyness stakes.If you like this get the full game.If you find this too arcade get AC.If you find this laughably arcade get iRacing.

												Very fun game, definitely give it a try if you have the time and own a racing wheel.I played this with a Logitech G27.At the beginning the game lets you select a difficulty preset. If you're like me and usually play arcade racing games (such as Need for Speed), I'd recommend starting on the novice difficulty. I found it to be quite challenging, even with some of the driving aids. Spinning out can happen if you're not careful with the throttle, especially coming out of a turn while in lower gears.The graphics look really good and the game ran very smooth on the pre-configured settings. (i5, 16GB RAM, geforce GTX 970). I thought some of the engine sounds were really cool aswell.The Integration of the G27 was good. The game preconfigured everything, no manual editing/calibration required.Force feedback worked well,too. Also no additional tweaking required.I'm by far no expert in racing sims, but here are my 2ct about the physics:The cars behave pretty stable in most situations. The only thing you have to look out for is applying too much throttle, which causes your wheels to spin out sometimes. Driving off the track, or having one wheel in the grass, does not spin you out. It just slows you down a bit and makes steering harder. Although this is probably not realistic, I liked the slightly more arcady feel.All in all this is a cool demo (5 Cars and 3 Tracks playable), and it was definitely worth playing.			"

												Im giving this game a thumbs up as its great to see a mostly fully functional demo like this. For me its a handy tool to see if its worth buying the full version. Sadly, playing the demo has left me firmly deciding to leave my money in bank account. Its pretty thats for sure. Graphical effects are far beyond AC and of course there is night and rain to add to graphical splendor. TBH i didnt notice a huge performance hit either compared to the much simpler looking AC. Problem here tho, is even tho PC is prettier, AC looks more realistic when your concentrating on your driving. Its cleaner and less cluttered and just looks more real. If less fancy. And thats PC trump card. To drive AC blows it away. The feedback and handling in AC is just in another world. I guess if you only played PC itd be ok, but once you play AC, PC just doesnt feel right. And thats the killer. PC has a lot going for it (not including the annoying guy who keeps stating the obvious) but the handling and feedback just arent good enough for a 'sim'. The anciant GTR2 has it taped, i dread to think what RF2 or automobilsta would do to it (I aint played them 2 yet) Also, where AC is constantly being updated PC is dead while PC2 is developed. AC adds lots of little features that PC doesnt have and the sound in AC is much, much better. I really wanted to want PC due to its night, rain, vive support and graphics. But i dont :(  "

												Reviewed with a Thrustmaster T300RS + 599XX Alcantara + T3PA pedals on ultra settings with all assists off.As I never played PCARS this is an excellent opportunity for me but actually for everyone to get a feel of how this racing simulation behaves.Pros:+ Graphics (both car and track)+ Force Feedback+ Handling is simulationlike+ External Sounds+ Runs very well on maximum settings+ Very nice menu music+ Easy to use HUD and UICons:- Handling also is rather icey resulting in snap oversteer where there shouldn't be.- Internal sounds are lacking- Monza and Nordschleife although graphically stunning don't seem correct with too much bumps and banked turns in the wrong locations.As this is a racing simulator, the handling and FFB of the entire game is what makes or breaks it. The FFB imo is very well done, and can easily be adjusted to your own preferences using a ton of sliders. My T300RS and 599XX Alcantara made me feel like I was in control while the FFB gave me the information I needed to know what was going on.However, although the handling is simulator like with all assists off (how else can you test a simulator anyway), the cars their default setups made handling rather twitchy and unforgiving. The Zonda R for example could use some more diff coast lock and a bit less of weirdly aligned gearbox setting to make it all a bit more less leathal.All in all a very decent demo that I can recommend for anyone who wants to know what PCARS feels like. Would I buy PCARS myself? Probably not, the interior sounds kill it for me, and in this demo you can't setup your car, so although I can only speculate that will remedy the handling issue I can't know for certain.			"

												Project CARS - Pagani Edition is an amazingly realistic racing game that works perfectly well without VR as well, on a standard monitor.  The graphics are spectacular, the driver feel is very immersive, and the sound engaging. The game gives you the optimum driving line if you want to perfect your driving, which is a nice touch.Make up your own mind with this gameplay:

												Project CARS - Pagani Edition is a free edition with the sole purpose of being a taste of what the full retail version of Project CARS is like. You are given the option of choosing between 4 Pagani vehicles and 3 track locations to drive them on. Considering that this is a racing simulator, I truly enjoyed it being a fan of these type of games.Pros:-Ability to launch in VR - through either the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift-Large amount of customization with regards to controls for steering wheel controllers-Offers a solid, well balanced glimpse of what you can expect from the full version-Soundtrack is nice, offers splendid tracks while you are driving-Graphics are beautiful and well optimized-Offers solid, realistic driving simulation, proving to be challenging and enjoyableCons:-Playing using a keyboard is quite a challenge, and is definitely more difficult than with a steering wheel.This is a great glimpse at what Project CARS is all about, a realistic driving simulator. If you are looking for a hardcore driving experience, give this a go before you purchase Project CARS.7/10			"

												If this is a simulator racing game with realistic controls, I'm really disappointed as what get passed up as realistic controls these days. Other older racing games have much better realistic controls than this. Then the maps... blocking the run-off area speedtrap with cones in Monza? Really? The speedtrap in the run-off area is supposed to slow people down who overshoot the first corner in Monza, and you guys couldn't figure out what the tire walls were for, so you just added cones there for no reason? Even the cars sound generic. I've seen videos where people play this and the car engine sounds are pretty much all the same. Menu screens are also a mess, just pick the most realistic option you can at the start so you don't have to mess with the settings too much.			"

At the start of this race, the frame rate is below 30 fps. That's because my potato laptop PC has been running two 10 mins practice sessions, one 10 mins qualifying and one 10 mins warm-up sessions before the race. So it's already running hot and furthermore there are still a few more options i can lower down to get better frame rates. With the recorder running and the options are not at the lowest levels, it runs quite well all things considered.As a racing game modelling real cars and tracks, it's looks very good, In terms of authenticity, keyboard handling and game performance, it's good. In terms of options, OMG!! there's plenty to tweak so what's there not to like? You could do worse with a paid game in all aspects. This game gives you full control over the settings to make it just the way you like.The AI behaviour is realistic and governed by the same physics, in other words they don't cheat or try to overly frustrate you by bumping your car or trying to run you off the track. I can't remember if this was at easy or medium AI. At higher level they would be more aggressive and faster ofcourse.So yeah i will probably buy this game but for now i already have a backlog of older racing titles that run buttery smooth waiting to be completed on my potato PC.

No fighting with the wheel, requires decent amount of throttle control which is great. Overall car does exactly what I want it to.If I had more free time I would definitely buy Project Cars.			"

												WOW! Definitely going to get the full edition. And for all the people complaing about the handling, this is a simulator, not NFS or Forza. There's a reason they recommend you learn to drive a car like this if you buy one, because 800 BHP does things to traction.			"

												I already have Project cars but I installed this to give it a try to a Pagani Car, i dont have a steering wheel but i use a playstation 4 controller with a custom settings. I played and is the same experience than projects cars obviously with less cars and tracks. This demo offer exactly what people need, show the quality graphic of the game, check if your computer can run it, check the steering wheel support, try the controls, cars and  tracks. I dont understand the people who complain about the controls because they lose the control of the car every time, you cant drive over 280 Km/h and dont brake in the corner, you cant pedal to metal in a corner or even in a straight line because you will spin using the fastest cars. Even with all the assist the game is difficult to play and became imposible if you play it like a Need for speed or drive like in GTA. Keep in mind, this is not a arcade game is a simulator, and only achieve this when you are commited.			"

												I recommend this for anyone who, like myself, has been considering purchasing Pcars. Playing this for maybe 4 minutes was enough to make me forget that silly idea. I value the physics of a driving game more than any other aspect. The physics of Pcars are laughable. It's evident that the physics and the sensation of actually driving a car was near the bottom on the list of priorities when they developed the game. In case you're dumb and somehow haven't bought Asseto Corsa yet, do yourself a favor and do that.			"

												I have stayed away from this game since it launched, mostly because of the criticism from their own user base; didn't even want to buy at readuced price.But free is good; downloaded it today and raced the Zonta Roadster at Monza; pretty impressive feeling of physics, strong force feedback, you need to work to stay fast on track; pretty realistic graphics.I may consider to go for the full game soon; this free but fully functional stuff idea worked for me.

												I tried this out as Project CARS was one of the games I was interested in from the Humble Bundle.Based on this DEMO, I will not be purchasing the Bandai-Namco Humble Bundle.This game does not feel fun with a controller or keyboard.

												I had never own any racing games on my PC but I play some before on console.What good about this Project Cars - Pagani Edition??This is the 1st time I saw a racing games that goes free in steam  d^.^band is not any crappy looking outdated rubbish freebies that dish out to us.It has a very decent graphic an not taxing our graphic card.Heck is a good freebies.About the gameplay... it's really killing our palm & finger. We have to really strain....... our finger to adjust the correct pressure on LT & RT button,else we get alot under steering and over steering.Try adjust the throttle & braking sensitivity it might help abit ...abit....For keyboard & mouse user I think this is gonna be one tough crappy control game here.Would I recommend this game??I'd to sayeth alot more car racing games had a better control, but it come with cost.Project Cars -Pagani Edition It take time to master.Is hard to drive without crashing...Every divider, fender, rubbish bin and spin alot in the track.This game would not suit everyone but...is still a very good A Class freebies here.It doesn't harm to try'em out "

												Great game. Gives you the thrill of racing in high speeds in a rainy day.PROS:- Free!- Nice graphics. Could drop some jaws- Good control. I have a Logitech F510 and it works like a charm, way better than NFS Shift 2 BTW.- FREE!- The cars give you the essential experience of what Project CARS has to offer.CONS:- No Music, Forgivable. Even the full version ain't got much music on it unless you connect it to spotify which only makes sense if you're inside US. My solution is to jack up Gran Tursimo 5's OST or FORZA 4's OST, whatever you choose!- The physics system sometimes behaves awkwardly. Definitely forgivable.Special thanks to PAGANI and Project CARS team for freeing this package. It really is a pleasure to have this hilarious thing for free.			"

												Very much reminiscent of the sampler discs you could find at supermarkets and gas stations for the racing games of yesteryear, this makes for a neat little pick-up-and-play affair, containing three tracks (Monza, Azure Coast, and Nurburgring GP + Nordschliefe Combined) and five Pagani vehicles (variants of the Huayra and Zonda). I haven't played the full game and was on the fence about it, and so jumped at the chance to give this a play.I was afraid it'd be a little heavily simulation for my tastes, as I tend to lean firmly towards simcade styles, but it turns out it's pretty heavily adjustable. Coming off of GRID Autosport and Dirt to Daytona, I was rather satisfied with the Amateur settings for the most part. It definitely is an immersive experience, with absolutely glorious sound on headphones and some really solid, detailed vibration + handling on an Xbox 360 controller (I know, I know, it's not a wheel, so sue me. Didn't wanna bother digging the Logitech out). With no rewind function and a rather tricky-to-read (at high speeds anyhow) course map, it definitely is one that wants you to drop everything else and just focus on the race in the moment.The very nicely steady framerate, refreshing lack of aliasing, and, well, the utter lack of the bizarre, disturbing omnipresent sheen that makes the cars look like they were drowned in wax in all the trailers makes for a very smooth visual experience, too. If you have Damage set to Visual and aren't afraid to make contact, though, you'll find this can quickly devolve into a hilarious multi-million-dollar game of bumper cars, the likes of which should make a Need for Speed fan feel right at home. The Huayra is a very satisfying drive, if much too fast and fragile for a usual beginner car, so experience with lots of other racers is recommended. The Zondas, however, I found a bit floaty to use, and skidded off the course with routinely. I'm used to stock cars and ovals, though, so there is bias there.The courses are excellent, and by that I mean 2 out of 3 isn't bad. Monza is a classic course and lives up to the legend, with smartly aggressive AI tactics. Azure Coast is a frantic, scenic point-to-point race. And Nurburgring combined is... well, it's got novelty factor but in practice is an absolutely terrible idea. It takes so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to finish a single lap that doing the two laps it has by default actually took me as long as setting up the entire game and finishing both courses before it. It's worth a tour so you can say you've done it, but it isn't actually fun.So I'd say it's absolutely worth a look, even if just for a short while, and piqued my interest in the title it's ripped from. It seems the high degree of customization - especially getting to shut off those garish hovering driver names that take up most of the screen, ugh - makes for a fine little timewaster if you're in the mood for a bit of virtual tourism at high speeds.

I haven't played the full game and was on the fence about it, and so jumped at the chance to give this a play.I was afraid it'd be a little heavily simulation for my tastes, as I tend to lean firmly towards simcade styles, but it turns out it's pretty heavily adjustable. Coming off of GRID Autosport and Dirt to Daytona, I was rather satisfied with the Amateur settings for the most part. It definitely is an immersive experience, with absolutely glorious sound on headphones and some really solid, detailed vibration + handling on an Xbox 360 controller (I know, I know, it's not a wheel, so sue me. Didn't wanna bother digging the Logitech out). With no rewind function and a rather tricky-to-read (at high speeds anyhow) course map, it definitely is one that wants you to drop everything else and just focus on the race in the moment.The very nicely steady framerate, refreshing lack of aliasing, and, well, the utter lack of the bizarre, disturbing omnipresent sheen that makes the cars look like they were drowned in wax in all the trailers makes for a very smooth visual experience, too. If you have Damage set to Visual and aren't afraid to make contact, though, you'll find this can quickly devolve into a hilarious multi-million-dollar game of bumper cars, the likes of which should make a Need for Speed fan feel right at home. The Huayra is a very satisfying drive, if much too fast and fragile for a usual beginner car, so experience with lots of other racers is recommended. The Zondas, however, I found a bit floaty to use, and skidded off the course with routinely. I'm used to stock cars and ovals, though, so there is bias there.The courses are excellent, and by that I mean 2 out of 3 isn't bad. Monza is a classic course and lives up to the legend, with smartly aggressive AI tactics. Azure Coast is a frantic, scenic point-to-point race. And Nurburgring combined is... well, it's got novelty factor but in practice is an absolutely terrible idea. It takes so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to finish a single lap that doing the two laps it has by default actually took me as long as setting up the entire game and finishing both courses before it. It's worth a tour so you can say you've done it, but it isn't actually fun.So I'd say it's absolutely worth a look, even if just for a short while, and piqued my interest in the title it's ripped from. It seems the high degree of customization - especially getting to shut off those garish hovering driver names that take up most of the screen, ugh - makes for a fine little timewaster if you're in the mood for a bit of virtual tourism at high speeds.

												I have played this game for an hour or so. So far I like it very much. Its difficult to drive and I was amazed that they included the entire nurenburgring in this package. I would recommend everybody who loves racing to just install this even if you have a slow pc like me (gt 650m), im getting about 30fps on low. And to everybody who is critisizing it. It is free. Thanks project cars :)			"

												A little under two hours of troubleshooting later and the lag in VR mode (Don't know about standard desktop mode, I haven't tried it) is still completely unfixable.  I'm running this on a GTX 980 with an i7 6700 and 32gb RAM and this game still can't keep a decent framerate on its lowest settings. A real shame because I was looking forward to using my racing wheel with the vive but the lag is just too nauseating.			"

												Looks Great and Sounds Great.Yes you can use a controller. I used Input Mapper and a PS4 controller. Worked just fine. You may want to play with the sensitivity a bit.This demo of sorts gives no starter tracks and cars, you are put in a Zhonda and set on the infamous Nurburgring track with 19 other Zhondas and expected to hold your own at a break neck pace.In short, very well done.It sounds very good, when I was using the second car model, everytime I let off the gas and then stomped it again the turbo sounded like a freaking WHIP CRACK ! Love it.My only complaint is the technical aspects, if you accidentally run off the road you get accused of cutting the track, whether you were or not. So in this regard, Gran Turismo still holds my heart in the racing genre. If you want technical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, then go get your real racing license. This is a game.  You're going off the pavement from time to time in a 800+ Hp race car, deal with it.Still an exhilarating experience to say the least. Crank up the volume and you will soon find your hands sweating trying to get around the track as fast and careful as possible.			"

												It's a hassel to control, not the best game for me. On the lowest of graphics settings it will lag immensely and ruin you driving. There's a setting that will automatically play for you, all you need to do is press the gas. The game is a bit too real with the driving physics when you actually control it, except for when you randomly drive up and over cars. The default controls are the weirdest I've seen from any game. The graphics can be stunning, but I'm not able to use it. The developers should try to make the coding more efficient so the game lags less, that should be their focus. Should add coarses, add currency, and add street racing. Again AMAZING GRAHPICS. Needs work.			"

												This version of the game is basically a sampling of three tracks (with variations) and several Pagani cars. You can't complain about the price, and it does give you a feel for the broader experience with the full version on Project Cars.That said, the game has very basic issues with playability on a controller. Even if you dial in a totally ideal set of variables for one car (which in itself isn't all that simple), those same controller settings are likely to be a mismatch for the next car. This is exacerbated but higher-performance cars. It's strange and frustrating. The visual presentation is solid, with the sort of adjustments you'd hope for in any PC title. On a higher-end i7, there was still some performance variability with a full track of AI drivers with otherwise appropriate visual settings.			"

												I'm not so good at the realistic type supercar racing games and I found this so difficult. Very hard to keep straight and avoid spinning but once I learned to not go full throttle all the time and especially to slow down a lot for bends it started to become enjoyable and made me want to learn. For a freebie to have a quick race it's great. Excellent graphics. I would love to have a go VR stylee but simply cannot afford it and will not be able to for a good while, living in hope that the prices will come down a lot in the not too distant future.Beautiful CarsGood GraphicsRealisticGreat Price (Free)VR (for those with vive or rift)Recommended "

												The biggest problems with this game are the steering and throttle sensitivity with a wheel. Steering feels way too twitchy, even at low values. Combine this with the really responsive throttle and you will spin on most corners. It's not normal to do a 360 spin even at a gentle tap of the pedal.Otherwise, it's a nice game for it's price (free) and runs well on lower end gpu's (easily pulling 60-70 FPS on a GTX 750 Ti with medium preset).

												Forza 6 Apex is the superior demo. My main gripe with this demo is some questionable sounds. The turbo charged cars sound awful. If you go full throttle and let off when the turbo spools on the Huayra, you can continue to hear the audio lag behind your input as the turbo spools when you're off throttle. It really kills it for me personally, especially with Forzas best in class sound design being offered free with a demo as well, and I think Assetto Corsa is superior too. Assetto Corsa and Forza also beat it in physics I think. Assetto Corsa feels amazing with a wheel, and Forza feels really solid with a controller. For some reason snap oversteer in Project Cars feels really questionable and unrealistically unforgiving. Not that I've ever experienced oversteer (or any kind of steering for that matter) in a Pagani, but it just feels strange to me. Maybe it's the lack of audio queus when you start to lose grip, or maybe the controller sensitivity was causing me to overcompensate. I just couldn't get the hang of it; I'm not really sure what the problem is. Something just seemed off to me about the oversteer in Project Cars. I'm really not convinced by this demo. I think you'd be better off with Assetto Corsa. It looks better, it sounds better, it feels better with a racing wheel peripheral, the DLC is really quality, and overal I just think it's the superior racing sim on PC. Also check out Forza Apex if you can stomach the Windows Store; it's free as well and there is FAR more content.			"

												Decent for free to play, would reccoment picking it up if you have an hour to kill. It will become stale pretty fast though as you are only playing with 5 cars and 3 tracks but it is bascially the full project cars engine, with limited assets, for free. The AI is very dynamic too, a lot of fun to play with difficulty setting etc. There are lots of race settings and assists to play around with as well so you could get a few hours of play from it.

												I'm going to give a thumbs up simply because I know this is enjoyable with a wheel; but for gamepad users, this game is nothing but an excercise in frustration. I've been using gamepads in racing simulations for well over 15years, and the way PCars handles analog gamepad interpolation for steering is the worst I've seen in a long time.With a wheel, it's a completely different game and very enjoyable, but if you're one of those people who can't use/don't have a wheel, I would skip Pcars and go straight to Assetto Corsa (which IMO handles analog gamepads better than anyone right now).

												I can't recommend this due to the awkward physics and artistic license taken on Nordschleife's design. I know this Nordschleife is not laser-scanned, but some things, like the castle, are absurdly inaccurate in their rendering. It's like they didn't bother to look at photos and videos as they were designing it. Also, the horizon is 100's of meters too high, which is really noticeable around Schwedenkreuz and Döttinger Höhe. The horizon is even towering over Hohe Acht - the highest part of the track! This makes it look like I am surrounded by much higher mountains and I lose the sense of altitude I should have. In a way, the entire track looks more like a rendition from memory than an actual rendering from photo and video assets.The physics feel weird in that I spin out when I barely turn too quick and at other times I feel glued in place. It's like there is no enertia, then all of a sudden there is too much. The physics do not feel quite arcade-like, just wierd. It goes to show you still how advanced rfactor 1 is in some regards, since it feels leaps and bounds better than this. I suppose I could be biased towards actual realistic physics and not being fair, but I absolutely don't want the ""creative"" and ""stylish"" physics that Pcars has. With rfactor 1, you could turn on all the aids and a toddler could probably win races. Pcars physics seem harder to play since they don't follow how one would expect a vehicle to actually behave. Even some simplified arcade style physics, like in Grand Theft Auto games, seem to have more basis in realism than Pcars.I'd agree with others that view this as basically being Shift 3. I can only assume that PCars 2 will be Shift 4. Count me out.Going back to Assetto Corsa was such a relief that I feel spoiled by it with its superior physics and laser-scanned Nordschliefe with a castle that looks like the real one. Assetto Corsa feels like a simulation, whereas PCars feels like a simulation of a simulation.			"

												I'm very happy that there was an opportunity to play 'Project Cars' for free, after deliberation on whether to add this to my collection or not, I finally have my answer.It's not going to be a purchase for me.Racing games are held in a market at the moment where the big titles cover pretty much all corners of the racing genre. from Dirt, NFS, Forza, GT. Project Cars offers nor brings anything new to the table, nothing stands out and it does very little to try. Simulation is done better elsewhere as is arcade racing.The graphics on the cars are nice, however it's painfully obvious that's where the team have spent most of their time. The cockpit modes are beautifully detailed with the ability to actually take a view inside the drivers helmet and a rare mid-seat (between driver and passenger) view. However car detail is already something Forza nailed 3 editions ago, shiny cars is not a big selling point anymore, NFS have been doing it for years.This means the enviroments of the tracks are not as well established as the cars, there is something eerily arcadey about the graphics I can't quite describe. It could possibly be the over saturation of the colours that gives the vibes of Ridge Racer rather than Gran Turismo.The car mechanics are serviceable, the power cars rip from your grip if your not gentle on the gas. It's nice to lose control if your not paying attention. However this seems to be a little bit on the sensitive side, a steady pace on a straight will not send a car suddenly veering off into a 360 spin if the controls are not handled. Something with the reverse of some of the cars is also off, they seem to have the turning circle of a cruise ship. Trying to reverse in a 180 can find your car taking a long time to actually move in any angle of note and ram from one side of the track to another. It's like controlling a 1 wheeled shopping cart.The many configurations for major racing wheels and other lower market ones are great, if you use a wheel it's likely to have an option for you.In summary it suffers from the lack of any real purpose. It adds nothing other titles haven't already covered, instead ticking all the tropes the genre has done time and time again including an overused cliche talking menu. Very Dirt 3.5/10 "

												Seems like an awesome game. But I don't have a steering wheel, and the Xbox controller is impossible to use. If you even touch the stick to attempt to steer, you are just going to spin in circles and never stop. Until they do something about the stick sensitivity, this game is impossible to play with anything other than a wheel, and probably only the best, most expensive wheels.			"

												The BEST racing game out there ! Better than Assetto Corsa. And you will need a steering wheel for the best immersiom or at least a controller. Don't even think about playing racing games with a keyboard or mouse because you'll get nowhere !!			"

												The force feedback in this game is a joke. It feels like that daytona game at the arcade. No feeling of grip, or lock, nothing. Just lifeless. Its absolutely nothing like an actual vehicle. Youre honestly better off using a controller and even then it still feels like youre driving on ice. And they managed to make the nordschleif feel like ♥♥♥. I have 80 hours on PCars I had it uninstalled for months and decided to see if anything got better. nope, still trash. If you own a wheel buy assetto corsa, rfactor, or iracing. if you own a console youll have some good simcade/arcade racers to choose from. dont bother wasting 9gbs, and please god dont buy the full game,its dead and the devs left it unfinshed to develop the sequal.

												I'm so glad a free version of this game was released since there's no demo. I now know to stay away from it. I'm a huge fan of all racing games from arcade to sim, but this game disappoints. There seemed to be so much hype around this game - especially over the graphics, but even on max settings it looks mediocre at best; certainly no better than Forza Motorsport 5. The default camera Field of Views are so wrong, the controller settings are wrong, everything needs a heck of a lot of tweaking to get right out of the box, you can't adjust any of the controls, graphics or audio while in a race. The driving itself feels very boring, sedate and unresponsive. You can't really get a feel for the car and its grip or speed in any of the camera views; which is odd considering that Slightly Mad Studios did a tremendous job with the Need for Speed SHIFT games.I think it's great that a free version is available, but even so this game fails to impress or stand out on any level. I'm sure there's some potential in there somehwere, but I certainly can't see it. If you want a great driving game, look elsewhere. If you want a simulator... well, I really couldn't care less about realism but even if I did this certainly wouldn't be the game that comes to mind based on my first impressions.			"

												I tried playing this with a DualShock 4 controller, as a veteran of Gran Turismo, WipeOut, Dirt Rally and most recently RedOut (all played with DualShock controllers). The default throttle settings were awful, going into wheel-spin and car sliding all over the place with the slightest squeeze on the triggers (even with so-called traction control on). In the end, I turned up the throttle deadzone to 70 (from 15) and the throttle sensitivity to 0 (from 30). These changes almost made the game playable, but still had some over accelerating when I was trying to be careful. Before you think, ""oh controller issue"", note that many, many other reviews note precisely the same irrespective of the control method! I note that the deadzone setting isn't really a deadzone, but a less sensitive region of the trigger ""axis"". The physics were awful, in one place hitting a dust bin results in a spin (as it might), but then cars bumping into each other seem to bounce around like they have zero weight, simply crap. Graphically, I found the game OK, but nothing spectacular. The main feeling that I got from the experience was to emphasise how good Forza Apex is (with most of the assists turned off, and where I had a very nice control experience from first loading up the game and driving multiple types of cars). I was always curious about Project CARS, but if this experience is representative of the full game, then I certainly do not want to buy it.			"

My Thoughts:My 1st ever driving experience in VR and it was absolutely exhilarating! PLUS it was FREE and most importantly.... I didn't finish last!Game Details:'Project CARS – Pagani Edition' Features the Pagani Huayra, Huayra BC, Zonda Cinque, Zonda R, and Zonda Revolucion, and three intricately modeled tracks — the Nürburgring and Nordschleife combo, Monza GP, and Azure Coast — along with two game modes, and full VR support on both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, as well as support for 4K screens and traditional displays. This free, PC-only game has been built around the market-leading Project CARS simulation, and is the result of a unique collaboration with legendary Italian car-maker Pagani Automobili. Designed to showcase both the very best examples of Pagani’s eponymous supercars along with the world-class technology that underpins the best-selling Project CARS simulation, 'Project CARS – Pagani Edition' is an invitation to encounter the digital integration of high-octane hypercars with cutting-edge racing-game technology.

												Like the full P-CARS this game suffers with the same issue: random spin out, BUT at a lower frequency. I will be copying and pasting my review of Project CARS in this review as well. You can go around a hairpin turn full speed, full turning angle and not have a problem, the chicane you then want to turn into will make the whole car spin out and there is no recovery, no matter the throttle control/technique, turning, brakes, or hoping you'll deploy. AI is good, about the same for the full P-CARS. Weather is nice, alot better than the original P-CARS for some reason. Overall its a taste of what P-CARS is and it is free so I will say good job Slightly Mad Studios, but be aware that the original P-CARS (as typed below) and occasionally this game has a nasty side.NOTE: THE FOLLOWING IS MY REVIEW COPY AND PASTED FROM THE FULL VERSION OF PROJECT CARS, I FEEL I MUST ADD IT BECAUSE MOST OF WHAT IS WRITTEN ON MY P-CARS REVIEW IS APPLICABLE TO P-CARS Pagani Edition.THE OIL SLICK DRIVING SIMULATOR. Trying to drive a car in this game is unpredictable. It's like driving on super soft dragster tires and then suddenly having a set of cheap bald-to-the cords set of tires and the road being covered in PTFE and motor oil. I spent around 4.8 hours of playtime attempting to make it more playable to no avail. Setting everything to the EXTREME side of low sensitivity and such helped slightly but its like, again, driving on plastic toy car tires. I know how to drive and am no amateur with racing. This isn't realistic at all. Pertaining to the AI or what little I did play with AI, it seems fine.. I drove with rain on the track and its not much different from dry conditions. Graphically its nice, sounds are good (except for tunnel sounds, its a bit harsh), weather effects are nice as well. Selection of cars are decent, but to get more requires DLC and there isn't many everyday road cars.			"

												I am really grateful for this tech demo. I was able to check if this game ran on my hardware.It started well and promising, but then, and quite often during the race, the game would suddenly slow down/lag for a few seconds, I mean graphics would freeze, after which the game engine seemingly would want to catch up with the lost frames and would speed up. Not sure I could correctly describe the phenomenon, but maybe you get the idea.That lag totally screws up the game experience.I really wanted to buy the GOTY edition but I am taking it out of my cart.My hw specs:(ASUS X555LB)CPU i3 5010U 2.1GHzRAM 12 GBGPU GeForce 940M 2GB VRAMWindows 10 up-to-datenVidia Driver latest v376.331366x768, 60Hz			"

												I play a large range of driving games from simulations to arcade. I really like that they decided to push out a demo to try. Props for that. I'm trying to not be biased here.. However:(Played with a Steam controller)Pros:- Looks great.- Is free.- You get a decent selection of cars and maps. Cons:- Cars are too fast to really get a feel for the game for me.- Drifting is a bit broken. I get it's a simulator, but pushing the gas pedal halfway in first gear does NOT cause the car to do donuts. xD Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it was a little silly to spin out all over the place, for no reason. Verdict: I personally don't recommend as a driving option if you're used to Forza or NFS. It reminded me more of the Gran Turismo days. However, it's a free demo. Go try it for yourself. "

												I like a game with good collisions. Racing is important, very important as it is a racing game, but if you mess up, you want to be punished with amazing collisions. This game does not seem to do that. Was going too fast towards a sharp turn so I decided to hit another car in front to slow me down. He was doing 15, I was doing 55 ish. When I hit him, we both stopped. What sort of phyics is that? This was my very first crash and am I not impressed with the result. Second crash was a little better but it was a side swipe that made them spin into the grass which was nice but the fact that he recovered way too easy was also a bit of a let down. Graphically the game is amazing. The cars lose parts and you see the underneath which is cool but other than that, there is not much else going for it. tl;dr: Great to look at, horrible phyiscs. I am guessing the full game is more of the same so I am glad I didn't bother to get it.			"

												Arcade racing & car driving game.Great graphics and audio.Lacks a sense of roadfeel when you are driving down a straight line in the track with a controller. You can't feel the car's engine or the raw surface of the track in your controller*. Instead you float along the road feeling -nothing-. In fact, you are unable to feel the car hit a bump in the road despite hearing it impact the car. Lack of ability to set up a cars' tire pressure, or even camber.The only time you feel anything is when the car is losing traction, slidding, or in similar violent situations. Otherwise, there is nothing to let you keep a sense of connection with the car and track while driving cleanly. It should probably be noted that the default field of view settings are terrible. Reducing these from 80 degrees down to 66 or less, and activating the automated 'simulation' camera setting can actually go a long way to allowing you to drive the unwieldly pagani cars included in this demo. Unfortunately, these changes do nothing to address the lack of road feel in a controller. Perhaps the most damning issue in this arcade game.As a result not the game for me.*Not everyone has a wheel n' pedals setup or plays from a racing-rig. Particularly when traveling with a laptop or if they are mobility impaired.			"

												I played just about 40 minutes of this game and I really wasn't enjoying it. The handling is so strange and kinda unreal, when you try to accelerate while turning, the whole car just goes to the side and rotates by 180 degrees. Brakes are half-not functionable, you need to brake at least 100 meters before turning, brakes = unusable. The preset controls are really unusual and unpractical. I believe that after few hours of gameplay I could get used to it and I'll start to enjoy it, but now I'm just raging because I crash every 15 seconds. The only thing I really liked about this game is the graphics, It looks fantastic and it's optimised kinda well, I have 50-100 FPS on Ultra on my GTX760, i5-2500K and 8GB RAM. Overall I would give it 2/10 points just because the graphics and optimisation.			"

												A misguided racing simulator that doesn't warn buyers of it's brutally realistic handling.~I'm thankful to be able to try this game for free. And I know - being a demo - not many features will not be finished/present. But as soon as I started, I could see this game's biggest problem.Now before I begin; let me make it clear that I'm not saying that this game is bad. It's just for a select few - hence me not recommending it. Read my NOTE at the bottom for a difficulty comparison with DiRT 3.~I've played handfuls of simulators, and done my fair share of real-world racing in a variety of vehicles and environments, and from that I can tell that there's a massive amount of attention paid to how the cars handle in this game - and it's punishing. Even with a controller (Xbox 360) and a gentle driving style, I was constantly battling over/understeer, torque steering, fish tailing, and other handling troubles that real-world racers face. Now that's not a complaint, as it was very realistic and fully tested by skills (more than any other game/simulator I'd played)... ...but having a demo - the thing that's meant to get people interested - set on one of the most narrow and punishing tracks in the world (the Nurburgring) is asking for trouble. Especially when you put them in a ridiculously light, fast and overpowered Zonda racecar. Even the hosts of Topgear would struggle to handle such a beast, despite their day job of reviewing cars (many of them, supercars).~So, in short: Unless you are a HARDCORE racer who's done and dusted with all your other games of this kind - I'd advise leaving this particular one alone.NOTE: Just as a yardstick to compare my gaming skill level with your own - I can achieve 1st place in almost every event of DiRT 3 at full difficulty (no assists), and I could barely drive at a reasonable speed with even the slowest Zonda. God help you if you only have a Keyboard XD "

												I remember being quite exited for this game when it came out. I got a pirated copy to play before buying because there wasn't a demo and I'm very glad I did. I gave it a good try, I really did. I wanted to like it. The overall graphics are very underwhelming, but I don't care about that, I care about the force-feedback and physics. And they are terrible. If you do a jump or hit a wall, the car behaves so unlike a real car it's insane. Whether it's on a keyboard, gamepad, or wheel, cars are very hard to drive, and for a 'sim' driving the cars just don't feel right because of how bad the force-feedback is. This game is no different, it has however re-affirmed my decision to not buy Project CARS.			"

The cars also feel very weird. I have a Thrustmaster TX 458 Wheel, and i thought this game just felt so weird. The force feedback is just off, i cant explain it. Either way, this is a free game, so you might as well check it out if you're into racing, but if you expect to get a good sim experience from this, i doubt you will.			"

												Hey its free, thanks for that Dev's.But it's not for me.(Played with G27, ""Pro"" mode)I know the steam community loves to hear this, but, this isn't a Sim in my book. It's Not bad, its pretty close to AC I guess. But a lot of this dosn't really hold up to really hardcore sims. The tracks, Look like crap. The cars look great on the other hand. Physics dont feel right at all, rip out of a turn in 2nd no prob (if you have any xp in sim racing I think you'll know what I'm talking about). Hit the grass at 120mph all four wheels, no prob. Ride those curbs, no problem. The dmg is better than AC but still on the forgiving side. If you are looking to get started in Sim racing, but have never gotten your feet wet, I can see how PC and AC (AC is where I started) would be a great option but if you are a bit more, seasoned, I would pass on the full game.

												There is NO multiplayer!  The stream description is LYING.  Just a leaderboard to compare time trial times. All they had to do was say ""Leaderboards"" instead of ""Multiplayer"" and things would have been fine.If the devs cannot care to make an accurate description, then i do not care to have their game take up HDD space.END			"

												Not recomended. Says full Vive support. But not really. Vive controlers not used. You have to buy a seperate xbox controler or a steering wheel and pedal set up to play this????? Makes no sence....			"

												I reported that my particular type of steering wheel didn't work in their game about three years ago now, when I was in their alpha testing, and they STILL haven't fixed it! Both iRacing and Assetto Corsa have no issues with the wheel (and neither does any other game, it's just this one).Also, I find it hilarious that a game which essentially sells on its graphics, have basically turned all options off in VR. There isn't a single shadow anywhere to be seen (and I wonder if the strong sun rays shining in your face is an attempt to distract you from this fact). Even iRacing, with its 10 year old graphics now, look way better in VR!			"

												I UNAPOLOGETICALLY got my hands on Project Cars for free in the past because I'm very skeptical of all these games.   I'm looking for a fun driving game like Forza or F1 series from codemasters.  This game is NOT fun.  This is a super realistic tryhard overthought overdesigned game that at the same time is incredibly unrealistic.  This game and asseto corsica are so stupid and I really wish they'd bring Forza to PC or make a game that doesn't throw you in to the wall while going 40kms around a 140 degree turn or have crazy wheelspin where your tires never heat up.

												edit: Ok I think it's good to be able to admit when you're wrong and I'm doing that now.  I decided to give this another go, and found some tweaks which really made the FFB come alive and I'm shocked to say, felt BETTER than some sims in some regards.  For example I love how understeer is handled, with the wheel vibrating, you can almost feel a physical front tire fighting for grip.  Once the FFB feels good then the physics start feeling better too and I've thoroughly enjoyed a couple laps around the nordschliefe in the zonda R. Would definitely consider buying the full game if it comes up on sale.  So I'm changing this to a thumbs up.  If you'd like to know the tweaks I made, just google 'Jack spades FFB tweaker files' and you'll find the thread which gives all the instructions.Got halfway through the nordshliefe before I hit the exit button.  I have a T300 and the FFB is just horribly lifeless, what I mostly feel is center spring and virtually nothing else.  I lowered the gain so I know I'm not clipping.  There is a very detailed FFB settings section, but to be honest I'm not going to spend hours of my life experimenting to try and improve.  I really feel it should give adequate FFB out the box for a very mainstream wheel.Perhaps if I could feel the physics model had something to be excited about I might want to spend the time tweaking the FFB, but it just doesn't feel right to me, both understeer and oversteer are handled in a weird unrealistic way. Also the much vaunted graphics don't impress me very much, I much prefer the crispness of Rfactor2, Automobista and Iracing. (yeh I just said that!) If you want realistic handling, the sim that has impressed me the most is Automobilista. (which I base on real-life experience)			"

												Yes it's hard to learn. It's supposed to be. Yes, you need a wheel, keyboard or controller just doesn't cut it. Is it fun, yes. Don't like that you have to reset the contoller each time you boot it up. The full game remembers your setup. A very good way to get your feet wet in Project Cars, Try the Hauyra up the Azure Coast to get a feel for how good this game can be. Remember.. It's FREE!			"

												Excellent TECH DEMO. This is NOT a game, but a demo that you can dowload that will test your system to see if the game will run. For those who write bad reviews because you get bad framerates, the point of this is to see if your system can handle the actual game, and you're essentially complaining that a FREE test doesn't run even though this just kept you from spending money on a game that won't run on your rig...All in all, excellent demo. I highly recommend use of a controller as steering is tricky enough even with one. Very good representation of the actual game.			"

												Great little slash crying test for my rig. it runs not great but it runs, the pyshics feel wonky but that a lower framerate [sub-60fps] can contrbute to such. But it looks fantastic at its lowest settings in 720p, i refuse to go lower then that otherwise get it on console. Overall the cars looked great the tracks looked great. I didn't care for the a.i but its a good game. You NEED a rig with a decent amont of power for this game.			"

												This is one of the ultimate reality motorsport racing simulator game I've ever played in my entire life!The controls are a bit challenging that you might want to operate your cars manually, unlike other racing games. As for tracks, you might want to learn how to predict then to release gas, brake, and turn so that you can avoid accidents. For cars, coz' this is some sort of trial version of the game, so you can only use selected Pagani cars. Car choices is important. Like studying every cars' specs before you choose it for your sessions.This game might be difficult, but at least you have a patient to practicing your steering controls, brakes, gear shifting and  also, controlling your speed so you're facing some challenging races in the future shouldn't be any problem for you if you mastered it.""Practice makes Prefect""			"

												Im going to be honest here. I love racing games but what some people say about this game like the handleing is true. The handleing of the cars in this game is a little tricky. The cars are not like stiff, If turn by mistake you can mess up just like that. Graphic details for the cars are amazing. And performance is fine. Its good game u just need to get used to how it plays.			"
