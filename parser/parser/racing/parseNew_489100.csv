Looks good but need more development. Considering it's still in early access it may be a simple alternative for Wipeout series in the future. "

								Very cool game. You can choose between 4 gliders.Goal is it to reach a particular speed and avoid barricads to get to the boss an beat him.The game is still at the start so there is in the moment only 1 track but more will come.For me the game has very good potential. I'm excited how it will proceed.			"

								This game is super laggy, and I can't turn down the graphics because there are not settings at all, do not purchese this game if you don't have a super pc, (gaming pc).			"

								What can I say, quite a fun and enjoyable game. It looks great, the different ships are all beautifully designed. The world rankings are there to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off every single time I can't beat them. It put me right in that competitive mode...ready to beat anyone and have my name on top of all others. As an Early access game it's fantastic. Great job and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.			"
