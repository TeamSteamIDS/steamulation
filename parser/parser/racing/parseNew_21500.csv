												When I initially played it when I first got it, it didn't really seem like much to me. Then again, I was on a game sale binge at the time, and this caught my interest in the past. Playing much, much, later, I learned that it's actually an interesting trip-fest of a game. Once you get used to the controls, it's actually pretty fun. Sorta Wipeout-ish, considering the environments and combat-racer type of game that it is. Tracks are seemingly short, and in some tracks, you can't really tell where you're going until you crash into an invisible wall, and see a decent hint on the horizon where they had in mind for you to go to (turned too early a few times, and other times too late, or in the wrong direction, despite guidance arrows; some places are strange with their design). But once you get a good enough idea of how the game is, and the quirks of some of the tracks, it is a pretty fun game to race through once in awhile. Some parts kinda remind me of Star Wars Pod Racer; speeds of races included.			"

												As a fan of futuristic racers, this is one of the weaker iterations of that genre... The tracks themselves are very linear and don't have the same fluid speed and awesome backgrounds of similar entries. The combat / shooting mechanics feel particularly shoddy, with weapons being frantically-used and not very cool to look at when activated. The track designs generally consist of clumsily running into arches  which restrict your movement throughout the racing lane. Stray too far left or right and you come to an abrupt halt after running into some of the arches. To its credit, some of the ship designs are cool and the music is decent, but if you're looking for a fun futuristic racer, there are better options available. Save your money.			"

												Idk what all the bad rap about the rating of the game is being mixed, its a 5 dollar racing game that looks amazing. I didn't expect anything more for the price and I wasn't dissapointed.			"

												Once  you learn the courses, master the controls and work out the weapons this game is great fun looks good with interesting tracks it can be hard to see were your going at times but not if you play it in 3d  i use iz3d and it looks amazing as if it was made for it. It does get very hard later on but i cant stop trying to beat it.			"
