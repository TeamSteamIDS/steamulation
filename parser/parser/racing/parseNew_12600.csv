												Though it may have many flaws, it has alot to it. A wide variety of different customizations and a detailed performance menu. The handling is alright and the difficulty is challenging. Overall this game gets a good 7.5/10.			"

												I tried various fixes but the game simply crashes everytime I try to start the game. Luckily, by the looks of the reviews it's not a big loss and I can safely put this game into the 'hidden games' on Steam.			"

												well,for some reason,this game works for me on my AMD FX 8320 and my dying HD 7850.As for the game.You need to set all .exe files (yes this game has like 5 .exe files) to win 98 comp mode WITHOUT admin rights.I don't know how that works,but if you set it to run with admin rights,same crashes too.It's a pain to run on modern systems,but if you get it working,you have quite good racing game.Alot of bugs,for sure.On modern system sometimes the road starts to fade away,but can be fixed with extreme nitro.I'd give this game 10/10 because it has pimpin' rides and xzibit type of customization,and more story than The Last of Us.but,really,If the game works,I give it a 6/10 ok get it when it's like 99 cents.

												I forget where I bought the disc for this, but for whatever reason I remember that it actually ran on my (old) laptop.Surprisingly, it was a fun game I guess, a need for speed - esque game with some cool and detailed customization. The map was pretty nice too.However definitely don't buy it. Nothing about this game works properly and it can't be fixed. And nobody capable of fixing the problem cares enough about it's existence to do it for you.Some day I would like to see this game be playable, but it's probably never going to come.I spent all of 3 dollars on this at sale value and I wasted time just seeing if there was anything I could do. Valusoft doesn't care. And that's time I'm never getting back.If the game looks cool, it is to a degree. But it can't be played it. It's a universal issue with most of the people playing it, especially on new hardware.			"

												This game don't work on any of m PCs. I've tried on vista, win7 and win8, and it don't work on any off them. How old is this game? As it requires a 15 year old OS, maybe is it time to remove it from store and game bundles???			"

												I didn't play this game much, and that's partly becuase it feels really low budget-and not in a good way. It doesn't keep your attention that much.			"

												Game has this glitch where the road doesn't seem to load -- you can see on the radar where the road is supposed to be, but the game never seem to 'draw' it. I bought this game in a pack of old, abandonware type games, and wish now I had saved my money for games that still had a community and were ported/maintained better.			"
