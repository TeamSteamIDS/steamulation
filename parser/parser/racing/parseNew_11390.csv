												Buggy mess...but for 69p......bargin, i think the bugs are funny, nice car models and the game doesnt take it self too seriously, I laughed my balls off at the guy putting on the u.s. accent with the voice acting, Game is fun and thats what it aimed for and ive had plenty of laughs from it, you get a sense of speed, lots of cars i just dont get why someone would give this a thumbs down because its great, graphics are nice and it even runs on my crap laptop. Not sure about the price but on sale you def gotta pick this one up just to laugh at the bugs or the fact that you chase bad guys smashing up there cars as a policeman. Like i said, nice graphics, good sound, great fps and lots of cars, freeroam, slowmo crashes, missions and bugs... a steal if its on sale trust me.Overall 6.5/10.			"

												I just gave this game a try since it pretends to be an ""open-world driving game"", and that got me curious. Alas, after just over one hour of trying to come to grips with it, I have to admit I give up on it. It's not an awfully bad game, far from it. The graphics are more than decent, considering it's a game from 2009. On the highest settings (not that there are that many settings...), the cars look nice and the environment is more or less ok - bar the awful pop-ups in front of you of several objects. The driving model is fair, nothing special, but when played with a controller it feels fine. The music, as so often with this type of game, is all too repetitive for my taste so I switched it almost immediately off. There are some possibilities for adding your own music tracks to the game, so for those interested in this, the game offers something extra.The bad thing about the game is the ""gameplay"" - actually, there hardly is any, at least I did not find much of it. There are several modes: a free patrol mode, in which I searched in vain for anything to-do other than driving through a generic-looking city with roadsigns that kept saying ""Köln 2300m"" all the time. You can do a normal city race, which is fine for just a quick try, but the ""story mode"" is what lets the game down. The various objectives are simply hilariously difficult - most of the time one has to damage an opponent to 100%, but whenever he gets further away than 200m, the mission has to be restarted. Since the AI miraculously can teleport itself down bridges or through walls, this got me first staring in disbelief and then lauging out loud. I guess this game can be fun to some, but to me it's a no-go: there are simply too many other good games out there, including large-scale racing games, to put any more time into this.Overall score: 3.5/10			"

												""I don't have any argument but I don't like it !"" -Bad reviews from a random lowbob. 0/10""Like Skyrim with Polizei."" -IGN 2/10""Polizei, oktoberfest, ausfarht, dummkopfs."" -Medic 11/10So, first of all, this game doesn't deserve all those bad reviews. Everyone seems to have played this game for only 15 minutes, and honestly, you can't judge a game within 15 minutes. This game reviews are clearly manichaean ; you have two possibilities according to Steam reviews : you completly disregarded it because you played a few minutes and no minigun spawned on your car or you will find this game ""somewhat OK"". In my honest opinion, I really liked this game. Of course, there is tons of better game in that game style, like the FlatOut series, but this game got a decent amount of pros. Let me make a list of the pros, the cons and the neutrals.Pros :+ Graphism ; Considering it has been released in 2008-2009.+ Soundtrack ; Brutal and powerful, one of the best metal and hard rock soundtrack I listened in a videogame.+ Cars ; Despite the huge load of germans cars, you can still find a great american Dodge Ram SRT 10 called the Pick-up T2. ['Murica intensifies]+ Gameplay ; Easy, fast and fluid.+ Open World ; ""Like GTA, you know ?""+ Splitscreen ; 4 players Polizei-Ausfahrt-Party. + Race gamemod ; Chaos and destruction.+ Damage physics ; Pretty decent.Neutrals :~ Based on the German TV show Alert for Cobra 11 ; I don't have a strong opinion, some will say this is a great show.~ Storyline ; ""Chef : Cobra 11, I choose you !"" ""Semir&Ben : OMG God Bless Germany !"" ""Enemies : I am having a heart attack ! *die*"".~ Voice acting ; It's really bad, I admit but you need to consider the budget they got to do this game.Cons :- Lack of clarity and ingame messages ; This game isn't for the lazy ones, you need the ability to easily figure out what's going on and what's the objectives. The less ressourful people will dislike this game.- Bad staging ; Yes, considering there's no cutscene or models for the characters, they did what they could.- Advices ; They should show the utility of the Action key in some missions. Futhermore, when you choose a place to do your patrol, check if the car you chose got a red flag next to its name. It means, you have a mission to do, and this car is allowed.TL;DR, I really appreciate this game. However, don't think this game is incredible like a Grand Theft Auto. And please, if you buy it, don't be one of those bad players making bad reviews with only 15 minutes played.→ 80/100			"

But it's not the worst. It's not your average A++ racing game. It's mechanics and graphics are okay-ish, compared to other games.I'll be honest; I had fun. A few hours was enough for me to find some things to do (here's a screenshot of me doing something. It involves me running over and gathering NPC vehicles). I also enjoyed how you could actually (kind of) destroy things.Overall, it's a good game. Has free roam, places to explore, and things to destroy. I'd probably get it when it's cheap though (or in my case, when it's free).Unexpectedly had fun, 10/10 (for realism, of course).			"

												This is definitely not the best racing game out there, but I am not going to compare a game that I paid $1 for with $60 games. For $1, I got hours of action packed, intense races and chases. I have played the story for 16 hours and I'm not even done yet. The graphics are pretty good and the handling is realistic. The dialogues are cheesy and the missions are somewhat cliche, but don't let that stop you from buying this game.			"

												This game materialized in my library one day. I never purchased it, it was just there. I installed it out of boredom and expected the game to be no better than those ""X SIMULATOR"" games you see here on Steam. I was pleasantly mistaken, because this game, despite being made on an almost non-existent budget, is surprisingly solid. What the game lacks in originality, presentation, and innovation, it makes up for with solid controls, and really great vehicle physics. There's a fair amount of attention to detail here, too. Your car, and every other car in the game as well, can be absolutely smashed into an ugly mess, with way more convincing looking damage than what GTA IV and V have to offer. You can park in front of a train, let it smash your car's front grille in, go flying, land, and not be able to control your car at all because your front wheels are now several feet away racing eachother down the autobahn without you. The gameplay is pretty generic and repetitive, but still solid. You'll get bored eventually, but until then you'll have fun chasing criminals, smashing into everything, and racing. Traffic will move the ♥♥♥♥ out of your way when you turn on your sirens, and when you finally catch up to the bad guys and P.I.T. them into a wall, you'll have to hold them still there for a few seconds in order to ""arrest"" them. There's things to collect and vehicles to unlock, including an excavator and a massive armored personnel carrier with six wheels, which absolutely smashes everything out of its way including buses and large trucks, even in oncoming traffic. All of the cars are unlicensed rip-offs of real world vehicles, which I'm glad the developers managed to do. It's not a BMW, it's a Semir! They're different! We swear!All in all, it's a solid game. It's not the best game in the world, but it's definitely not bad either. It's just decent. A 5/10, or I guess 7.5/10 if you go by IGN's rating system. If you like racing and police chase games, and don't mind games with low budgets, pick this one up on sale.The developers of this game, sadly, stopped making video games in 2014. They were very well known in Germany, but virtually nobody knows about them outside of Germany. They specialized in racing games and their games were some of the best selling games to come out of Germany. Rest in peace Synetic, and if you guys are reading this, I loved World Racing 2 on the Xbox.			"

												This game is...this game...the mechanics of the driving and all are actually pretty enjoyable, and the graphics are pretty decent too. The UI and voice acting leave a little to be desired, but I can live with that. But the missions, the missions, the missions are just unredeemably awful. If this had just been a normal racing game, I would have liked it, but the attempt at open-worldiness is half-baked at best and doesn't improve the game whatsoever. The missions are so finnicky that it's very easy to instantly end up in a position where it becomes unbeatable, and with the complete lack of checkpoints this means you're going to be doing a lot of restarting, doing the same boring stuff over and over and over again. Staying at just the right distance from another car isn't fun, at least as implemented here. And after playing this game for an hour, I didn't get into a single race, which was what I was looking for in the first place. I feel like this game has the makings of a really great low-budget Burnout, but they instead went for some police angle that just doesn't work at all, either thematically or mechanically.			"

												Picked this up in a Steam sale long gone by and really didn't give this the time of day.  After TDU2 was in the mood for more mission base driving which CTII does quite nicely.  Nice graphics engine and alot of detail in the environment make CTII a pleasure to look at and at 60FPS.  Missions are limited to what you can do with a game like this. There are multiple difficulty levels.  It's been quite sometime but the game sort of reminds me of Wreckless, the mission based racer for the Xbox.  The primary career mode encompasses the exploits of 2 of Germanys finest though there is a Case structure for replayability and picking up past the 1st stage of a multiple stage Case, a welcome feature giving that I've played too many games that make you start from scratch.  There is a race mode where you can set up parameter based race events.  These include all of the vehicles in the game including semi's which no doubt leave a path of destruction.  A great value for the price paid and a fun game.			"

												I actually really loved this game. I bought it mainly because it was on offer but I'm having no regrets over it. It's fun and enjoyable and appeals to my need to drive a police car around pointlessly on blues. The voice overs aren't great but the storyline is pretty interesting. Up until I got stuck on a mission where you need to pointlessly jump onto a building roof to get to a helicopter that is pretty much impossible, I enjoyed it. There are some bugs and some vehicles will jump around like crazy making missions all that more difficult if not impossible. But overall, I loved the game and think that I'll probably end up spending many more hours playing it.			"

Crash Time II Review - Rating: 7.8/10General ImpressionCrash Time II is a pretty nice action-racing game. Do not trust the ""Mixed"" rating, the game is actually pretty good. The graphics and the textures are pretty nice and well-designed. Considering the fact that RTL Interactive had a small budget for this game, the graphics really are a pretty positive point for this game. The atmosphere happens in a fictional German city. The city is divided into several years, where you will have to patrol or to resolve cases, in function of the game mode you have chosen. The audio is pretty nice, I like the sounds of the vehicles. The music is decent, there isn’t anything special about it. The voice acting… is pretty terrible. It has been created superficially. The gameplay is relatively an open-world style, but the missions of it… they are boring sometimes, the developers didn’t concentrate on the gameplay very much. The story is also pretty uninteresting, 2 men have to complete the tasks given by the police. Nothing very special. The user interface is well-optimized, with no bugs and a pretty nice design. For less resourceful people, this game will be a pain: the user-interface has little information about the missions, therefore you need to figure out yourself, from the dialogues and from the environment circumstances. The controls are neat. The engines are alright, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. The mechanics are pretty sophisticated, everything around moves nicely, especially your cars’ movements/breaks/crashes. Overall, Crash Time II is a pretty nice action-racing game, with nice graphics, atmosphere and mechanics, which combines crashes and explosions with high speeds, but which needs improvement on the gameplay and on the voice acting.Positive PointsPretty nice and well-designed graphics and texturesPretty nice audio and pretty nice musicRelatively fun and challenging gameplayMany missions throughout the patrols & cases available 3 difficulties availableA pretty nice designed user interface, but it lacks of a lot of useful informationOpen-World gameplay alikeSome pretty stable enginesSome pretty nice mechanicsNeutral PointsSteam achievements and trading cards would improve the gameThe free-roam feature should be available from the beginning of the gameNegative PointsThis negative point is only available for people with less spirit of orientation: if you need tips, or exact locations where to start the mission, you will have a hard time with this game. The game should have had implemented a feature which enables or disables tipsIn my opinion, there are not enough race-type missionsThe voice acting is pretty terribleThe developers tried to make a pretty nice story, however it is not that kind of a good story, it is pretty uninteresting "

												Crash Time 2 is a series of games based on the German police drama ""Alarm for Cobra 11: Autobahn Police"". There was actually several games made under the Cobra 11 brand, then came Cobra 11 Nitro. However, none of these was exported. Next version, Cobra 11: Crash Time was exported  as ""Crash Time"", and that lead to the Crash Time II, and so on. (We're now up to Crash Time V). At its heart, Crash Time is an open-world mission-based driving sim with a fictional city for you to drive around in using variety of vehicles. CT2 has a good selection of German vehicles, none with actual names and logos, but they are readily recognizable, plus a few favorite foreign cars. The graphics are actually quite good, giving the amount of detail available for the cities and buildings. Some multilevel garages can be driven to the roof and back down via the spiral ramps. the Autobahns are nice and wide with plenty of places to speed, and many cars have nitrous injection added for that extra burst of power. The mission, on the other hand, are your typical police chase (either stop the car or crash him into toally disabled), checkpoint race (reach X checkpints, stop for 1 second in each), getaway (don't let the bad guys catch you), time trial (reach the destination via specified route before time runs out). CT2, however, added ""jumping puzzles"", where you must take the ramp at certain speeds to ensure you jump correctly onto certain locations in order to do something you can't do otherwise. And sometimes you need to chain the driving and jumping together, and that is just ridiculous. For example, one of the missions was ""stop that barge from dumping waste into the canal"" How do you do it? By taking ramps and JUMPING onto the barge (without falling into the canal, of course). That requires jumping across the canel, landing on the other side, make a left, jump ANOTHER ramp, then stop right on top of the barge (without falling off). All in... 45 seconds. ARGH! The city is large enough and open enough that ""free roam"" is quite possible Indeed, you are encouraged to ""patrol"" the city for missions to advance the campaign. Though in reality you just need to respawn at the regular start spots and few times, and/or scroll around the city map (fully zoomable in 3D!) for a ""red arrow"" which means mission starting point. Handling of the cars are simplified, and are exciting without being overly difficult. The campaign missions, however, have the dubious honor of having some of the WORST English dubbing done EVER in a game. The two voice actors are either very bored or acting too hard. Though this seem to reflect the type of TV show this was based on: more of action comedy than pure action. If you can find this game cheap, it is worth a try at least. It's not NFS: Hot Pursuit, but it has its own charms.  "

												Only having played 30 minutes in the game I'd like to say , well done. Well , you're a cop and try to take down assailants with your car in a high speed chase around the city. I dont remember how i got this game , but in no effect does it justify its store price. Only buy this if you're drunk or its free.The handling is actually better than need for speed rivals . Handbraking feels solid and destroying traffic lights and civilian cars opts in a title as collateral damage and adds up in euros. The game has 2 main protagonists. What's his name and his friend. They are cops and you , propably , are the one driving. Now, i did a mission where you had to stay for 5 seconds next to a truck and your passenger cop friend ""jumps"" on board it in order to take the wheel. After doing so , my cop car still had him as a passenger throughout the completion of the task. Now , when i noticed it , after a while ... i sighed. Not in dissapointment , but as in a weird feeling you have saying "" How did the developers miss that?"" You maybe are saying, this is a cheap♥♥♥♥♥old game. Sure, but it has actually VOICE ACTING. Yes , it does. And, you guessed right !  It is terrible.Anyway, like I said. Purchase when drunk.			"

												A really good case of 'Don't judge a game by it's looks'. This game may look low budget and it might be but I'd have to hand it to the devs for making such a great fun little game on a low budget. I've been looking for a good mission based racing game ever since I played The Simpsons: Hit & Run (Which I loved) and this really brought me back to when I first played it. It has some great missions ranging from escaping and smashing crooks of the road to high speed autobahn races. The graphics hold up very well for it's age and the open world is of a decent size. Cars handle great and there are plenty to unlock along the way. This was such a surprise since I got this for free and has definitely got me wanting Crash Time 3 here on steam. I hope the other games find their way onto steam someday too. 7.5/10			"

												If I had to compare Crash Time I would say a cross between Flatout and GTA driving controls. The driving scheme is interesting, and the damage portion is not as accurate or as hard hitting as Flatout, but does give satisfaction when you hit a car at a solid speed and the instant replay starts playing (one of the features of the game). The voice acting isn't as bad as everyone says (it's just the pauses between the voices that are weird). The gameplay itself is not bad. The game involves a lot of running around, doing missions, knocking these guys out while protecting these guys that sort of bit. Some missions are ridiculously hard and require a lot of replays (some missions can get meticulous). What's interesting is you can flick on your emergency lights, put on hazard lights, put on your turn signals - so if you like driving by the law in GTA this may be for you.Realistically speaking though the game provides its moments of fun and overall is playable and enjoyable. As for outstanding... not so much. It seems there are opportunities where it could have been, but it missed it's glory. For a game that I bought under two bucks... I think it's about worth it.You do get a decent game at least.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												Now this isn't the best racing simulator out there, but it's a great game to play when you have nothing to do or would like to pass time. I do admit the missions can become repetitive and the voice acting is far from great but the gameplay itself isn't half bad. I wouldn't buy this game at full price as it's not worth it at £6.99 as there are better games out there for the money. But, I managed to buy this game whilst it was on a discount so I'm not too fused about the price.Overall, this games suits certain people and their taste in racing games.			"

												It's a fun car game with great physics, whats more to say?More to sayThe voice acting is laughably bad, and the multiplayer is of infinite replay value. Don't buy it for the story, buy it for the free roam gameplay.			"

												I got it for free and thought the game had a rather broken mission system. I enjoyed the free roaming for some time, though.6/10			"

												So I got this game for free some website so giving it away, was sitting in my gameslist for like 2 months so I today installed it and this game turns out it really good, but I wouldn't pay the full  price, I would only buy this on a sale. This game is sort of based on a german cop show, well it has their characters in it and them voice acting and they're the main characters in the game. So its fun, Lots of missions, 4 Hours in and I still have not finished it and I've only been doing missions. The game has weird controls but when you get used to them they're fine. Urm... Pros: Fun.Long story.Funny-ish diaglog.Cons:Non-licsened cars. pretty dispointing for a car game.Controls - Really Hard to get use to.Missions. - Because the missions work on a basist that you ethier drive to them or get them on the radio, but only certain vechiles can get them at a time, and sometimes you have to go look for the missions which the game didn't really explain.Tortuial - (Or however you spell it) Its very trickly because you mess up you have to restart a big chunck of it, same with the missions.Overall rating. 6/10 Buy Or Not Buy : Buy on sale.

Product received for free
												I don't know why...But I really enjoy the game. I like the open world, the (really) huge number of cars (and some other vehicles; e.g. a cart or a forklift), the okay graphics and damage models as well as the property damage counter of course ;)The story is okay, and even after the story you still have stuff to do as the parts of a cool vehicle are spread over the whole map to find, finding all of them will unlock it.You can pick the game up for about a buck since there was a giveaway for it; I received the Steam key for the game there, so I mark this as a product I got for free, but I actually played the game on CD-ROM before owning it on Steam - So my playtime is definitly more in reality.

												Crash Time 2 is a very enjoyable game. It's not without bugs, but I think the experience is certainly fun enough to warrant fighting through those.Visually, it's fantastic, and I had no framerate issues at all running with max graphics on my GTX760 (1680x1050 fullscreen). The cars have great damage models—you can literally knock the wheels off your car, and you will actually feel it. Knock off both your front wheels, and you can't steer anymore and must reset your car. I really liked that touch.The missions are fun and varied. Even if you do similar things in some missions, they tweak the mechanics enough that you never feel like it's completely monotonous. Driving the RC cars (bomb detonators) is particularly fun.The world is HUGE, and it's a lot of fun to explore. Granted, there aren't really ""side missions"", but it's fun to just drive around nonetheless. There were quite a few moments where I went off drops at max speed, and it gave me a real sense of adrenaline flying through the air (fortunately no one was around to mock me shouting, ""Woah!!"")The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, but it won't win any awards. The same is true for the voice acting. For a racing game, it's probably slightly above par.A good selection of cars are available, and you can pick and choose the cars you use for some missions (though certain missions can only be performed with certain cars). They have completely different feels to them, but for the most part, you're going to want to stick with the faster vehicles for most missions.I paid $0.99 for the game, and I would honestly have been happy paying $5 for it. I definitely recommend it.The downsides to this game are the bugs, and here those are (with recommended workarounds if available):- On ""wreck the car"" missions, if you flip the opponent's car over, the car disappears and respawns somewhere near you (the same thing that your car would do if it got stuck upside down). If the opponent's car happens to respawn behind you, that means it will likely turn around and drive the other way. I recommend doing your best to not flip over the cars or completely pin them where they can't move. Just keep hitting them with force or get them behind you then keep bumping them as they try to pass you.- Sometimes, it's just plain hard to find a mission. You drive around for a while and nothing appears. In these cases, try switching cars (look for ones with mission indicators), and try switching starting locations. You shouldn't ever need to be driving around for more than a minute for the mission brief to play, so keep moving about until a mission appears. Annoying, but workable.- The navigation arrow is absolutely useless sometimes. It will recommend jumps over bridges when your car isn't fast enough to make the jump. Fortunately, the mini-map has a much better direction indicator that adjusts for different routes and recommends shortcuts. I highly recommend using that primarily (even though you have to look off the screen a bit).			"

												I crashed into a train at around 200MPH. Left almost no damage on my car.10/10 - Would try to commit suicide again.--But seriously, this game is not that bad. It's not a GOOD game, but it'll make you laugh! I gurantee it.The graphics for a 2009 game are actually pretty decent, the voice acting is so cheesy you'll either love it or hate it.The music and sound effects are decent. It's an overall all DECENT game.(I got it for free, so I can't really complain either.)			"

												This is a great game although glitchy I have completed this game once and on my second play through mow it's really fun and the glitchs can be funny or very annoying it is open world and very ""if you want to put you're car somewhere you put it there"" handling model the open world is quite detailed but not tdu2 detailed but still detailed and there are a bunch of unlicensed cars and their extremely close to their real life counter parts the missions are chores though so the most amount of you will have the most fun messing around.
