												OK this is a serious reviewI've been a hk talesrunner player since 2007This game's design is really good, a fun running gameBut later on you'll find out this is actually a pay-to-win gameMost strong armor or shoes that boost your stats actually cost real moneyThis game is not really free-to-play...You can give a try, but when you meet some strong players you will want to pay for stats just to beat other playersNot really recommend, but it's definitely a fun game			"

WARNING, LONG REVIEW AHEAD. SCROLL DOWN FOR TL;DRTales Runner isn't what it used to be.Do not let the low game time fool you about this review. I only did this so I could write this. I have played Tales Runner since 2008-09 when it was hosted by GPotato, and have been a major fan of the game ever since. The cartoony graphics, quirky maps, and interesting characters are what kept me playing the game for so long. I was playing the game before alchemy was even released, and the most you could get on your stats were about +1 or +2 on specific stats with some items. All I did was play as Charlie (Now named Billy), and I had tons of fun playing with almost anybody no matter what level. Once alchemy was released, that was a completely different story, and everybody had to get their hands on them because it was an interesting concept that made Tales Runner an MMO. At first, it was just something fun to get bonus stats so that you can become stronger as long as you kept your alchemy repaired. Skip ahead two or three years.Gpotato then turned Tales Runner into a pay2win game. With all new pets, the grand Piero alchemy set that all pros including myself needed to get, and trees to put in your farm to get tons of EXP for so that you can level up, Tales Runner started making its downward slope into destroying itself. Finally, Gpotato released the biggest content patch that many users had been waiting so long for... Chaos War. All new Angel and Devil sets were released, multiple Legendary Fire equips (That only came in different colors but came in the near same stats, but required TONS of farming for in game money to claim in their gambling system.) Chaos War brought along new content like turf wars, and chaos maps (Basically maps where you join together with different people to defeat a specific boss.) Everybody only did Guardian Training (Hard) because it was a simple, easy boss that anybody with good amount of skills could do in under 2 minutes to get MASSIVE amounts of EXP and TR. This is where the fun started getting sucked out of the game. That's all people did, as well as The Angry Brother map (Another easy map for those that are skilled that you can finish in only 30 seconds to get tons of EXP.) Now, there are two types of players in Tales Runner: Those that played for fun, and those that played to become the best. I fell under those that only played for fun after I realized that they were taking a game like this so seriously. I had all alchemy upgraded to their final level, most of them Rank S for the best stats that could come on them, every single character, and the skills to back up those items.I even joined in most events that the GMs hosted to get the players to participate in to win for prizes. I won a Tales Runner t-shirt from the Battle Channel that I still keep in my closet as a keepsake, and almost won an Xbox 360. The GMs, specifically Yuui were really some great, friendly people that knew how to do their job correctly. And that was pretty amazing for a game brought over from Korea to the US. Shortly after the release of Kuro, Tales Runner became rather...empty. Before, I used to be able to find a Lizard Crisis (Hard) or Angry Lizard (Hard) room to play in with a full 30 people. Now it was just Brazillians (Not trying to be rude here) that spent tons of money on the game to get the best alchemy, pets, etc, while doing The Angry Brother to get high up in the level rankings, and the usual other high level players spamming Guardian Training (Hard) for more EXP. Gpotato then decided that they needed to shut down the server. Perhaps it was because they already peaked a few years before, or they just weren't having enough people play on their server. I was not too sure. I was devestated that they had shut down a game that was so close to my heart, that I had so many friends on. Luckily, Gpotato left the forums up for a few months after the shut down, and I got a bunch of my old friend's contact information to keep in touch with them, which I still talk to today. I've played on the Korean and Thailand Tales Runner server, though mostly the Korean one, and I can see the clear difference of what makes them differ from Gpotato's and OGplanet's version. They have players that actually play for FUN. This game was originally created to be played for fun with others, even if there was a sense of competition thrown in. I've had tons of laughs for the many years that I've played with on Gpotato's Tales Runner, and the memories will never die out. To keep a hold of those memories, I've played on some of the private servers that Tales Runner veterans have made, like Atomix Tales Runner and Aeon Tales Runner; both of which are shut down now due to money/server hosting issues. When word got to me about the opening of a new, official US Tales Runner server, I jumped onto it as soon as possible, only to realize I was playing a piece of crap disguised as a brick of gold. The game will never be like how it used to be, and it is not even worth to me to start over from the very beginning to try and work my way up the rankings and get all my old alchemy and pets.__________________________________________What OGplanet is TRYING to do with Tales Runner nowEver since with the release on Steam, it seems like OGplanet is trying to reach out to new players in an attempt to bring Tales Runner back into full swing to the way it used to be. But now, since the Korean server is far, far, FAR ahead of the US server now, and the previous US server had so many updates into it, OGplanet is able to implement new content into the game really, really quickly, and have advanced much farther than what Gpotato Tales Runner used to be. Now, some people may think that OG Tales Runner isn't pay2win. Let me shine the light on a few things that clearly make it that way. 1. Buying Astros to buy TR so that you can buy characters and upgrade alchemy faster than having farmed the TR.2. Buying 'candy' to speed up your marriage days so that you can get to the last ranking ring much faster than having done it normally. (Before you had to be with a couple for a whole 365 days in order to get the ring.)3. There is still the aspect of using Astros to easily get the top gear in the game, excluding Legendary Fire gear. (Now unless you're a retard, all you will get is the Black Piero Set and not the Elite Piero Set, unless you want to look really fancy.) This costs roughly 2064 Astros, or $100.You can easily spend money in this game to get what you want, even if it comes down to a matter of skill, which some people forget. I've played with a default ""Billy"" for quite some time now, and I am still able to easily beat people that have fully geared main meta characters like ""Troy"", ""Lily"" and Kai. That says something to me, and shows that people are just buying their way to a sad attempt at victory, rather than playing the game and getting the experience needed to actually get better and enjoy the game. Rather than farming for alchemy cards and TR, people would rather buy their shortcuts, which personally is not my problem, because people are allowed to spend their money the way they want to. I have no say in how others spend their money. So OGplanet is basically reaching out to new players to get more p2w players than they already have in hopes to make even more money to pay for their terrible, laggy servers.All I can say now is, R.I.P. Tales Runner. Thanks for all the good times, and friends that I've made on the old Gpotato server. tl;dr - The game is pay2win, and is not like how it used to be. Only play it if you're incredibly bored and have nothing else to do.And these new names for the characters are absolutely terrible. OGplanet, just give it up.			"

												Note:I would like to make it clear that I played the original tales runner when it was a gpotato game, religiously.I'm running this game on a 955 black edition quad core AMD 3.0 processor with a HD 6970 2gig dual graphics card.Gameplay: Same type of spam ctrl to fall faster, z to dash, shift to use items as the old TR, which isn't bad.Items you use in game gets ridiculous, because you move 5 inches and get blasted multiple times. They need to have less ""Drop you where you stand"" items and more ""speed-me-up"" items, or at least a baseball mitt that catches other players items incoming.Gameplay is now laggy and doesn't seem to be very optimized, even when going into the settings and playing around.Their game guard desperately needs updated, as you will understand later in my review.The Shop:As compared to 4 main characters to choose from in the GPotato version, (Apollo, DND, Ming Ming, Charlie), This version only offers the Ming Ming and Billy alternatives. They do offer 3 different starting outfits, which is nice, but does not make up for the lack of characters to begin with. Every other character you have to buy with Astros. Things that used to be free to get with TR cash in GPotato's version, are now ""buy to buff"" and offer sometimes overpowered stats that are applied upon equipping. Items you used to be able to buy permanently are now ""Pay 30k to have this for 30 days, and then you have to do it again!"" Which, to put it lightly, sucks.Graphics:Graphically, the cartoon-like style isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it could really use updated.Upon setting all of the graphics to max, the game wasn't really changed much; Which is slightly dissapointing.The In-Game Community:The community of this game used to be friendly and open, and now it's full of people who won't even say ""Hi"" or reply when you ask a question. I encountered multiple hackers in each game I joined, who finished the race in 10 seconds and never moved from the starting line, people who dashed infinitely, and people who were not affected by running through hurdles or getting hit by items.Final Verdict:I can look past the slightly outdated graphics, but the community, hackers, and the lack of optimization takes this game from an 8.5 to a 4.5 out of 10.I loved Tales Runner from GPotato, but this falls FAR behind. They took an amazing game and made it pay to win.Needless to say, Unless GPotato takes Tales Runner back over, I will not be playing it again.			"

												I feel like everyone is missing the point of reviewing a game. People aren't recommending it basically because it isn't how it used to beThe game is still fun though it is one of the most unique video games in the entire world there is truly nothing like it. I feel like everyone is forgetting that...Seriously the level design is amazing and interesting with a lot of good music, there are a lot of fun game modes to choose from, and then once you get skilled it becomes even more interesting. I sat down addicted to playing for like 4 hours when I got back into the game and just had a lot of fun people weren't even really talking for the most part but just the joy of racing through these crazy levels is amazing. That is why I highly recommend anyone to try this game.			"

												PAY 2 WIN AND BUGGED AS HELL!I need to pay 10€ for strongest characters!* I can't put my name for finish the tutorial!**This was my review yesterday. Two developers had commented on my review, so i deleted the review and I tried again.*This is just the truth. All characters and items with better statistics are shoppable. All F2P have microtransactions, when they go to improve aspects, pets etc. are really F2P. When you can start and be already very strong and you can buy things that improve the statistics become P2W, so don't come to talk about microtransactions.**I tried all possible combinations as suggested, I tried any combination for non-US keyboards, and still doesn't work.

												An honest, straight forward review for the people that show actual interest in what this is all about.I used to play this little game, back when I was quite young and it was hosted by a service called Gpotato.This game is a simple racing game with a fantasy twist and it's charming. You only have to use 3 buttons and the arrow keys (Yes, that old).You play on different maps, usually children book tale - themed , in different modes, 8 players, 20 players, boss battles, survival maps and relay and so on. There is also your own room space- your farm and community hub - the plaza.This is a great competitive game, quirky and fun. You can either enjoy it lightly, spend the money or not as it uses a cash shop, like any other F2P. You can use variety of cosmetic items, stat helping items, etc. For in game money or real money, or surveys for ""game cash"".You can also become one of those people that take it seriously and climb the leaderboard ladder while you grind supportive items, if you choose so.This game can be enjoyed by all ages, however I would be aware some of the players may say inappropriate things, but the filter system works just fine :)Played as 14 year old and 21 year old and still enjoying it as much. A must-try-out!			"

												This is coming from someone who doesn't think winning is everything. I played this game since it first appeared on Gpotato all those years ago and then WinnerHub. Firstly this is not PAY-2-WIN as many think.Firstly, yes alot of items are real-money, however you have daily missions and some little events in the park to get timed cash items, some are not timed however which is good. It is not heavily stacked against you. A lot of the cash items you don't even need to enjoy the game or play it. Only 1 or two for the event maps but that is for the hardest stage, you can play the normal and easy stage for free and if you befriend someone who can get into the paid-rooms, they can invite you! So don't feel like you will never get into them.However, because many players are in the Event/Co-op maps (read below) you won't really need stats because they cannot push you around or hurt you with their fury! so really stats are only needed if you play the single-races which can be hard to get people for.Pros:- Daily racing missions for items with stats/bonuses- TR is easy to get- Characters are cheaper then they once were- Leveling is easy- Can have items on as a costume (no effects) with effecting clothing underneithCon:- Some items are confusing on what they do- Hardly any item rooms- People hang in Event Map/Pro channel- Card hunting is more of a pain here- Server seems kinda emptishNow, people will mostly be in the event channel this is bad and good. Bad because it can get boring but also the fact you be having trouble finding people for maps you want to play. A lot of maps are ignored sadly.It is good however because people will not see your level and kick you, unlike other modes where they will judge you unless you are Sandel+ (The Main Quests should get you up to sock+)However this is bad for true new players. On the event map you need to live to get rewards at the end but you could always hang back and get the exp/money off the floor. If you don't know how to dash-jump however you will have problems.The server has died from when I first saw it but I don't mind. Plenty of people to find and play with and a lot of high levels are not judgemental as others think they are or want you to believe. At sock level, a high ranker was happy to race with me and even give me a chance to show him I could do the co-op maps  just as good as they could. Because the server is not massive as it used to be I am seeing these people more often and having a great time with them. I not came across anyone yet who asked the host to kick me because of my low level compared to theirs, infact many stuck up for me. I say give this game a go but I would research how to Dash-Jump first because you will need it to keep up with the players as many are returning players from the other versions that were shut down. Otherwise the community is lovely as far as I have seen  and actually the nicest one I have found in years in the Tales Runner gaming community.			"

I hope you enjoy playing as a little boy or little girl.Because that's the only two character choices you have. They show every character in the game, and only two are selectable. Not much has changed from the last time I played this. It's still pay to win. The Graphics, while dated, are acceptable. Everything is cute, and has a charm to it. The controls are still werid if your use to WASD, and take some time to get use to. I'd recomend this to younger kids, thinking maybe they enjoy it. However for the Steam Userbase, your time (and money) would be better suited elsewere.. Which is a shame because they're are not a lot of racing platfomer games out there.			"

												I'm trying to really, really like this game... But for some reasons, I can't.There's some good idea and all, but they are all badly executed. The camera is really counterproductive, jumping is awkward, most mechanics involves pressing repeatedly on the same button.Controls are way too clunky, hitboxes are the worst, there's a bug RIGHT WHEN creating a character, pretty much everyone can't type. It's there since launch or something like that. (Launch on OGPlanet at least, I don't know the one before)Right when doing quests, you get your inventory full of clothes. I mean, that would be nice if your clothes weren't the type to expire. The countdown starts right when you get them, which isn't fun.If you're trying to start, good luck, everyone plays on expert.You're frequently wondering what you have to do, which isn't a good thing for a racing game.Musics are boring, characters voices and sound effect makes me want to punch my speakers, and the game sometimes makes me want to smash my keyboard.At least this game doesn't shove you in the face the option to buy things with real money.

												Revisited this game because of nostalgia, things are different from way back, which isn't a bad thing.There are new characters to try, right from the get go you can choose to be one of the 'cool characters' from way back (like Rough, now named Troy). You can keep up with all the 'pro' players of this game if you master the jumping dash (and there's a guide up on how to do it)There are items to grind for better stats and such, items to buy with real money too, but the game is still fun to play.I'm addicted to it again...

												TalesRunner is a game where you race through fairy tales for the one wish if they win which never happens to keep the game going,you can race friends or team up you can pay to play and spend money or play with working for your slice of talesrunner paying is alot easier but besides you can also fight boss's and its a creative fun game that will keep you glued for hours                                                                                                                                                                                                   P.S And community isnt the best			"

												well the controls are a bit odd you have to hit F12 to continue which steam will take a picture everytime. I did like the style. Interesting the character you select the costume which does not appear in game when you start. Worst part about the game is that no one plays it so other than some basic challenges there is nothing else to do. I think this game may have come here to die.			"

												As a casual Tales Runner player for the last seven years I wanted to give an actual review for this game of which most of the other steam reviews are not.Tl;dr: Overall Tales Runner is a very fun game that offers a large amount content for players to enjoy.  It is a game that rewards skill much more than having the best gear. It can be played either hardcore or casually and its microtransactions only offer convenience.The ReviewTales Runner is primarily a social game. It is a very difficult game to enjoy if you are looking for a single player experience as the game revolves around racing with and against other players. It is also a game that can be played and enjoyed casually due to the lack of a need to maintain gear in order to win races.The game was originally released in 2005 on its native Korean server and as such has relatively dated graphics when compared to more modern games. The graphics with its anime inspired design, however, has allowed the game to age much better than many of its contemporaries. The game, unfortunately, only supports a 800/600 resolution so if it is not played in windows mode the graphics may be stretched and distorted. I personally would recommend playing in windowed mode as the difference in overal graphic quality is significant.The game features numerous maps to race in and is adding more with every patch. As such there is enough content that it is rather difficult to become bored with the game. Certain maps, however, are preferred by the community much more than others as such certain maps are nearly completely unplayed such as the animal racing and 20 player co-op maps. There are farms which function like your standard mmo housing system, and a park that features various minigames and offers a place to socialize with other players. There are also various missions for those who are looking to challenge themselves or prove their skills.Despite what many of the other reviews may say the game is not pay-to-win. All characters and most items are available for purchase using ingame currency that is earned by playing the game. Those items that are only available as microtransactions only offer convienence that may lessen the grind for the ingame currency and experience. There is no gear that is only available for purchase though microtransactions that provides a large enough advantage over the free options for the game to be considered pay-to-win. Despite that I must say that the early grind for in-game currency and alchemy cards is immense but if you are patient and invest in gear that boost your earnings per race the grind diminishes greatly. It should be noted, however, that if a player wants to maintain a large amount of gear without spending money on microtransactions the grind will will be significant and potentially overbearing. Though if a player is willing to spend money to maintain their gear only about $5 a month is necessary which is less than many subscription based MMOs. Finally, having good gear is completely unnecessary to enjoy the game or to be able to win races. A player's skill is a more important contributor to winning races than having the best gear. The game has daily events that offer players a chance to obtain those items that are only available for real-world currency for free. These daily events function much like a lottery except that there are daily play-time requisites that helps to reduce the number of entries and improves your chance of winning those.Currently the game is having problems with server stability due to recent DDOS attacks. While overall disconnections are infrequent, there are periods of frequent disconnections that can become an inconvenience. Based upon former server performance I expect this issue to be fully addressed soon. Somewhat related to this, the customer service for this game is rather slow and I hope this will be improved in the future.The community is average. There are those who are completely unenjoyable to be around and those who are eager to accept and help a new player. Depending on the game mode (mostly cooperative maps) it is likely to be frequently kicked from a room if you are low leveled. This is by far probably the worst aspect of the community for the new player experience. Other issues with the community involve those who are fequently looking to cause player-player drama but they can be easily avoided.Overall Tales Runner is a very fun game that offers a large amount content for players to enjoy.  It is a game that rewards skill much more than having the best gear. It can be played either hardcore or casually and its microtransactions only offer convenience.			"

												I disagree with most negative comments other reviewers say about this game. It's true that using money to purchase in-game outfits, pets, items etc will give you an advantage but not necessarily help you win the game. Coming down to it, skills play a rather important part in this game.Following on, learning your basic maneuvering, jumping, double jumping, DJ, Dash Jumping will essentially help you win regardless of the items other players have. Also, every game has its typical new players, average and veteran players. There will always be winning and losing, blaming others for paying to play won't make you any better. Last but not least, the graphics and quality of this game isn't bad at all. I reckon its much better than half the games there are out there. In the end, i'm gonna say that I do reccommend this game out. Nothing will be justified unless you give it a try yourself. So good luck, have fun (:			"

												This is my first review so bare with meI played Talesrunner (TR) since it was hosted back on Gpotato. I spent countless hours playing on the weekends when I was younger. Then TR shutdown on December 21 2011. That was the golden era.TR right now is in a bad state.The community is a mix bag. It's a small community. Good hearted players that want to have fun are the minority. I run into elitist and hackers that make this game unenjoyable. on top of that this is a very niche game. TR has a hard time welcoming new playersThis game is sadly play to win if you played competitively. There is a lot of gear that boost your stats. you can get items using in-game money but the grind is not worth it. if you want to look good you have to pay for it.I got DoS from a player of this game. not fun.This game is not what it used to be.

												Hell itself just threw up, and I'm the janitor.Just remember this monstrosity is real, if you can believe that.I get thrown in a menu with no rhyme or reason that looks like one of those fake malware sites, I couldn't tell if half the things were scam adverts or menu elements. I thought to myself ""what the ♥♥♥♥ did I do to get here?""Well, I was told to create a character, by create I mean ""pick one of these 4 people, no customisation."" I just went with the one that didn't look like some edgy 13 year old or salty 6 year old. Then some dude just got his history all wrong and failed to make humour, possibly, it was nonsense to me because I didn't do my research on everything in this game before I played it, because you know, you must know 100% of the game's plot before you play it...Now i'm asked to name myself, but litterally nothing works, either this game has a ♥♥♥♥ing huge community or there's a problem in the code, the only name not ""unavaliable"" was ""KVELDIC"". Even every variant of C.Sandwich, Kaptain Skurvy, Klump and VBDIVBEVRB was taken? Then I'm told to move, as usual for a game, then jump as expected. This is where things really hit the floor, my character sounded like Big the Cat with Cystic Fibrosis and Chronic Lung Cancer. I then used the menu to mute the audio, I never saw that room or those card demons ever again, and I don't want to, I'm scared. After staring at some popups for a good five minutes, I think I get offered a quest or something and I figure out the gameplay...It's a clone of the Zoo Race!What horror thought the Zoo Race was good enough to warrant a game based on it? It's the same religion errors (noah throwing explosive barrels at animals that were people instead of building an ark) with the same idea (go from A to B as fast as possible ""against"" other ""people"" with confusing as hell track layouts and (probably, I muted the audio) garbage midi playing in the background. The only difference is that it is slower and has LESS depth, is that even possible? At least the Zoo Race came with a cutscene showing you the somewhat questionable story, here there's nothing like that!I think I did the first quest, all I did was press 2 buttons so I think I did it before being thrown into the menu again. So I move onto my next quest and pray to GabeN that the Zoo Race thing was a one-off.Nope, I apparetly have to do something to do with Mary and baby Jesus.I officialy quit reviewing free steam games, the Playstation 1's bad side is better than this, and I'm talking about Bubsy 3D and the like.Peace out, Mothra-lovers, PC master race my ♥♥♥♥.""TL;DR: eat ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" - Dr. Andonuts / Toby ""Radiation"" Fox.

												Played for a few years. 90% Skill Based 10% items/stats (Lvl 1s with nothing can beat lvl 80s with everything and DO freqently). Very Fun. It's a good mmo to play for a month or two and then go on hiatus from (Good players always come back eventually). Talesrunner is a unique, DIFFICULT, fun, but old  foot racing game enjoyed on servers around the world. NOTE: There was an old US server on gpotato that died many years ago, some players have played the game since then on other servers. Also it can be a very amusing social experience where many players share accounts, because they've logged 1000s-10,000s of hours on the game and trust each other completely. Not many games other than WOW and Runescape can accomplish feats like that.Warning: This game is a racing game at it's core with a HIGH difficulty curve. You WILL be terrible compared to good players for MONTHS, even if you have BETTER equips than them, if you do not learn the tricks to going faster, like dash jumping, and don't route out the maps/look at videos of routes. 2nd Warning: The point of this game is to try and get good times on maps and win races. That means that the equips in the game are not important to skilled players unless they're competing with other highly skilled players. I say this because some new players believe this is Pay to Win just because it takes a LONG time to get a lot of good equipment when lvl 1 players can buy many of the good equips with money (not ALL). Yes, it takes a long time to buy equipment and there are some things that can only be bought with real money, like pet resources. HOWEVER, it takes long because it wants you to master that 90% skill part before getting the 10% equips part and because there would not be much else to do. ALSO, the in game real money currency, called Astros, is frequently and easily obtained by trading for the normal in game money you can earn and is NOT against the rules to do so.TL;DR: Try it for a couple days, if you didn't quit already then look up some tutorial videos on youtube or something and set yourself in for the long haul for a game you will never quit forever. (Recommend looking up Dash Jump Tutorial videos and buying 2 new characters, Troy and Kai preferably, before spending in game money on anything else).			"

												Game is not P2WThis game isn't as Pay 2 Win as you all may think. The only P2W aspect of this game are as follows: Magical/Golden Hammers (Repairs Alchemy), a few TIMED sets via boxes in shop, the couple system (Still free until level 4), and majority of the pet items (Pet food and upgrades). Even so, there are still Wooden Hammers and Alchemy Pet Food that you can create by non-real-money-spending meansThe Alchemy shop allows you to craft powerful items that will increase your stats while you wear it, and all of these sets are gained through TR (IG Currency) and specific cards that drop in specific maps. It's very grind heavy, but in most cases all the alchemy that people have is through hard work and time. All the characters and most pets costs TR rather than Astros, the special sets you get from boxes in the shop can easily be countered with stronger alchemy, it's just the matter of putting in the work. Yes, people can buy Alchemy with Astros, however it extremely expensive and close to no one actual does it, so there is no real advantage. The publishers and CAs are doing their best to make game experience better than it already is, and continue to add exclusive events and event prizes to better benefit all players.Review the whole game, and try going after some alchemy before making claims like this. It's a very competitive game, and regardless of that it's extremely balanced compared to how it was before, so give it another try. As for the ""rankists"" , this is normal in any competitive game, if you need help, all new players are free to message me, or any of the other CAs for help.IGN: [CA]JaykeKnown Issues:Can't type your IGN?: http://nforum.ogplanet.com/tr/forum_posts.asp?TID=611126&PN=10 TR and EXP?: http://nforum.ogplanet.com/tr/forum_posts.asp?TID=619900 "

												Easy way to explain the problem with this game. There is a sing on the ground in the game world that points to the minigame area, and that sign has a picture of a controller on it. You see the problem is that there is 0 Zero 0 100% none controller support for this game.In a runner that would not be so bad, but every time a message window pops up you need to either click it off, or hit enter. While you have your right hand fingers on the arrow keys, and left on the control, shift, and Z keys, and are in the middle of running you then have to hit enter, but this stops your run. This should just be clearable with control, or even space.Tell the makers of this game to send me an email if they ever make it work.			"

												I used the play Tales Runner quite a lot in my younger years!This game barely scrapes onto the side of 'pay-to-win', I say barely because it's still quite easy to beat someone with 'p2w' items if you enjoy the game.Tales Runner is something different in the MMO crowd, a lot more leasurly, this is why I enjoy it. If you're really concerned about the p2w items though, but still want to try it out, do the tutorial quests, it unlocks some temporary stat boosting items for you to even out the playing field a little more.This game is definetly not for everyone, and in my honest opinion 'p2w' is a gradient and this scores pretty low on said gradient. But it is defiently a dated game and the interface is a bit confronting at first, this game will defiently not appeal to you if you're looking for something serious to bite into.			"

Dunno what all the negative reviews are about, its a pretty fair game. Yes if u pay real money u will have an advantage, and the game didn't work right away. The controls took me about an hour to get used to, but once this was achieved it was fun to play. Not many games out there that look like this, its original in its being and worth a try.			"

												This game is fun but, its Pay2win and requires too much grinding to get anything.The maps are really fun to play, 30 man mode survival maps are really fun but sort of challenging.Co-op mode got boring for me quick, I only play it once in a while or when I need TR.Also I wish you could use your Ogplanet account through steam.

												I hate this game.The art style is very cute and some of the tracks are very imaginative and creative. The game is very unfair to new players as many of the better players are straight up faster due to there items. There are a lot of mean people that kick you for no reason. The game is so judgemental and people judge you on your appearance. It is a big grind to get all the cool things which is not worth it. The rental system is the worse, any rental system in any free to play game is terrible. While the core gameplay is quite fun it is overshadow by the toxic community, the vanity of others and the pursuit of level grinding. The game encourages grinding rather then racing for fun. I hate this game. Uninstalled!			"

												It requires a DRM that takes a ridiculously long and tedious process to activate. After you donload the game on Steam, you have to download lots of additional stuff with the third party and the process takes a lot of ressources from your computer. When it was finally ready to start, after a vid, you get to choose a character, then you are asked to input a name, that is when I found my keyboard input systematically blocked. I de-installed, and re-installed the game, but the same thing happened no matter what I did with my computer. So I bought a game, but I never could launch it, so I don't even know it is about.			"

												This game is very fun but at the same time, its pretty dissapointing to some people. The reason is ""Pay2Win"".I can't imagine how people would spend so much money on this game. I've seen many reviews of why its bad, so I tried it out for myself. Turns out, the beginning is not so bad, but to choose a character? There's 4 main characters and you can only choose one, In the reviews I've seen the 4 was free. I really don't know how they changed the game completely out of its core. For my opinion this has alot of things to fix espically the main reason I'm writing this ""Pay2win"". It's a great game with its racing?Also what I've seen in the reviews is OG planet is a virus? I don't think it was before, Please tell me if I am wrong or right. Just making sure. OG Planet ruined all of its great gaming systems and all the fun of it, can I even continue for OG Planet? _________This game was first made by Gpotato, Tales Runner was a pretty good game considering the people who played it. It wasn't really Pay2Win, It was just fun and a nice game. GPotato has really outdone themselves with this game, it was amazing with how maps were. Just when GPotato had to shut down because...I don't know the reason but they shut it down.__________So OG Planet took the game. They ruined everything to making it Pay2Win, I swear they were desperate. OG Planet destroyed all the fun and free things in the game. It was probably because of the Alchemy that happened to be ruining everything back in the 2000's. OG Planet just literally made it worse, Bad mouth people came in to be insulting the people. Gears are now needed to pay and very expensive as I can say. See why I just don't want to even download this game anymore? Problems have been occuring in this game.Lets talk about the Gears ~ _______________________The Gears were probably the main part in this game to win a race. Powerful things to help you and boosts. Since now, the equipment and boosts are a complete disaster of how expensive they are! Even for characters, you gotta pay alot.

												This game is a lot of fun, but the creators shouldn't make it so easy for someone to be kicked out of a session. It was hard for me to actually play since other players kept kicking me out because I was new to the game. It is too easy for someone to be kicked out, and I think some sort of voting system should be placed for removing people from the room.			"

It's so bad, it's good.Just did a short 25 minute playthrough, and... It's kind of fun in a very confusing way. I was laughing because of how random and weird it was. If you're looking for some real skill based realistic multiplayer racing, is this game for you? Absolutely not.But if you're like me and just want a good laugh and some lighthearted fun, this game will do the job. The tutorials and voice acting are annoying and the Jester creeps me out, but it's good overall. xDThe Character ""Creation"" at the start lets you choose from two characters and 3 ""dresses"" each at the start, so that's a little disappointing, but not a big deal. xDAlso you can't change the resolution, so unless your monitor fits the default resolution, you'll have to put up with a squished image.In the end, there are a lot of things wrong with this game, but they're wrong in a way that just makes the game humorous and slightly enjoyable.In a serious gameplay view, I wouldn't give it more than 2/10, but as far as levels of fun and enjoyment, I'd gladly give it a 6.5/10 It's definitely worth a try. It's free after all. I won't complain. xDFor those of you interested in seeing my failed attempts at understanding this game, see the video below. Please be kind. I know I'm stupid. xD

												This is an extremely odd mashup of a Elsword and Mario Kart. It is actually *really* fun, but it has been around for a very long time before this Steam release so it has a population of very experienced skilled players. It also has a mechanic where once the first person finishes a race a short timer counts down and when it expires, the race immediately finishes. Because of this, in every one of the 10 or so multiplayer races I've done- I've only actually gotten to the finish line once. Every other time (even if I was in 2nd or 3rd place), the top 1 or 2 racers are so much better than everyone else that nobody else gets to finish the race. To me, this is kind of a deal breaker as far as playing this game a lot. I'm sure I'll pull it out for a race or two once in a while because it really is fun, but it's frustrating to essentially never get to finish a game.			"

												I remember playing Tales Runner a pretty long time ago, Im not sure when though but I know I enjoyed it. I played the Steam version a little bit since it released on here, and I have to say the overall gameplay I still enjoy. My biggest negative I have to say, is that it does feel more pay to win now than it did years ago. I cant put my finger exactly on one thing though. overall I would recommend you try the game, as its worth at least that I think. Especially if it interests you enough to read the reviews.   Overall I wish that someone else would make a game Like Tales Runner, It would be neat to see another game like it out there.  One with less ""junk"" or pay to win, that comes with being an old free to play title struggling to stay relevant.			"

												Tales Runner is a free to play runner and parkcur game.   IT didn't run well on my computer and it ejected me during the tutorial, saying i was hacking.  It did work, till it i was ejected. It uses X-Trap.I did not like it, so this is a quick review. Try it, maybe you like it.For more info, check these videos and links:

Anyways I tried to play it but it hung, so i closed it, however that stupid other program wouldnt close and just ran in the background, even if I task managered it to try and stop it, it wouldnt matter, it would still say closing in the background but thats it, also steam wouldnt let me play anything else becasuse it wasent finished shutting down or whatever it was doing hanging out in my background processes.  I couldnt shut down steam, eventually the only answer was to restart.  Would I recommend it...  Hells no! Don't ruin your Xmas			"

												when i installed it it also asks to install some other program, I dont remember what it is called now, but its essential to play,  somethink like when you try to play far cry you have to have that ubisoft thing on in the background.  Anyways I tried to play it but it hung, so i closed it, however that stupid other program wouldnt close and just ran in the background, even if I task managered it to try and stop it, it wouldnt matter, it would still say closing in the background but thats it, also steam wouldnt let me play anything else becasuse it wasent finished shutting down or whatever it was doing hanging out in my background processes.  I couldnt shut down steam, eventually the only answer was to restart.  Would I recommend it...  Hells no! Don't ruin your Xmas			"

												This is a game where your main objective it to...run with friends!  The game is overwhelmingly fun in a sense that it is easy enough to learn within 30 minutes.  It has a laid-back atmosphere in which you can unwind and enjoy some gaming with friends.  There is a diverse set of maps that you can choose to run around in.  Not to mention the design...unbelievably cute and colorful.			"

												I like how most of the reviews are trashing this game over the fact they don't want to spend at most $20 for it. The only problem i see is that it needs to fix the resolution. I played the Gpotato version for years until they closed and obviously it's not a bad game if so many people wanted it back that they made tons of private servers and eventually actually brought the game back. Some of the people i see posting bad reviews are likely to be the ones that get all butthurt when they can't win a race. True the gear helps but it's not all gear you have to actually be good at it. It's not meant to be a mmorpg like WoW or anything it's a racing game to just compete. There is no ""winning the game"" it's just for fun. You don't have to pay for all the gear and characters, if youl.. i don't know.. PLAYED THE GAME~ then you do what you're intended to do and collect to make the items yourself. So don't say it's a p2w cause you don't have to pay to get most any item in the game. Just cause you're too cheap to cough up a little money cause you don't want to actually get the things yourself doesn't mean the game is a p2w it means you're just a lazy cheapskate.			"

												So when I launched the game, the OGPlanet Launcher appeared. (That is the planet that all the Original Gangstas come from I presume) I created an account using my partypuffin72@gmail.com email address. (and named it the BreenMachine after my favourite actor of course)And then the launcher disappeared and a message appeared commanding me to close a debugger or something like that.All in all I'd say that this game (although short) provides a unique user experience that I have never been provided with before. And so I must recommend this game to those who are currently very bored and require a new experience.			"

Well There wasn't any hacks for TR back then but I don't think that Xtrap will ban them :(And last but the worst LAGS Well I kinda know why there were lags back then cuz of traffic but now OMG LAGS LAGS LAGS D:Well 3/10 I can't say that Gpotato will update their version but theres no hope for that cause As old TR got deleted No one saw Gpotato's activity :( All we got is a bad game and great memories :(			"

												As of right now. I dont think this is a good game. When I first got this i was REALLY late to the party but i was still enjoying myself. its colorful, has a lot of maps and if cool in general. but there are many cons. The controls are hard to get used to. There is a hude difference between players who have just started and players who have been here a while, and that is to be expected right? In this case its just downright stupid. The Moment you start you have no chance against anyone. All items seem to be on rent so when i cam back i lost ALL of my gear. The game keeps bugging you about ""newbie"" quest. And thats just it. Can the fact that some just started not be shoved in their face 24/7 by players and the games itself? there is much more to cover but right jow this game is bad.			"
