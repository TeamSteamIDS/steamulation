												It's complete and utter SH_T!!You left click to jump (with NO control while jumping) and right click to fire (only once every 20 - 30 seconds).Enemies or simple objects can take you out, with no way to avoid them whatsoever.This crap should not even be allowed on Steam!Requesting a refund!

Product received for free
												Listening to the same 2 maybe 3 soundtracks (cant tell nor care anymore) going on loop just gave my head that sort of nostalgic pounding feeling, furthermore the lack of audio options gave me a plentiful surprise as being unable to change audio in game I had to do so in an audio mixer. The lackluster and poorly made controls, along side with challengeing level design, gave each level plenty of replayability. The upgrade system is easily missed and most certainly not an integral part of the game, that even with the knowledge of said system you will definitly understand what each of the icons mean for the upgrades. If you find yourself in a bit of a challenge or you really want the MSpaint/most-likely-stolen-online charaters you can drop some extra cash (of which is equivilant or greater than the cost of the game itself) to gain more currency. Overall I would rate 9/11... "

												Only one playable character to start with, extras will be available through spending stars ingame.Gathering stars in the game is very time consuming.The only purpose of this game is, to force you into buying the DLCs to make progress.Don't fall for those fake positiv reviews.			"

												Cute, cheap and hard as hell.As somebody who spent weekends during my early teens trying to get past the early levels of SNES Super Mario All Stars games (I never made it past level 4 in any of them), I enjoy how incredibly hard this game is.It is also cool how collecting stars lets me buy more characters to play the levels again with using slightly different float/drift times etc.Am sure this will be a favourite for playing on long flights or other dead-time in the future.
