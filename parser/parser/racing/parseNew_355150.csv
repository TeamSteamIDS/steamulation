												Gravilon is a minimalistic, jumpless 2D platformer that has you tumbling a square end over end instead of smooth running and jumping. Its a game that requires patience from the player and it does everything it can in its minimalist art style to keep you calm and relaxed. You won't hear music so much as what sounds like rolling dice as your square tumbles end over end. Every level consists of black lines as platforms with a grey background. You'll see the previous level in the foreground and the next level in the background. Getting to the exit will fly you into the background and it makes for a beautiful touch.The object of each level is simply to make it to the end door a large blue square. The controls are simple,A and D keys will to shift your weight to tumble and the space bar will make slow motion that will give you greater control when you're in the air. Otherwise your momentum can make you easily miss something. Using slow motion drains the meter and it will build back up over time.Since there's no jump, its all about your momentum, the tumble will make you jump depending on the angle your square hits a surface. To make things interesting there are white anti-gravity cubes that will shift your square's gravity from the bottom to the top of the screen and vise versa. These cubes regenerate in a few seconds.The game benefits the tumbling with platforms that are on angles to tumble or slide down. Trying to move up any incline is a difficult feat that you'll need to shift your square's weight backward before you can shift it forward to have enough momentum to climb. Any over calculation can send you tumbling back down again.If you ever get stuck, just hit R to respawn. There are no lives. It doesn't reset the level, but it does put you back at the start. Any time you die from a death pit a hazard or a respawn, it leaves a dead black square. This makes the level feel alive seeing all your dead squares there. You can move them and bump into them. If you hit them hard enough they'll disintegrate.With the level design, you can make your own way. There's not one clear path to take. Its all about how you take the path you're on. Take one path too slow and you might be stuck. Take another path too fast you might not have the precision it takes to get through it. Levels get more difficult with the inclusion of yellow lines as hazards. One touch and you're dead just like a death pit.From the moment you start, you're in the game, with a quick hub world that lets you tumble to a doorway with continue, act 1, act 2, act 3, bonus and even quit. There's no main menu and it goes a long way to making you feel in game and keeping you there.If you're looking for a hand holding experience you won't find it here. Gravilon is a frustrating game almost from the start. The tumbling mechanic ensures that no attempt is exactly the same and a lot of the time it feels like luck rather than skill. Even when you spawn, its at a different angle, causing you to bounce from there. Your tumble could be off and it might send you somewhere completely different. That's why you need to use the slow motion a lot and even then I felt like I would die again and again. There are no checkpoints, every death restarts the level over again. It wouldn't be an issue if you weren't a tumbling square.To make matters worse your view can get obscured by the previous level. As much as I love the artistic effect it does get annoying. There might not be hand holding, but I don't expect them to cover my eyes either. The game will even turn my level transparent to focus in on the background.Since you can take your own path, you are allowed to keep trying to make the wrong path work. If you can only get the momentum to tumble up high enough you can make this path work! 15 minutes later, its time for a new path. Yet going back to the game, then you can get the momentum to make it work. Again, it feels like luck and not skill. Doing the same thing 100 times might yield the result you want.The beginning of the seventh level has a dead square and with that dead square you can make a path to an anti-gravity cube. Hitting that dead square knocks it out of place, preventing you from using it again on your next attempt, unless you set up your living square then kill it with a retry to have it in place as a dead square. That was my path for a while.The other path I could take is gaining enough momentum, but not too much because you'll knock yourself on a platform or overshoot the needle thin platforms you'll need to slow motion jump to. Then hope you have enough momentum to carry you into the anti-gravity cube or else you'll just have to try again and again. That's just how Gravilon is. You need patience. Your skill will not get you there.Each level can take under two minutes from start to finish and I'm telling you that to inform you that I'm three hours into the game and I have yet to complete the seventh level. I've never made it through the first act. Perhaps that truth is a testament to how bad I am at this game, or its a testament of a game that's a lot like a roll of the dice.Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Its all in the unique tumble mechanic. While it is an unique game with a great art style, its just not fun. Its painful and frustrating, but there are people out there that will love the steep difficulty and soothing atmosphere.The game wouldn't as frustrating if it weren't for the tumbling or even if it gave you a reward; some incentive to continue playing and push through the frustration. Your reward is another level. A game should be fun enough to be its own reward. Maybe there are fun, rewarding bonuses, but three hours and seven levels in, I wasn't able to unlock anything from the bonus content.While I can recommend it for its art style and low price tag, I just can't recommend it as a fun game. Perhaps I found it more frustrating than relaxing. Even if I didn't care for the game, I'd like to thank Fan Wu for giving me the game.			"

gravilon is the definition of minimalistic, there are no enemies, collectables, achievements or random dubstep outtakes. Controls are very simple, move left and right or slow down time briefly. Using these skills you need to find your way through each level. Design of the levels is where the genius comes in to play. Each crafted in ways that give a multitude of ways to finish them so not only does it leave plenty of room for experimentation but you feel like superman after pulling certain moves off successfully.Not sure exactly how many levels the game contains but you will quickly be scratching your head, progress is also rewarded with a subconscious story that slowly evolves in the background which I've yet to completely understand, which I think is the point but certainly adds a nice element.Basically if Super Meat Boy and Thomas was Alone had a stepchild, gravilon would be his name. If you ever wondered how a platformer might play with no jump button, this will give you some serious insight. Only small complaint is no native gamepad support but certainly not a dealbreaker. Highly recommended! Cheers. :)			"

												Past Level 1-2 or 1-3, gameplay becomes more frustrating than Super Meat Boy, and Super Meat Boy was more skill-based game (that is if you press exactly the same controls for the same time, the outcome will be identical); I made it up to 1-12 and at least 2 levels were 90% chance-based (the beginning of them to be exact). Using Space for slow-motion sometimes helps though.			"

												This game lacks a proper settings menu, and boots up with the default unity menu. This instantly makes it feel unfinished.The game itself is aesthetically pleasing, and the sound system is very well done, making it very immersive.Sometimes crucial parts of the levels are blocked by earliers levels that are overlapping them, so you can't really tell where you're going. I found this frustrating sometimes.The emoticons you get from crafting badges are a bunch of black lines that are barely visible over the grey steam chat background. I feel like no time went into making these which is a shame. Overall, I found this game fun to play for a few hours, but found myself bored with it very quickly.This game is definetely not worth $10, and it's debatable if it's worth the 20ct I payed for it.

												Gravilon is... not great.I'm a very big fan of minimalistic puzzle games (e.g. Hook, Hexcells, ♥♥♥♥♥), because they provide me with some activity to do when I want to relax and perhaps when I'm doing something else.Sadly, this game does not deliver on this.- The main menu looks like a mess.- The mechanics are not explained at all.- There seems to be a bit of an inconsistency in the way to solve puzzles.- The game becomes extremely repetitive really quickly.- The main idea seems very simple and not intriguing.Overall, I would recommend you stay away from this game, since it's not the money, but the time that will feel like a waste.3/10, simply because it feels wrong to give a game a 1 if you haven't played it more than an hour.

												this game doesn't explain how to play itself and the menus are a joke. this game isnt even worth the time it took to buy the bundle it was a part of and definitely not worth the wait for the card drops.the controls feel sloppy touchy and the cube doesnt move as well as you expect it to when you look at it. the aesthetics are nice but the previous levels block your view more often than they should and the opening intro is long an unnecessary. i get that this game is trying to do ""jumpless platforming"" but thats exactly what this game needs. dont waste your time on it unless you're really into obscure puzzle games.

												This indie game has smooth controls and interesting gameplay. The graphics are artisically minimilistic but the game still maintains a cool atmosphere. The point of the game is to reach the exit of the level with your character (a black square). You can roll, boost, and use the effects of gravity to make your way to the end. It's challenging but rewarding and I highly recommend it to people who are experienced with platformers because you will need your skills and patience on this one.			"

												Direct, perplexing, and dazzling. This aggregates up Gravilon charmingly. The purpose of the redirection is misleadingly essential. You control somewhat square that you ought to manual for the stage's exit. This is refined utilizing two limits: moving left and right; and the ability to by chance back off time. The delight world is contained solid straight lines, skimming dim squares (that address your past attempts), and minimal white spots that, once touched, change gravity. Humble parts, yet set up together stunningly make a platformer that tries to be something else and gets a kick out of the beating of your teeth. The level arrangement is constantly stunning and inventive, obliging you to acclimate to every test design Gravdev has arranged. Every time you start another level you spend the essential couple of tries genuinely making conviction based activities (the exit must be found in any case, clearly). For a delight made up of lines, the clone brush is pleasantly lost. You cross the world by using the dormancy grabbed from inconceivable drops and persistently changing gravity's headings. The mistake Gravilon subjects you to is outrageous, and accordingly your play session will typical around thirty minutes a pop. There is just so long you will have the ability to pound your head against the well known divider before a break is required. A stage will be clearly impassible; in any case, upon return with another mindset it is over the long haul overcome. There is an intriguing story suggested at all through the diversion, an illumination for the cemented world you live in. While unexpected and apparently pointless for such an essential platformer, it adds a constant drive to continue on. Gravilon and its mystery will take home in your mind until it is caught on. Each stage is layered one upon the other, and at evidently unpredictable centers the camera will zoom in two or three levels ahead to give you a gander at future levels, showing at something greater and revealing bits of an astound with the desire that you will see its aggregate. The sound framework is, afresh, insignificant yet wonderful. With basically a spooky vibe and the resounding uproar your square makes against the world, it genuinely highlights the stillness of the world. An extra favorable position? Keeping you calm after reiterated disillusionments. At the to an extraordinary degree low requesting that cost I disregard find a clarification behind what legitimate reason you should not give Gravilon a look. While direct, it is executed amazingly. To be sure, even the little graphical effects that are made while influencing a surface is fulfilling. You will have a lesser illicit relationship if you endeavor to complete it in one sitting; rather I recommend playing it sporadically. With a bit of the levels evidently incomprehensible I flew into a fierceness on various occasions, which convinced Gravdev may have horrible affinities. A break amidst every couple of attacks is perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed Gravilon sparingly through the traverse of a few weeks; its hunch perplex kept it holding up in my cerebrum between sessions. I may pay special mind to what design Gravdev has coming up next.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												The reason I bought this puzzle platformer is because I thought the basic idea was pretty clever. You start out 'running' above the platforms but you can change the gravity of the game so that you are then 'running' underneath those same platforms. But I should have read some more reviews here before I actually bought Gravilon. You see, besides that basic idea there is nothing here. - Movement is clunky. Yeah I know: ""What do you expect when your 'character' is a square?"" Well, I expected the flow of the game to be surprisingly smooth despite the fact that you're controlling a square. But it's not. - The game has no instructions or tutorial at all. Once you struggle through the initial menu and manage to start the game, you have no idea what the goal is. By chance, you'll discover how to change the gravity (hit a white square). Besides that, you'll 'do things' but will have no idea what you just did. Every time I hit a black square, I heard a sound effect telling me that 'did' something but I haven't got a clue what it was.- Level design is bland and uninspired. Look at the screenshots. - The game menus are confusing. For example, I still have no idea how to exit the game properly.- There is 'Partial Controller Support'. This means you can use the buttons of compatible controllers, but not the stick. The dev replied to a discussion about this that that was intended. Ow-kay...Bottom line: this game is just no fun. At all. So I can't recommend it. At all.			"

												So, this game is needlessly difficult. Not that it should be easy, but the difficulty is not based on any skill or timing but on getting lucky on how your cube bounces. The game requires a precision that the controls don't afford, and the levels are either straightforward to the point of being linear or so jumbled that the solution is lost in a mess of lines and dots. The main menu is as difficult to navigate as the levels, and the ""minimalism"" just leaves the player hanging for some kind of story or reason to reach the end of the level. It has some moments, but it's nowhere near worth $5. Nor is it worth the time it takes to solve the puzzles.			"

												I haven't played much of gravilon yet, but my first impression is that it's beautiful, clever and fun.  The whole game is minimalistic, the visuals, the audio, the controls, the level design.  But from only a handful of game mechanics there is a lot of depth.  The physics-based platforming is very difficult, but it feels so good that you just want to keep doing it and getting better.This game does not hold your hand.  Some of the paths you need to take are a bit hidden at first, but the level design is clever enough that when you do find the path, you know that you've found it.  It doesn't coddle you, but it sets you up well to figure it out yourself.So far I'm only up to level 1.7, which has a puzzle right at the start.  Up till that point there was a feature of the game that I'd noticed, but I didn't really understand why it was there.  Then I realised that this little feature I'd been ignoring was the solution to the puzzle, and I was blown away.  gravilon had been teaching me this mechanic for the last few levels and I had hardly noticed it, then it said, ""Nope, you're not going any further till you pay attention and notice what's going on here.""  I love it when a game teaches me a new way of thinking, and gravilon has done that in the first Act.  I'm seriously looking forward to seeing what else is in store.I only have a few little complaints, mainly that there is no built in gamepad support.  I can map keys with Xpadder or joy2key, but it would be nice not to have to do this.  If you die you don't automatically restart, you have to hit R, but I can see why that decision was made.  The game isn't hurrying you along to keep trying, it's letting you set the pace.  It's good to be aware of though.  Finally, there is a time slowing mechanic, which I think is just to help with tricky spots, but I don't use it.  It's not really taught to the player, and I haven't needed it so far.  It's entirely possible it will become more relevant later.TL;DR haiku:a minimal gamelooked interestingtotally blew me away			"

												Gravilon is a minimalist puzzle-platformer. Your task is simple, get your sqaure block from it's spawn point to the exit. However the task's execution is quite challenging.The rest of the game is cryptic, the levels are designed as different plains you move. All are pretty short, but this doesn't mean they are easy, on the contrary. You can only move left and right (including momentum building), but there are certain points where gravity can be inverted. The few levels I have played so far were good and gave me some feeling of accomplishment once I figured out the solution and actually executed the plan successfully. Gravilon is definitely worth playing!			"

												This is a lovely made minimalistic 2D platformer, where you play as a cube and you have to reach the end somehow. As the name of the game says it, the path to finish the levels isn't easy. Beside some barriers and obstacles, which you have to pass through, you have to deal with the gravitation.This game principle isn't that bad and the realization with a minimalistic design is also right okay. But still, this makes fun for just a short time, after that it's hard to find the motivation to play the game through. Beside that, you need nerves of steel to play some levels because it's ridiculously hard. And the gameplay and movement is also at some points quite frustrating. So I can't really recommend this game, it's just for hardcore arcade and platformer gamers.Summary+minimalistic design+no bugs found+works on old/low graphics PC's-frustrating gameplay-uninspired level designs-way to hard-save points-confusing main menu			"

If there's any story in this, I can't tell and really, I'd rather waste my time with some Tetris if I want to stare at lifeless blocks sliding across the screen. This game is a single idea stretched so thin you'd be hardpressed to see anything left of it after 5-6 levels. Definitely pass.			"

												Having played this game until the start of act three I can say that the difficulty curve on this game is so sharp I actually have nightmares on what act four might be like, and by act five I expect the game to be completely black and force you to balance taxes with an abacus while doing ΔX limits with your feet and having your mother scold you for not being married with children yet. That being said, I payed ¢.50 so it was P good overall.			"

												Gravilon is a strategy, minimalist, puzzle indie game that doesn't really control well. The movement isn't good, sending you places you don't want to be, and turning isn't smooth either. However, the game is unique, with a cool little graphics style.Don't get me wrong, I don't hate this game, I just wouldn't recommend it to people. if you want a game that controls well similar to this, get INK. Now, back on topic. The game is very cool, when you talk about graphics. Some of the levels make no sense, and since the turning controls don't work too well, this can make some levels, more difficult than they needed to be. The settings menu isn't that great, and the main menu is worse. The controls on the main menu are everywhere, making it hard for you to find what you are looking for. This game couldv'e benefited from also being played with a XBox controller. Also, when trying to move up things, it can be difficult, because, since your character doesn't go fast, you won't be able to get up there with ease.Overall, this game isn't one I would recommend. This game looks awesome, but controls badly. If you want a game similar, and better than this, I would recommend INK, because I don't recommend this.			"

												Price / hour: 0,29€Price / hour with -76% off: 0,07€It's Mixed-rated game for a reason. It's very chill based game and it's good for empty your mind and play something peaceful between days of FPS games with all the explosions and stuff. But chill games ain't for everyone, especially this chill.Pros:- Very peaceful- Awesome and unique graphics and idea- Some difficult puzzlesCons:- I came back to this game after long break. There was a new launcher and guess what, I was at Act III of the game and my save were gone, completely. I hope it's only because of the new launcher, not that it would happen every update.. So if u want rly complete this game I suggest to backup the game files or something. This was so annoying, to repeat the levels that I did already.- It's awesome graphics but would need a little more color in my opinion. It's peaceful but little bit depressing colors.- There's a speciality that you can slow your cube. I am not sure am I doing the puzzles right but sometimes I have to wait in a corner attached to a wall to the speciality refresh and I can ""wallclimb"" to proceed. It's annoying to wait like that without purpose.Conclusion: For its price, it's definitely to look for, if you like puzzle games or want something peaceful to your day, instead of buying a cheese burger.

												What would you say to a platformer where you have to roll around a square? Not push, roll. I'm sure the concept has been done well somewhere (EDGE comes to mind), but it's certainly not an appealing hook, clunking a box all around. You'd have to do something really special with the controls or levels to overcome how onerous the basic movement is. Have you noticed I've been talking around the game in question here?Gravilon is a puzzle platformer where you roll a square around a bunch of floating lines. Other than some floaty movement and dots you can touch to reverse gravity, the rolling is just as clunky as you're imagining. You can build up momentum to cross gaps, which you'll need to do pretty much all the time, but it makes your box extremely difficult to control. And that's a pretty core problem with the game, because not half a dozen levels in it gets blisteringly hard. You'll start being expected to make long precision jumps and clutch gravity flips, and falling off the level or touching deadly yellow lines starts the whole level over.There are a few extra tools you have to overcome these difficulties, like a slow-motion button and the fact that when you die or reset, your previous square remains in the level. But rather than supporting your efforts, these mechanics become required before even warming you up to how they work. All of this takes place in a gray void with the next and previous levels visible in the back and foregrounds, which sounds cool except they're all made of the same black lines and blend together into a visual mess. Add a plain-text menu that looks like fifteen minutes of placeholder programming, and you have an unpolished, unbalanced ball of frustration on your hands. And it doesn't even roll right.			"

												2D Platformer where the goal is to reach the exit of every level. The player controls a square and moves it by ""rolling"" towards either left or right. There's no jumping, but there are ""pellets"" placed around the levels which, when touched, reverses the gravity. There's a limited but recharging slow-mo ability which improves left/right movement, especially when on air.The controls can be annoying at times, like when you're trying to go up a ""step"" but you're somehow ""stuck"" coz you're a square and your movements are affected by gravity. But that's just the beginning! Since a major part of the game is to grab those ""pellets"" that can reverse gravity, hitting them with your sexy square body can be a real pain. Most times, these pellets are in hard to reach areas where one wrong move would cause you to repeat the whole level. The worst part? Physics betrays you coz either you bounce too soft or too hard that you would miss the pellet.Well, I just found the game too slow and silent. Most of what you would hear is the box's edges thumping on the platform, and that's it. Ah, just another day in the life of a box! For extra details, no I did not finish Act I and I never knew how many levels I am before the next one.One more thing. I don't know if I'm okay with half a dollar for this game. I've played too many free platformer flash games online and they provided way more fun and thrill.			"

												I finally found something that bullet time can't fix: physics-based platforming with physics that don't work how the developers seem to think they do.First run did give me the option to supply my email address to get a Steam key for something that looks a little more tolerable, though. If it's sufficiently on sale and you can stand the wait for the cards to drop, might as well get it (or sucker someone into buying it for you as a last-minute birthday/christmas gift) just for that.

												I quit on level 1.3. 'Nough said.Well, since you probably want to know why, and I want to rant, I suppose that's not 'nough...So first there's no instructions beyond a flash of the controls, which is fine, for simple controls it's ok to just jump right in, but I almost didn't believe that the only controls were A and D (and space (pointless), and r (probably the most pressed key)). The first two levels do an ok job of being a tutorial of sorts. Then level 1.3 is the first real challenge. And yes, it's a challenge. If you don't (slowly) tumble perfectly to hit the dots, the game is very unforgiving. But, to make things more interesting, the square doesn't tumble exactly the same way everytime... meaning you can't simply memorize the perfect key timings. You will soon build up a cluster of corpses just past the first dot as you fail to hit the dot squarely, and another just past the second dot as you soar past it. The third dot on the other hand has a pile of corpses just below it as once you finally manage to shoot the dime out of the air, you need a perfect momentum vector to get you to the next platform. If you don't... down you go.This game is relegated to those not-right-in-the-head individuals living in their mother's basement making Youtube videos of perfect run throughs after playing 200 hours perfecting every muscle twitch. For normal humans, don't waste your time. Go play meatboy if you like mashing the reset button. (thankfully, the game has been in the background making cards while I write this).			"

												I only got this because it came free with the ""Art Appreciation"" Pack, but little did I know that by ""Art Appreciation"", the designers forgot to leave the ""F"" at the beginning, because Gravilon is the closest thing a game can be to a small fart that no one notices, until you smell it.Immature humor aside, let's talk about the story... well, there is no story, so I'm not sure where the ""though-provoking"" tag the designers slapped on applies. Maybe it's thought-provoking, in the sense than you'll be thinking about how much you want to shove something up this cube's a**, that it'll finally jump! Or maybe properly move around. I first thought it was odd how in Pretentious Game and Thomas Was Alone, that the blocks moved by sliding around. But that's leagues better than Gravilon, because actually getting the damn cube to move is a challenge in itself. Who thought it was a good that you had to build momentum by rolling a cube!?On top of the awkward movement, it's enhanced all the more by the fact that you can't jump! I'm serious. You cannot jump in this puzzle-platformer. I thought that the designers might have used that as an excuse for more unique level designs, but most of these puzzles would be far easier if you could actually jump instead of fall of the edge of a platform and awkwardly steer your way to a cube that's one-tenth smaller than you in the hopes you can reverse your gravity.The level design is, needless to say, garbage. The backgrounds are just gray, with the next level in the background, and the previous level usually blocking platforms you'll have to land on and end up having to guessing when you move onto them. There's so much crap thrown around in each level that it can leave the level open to a player's interactions, but there's usually only one way to get to the final gate conventionally and one completely unorthodox way (most of the time I found this method unintentionally). See, VVVVVV (a similarly blocky gravity-related platformer) gave you a character you could actually control with nice, tight controls and let you ""jump"" by reversing your gravity whenever you want. And it even had a story! Not a very interesting story, but at least it had one.There's little reason to buy Gravilon. You can tell someone had a good idea, and designed a very pretty game. The sound is great (if only there was some actual music to compliment it) and that aside, I think, pretty much sums up Gravilon. A pretty game that still needs a lot of work. Movement needs to be a lot tighter, a story wouldn't hurt to make the game more ""thought-provoking"", added-in jumping mechanics would help immensely, and a better menu at this point is definitely mandatory. The in-game menu and main menu are total garbage, with their Calibri font and odd placement of options. If the designers actually take in this criticism, Gravilon could potentially become the next ORION: Prelude. Until then, Gravilon still needs a lot of work to actually become ""decent"".			"

-Quick Review-Gravilon might create it's own genre of game called ""Puzzle Platformer"". Gravilon has a unique spin on a combining minimalist graphics and creating a 2D-platforming-puzzle atmosphere. While the game is very simple in appearance the game jumps in difficulty very quickly.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There really isn't a story in Gravilon, you're a block exploring the vastness of.... Gravilon.Game Play: I personally love simple controls, because then you can make the gameplay more complex and difficult based around simple controls. (for example, with Super Meat Boy, you have insanely difficult levels, but simple controls)For Gravilon, you move right or left, and have a ""slow down time"" move, most of the game complexity and difficulty comes from the environment, you can reverse your gravity by touching little white blocks.There are often times multiple paths to complete a level, once you spawn into a level, you need to make your way to the ""end block"".Achievements: There are no achievements for Gravilon at this time. Thank goodness, the achievements would undoubtedly be as difficult as the game. (it's always possible they might be added, just so I pull out my hair in frustration.)Price Gravilon is priced at $1.99, that's a fair asking price for the amount of time most people will spend playing this game.Conclusion: Gravilon is a nice short game that you'll play for a couple hours, depending on how good you are at puzzle + 2D + platformers and or divided by stubbornness, you can probably drag out more time from the game.While I don't really feel too strongly one way or another towards this game, I would recommend checking it out if for no other reason then supporting the indie developer, quaint games like there are abundant but I personally always enjoy playing them.

""roll"" into a white block to reverse gravity is probably the only good idea they had. first 4 ""course's"" were fun but after that they get so ridiculous its hard to tell where you need to go and previous courses somtimes block your view of where you are and whats infront of you its like when your watching a movie at home and someone sits infront of you at an angle where they block a corner of your view of the screen. and you wanna tell them to move their♥♥♥♥♥over but you dont like conflict so you just sit there trying to ignore it.

												I'm gonna tell my personal experience with this game:- I had the patience to made it to stage 1-9, but I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I wanted to just punch someone on the face. I spent almost 2 hours on stage 1-7, because of the stupid beginning, that is more luck than skill to pass by. I wish I was playing something else than wasting my time on a stupid stage over and over, but unfortunally I was waiting for last card to drop.- This game feels like no one tested it, cause the square you control sometimes stuck, and some of the ""gravity pills"" you gotta pick to change gravity are almost impossible to get before die 1000000 times. Games are supposed to be fun, and not to make us angry!- I couldn't find a way to quit the game. Seriously! I had to press Alt+F4.

Four buttons, and you couldn't make it to Xbox controller? Thanks god for JoyToKey.- The game tries to be different, leaving the last stage you played in front of the stage you are currently playing, but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t always keeps getting in the way, making it hard/impossible to see where to go. Unnecessary.I usually do not vote or review puzzle games, because they are something that usually differ from person to person, some may have patience, some not. But this game really♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.

												The basic concept behind the game is interesting, but is severely hampered by everything else about this game's execution.  This game is simple enough that a few screenshots with captions could act as a tutorial, but the developer didn't even bother with something so simple. Graphics are way too simple, even a little variety in the shapes of the 'floors' and the player's cubed, maybe with a bit of colour variation now and then, would have helped massively.Overall, buy only if you feel the pricing is dirt cheap, and just want to play around with the core mechanic.

It's hard. Really hard.Like, die and try again 100 times on the same level because you really know you can do it.The reason it's better is becuase there are more levels to get to. You can see them, right there in the background.If you liked Floating Point, you will really like this because the levels keep going, push you to be better.			"

												Gravilon thats a Game, at the beginning you start in the menu where u have to play to play... ähh yeah :)A lovely, playeable menu and the ""normal"" levels ... Hardcore stuff !!!,  but if you clear a stage you will jump around.I like this puzzle platformer. Use powerups in each environment, and your own inherent gravity-bending powers, to complete each level. The more you play, the more story details you'll uncover. Within an unique style, enjoy ... Gravilon :D "

												The game is minimalist gravity puzzle fun.It's up to you to choose if you will find the price worth it. A dollar an hour usually goes well when comparing regular outings. You'd get this and it is your's to play.Maybe 2 dollars an hour worth for games with a lot of thinking rather than time sinking.I'd say it's worth it, the gravity and minimalist gaming makes the little things satisfying. The clicking of you moving around, the gravity power activating. It's fun. I like it. I recommend it.			"

												Gravilon is equal parts fascinating and frustrating.  I absolutely love the minimalistic style - its very unique and I haven't come across anything else like it.  The controls are simple - left and right.  Instead of using the spacebar to jump, you use it to slow time - another really cool and unique feature that I enjoyed.  As with all platformers, the goal is simple - make it to the end of the level.  But unlike a sidescrolling platform, your world is smaller and gravity works both ways.  You navigate lines by either rolling on top of them or floating under them, depending on your gravity situation.  Sometimes your exit portal is right beneath you, but you have to manuever around in a circle hitting several gravity switchers to make it to your destination.As someone who isn't great at puzzle games, I found the levels very difficult.  This game takes patience to hit small targets precisely and to control the speed of your moving block.  Holding down the A or D button even a second too long would build too much momentum and I would fly off course.The lack of music, the minimal look (almost like modern art), the simple controls and the cool gravity switcharoo make this a game that's easy to return to, even for just a couple of minutes.  But be prepared for a challenge! "

												Gravilon is yet another indy 2D platformer in a saturated market.   Graphics are ultra primitive, although it looks like they at least hired an artist (to make the rectangles the right mix of pastels and grey colours).   It runs quite smoothly (because a PC from 1990 could run this game smoothly). Gameplay is tedious platforming, as you roll a square around a terrain constructed of rectangles.   The big gameplay twist?  You run into little white squares that change the direction in which you fall.   Negotiating levels is a matter of rolling your square to the right coloured rectangle.Adding esoteric atmosphere to a low effort 2D platformer is not re-inventing the gaming industry.   If you want abstract art, go to an art gallery and get some fresh air.   If you're a gamer, there's nothing here for you.			"

												Imagine playing Super Monkey Ball with a cube while being bound and gagged.  That experience is similar to playing Gravilon.It tries to do new things, but commits a lot of design flaws that contemporary platformers like Super Meat Boy streamlined.  Dying does not automatically restart the level, and the animation runs a little long.  Inertia is difficult to judge, much less use with pinpoint precision.  The arrow keys are not mapped for use.  And for God's sake, you're semi-randomly tumbling around as a square.I did find its level design interesting and mostly appropriate, but basic movement was just too puzzling to stay fun.  Sometimes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel - pun intended.			"

												I read through the steam reviews and there were quite a few people who said that the game is luck based, has bad controls and a terrible menu.  Now, I'm not one to say that games are bad usually, and like to think that I think the best of things, and the good reviews said amazing things.  So I ignored the bad reviews, mistake number one, I then bought the game, mistake number two.  When the game opened it opened the default unity menu, which I'm fine with, however once the menu opened and I saw that the left and right keys ('a' and 'd') were completely different from the up and down keys ('u' and 'n') I began to have second thoughts, and when I realised I couldn't change the controls I began having third thoughts.  I then started playing, I still have no clue what the up and down do, it doesn't move the character up and down, it doesn't change gravity to be more or less, or if it does it does it in the smallest increments imaginable.  And the first level (spoilers?) is possible to complete by holding the 'a' key... SOMETIMES... because at random the character doesn't bounce the same way it did the last time, so by holding the 'a' key multiple results can be achieved, the square can win by getting to the end of the level, the square can hit a wall, lose all it's momentum and fall out the world, or fall out a hole in the ground because it didn't bounce the right way over it.HOWEVER, it does have very nice musickinda summing up:-  bad control setup - can't be changed-  gameplay? - winning levels by holding a key down-  explanations - or rather the lack of-  nice musicTL:DRdon't getEDIT:there's a story?

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Mini Puzzle platform game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is No Menu at all!You will be dropped instantly to the game.The game has many resolution sizes.You are able to play with fullscreen or windowed mode.About the game.You are a square that is Moving to left or the right. You can't jump over obstacles and things but you are able to roll over them. The controls could be clunky or something that you have to get used to. You are able to slow down things that are around you which will make it easier to climb over those things and increases your speed towards that direction. You have to reach the blue square to finish the level. There are white dots around some levels which wil change your gravity upside down.There is No music.You will only hear ""Tic, tic tic"" sound when moving. (and some background noise)You are able to reset the current level.You can not change your controls. You can turn the volume ur or lower by pressing The arrows keys up or down.I find the game very boring and repetive. Especially if there is no music.Other things.If you are resetting a level, the current square will turn into a black square which will act like an extra blockade.This could prevent you from dying because you have to hit it once before it will vanish away.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

												Do you know what makes a physics platformer so much fun?Flinging the player through the air at high speeds with broken collusion detection. In later levels there's no guarantee you won't just phase through the platform and turns fairly straightforward stages into a nightmare. The foreground also has a bad habit of obscuring the view at crucial moments and the main menu is such a masterpiece of bad design that exiting the game can take multiple tries from the midgame onwards.

												In Gravilon, the player controls a colored cube through levels resembling a Microsoft paint file made by a person who had the line tool open as he had a seizure. As you can probably tell from the pricetag, the screenshots, and the other reviews, this is yet another physics-based platformer where depth and volume of content gives way to high difficulty.	That isn't to say that the game doesn't have its moments. I spent far more time with it than I honestly think it was worth, and discovered interesting level design, with solutions often requiring planning and careful application of the game's two big ""gimmicks"": the ability to slow time, and the ability to reverse gravity.	Unfortunately, the game has a ton of problems. The biggest issue is the distinct gap that may appear to the player, between knowing how to get through a level, and actually being able to do it. Though conquerable through sheer persistence, this game is still quite hard, largely due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t foreground objects that can and will obstruct sight at vital moments, the camera which, especially in the later levels, is incapable of a helpful degree of control, and the inconsistency of platforming afforded by the cube itself.	Apart from embedding itself in some objects and phasing through others at high enough speeds, the cube can also be prone to slowing or hopping due to its angles. While this can be helpful, as it can be necessary to build momentum using rocking motions, and the angles are good for hooking onto ledges, the downside is that there is little way to tell in advance how an approach to a certain platform can be handled. Sometimes I can stop myself from going over the edge in time, sometimes I can't. The best analogy I can offer is like trying to fudge a dice roll.	If you can handle all of that, then it simply comes down to being able to beat a level in one sitting. There are no checkpoints, you screw up once, it's back to the beginning of the level, and of course it's one of those games where each level consists of several ""do it perfectly or die"" moments. Had there been more depth to the game, I would not have had a problem with trying over and over, but it didn't have enough depth, and I kept at it anyway, and in the end the experience was not very enjoyable.

												Esse é o verdadeiro ""Thomas IS alone"".  Tudo bem que a proposta do jogo é ser um puzzle e etc e ela não é ruim. Mas não tem muito o que recomendar sobre o jogo sabe? Gosto muito de Indies que conseguem ser simples e super legais mas esse não tem o fator SUPER legal. Ele é legal mas não o suficiente para te manter empolgado ou curioso enquanto joga.   A trilha sonora aparece mais quando você ""morre"" e precisa resetar para iniciar a fase ou você fica ali no limbo. Ele poderia te introduzir um contexto no jogo, não necessariamente um narrador ou uma história, mas não tem contexto algum (além do chute pelo nome e os elementos que aparecem no jogo).   Ele poderia ter ficado melhor com simples alterações. O Menu, inclusive, ficou ótimo - é um menu interativo (que nem em Trine ou em Rayman). E possui algumas movimentações e elementos interessantes, como uma ativação de câmera lenta, dificuldade no controle por causa da inércia + gravidade e alteração da mesma; mas nada mais tão especial além disso.   Acho que me decepcionei um pouco porque o vídeo de apresentação me fez ter uma expectativa um pouquinho maior.Mesmo assim, 4/10. Obs: Compre em promoção!!! Rs			"

It was A LOT OF luck-based and the controls were extremely hard to understand and finally ""master"", but still the game is kinda of relaxing (yet frustating) because of his graphic all in pastel colors and the good music. I'd recommend to help the devs so they can improve the game (it's extremely cheap and it will take like 1h of your life).			"

												EDIT: I was kinda harsh before. The launcher actually works, and the game you get for free, Polarity, is pretty nice. still maintaing my opinion about Gravilon, but at least you're wasting your money or something.It's the kind of game you get in a bundle and never open it. There's nothing attractive to it and you could get the same experience from a flash game on a random site.			"

Basic awkward 2D platformer3/10 ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆GameplayGravilon offers navigation of simple shapes on almost empty screen. The only idea is control a protagonist - ▄ , yep, just this - from platform to platform, saving it from plumetting. Gravity is the only enemy in here, gravity is the only idea in here. Gravity is in the game's name. Apart from gravity, not much to write home about.Controls are nonresponsive adding to the game's difficulty. This is not this type of diffculty you call challange - you will find it a reason to deinstall the game.PresentationGraphics are symbolic. Had the mechaniacs been sound, it would have been justified and meaningful. As the gameplay is awkward and limited, the presentation seems lazy.One of the worst menu I have ever seen in my life.Audio... there is some... I'm sure, there is. Hmmmm.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Summing upOversimplistic confusing experience almost not worth to be called a game.positive cheap Trading Cardsnegative extremely limited gameplay oversimplified presentation unresponsive controls terrible menuCheap Trading Cards, not much else. Cannot recommend. "

												Gravilon is simple, minimalist, and sadly flawed physics game.  The goal is simple: navigate a square from one door to another, using tiny cubes to defy gravity, become gravity-bound, and reach each door.  Even in the first few levels, however, this is somewhat difficult, and can even become repetitive.  Here's why:1. Remember those tiny cubes I mentioned?  Note the word tiny, as these cubes can be extremely hard to grab because of their size.  I give the designers credit for planting more than enough cubes across the level (thus welcoming different strategies to reach the door), but it is very frustrating to go toward one and just miss it, over and over and over.  This usually results in death, and could easily be solved by increasing its size.  But the small size, along with being at the mercy of physics as you (most of the time) hurtle yourself towards them, makes switching your gravity much more difficult than it needs to be.2. Level design.  It is inherently flawed.  Levels have holes that you can get easily stuck in (again, because of being at the mercy of physics), stopping your movement entirely,  and you must start the level over.  These ""holes"" are in plenty of places, and are simply frustrating; sometimes, you can even fall in badly-placed holes, and die.  You can also get stuck on high slopes, as they are impossible for a cube to travel up; the cube stops, and often you must restart the level.  It can't be attributed to trying to make the game ""more difficult""; this is an inherent flaw of the game.3. Lack of tutorial.  After Level 2 (could have been after Level 1, actually), the game seems to say, ""Got the mechanics?  Good, now you can handle a really long level.""  They don't really ease the player into it, but throw the player in the moment the mechanics become understandable.I like the minimalistic look, colors, and gameplay of Gravilon.  But its bad level design, flawed gravity mechanic, and lack of proper tutorial makes it frustrating.  Even so, it has its charm, and I actually like controlling the cube when it comes down to it (though the slow-mo mechanic is fuctionally useless, but kinda neat).  Its sound design is simple, but also very well done.  I recommend it, but keep in mind its flaws.(p.s.: According to the description, the ""story unfolds in the background', and you will ""learn about your role in the world"" the more you play.  I have yet to see the story, but look forward to it.)			"

												A very difficult, minimalist puzzle platforming game.All you have to do is roll your block to the exit.  You get interesting powers like slowing time and reversing gravity.  However, sometimes the difficulty is so high it feels like beating a stage is more luck than skill.For a platforming game, controls are everything, and this game controls well.  Not a great game, but if you get it on sale good for a few hours of fun.6/10			"

												Although minimalistic, this game has a nice atmosphere and the feeling of achievement you get once you pass a difficult level is great!  Most of the levels can be completed in different ways which means each person can have a different strategy that still works.100% worth the 0.99 I paid for it.

												I picked this game up for 19 cents, and it's worth ten dollars, apparently, but I just can't see it at that price.It reminded me of Limbo, the best indie I've ever layed my eyes upon, but while this comes nowhere near, I'd say it's price is $5.99 at most.While the art style is impeccable, the gameplay is really inspired by Limbo, and if you came looking for an original indie game, you've come to the wrong place.It even lets you switch between gravity, but for the price I picked it up, it's a nice little decoration for your Steam library.Also, this game will most likely run on any computer (I have an AMD Radeon, so if you have something Nvidia, it should run a million times better than mine)Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.

												First off, I'm already proud to have purchased this during this weekend's deal of only 21¢ (CAD)! Moreover, I originally wasn't sure whether this might be worth those few cents or not ... but looked pretty good to me, personally, for a minimalistic physics-puzzle game. On that note: if time remains to its sale (until 26 Oct, 2015 at 1 PM EST), this is indeed a definite must-buy.Although absent of a music track, I managed with a playlist of ZEBLAZED and The Late December's tracks. For anyone who wants a similar immersive experience like I had, I totally recommend you play this listening to them in the background. Honestly, in that regard, I'd even recommend the developers to add some sort of music feature. Then again, regardless, I enjoy it quite brilliantly with my own method!This, in many respects, is the most minimalistic game I've played. The stunning environments, sounds (as mentioned in the previous paragraph, there is no music), and controls all contribute to make this a seemingly less-is-more experience—minding, I'm not even sure yet as to how many levels there are total!• The controls are about more minimal than the levels themselves. This, using Unity's system for launch, there is adequate customization for the controls. The levels, on the other hand, are intricately designed, and, as this game's own sypnosis says it, thought-provoking! I literally did stop at a few moments to think about the path I was trying to move across, and as accurate to that path as possible! Alongside the levels and controls, there's also the physics, which surprisingly, to myself, did actually make it a lot easier to move, whether it's 'climbing' on top of one the lines or flying across the level—unless, of course, you instead fly off the level.*9 Levels completed out of 10!* "

I like how hard this game is and liked the concept. Give it a try.If you like puzzle games that you can jump out a phase without doing it or do a phase just trying a lot without trying hard, I think this game isn't for you.However, if you love a challenge you can like it.The best thing I can say is give it a try. In my opnion it's a great game.			"

Or maybe if you are pro at puzzle games you might complete levels fast. *The graphics are very nice and every pixel of it runs very smoothly. Not even a single bug in this piece of crap notebook I have. *The main menu is already a game itself. So if you are horrible at this game, you might just rage quit and use task manager to close it.This game. 10/10 Very much recommend if you like to play puzzle games.  "

												Many people give a dislike because this game is hard,yes it is hard, and yes sometimes you die because of the bouncing of the cube,a big part of it you can controll yourself though. All of this makes it even more rewarding when you finally complete that level.+ Very nice level design+ Smooth gameplay+ Takes little space on HDD+ Very rewarding+ Steam trading cards (if you sell these the game is practically free or ven profitable)+ Responsive controlls+ Challenges you to find a way trough the level+ Path to finish is not clear at the start of level, hell even the position of the finish isn' t clear, you will have to explore- Lack of tutorial (or introduction to the goal and uses of certain blocks)(don't worry controlls are given though)- Frustrating when you cannot pass the level- Limited graphics (duh)- Limited in customizability "

												One of those artsy games with about as much personality as a sheet of drywall, it challenges your ability to tilt a square and bounce just right to pick up a power pellet, navigate reversed gravity around deadly obstacles without falling asleep at your keyboard.  Load it up, go to sleep and then collect your steam trading cards and you'll get approximately the same experience as if you had played the game!  Certainly not worth full price, unless the game suddenly has you sprouting wings and arming up with twin vulcan cannons to take out the dark hordes of glowy dots.  If you like physics based, minimalistic platforming where you have to carefully explore and maneuver just right to reach the goal, with a very light soundtrack to zen out to, then you might be a better match for this game than I.  As it is, it feels like the kind of game you might play on your smartphone while on a two hour bus ride, compelling, but not so much that you're itching to jump back into it.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Gravilon is a very minimalist design in terms of graphics with a strong emphasis on platforming and judging your momentum so as not to fall off the platforms. There are also switches that change the direction of gravity which you have to use to navigate to the end of the course.It could have been good. It could have been very good. But it is incredibly frustrating to get through just the first levels. The difficulty curve is ramped right up and there is very little margin for error. The only thing that softens the blow is there are some checkpoints dotted around the levels, but these are few and far between, so often you have to replay large sections of a level if you mistime it just slightly.Great minimalist graphics, sounds can be a bit grating and the difficulty is unforgiving. If you want to have no hair then feel free to play this. Otherwise, I'll have to give this one a miss, I'm afraid.			"

												Somehow this game showed up in my library the other day and said I had bought it back on the 10th of August as a part of an 'art appreceation pack'. I know for a fact that the bundle didn't come with this game, but I couldn't get a refund for it so I decided I might as well give it a go.Not a very good idea.I find this game to be quite difficult and very boring/confusing to play. But games like this aren't up my ally anyhow. The ambiance is somewhat nice, but I feel as if that is one of the only things going for this game.			"

It is fun game to play, with it's jumpless platforming and time control mechanics feel good to play with. There isn't much to the game, simple mechanics, good music and the way it transitions from one level to another is pretty neat. All in all, something you should check out, just for the fun of it.

												Gravilon is a minimalistic, jumpless 2D platformer that has you tumbling a square end over end instead of smooth running and jumping. Its a game that requires patience from the player and it does everything it can in its minimalist art style to keep you calm and relaxed. You won't hear music so much as what sounds like rolling dice as your square tumbles end over end. Every level consists of black lines as platforms with a grey background. You'll see the previous level in the foreground and the next level in the background. Getting to the exit will fly you into the background and it makes for a beautiful touch.The object of each level is simply to make it to the end door a large blue square. The controls are simple,A and D keys will to shift your weight to tumble and the space bar will make slow motion that will give you greater control when you're in the air. Otherwise your momentum can make you easily miss something. Using slow motion drains the meter and it will build back up over time.Since there's no jump, its all about your momentum, the tumble will make you jump depending on the angle your square hits a surface. To make things interesting there are white anti-gravity cubes that will shift your square's gravity from the bottom to the top of the screen and vise versa. These cubes regenerate in a few seconds.The game benefits the tumbling with platforms that are on angles to tumble or slide down. Trying to move up any incline is a difficult feat that you'll need to shift your square's weight backward before you can shift it forward to have enough momentum to climb. Any over calculation can send you tumbling back down again.If you ever get stuck, just hit R to respawn. There are no lives. It doesn't reset the level, but it does put you back at the start. Any time you die from a death pit a hazard or a respawn, it leaves a dead black square. This makes the level feel alive seeing all your dead squares there. You can move them and bump into them. If you hit them hard enough they'll disintegrate.With the level design, you can make your own way. There's not one clear path to take. Its all about how you take the path you're on. Take one path too slow and you might be stuck. Take another path too fast you might not have the precision it takes to get through it. Levels get more difficult with the inclusion of yellow lines as hazards. One touch and you're dead just like a death pit.From the moment you start, you're in the game, with a quick hub world that lets you tumble to a doorway with continue, act 1, act 2, act 3, bonus and even quit. There's no main menu and it goes a long way to making you feel in game and keeping you there.If you're looking for a hand holding experience you won't find it here. Gravilon is a frustrating game almost from the start. The tumbling mechanic ensures that no attempt is exactly the same and a lot of the time it feels like luck rather than skill. Even when you spawn, its at a different angle, causing you to bounce from there. Your tumble could be off and it might send you somewhere completely different. That's why you need to use the slow motion a lot and even then I felt like I would die again and again. There are no checkpoints, every death restarts the level over again. It wouldn't be an issue if you weren't a tumbling square.To make matters worse your view can get obscured by the previous level. As much as I love the artistic effect it does get annoying. There might not be hand holding, but I don't expect them to cover my eyes either. The game will even turn my level transparent to focus in on the background.Since you can take your own path, you are allowed to keep trying to make the wrong path work. If you can only get the momentum to tumble up high enough you can make this path work! 15 minutes later, its time for a new path. Yet going back to the game, then you can get the momentum to make it work. Again, it feels like luck and not skill. Doing the same thing 100 times might yield the result you want.The beginning of the seventh level has a dead square and with that dead square you can make a path to an anti-gravity cube. Hitting that dead square knocks it out of place, preventing you from using it again on your next attempt, unless you set up your living square then kill it with a retry to have it in place as a dead square. That was my path for a while.The other path I could take is gaining enough momentum, but not too much because you'll knock yourself on a platform or overshoot the needle thin platforms you'll need to slow motion jump to. Then hope you have enough momentum to carry you into the anti-gravity cube or else you'll just have to try again and again. That's just how Gravilon is. You need patience. Your skill will not get you there.Each level can take under two minutes from start to finish and I'm telling you that to inform you that I'm three hours into the game and I have yet to complete the seventh level. I've never made it through the first act. Perhaps that truth is a testament to how bad I am at this game, or its a testament of a game that's a lot like a roll of the dice.Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Its all in the unique tumble mechanic. While it is an unique game with a great art style, its just not fun. Its painful and frustrating, but there are people out there that will love the steep difficulty and soothing atmosphere.The game wouldn't as frustrating if it weren't for the tumbling or even if it gave you a reward; some incentive to continue playing and push through the frustration. Your reward is another level. A game should be fun enough to be its own reward. Maybe there are fun, rewarding bonuses, but three hours and seven levels in, I wasn't able to unlock anything from the bonus content.While I can recommend it for its art style and low price tag, I just can't recommend it as a fun game. Perhaps I found it more frustrating than relaxing. Even if I didn't care for the game, I'd like to thank Fan Wu for giving me the game.			"

												A little interseting at first, but that ended at level two. Bad level design leads to the cube getting stuck in the middle of levels, forcing you to restart them, plus the cube is hard to control and is not very maneuverable. The previous levels get in the way, as in it focuses on the background when you're in emtpy space, bluring everything on your layer. The power meter is not explained, as well as the new objects they add in later levels. The game takes you through 2 launchers, an intro, and an annoying-to-navigate main menu before you even get to play. This game could be good if it was more polished, but I doubt it will get updated. Only get on sale if you want a few trading cards.			"

												Intresting PhysiX engine based game; but leaves a lot to be desired for explaining controls or end goal.  No story or explanations provided, it's box similuator 1.0 (from what I've gathered you start at a level selection screen the goal is to get to the blue box, white boxes invert gravity, the large white box is an exit game, left right movement is a and d space causes momentary slow-motion).  falls short of a good PC game; maybe a good warehouse box kicking idea			"

												This game started out decently, but failed to perform. After the first few levels, it became unreasonably difficult with the unwieldy controls. If you like ridiculously hard platformers and the art style, it could be worth getting for you.			"

												It's very challenging. Haven't played a lot of the later levels yet, but I almost didn't get it because of the 'mixed' reviews. Glad I did, it's worth it if you like a physics-based challenge.As for the controls being difficult, I don't find them much more difficult than a typical platformer. You need to build up momentum to get past a certain point, but not too much otherwise you'll overshoot the next goal - and have to start again.IF YOU RESET during a level, your 'body' stays in the last spot it was in as a part of the environment... that will now affect what you are able to do next... Interesting idea, and very pretty minimalist implementation. Get it if you like a brain-tickle.			"

												What started off as an interesting, albeit not revolutionary or new concept quickly fell off due to its clunky controls and tiresome gameplay.There are a few positive aspects to the game. The different levels are layered in the background, gradually coming to the front whenever the player enters a new level which makes for a nice visual effect and a bit of foreshadowing of what levels are yet to come. The sparse ambient background sound is soothing and the clicky cube bumps are satisfying to hear.Mostly though Gravilon quickly becomes frustrating and a chore to play rather than being fun. One level for example requires the player to either get it right directly or fail subsequently in order to leave a precisely placed ""cube corpse"" boost needed to advance. And there are a lot more instances where hard to anticipate gravity physics interfere with your control over the cube.Gravilon is a hard minimalistic indie platformer and in order to keep the player interested I feel there needs to be something else. It is lacking strong polished controls leaving the gameplay to be just not good enough. I tried getting into Gravilon but failed to keep myself engaged.(Completed 6 levels of 32)			"

												Controls and physics are all janky, and it isn't really that fun of a game. I still play it, but I usually quit a short time after. Sometimes it can be a bit calming though. Ultimately, I think it needs better physics/controls, otherwise the game can seem almost impossible at times.			"

												Gravilon is interesting. I normally hate insanely simple games but. . .  This game is cool. Not going to devote 100s of hours to it, but there are most defiantly worse games out there. Space bar, right and left are what you use to roll your square across things toward the exit. Good stuffNice to look atSmooth controlsChallenging yet simpleBad stuffCheepSimple? Do NOT buy if you're looking for gold haha**Side note for all the negative reviews about the 0 explanation, this game is so simple it doesn't need it.**			"

												I will say this is a unique platformer although a number will likely have to consult a guide for certain stages.Overall this is one of the better minimlist, simplistic platformers with simple but unique mechanics.The simplicity may be a turn off for some but others will find it engaging.

												FirstFor F sake this game is hardis what everybody would say about itSecondFor F sake this game is satisfyingI can't even put into words how much fun i had with itEvery level is sort of a puzzle, we need to find the best path to the exitIt is so much of a weird feeling with most levels when we don't know if we made the curse way it was intendedAnyways i love this game, no matter how hard it is, how unfair, how much split second reaction it needs, I'd so much love to have this 5 hours again to playwith something similarI don't understand the hate game recieved, some people just are too emotionally unstable to keep calmcause this game needs time, effort and thinking, it's not game for everyone.BTW to authors - Is lvl 2.10 the last one, game doesn't allow to pass it and plays back logo and main menu, even if so, cool ending.

												I got this game for a funny meme, If you leave it going you can collect the steam cards and sell them for more than the game when it's on sale.   This is by far the worst game in my library and I'd sooner recommend training a slug to worm it's way into your ear canal.			"
