												Game is novel.  Would suggest having option to steer via trackpads on vive controller as the head tilting isn't sensitive/responsive enough to handle tight corners at high speed.			"

												The game looks like a lot of fun, so I bought it. Big mistake! I started with the ski school and as soon as I was at the bottom of the hill, I was so dizzy. I wound up puking a few seconds later! Really!!!			"

												A fun game! The stick controls are intuitive, but it takes a little time to get used to tilting your head, rather than turning it to turn your body in-game.Once you figure it out though, it's fast, fun, and fairly convincing VR.I felt bit off balance for a moment, but that just made the game more real.

												The controls work well on this, its intuitive with the head turns and didn't have a problem with the Vive controllers.Most enjoyed the slalom levels and is fun taking turns.Feature request: Can we have a leaderboard? It'll be good to compare scores with the community!			"

												Oculus rift user - The gameplay mechanics are poor;  you tilt your head to turn, so your motion does not match what you see and that can be nausea inducing.    Some people will have this problem more than others but I'm downvoting the game mainly for the game not really having much to do even on the higher level.    This review would go positive if they add things to do and allow you to lock in the touch controllers as the ski poles and disable the tilt head turn feature.			"

												Good game - worth the price. Out of all the VR skiing games the graphics in this are the best in my opinion and you get a variety of different pistes. You probably need to develop your 'VR legs' a little to enjoy it. I think it needs another little update to nail down side to side directional movement in VR - this could just be me though! I really hope this game catches on and the developer improves it to absolute perfection - this game has made a good start.			"

			A Massive Thanks to the Developers for the Review Key! Alpine Ski VR is available from Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/553110 My Thoughts: For it's price I'll recommend it and it's...		

For it's price I'll recommend it and it's probably something my kids would love but..... I have to admit I wasn't blow away, I don't know if it's becuase I've been spoiled with other snow based games like 'Edge of Nowhere', 'The Climb' or 'Steep' but I didn't get that VR buzz.The sense of speed was OK, but the graphics were very minimal and bland. I really wanted to like this game more as it's the first time I've tried skiing in VR, and it's a shame it's not in early access so they can add more content and improvements. A bar has been set for VR and sadly I feel this is slightly below it.If this was your very first 'Ever' VR experience then it would be great! However if your a VR vet you'll probably feel a bit let down.			"

Sprint Vector at PAX had me interested in 'runner' type games so I figured I'd give Alpine Ski VR a try.Boy was that a mistake. Where do I start? ....The poles stick directly perpendicular to how they would naturally be held. This is incredibly awkward.Menu selection is all look based. Including the option to reset your camera angle... The reset your camera angle option is pointless if you have to look at the option to select it...The on screen prompts for controls all reference either keyboard or controller buttons. None of them reference Vive buttons.The poles frequently did not make contact with the ground. Especially at the start of a race.I could go on but I'll just say that the game was thoroughly unimpressive on all counts.			"

												While I'm giving this a recommended review I have to say it's still rather early and light on content.  What's there is pretty good but none of the runs (that I've seen anyway) are very long at all.  Since it's a virtual world it would be far better if the runs were super long or even near endless.  Doing the heli-skiing due to the way the mountains are laid out you only get a minute or two of downhill before you hit the bottom of a bowl and have to go back up.I am refunding it but definitely plan to buy it again down the line when it's either finished or closer.  I have a ton of respect for small indie/single developers like this and with what's here now I assume there is a lot more good to come.  While I felt the head tilt works well for carving downhill for me it was far less good for trying jumps and tricks.Looking forward to seeing where this goes.			"

												I'm pretty new to VR and love skiing so thought I'd give this a go. I have to say I was impressed with the skiing model, once you get the hang of turning and jumping it works pretty well. The slalom was fun, but I most enjoyed the freestyle tricks and just exploring and pushing myself round the larger freestyle levels. Leaderboards would make this awesome!			"

												Virtual reality skiing game which is easy to get into and is a nice one for showing friends or VR virgins.  The slalom courses do give a little nausea, but the freestyle slopes are nice. Graphics are not photorealistic, but the game does give a sensation that you are actually on the slopes.
