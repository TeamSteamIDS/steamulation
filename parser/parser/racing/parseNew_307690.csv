												After the 100% completion I can say that:When it comes to visual differences the Definitive Edition features better lighting, character models and textures, some improved world textures, more depth of field, smoke, smoother reflections and visual effects. In short, the game feels more organic.Now you have more people and cars on the screen. I've noticed new faces, different outfits and generally better looks.The keyboard keys were remapped to more standard layout. Notable changes:-RMB to E (entering cars, countering).-Space to L.Shift (sprint and parkour).-RMB now is used for lock-on.The game mechanics are mostly the same. HUD has been slightly revamped, making elements sharper, smaller. Phone's front and UI has been changed completely. Most of the icons have been changed. Main menu has activity feed now and you can switch between social hub entries without the need to wait until they load.The car traffic AI is okay-ish, heavy trucks still scratch the walls on turns, but I've noticed that the AI sometimes keeps crashing into my parked cars. Car physics are semi-buggy. There have been cases of weird spawns and semi floating vehicles.Pedestrian AI needs a bit of polishing. I've experienced bunch of harmless / hilarious bugs and glitches:-Some individuals keep walking into other people as if they were walking into a wall. -Friendly AI had problems entering my car / locating door when needed.-Some thugs were levitating for a brief moment.-Panicking thugs tried to escape, got in a car and kept driving into a wall (they try to back off, but still hit the exact same spot).-Enemy reinforcements sometimes get stuck between cars or they keep looking at you from afar.-Random guy upstairs in Club Bam Bam went through the floor and landed on the ground floor like it was nothing.-Some pedestrian animations keep overwriting themselves (loop too early) and end up looking like they're having a stroke.-Sometimes people get spawned above the water.-Some people get stuck in walls.I've also noticed some audio issues. Sometimes some sound effects aren't played or they randomly appear / disappear. Seems like some audio bits also get either delayed or overlap (especially noticeable if happens during dialogues). Even had 2 radio tracks playing at the same time.I'd like to point out that camera needs tweaking too. Sometimes it doesn't center well, stucks in things or points at wrong angles, has weird sensivity. Especially noticable in action hijacks.I didn't experience these issues in original patched SD.The DLC content is nicely implemented into the main game. You do not get instant access to the items (which would ruin the experience and challenge like in the original SD), instead you can access them in shops (the clothes guy says wacky lines about individual sets), so in-game currency has extra use now. The NANP and YOS side stories are available directly at the main menu, no need to switch between them. The red envelopes are now scattered all around the map and can be found in semi-hidden places. Notable difference: most of the DLC related side missions can only be played once, not including Zodiac island.SWAT Pack DLC's unlimited side missions were turned into ""Cop Job"". No need to travel in a HKPD vehicles, the missions are marked separately on your map and unlock based on your progression. Possible scenarios (possible spoilers):-You raid, beat up and arrest street gangs while having a bunch of officers as a backup.-You're given a vehicle and have to ram the escaping suspect's car, then arrest him.-You respond to store shootouts and neutralize thugs.-Sharpshooting / one shot kill the thug without harming the hostage.There are also some modified individual side missions (possible spoilers):-""High Speed"". Imagine Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. You've given a police car and your goal is to shutdown a race by slamming into racer cars.-Modified ""Death by a Thousand Cuts"". Arena fighting with a golden meat cleaver. Enemies have poisoned weapons and your goal is to survive and kill 30 enemies.  it's quite hardcore, especially if you haven't upgraded anything.-Modified ""Shaolin Showdown"". Defeat 40 monks. Up to 30 on screen.The optimization is even better than in the original. Playable on higher resolutions with less performance hits.Notable difference: you can Alt+Tab freely. The game doesn't go into windowed mode anymore and stays in full screen, there's no need to change options back every time (which was extremely annoying).Final verdict:Worth if you've never (for some reason) played the game before.Otherwise for fans that enjoyed the game.PS. Needs a lot of patching. The bugs add up even if they're semi harmless.I may update this review if we discover some new ""facts"".			"

What is it?A story-driven action adventure set in a gorgeously recreated Hong Kong setting (a mix of various Hong Kong sectors fairly accurately recreated).  The game is based on real events (though names have been changed).  You are Wei Shen, and you lead a double life as a Triad gang member and an undercover cop - so you will be playing both sides of the story.  It is Wei's job to bring down the Sun On Yee gang (a tweaked name of the real-life 'Sun Yee On') from the inside, and so he must find a way in, and get people to trust him.  Soon, Wei starts to feel divided loyalties as he gets in deeper and deeper.  The main storyline is linear but the plot is fast-paced and entertaining.  There are masses of side missions that fit in with the plot very well and you can choose when and if to play these. Sleeping Dogs contains all the usual open-world elements we love: a gorgeously atmospheric and thriving city densely populated with people and traffic, great ambience (especially the night market), vehicles to unlock and drive (or simply steal), USEFUL collectibles that either upgrade your health and strength, or your bank balance!  Is it easy to play?Very.  The driving and parkour elements are simple and responsive and the martial arts moves are only taught gradually and are not overly complex, though you might find yourself scribbling down a few moves as there are ultimately 12 to remember!  The game's tuition system spreads your learnt moves gradually through the game using a novel system of returning to Wei's former Kung Fu school.  For exchange of each school's missing trophies, you will be taught a new move and given some non-aggressive adversaries to practise it on.  It works very well.  As for weapons combat, I personally found it easier to switch to mouse for aiming, but the game switches seamlessly between controllers while playing.  The only negative aspect is the sometimes-uncontrollable camera angles after reversing a vehicle.  The camera is too slow to face forward, meaning you often start driving blindly.  Other than this, everything is great.RequirementsRegarding game requirements, you really will need to pay attention to those because this is a heavy game graphically.  There is some stutter in the cut-scenes regardless of GPU but the cut-scenes are only occasional.  You will benefit greatly from a gamepad.  This is not the sort of game for people who have a 'delicate' audience in the room as there is a lot of 'colourful' language and such.    If you're a female gamer, you'll probably cringe at some of the lines spoken by some women (some are really bad!) - but not enough to kill enjoyment of the game.Is it worth upgrading from the original?If you enjoyed the game enough that you'd likely play it through again, then I'd say yes.  It looked great before but there are a plethora of improvements: denser NPCs and traffic, heaps more variety in shop signs, lots more lit signs, beautiful environment effects, super-realistic road and building textures and improved controls.  A few bugs in the original game have been fixed, and all the cars, outfits, apartments and cash DLC is no longer automatically awarded to you at the beginning of the game (a problem with the original version, leaving players with nothing further to play for).  The only caution is that, if your PC struggled a bit with the original, it will struggle more with this version given that it is a much heavier game for your GPU.			"

												Sleeping Dogs is a nice blend of several different game genres, and while none of them are anything new or groundbreaking, everything generally played well. The original (non-definitive) version is one of the few games I have 100% completion on in my steam library.Since you can read up on pretty much any review for the actual game, I thought I'd focus on what's new for this re-release.The biggest improvement probably went into how the dlc was handled. Every single dlc (with the exception of the top dog booster packs) is now included, and rather than just dumping them all on you at once, they were all was integrated into the game a little better, unlocking a few pieces from each as you progress through the story. While some of the changes are minor, like a new vendor in the night market who sells some of the dlc costumes, they actually went back and tweaked a few of them to flow better. For example, the ""Shaolin Showdown"" side mission is no longer an endless arena where you fight until you die, but now has you running to several locations fighting smaller groups of enemies, eventually climaxing into one of the largest melee fights in the entire game. The Swat dlc missions were also changed into individual ""Cop missions"" that feel like they have a little more variety now and unlock over time instead of all at once. In fact, almost every mission got some sort of small tweak to it. However, Nightmare in North Point and Year of the Snake are still separate standalone stories that don't take your progress in the main story into account (though they both still unlock a few bonus items for the story when completed).The graphics also got a bit of an upgrade, though it's not immediately obvious because the original PC game was already a big improvement over the 360/ps3 versions. Mostly, everything now has even higher-resolution textures, and there are some new effects like fog in the streets, remodeled skin and hair for most characters that looks great in cutscenes, more dense vehicle and pedestrian traffic, and some new outdoor effects. In particular, the new rain effect (and the puddles it leaves on the street) looks fantastic.If you never played Sleeping Dogs, you really owe it to yourself to pick up this re-release, as it fixes some of the flaws of the original and includes all the dlc. However, if you already played the original and most of its dlc, you should probably skip this. Improvements and dlc aside, there is no new content (mission or story-wise) whatsoever.			"

												Because this is the same exact game as Sleeping dogs, my review for this game is also the same copy pasted text except now it's in 1080p high definition letters.Seriously if you own the original game and all the DLC's do not buy this one. If you don't own this game, buy it, it's amazing.Wonderful game. Looks like GTA and Yakuza had a child and it’s turned out to be awesome.Sleeping dogs owns GTA4 in every way. I was forcing myself to finish GTA4 and enjoyed Sleeping dogs twice (on PS3 and after couple of years on Steam) and even collected all the achievements.Firstly the graphics are much better, GTA4 looks like crap and sleeping dogs looks great and when it’s start to rain it looks amazing. Sleeping dogs runs much MUCH better too while GTA4 is barely playable and bad looking even on high end machines.The gameplay is much more fun than broken GTA4, where controls are pathetic, shooting is frustrating, cars are bouncing, etc. This is not existent in Sleeping dogs. Controls are really good except for some rare camera issues. Driving is fun, especially shooting while driving and hijacking. And shooting mechanics is great, it’s easy to target the enemy, shoot him in the head, hide behind cover or disarm the enemy.The fighting system, is something like Yakuza. There are some combos which you learn by levelling up, you can use environment and knives, cleavers or even umbrellas, purses and my favourite – a fish to kill people. Side missions are not boring unlike in some other games, most of them are different every time. Catching the thieves, throwing out the drunks from the shop, collecting debts, stealing cars or find the lady in a car’s trunk and free her only to find out that it’s some sexual game and she was waiting for her husband to find her, not you.The story is good too. As undercover cop you must infiltrate the triad and bring them down. So you play as a cop and as a gangster depending on the mission. Sometimes it’s just driving, sometimes fighting or some bloody shootout.Oh and the game have radio with a different genre of music. My favourite is roadrunner records station. It has such bands like Machine head, Dream theatre, Soulfly and Trivium. It’s really fun to kick some teeth while Fear factory’s edgecrusher is playing :) The only downside of this game for me is that it lacks activities. After playing Yakuza games which has a bunch of activities I want more of them in other games too. The only activities are ♥♥♥♥ fights, races and mah-jong. Because of this I’m giving this game 9/10 :)			"

												Pros:- Beautiful scenery, especially at night- FIghting mechanics are great (not limited to buton mashing)- Cool vehicles- Crazy physics- Massage parlours- Pork buns (to become a whole man)- Night markets (they even simulate the annoying pestering of DVD sellers wow)- Enables players to be fluent in Cantonese swearing- Cool old chinese instrumental music when you enter the dojo (my mum once told me to stop playing to just let her listen to the music, which made me leave Wei Shen staring at those 4 dudes awkwardly while the music played)Cons:- The scenery sometimes seem to be a bit blurry but not too blurry to turn you off tho- Hot girls you can't have sex with (dammit)Overall, I love the game, love the missions, love how intense the gameplay is even though we have to admit they're pretty cliche from time to time...If you live in a family that understands Cantonese, please wear headphones while you're playing this game.You wouldn't want the kids in your house to start saying ""diu lei lou mou"" and ""ham ka chan"" and ""pok gai"", trust me.So no h8 m8 i r8 this game 8/8			"

												(Review simply based on additions and improvements, not the game itself.)- Improved Graphics- Sharper looking text and interface- Increased the ammount of pedestrians and cars- Pedestrians now look a lot more varied (alternate clothes, different faces)- All DLC's included- Sound and audio has improved- Physics has improved- Driving is smoother- Special places to buy DLC outfits- New billboards and signs seen around the city- City feels more alive (More people eating in the Golden Koi, people taking photo's, police investigating crime scenes, etc)The only cons I have seen so far are not game breaking but as follows;- Tiny glitches such as people and objects stay static in the air for a few seconds if hit- Cars seem to crash into you more often even when parkedThe game is a nicely polished version of the original. Mostly for fans of the original game who want to up their experience a little or for those who want all the DLC for a decent price. Either way, fantastic game made better.			"

												I only bought this game, because I live in Shanghai and I thought it would be nice to play a GTA-like game in an environment I'm familiar with. The city in this game is Hong Kong only in name. The city itself does not look like Hong Kong at all (I travel to HK a lot so I would know), so this might as well be Shanghai. The attention to detail in this game is mind blowing. I mean, sure the game elements (story, gameplay, fighting, racing, etc) are fine and entertaining, but what I really like the most about this game are the people. The main characters and especially the people on the street are so authentic and believable! I just love it! From obvious chanting of the street vendors to the not so obvious nose drilling sound before spitting, loud chewing with open mouth or the way people talk (even if translated into English). This is just my personal opinion of the game. If you are Chinese or if you have visited Hong Kong/Shanghai, get this game and have a good time! But since there's a better choice (GTAV), get this game when it's on sale. By now the full price is not worth it.

												Look at Watch Dogs. Now at this game. Now back to Watch Dogs. Now back to this game. Sadly Watch Dogs aren't nearly as well-optimized, while offering marginally (very marginally) better graphical fidelity. Also Watch Dogs doesn't have an amazingly authentic city of Hong Kong with TONS of cultural education content. Neither does it have an interesting unique combat system, phenomenal voice acting, great satisfying driving with action hijacking, actually meaningful and clever hacking minigame (ironic, right?), a lot of variety in mission types and gameplay and a good storyline with actual emotions and some seriously shocking scenes.Sleeping Dogs Definitive edition is definitely a definitive Open World Action game in a well-defined location, with a defiant for the genre, yet great combat system and the very definition of what a GTA-style game should be. Definitely. Incredible game. EFG have delivered in full. Wholeheartedly recommend.			"

												""That is what worries me, Wei. That you have become one of them.""As the store page for the vanilla game is only available for the DLCs it's best to summarise what Sleeping Dogs is for the newcomers. In case you only wish to know what the Definitive Edition can offer please scroll down further where I detail its characteristics.Sleeping Dogs, in essence, is GTA in Hong Kong. You have a living, breathing city with hundreds of pedestrians, drivers and bad guys. Into this world comes Wei Shen, an undercover cop so that he can infiltrate the triads and end their reign once and for all. You are free to go wherever you wish in the city. Once you approach shining beacons at certain spots a mission is initiated which is introduced by a cutscene. This is the linear, the story part of the game and once a mission is complete you are back in Hong Kong where you can participate in racing events, do favors for citizens, bet in a cockfight, hack cameras, complete missions for the police, purchase clothing and vehicles. The activities are numerous not to mention the many collectibles scattered throughout the city: you can pay your respects at health shrines, collect lockboxes and red envelopes full of cash and you can look for jade statues to learn new moves from your old kung fu master. Oh, and you can date girls and participate in karaoke sessions, as well!The story of Wei Shen is excellent and full of intrigue, treachery and some surprises. Voice acting is excellent but why would anyone think differently: as soon as you hear the voice of Tom Wilkinson or James Hong you know the game will deliver! As opposed to GTA, in Sleeping Dogs emphasis is on the melee combat (attacks, heavy attacks and counters - rinse and repeat) but from time to time you can get hold of several firearms, too. I like how you can utilise the environment to ease a battle: enemies can be thrown into dumpsters or into a whirling fan where they are met with gruesome death. Both combat and car handling are smooth and fast!The 2 DLC stories that can be accessed from the main menu do not offer anything interesting, however, putting these aside in-game content requires you to devote at least 30-40 hours if you wish to reach 100% completion.The Definitive Edition:-- This edition gives you the full package with all DLCs included. Red envelopes are put elsewhere and some missions have been changed. In fact, the DLC clothing are now sold by a special vendor near the market area. Perhaps the most notable of this inclusion are the unique cop missions where you always assist your fellow officers (you need to hit and ram enemy vehicles or gun down bad guys or save a hostage).-- The game has better effects and higher resolution textures. Or so they say. The former are noticeable and for a city known for its ""light pollution"" it is a must, to be honest. In fact, there are more pedestrians on the streets so you can really feel being in Hong Kong.-- With all the graphics enhancements the game is still not demanding much: 60 FPS result is common, in fact, the game runs better on my rig than the original version did.-- With new features come new bugs: audio issues (overlapping) here and there and due to the more NPCs on the streets you notice more of them get stuck at certain places for no apparent reason. Still, these are all minor nuances.-- The game now has better keybindings. I know these can be changed in the controls menu but I always appreciate if the developers pick the applicable buttons per default. This layout now makes more sense.To use a pun I am happy to say this edition is a definitive must! As I had already had the vanilla game in my library I got a 50% special promotion for this super package - I believe this is nice so for me this edition was an immediate purchase.			"

The streets of Honk Kong are too narrow and crowded for proper racing, sure it's illegal racing but come on...at least remove the cars and breakeable entities for a proper racing track? Damn-Minor bugs, easily fixable, doesn't mean they can't be annoyingConclusionIf you can overlook the bugs and bloke driving system the game is great and intense, I highly recommend this game for those who played GTA and likes some good ol' fighting :3			"

												This game is really good this second time around!!! Updated shaders and materials and a lot of optimizations have been made for better performance. (Higher Framerates, etc.)Gameplay Pros: - Parkour - Street races - A very interesting story (nothing totally original, but good) - Fun combat situations - Ka-ra-tay - Decent selection of cars to buy and driveGameplay Cons: - Annoying car physics, I say this because when you hit a cardboard box on the side of the road, the entire front of your car is mangled. The cars handling is ok... It's really how they deal damage and how they act on the road. (Ex: Pot hole = Fly into a doom pit pretty much) - Dialog, when a bad guy talks in a cut scene *SPOILER* Like when ""Smiley's"" men attack the Golden Koi, the gangster has a gun on Ms. Chu, his dialog makes you want to laugh... it's like ""FAK YU BICK I GOTTA FIE DALLA YU GIB ME DA SHET.""   xD - WHY PEGGY.

												Sleeping Dogs is one of those rare games that everybody loves, and every recommend to each other, but somehow no one has ever played it ( as far as you know).So I picked it up during a sale after it had been sitting on my wish list for a long time, and wow. I get it now.Sleeping Dogs is an incredible open world game, unique, lovingly crafted, and expertly written. Does it have its faults? Of course it does, as any game does, but the risks it takes, and the ways it succeeds far outweigh any nitpicking.Protagonist Wei Shen is an interesting, layered, and complex main character, in a world and surrounded by characters that are just as complex as he is.The story about Hong-Kong Triads is very well done, and every character has so much personality, that you stay curious about how the story will unfold.I personally still haven't finished the main storyline because I simply don't want it to end. I treat myself to a story mission every now and then, like a delicious slice of cake on the weekend. But while the story itself is quite serious, as gangsters usually are, the story does make plenty of room for a bit of humor, and especially nods to Hong Kong action movies. The combat is unique and fun, the world vibrant and interesting, the characters complex, the story great.Please play Sleeping Dogs, so you can start recommending it to your friends who will also wait months to actually do so, like you did.

												This game deserves a proper sequel, one of the most underrated games in my opinion.+ Great story with a lot of twists and turns that will keep you hooked to the end.+ Amazing fighting mechanics that feels very fluent, with plenty of combos to unlock.+ Beautiful recreation of Hong Kong.+ The city feels alive with plenty of pedestrians doing different things like working and holding conversations.+ Great side missions that also has some interesting storylines.+ Fun DLCs.+ Fun mini games and such to do on the side.+ great feeling of progression as you unlock better safehouses and cars and clothes with time.+ Great and memorable characters+ Nice voice actingThis game went through ""development hell"" as it was first being developed as ""True Crime: Hong Kong"" by Activision but was later sold to Square Enix, but even though it went trough some drastic changes I couldn't ask for more from any game. Sure it has flaws like any other game, and things they could have done better, but at the end of the day it is a fantastic game. "

												You heard the story of Wei Shen! But now, hear it again, only it is prettier now! Like way prettier, also all the hair is all soft and moving and his jackets have little doodads and his clothes have physics that weren't there the first time! Also, now the DLC is all integrated into the game and the DLC missions show up at story-appropriate times, and DLC outfits and content is slowly distributed throughout the game in a way that is much more satisfying! No more will you turn on the game and get some weird pop-up about how now you can dress up like some old guy from MMA and also you have lots of money and points! Now you will have to quest to look like that old guy from MMA (I think, I don't really know who that guy is?).If you have seen the protests on television, then you will know the government doesn't want you to Occupy Central! Don't give in! With Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition, you can digitally Occupy Central and show your solidarity. Wei Shen supports freedom and self-determination, you should too!			"

												ill keep it simple*City now looks almosty smoggy all the time esp noticable at night, color pallet is a tad different in places to reflect this. *Npc and cars have more variety and look a bit better. *General astectics look better, like vendors, shops, debrie, steam and smoke etc*More distructible objects, *Better reflections and the main characters skin and clothing looks far less plastic like and only shines when wet or bloodyAll in all everything looks more gritty and dirty in a good kind of way however if you already own the original and its dlcs  i cant honestly say its enough of a change to bother getting and i find it runs a fair bit worse for me than the original. None the less despite what has been said it does not look worse, its a matter of realism and taste really.Basically if you dont have it its a good version to own, otherwise meh.			"

												I've already played through this twice and hit almost 100% completion, and I still find myself coming back to this amazing game.Sleeping Dogs is a fun and action packed game with a brilliant story, and a great setting, although at some points it's mechanics let it down.Story:In Sleeping Dogs, you will control Wei Shen, an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating one of the Hong Kong triads and bringing it down from the inside. Wei himself is mostly a pretty forgettable character, and is not really shown to have many major flaws. He is tough and intelligent, and is essentially a perfect human, to a borderline unrealistic point. The story does not so much shine in all its characters as much as it does with its excellent moral conflict as Wei begins to be torn between whether or not he wishes to destroy the gang he works himself into, and in my opinion the story is one of the best aspects of Sleeping Dogs, and is a main reason I continue to return to the game. Setting:While the map may be a tad small compared to many open world games, the way the streets are constructed, the sound effects, and the whole atmosphere really creates a rich setting which at least to me, never gets boring. Hong Kong is essentially a necessary part of the game due to its focus on the triads, and even though it's quite small, what they do have is done just right. While I haven't personally been to HK, a friend of mine has said that it does in fact look like the real city.Graphics:Sleeping Dogs is a beautiful game, especially considering how it isn't exactly too new. Some of the textures aren't too great, and often the characters seem to shine like they'd been polished, but leaving the games apartment and walking out onto a street at dusk just after some rain still never ceases to amaze me.Music:The original soundtrack in Sleeping Dogs, for me, isn't really anything special. It certainly isn't bad, it just isn't really unique enough to stand out. The radio songs on the other hand, really hit the mark, particularly in my opinion on stations such as Softly or Warp Radio. I never get sick of just driving around the city listening to the music.Gameplay:While Sleeping Dogs on the surface may look a bit similar to GTA, it is in fact quite different, something which is both a positive and a negative. On the plus side, Sleeping Dogs' hand to hand combat is very well done. While it is spammy if you want it to be, the range of options you have at your disposal means that the combat doesn't get boring no matter how many fights you are in. A downside to this combat is the presence of firearms. Guns are not introduced until about 30% through the campaign, and even once introduced you would be hard pressed to obtain one outside of a campaign mission. There is not traditional weapon select as there is in many open world games, instead you are able to carry one small firearm stored in your pocket, but that firearm does not persist between missions meaning that if you had a pistol in your pocket and then do a mission, likely that pistol will have despawned again once you re-enter the open world. The general lack of guns in Sleeping Dogs is not necessarily a bad thing however, because the guns you can use are in all honestly not always that fun. They do not really feel as satisfying as guns in, say, GTA do, particularly due to the lack of variation. While slow motion cover vaulting or quick disarms are fun, the gunplay itself is often quite lacklustre in my opinion, meaning don't come to Sleeping Dogs looking for a great shooter.Perhaps my least favourite mechanic out of the whole game is it's driving. Cars in Sleeping Dogs handle terribly. Steering is not smooth, handbrakes are a joke, and the reversing camera is just plain bad. The redeeming feature of vehicles is the ability to jump from one to another. Despite how unrealistic doing this is, it is still satisfying to jump from one car to another in slow motion.Overall, Sleeping Dogs is perhaps one of my favourite games of all time. It has an excellently told story taking place in a rich and atmospheric world with great visuals. The melee combat is deep and satisfying, even though guns and driving fall off a little, making Sleeping Dogs essentially a must for any fans of a good tale.			"

												An honestly great game that is often overlooked by most gamers. An undercover cop brawler set in Hong Kong is an awesome concept and thankfully the game does delivers on that promise. The story is gripping as you get to know the local thugs and have conflicting feelings along the way. There are many twists and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. But if you are ever tired of main story, the side missions are very enjoyable as well.  The combat is okay, but makes up for it with exciting enviromental takedowns and a fun driving system. If you ever have one of those days where you are feeling down, this game will lighten up your day with its fun sandbox.			"

												So here is my opinion regarding this game:Pros:+Very good combat system+Nice driving mechanics (for cars, buses and boats)+Car chases are very fun+Graphics are good+Good story+Likeable characters (you can feel the protagonist anger in you)+Good experience system+Destructible environment+Good voice acting+Full of content+DLCs are useful (dat triad car) and some of them add to the character developmentCons-Some performance issues-Antialiasing always enabled-The motorcycle driving isn't very good and it feels like you have no control at higher speeds-Pedestrians AI is a bit dumb-Every driver has a tendency to crash in youMisc+/- The siren on the police car, when on, doesn't do anything. Drivers don't get out from your way and neither pedestrians. But it looks really nice+/- A bit hard to maintain your cop score on the main missions, but the experience is easy to gain from side missions.A well done game. Definetly a 8.5-9/10. I can recommend it.			"

												Possibly one of the most underrated open world games ever released. The story is decent, but the fighting mechanics are lovingly crafted and feel weighty and brutal. Arcade-style driving, ramming, and shooting make car chases feel like less of a chore than in GTA games. Great for open world fans, even better for kung-fu movie fans.			"

												Forward note! For my opinion on the Sleeping Dogs in general, I assure you I'm a fan. I've bought the game triple times now, and my disregard about ""definitive edition"" concerning only how little I got, paying for the game that third time. You can see my review on the Sleeping dogs there: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/202170/In short, if you have the Sleeping dogs game already, you don't need to buy that ""Definitive edition"".  But if you've missed it earlier - don't wait until it's become completely obsolete, give it a shot!What is new in ""Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition""? Well, there are many small things redistributed here and there, mostly to the better. Example: there was a bind to the right mouse button, so if you click it while driving, Wei Shen jumps off the venicle with the gun ready, in slow-mo, of course. Cool feature, very cinematographic, but almost never used. I remember more than dozen times in the original Sleeping dogs when I occasionally clicking that button in the middle of the chase... and have to restart all sequence. Because of the one stupid button binding. Good news: they fixed it in ""Definitive edition""! Sweet? Yeah, for sure!But hey, key binding is a very small thing, do we really need to buy all the game once more to have normal controls?Sorry, if I'm talking too long, but I'm gonna give you a full comparison of the two products now, so if you're not ready to read it all, goto 10, or skip to the bottom.Like I said earlier, developers of Sleeping dogs redistributed all the secondary stuff in the game. That means that original game, all its mechanics, practically all its glitches - remained the same. Remember dying in the ""Election"" mission in jumping sequence? It's remained the same. Stupid taxi mappings? There. And so on. Yep, if we take a general look, they refurbished some textures. But that was made with great price of tossing away all 32-bit systems. ""VIP only"" now! But if you ask me, if the game looking better now, I'll answer ""No, it remained almost where it was. You'll not see the difference even if you try to"".All about secondary stuff, that's it. Notorious DLC. Now, in the Definitive edition, they seems much more logically connected with the main story. Side missions appears connected with the main quest progress, experience they giving now is not enough to quick levelling. All is much more fair now. And dull. And dumb. See, from the first place, the main story itself is not logical and well-implemented with the real (or cinematographic) Hong Kong. It is not a comic book, thank God, but very close to it - naive, sketchy and simplesized. Was made that way to fit ""normal"" user, of course.What I'm trying to say there is that all that developers gain in logic and balance, they lose in general fun out of the game. Take a Retro-Triad suit for example. In general sense, Wei Shen cannot wear a suit like that no matter what. It is not fit into story. Yet, it is fun to wear. So it exist. But there's a difference. In the ""old edition"" you can wear some (any) parts of that suit separately. I, for example, liked gloves. Someone liked the haircut (yeah, it's part of the suit). So everyone could pick it's own look. Sorry, but no more. If you want Retro-Triad suit, it's there, but only as whole. Makes even less sense than it was before.Let me put it once again:+ Added some high-res textures for graphics freaks. Still not comparable with the Rockstar product, though.+ All DLC, all the seconadary stuff now structurized and appears with the progress of the main quest.+ Some new missions were added! They are quite short and linear, but new is a new!+ Some small glitches and questionable game features was fixed- Owners of 32-bit windows systems now aren't supported. What is more, new graphics features requires a tricky manual tuning to work properly (at least, for PC with two graphics systems, like the most of gaming notebooks)- Implementation of the DLC made some of them very limited. You cannot divide costumes, you cannot beat monks in the temple multiple times, ""death by a thousand cuts"" mission now limited to 30 enemies and one go through (and what a good skirmish it was before! sob)- Some major game glithes and disadvantages remains (like the falling from the ramp in ""the Election"" mission or people stucking in walls)I'd praised all the fixes were they a simple update to the existing game. But paying once again for the very same story with the very same experience and bugs? That's rip-off!			"

TL;DR:Spiritual successor to the ""TRUE CRIME"" open world games, Sleeping Dogs is such a HUGE step on improvements in every aspects of the past series. Solid story, great gameplay, decent visuals and voice acting! Highly recommended for every gamers who love open-world GTA style games!The definitive edition brings every released DLC on the vanilla edition into this edition. There is claims of improved visuals and other aspects but I cannot confirm nor deny these allegations as I barely played the ""normal"" edition.PROS:+Solid story+Great and savage melee combat+Fun driving and gunplay+Big variety in missions+Good visuals and voice acting.+Many collectibles to hunt down and other enjoyable diversions (if that is your sort of thing) but for once, these collectibles are actually handy. In exemple, I suggest you do all the races then some special three-way missions unlock so you can work upon getting the best ""experimental"" car in the game. VERY HANDY!+I played this game with keyboard and mouse and the controls were solid throughout the whole game. +Game supports 21:9 ultrawide resolutions and everything was perfect on it!+Sleeping Dogs ran without any problems, tech issues or game breaking bugs. There was a few instances that the game had frozen objectives and only way for fixing it was reloading the checkpoint. Aside from that, no issues whatsoever!CONS: -Wonky driving camera as it always auto-resets itself and there is no way to disable it. -There would also be some minor cons like the lack of plane/helicopter piloting since in SD, you only drive cars and boats.-Radio soundtrack is average, with a few good licenced songs on different radio stations. They can't beat GTA in that department.RECOMMENDATION:I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fan of open-world type games similar to GTA. You will love this game!...CLOSUREA few months ago, it was confirmed that the Canadian developing studio behind Sleeping Dogs closed down. Such a big shame... Game of this quality deserved more sequels and I was very saddened to hear of that bad news. I'm not sure if the MMO-type Sleeping Dogs that was in production was one of the reason for the downfall since mostly every fans only wanted a true sequel instead but no one will know for sure.I really wish the best to the devs that worked at UNITED FRONT GAMES!

												Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is often referred to as the Chinese/Japanese GTA. I hope that we can put this common misconception aside and look at this game as it is. The game brings so much more to the table. It has a hacking system, good melee combat , free running, mahjong poker, classical music & chinese pop on the radio and even karaoke. That's not the surprising part, the surprising part to me was that it brought as much as GTA IV and combine it with so much more side stuff. To give you an idea how much there is, there is about 30% story and the rest of it is all side stuff. And when you are thinking that you are done with everything you can call contacts to unlock even more side content, at the moment 32 hours in, I did just about did half of the whole package.The fighting system is both smooth on keyboard and mouse as it is on controller. The main fighting style in the city is kung fu, and anyone seems to master it, and the game loves to shed light upon this style to make players use it . What I mean with that is that gun fights are going to be there but they are going to be scarce. There are loads of combinations to unlock in fighting to make you even more of a powerhouse. They even added realistic sounds to the fighting, whenever we are doing a finisher which is breaking an arm for example sounded so realistic that it reminded me from when I dislocated my shoulder. It sounded so similar that I got goose bumps from it. Some kinds of fighters grab you from behind and hold you in a uncomfortable position to escape from but it is so hard to escape from that it's annoying. Another minor disadvantage is that the heavy and weak attack is set to the same key which I thought made the combinations a bit harder than they should be.The story starts off pretty straight forward and linear but eventually I got attached to the main character as you get to understand him. You play Wei Shen, a returning Hong Kong citizen, which had connections with the Sun On Yee triads from his childhood. Upon his return he got arrested because of crimes he commited in the United States. Since he has connections to the triads he has to infiltrate into the gang and destroy the gang from inside out. This includes betrayal, killing, investigations on people and even hacking to achieve your goal. Most of the side mission also are about the police work you can do. The main character really was well fit into the story, most of the time you could not even tell if he was instinctivily making decisions in the gang or he was doing it to succeed in his mission to destroy the gang. In the end the story takes a few interesting turns which came out of nowhere but it turned out very good. In the past you could buy the version without the DLC's but I looked into it and they seemed mandatory since that version is not available anymore. There are two extra stories, obviously smaller than the main story.The first DLC is called Nightmare in North Point which is set after the main story as a horror story. It includes ancient Chinese myths like the Jiang Shi folklore. The combat is also pretty engaging because every fight gets more intense with an extra difficulty added. For me this DLC is equally good content as the main story.The second DLC is called Year of the Snake which is set right before Chinese New Year. Here you have to do cop work to defeat a terrorist cult trying to bomb the city and most of it's citizens. It was more of a cat and mouse game than the suposed investigation on the cult. Some of the missions initiated with searching within an area which was just as easy as finding the odd looking guys in special suits. I wish they had made that more intense. What I also noticed is that unlike in the main story of the first DLC is that Wei was very quiet which I did not like, I would have loved some conversations even if it just was filler.All in all a real thrill to play and even worth trying out if you favor GTA above anything. If the fighting style sounds like you would enjoy it or enjoy the combination they pulled off with the police work and the triad crimes you really should try out this game. However you shouldn't pick this up if you do not prefer melee combat.			"

												Like GTA, but you're an undercover cop in Hong Kong investigating the Triads.  There isn't nearly as wide a variety of side activities as in GTA (ex. you won't be playing golf), but there are numerous side missions, races and cop jobs in addition to the 15-hour storyline.  The story and voice-acting are well done, though I did run into 2 or 3 audio bugs over the course of the game.  The camera feels a bit sluggish when using a gamepad, but for the most part the controls are solid.If you enjoy just racking up stars and avoiding arrests in GTA, or generally causing mayhem, this won't have the same appeal.  But if you like open world games with a focused narrative, this game kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												LUV DIS GAME MORE THAN GTA5.In GTA5, you will be imediately wanted for killing 2 people in the wilderness where it looks like there's no signal at all. YEAH, VERY REALISTIC.In Sleeping Dogs, you can kill the entire people in the nightmarket. And ram police car into trash to avoid the arrest. This is called a one-man slaughter. THIS IS A CRIME-THEMED GAME !!!! In GTA5, you carry a load of firearms and draw from nowhere. YEAH, VERY REALISTIC.In Sleeping Dogs, weapons and firearms are not very necessary. Your body is the primary weapon against the thugs. The mixed martial arts used by Wei will make you feel breathtaking. Highly recommend this game if you're into crime-themed ones.			"

												This and Far Cry 3 are probably the 2 games I enjoyed the most in the last 2 or 3 years.You get to play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop joining the Triads in Hong Kong, Armed with guns, swords, fish (yes fish), knives and some awesome martial arts skills you get to kick A** around Kong Kong.I wont get in to the background story as its available on the store page but i will say this is much more than a GTA clone, the gameplay, the story, and especially the location all give this game its own identity. I visit Far Eastern Asia twice a year and playing this made me want to go back sooner, it also reminded me of home a little with the once British influence of HK, especially the roads and transport.I didnt want this game to end and when it did I started it again.10/10 Hoping they make another			"

												Just as good as the original Sleeping Dogs - so about 35-40 hours of quality open-world action. This version has slightly better graphics, some new minor missions and overall better balance (the game is a bit harder since you don't start with all the booster packs as was the case with the original release). I was happy to re-play this gem.			"

												This game is absolutely brilliant. The gameplay - especially the fighting style is terrfic. The counter system is something unique. The story is great as well and the game offers a completely new experience. It's a game worth every single penny you pay. $30 for such a great game is very very very cheap. Before I bought the game, I read that the cutscenes were a bit laggy but there's no such thing here (maybe they fixed it or whatever).Scores a 9/10 for me (and my brother who persuaded me to buy it lol).

												This game was truly a surprise for me . I had doubts about how it'd stack up against the GTA and Saints Row series but it surprised me with its atmosphere and combat . Hands Down , this game has THE most atmospheric CITY in any game i've ever played .  The city feels truly authentic . This is true HONG KONG . The shooting in this game is kinda clunky but who cares when you can go Bruce lee on everybody's asses . Guns are  for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ . The definitive edition comes with a huge graphical overhaul and all the DLC and its very Cheap ! My advice - Why are you still reading this ? just get it !			"

												Sleeping Dogs the Definitive Edition is a great rebranding of the original game. It updates the parkour and combat system with slightly new controls and in my opinion more response from the original. The driving has been improved by alot the only thing they didnt spiff up a bit was the camera controls while driving which can still be a pain in some situations. As for the textures and update models I will say the graphics haven't been updated that much but the increased models makes the enviroment feel a little bit more immersive. Now for the DLC which I feel is done the right way in this game as opposed to the original where it was all handed to you the second you step into your apartment and you become the endgame badass on mission 2. All the clothing has been added to a Legendary Vendor, police vehicles and equipment is achieved by finishing cop jobs, cars and other clothing is all unlocked via finishing missions/side content and the zodiac tournament. If you haven't yet played this game this is definetly a great buy having the whole game and DLC's in one with update mechanics and improved code for a much more stable playing experience. If you have the original game but not all the DLC's and you were a fan of this game you'll love it all over again. 9/10.			"

												As a hongkonger myself, i can say that many of the aspects in this game are spot-on, e.g. the phone booths and some stickers on the walls etc. The cantonese is also perfect, which is rare in games. Only thing that annoys me is that the roads and the places are all in the wrong place, and the city doesnt look like Hong Kong in some places. Still a bloody nice game though.			"

Since the recent closure of United Front Games, I decided to make a review of what I consider their masterpiece, Sleeping Dogs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sleeping Dogs, originally released in 2012 was a shock for me. I didn't like a single thing about True Crime (Sleeping Dogs originally was a True Crime sequel), and I was ignoring it from the announcement until the release. Then, days after release, I got a copy of the game for PS3, since I was curious to see the reason of all those great review scores that it was getting, and decided to try and I was impressed with everything. Hong Kong lives in the game, UFG really made a amazing recreation of it. The story was good, and even more if we take the open-world genre in account, it's not a mind blowing tale, but for it's genre, it's quite well built, graphics were very good, and so the soundtrack.After I finished it, I decided to wait for the DLCs to play it again but I ended just skipping it. However, sometime ago Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition was in a sale on Steam and I jumped for it, and honestly, I don't regret a single bit. Damn, I could have bought it for the full price and I still wouldn't regret.First, the PC port is good. We have some graphics options, like AA, shadows quality, motion blur, and full support to 60FPS/1080p+, and this is nice. Also, the Definitive Edition fortunately don't make you overpowered from the start (the original game had a lot of DLCs to get fast upgrades, cars, money and more), and this is great. Also, I played it for long sections without a single crash or breaking bug, another good point. The graphics are okay for today standards.Talking about the story again, it's not the greatest story ever told, but I enjoyed it. We're playing as the undercover cop Wei Shen, that came back from the USA to work in HKPD, his mission is to infiltrate and weaken one of the triads that run the town, called Sun on Yee (based off on the real HK triad, Sun Yee On). Before leaving Hong Kong for the first time, Wei had contacts within the triad, with made his job easier and as him complete jobs for his leader, Winston Chu, he turns in a very important member. After some events, himself turns in a SoY leader and begin to question his boss in the police. Overall, it's predictable (with the exceptions of some events that really took me in surprise), but it's good, well made, of course, it has some fails and holes, like for example, back in the start of the game, there's almost no guns at all. Then close to the ending, almost every mission will involve a gunfight. Also, some characters, like Sonny Wu, that ends doing a big part on the game, weren't developed at all. Maybe this could be explained with cut contents, I don't know. But still is a good story.Then, gameplay-wise, the fighting system is extremely good and satisfying. Wei can learn fighting movements with his old sensei, and also he can learn others when your triad level get higher. Exploring the city feels good, it's interesting search for collectibles and there's a lot of side missions, including races, hacking cameras, random events, favors and more. Driving cars is not that pleasant, but is acceptable, and cops porsuit is also good. The game has a good level of customization possibilities, from clothing to buying cars and items for your houses.And man, the soundtrack. UFG did a great work with it, there's a lot of radios, some with english pop, rock or eletronic, other with cantonese radios, with hip-hop and popular songs in the country, and also, there's a radio with classic music. And it's incredible how some songs are put in story missions, after one of the saddest missions on the game the wedding, this song just begun to play in the first car I got. Then, in a race in a place more distant from the city, this one started.After writing this, I just feel bad because I know that a sequel is unlikely now. And seeing the status of some franchises owned by Square Enix and their latest titles, like Just Cause and Deus Ex, it might be best to remain like this, but if someday Sleeping Dogs 2 comes, I will be there with my pork buns ready.REVIEW: 9.5/10			"

												Bought this game accidentally after watching some sort of fighting compilation video, treated it as a cheap GTA clone, never expected much, but damn, this game delivers.Game incorporates some really fun gameplay mechanics, yes they are not new, borrowed from Max Payne (shooting) and Def Jam (fighting), all this blended with your typical open world features. While the game doesn't probably match the quality of Rockstar open world games, it really miles ahead of them when it comes to mechanics. To the key points then, good things:Immersive main story with variety of missions.Lot's of stuff to do: sidequests, jobs, street racing, drug busts, collectibles ect.As mentioned - really fun gameplay mechanics, slow-motion shooting and limb-breaking kung-fu delivers.Graphics and animations are pretty, very good motion capture, lots of advanced graphical options (AA, SSAO, HI-RES textures, shadow filtering, motion blur etc.).Burnout-style arcade driving with the ability to hijack cars on the go.Rather good depiction of Hong Kong with memorable characters and stylish music. Mr. Will Yun Lee did a terrific job as Wei Shen and most other characters deserve a praise as well.A lot of DLC which is smoothly incorporated in the main game (aside from 2 bigger DLC campaigns).Controversial:While the fighting system is good it really lacks depth. I understand that it was their first attempt with this game and they just tested whether people would like such fighting system or not in an open word game, but unfortunately it becomes stale rather fast, most likely due to quite underdeveloped skill tree which rarely adds new moves to your arsenal and sometimes just repeats itself, not to mention that some ""skills"" add only questionable passive bonuses.Social Hub is a fun feature where you can crack some records in variety of activities, but like almost every other leader board on Steam it's overrun by hackers with their impossible numbers. You still can use friend-filter and check out who did better among your FL.Story is pretty short, I guess if you rush it then you can complete it in under 10 hours...Bad things:Game is very easy, I ended up going for disarms 24/7 instead of vault-shooting most of the time just because you can survive a dozen of point blank shots from every weapon. It was basically the only way to occasionally die and make things harder for myself. Dying in melee is almost impossible though. Game could really benefit from multiple difficulty settings.Some technical difficulties, game freezing sometimes during launch screen and it changes resolution from time to time when you alt-tab out of it.SSAO cannot be turned off completely for some obscure reasons (not even via driver settings) so be prepared for an extra tax on your hardware.If you're a fan of GTA then you probably already played this, but if you're not (like myself) and hesitant then give this game a try, it has all sorts of stuff to keep you playing.EDIT: I even made my own video :>

												Sleeping Dog's is a GTA style action and adventure game set in open-world Hong-Kong, where you take the role of Wei Shen, an undercover cop that infiltrates one of the HK triads Sun On Yee. As game progresses, you gain both Police and Triad XP that provides different perks for each next level. Additionally, you gain face XP that provides additional bonuses and certain collectibles (jade statues) allow you to unlock melee combos in the local martial arts club. The game offers a wide range of various side missions (chase sequences, beat-em up missions, drug busts, dating missions, shooting missions, races) and mini games ♥♥♥♥♥♥(rooster) fights, tournaments, karaoke). In overall, there's a heavy focus on driving and puzzle solving, as well, as hand-to-hand combat. Although, hand-to-hand combat is enjoyable, the driving and puzzle solving starts to get annoying and/or repetitive after a while. It seems, that the game was artificially made longer through driving, lock picking, camera hacking and collectible searching. However, the story is really strong and interesting and you grow attached to the main character and some of the NPCs. The graphics and voice acting are of high level and overall Sleeping Dogs is a fun, action-pumped open-world experience with a nice dose of Hong-Kong action flick influence. But, unfortunately, there are quite a few little faults that pull the game down and, as a result, it offers only a slightly above-the-average experience. Definitely enjoyable, but with more polish it could've been excellent.PROS:- Interesting main story missions- A vast variety of side missions- A skill tree- A vast variety of character skins and wide range of vehicle choices- Great combat mechanics- Good graphics (although the Definitive Edition is actually not that much of an improvement compared to the Standard Edition)- Open-world environment that is a simplified and not a very accurate replica of Hong Kong (who cares though?)- Emma Stone and Lucy Liu as voice actors ;)CONS:- Lack of convenient fast-travel options (only taxis that cost money and are not available everywhere and the car valet)- Dependence on foods and drinks that need constant replenishing for stat boosts- Annoying driving experience from time to time (narrow streets, intense traffic, AIs suddenly stopping in the middle of the road or changing lanes, camera spins on reverse, exaggerated momentum)- Sometimes it's hard to find the objective in the street mazes of Hong Kong- Inaccurate ranged weapons and barely noticeable cross-hairsMISCELLANEOUS- Romance is very superficial, it should have had more substance- Both the Definitive and Standard Edition didn't recognize my Nvidia videocard on Windows 8 and 8.1 and they crashed or freezed on the first loading screen. The forum solutions didn't work. I was able to play Sleeping Dogs only after the upgrade to Windows 10.My overall rating: 7.5/10DLCs:- Nightmare in North Point: imo, the best DLC of them all. A fun combat experience with elements of Chinese folklore. Adds some additional combat mechanics that allows you to fight demons and the blood-craving ghosts.- The Zodiac Tournament - also a fun story around a fighting tournament in the style of Enter the Dragon- Year of the Snake - a heavy focus on driving, repetitive side missions. The story is about Wei Shen investigating a terrorist cult. Quite boring.			"

												I beat the original on PS3, I put 20 hours or so into the standard edition on PC, and now I've picked up the Definitive Edition on PC. So yeah, obviously, I really enjoy this game. I think it holds it's own against other sandbox games in its class; notably GTA and Saints Row. It's much more serious in tone though--it plays the whole ""good cop in too deep"" thing with a very straight face.So, the positives: Deep hand to hand combat mechanics Environmental kills look neat (putting someones face in a fan blade never gets old)Gunplay is funDriving is solidGreat voice acting and engaging story despite the genre tropesPolished visuals The world is well built, its very immersive, you feel like you're in Hong KongCons - there aren't manyCamera can get a little wonky in closed spaces, doesn't happen oftenSome of the side quests are a bit on the dry/tedious sideThings to be aware ofI've personally found that the definitive edition is a bit more demanding graphically than the regular edition, which makes sense being that they polished it up for the ""next gen"" (their words, not mine. The game looks good but it's far from being a ""next gen"" experience, imo). This will demand a bit more from your rig. I can NOT run this edition as high as I did the standard edition. So, if you were barely able to play the previous iteration just be aware that you may not have such luck with the definitive. Don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not, just giving you my own story.Anyway, enjoy.			"

Posted: December 5, 2014
												""You are a cop, I'm an undercover cop. The rules are different"" I think this famous line from the sleeping dogs marketing campaign sums it up well. The games protagonist Wei Shen is as he says in the quote. An undercover cop, infiltrating the notorious (fictional) Hong Kong Triad the ""Sun On Yee."" You get to play Wei as he goes deeper and deeper into the Triad lifestyle and organization too try and shut it down from the inside, while trying to keep his loyalties to the police in this sandbox game from Square Enix. The game isn’t perfect but it accomplishes what it wanted to do and is a welcome change of pace in the sandbox genre.The story begins with Wei Shen working for the police department when he is recruited by the police superintendent to go deep undercover into the Sun On Yee Triad due to his extensive skills and childhood relationships with current members. Wei takes the job on and then the real journey begins. Wei goes through a lot to prove his loyalties to Triad lieutenant Winston along with his childhood friend Jackie. Wei finds that a rival lieutenant is at odds with Winston and it quickly leads to a gang war. Wei has to take extreme actions to prove he is loyal to his Triad which starts to put him at odds with the police. The hole gets deeper and deeper for Wei in a compelling story that’s well written and well-acted.The gameplay is pretty standard sandbox fair. It plays pretty much exactly like GTA which it takes obvious inspiration from in almost all aspects of the game. The key difference between the two is the emphasis on melee combat; guns are much more rare in Hong Kong than they are in American based sandbox games. So naturally the melee combat is much more refined than it is in other sandbox games. The melee combat plays almost identical to the ""Batman Arkham"" series, though not quite as smoothly but it works fine. Beating down gangsters in Bruce Lee style martial arts fighting never gets old thankfully and is lots of fun. It is however, naturally much more grounded than Batman, so don’t expect to go all flying fists everywhere during a fight. It actually works very well having the game's combat so focused on melee. It changes things up and provides greater difficulty than having all the games fights be settled with guns. Now that doesn’t mean that there aren't gun fights in this game because there sure are, lots of them and they have a John Woo film/Max Payne bullet time feature which is tons of fun. Particularly in the games third act. The guns fights really aren’t very hard, about as difficult as a GTA game and play identically to GTA IV and V. Driving naturally is also something that you will do A LOT. It's just the part of the nature of sandbox games as GTA and Saints Row players will know and expect. The game has plenty of cars and motorcycles and other types of vehicles to get around in. Another welcome addition that sleeping dogs brings to the table is an easy, functional and basic parkour system. The games parkour is mostly just for making moving around the city easy, fast and fun. You won’t be climbing buildings ""Assassins Creed"" style but it works well and makes movement lots of fun. Car combat is prevalent as well. The game allows you to shoot while driving with 360 degree aiming in a well-designed easy to use system. It makes crazy hi-octane car battles some of the highlights of Sleeping Dogs. The game's story mission and side mission structure works identically to GTA. There’s the main story missions marked with green icons on your map. Side missions are marked with variously coloured icons for different things such as: police missions, favours for citizens of Hong Kong etc. Story missions feature a clever mechanic where you are graded on your performance as a Triad gangster and a cop based on your actions during a mission. Killing your enemies in effective and brutal ways will get you more points with your Triad score while minimizing damage to the public will get you points for your cop score. It really makes missions more interesting and gives good incentive to be precise and careful during missions. There are quite a lot of side missions to do as well but unfortunately this is where one of the games main flaws resides. Many of the less significant side missions are recycled and repetitive which can be boring and even some what frustrating. It terms of the main story it’s also on the shorter side at thirty missions. It is an exciting, intense and well done story however so it's easy to forgive its shorter length. The best side missions are for sure the police cases. These have you looking into serious crimes for the police while working outside the system. You investigate kidnapping of illegal immigrants, serial killers, organ harvesters, the black market and hard core drug dealing. These all tell small stories on the side that are satisfying to play and solve. Street racing with various ""classes"" of vehicles ranging from class A-C is common and lots of fun, especially with the class A vehicles. It helps that the driving is pretty well done in the game. Now aside from the main story and side missions there are other things you can do with your time as well. Karaoke is very popular in Hong Kong and when you go to clubs there are rooms where you can take part in a guitar hero style mini game of karaoke played with your keyboard or your controller. There aren't many songs to play but they are fun. You can also go hunting the collectables, which thankfully are all helpful and actually do something. There are three kinds of collectables in the game: health shrines, jade statues and lockboxes. There are fifty health shrines in total and like the name suggests finding them will increase your max health. There are like one hundred lockboxes that are full of money and unlock more clothing options. The best collectables though are for sure the twelve jade statues, finding them allow you to unlock new moves to use in melee combat. These moves are taught to you by Wei's wise childhood sensei; every time you bring him one he has a heart to heart with Wei about his life choices and his past. They also discuss his life as a Triad but he cannot reveal his true nature as an undercover cop and it’s surprisingly insightful. The characters are very important of course, Sleeping Dogs has a big cast of characters who are all well written and very well acted. Besides Wei there's his best friend and Triad member Jackie, his Triad boss Winston, Police Superintendent Pendrew and many others. One thing that Sleeping Dogs brings back from GTA San Andreas is Wei having relationships with various women over the course of the story. However this is a big screw up in how Sleeping Dogs executes these relationships. Basically it works like this. You meet a woman and help her out, and then she gives Wei her number. You go on one date with her and then at the end of the date you have sex which you see or hear none of (this sex comes way too easy by the way) and then you unlock some bonus after. The bonuses are actually really helpful so even though these relationships are so poorly done they are still totally worth doing. Another issue with the game is the celebrity voices. No the celebrities don’t do bad jobs in their roles, in fact they do well. However they are super underutilized, Tom Wilkinson plays the police superintendent and even though it sounds super important he isn’t in the game nearly as much as you would expect. Lucy Lui and Emma Stone are barley even in the game at all. A total waste of money and talent. All in all Sleeping Dogs is a fun sandbox game. It has some notable flaws that hold it back from being in the same league as its competition and inspiration. It brings some welcome things to the sandbox game table with its parkour and emphasis on melee combat as well its clever cop/criminal dynamic with the protagonist. I can easily recommend this game when it’s on sale.  7/10			"

												So I downloaded the Definitive Edition of Sleeping Dogs on Steam. Gotta say I was pretty impressed with some parts in the game they really took extra care of. One thing I really like instead of boxes and crates just flying around all over now they will actually move and break apart. Your car driving stages are MUCH smoother this time around compared to before. (I sometimes hated the driving and shooting stages.) They fixed alot of other bugs including one that was very annoying. When walking up to certain food stations or NPC's sometimes Wei will walk in place and take like 2 or 3 minutes to finally get in the right position to finally speak to them That thankfully also has been fixed. If you were on the fence about getting Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition before try it out now. Lots of improvements plus if you originally had the game you can upgrade and pay $15 for the newer version. Overall? Solid game Can't wait to play through it again!			"

Of course like other 3rd person console ports there are some issues with controls (and disgusting aim assist) and the driving felt very weird to me like you were driving through molasses or something but even with that the game was still fun to play through. I didn't do all the side quests but I did most of them (and played pretty slowly) and racked up 25 hours so for the current price I'd say it's a definite pickup. That being said it's, in my opinion, not worth the $30 price tag that it has normally, it's a fun game but it's not $30 fun. 7/10 get some pork buns			"

												This game is amazing,ok it's also not perfect even in its ""definitive edition""but the Hong Kong setting, very different to what I'm used to, undercover cop... very interesting game imho. Also a good GTA-like albeit with a bit more fighting.The good:-good gfx-good music-awesome setting-Lucy Liu voiced Vivienne !The minor flaws : -some binds are not rebindable, even though you can rebind most of them too badexamples : map hotkey, phone hotkeys-can't call anyone in the middle of missions, sometimes forcing you to steal a car or walk a lot-the car controls are good overall, very easy to do 180° turns & the like, that said they lack in precision, it's somewhat not easy to navigate in between cars without hitting any, particularly with fast cars. It's not undoable, it's just the car tend to jump left & right instead of smoothly turn.-when people are in your car, or even alone, sometimes it's good to drive ""slowly"" if you wanna hear all the conversations, I know I made the mistake a few times and the game just skip ahead if you went too fast, therefore you might miss out on stuff. (albeit it's minor)-I know guns are a rarity in hong kong, but you can lose your gun while eating pork bun .....it just vanishes ....also in the same vein, some guns are in locked boxes, had an Uzi ? well there was a gun in the box, Uzi vanished ...If you read all that you must think : ""what the hell so many flaws ?"" well it's all pretty minor, too bad this wasn't polished a little more, but the game is worth going through these little annoyances.

												Wow, I can't thank the developers of this game enough for an amazing job they have done to create a game that looks amazing and can be played flawlessly. The game has such fluid motion even in full throttle action racing through the streets and the gameplay from start to finish is very personal and inviting. From a PC Enthusiast I recommend this game over Watch Dogs and all the GTA's. I put this in the same category of joy to play a PC game as playing Tomb Raider, Kingdoms of Amular, Skyrim, Witcher 2, Batman Arkham City, Darksiders and Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands of Time. I'm not saying it is better or worse than these games but I thoroughly enjoyed these games and it's so hard to find a new game with these next generation high definition graphics that can play well, well this one plays amazingly. Thank you for updating this game and  getting it to play so well. I must admit to all gamers out there this game uses 95% on GPU1 and 97% on GPU2 of my GTX 690 and averages 55-60FPS at 1080P, reduces to 45FPS sometimes but I don't notice unless I watch the FPS counter. so it isn't going to play 60FPS for your everyday card but I do have the game on the most extreme settings.I7 2600 @ 4.2Ghz Alphacool Watercooling System16GB G Skill Ram - 6GB used for XFAST RAMGTX 690 Alphacooled Watercooling SystemASROCK Z77 Extreme 4 MotherboardWindows 7I hope this review was helpful to you and you enjoy the game as much as I am, worth every cent.

												Is this a copycat GTA game? Sure! A lot of stuff in this game is almost a direct copy of GTA game mechanics. Does that make the game worse than GTA? No not at all!  Even though they have blatantly copied a lot of (the good) stuff from GTA they have added enough destinctive differences to make it a different game with it's own attitude and atmosphere. You do notice that this game has been made with a smaller budget than GTA series. Controls are a bit rough at times specially with vehicles, fighting the camera at some places, lesser quality physics and a bit less detailed map. However, the gameplay is more fun than in GTA (imo). Unlike in GTA your character in Sleeping Dogs can fight and learn fighting techniques. Specially later on in the game after your character is a skilled fighter you can have some great looking (kung fu) combat moves against opponents and have challenging battles on your hand.As for the story and all the story missions you can expect the same'ísh as in GTA, same thing more or less, but then in Asian style. It does have more interesting game mechanics that GTA does not have, such remote manual unlocking/hacking with your phone.And as for the map, it is a bit more oldschool made than GTA 4 and 5, specially the terrain,vegetation and rocks. When you look at the buildings and the terrain you can see they didn't had the budget to compete with GTA quality, however it still looks great and immersive on maxed settings!For some reason this game never became quite AAA popular, even at release (if I remember right) it wasn't that hyped at all. Strange, because this game is so worth a playthrough (and a 2nd)! 85/100			"

												A beautiful remake of Sleeping Dogs, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition brings many improvements, such as an increased population to the city (Hong Kong isn't a ghost town, after all), far better reflections, an everpresent and atmospheric fog, and much better textures. This of course causes much greater load on your machine, so be sure you've got enough juice. On my 7970s, it can get quite framey when deep in the city with large crowds. Otherwise, it runs at a buttery-smooth 60FPS.While some may dismiss this as a quick cash-grab, if you haven't had a chance to play Sleeping Dogs, now's your chance, and if you have, you'll enjoy the graphical improvements.

												I just finished beating the main story and the expansion""Year of the Snake.""  This is a great game with an exciting combat system.  This game plays like a modern day kung fu movie.  Where it is honestly hard to tell which side of the law your character will prefer.  Will he choose to rat out his childhood friends and assist the police, or fight for the Sun on Yee Triad?  The plot twists and turns until the very end.  During game play you will learn several different martial arts attacks and pick up some ancient chinese wisdom along the way.  Courtesy of your neighborhood kung fu master.  I really enjoy the added features of the definitive edition.  Especially the added character skins or outfits.  Like the all to important SWAT uniform, which is great for brawls.  Leveling up is fast and it is possible to level up in several different manners.  With the most important being your Triad and Police scores given after the completion of each mission.  The only downside is there are a few glitches leftover from the earlier version on console.  Your phone might glitch so you can't put it away or your cars might disappear from the garage during the Amanda side missions.  There is no way to get them back.All in all a great game.  I would recommend this game to anyone who has ever watched a martial arts movie.   "

												So is the definitive edition of Sleeping Dogs worth it if you have already played Sleeping Dogs on pc. Well from the get go you will notice the little details like Facial features.car textures,colors & the streets of hong kong are more populated with people I have never seen before & I have seen a lot in the original Sleeping Dogs in my 59 hours of playing it .The lighting has also been imporved as well to give it that more realistic feel. There is also a legendary clothing shop which makes all the dlc clothing available for purchase & not just in your wardrobe which makes the process of going out collecting the red envlopes & opening lockboxes more enjoyable when you actually have to spend the time to work towards buying all your outfits instead of having a large sum of money towards the end game.There are also some new cop missions as well from taking out gangs members to stopping a street race by taking out All the street racers before the race finishes.Add that in with the bonus of getting all the dlc & you have yourself one of the best looking games on pc for a reasonable price. For those that haven't played Sleeping Dogs yet what are you waiting for go & experience Wei Shen's Amazing story now.			"

												Note: This review is about the changes in ""Definitive Edition"", not about the game itself. So what is the difference between the original version and definitive edition? Not much, it's just patched original Sleeping Dogs with full DLC and some improvements to the graphic that are either insignificant or unimportant. I can play the original version at max setting with solid fps, but I have to play this one on medium because the fps are too unstable (FYI, my spec is more or less the same as recommended), I also have a problem with ingame screen resolution, it causes me to have some kind of slightly visible letterbox appears at times, which is annoying because original version didn't have it. But as I said, the changes to graphic are insignificant. World density is the only improvement that worth mentioning, which makes the world more living by adding more cars, people on streets, NPC variations (less clones),... but this change can be achieved by a free patch, not a patch being sold. Also, still no Steam Cloud, wtf dev? Seriously? In short, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game, but this Definitive Edition is a quick cash grab, patched games being sold at high price. Don't buy it if you already owned the original version, it's not worth it.For people with spec below recommended: Don't buy it because the spec given by the dev is inaccurate, you can play it on low smoothly, but it will look worse and less stable than the original version on medium. It seems the game doesn't use up all the CPU power, but depends mostly on GPU power, which means you need a strong GPU to play this game on high smoothly.			"

												I spent over 100 hours on the original Sleeping Dogs several years ago on my old PC; on my new, much more powerful machine, I was thrilled to play the definitive edition. It's not merely a re-release - it's a reworking of the graphics and an improvement on the already fun, fluid combat and driving mechanics, and it contains additions to the campaign (extended narrative, extra side missions) that are worthy of the repurchase cost for fans who already have the original (specifically those who liked it and want to play it again). Because I had already finished the campaign as well as the DLC episodes, I was hesitant to buy the same game twice, but when it went on sale for $7.50, I struck and was very happy I did. This is not only an extended and much more immersive experience; it works better on newer software and hardware architecture. It manages to pack Hong Kong more densely with NPCs and greatly improve environmental textures and weather while demanding much less of my GPU than the original release. They both hit some of the same framerates, but with settings cranked, my video card runs much harder & hotter in the original release while it's capable of rendering much more with less power in the definitive edition. Truly an optimal redesign for the PC.For the many who've already played Sleeping Dogs and loved it, I recommend picking up the definitive edition IF you want to play through the campaign again or if you haven't played the DLC episodes (and I'd wait for a sale). You may find the experience enjoyable as I did or you may feel like you're wading through the same water (albeit much more detailed, highly rendered water). If you've never played this modern classic, this is the edition to get - it's a very fun open world action/adventure game in the vein of Grand Theft Auto with tons of collectibles, a martial arts beat 'em up combat system, great driving mechanics, fun missions and side-objectives, and, most importantly of all, a captivating story fronted by a compelling protagonist who leads a double life as both an undercover cop & triad member and a Chinese-American immigrant & Chinese national. As another Asian-American who's faced confusion stemming from a bi-cultural background, I find Wei Shen to be a well written, sympathetic and multi-faceted hero/anti-hero. In addition, the ties the game shares with HK Crime and Kung Fu films (references, atmosphere, setting, style) alone are enough to draw me in to its highly detailed vision of modern Hong Kong and keep me playing in it time and time again.

 I give Sleeping Dogs: 8/10  SPOILER FREE! Sleeping Dogs is a really immersive game, not in terms of graphics but in terms of gameplay. We follow our main protagonist who is a cop, back in his hometown of Hong Kong where he grew up. Only this time, he's going undercover to stop big crime organisations such as the Sun On Yee (Sun Yee On in real life, yes they were real gangs). The game itself had some of the most fun gameplay features I've ever seen. The gameplay felt like I was really a part of Hong Kong. Pros  The best feature about this game is the combat. The combat gameplay in this game is really mind-blowing because of how balanced it is. At times, it doesn't feel too easy but it isn't too hard either. I really liked how you can unlock new moves, and how the game focused more on brawling than gun gameplay. The graphics in this game are really good, especially on the interior houses that you own. The character models could be improved a bit, so can the whole depth of field and atmosphere, but the world detail was really outstanding and I really liked it. The character development in this game was really done well. You built relationships with the people around you, both cop and gang sides. The sound is the game is really good too. It builds you into the environment like as if you are really there. Performance wasn't an issue, the game ran really smooth on high. Cons  the worst thing about sleeping dogs in my opinion was the driving. The driving felt really stiff and at times, racing was a lot harder because of this. Yes there was handbrakes and braking, but the driving just didn't really make me like how it was controlled. Lack of vehicle catergories. There was hardly any wide ranges of cars/bikes, and besides that, there is only on land and on sea vehicles. That showed the game with less variety. The map is really short and inconvinient. Sometimes, the map felt really short and didn't make Hong Kong seem big at all. It would have been better if the map was a lot bigger.I hope you have enjoyed my review of Sleeping Dogs. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a Fast and Furious like game, (or even a Kung Fu movie).  Story Graphics Performance Soundtrack Enjoyment Overall   8 7 8 7 8 7.6   "

												Amazing storyline, diverse characters that are all unique and with great dialogue and voice acting, fun events, side missions, and DLC. You can really relate to the protagonist, Wei Shen, and the other main characters you meet throughout the story. Sleeping Dogs will always be one of my most favourite games. I can't remember how many times I've played through it on console or PC. The campaign is amazing, unfortunately it immerses you so much that you end up completing it before you know it, leaving you feeling empty and defeated. Then you just start from the begining again and the cycle continues :)Honestly, the greatest, most underrated open world game of the decade.Overall, if you haven't played Sleeping Dogs before, then I highly recommend that you do. It's one of those games you simply must experience.			"

												Sleeping Dogs features Wei Shen, an undercover cop struggling to balance his Triad loyalty and police responsibilities on the streets of Hong Kong.The game features a well-crafted martial arts combat system, blending combos, counters, light and heavy attacks, and grabs/throws to create freeform fights that emphasize flow and diversity over efficiency. Environmental attacks and upgradeable special moves round out the variety.The real selling point is the map design - Hong Kong is lovingly rendered with beautiful levels of detail, from crowded market streets to curved highways overlooking endless rows of shipping docks. It's a delight to simply drive along the coastal highways and listen to the rippling shoreline or zip around the market districts. It's downright breathtaking, and stands head and shoulders above GTA's cities in terms of sheer visual interest.The story is solid, albeit a bit standard. Gunplay, driving, and some side activities like gambling or drug busts provide a solid variety of activities for the entire map. Music, sound and voice acting are top-notch.This is a a polished and cinematic take on the GTA sandbox formula, I thoroughly recommend it.			"

A review for Sleeping Dogs : Definitive EditionIn this review, most of the review will review the gameplay of the game, as I seen that the meat of the game should also be in its gameplay. While some game will require great interfaces, games that are focused on open-world fighting/shooting should be focused on its gameplay.The first thing about this game, is that it has excellent gameplay, and quite varied with the well-established free-roaming games such as Grand Theft Auto series, Saints Row series, or Just Cause series. While four of them are great, the thing that makes Sleeping Dogs great is it have small amount of guns. It means that guns are hard to come by, most enemies don't have guns, and for the most part of the game you won't be using a gun.You won't be using your gun, but you are using your fist and your martial skill, this is what makes the game interesting. As with other fighting games, you can chain combo, do heavy strikes, block and counter, and other typical fighting moves. As you collect collectibles in the game, you will gain more advanced martial arts strikes, thus making you are more potent combatant. For most of the game you will face off with your enemy with Triad enemies with your fist, so fighting in the game have more color than its FPS aspect. In the fighting, you and your enemies will use believable melee weapons such as knife, tire iron, batons, meat cleaver, and not using melee weapons that are scarcely available in modern settings such as spears, katanas, or swords. This makes the fighting more realistic.The great aspect in the fighting is the environmental kills. These type of kills are brutal, that's for sure. You could stick someone's head in rotating fans, throw somebody to a flaming furnace, electrocute them with high voltage, throw them to the garbage bin, puncture their lungs using ""sharp objects"", drown them in water, and many more. In the shooting aspect, this game is also good. Not great, but good. The type of weapon did not vary very much, because then, as the story will tells you : ""Guns are rare in Hong Kong."" The game features a ""shoot from cover"" system and ""blind fire"" system, closely looks like GTA IV system, but there are some perks in shooting aspect, like you can enter slow mo mode if you leap from one place to other place. There is nothing new in shooting aspect, but it's good enough, in my opinion it's better than GTA IV system.In the gameplay, it's interesting also to note that your character is not Thor or something. The character will die quickly if shot at, making we more careful if we exchange fire with firearm-wielding enemies. While the character could take more damage in melee fighting, it's interesting to see that our character could not take much hit from firearms. It's quite real obviously, you could take three to four punches without dying, but two shots could kill you. This, and coupled with lack of firearms (and its ammunition) makes the police/law in the game very strong, because you could not bring your fist to a firefight.The ambience of Hong Kong is very greatly potrayed. I have been to Hong Kong for numerous times, and I would like to say that the spirit of Hong Kong is captured well. The signboards really reflects Hong Kong, as does how Hong Kong shop owners shout to the customers to ask them to purchase some DVDs, or how great their pork bun is. The street is also filled with Hong Kong cars, most notably the red taxi, the green small bus, the blue truck/construction worker transport, and many others. The street signs also are done in Chinese, so that the environment is greatly looking as the real Hong Kong. The only thing that I complains is there are lack of Chinese language use, because though Hong Kong people do understand English, in most times they are using Chinese, not English. While some ""curses"" in the game are obviously Chinese, I would like if the game respect Chinese language more.The activity of this game is somewhat bland. You have the regular racing (while you have to be #1, which is another thing I complain). You have fight clubs, where you will fight people. The only activity that interests me is the ""drug raid"" system, which are akin to GTA San Andreas hood takeover system. You fight some people, and you call something on TV, jobs done. There are lockboxes, shrines, and others as collectibles, but I don't see collecting collectibles as activities. For instance, there are no restaurants, no strip clubs, no bars, that you could interact. Story wise, this game have excellent story. I would not spoil it, but somewhat the ending is ""expected"". The twist of the game is ""expected"" too. If you have watched the movie about undercover agents you would know who will betray you. But, all in all, an excellent story.The ""other"" games that are provided in the Definitive Edition (the zombie, the police pack, etc.) are not going to be reviewed much, because they are not the meat of the game. While they are interesting, I would say that the DLCs are pretty bland. Purchase this game, and purchase that pork bun, because a man without a pork bun in their hand is not a real man.			"

												Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is quite the thrill ride! It takes place in Hong Kong, and you take on the role of an undercover cop, Wei Shen. It is tasked to you to infiltrate the Triad gang known as the Sun On Yee (新安義), and become one of their own. Wei Shen starts his way into the gang by means of his childhood friend Jackie Ma, slowly gaining trust and respect along the way.The game is played in third-person, from behind the main character, though you have free camera movement to look from the front, sides, up, down, etc. There are various play styles along the way, from casual walking and running, to driving cars or motorcycles, to combat moments, parkour chases, driving gunfights, and so on...The visuals of the game are gorgeous, the city is bright and beautiful, especially when the lights all come on at night. When it rains, which usually is a pretty torrential downpour, is always visually beautiful, everything is wet and shiny. The surface of a simple puddle on the ground reflecting the world around it, it's absolutely stunning. When driving fast in a car or on a bike, the way the world streaks and blurs away in motion is great.There are clothes shops throughout the city that you can purchase different elements of clothing from shirts, vests, jackets, coats, pants, shorts, shoes, glasses, hats, chains, watches, bracelets, etc. There are also vehicle stores for purchasing cars and motorcycles throughout the city as well. Some clothing and vehicles are unlocked automatically through game progression, but most you will purchase as you make money on jobs and favours (and running over parking meters on the sides of the street with your car, haha).Many missions are presented to you throughout the game, some are through regular game progression, some you have to find, including small favours from shop owners, random people you meet on the street, fellow gang members, etc. These are optional, but I find that they are often very much worth doing, as you gain money and respect / influence.Gameplay is fluid, very smooth and natural, running, walking, driving... the parkour requires you to be smooth, you need to time your jumping over objects just right, or else you end up clumsily hopping over something and slowing down, trying to catch your bearings. The combat is sometimes difficult, and not so smooth. You will often have someone attacking you while you are dealing with one guy, and you need to counter their attack. Counters, grapples, and environmental kills are often fun, but have to be done just right (but those can often be quite brutal, yet satisfying).With the Definitive Edition of the game, you get all the DLC packs that were originally purchased separately from the main game, the key ones being Nightmare at North Point and Year of the Snake stories, which I would recommend doing after you have completed the main story. Year of the Snake pretty much takes you to right after the main game is finished, you're a beat cop investigating a cultist group planting bombs all over the city during the Chinese New Year. Nightmare at North Point takes you into only one area of the city, North Point (obviously) is only one of four areas you will see on your map. It is in this area that supernatural occurrences start taking place, as the undead start to rise by way of their leader Smiley Cat. But you gain some new supernatural abilities as well to deal with them.Overall, I had an awesome time playing this game. Put in about 70 hours at the time of this review. Main story and the DLCs, completed all missions and favours, and have 100% achievements. It was, as I said, quite a thrill ride, and I loved it. Highly recommended 9.5/10			"

												I love this game!Major overhaul on the graphics: really makes Hong Kong feel alive, also it awesome that they included all the DLCs with the game. Solid gameplay, does get repetitive after a while if you don't progress through the story. Speaking of Sleeping Dogs story line, its a nice change when compared to all the new indie survival/voxel/horror/crafting/multiplayer-only/rpg/storyline-less games. I picked it up when it came out for 15$ and recommend, if you're interested, you buy it now during the autumn sale or the winter sale(might be cheaper).For those like myself that already own the original version I still recommend getting it. I didn't realize I'd have so much fun in a second play through. TL;DR Buy it			"

												I've played the original Sleeping Dogs and it was a pretty great game. This version is no different, however, it has improvements that make me recommend it over the original. The performance is solid, the controls are more natural for PC players, and really looks better in general. There's things like HDAO that make cutscenes look great, improved models, city density, better lighting and reflections, and of course, everyone's favorite, lens flare. I'd say it's a great game to get into if you haven't played it before. If you have, it's definately worth playing through again with all the pretty graphics and blinky lights. All the DLC is included as well so there is a lot available from the get-go. Visit the trading forum to get this game really cheap!I don't support this type of behavior from developers, but I liked the original and got it for free with my graphics card. I've always wanted to play the DLC missions as well, so this was an instant buy for me. Adding the solid 60fps that I didn't get from the original, I'd have to recommend it.Also, having FRAPS open disables the overlay.I'd give this a 9/10.			"

												A great open world game with a lot to do, excellent cast and plot, fun fluid martial arts combat and some good action-movie styled gunplay/shootouts. The sidemissions in the game are generally fun, although the drug busts can get repetitive. Decent character customization, but some bad animation besides in the cutscenes (which were done with motion capture I imagine) and the martial arts combat, which felt very fluid.Gunplay was alright, it wasn't the highlight of the game but it was still very fun, and the slow-motion while vaulting and shooting was very satisfying. The graphics are good, the model detail was good for the most part, although the detail on the civilians was pretty bad for the most part, as to be expected with an open world game.Overall, this game is a fun open-world interpretation of Hong-Kong. In my opinion it's worth more than the 30$ it's selling at right now. If I was to rate it, I'd give it an 8/10. Favorite Square-Enix game in my opinion.			"

I feel not enough fun with missions...Secondly - mode of fight . I never seen better grapple  , I felt like real kung fu fighter Yip Man  a lot of tricks to train and show enemies who is  master of hong kong .Finally - Open world , city - Map is enough big , lot points to see , town really looks like hong kong city.- Things I hate in gameStyle of driving... games with open world must have normal style driving and here it is like soap on ice Cars texture Music... we can not listen any music in background and in missions  except soundtracks in vehicles Graphic 7/10   Sounds 7/10  Gameplay 7.5/10  "

-Quick Review-Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is an Open World, with Third-Person Shooter and Martial Arts combat themes. There are many side tasks and side missions for you to run; races, fight clubs, gambling, police missions, and much more. -Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as Wei Shen, an undercover cop attempting to infiltrate a Hong Kong criminal organization known as the ""Sun On Yee"". Will Wei Shen keep his loyalties to the cops? will he become unstable from the stress? Will he be swayed to only work for the Sun On Yee and forsake his allegiances? You'll need to play to find out. (I'll tell you this much: I had no idea which direction we were going in this game.)


He stands alone, on the over pass with his smoking hot Motorcycle.

Gameplay: (There's a lot to say about the Gameplay in Sleeping dogs, so I'm going to add more sub-topics. Hopefully that makes the information easier to read.)-CombatMartial ArtsThere are two types of combat in Sleeping Dogs; Martial Arts and eventually (when you get a gun) the shooting combat is played in third person. The Martial Arts section has different combinations of attacks; for example, click click click-and-hold, click click click click click-and-hold. However for most of the combo's you'll need to unlock by returning statues (hold that thought, we'll come back to that later).So you've got your clicky basic attacks, but wait! There's more! There is also grappling. By grappling you grab a hold of your enemy for a short time, you can proceed to beat your enemy like a drum with standard clicks... or you can embrace your inner monster and smash your new dance partner into an environmental object. You can do a special environmental kills with various objects which are outlined in red while grappling. (remember to make your choice fast, or else your dance partner will escape!)Arguably the most important features of the hand-to-hand combat is counter attacking, before most attacks the attacking NPC will suddenly have a red outline, at this time if you press the counter button (""E"" on the default keyboard controls) Wei will execute various counter attacks, counters are extremely important, many tough enemies are nearly impossible to defeat without them.I would quickly like to make a few aesthetic mentions: the Martial Arts moves are spot on. I've been practicing TaeKwonDo for a few years, and watching those backspin kicks... oh! it's beautiful! Additionally the animation styles are very varied; so you don't keep seeing the same slow motion kills again and again, even after 30 hours spent in the game it's extremely satisfying to punch out someone, or if I get tired of that I could just put 'em in a dumpster.


Hello Face, I would like to introduce you to Mr.Table Saw

Third Person ShooterEventually Wei gets his hands on some weapons; there are plenty of them. The first few weapons will just be melee weapons, but eventually fire arms are introduced. At this point the game turns into a Third-Person Shooter. the significant feature of Sleeping Dogs where guns are concerned, is triggering slow motion after vaulting over objects while aiming.I have borderline-exploited this feature, I will spoiler tag my trick in case you want to figure it out on your own. While in slow motion I would score head shots on anyone in cross hairs distance. After slow motion stops I would just vault over another object to enter slow motion mode again. -DrivingThere's a lot of different types of vehicles you can drive; there are boats, motorcycles, cars, buses, motorized bikes, and many more. You can shoot while in most vehicle if you have a gun while driving. You can jump out of your vehicle and hijack other vehicles. You can smash into other vehicles by using a bashing or side swipe ability (""L-Shift"" on the default keyboard controls) -Leveling/progressionThere's a lot to appreciate about the sense of progression in Sleeping Dogs! There are 3 different experience and levels: Police experience, Triad Experience, and Face Experience. Each level rewards a different skill or perk. Additionally there are many collectibles, the most important collectibles are various statues which can be returned to the Dojo in exchange for new combination hand-to-hand-techniques.-DLCUnfortunately (or maybe 'fortunately', depends on if you like my reviews. haha) I cannot write reviews for the individual DLC. But to quickly cover the DLC: It's good.There's a lot of DLC included with the Definite Edition, I think I've only gotten through a fourth of the DLC content. It's also worth noting that the Definitive edition was advertised as adding graphical improvements to the game. (It ran very well on my Windows 10 machine at 1080p, just a side note)Achievements: Oh boy... an analytical break down for the steam achievements would take far too long. At the time that I'm writing this review, I've successfully completed the story and maxed triad, police, and face experience (30 hours, many of those hours being distracted by civilian tag with cars).A good chunk of the achievements are allocated like most other games: story, extra's, missions, 100%, find all the things. I can't speak from first hand experience (yet), but a friend of mine has already earned 100% completion on the game.Price: Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is priced at $29.99 I just relaxed and enjoyed taking my time on beating the main story and I've already racked up 30 hours. with only 50% of the achievements it's safe to say I've got plenty of game time that'll increase after this review has been posted.For those of you unfamiliar with my value system: I like to get a hour out of a game for every dollar spent. So I'm saying this game was a great value, and will increase in value as I play it.Conclusion: All in all, if you like Martial Arts, Third Person shooters, Action, Open World action genre games, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is for you. I was probably the target audience for this game, because I get really pumped while I play, in a way it helps inspire me for my next TaeKwonDo practice sessions.Special thanks to Angfucious for gifting me this game. You were 100% correct that I would love this game.P.S. The Umbrella Gang has it's eye on you. Umbrella gang! FOR UNCLE PO!


I'll probably use this for my review

Well... after finishing the story mode of the game in 2 days I can honestly say, this was an amazing journey.Introduction to the gameYou start the game as Wei Shen, a former police officer in San Francisco who's been transfered to a fictional hong kong which is split into four districts. Wei Shen has been assigned to destroy a Triad organization by the name of Sun On Yee.From there on out the game splits you into two characters - Wei Shen, police officer and Wei Shen, a member of the triad organization. Gameplay    → The Combat The combat system in this game is quite simple and easy to use, you fight with the click of your left mouse button and dodge incomming hits by pressing E at the right time. I really relish the fighting moments in the game where the character is faced off against 8 or more enemies at the same time, prooves quite a challenge at first but gets easier the more you do it. Another big thing in a lot of games are guns, not in this game though. You don't get a gun in your hand in the first 2 hours atleast into the game, you actually feel how powerful guns are in the game once you get them. You'll be spending most of the game fighting enemies with your fists or some other melee weapon rather then a pistol or an automatic.    → The VehiclesSimilarly to other games you can steal vehicles from a parking lot or the road by brutally janking the driver out, taking his place. Of course you don't have to steal vehicles, there is another to get a vehicle.There's a large variety of vehicles in the game for you to choose from. Once you obtain these vehicles in your garage you can choose 3-5 colors of your car and where you wish to recieve it from, there are multiple spots on the map from which you may take an infinite amount of these vehicles from. Some vehicles handle very nicely, others not so much. Occasionally you will run into a police situation from which you must escape and in this game it is quite easy, you just drive out of their detection zone and any ammount of police attention you had is just suddenly gone. Unfortunately there's no way of getting any air vehicles - Helicopters, planes etc. The sea vehicles are a bit of frustrating to control as they turn very slowly.    →The MinigamesSometimes you just want to take a break from the story mode but what do you do then? Do you go shoot people? Do you go explode cars? The answer is no. You go and sing karaoke ↓Me trying KaraokeIf karaoke isn't your thing you can also enjoy an exciting adrenaline rushing race in the streets of hong kong, or perhaps you feel like busting some crimes, you can!    → The collectiblesThroughout the map are placed many collectable items like statues, which you can give your old sensei in return for a new fighting technique. Then there are healing statue things which collecting will give you permanently more health, money can also be found in briefcases with sometimes a piece of clothing.     →The ExtrasYou can also purchase with ingame money clothing for Wei Shen which he will wear in any cutscene in the game, I think that's a very neat feature to the game aswell.The StoryThis game's story was really quite the journey, you can really feel the emotions of the characters in the game. Excitement, anger, grief, relief - all emotions that I've felt while playing this amazing masterpiece of a game, and if you really listen to the dialogue you will feel too. This is one of those games where once you start playing, you can't stop untill it's done.Final VertdictThis game has been a wonderful expirience for me and I suggest everyone to play it and enjoy it too. If you don't think you can run the definitve edition you should atleast buy the orginal. I'd rate this game a 10/10 for the pure depth of the game and story of it.			"

												This game is just riddled with bugs and lags. People can sit in the car without opening the doorSecond thing is the melee fighting mechanics, which are the whole core of the game as the weapons are truly scarce. The only real strategy that works in a fight is to: 1. grap smaller opponents, beat them up, run away,  2. kick bigger opponents once, run away  3 wait for the guy with a knife to strike, counter and hope none of the others are too close, run away. I think the countering system is essentially broken, where even if your reaction time is on spot, the character just does nothing to avoid damage. Best just to run in circles and grab, grab, grab. Driving is frustrating as hell.3/10 for good story and Hong Kong			"

												Note: This review is about the changes in ""Definitive Edition"", not about the game itself. So what is the difference between the original version and definitive edition? Not much, it's just patched original Sleeping Dogs with full DLC and some improvements to the graphic that are either insignificant or unimportant. I can play the original version at max setting with solid fps, but I have to play this one on medium because the fps are too unstable (FYI, my spec is more or less the same as recommended), I also have a problem with ingame screen resolution, it causes me to have some kind of slightly visible letterbox appears at times, which is annoying because original version didn't have it. But as I said, the changes to graphic are insignificant. World density is the only improvement that worth mentioning, which makes the world more living by adding more cars, people on streets, NPC variations (less clones),... but this change can be achieved by a free patch, not a patch being sold. Also, still no Steam Cloud, wtf dev? Seriously? In short, Sleeping Dogs is an amazing game, but this Definitive Edition is a quick cash grab, patched games being sold at high price. Don't buy it if you already owned the original version, it's not worth it.For people with spec below recommended: Don't buy it because the spec given by the dev is inaccurate, you can play it on low smoothly, but it will look worse and less stable than the original version on medium. It seems the game doesn't use up all the CPU power, but depends mostly on GPU power, which means you need a strong GPU to play this game on high smoothly.			"

												This open world, third person action feels a lot like Saints Row with a more serious note. There's blood and scenarios are merciless.The game is mainly fought with fists, but guns are available on select missions. Some situations are crazy, specially the bike races - NPCs will ram the flag girl at the start. The rest of the way, they will go crazy on you.Car physics are not easy to control. Ramming (button) can also be used while going sideways, which could be exploited when racing or driving fast in general. If you think races are difficult, just race later after you have the prototype car - then races can get funny.Movement is also awkward (I am using a mouse and keyboard setup). Camera angles in any mode (car / bike / foot) is hard to control, and you can't look too far up (which I find weird and sometimes irritating). On foot, turning is not as precise or quick as in other games (or even compared to real life). This can be frustrating in fighting... until you realize that you can use a car or bike to win them. The game is probably programmed more towards using a gamepad.Soundtrack is good. I only started to get tired of them after more than 30 hours of playing.Graphics are good, but sometimes can't keep up when driving fast. It only required 50% at 750MHz from my GTX 770, so I think many gamers can play this game.Sound effects are amazing. It has perfect use of audio positioning and environmental sounds are there. Though, at times, motor boat and water splashing sounds were skipping (not produced) for a few seconds in intervals.The story is alright, and the story telling is fine. Events can sometimes get weird. You can't grab who you're chasing (even when you're already touching them) until you've reached the end where you'll fight a group or they simply give up; but at the same time, as part of the game rule, you can't be too far away from them (again, in a chase scenario).This game scored a 5/10 for me, but I'm labeling it as a Recommend for the story telling and overall good fun. The controls is the biggest let-down as I was forced to play with a hard to control character until I finish it. The game has a serious note, but remember that this is a game and better just take full advantage of what you can do to avoid character control, camera and other possible frustrations it could give you.

Product received for free
												You'd be forgiven some trepidations about any game that's charted as ... unconventional a course to retail shelves as Sleeping Dogs. It first went into development at United Front Games as ""Black Lotus,"" then transformed to a reboot of Activision's True Crime series. Then, as the mega-publisher let the game slide into the hands of Square-Enix, it lost the legacy branding and was re-redubbed Sleeping Dogs. The ship that emerges from those choppy waters is surprisingly seaworthy, but it's not without a few cracks in the hull. For some, Sleeping Dogs' leaks may be hard to ignore.Triad gangs took Hong Kong police officer Wei Shen's sister from him, and he's given up everything to take them apart. As Sleeping Dogs picks up his story, Shen's already deep undercover, embedded in a low-level position with the Sun On Yee (a thinly veiled nod to the Sun Yee On, a real-life Triad gang).Though the Hong Kong setting may be exotic, Shen's story will be familiar to anyone who's ever watched, read, or played a story of an undercover cop. As Shen gets closer to toppling the organization, he's also getting closer to its members, embracing their vicious, glamorous lifestyle until even the player may be left to wonder where, exactly, he stands.At first, the distinction between cop and criminal is easy to make. Shen has no firearms and so must rely on martial arts (and the occasional tire iron) to bring down members of rival gangs.			"

Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a frenzied, artistic action game that, though it is marred by slight technical difficulties, still provides an enjoyable alternative to the standard action-sandbox.Sleeping Dogs' greatest strength comes from its presentation. The developers implemented the game's open-world replica of Hong Kong painstakingly with striking visuals and smartly interconnected layouts, which help the player see this beautifully-realized city from all angles. The characters' presentations are also done in an effective manner. The effort put into the story of the main character especially pays off, as gamers can easily identify with the upbringing and struggles that drive development of protagonist Wei Shen as he searches to define himself between connections with the Hong Kong Police and the gang Sun On Yee. Wei is joined by a cast of secondary characters that would generally fall into the category of ""stereotypical"", but fortunately most have some extraordinary developments or twists that keep them from becoming stale or predictable.Comparisons between Sleeping Dogs and the Grand Theft Auto series are commonplace. However, such claims made in an attempt to denigrate Sleeping Dogs is, at best, ignorant. Martial arts motifs play a significant role in the design of the gameplay here, composing the greatest difference between this and GTA. The player lacks the GTA-standard arsenal of weapons to carry around as combat is largely focused on hand-to-hand combat. Though some later levels heavily feature guns, players will largely find themseleves using combos and counters to dispatch foes. Other mechanics, ranging from a unique on-the-road hijack system to genre-standard slow-motion sequences further reinforce the kung-fu movie feel that the game is going for.Sleeping Dogs suffers from an array of technical malfunctions and limitations. The game in general works appropriately (no issues with rendering or framerate), though on rare occasion it crashed with no warning. Because the game generates cutscenes and scripted actions in the real game environment (i.e. instead of cutscenes being full video, the background of the scene is a continuation of what is going on with NPCs in the open world), unintended consequences often result. These consequences range from the hilarious (two characters showing indifference after being run over during a cutscene) to the catastrophic (being stuck behind an invisible wall after a scripted event, requiring reset). Getting stuck is moreso an issue with platforming in this game, as it attempts to emulate Assassin's Creed's parkour system, only to provide an unrefined version, leaving many instances of floating above objets or glitching around walls where one shouldn't be. Finally, the overreliance on the counter mechanism during combat makes it difficult to fight off groups of enemies as the game cannot handle many targets to counter at once. This proves especially troublesome during the beginning of the game, when Wei is too weak to take most attacks and must abuse the counter, leading to some unfair situations. This becomes less of an issue as he grows stronger in the game.In spite of this variety of issues the game faces, it was never enough to outweigh the positive experience that playing this game provided. It offers a lengthy primary campaign, bolstered by sidequests, completion goals and simple-yet-fun minigames. The Definitive Edition provides a significant amount of bonus missions and accessories to effectively bolster the length of the game after beating the main game. Additionally, it provides two scenarios seperate from the main game to play, which are both worthwhile in their own right. Though the final result of the game faced faulty implementation due to what the game was trying to accomplish, it still succeeds in providing a more visually-enthralling, narrative driven experience than is normal for action sandbox titles, and is a worthy game in any collection.

												I never play the old version of Sleeping Dogs, so I can't review the different of it.I really enjoy the story, the fighting is fluid, the animation is great, the city is alive. the graphic is good.- Audio glitch sometimes in the car, two radio play at the same time, after I leave the car, the radio still playing.- In Nightmare in North Point sometimes I punch some Jiang Shi and got it stuck under a car, then after that I can't enter the car.- I found some problematic bug/glitch with the Achievement, I need to reopen all the lockbox in Central, when I already open all 30/30 in the game, after I do reopen all the lockbox in new games, after dating at Victoria Peak, I got the achievement.Hope if there are new sleeping dogs, I need to have Taxi number in my contact, it's really help travel a lot.I'm a taxi user, sometimes npc get in, then Wei said ""Do I look like a cab driver to you?"" Good.I really enjoy the game, even I experience a bug/glitch that take me some times to get a perfect game.It's a recomended game, it's also cheaper then the previos version and also contain all the DLC.

												I didn't expect much but this games is really good. Great story, graphics, fighting and driving. Optimization is great, I can play it at 4k with high steady frames and it looks like it was made this year. It's like GTA in China. It would be worth full asking price so at a sale price it's a must buy.			"

												Absolutely recommended, especially if taken under 30 €Game very fun and different from the original edition, meaning that in the definitive edition found:-All 24 and the DLC released in the past two years-Graphics And sound definitely improved and made more lively city, with the addition of people and traffic livelier than the original-2 Additional episodes to enjoy once finished the gameThat said you can spend 50-60 hours but even more with a plot very pretty, Mafia-style where you have to do way between the mafia, but at the same time you are a cop who must fit the same for which you workEven the ending is done very well and with some twists that no advanceSure is neither lived nor did everything that could have a GTA, but will introduce you to a Hong Kong very well done and also the gameplay struggles style kung fu is very well doneAbsolutely recommended for hours of fun without tiringWe hope to continue with a new episodeRating 80/100			"

 SLEEPING DOGS: DEFINITIVE EDITION REVIEW  Have you ever wanted to play Grand Theft Auto, but set in Hong Kong with tons of Chinese themes throughout the game. Well is Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition the game for you. The game has you playing Wei Shen an undercover cop who has to start getting in good with the Sun on Yee (Hong Kong Triad) and moving up in ranks and gaining their trust, but when Wei is getting taken off the case he insists on finishing the job he started, and that's what he intends to do.The game plays very well. The combat can be very smooth, maybe not to the extent of a Batman Arkham Game, but it's alright. Gun play in Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a bit iffy and is only really acceptable when using a mouse, but I recommend the use of a controller for everything else. The cars control beautifully. Wei also feels very fluent on the ground when running and parkouring throughout Hong Kong.The game visually is pretty damn good and is a sight to behold. The original verson of Sleeping Dogs is no longer available on steam, but the definitive edition is basically the full package anyways. If you have a good enough pc to run it, it won't matter if the old version isn't available. GOOD GAME, COULD USE SOME ACTUAL SLEEPING DOGS NEXT TIME. 9.5/10  "

												Not many hours put into the PC version, but I put enough into the Xbox 360 version to know that this is a solid open world adventure. Coupled with a unique setting, a decent melee combat system and a pretty good story, it stands out from the other so-called GTA clones and deserves more recognition to be honest. Driving controls are quite bad, though. 7/10 would pork bun again			"

												I'll start this by saying that I've really enjoyed this game. A good mix between GTA and Saints Row. Story is cliche but engaging at the same time, although I was really hoping that there would be multiple endings at the end (it seemed like the story was leading to that). The game's story had the potential to top GTA's if they had put in multiple endings.GTA should do collectables like how Sleeping Dogs did it. The problem with GTA's collectables is that they had no value to it. Sleeping Dogs gave you upgrades for completing collectables. Thus, giving you the reason to go hunting them down.Combat system is one of the best for this genre, forcing you to use martial arts instead of going in guns blazing (not true for all missions, as the last few missions were gunfights). And note that I said 'for this genre'. Combat is definately not as good as the Batman series or Shadow of Mordor. And the chase scenes are amazing, as the freerunning system is simple but engaging at the same time.Problems only come in when you're trying to get all achevements and 100% the whole game. Bugs start to show, and I had to restart missions multiple times (sometimes even the whole game). Missions became tedious to do. At this point, the game got frustrating and I was playing it for the sake of completion. But this all started after the 25-30 hour mark.DLCs were mostly meh... 'Nightmare in North Point' was OK. You would probably enjoy 'Year of the Snake' if you really enjoyed the police missions in the main game.TL;DR Main story cliche but good. Brings new mechanics to the table for this genre. DLCs are meh. Game can become tedious and frustrating when trying to 100% it. Highly recommended.BTW, always remember, ""A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man.""			"

												[Disclaimer]Sigh* I had already finished this game twice but steam didnt record that time nor achievement because I didn't have internet at that time 24/7 so none of my time or achievement register. The ones you see are just me checking to make sure the game is still alright before doing my review. Game Info Name: Sleeping DogsDeveloper: United Front GamesGenre: Beat Em Up, Kung Fu, Action, Stealth, RacingPersonal Verdict: Ever wanted to put a leg up someones face? Do so in HD. What is Sleeping Dogs:Definitive Edition Originally Sleeping Dogs without the Definitive Edition tack to it this version sees square enix adding and adjusting the entire DLC released in Sleeping Dog previous version into something well errr, better. Anyways to the game itself.Sleeping Dog is a visceral game of Kung-Fu, betrayal, triads and friendship as we follow one Wei Shen as he does his job in the brilliantly rendered world of Hong Kong, Wei must choose between his allegiance to the triads or to his police officers as he delivers justice. One Kung-Fu at a time. Story Playing the story of Sleeping Dogs [SD] reminds me of the old action Kung-Fu movie where the story moves at breakneck speed and emotional rollercoaster happens all the time. Which is to say the story kick♥♥♥♥♥ It delivers them in spades and is not afraid to hold back from doing all sorts of nasties that the player will no doubt witness and feel. Graphic Usually I do not like to talk much about graphics because what the heck am I suppose to write?! Exception of course are made. Sleeping Dogs treats the world of Hong Kong is pretty bland with repetitive civilian, normal texture etc etc but it really comes alive during the night and rain! Especially night and rain together in tandem! Skins exude a sheen, cars has powerful reflection upon them and everything is generally 10x better than it is during daytime. Not to say the standard graphics are bad but upping it up and witnessing the full glory of the engine in rain and night is a breathtaking experience. Sound United Front Games pulled no punches in making sure we get the most authenthic experience for our stay in Hong Kong. Random quips in Cantonese can be heard as you walk the streets, Character that do not speak english instead does full Cantonese dialogue. The crisp clear audio makes subtitle a secondary thing as oppose to be a mandatory on for most games and every effect down to the last mission complete evoke a strangely nostalgic chinese feel. Gameplay Ah Sleeping Dogs, I turn you on, kick a few citizen stuff them into the boot of their car then kill them right in front of the hospital with my KUNG-FU. What better way to start a monday.In an otherwise typical fare of open world game Sleeping Dog does the competition shame by focusing on one aspect many game have neglected: The melee system. While initially the melee system seems easy with 1 hko object scattered all over the enviroment and enemies come in weak and puny form they soon ramp it up especially towards midgame where you will be punching, kicking and hurling foes off rail while covered in blood. Essentially press counter when enemy glow red, punch them up till they die and then when the meter is full use face mode to recover health and make your enemy fear you. Along the way explore the world! Beat up people in side activities to uncover drug raids, beat people up again to obtain chests of money and clothing. Turn Wei into the most fashion savvy freak with the game large customization option. Engage in daring fights as you beat up people to get money and more face value! Or perhaps you're a picky one eh? Want a bit of dialogue and action in your beat em up? Look no further. Turn into a cop hunt down people as you become the scourge of the underworld, help your eccentric group of buddies as they get into random hijinks that often ends with beating people up. Or you know, just help around the citizen of Hong Kong, they could use a help from a friendly people-beating gangster. But alas the gunplay fall shorts, since most resources went into fighting people up the gun lacks recoil, feels plasticky and holds no weight. Cleverly the game wave them away from most mission by stating ""HONG KONG DON'T ALLOW GUNS!"" it works for me it should works for you. The car good to say however is awesome and a joy to ride, and since you can simply steal a car it doesnt matter if you're walking on foot, simply steal a car and be on your way. Or you can use the car valet. Eh. Fun feature includes the ability to steal cars within a car without going out. Amazing when you think about it since you don't have to dismount but can happily continue your ride in a shiny new car as the wreck of your old ones burns behind you.Completing mission earns you triad points by being brutal and police point for being civilised lawful cop. Leveling up gives you a choice of perk within the skill tree. An oddly choice of collectible, side missions and all that jazz ensures you won't be bored of the game anytime soon.  Conclusion How I wish i could experience it all over again, the powerful gunfight, desperate Kung-Fu action and emotional story. Why does more game can be this way? Alas a few minor issues does bog it down though. But does this makes it a bad game? It is an excellent game released suddenly to our world. Buy it already I am tired of typing this all out. Basically this game is awesome.Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: A++ RankCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												10/10 Amazing GameI have finished the original version multiple times already and am still amazingly impressed by it's realistic feel of Hong Kong and how it's archetecture reflects on various different area's. Most would know Triads did exist around year 1950 and were incorporated into the game so realisticly and did things real triads did (Trafficing Drugs, fighting and prostitution) and being able to play through it as Wei Shen is like being in HK. Triad groups in the game were based on the real Son Yee On and 14K as they were real enemies.I love the use of stereotypes in the game and found them especially funny because i do speak Cantonese as a first language and i am astonished at how accurately dialogue in the city is put into a game where you can freely explore the vibrant culture of HK.It is a game you can keep on playing, and never get bored of.

												A suspense action-thriller, organized crime story, of a multidimensional Asian American undercover agent, whose loyalty is tested in extreme circumstances brought by a dark past he left behind.Hugely underrated, Sleeping Dogs is the surprise cult hit of 2012, and delivered an honorable tribute to masterpiece films, such as Infernal Affairs, and its Hollywood remake, The Departed.Sandbox gameplay set in a highly detailed cosmopolitan city, fully fleshed out with fresh style of slick eastern-esque aesthetics, well suited for the enigmatic Hong Kong Triad theme. Primary combat is raw hand-to-hand packed with myriad true-to-life martial techniques to employ; a feature that adds to its unique flavor when compared to GTA or Watch Dogs.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition (2014) is more than worth the asked price point.  Experience this gem today!			"

												For those waiting for GTA V or a similar open world type game, Sleeping Dogs fills the gap suitably. The structure of the game is no surprise for any GTA player, or if you have played the previous True Crime games, with the only major difference here is that the game's combat is based on a Batman-style melee approach, which is suitably fun once you get the hang of it and identify the various moves. It does get a bit repetative towards the end of the main mission set, but that's common with most open world games; there's also a good deal of completionist gathering one can go after. However, elements like the story itself are somewhat lackluster - you can get an idea where the story is heading early on, and there's not much redeeming or vile about any of the characters. The Definition Edition includes two packs of DLC, both adding another 2-3 hr each of gameplay. The second one, Year of the Snake, feels like a good single movie in terms of plot (attempting to stop a cult bombing the city), while the first one has fun elements of movies like Big Trouble in Little China in it. The only issue that I have against the game is a lack of technical updates from the publisher, which many have commented on the forums. In my case, I had started the game, and during that time had to update a completely separate hardware driver for a camera device, among other things. This caused the game to be inoperable. Only until I was at a point that I had replaced the camera with a different one, did the game then work fine. As one of the few troubleshooting tips they have given has been to disconnect all USB devices which have worked for some but not all, this might create a technical problem for you.			"

												Sleepings Dogs: Definitive Edition,Is the first game in its genre that's actually able to keep me interested. Game's like GTA and Saints Row, which do a good job on their own, don't come even close to what Sleeping Dogs offers me when it comes down to gameplay, handling, atmosphere, voice overs and hints of reality.The city of (virtual) Honk Kong is beautifully dirty and down to earth. The people all look very realistic and not like some comic book character. The cars look the way they should look: normal.There're many mini games throughout the main game and they all blend in perfectly and make sens in one way or another. It's nothing stupid, but fitting.Another good thing is that random violence is not rewarded, but rather punished. Especially when doing a mission.If you're looking for a game that's very similar to GTA or Saints Row, but want a somewhat more realistic setting, then get Sleeping Dogs. It provides action, drama, fun and visuals for content tourists; all on a very, very high level.The two DLC's that come with the definitive edition provide each 2-3 hours of extra gameplay and I've got to be honest that the ""year of the Snake"" DLC suprised me in a very positive way. That's because you're actually playing as a police officer. (Wearing the uniform and all) As which your main goal is to cover up some cultist scheme and to arrest people. (Opposite of killing)			"

												If GTA is Metallica, Fallout is Megadeth, Saints Row is Anthrax, and The Witcher is Slayer...then Sleeping Dogs is Testament. A bit lesser known than the ""Big 4"", but right up there in quality; arguably better in some aspects. It's one of those games that although has Very Positive reviews is still somewhat underrated. It's got a cult following for sure.Gameplay-wise it's like GTA with Arkham style combat. It's unique in it's setting, story, and the fact that you play as an undercover cop. There is a fair amount of variety in the main missions, and the side missions / collectibles are awesome.If I had to name negatives I'd say the camera is a bit finicky at times. Also, the character models / lip syncing are not the games strongest points.Overall, a great game that should be played by anyone remotely interested in open world games. A solid 8/10.			"

												The Definitive edition of the Sleeping Dogs game is all in all very good, Yet it has some major flaws not even the first release had. 1. Finnished missions and submissions like Thousant Cuts cannot be replayer again. There is a little left to do after the main story is finnished. I Finished everything and still didn´t reached the full XP in Triad section - now I cannot even replay the old missions in order to do them better and recieve some additional Triad XP.2. When I I pick up pistol with Wei anywhere, including the golden version which is granted after upon finnishing the main story, or even guns which are part of the costume, e.g. Hitman, S.W.A.T, etc. - for some reason Wei looses this gun when put in holster after few minuted of playing. For instance, I picked up the golden pistol at home, went to garage, took some car, drove around few blocks, then someone crashed my car, I wanted to shoot like drive-by, and I realized, I have no gun!!! This happens all the time :/3. When practicing with the wood men, there is horrible noise like crushing wood in the first few hits. And this wasn´t the problem in regular Sleeping Dogs. I believe it is some sort of bug. It would be nice if it could be fixed. "

												I probably should have left this review on the original Sleeping Dogs game, but here we go anyways. Probably contains spoilers so consider yourself warned.\\ Story:The story is an amazingly tangled mess of triad fighting and personal choices. It is going to break you down inside and i was left a crying mess throughout the game. It should be said that i am very easily attached to, and affected by things. The wedding, where the oh so sad love song always plays before♥♥♥♥♥♥is going down, Uncle Po, and not to forget the most horrible death of them all (to me at least), Jackie.. The last had me bawling my eyes out because the story and character had sucked me in (and i kinda had a minor crush on Edison Chen). Anyhow, the story is solid, A+. \\ Gameplay and graphics:The improved graphics are stunning, and almost killed my computer because i was overly confident while choosing the ultra high settings. It was definitely worth the upgrade and it was even more immersive this time around than the first. I sat for eight hours the first day and ten hours the second to finish the game and i've never gotten so sucked into anything before. The vibrant colors and the city itself feels even more realistic now. I love the random encounters with people selling art and birds and whatnot too. And the food looks so amazingly good i just keep drooling every time i look at it.The only thing that annoyed me was towards the end of the game when the car valet kept saying he was busy and couldnt deliver to you, but apart from that i have nothing negative to say. Easily one of my favorite games and one of the best i've played so far.			"

												Spoiler free review.I like this game more than gta-series. Mainly because it has more serious story. Gta is fun, but i just personally prefer more serious approach. The story tells of an undercover cop, infiltrating and destroying a triad organization from within, but eventually, he becomes friends with them, and starts to notice, they might not be as bad as he thought. They're just humans, with relationship, and hardships in life that drove them to the criminal path.I really liked this aspect, it wasn't the basic ""good guys are good guys, and bad guys are bad guys"" type of setting. It was an interesting plot to follow.The city itself is lively, fun to explore, parkour aspect contributes to the joy of exploring, and gives new areas where to go. Sidequests are plenty, helping people, learning new martial art moves and hunting for collectibles. There's also police missions, in addition to the triad ones. But it seems they didn't really explore how they wuold collide, like really give a hint that you're on the danger of revealing yourself to the triad during the police missions.------------------The DLC-------------------------Definitive edition comes with all of them, of course. The first being integrate into the game, the zodiac tournament, is a fun little nod to Bruce Lee, and the one i found most enjoyable of the 3 biggest story dlc's. Nightmare in North Point is a horror themed, little and short dlc set only in North point, not much story. My second favorite of these ones.The last one, year of the snake continues from the main story, basically for the intro video. It was a big letdown, i mean a BIG. After the intro video, it's just mainly cop missions from the main game, put one after atnoher, and after few of them, it's done. That's it. There's some minor story dialoque in some ""missions"", when Wei is driving a car and talking on the phone for example. It seemed to me, that it was putten together hastily. When Zodiac tournament and Nightmare had more proper feel to them.			"

												Probably one of the greatest, if not THE greatest underrated game ever. I've replayed this 3 times on the PS3, 4 times on the PS4, and now going through my 2nd playthrough on PC. This game has a nice blend of badass kung-fu with equally badass gunfights. The story is great. You infiltrate, as an undercover officer of the law, into a ruthless Chinese Triad syndicate in Hong Kong, surrounded by people you knew in your childhood, and you must take down the entire Triad syndicate using legal and morally right methods, however, you also have a grudge against some of these guys, for what they did to your sister. The story, fighting, and side activites (which could've been better but are still fun to do) made me drawn to this game. It's great, and at $7.50, it's a steal.			"

												After playing through this game I can safely say it is one of those titles anyone must play.Sleeping dogs doesn't attempt to be a GTA or Saints Row clone. It has it's own vibe. Including being set in a sort of underrepresented setting: Modern day Hong Kong. The amount of variation of scenery is pretty nice for the size of the map.The story is in no way generic, either. Expect a nice variety of missions. The presentation is straight on and the controls are very fluid. Dealing with mobs of enemies using Kung-Fu never felt more satisfying, rewarding you for knowing when to strike, for how long and when to counter.The main storyline is about 10 hours of gameplay long, but the side cases and expansions most certainly add a lot to that.Definitely get this and play it.

												Definitly one of the best games for me :). Been a fan of the TrueCrime series from the first game. Sleeping dog's story is great! I teared up more then one time and it just moved me. The hand to hand combat is nice not perfect but good non the less. The open world activities are not much unfortunatly, but adds something to do when you just want to crause in your cool car or bike and take a look at the BEATIFULY made world :3. I recomend it :)			"

												Nice and pretty smooth. After comparing both versions. Definitive Edition has better lighting, response, and control. Some of the glitches are still there with AI and main character. Overall I would still recommend the game to those that never bough the original. DLC's are included, except they are apart of the story line. Unlike the Original Version, Once you bought certain DLC's, the clothing or vehicles would be easily/readily accesible, not in this edition, you have to work (i.e. buy them) for them.			"

												If you have played the original Sleeping Dogs released back In 2012 then you're probaly wondering why you should get the game again,well simply put the game Is amazing and Is more detailed and better looking then ever.The lighting In this game Is absolutely amazing and Is noticeable especially at night and when It Is raining,plus with the addition of Volumetric Fog you really feel like you're In Hong Kong.Also another Inprovement over the original release Is the Increase of NPC's roaming the street's of Hong Kong,more pedestrian's walking and the Increase of traffic throughout the city really bring's the game to life and give's you the feeling of the reality of everyday Hong Kong,the Night Market was one of my favourite place's In the game due to the fact that It Is absolutely crowded with NPC'S and you can constantly hear people yelling out to either yourself or other NPC'S trying to sell food or clothing,It make's you feel like you're In the everyday market's that are packed In Hong Kong.From the story's point of view I think It Is very well done and It Is really Interesting,I wasn't bored at any point during the game and the action got better and better as the story progressed,I would buy this game again just for the sake of the story alone because It Is very good.From the technical point of the game It Is extremely well optimized with a constant 60FPS! at 1080P however the extreme Anti Aliasing setting which use's SSAA Is extremely demanding and i would turn the setting down to high as I noticed no major difference in picture quality but did get better performance,also there was no game breaking bug's or freeze's.I would recommended this game to everybody,the story Is absolutely solid!,there Is plenty and I mean plenty of side mission's,collectibles and DLC's to be enthralled In.and also lot's of action packed fun exploring Hong Kong.So would I recommend people who bought the original Sleeping Dogs back In 2012 to buy the game again,absolutely!  If you never played Sleepings Dogs before,well then you must buy this game,It Is a one of a kind game and to both fan's and newcomer's of the game,It truly Is the Definitive Edition!			"

												I've already reviewed the regular edition, so I've moved that review over with a few additional Definitive Edition-specific comments. The good: This is one of my favorite games, so I could probably fill a page with ""the good."" I find the story line extremely enjoyable. Being an undercover cop gives you a chance to cause mayhem while not feeling like a total dirtbag. The interactions between the player & NPCs are fun, and the voice acting is good. The setting and story really make you pull for a lot of different sides and think about life and family. The atmosphere is excellent. Hong Kong feels very vibrant and alive. The fighting system is one of my favorites. There are few guns available in this game; instead, the game mostly relies on martial arts. There's a gym where you can practice your moves before you take on street thugs and rival triads. The bad: The driving is kind of awful. I've tried it with a controller and liked it slightly better, but it still wasn't great. However, once you get used to it, it's playable, if a little frustrating. I thought the main campaign was rather short. It's an open world game with lots of side quests, but the way each of the main quests comes up sort of gives you an urgency that can push you through the game at a faster pace. I raced through a lot of the main quest and suddenly went, oh, that's the end? Definitive Edition comments: Almost all of the DLCs from the original edition were bundled into the Definitive Edition. They removed the (what I considered to be) game-breaking DLCs that gave you tons of money and XP right at the beginning, so the game progresses in a much more natural fashion now. All the outfits previously added by the DLCs are available for purchase at the Night Market; Wheels of Fury missions are now spread out so that you don't gain a super OP car immediately. The textures, graphics, and higher population density of the Definitive Edition may cause performance issues on some systems. I have an Nvidia graphics card and had to play with my settings to get the game to run on that card rather than my integrated graphics. General info: The open world provides ample opportunity for exploration and side quests. The story is great and the world is very atmospheric (Hong Kong makes a nice change from the generic cities a lot of games are set in). The art style is fairly good (better with the HD textures). Overall: I would definitely recommend this game! If you haven't played it yet, you need to!System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

												Sleeping Dogs takes you on a blood-spattered journey through the violent Hong Kong underworld as undercover cop Wei Shen, a man torn between two worlds and not wholly of either one. The game is a sandbox crime sim and is closer to Grand Theft Auto then to Saints Row in terms of gameplay, but is generally more enjoyable to play then the former. It does however lack any kind of multiplayer, which I am sure would be very offputting for some. While it places a much lower emphasis on shooting then most games in the genre, it flavors its gunfights with bullet time- but most of the time, Wei engages his foes with a brutal combination of strikes, counters and throws, coupled with some very painful-looking environmental finishers (table saws, spikes, furnaces, fan blades- the list goes on) You unlock additional melee techniques along the way and while the fights may eventually get stale and lack the tactical depth of say, the Batman: Arkham games, they remain a cut above the drunken flailing that passes for melee in GTA V. Unlike the purely aesthetic clothing options in GTA V, clothing in Sleeping Dogs can provide bonuses when worn as a set.  Driving is manageable, though most the cars do not handle very well and you will find yourself grinding a lot of hard surfaces at speed. However, you have the ability to jolt your car left, right or forwards to ram other cars, which is both useful and entertaining. Bullet time also kicks in when aiming a gun from a car, making engaging pursuers infinitely easier. As per standard for the genre, there are a multitude of collectables scattered about the map. While the lockboxes reward only some money and occasionally clothes and the security camera hacks offer no reward at all, the shrines confer a maximum health upgrade for every five shrines found and are absolutely vital, as finding them all doubles Wei's starting health. Luckily, you unlock the ability to see the shrines on your map early on, and like GTA V, the entire city is available to explore at the start, barring only a few story mission-only areas.  This ""definitive"" edition of the game includes almost all of the DLCs- fair enough, considering the vanilla edition is no longer available (Wow Squarenix, really?) These include a number of extra outfits, vehicles and missions that if used/done during the course of a playthrough will make the core content much easier, especially the police tactical gear that cuts all damage you take in half. There are a pair of mini-story addons, one dealing with a prototype, gatling-equipped supercar and the other a martial arts tournament ripped straight out of Enter the Dragon, which offers up some of the most difficult melee fights in the game. Money is also no object beyond the first few hours of the story, beginning with the fact that you can run over parking meters to get it! There are also a pair of full story addons: Nightmare on North Point is your standard horror-flavored DLC that has you fighting Jiang Shi vampires, Yaoguai demons and the ghosts of enemies fought in the main campaign. The second, Year of the Snake, sees Wei back on the force and combating a bomb-crazy doomsday cult on Chinese New Year's. While Nightmare has new enemies and Snake has some good gunfights, both DLCs are somewhat repetitive and are not up to the same quality as the core campaign. They are, however, short enough that they do not overstay their welcome. Though I played these addons after completing the story, you may wish to complete Year of the Snake earlier on as it adds a tear-gas grenade launcher to your main playthrough. Overall, I enjoyed Sleeping Dogs and found it more then worth its lowered price. If you enjoy sandbox crime games, Sleeping Dogs is certainly worth your time.			"

												One of the most highly underrated open-world action single player game to come out.  The story is based on a lot of similarties to most HK typical traid vs traid vs police.  However the story is very well done and well paced.  The melee combat is fun and fluid once you get the hang of it and does not take long.  The gunplay is very familair to max payne, which is a good thing.  The graphics still holds up really well with this definitive edition even though this game is almost 5 years old.  The city looks amazing at night with all the lights and reflections. The city really feels alive with lots of npcs, cars,stores, attractions, etc.  Also if you do play in very high resolution like 2k or 4K like myself, there is a UI scale option which is perfect.The voice acting are excellent.  Some very big name in the asian film industry gave the voices to the game and really shines during cutscenes.  The soundtrack also very good.  With mix of chinese traditional music, to hip-hop, instrumentals, dance, and pop songs.   I often took longer route to my destination just to hear more of the music, which says a lot.  Car controls well and is definately way better than most open world and even more of the recent releases.  This game really didn't get a lot of attention when it first released but it should not be missed.  One of the best sleeper hit to come out in the past 5 years.			"

												Sleeping Dogs was originally released on August 13, 2012 for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC. It was recently released on Xbox One and PS4 as well. It was developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. It received a 9 out of 10 on Steam, 4 out of 5 on Metacritic and an 8.5 out of 10 on IGN.While most people consider Sleeping Dogs a GTA knock off set in Hong Kong, I would argue that perception is false. While the initial concept is the same, an open world crime game, the basic mechanics of Sleeping Dogs sets it apart. These mechanics include cop/triad alliances, a focus on melee combat, and a Max Payne esque bullet time when sliding over objects during gun play.Because of the great implementation of the aforementioned mechanics, the smaller size of the open world compared to similar releases such as GTA and Watch_Dogs, still provides a fantastic experience.The story in follows an ex San Francisco cop that has been thrown back into the world of the Triads in modern day Hong Kong. While the story may seem cliche at first, if you give it some time you will find a rewarding plot line to follow.The Definitive Edition includes six downloadable content packages for your consumption, and with the current holiday sale on Steam, is well worth the additional cost.

												~ One of the best games that I have ever played! ~It's a gorgeous 3rd person shooter! It includes a ton of DLC, which are rebalanced and properly integrated into the game's story, unlike the standard edition of Sleeping Dogs. The DLC do not give you an unfair advantage anymore. Also, some DLC are unlocked as you progress through the main story and there are two more DLC that can be accessed from the Main Menu, which are separated from the main game.It's a great PC port, featuring DX11 support and an integrated high-res texture pack.  For me, it was a real pleasure driving around this fictional Hong Kong, killing bad guys and enjoying the beautiful storyline :)			"

												While I like the graphical improvements and other tweaks, I must say I'm somewhat disappointed with the lack of bug fixes.  There's a few times where you can fail a mission randomly due to bad AI (ie: if you have an ally driving for you and they flip the car) or just some inexplicable auto-fails.  Nonetheless, the concept of the game is very appealing and is mostly well done.  It doesn't have the same polish as GTA in some ways but the martial arts combat system and parkour is way more advanced than what GTA has.  One terrible thing in this game is that you can't seem to hail a cab without car jacking half the time.  Nobody thought of using  another button for the car jacking?  Bugs and minor headaches aside, it's definitely a buy if you haven't played the original version and love games like GTA and Saints Row.			"

												Had some pretty serious graphics issues with this game until I got a 144hz monitor. Many false starts due to graphics issues. Finally gave this a good shot, and I am not sorry I did.This game is one of the better GTA style games. Some familiar concepts but it brings a lot of new ideas to the table. Playing as an undercover cop is a new way of looking at these crime sim games, and adds a level of character complexity to the game. If you have this in your library and never really started it, (I can see many of you do on my  friends list) give this another shot.			"

												I have played the original Sleeping Dogs quite a bit since 2013 and it has grown to be one of my favorite games of all time. So much so that I figured it would be a crime if I did not buy the new Definitive Edition. After play for an hour, I have to say that I am impressed by the Definitive Edition. Right off the bat, the menu is ultra-sharp, even in 1920x1080p. Even the menu sounds and menu music quality have been improved! The introduction is better than ever; I had an absolute BLAST with the new destruction mechanics in the beginning chase and fights. I threw an enemy at a cabinet and the drawers of the cabinet actually came out and papers flew out. Then, I slammed a metal gate in the market on top of an enemy and it actually bent in the middle. This kind of stuff never happened before... I love it! The electronic street signs have been improved (all the textures too) to make Hong Kong look better than ever. The rain effects look phenomenal, and I have realized that the map, loading dragon, in-game floating HUD icons, etc. are almost 4k sharp. Many other elements of the game have been improved as wellIf you already have Sleeping Dogs and love it to death (and have extra money), get it. If you have not played it at all, get it. If you already have the Definitive Edition, play it! :)			"

												It's a really good GTA clone that recreates the tone of classic Cantonese action flicks. What makes it interesting is that it incorporates an Arkham-style martial arts fight system with the guns and cars.Note that this ""definitive"" edition comes with all of the DLC they ever produced, and a lot of it is way off tone from the base game. The costume/moveset addons let you conduct undercover police operations dressed as Wukong the monkey king, or cosplaying as Jensen from Deus Ex. There's a series of optional missions in which you build a ridiculous Bond car with an EMP generator and dual minigun turrets. The story DLCs are also pretty zany. There's an optional mission where you get sucked into a '70s kung fu grindhouse movie, and an expansion that's a horror comedy about an invasion of hopping vampires. So if you're big on immersion and just want to stick to the Infernal Affairs-style cop movie storyline you'll probably want to avoid doing any of the DLC.If you're looking for an open world game without any of GTA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is definitely worth buying during a sale.

												Surprised at how much I enjoyed Sleeping dogs. Liked the heavy emphasis on martial arts and the story is interesting by making the main protagonist serve as a double agent. Gunplay however feels a little awkard and some the side missions can be completed so fast that you wonder why they included them in the first place. Overall though, it's a great game.			"

												I read that a lot of people compare it to GTA. Since I don't play GTA, this review will try to cover and talk about aspects that maybe GTA has too. Therefore, sorry if some of the points may look, from your point of view, like something to be expected from a 2014 game and shouldn't be seen as selling points.The plot is truly interesting, and although is widely known that you take the role of an undercover cop, things are not as plain as it may seem. You're not an average undercover cop, you're a person suited to fill that role, with a particular psychological profile. You'll infiltrate in a main branch of the Triad, in Hong Kong, and things won't go as smooth as you'd like. That profile won't help and you'll get caught in something a bit more deep, a bit more scary, a bit more of your own.It won't be about choosing sides, it will be more about merging in both, without leaving any trace, nor any part of you.It will be more about swimming inside a stream, while trying not to follow its flow.Gameplay - Wise, I didn't feel disappointed at all. The environment is gorgeus, accurate, colourful yet gray. Turns, hills, alleys, signs.Driving is fun but steering is a must, and makes things more exciting. Shame there aren't many car models. You can't steal a car and make it yours by driving it into your parking lot, but you'll own many cars, obtained by buying them or by doing main missions and / or side missions. Same applies for motorcycles.While cars can't be customized, noone says that you can't steal them and drive them through all Hong Kong, shooting at other cars' tires or directly at their front window. Aim well for a clean headshot, will you? Or if you feel like you need a new car, keep putting the pedal to the metal, jump from your seat to the roof of your new love interest or hit them until they'll stop driving.And there will be lot of pursuits. Relentless pursuits. Be it in North Point or in the highway, drive wherever you want, just get rid of the pursuers. This is one of the things I liked most from the game, as it's one of the few cases where you'll hold a firearm and you'll see cars exploding.Because what has been seen by many as a flaw, my eyes and my racing heart tells me otherwise.Firearms are rare, very rare so that you won't feel overpowered and start a killing spree. You'll treasure them and hide them. You won't waste bullets and you'll scavenge a lot. And you'll enjoy the moment when you'll use your gun to set a car on fire, or while taking cover behind a counter, against a volley of bullets.Gunfires will make you remind that you're made of flesh, so don't try to run against your enemies. Take cover and plan the right time to shoot.This scarce source of guns makes hand-to-hand combat the way to clean the path ahead of you. Keep countering, break their arms, thair legs, their teeth. Use everything at your disposal: a fan, a swordfish, a boiler, a railing, or take them hostages and use their bodies as shields, or put them inside the boot; they may change their minds.There's still more, but I don't think I should spoil everything.Secondary missions are interesting, they add layers to an already thick background, encouraging you to live this game more deeply, on both sides of the same coin.They will encourage you to explore to the fullest the map, uncovering favors, races, secrets and so on.Buy it, because I didn't tell you everything, and because it deserves more sunlight than shades.

												A very good game, it's very addictive and enjoyable to play. I recommend if you enjoy open world games like GTA and Saints Row, it's simular to that, but unlike those games that are US based, Sleeping Dogs is refreshingly oriental, based in Hong Kong. With good martial arts combat.This is a open world game, with martial arts, crime, street racing, gambling,  with main missions, various side quests and hunting for collectibles. You don't get to use guns till later on.The main character you play as is Wei Shen a undercover cop who infiltrates and works with the triads to try and take them down, so you get to partake in criminal activities without really being a criminal and find yourself getting deeper into the criminal world. The story is very good and I could not help but feel sad when certain things happened even though they are criminals.The driving in the game at first feels terrible, until you get cars with better handling.Only thing I really hated was the phone tracing mini game, at first I did not get what I had to do, you have a limited time to trace the person and I kept failing it and having to start it all over again. And even when I did get it, it usually takes me a couple of tries as it does not give you enough time.The only thing  that was a bit weird was that enemies can put their fists up to block, but Wei has no block ability, he can only use counter on most attacks used on him.I didn't experience any major glitches or problems with this game.I had minor glitches such as a few times when entering a car Wei would get flung away from the car, causing a mission to fail as it said I left the area :pWith the DLC's they are short and I enjoyed Nightmare in North Point, it had an overall creepy feel to it.  Year of the Snake even shorter and not as fun. Zodiac Tournament was alright, a bit annoying.It's good that the DLC is included in the definitive addition as to me they don't seem worth paying extra for as they are very short and don't have much content and are more like tacked on side missions. And the bad thing about the Dlc's is they are seperate from the main game and you can't use clothing and cars that you have previously bought so you end up stuck with only boring police vehicles in your garage when you play the year of the snake and no awesome DZS-90 wheels of fury car.Short DLC aside This is a must play game, a game is really good to me when I can't stand the thought that it's going to end. I highly recommend this game. 8/10 a must play.			"

												Sleepy Dogs is one of my all time favorite open world games. I played this game for the first time last year and promised myself that I would eventually buy all of the DLC and replay the game eventually.  When the Definitive edition came out, I knew I had to get it immediately.  The DE sprinkles the newly unlocked DLC throughout the story so you are not immediately over powered at the start with crazy guns/cars/money.  That was a very good thing and added much to the overall gameplay.  The graphic upgrade was a nice touch as well.  In all, if you are thinking about buying Sleeping Dogs the DE is definitely the one to get.2015 Edit: After playing GTA 5, I can safely say that I enjoyed my time with this game more than Grand Theft Auto. I wish that Sleepy Dogs could have a touch more of the amazing world building that GTA has. But that's it. I S ranked this game and would STILL be willing to take another spin in the world of Sleepy Dogs.			"

												The game is very good overall, espicially the amount of NPCs, the smoke ffect and the story line. The something that needs improvement is it that they should find real Hong Kong people as voice actors (the Cantonese has a terrible English accent and I know because I am from Hong Kong), the map should be bigger, the buildings should be more advanced (the real Hong Kong is way much more developed than the ""Hong Kong"" in the game) and the textures should be edited by people that knows Chinese since the words on top of a meat store actually means bread store. Introducing the technology of HBAO+ and TXAA to the game will also be a good idea and I extremely recommend people to buy it.			"

												If you're familiar with the  True Crime series, this is the spiritual successor! absolutely beautiful graphics, gripping story line, lovable characters, fun combat system(almost like the PS2 classic  The Warriors ) though not to be mistaken for a GTA clone, there are firefights, this game is mainly filled with hand-to-hand combat, kung-fu style! with added environmental attacks (which can be pretty gruesome, if gore isn't your thing)The DLCs leave a little something to be desired, and feel quite rushed, but they are still worth checking out for your Sleeping Dogs fix! There are a tonne of side-quests, collectibles, cars, and clothes to collect/buy also! I have bought this game for PS3, Xbox and PC twice, it is absolutely stunning, and I 100% recommend it!			"

												Graphic is improved obviously. But the control is not as good as the original Sleeping Dogs I played 1 year ago. First is the control, its  not as responsive as before, plus the camera is a bit frustrating, its hard to adjust the camera when I am driving. And button mapping is different than the original Sleepiong Dogs, I like the original button mapping, E for hijack/talk/interact, right click for counter, and space for running/ramming vehicle/climbing. In this definitive edition, counter/hijack/ interact is the same buttong. Running and climbing using left shift, took a while to adjust the control. Not serious problem, but it could be better. I like the fighting mechanism in this game, tho the unresponsive control sometimes makes me go into rage, I can still manage my mental state good enoughThe game's content is great, worth the price, but why does it have to be vampires? And Wei only has his fist to fight the vampires and sword (sometimes) only to kill demon, this is Wei too much man. 5 vampires jumped at me, I counter, the result of unresponsive control, got bitten a lot, and when u are faced with 5 vampires and the jiang shi, a little bit chaos. Last is the clothing, why does 1 outfit has to be worn as 1, I can wear them separately. Dont like it. And the super fast police car is tied to the side mission only. Cmon, it would be fun to be able to ride this epic fast car in a free roam and mess with the police when I'm in it. And when it comes to driving in a race with super fast car, get ready to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Remember the camera? Yeah, the camera is the main enemy here. I am going to buy a controller for this game, I hope it would improve my in game experience.Conclusion, recommended, but only if you didnt buy the original one. "

												2013 - Rushed through campaign and really enjoyed the gangsta/cop story, 24 achievements.2016 - Bought the definitive edition on sale and played all of the content. 59 achievements and didn't get tired of the game until I had to get 30 gold awards + 5 for the Nightmare In Northpoint DLC which was actually pretty fun for about an episode or 2's worth of time.So the reason I went back to this game and 100 percented it.I love this game. It's as simple as that honestly. Sleeping Dogs has a great Oriental Cop/Gangster story, its like Super Cop meets Enter the Dragon meets some badass movie with Triad gangsters in it. You are Wei Shen an undercover cop bent on infiltrating the Triad and bringing down the worst of them for justice and possibly revenge. Sure the gameplay is a GTA clone but honestly why would you care? The GTA series were great games and Sleeping Dogs is the Oriental cousin GTA never really had. The story has a good familiar feel to it and is a little predictable at some points but this shouldnt discourage you if you are a fan of the genre. The extra content from the DLC's are fun concepts especially Nightmare In Northpoint, I wasn't a fan of Year of the Snake but I feel like outside of story content the Wheels of Fury DLC made up for what YoTS lacked and that is the DZS-90 (please drive irresponsibly).Combat is very fun throughout the game but can get very repetitious as per usual with this genre. also I loved the missions, most of them are quick and easy and somewhat challenging. Alot of costumes you get from the extra content directly affect your combat strength/XP gains.Dating in the game is a means to an end and the only regretful aspect.The achievement system is actually super easy. They are a little grindy but easily doable.Thanks for reading this short review I give this game 8/10 enjoy!			"

												Before I start my review of this product, I would like to mention that this is one of my first gaming experiences on the PC and this game has won me over. At the time of reviewing this, I have put in 90 or so minutes into the game so you could consider this a first impressions review. OverviewSleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is a revamp of Sleeping Dogs with improved graphics. Wei Shen finds himself at ends when he gets in too deep with the gangs of Hong Kong as you work undercover for the police to infiltrate the Sun On Yee gang. Rating/Topic+ GraphicsLet's start at the graphics, which is a selling point for the definitive edition. The game looks amazing and the city of Hong Kong has a feeling of immersion like nothing I have played before. The graphics are great and they do live up to the marketing of the definitive edition. Overall, this department is solid. - ControlsMy second topic is the controls for keyboard and mouse. I really am not a fan of them, but I don't like KB&M for most third person games either. I guess they are okay if you are good with a keyboard and mouse in third person games, but I found it to be a much better experience on the Xbox One controller. The game recognized the controller immediately and I was very satisfied without needing to change any of the default controls. The KB&M controls aren't as stellar as the graphics, but they are decent. I recommend a controller to get the best experience for this game.+ Storyline The storyline is a modern masterpiece. I have played only 90 minutes, yet I can say that the story has excellent pacing and makes you think about your actions. I went in playing the game like GTA, but every car you steal and every rival thug you beat up alters your opinion and immerses you into the game like nothing I have experienced. I can't emphasize how enjoyable it is to play this game. After a session of gaming, I sit back as if I am Wei Sheng and contemplate my actions like the game is real life. Overall, the story is amazing and is a huge selling point of this game.+ CombatThe combat is simple enough for me as someone who does not play fighting games, I found the combat sequences to be at a good middle ground for difficulty. The camera shakes as you slam someone against the wall and you can feel each hit you put on your opponent. The AI is great and thugs will be less likely to attack you when you push one of their face's into a fan or smash someone against a telephone booth. This game is great at immersing you into every aspect of the game. In all, the combat is just as solid as the graphics and storyline. Other Notes+ The soundtrack fits the theme very well+ Traffic and NPC's are very realistic, a must for a game set in one of the biggest cities in the world- Driving feels a bit clunky+/- Little to no gun combat, which could be a plus or minus depending on how you feel+ Definitive Edition includes all DLC's+/- Okay optimization, got a stable 60 FPS on high @ 1920x1080 on an OEM GTX 760, which gets 4-5 frames per second lower than a normal 760. Quick pro tip here, running this game on the Extreme preset enabled will turn on high SSAA & FXAA, which will eat up your FPS without providing much visual difference. Best to use a custom preset and switch to high FXAA and medium SSAA. SummarySleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition lives up to it's claim of improved graphics and delivers a very enjoyable gaming experience, but the keyboard and mouse experience is not the best. I recommend a controller, and be weary that the Extreme graphic preset enables high super sampling anti-aliasing which will eat up FPS, I recommend using a custom setup and use medium SSAA and high FXAA if you have a mid-tier graphics card such as the 270X or 760. I would happily recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed games such as GTA, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs or any of the Batman games. It isn't the most recent title, but the definitive edition includes all the DLC's and the updated graphics are on par with 2014 releases. My overall rating for this game is a very sold 9/10.			"

												Wanna learn kung fu? Ez, play this game. Why even attack the enemy when you can always counter his attacks?? Although there were not any actual dogs sleeping in-game, that isn't really a deal breaker for me. Its a 3rd person open world game which many will refer as a ""cheap ripoff of GTA"".. if you encounter any of those people you should tell them to stfu and ♥♥♥♥♥ slap them because it isn't. The story is good (but 2 short 4 me) and in the definitive edition graphics have been improved, fighting mechanism is awesome just like the ones you can find in the batman series. The only downside for me is that the driving is a bit stiff (just like ♥♥♥♥ing watch dogs♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hell..). And also the game is set in Hong Kong which is what makes the game unique and more fun. Overall I rate this game 9/11 as it totally deserves it.			"

												+ Great game for Hong Kong movie fans+ Great game for people who speak cantonese or read Chinese+ Fighting mechanics are awesome+ Driving mechanics is so-so, but YOU CAN SHOOT OUT OF THE WINDOWS+ Environmental kills <---+ Great tone setting music+ Visuals, story, fun mini games etc- Story feels too short- Non Chinese speakers not getting full experience- Too much cursing in cantonese. I don't think Hong Kong is like that- Sequel not announced... yet			"

												Sleeping Dogs: DE edition is why steam needs more review options than either yes/no -  Sleeping Dogs is a game that I would give a neutral review on,  the gameplay has varied amount of issues and bugs but also occasionally is great fun to play.  Sleeping Dogs is the epitome of take two steps forward and three steps backwards, hopefully SE will decide on making a sequel and address many of the issues that keep Sleeping Dogs from being a masterpiece. +Great Graphics+Great setting and story+Good fighting mechanics+Plenty of action sequences+Lots of side missions+Good voice actors-Poor racing missions, especially bike races-Questionable vehicle handling-Many bugs and occasional crashes-Poor gunplay-Frustrating missions-Useless weapons especially gunsThere are many questionable design flaws in Sleeping Dogs which really don't help the game, such as several highly useless abilities like access police weapons from the trunks of police cars, alls this does is immediately start a police chase, not that the guns will help you since they'll disappear if you interact with the world - yes, you heard that currently since SE constantly defend the fact that this is a melee based game, they state that guns are a 'power-up' but that doesn't explain why if I use a health shrine or open a box, or do anything other than shoot the gun will mysteriously disappear - this renders all the DLC that have bonus weapons completely useless. Hong Kong looks great - plenty of eye candy all around but even so, SE fails to go beyond that - the character customization is limited, clothing is limited with few giving XP or special boosts.   Car customization is non-existant which is a shame and doesn't really make that much sense since a large portion of content revolves around illegal street racing, which brings up another major issue - the racing is exceptionally poor, the car races are 100% based on picking the correct car for the race, its as simple as that - whilst the bike racing is mind blowing bad, your rival racers seem to ride ungodly powerful bikes that go significantly faster, have insanely perfect handling around tight spaces and have godly acceleration, the only chances the player has to win the bike races is to have the best bikes and to drive the race with perfection, no crashes, no drift errors - as your rivals will slow down at certain parts allowing you to get in front, and then catch just as quickly. In closing,  whilst I'm giving this a recommedation, this game does have its issues so I would rather give it a mixed review rather than a purely postive one.   I would say this game is worth a purchase if on sale or cheap but be aware of potential issues.			"

												vety dissapointing really. SD normal edition is great because of optimization and CF/SLI support. this edition don't seem to go above 30 fps no matter what settings you use. and is not CF/SLI friendly like the normal edition. i understand that better graphics means more requirments, but should still get over 30fps. the DLC is all now part of the game it's self. you now have to open everything up by doing all the missions.  so it's not directly added to your inventory. you also have to purchase it from a NPC in the game and alot of the stuff is priced at insane prices like 350,000+ for a single outfit from the DLC that you gust get in the normal version.IMO this is an ""OK"" version. but i don't recommend it, if you can get the original with all the DLC. i know steam no longer sells it. but you can buy the original through♥♥♥♥♥or another reseller for steam games.normal edition 10/10definitive edition 6/10			"

												It seems like every other game these days is an open-world affair, and if you’re looking to explore an urban environment – cars, guns, and crime included – you might first think of such titles as Grand Theft Auto V or Watch Dogs. For the more adventurous, however, comes the rerelease of a 2012 hit; Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition sees the game with a whole host of tweaks and updates, plus the inclusion of DLC content. It’s a worthy contender in a strong genre, but unfortunately remains a long way from being graphically spectacular or particularly innovative.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition will see you stepping into the shoes of Wei Shen, a police officer going undercover in the Sun On Yee triad. The story is an engrossing affair, a tale of loyalty, betrayal and duty set against the vibrant background of Hong Kong. Shen’s emotional turmoil is the real driving force behind the game, as he is promoted within the triad from foot soldier to “Red Pole”, or lieutenant, and struggles to walk the narrow line between crime and the law, committing terrible acts in order to maintain his cover, and all in the name of the greater good. It’s a story full of emotional highs and lows, with twists and turns aplenty to keep you interested. Perhaps the biggest character in the piece is not Shen, however, but Hong Kong itself. The city is visually fascinating, a warren of shady alleyways and broad highways, of clubs and skyscrapers and cluttered neon signs all battling for your attention. It’s a welcome change from the usual American cities where open-world games are set, and by game’s end you’ll be sad to be leaving it behind.There are plenty of vehicles you can use to traverse Hong Kong, including cars, motorbikes, vans and boats; you can even catch a taxi if you’re feeling particularly lazy. The missions are varied and largely good fun, and put Shen’s various abilities to good use. There’s a good amount of free-running and martial arts to be done, along with car chases, street racing and a fair bit of gunplay. Some missions are slower paced and show a playful side to the game; taking girls on dates, for example, can involve such silliness as taking photos at the park, singing karaoke, or even just driving a fast car really, really fast. A nice touch is how the gameplay mirrors the story. As the stakes become bigger, so too do the missions. The first few hours are largely given over to hand-to-hand combat and simple challenges, and it’s several hours in before Shen even picks up a gun. The bigger set pieces – gun battles in the streets, car chases which see Shen leaping from vehicle to vehicle – are saved for the important moments. This means the game never stays static, always building and growing and offering something new with each hour that goes by.The gameplay itself is remarkably intuitive. Inevitable comparisons to the Batman: Arkham games must be made when it comes to the combat, which is simple but has a great deal of depth. There’s a button for attacking, a button for grappling, and a button for countering enemy strikes; using the three in combination showcases Shen’s martial arts skills with some serious aplomb. You can also perform environmental attacks, such as slamming people into phone booths or impaling them (yes, this one’s true) on a pile of swordfish heads. It’s a system which works well but never becomes so convoluted that you’ll press the wrong button at a crucial moment. The rest of the gameplay follows suit. Free-running involves simply holding the run button down and then tapping it when you come to an obstacle. Using guns is much the same as any third-person shooter, with a simple cover system and an array of weapons including machine guns and grenade launchers. Driving vehicles is well balanced; each one has a distinct feel, but they are largely easy to control and you won’t find yourself careering off course for no apparent reason.You can also develop Shen’s abilities over time. You earn two types of experience for each mission based on your performance; one is “Cop” experience and the other is “Triad”. These can be put towards unlocking new skills in their respective trees, and you can also add new moves to Shen’s repertoire at a martial arts school if you find the requisite items. There is also something called “Face” experience, which is gained by helping people around the city and lets you obtain new clothes and cars. Some of the missions to improve this can seem trivial – delivering someone’s lunch, for example, seems a strange task for a triad lieutenant – but do help to add yet more variety to the game.Largely speaking, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is an excellent effort. It weaves a fascinating narrative and it’s fun to play, with a good amount of content to sink your teeth into. The main story takes a good fifteen to twenty hours to complete, and there are side missions galore on top of it. What problems there are tend to be exceedingly minor. Some of the character animations are stiff and unrealistic, but with a voice cast including talents such as Tom Wilkinson, Emma Stone and Lucy Liu, you won’t much notice. Occasionally a car will appear from nowhere, necessitating evasive action (or else a spectacular high-speed crash) but this only happened once or twice while I was playing.The biggest problem with Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is that it simply doesn’t feel like a game for the new generation of consoles. Despite all its many tweaks and improvements over the original, it doesn’t feel like they’ve made a great deal of difference. When The Last of Us was ported to PlayStation 4 it looked like it belonged there, but Sleeping Dogs doesn’t achieve the same feat. Graphically, it looks like a PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 game. The gameplay may be better balanced but unless you’ve played the original this simply won’t make an impact on you. Furthermore, for those who did play the original there doesn’t seem much point in upgrading. The major DLCs which come packaged with the Definitive Edition aren’t particularly long and aren’t as engrossing as the main game. The best is probably Nightmare at North Point, which breaks canon to pit Shen against ghostly gangster Smiley Cat and his army of the undead. Hong Kong takes on a dark, supernatural feel and the plot displays a wicked sense of humour, but there isn’t a great deal of variety to it and it only takes a couple of hours to complete. The other major DLC, Year of the Snake, is similar in length but extremely short on story; it offers only a threadbare reason to carry out a few new missions and extend your time in Hong Kong. Much of the other DLC is additional content – extra outfits, weapons and vehicles – which you won’t even notice in the main game.If you missed it the first time around, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is well worth picking up. It plays beautifully, has a great story, and will introduce you to a world you never knew you wanted to explore. There’s also no doubting that it’s better than the original release. It has been improved in many ways; the graphics, presentation and gameplay have been tweaked and there is some additional content, even if not a great deal. It’s a superb game, but not one worth upgrading your hardware for. Highly Recommended "

												This game is, quite frankly, amazing. I've only spent a small amount of time with it, but I've completed the story. It's the only game that makes me compare other games to it and feel disatisifed with the other games. STORYThe game's story puts you as Wei, a cop. I found the story quite fun, as it makes you laugh and cheer on some of the characters at certain points (looking at you, grandma!) and some people might not like it due to it's cliche nature. However, don't go thinking about the story too critically; you will be slightly dissapointed. The story makes you feel for the characters, and wanting to go against the characters in the story; which, I believe, is the purpose. It isn't the best story ever, but I love it due to it's nature. Highly subjective!GAMEPLAYAh, the most important part to lots of people. The gameplay is incredibly fun! Lots of high action, slow mo moves to make you really feel like Wei, and not some generic character. The system reminds me of the Arkham series, but I prefer this system by miles. The gunplay is alright, not great, but I love how the pistols feel. I think this matters because it is reminiscent of gang violence, which is what the game is based around. The general style of the combat made me play Sleeping Dog's MMO, which is called Triad Wars, but don't try it. Seriously. Waste. Of. Time.GRAPHICSThe graphics are fine, not too good, not too bad. The only annoyance is the low view distance, which is covered by a Depth-of-Field like fog. I wish you could turn it off. Other than that, the graphics are fine and make you feel immersed.Nice viarety of graphics options, lacking an FoV slider but that isn't too necessary. REPLAYABILITYNow, this is where my hours come into account. Notice the low amount; I believe that it has little to no replayability, and that is why I wanted the MMO to succeed. Sure, if you like collecting things, you'll have a great time completing this one, but if you're like me, and just 'play' games, you won't particularly like this one. OVERALLGreat game, nice graphics, amazing combat, fantastic story, but no replayability. BUT, I won't let this one itch stop me. I love this game, and it's easily one of the best games I've ever played. It's a 10/10. Have fun!			"

It is definitely worth its price. The gameplay will make you feel like a badass from an 80's action film, and the story will keep you engrossed until you finish it. Whether you're leaping from car to car on a freeway or beating up everyone in a fight club, Sleeping Dogs will be a fun experience.			"

												Amazing game.It is a ""would be"" True Crime game. For comparison, other games in this series are very mediocre. Not Sleeping Dogs, though. This one could easily go toe to toe with the big fish like GTA.Also sports the best car in a game I've seen. A crossover of the Knight Rider and a James Bond car.The cons are negligible. The camera spazzes out occasionally, especially when performing Action Hijacks. The GPS can be a load of crap sometimes. In addition, money isn't a problem at all, unless you go for a completionist playthrough and want to buy all the cars and clothes. The main story DLCs are great, but very short (from around 40 minutes to 3 hours to complete). Also, they are significantly less serious in tone compared to the base game, which might be a drawback for some people.That's all the cons I could think of.			"

												Sleeping Dogs: Definitive edition is almost a straight-upgrade to the original, Of which I had on my Xbox 360, Loved it to pieces and then when I heard about this, and in the 2 year time period of the games coming out got a gaming PC, I knew I had to get it on the PC. It has amazing parkour mechanics, With smooth yet realistic mechanics, The slow-motion is possibly the best around and dont get me started on the figthing mechanics... Maghad. The fighting mechanics are possibly the best I have seen in years. GTA's fighting mechanics are... Okay, But compared to Sleeping Dogs', GTA is on its hands and feet. Its a mass of fun to play, WIth vastly updated mechanics and content, And when you buy the game, You get all 24 DLC's included with it. The graphics have been updated, But not that much tbh. Cant get much better than that, Right?Pro's- Amazing parkour mechanics- Brilliant sound effects- updated graphics- Absoloutely brilliant fighting and shooting mechanics- The slow-motion... :DCon's- No modding compatability as of UK: 10/12/14 US: 12/10/14 GDArcan said that there ""won’t be any mod tools"" ;'(- Graphics haven't been vastly upgraded.OVERALL:9/10Would definately recommend.

												Sleeping Dogs grabs the best aspects from many famous franchises and mashes them into a surprisingly cohesive whole.Kung Fu / 10Usual GTA brand of sandbox comes in a very detailed asian island flair to explore, boasting some very interesting cultural references that are unique to this title; Arkham style combat which relies on timing and countering, as well as some combination attacks (which can be upgraded as you find specific collectibles); the usual free running stuff for some parkour tricks (although in a somewhat limited manner); and a very polished gunplay mechanic which includes Max Payne-ish bullet time. Oh, also, completely absurd car physic (this is a plus in my book).The game plays very well and pulling counters, slow-mo headshots, and driving enemies off the road (amongst others) are all incredibly satisfying. Counters and environmental kills can get quite brutal and gory, which is nice and makes the combat feel weighty and significant most of the time.“Character Progression”, if you would call it that, is present through a few different “meters” you level up; leveling up gives you points to spend on certain perks. You can choose your way but you will likely end up with (almost) everything. However, the amount of experience you get for these meters is still not particularly well balanced, a problem the original also had.Integrated DLC is very interesting but some open up at somewhat weird times. “Death by a Thousand Cuts” opens up really soon and can frustrate; “Shaolin Showdown” also seems somewhat random. The “Zodiac Tournament” (which deserves special mention for being a brilliant piece of DLC done right) also opens up too soon, but it's worth going in an taking a peek just to see what's in store for you. It's great. Everything else works really well. I particularly liked the SWAT DLC being broken into several missions that gradually open up as you progress in the story; it definitely helped in keeping the variety up.A few words about the story: I personally really liked it. While far from the most original thing, it was very well written and delivered. Many games try to get the player attached to its characters but, at least personally, they mostly fail. I simply find it very hard to care or to empathize. So I was very surprised to find myself deeply engaged with the characters of this world. Wiston, Peggy, Uncle Po, Ricky, Conroy, Jackie. They all mattered and played their part, but it goes beyond. The character arch of Jackie, how Conroy’s attitude towards you shifts through the whole game. It’s not a moment’s difference, it’s everything that happens. How the game takes the time to make you do menial tasks for Peggy. Everything builds up.Technical Considerations:I’ve bought and played this game at around 2014 December. I had a few minor visual glitches every now and again but nothing even close to game breaking. Even though this version is somewhat infamous for running poorly, it ran pretty well for me. There are also plenty of graphics options to tweak in case you want to sacrifice some bells and whistles for stability. I would recommend trying your best to get World Density (or whatever it’s called - it’s under advanced graphical settings) to the max though; it had a significant difference in the feel of the environment for me.TL;DR:One of my favorite games of the 7th generation. It takes the best parts of many worlds and combines them into a really solid whole. Combat is fun, the story is engaging and the world is alive and interesting to be in. DLC implementation is really well done. Definitely recommended.Miscellaneous Information:Managed to 100% the main game in roughly 43 hours (in-game time), but I had already done it before on the PS3, so I knew my way around.Regarding the extra DLC chapters: I've only done about an hour of the ""Nightmare In North Point"" chapter. It's OK at best. There are some good jokes, but I was not particularly taken by it. The vibrancy of the world is replaced by a really heavy handed blue-filter which makes everything look the same. The new enemies are not particularly interesting to fight. It definitely wasn't my cup of tea, and it honestly sucked a bit of hype for the other chapter (Year of The Snake), which I haven't even played and for all I know could be way better.Moral of the story here is that I get that sometimes people want more, but sometimes leaving that desire unfulfilled is what keeps us coming back. I'm shelving this game for the time being; it just seems like it has given me enough. One day I will feel like playing this again (because it really is a great game overall) and then maybe I'll get those extra chapters done.			"

If you're looking for a more single player oriented GTA open world style game, then I would highly suggest you give this a try. If you play GTA games(GTA V Specifically) for the co-op/online experience, then you may want to save your money for GTA V when it comes out.With that said, I absolutely loved the game and was way better than I have expected. The story will keep you wanting to know what happens next so prepare yourself for that if you do decide to pick this game up.			"

												The moment I walked into the bright and vibrant city streets of Hong Kong, I knew this game would blow my mind. Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition is a unique open-world action videogame with crime as its main topic. In Sleeping Dogs you play as Wei Shen, a american-asian undercover police detective tasked to infilitrate into the Sun On Yee, one of the five triads in the  city. The game's graphics are brilliant for it's age, and I must say the developers have worked hard to polish it up for the definitive edition. The storyline is as great as always, with memorable characters and exceptional dialogue, all laced with brief chinese and cantonese words to make the enviorment feel more like a living, breathing Hong Kong city. The gameplay mechanics mainly focus on combat, and unlike the Arkham series developed by Rocksteady, this game's combat mechanics centers on counter-attacks. With both brilliant and brutal enviormental kills such as slamming a person into a rooftop fanblade and impaling enemies onto bamboo shoots, the combat is both lively, exhilerating and amazing. The storyline is lengthy and is not repetitive, unlike recent videogames such as Mafia 3. The missions are fun, the storyline is brilliant told and filled with fun, comedic jokes along the way. This game is much more than a 'GTA-Clone', it is open-world games taken to a whole new level. Most open-world games take place in the west, this was the first game that changed that. The change in enviorment and the interactivity of the world around you makes this game a memorable, beautiful, unique, awesome and brilliant masterpiece.This was the best open-world game I've played of all time, buying it at the full price is definitely worth it.

												Do you like Hong Kong action flicks from the 90's to early 00's? Do you like Asian metropolis' with its colourful citizens? This game is for you, then.There are two things that seperate this game from the rest of the open world, modern day genres:1. Its Kung Fu combat system.2. Its RPG elements that allow you to improve your character.I enjoyed this game on the Xbox 360 and I purchased it on a whim on Steam when I saw it included all the DLC. I find that every generation of consoles, there is an Asian-style fighting game that takes place in Hong Kong. In 2003, we had Jet Li's Rise to Honour. In 2013, we have Sleeping Dogs. What does 2023 hold for us? Only time will tell.Anyways, get it when it's on sale. The physics and gameplay isn't as realistic or fleshed out as GTA V, but the game itself and the flavour is worth it.			"

												Pros:Challenging and fun kung-fu fighter gameplayVibrant and interesting environmentSurprisingly great storyGreat DLCCons:It has an endingCar gets stuck when you drive it up the down escalatorTips:You can drive faster on the sidewalk if you hold your horn down and floor itInteresting gameplay mechanics that integrate well with the story. You're an undercover cop that is infiltrating a gang and that gang then has you attempting to overthrow another faction within that gang. The game rewards you with experience based on how you play out the fights (did you behave like a police officer? Police exp. get. Did you kill a lot of gang members and cause a lot of collateral? Gang exp get.) and how you behave in the city.Vibrant city with large crowds and great driving mechanics makes the open world experience a blast to play through as well.Overall: 8.5/10 Would kung fu again			"

												If you've already got Sleeping Dogs, I don't know if getting the DE is strictly necessary. But I bought it anyway just to see what the differences were (which seem to be that you get all the DLC integrated and there's some cosmetic improvements).Nevertheless, I ended up playing through the whole thing again. It really is one of the best open world games released in the last while, so if you DON'T have it and you like this sort of thing, umm, why don't you have it yet? To recap, the characterisation is superb, the gameplay is very good - the melee combat is particularly satisfying, as you would want a game with an particular emphasis on the martial arts to be. No doubt there is the usual disjoint between the plot and the open-world stuff in that you play an undercover cop who does a very convincing job of not giving two hoots about the law. The tone varies accordingly so it gets quite dark, with the odd lighter moment, but is never goofy.Also, swordfish.			"

												One of the few open world games I finished.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition is well worth the purchase.The main character, Wei Shen, is an undercover cop who returns to Hong Kong to help infiltrate the Sun On Yee Triad organization. As Wei continues proving himself loyal to the Triads, he gets stuck in war between triad factions while remaining undercover and reporting to his superiors, blurring the lines between him being a cop and being a Triad member.Positives:+ Combat system: Consists of striking, grappling, and counters. These can be chained into combos and other cool moves as you unlock more of Wei's abilities.+ The city: It isn't an exact replica of Hong Kong. But having been there a few times, I can say that the game captures the spirit of Hong Kong beautifully.+ Story: Really intruiging especially as you go deeper into the game.+ Great characters.+ Driving: Probably one the best driving experience i had in open world games+ Tons of clothes.+ The Zodiac tournament: A Really cool homage to Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon.Negatives:- Minor sound bug: On a mission requiring you to shoot a machine gun while on a car, a constant machine gun sound will start and won't stop. This can be fixed multiples ways: by quitting the game and reloading the file, by restarting your PC, Remove the save file and put it back again.- Too much English. Wish the characters spoke more Cantonese since the game is set in Hong Kong.- No matter how much heat you have, the cops stop chasing you once you enter your apartment.Score: 8.5 / 10			"

												One of the best games I've recently played. I played about an hour of the original, so I don't know how well this compares to the other, but man is this game fun.Combat is very fluid and very tight. It feels a little bit like the Arkham games, but in it's own way. You mash left click to punch and depending on a certain way you press it, it does a special move, and you have to press right click to counterattack an enemy. There are guns in this game, but I find that most of the time you won't be needing them, only on missions where the enemies have their own guns. The shooting is pretty much like any other third person shooter, nothing special but it works nicely.Driving is alright in this game. It's not as good as GTA V, but it's passable. I like the ability to jump off your motorcycle and onto another car, it's really cool. I also like that you can press Shift to ram into other vehicles and drive them off road. There's lots of cars in the game too, and you can buy a bunch of them and keep them forever. I'm not sure if you're allowed to put a stolen vehicle into your parking garage.The game takes place in Hong Kong and boy it's beautiful. Driving down the alley way you can see all the wires hanging from the tall apartment building, the roads are littered with bright neon lights, and there are tons of people too. One new improvement from the original is that there are more people on screen at one time and it's actually pretty impressive. Walking down the Night Market at night (lol) is impressive because that's when everyone comes out. There are huge crowds of people, and it's fun to stalk them and listen in on their conversation. It's neat because it's kinda rare to hear the same conversation repeated in a short period of time. There are always new things that the people are talking about.The sounds in this game are pretty decent. Cars sound loud, punching people has a satisfying thump to it, and the voice acting is great. One of the best things about the sound is the original soundtrack. It's like a mixture of classic Chinese music and hip-hop beats, as if Wu-Tang made their beats with an orchestra. I catch myself sitting at the main menu for a few minutes listening to the wonderful music.The graphics are pleasing as well. You won't find graphics as good as Arma 3 or Battlefield 4 here, but it's better than most other recent games (looking at you, SR4). There are a good ammount of graphics options available. Also, there is another HD texture pack that you can install onto the game.Included with the Definitive Edition is all the past DLC from the original game. There are two expanision packs included, and to my knowledge they are pretty long themselves. The other DLC is mostly cars, clothing, weapons, that sort of thing. What it all comes down to really is if it's fun or not, and it most definitely is. The combat is fun, takes skill and is very satisfying, the driving is neat, and the story is good enough to get you hooked on thinking whats gonna happen next. Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition gets a 8/10. "

												This game has it all. A very well designed Hong Kong which, in combination with the action packed story, truly feels alive, especially in the Definitive Edition.The AI is pretty good, sometimes making you sweat over things that seem miniscule, which is good, makes you struggle to get those pesky achievements and so it becomes more rewarding in the end ;)But the best part of this game, at least for me, is its music.

												I bought this game while it was on sale, and when I first started playing it, I disliked the graphics and gameplay. The fighting was confusing, and I was comparing it to GTA5. However, I made a huge HUGE mistake.This quickly became one of my favourite games.Lets get the cons over with: The lighting and environment is slightly dull, and there are some weird vehicle glitchesPROS:The fighting style is amazing, easy to learn and cool af once you master it. It has a proper learning curve, and increases in challenge. There is no ultimate kill-mode you attain at the end, you simply climb the learning curve sucessfullyThe car races are fun with a capital F. You are allowed to bash, crash and slam the other opponents. The vehicle controls are easy to master and the variety of cars are fun. The hijack system is fun to screw around with as well!The storyline, although it didn't impress me significantly, it was short and sweet, and it was fun achieving the 'police' and 'triad' xp, as well as leveling up and achieving milestones (disarms, headshots, etc)All in all, I went and got a 100% clear on the game, dlcs and all. I would recommend picking this up for a cool jackie chan/bruce lee version of gta.			"

												Wei's story will resonate with anyone who grew up in two cultures or is Asian-American. You will go through what pulls him in two directions as he struggles to find his place culturally. If HBO, did a miniseries about a cop infiltrating the mafia in Asia, it would be Sleeping dogs.Compared to GTA:- Better fighting. Like infinitely better- Better environment/immersion. Looks like Asia/HK even down to stuff like the air conditioner and bongo trucks.- Better RPG. You can customize your abilities towards cop / triad.- Better car management. You can get a car from any parking garage.- Better side missions. There's racing like GTA, but also fight club. Also, your side missions not only give you money but also mafia XP or police XP.- Worse driving, but only slightly- Gunplay is different. You throw away a gun after running out of ammo. You cannot store your gun (only if you have DLC that includes guns with your outfits). But gunplay isn't important to the story since it's fighting based. "

												So in this game you play as an immoral wank*r (Triad Member) who is actually a professional wank*r (Police Officer) in a city once ruled by imperial wank*rs (Hong Kong). Yup... and you can be sure that my psycho-side was in full force when I played this. I just couldn't help myself. XDIt's basically a sandbox crime game, but with the added twist of you sometimes doing sandbox stuff where you punch crime instead. Or taze it. Or shoot it. Or arrest it. Or... yeah not continuing this. Anyway, there's lots of side missions, collectibles, places to explore, minigames, and citizens to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of when they make rude remarks about your clothes, hit you with their car, or just simply exist. Honestly, I didn't need reasons to act like a total sociopath (even moreso than I do in the Saints Row games, which is really saying something), so I had a tendency to act like one......except during alot of missions when it actually has negative effects. Basically you have three leveling systems: Police (which you get xp for by obeying the law and punching criminals on police missions), Triad (for punching people or slamming their head into... woah that was uncalled for), and Face (for helping people, which I find funny since pride pretty much never involves being a benefactor). It's pretty obvious which of these three leveling systems I didn't get much XP for. The minigames were kinda silly, particularly that karaoke stuff and the whole collecting girl phone numbers thing (which I never called because I never got that bored). At least the combat is pretty good.There is a story, and it's actually pretty good. At times predictable, and I often felt as if my main character was being way too antagonistic towards his police handler. But it's good. Also its crazy-violent, because gangsters who talk about codes and honor are the last people to actually respect such things. And while I was not torn at all about whose side I was on (because Triad people are scum), I did cheer a few times when they did stuff I wanted them to do, such as when the character I hated the most (because he pulled a Walder Frey, which made me think about the ""RW"" and all that comes with that) ended up being killed by a crazed lady feeding him one of his henchmen and chopping him with a meat cleaver. And while that was certainly satisfying, it wasn't one of the many ideas I had between the ""Hong Kong RW"" and that scene about what way I would have ended that guy (or Walder Frey). I had an alarming tendency to ponder what outrageous act of violence I wanted to see end the lives of certain characters, most of which were more brutal than what actually happened. I really must be a psycho. >_<Anyway... sandbox crime, violence, betrayal... all that horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ There isn't really anything new here, and while I certainly prefer other games (like the Saints Row series) for this type of fun, this is alright. So I guess that's a ""yes"" from me.Yey.			"

												Cool game, lovely voice work and great graphics. The environments are nice and the combat is fun. However there is one thing that I cannot shake when I play this and it is very irritating. It feels like a poor man's GTA. Driving vehicles is no fun either, mostly because when using a mouse and keyboard, the camera is awkward. Reversing on a bike will spin the camera, but if you manually move the mouse to get a better look as you set off forward, it will still rotate the camera and as such go beyond the forward view - as if it has to complete the entire motion. Why they couldn't of made it so moving the camera view yourself resets the camera spin, I just don't know.There are are a few other minor annoyances. Sometimes AI will walk into things, which isn't that bad really and many games are guilty of that (ahem Payday 2), but one of my biggest gripes when playing on foot is that there is no toggle for walk and run. Instead, if you want to walk you must rely on holding the free aim button (which is right click by default). However using free aim to walk is evidently not the proper way of doing it because whenever you get near an interactable object that you wish to talk past, your guy will just... sort of strafe past it while trying to get it in focus. Bit daft really that they couldn't simply add a walk toggle button.Another annoyance? The weird buttons. The game plays brilliantly with mouse and keyboard, but I have no idea why some menus rely solely on pressing Left-CTRL and Right-CTRL and Backspace and Enter. Why couldn't a cursor be implemented? Seems a bit lazy if you ask me.Overall, of what I've played (among some other very minor bugs which I've decided not to mention here), the game is excellent and well worth the money if you haven't already got the base game. For those who have the original Sleeping Dogs, I wouldn't necessarily say the increase in graphical fidelity and draw distance was worth it... although that is ultimately your decision. "

												United Front Games, at first I found it strange that the cutcenes were dropping fps but it was having no impact on the game, then I started driving and being able to freely travel the map. I am looking at a loss of up to 30 fps doing these, even when it's just like walking through a park or something simple. The game has crashed twice during missions when the objectives change. As of right now, the mission where you take the city van to the racing guy and bug his vehice will permanently lock my game. I have not been able to find a fix. Could you please patch this?Edit: I have decided to lock the framerate to 30. I know it has to be my graphics card causing some of the fps dropping. I was able to circumvent the repeating lockup on that mission by entering the city van from the driver side door instead of the passenger side. I still experience random crashes but not enough to upset me. I've decided to return my review to recommended as I feel that it's a great title and worth playing even with it's faults.			"

												I really like Sleeping Dogs! It is of course like GTA but with a really cool story and style. The fighting is very fun and rewarding. Driving is a little difficult for me so far but I may get the hang of it yet. The cars dont handle like GTA. The graphics are pretty demanding but very pretty. Great game.			"

												havign only played the demo on the xbox 360 for the first one, i was impressed but that was a few years ago. i decided to pick up this game and i originally thougth it was liek a gangster gaem but there is much too it. You are an undercover cop and its really good as you get multiple side missions. You get all teh dlc which if you never played the original, you dont know what you get extra, its like an all in one. This is really fun to play and also based in china instead of those american street gang games which get boring. The graphic is able to run it on ultra is amazing but even at medium it looks nice. (my gpu = nvidia gtx760 cpu: i7 4470k)Overall i rate this game a 10/10I havnt even completed the game either!!!			"

												Best Singleplayer Game I have played in quite a long time.If you cant afford GTA, or your parents won't let you buy it, get this game. It's awesome.I like the icon-ism of everything in the game.When you look around, you know you are in Asia, not some knock-off Chinatown.One thing I really enjoyed, along with the Chinatown realism, was the hand-to-hand combat system.And, last but for sure not least, the graphics.Just.Amazing.One recommendation, would be to turn V-Sync off. It slows the game right down, but disabling it by going into Graphics>(Press Q), you get maybe a 100+ FPS boost.Other than that, the game is awesome. Character Development is through the roof. Choosing your own path is an awesome feature that I often use so I can get on the cops good side, and then I turn my back and go do some shady dealing right down the block.------------------------------------Overall = 10/10.My favorite game this year, by far.

Pros+ Slick gameplay+ Great Story+ Characters+ Voice acting is really well done.+ AI is top notch+ Great Setting (Hong Kong) Cons- Some settings are poorly Optimized. Had to gimp SEVERAL settings using an I5-4690k and GTX 970 just to get a more steady 60fps and I still had some frame drops in certain areas. You can turn down ""Enable Quality Anti-Aliasing"" down from Extreme to High and it will shoot up like 100fps but it makes the game look pretty awful in my opinion. So I just toned down all the shadow settings to normal and such.- Most of the DLC is either pointless or just bad. - Cop missions are REALLY boring. Luckily after a couple of them they're optional.Overall this game was worth every penny. Grabbed it on sale for 7.50, went into it blindly, and it exceeded my expectations by a long shot. I recommend this to anyone who likes GTA styled open world games, a great story, or someone just wanting a great Action-Adventure game with fantastic gameplay. Final Score - ★★★★☆			"

												If you want a review of this game, then you would do well to look at the original Sleeping Dogs' reviews.  This is the same game with slightly updated graphics and all of the DLC included.  Is it worth it?  That depends on you.The graphics are indeed improved from the original, but really, it isn't much of a difference.  Sleeping Dogs on max settings was already a very good looking game.  Definitive Edition improves the graphics slightly, but certainly not enough to justify a re-purchase, or even a significantly higher price than you might spend on the original game.  If Definitive Edition goes to the same price as Sleeping Dogs + the three story DLCs, then I would probably recommend this version.However, this version isn't just improvements.  The control scheme on Mouse/Keyboard was changed somewhat from the original game, and I would argue that it is for the worse.  Many of the button placements are more difficult to press than the keys in the original.  Some of these can be rebound easily, so this might not be that big of a deal.  Another thing to note is that the problems with the keyboard controls from the original game are still there.  There are still many things that are controlled using the arrow keys, the enter key, and backspace.The gamepad controls are unchanged as far as I can tell, so if you have a gamepad, such as an XBOX 360 controller, I would recommend using that.  If you don't have a gamepad, then I'm not sure that I would recommend Definitive Edition due to the akward control scheme.			"

												Excellent game with a good story line, nice graphics, enough collectables and side quests to keep you going for a while. Nice fighting mechanics (although some of the moves can seem a little hard to pull off when surrounded by 20 bad guys). Throwing a bad guy onto a pallet of swordfish heads, pork buns, massage parlours (of both types ;-)) doggy DVD sellers, learn swearing in another language, nice mix of music to choose in cars, hot girls.The not so good aspects, after a while the melee loses its appeal and I resorted to cheap run them over with a car just to avoid a long drawn out fist fight. Pork buns (not a whole man), doggy DVD sellers, and hot girls you can’t get down a dirty with.Overall, a brilliant game with loads of movie clichés and fun action with a nice decent feel, it’s as if your almost in Hong Kong trying to bring down an underworld organisation as an undercover cop, well worth price especially on sale. I give it thumbs up! "

												I would recommend this, if you've been trying to find something that's GTA-ish, or if you're looking for something that's like ""Stranglehold"". In some ways, this game reminds me of what you do in GTA, but the premise of being an undercover cop, in Hong Kong.If you're somewhat influenced by the late 90s' Hong Kong ""gangster"" movies, e.g ""Young & Dangerous"", or some of John Woo's movies like ""Hard Boiled"" (the one with Chow Yun Fatt), you'll see the similarities quickly.In fact, I look at this game very similarly to ""Stranglehold"" (which is derived from the movie ""Hard Boiled"") and you'll probably look at this game the same way I did, just more tuned borrowing concepts from GTA, except Stranglehold was a FPS, and GTA doesn't have anything to do with Hong Kong, yet.

												It's like Batman Arkham Asylum meets Grand Theft Auto and Parkour skills of Assassin's Creed. It's gucci game, and it's often on sale, so please do get it. It runs well on low-end laptops also, so it's a game you could pick up even without a PC. It's different from GTA in that here you play as an undercover cop that inflitrates triads. The game feels immersive enough for you to care not to be so rowdy, it does seep into you and sometimes I find myself driving calmly because I'm a nice cop and I don't want to get innocent people killed.Oh yeah, you also could sing karaoke and go on cockfights and do martial arts. Really cool game.			"

												This review is for those who played the original version but are curious about whether the ""Definitive Edition"" is worth it, and what's different.Overall, the Definitive Edition is still the same as the original game, but there are some noticeable differences that alter your experience somewhat.  First, the graphics are, indeed, much improved in terms of the overall atmosphere.  You can drop them down to the same level they were at in the original version, or pump them up to the max, and see a much prettier, more colorful city (obviously, at the cost of some framerate loss, depending on your machine).  I have a 2010 era machine, so it strains a bit with the newer graphics, but it's still manageable.  If you have a more modern rig, you should run it fine.Gameplay-wise, the interface itself is identical.  Combat is the same, driving is the same.  The storyline plays out the same.  The major difference in gameplay is in the availability of side missions and other bonuses.  In the original game, if you bought all the DLC, there were certain side missions that you could farm endlessly to rank up and unlock abilities.  Likewise, there were ""red envelopes"" left around town at various parking garages, right out front.  You'd just run up, grab it, and suddenly have an extra $50K-100K to spend.  Both aspects have been changed.  The red envelopes still exist, but they're hidden away in places that can be a challenge to reach.  You have to do some puzzle solving to get to some of them, and they're far, far less obvious.  Of course, you can still make money through things like truck hijacking (once you unlock it), but that raises the second big change.Most of the side missions now unlock at different points in the game, after certain story events have happened.  This means that the actual progression through the game is a bit more challenging, and a bit more reasonably paced.   If memory serves, the original game allowed you to play the Martial Arts competitions only after you moved to the new neighborhood.  Now that's applied to basically all of the side missions.  So, the old Triad Highway mission isn't a repeatable thing that you can farm for Triad points.  It's a side mission that shows up occasionally at different points in the story.  In my opinion, that's neither better nor worse than before.  It's just different.  The game is still fun to play without being over-leveled.  On the other hand, you may prefer the freedom to upgrade with ease and buy whatever you want whenever (once you collect your red envelopes).  If that's the case, then you may prefer the original game and not care as much about the enhanced graphics.			"

Although combat move commands are quite complex to perform and remember, pretty nice gameplay. Though, what I dislike about it is that if I exit the game in the middle of a mission (that is already a checkpoint) and then return, I will appear in my safehouse instead of the place where my last progress is & the mission will restart and all the progress in between is lost.

												Absolutely one of the most under-appreciated games ever made, hands down probably my favorite open-world game. I'd say it's a Chinese-American version of Yakuza, but less people know about that than this probably.Pros:-Combat: The hand-to-hand combat is fantastic, it's a slightly more complex ""Arkham style"", with counters, grabs, and actual button combos, which lead to visceral fist fights, ending in the always enjoyable slow-motion knockout/kill. This is probably what sells the game for me, it's just so much fun getting in huge fights that range from fists, to melee weapons, to all-out gun fights.-Story: Playing an undercover cop in a Triad gang is a great start, as we watch the main character grapple with needing to enforce the law, but also being in a gang that he comes to respect/love. Spoilers aside, it's pretty great. The voice-acting is fantastic as well, with enough actual Mandarin that it doesn't feel like Disney Presents: Sleeping Dogs.-Driving: Some people aren't a huge fan of the car physics in the game, which I can respect, but I love it. It feels rather Arcade-y, with hairpin handbrake turning, and the ability to jump from your car to others, it's just a blast to drive around causing havoc. It's true, sometimes I felt cheated by getting caught on something only to spin out and get stuck, but that's a rare occurrence.-Customization: There are tons of outfits for your character, which actually changes how you play, with some getting bonus XP, and others giving you increased gun accuracy or melee strength. You can't change his hair or anything like that, but watching him enter a scene dressed like a '90s rocker is always fun.-Length: There is plenty to do, my first playthrough on the PS3 got me about 20-25 hours of messing around and plot, and now this version has even more added content, with new missions and side-activities, it's definitely not a game to speedrun.Cons:-Guns: I did say I enjoy the gun fights, but it's hardly a terrible thing they're not too frequent. You never feel very accurate when shooting, and will most likely miss more than you hit, especially in the driving sections that ask you to protect the car. They're far from game-breaking, but you can really tell they focused on the fisticuffs and threw in guns afterwards.-Level Up System: One of the cruxes of the game, is how you level up. There are 2 level up paths; Triad and Cop. Each mission will award XP to both in a ""star-sytem"", that is, maximum XP is 3 stars, and minimum is no stars. When you start a mission, cop XP starts at 3 full stars, but when you mess up you lose from that potential reward pool, by either hurting innocents, or driving like a maniac. Triad XP is earned  by fighting and general killing, and builds from 0 stars. What you have to do is try and be as bad aas possible, while still being good. Interesting on paper, but in reality it's rather annoying. It is so much easier to get cop XP that you may be fully leveled on Cop, and on level 5 of Triad. While also not game-breaking, it just feels unbalanced.World Size: It says it's open-world, but in reality it's about 3 or 4 small cities attached by roads, circling a large empty area. It looks far larger than it really is, and seems rather deceiving.Other than that I can't think of anything right now, it's a hell of a game, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a new twist on an old genre. It's fun to play, easy to get into, and will swallow your time if you give it the chance.			"

You can drop them down to the same level they were at in the original version, or pump them up to the max, and see a much prettier, more colorful city (obviously, at the cost of some framerate loss, depending on your machine).  I have a 2010 era machine, so it strains a bit with the newer graphics, but it's still manageable.  If you have a more modern rig, you should run it fine.Gameplay-wise, the interface itself is identical.  Combat is the same, driving is the same.  The storyline plays out the same.  The major difference in gameplay is in the availability of side missions and other bonuses.  In the original game, if you bought all the DLC, there were certain side missions that you could farm endlessly to rank up and unlock abilities.  Likewise, there were ""red envelopes"" left around town at various parking garages, right out front.  You'd just run up, grab it, and suddenly have an extra $50K-100K to spend.  Both aspects have been changed.  The red envelopes still exist, but they're hidden away in places that can be a challenge to reach.  You have to do some puzzle solving to get to some of them, and they're far, far less obvious.  Of course, you can still make money through things like truck hijacking (once you unlock it), but that raises the second big change.Most of the side missions now unlock at different points in the game, after certain story events have happened.  This means that the actual progression through the game is a bit more challenging, and a bit more reasonably paced.   If memory serves, the original game allowed you to play the Martial Arts competitions only after you moved to the new neighborhood.  Now that's applied to basically all of the side missions.  So, the old Triad Highway mission isn't a repeatable thing that you can farm for Triad points.  It's a side mission that shows up occasionally at different points in the story.  In my opinion, that's neither better nor worse than before.  It's just different.  The game is still fun to play without being over-leveled.  On the other hand, you may prefer the freedom to upgrade with ease and buy whatever you want whenever (once you collect your red envelopes).  If that's the case, then you may prefer the original game and not care as much about the enhanced graphics.			"

												Sleeping Dogs is a solid, but sorta clunky, game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes action/open world games.    First off, I would recommend playing with a controller for this game. The keyboard controls aren't TERRIBLE, but you will be finding yourself fustrated in some fighting/driving sections in the game. Nevertheless, Sleeping Dogs has a fun combat system, similar to the Batman Arkham games. It is smooth and you will be finding yourself just going around Hong Kong beating up baddies.    Hong Kong is spectacular to look at (especially at night). Overall, it is a good looking game. Character models look good and all characters in the game are well voice acted. The characters in Sleeping Dogs are detailed and Wei Shen is a likeable main character along with the other supporting characters in the game.     Hong Kong feels alive, wherever you go it will feel like you are in an actual city that you will be able to explore. Sleeping Dogs also has quite a few side activities including: races, fight clubs, karaoke (yes, karaoke), side challenges, betting on chicken fights and more.      There are quite a few things to collect around Hong Kong. There is actual importance in these collectibles, like to learn to fighting moves or increase your maximum health.     Sleeping Dogs has some issues that shine a little too many times throughout this game. The game is sometimes too easy. In shooter sections, it is just too easy, the AI just isn't smart enough to make you get a game over screen in these sections. And although there is quite a bit of side mission in this game, they kinda get repettitive. Some quests often have you do very similar activities here and there. And this game can be fustratingly buggy. Just be prepared when the game just decides to do a total U-turn on you in some sections like action hijacking a big vehicle for example.      With all of that said, Sleeping Dogs is a decently solid game. I was actually amazed by how much fun I was having when I first played this game. But I recommend Sleeping Dogs to anyone that is looking for an action/ open world game.			"

												If you're a fan of the Grand Theft Auto games you'll like this although it places a huge emphasis on martial arts melee combat with a minimal amount of gunplay so take that into account.I loved the story, who doesn't enjoy an undercover cop trying to infiltrate the chinese Triad who starts to get attached to the people he's supposed to investigate while trying to do his duty. Wei Shen's inner conflict and moral decisions are clearly depicted throughout the game and the story could easily stand tall with any AAA Hollywood movie of the same genre, in large part due to its excellent voice acting.The gameplay itself is well done and enjoyable, with excellent kung fu moves to unlock as well as other character bonuses that you open up through a smart upgrade system that intergrates itself beautifully into the game. A bevy of diverse and entertaining side missions further complement the game, enabling you to stretch your gametime into dozens of hours if you're so inclined, especially if you take into account the multitude of collectibles that reward you with cool & interesting outfits, health upgrades and vehicles - I'm always more motivated to get all collectibles if they actually give you something in return, so it's nice to see that here.I also did not encounter a single bug throughout my 40+ hours of playtime, which is awesome.On a seperate note I'd skip the DLCs if you can, especially ""Year of the Snake"" as I found it to be so boring that I didn't manage to finish it. ""Nightmare in North Point"" however is a lot more fun, more so if you're into vampires (like I am) as we get to go up against Jiang Shi, China's version of vampires. One thing that kind of drove me crazy in the DLCs however is that you don't have full access to the martial arts moves from the campaign whether by design or possible bugs that never got fixed. Regardless of the reason I found this to be frustrating when coupled with the fact that the mini-map doesn't display selected driving routes as it does in the campaign so you're forced to consult the full-screen map quite often. This isn't as apparent in ""Nightmare in North Point"" as it is in ""Year of the Snake"" however.8.75/10			"

												If you enjoy Hong Kong action films, you'll love this game!Let me preface this by saying that I'm usually not a big fan of GTA-style games.  What usually happens is that I spend the first hour trying to adapt to the funky console-ported controls and views, then get sidetracked on several repetitive missions, before finally getting stuck on an crucial plot-related mission and quitting in frustration.  But this game is just GOOD!  First, the Sleeping Dogs world is immersive and believable.  You are constantly reminded that the story takes place in Hong Kong, beginning with the left-hand driving, to the street signs, language immersion (Cantonese), and the cultural cues (like Asian Pop).   The music is great and the action is fun.  Unlike the US, guns are illegal in Hong Kong and gun-violence is rare.  Most, but not all, of the action involves martial arts (generally button combos) and vehicle chases.Give this game a try!			"

												This game was the most enjoyable experience I have ever had while playing a game. Everything about this game was SO prefect that I played it 2 days straight just to complete the story. I recommend this game to anyone who wants an intelligent and exciting game. There are no cons to this game as far as I'm concerned, expect that at some point, it must end. Pros:- Fun combat system- Not too over the top- Better than GTA (imo)- Characters are very likeable and relatable- Story is amazing- The setting is so immersive and realistic- You play as the most badass guy ever, but that's not his entire character- The cars are very easy to control and none are a bore to drive (unlike GTA)- Hommage to Martial Arts movies, like John Woo movies- My Favourite Game of All Time			"

												Sleeping Dogs : Def Edt, is an amazing game. Although like all games it's not without problems!PROS:*The Graphics are stunning, and the game itself is relatively easy to run.*Combat makes you feel awesome, alot like Assassins Creed did. (Close quarters fighting)*Great, and intense environment kills to be found everywhere. I mean when have you not wanted to throw someone on a platform of swordfish?*The Characters are definitley engaging, and leaves you connected. And when the inevitable happens and a character departs, the player truly feels like they've lost someone.*I love how quickly when fighting a different class of enemy you are not used to your felling of 'control' can quickly fade, and you have to try several things before it will work.*The lighting feels great, it was something I frequently noticed and just had to be said!CONS:*Very violent, the GTAV torture scene was bad right? Well there is plenty of disturbing scenes in this game too, this could be considered a Pro to some of you bloodthirsty maniacs out there, but ill leave it here for now.*Controls can feel clunky, I used a controller because it was just easier to do in combat situations, although it's not entirely impossible to play with a keyboard*Mission also feel way too linear sometimes*No Multiplayer! Of course GTAV's multiplayer was an insane project and to do the same with Sleeping Dogs would be nuts. However sometimes I do wish that it was multiplayer...*There is lots of content, however the story feels kinda short imo.*Weapon system can feel clunky*The DLC's are definitley lack luster, the main game is the star, the DLC are kind of tedious in some respects.Overall it is an incredible game and needs more recognition, think of it as a smaller GTAV in a Hong Kong setting. I'd give it 8/10			"

												Quick summary. The original Sleeping Dogs is a great game, well worth playing, I enjoyed the gameplay, the story and the soundtrack immensely. If you already own Sleeping Dogs, the Definitive Edition is probably only worth getting if you don't already own all the DLCs. I also encountered several problems with this game, at least one of which was present in the original game.Keyboard/mouse controls are plagued by the same old beeping issue. Spamming buttons during combat or otherwise can cause several seconds of input lag and an annoying beeping sound. I have never encountered this in any other game. This makes the game unplayable with mouse/keyboard. I played through the Definitive Edition with a controller, which worked flawlessly.Playing with a controller did not deactivate the screensaver, This resulted in the screen going black every 15 or so minutes, requiring mouse/keyboard input to wake it up.I maxed Police XP about 60-70% in the game, because nearly every event gives Police XP. I never managed to max out Triad XP, even after completing the game and completing every event. This meant that I couldn't unlock and use the last Triad melee ability during or after the game. "

												 I've been on and off about buying this game. It's always drawn my attention, but then I'd watch the gameplay on YouTube, and I'd decide against buying it because it struck me as all fighting, and the occasional open world exploration. I was wrong. Yes, there's a ton of hand to hand fighting, but there's so much more than that. There's a lot of collectibles, tons of randomly generated people you can help out (that isnt't repetitive either). There's also a lot of different rewards systems too, such as the ""clean driving streak"" (not driving like a hopped up meth head in a police chase on his third strike). The game mechanics are good. The hand to hand combat takes some getting used to, but over all, the controls are smooth. I only have about three hours of game play so far, so all I'm able to comment on are my first impressions (which is the most important part in my opinion). The story is good, the graphics are really good AND well optimized. I,m about three hours into the game, and I,m impressed. If a game hasn't ""hooked"" me by three hours, it's probably not going to. I consider this a good buy.  In case anyone is wondering, I am playing this at maxed out settings using an MSI GTX 970 4GB (in regular gaming mode) and it's not even breaking a sweat. I've experienced absolutely no screen tearing and no texture popping. It stays at an even 60 FPS (my monitor is older hha' so it's on a 60 Hz). I'm using an Intell i7 950 3.1 GHz processor, and an ols gigabyte Z87 mother board. My system is pretty old save for the graphics card, and it's playing the game just fine, Just to show you how powerful the MSI GTX 970 is, all my hardware (minus my GPU) is about 7-8 years old. In the factory OC mode (using the Gaming App, I'm playing Far Cry 4 at max settings with smooth 60 FPS (I am not using the MFAA though, only SMAA).  So, if you're like me and you have relatively old, but powerful hardware, Sleeping Dogs should run very well as long as you have a good graphics card. Feel free to ask me any questions if you have any.			"

												Why settle for simply shooting your enemies, when you can break every bone in their bodies and turn them into a bloody pulp.The battle mechanics is too much fun. The freeform fighting and environment based kills remind me of the Yakuza series while retaining its' own unique flavor. The driving mechanics, while not striving for realism, provides its' own brand of fun with the easy drifting and the sideswipe takedowns.While the amount of side activities aren't as varied as GTA (No tennis or darts, for example), the amount of available side activities is fun on its' own. When was the last time you visited a cockfighting ring, bet 100000 HK$ on a chicken named Sun Tzu, and lose it in 2 minutes?This game might not be your cup of tea if you only enjoy causing havoc and rampage and accrue wanted levels as in GTA, but if you do enjoy using the open world as a facet for the engaging narrative, then this game's for you. Bonus points for being able to replay the story missions after getting enough Face levels to wear that yellow Game of Death Bruce Lee jumpsuit xD10/10 Don't be a pok gai, get this game. You're missing Wei too much by not playing this.""A man who never eats pork buns is never whole!""			"

												Sleeping Dogs, I must say, is one of the best story-driven sandbox RPG game I have played so far. In addition, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition brought the game to its near maximum potential due to its graphics update and the whole environment that have been added into the game. Certain physics and other stuff have been implemented as well to add realness and finesse as you play trough it:- Hair, clothes, and boob physics (cause, why not) :3- More people = more carnage- More vibrant atmosphere in various places- 1080p goodnessAnnoying/recurring bugs:- Sudden sfx loss (when riding a boat or using a certain type of vehicle)- Counter mechanics is still a bit clunky (in my opinion) but alot more responsive than it used to.- Certain glitch occurence (i.e Zodiac Tournament).There might not be alot of changes, but it is certain that Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition have captured the Hong Kong experience once more.

												Chinese GTA/Saint's Row is best GTA/Saint's Row.I started this game without expecting anything, was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it. Lots of things to do when you're not kicking someone's♥♥♥♥♥or shooting holes into them. Story is pretty good, controls are good. I even got so used to driving on the ""incorrect"" side of the road pretty fast, that's something for someone who hates driving around in games.Lastly, karaoke has Air Supply's ""I'm All Out Of Love"" in it! Can't get more authentic than that. 11/10			"

												Great Game with a great story line!My opinions regarding the game:You have to remember that you are in Hong Kong and they do drive on the left. Especially when you are not used to have cars go on the left but on the right in real life. How many times have I crossed the road to be plowed from behind? A mystery because I lost count after 100+.I understand there are so many insurance frauds in the real world, but driving on the road and the car in front slams the brakes a great majority of the time for no reason gets frustrating.The driving game camera could be better controlled especially when you need to reverse fast and move forward. The camera view becomes a real pain when it whips around when you get stuck with the car.Should have a setting to select the radio station you wished to be default for your game or another option is to be able to add your own music folder as a radio station like GTA would be awesome.A fast way to make a lot of money in the game, is to use ""Tran"" car mini-quests from the cellphone. Can make a great deal of money in a short time, of course depended on the cars you obtain until completed all the requests. A few other odd little annoyances like in all other games and that is it, it’s just a game but great game.A trick for achieving the Social Hub “Gambler”:If you go into “Statistics”, then “Completion”, it will show you the “Overall net gambling performance”. The stat tracker in the Social Hub will only take into account the highest of your overall performance has ever been and not what it is currently. The one in Social Hub will never go lower if you go on a losing streak, so you have to look into the “Statistics”, then “Completion”, will show you the “Overall net gambling performance” to find out.This is why it isn't increasing in the Social Hub section. In “Statistics”, I was at -$24 500 for my Overall net performance, even though in Social Hub was stating that I had maximum of $215 000.Follow the tips found online on so many sites in regards of achieving this by saving the game on wins and reload when you lose. Took about 30 minutes to accomplish this by reloading when was at North Point, walk until can grab a taxi to the vehicle store at the dock in Kennedy; steal the car behind when out of the taxi to drive the remaining section to the Kennedy ^Rooster fight. Still a great game to play and challenging to try to obtain all the achievements!P.S. the *Rooster was supposed to be written KCOC <- written backwards, but it gets censored!			"

												I really enjoyed SD:DF. Take the mechanics that made the GTA games fun and combine it with an edgy and interesting storyline set in modern day Hong Kong. Wei Shen is a Chinese-American returning home after many years with a chip on his shoulder regarding the corrupt and powerful triad that messed with his family long ago. The Sun On Yee, the game begins as Wei, now an officer of the law infiltrates the Sun On Yee through an old friend Jackie and the story just continues to build from there.You are given the ability to roam free in the large city of Hong Kong with side quests litered everywhere. From progresing the Police quest line, to the (main) Triad story there are quests to increase your face (reputation), unlock new cars through street races, street brawls, and many variets there of. To add additional flavour you can unlock additional skills and attributes depending on how many side quests you have done which can turn you into a martial arts, asskicking, gun welding unstopable machine.Highly recommend, I played it in small-chunks after work and it kept me thoroughly entertained.

My 780ti is cranking out over 100fps with the graphics set to extreme. I would recommend this game to everyone, the side missions are fun , the in game fighting and driving mechanics are good and who doesn't like doing a running jump kick on someone. oh and the soundtrack is perfect.i give this game a 11/10 on the polock rating scale			"

												How can you ♥♥♥♥ up the camera THIS badly.

THE ONLY VEHICLE WHERE THE CAMERA TURNS AROUND WHEN U REVERSE IS THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOATS. YOU GOTTA BE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME.Gets boring and repetative 15 minutes into a session.Random events you'll drive by will make you randomly fail because you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ if a drunk is harassing a store, the game dares to take you out of your vehicle and basically restart you on the street for no reason and restarts your navigational point because you dont want to do the event. PLS.Even if you have a holstered pistol the game will randomly remove it completely if you get restarted forcing you to do boring 5 click combat because theres really only one effective fighting move and countering.Any mission or favor you do seems glitched half the time, almost half of the missions I do i need to restart because something's glitched. First 10 hours was fine, now it feels even more than half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥than before, quarter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Cops spawn right infront of you not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥you can see them or behind you after you just escaped them.Even with all these faults, I still like the game, but I cant look past them when I have to fight the camera every few seconds, theres no way to disable it, and no mods either.If the game mechanics seem to be built to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, how can I recommend being annoyed?

Sleeping DogsThis one is good. You are an undercover HKPD agent who is tasked with infiltrating the ranks of the Triad Gangs, in order to exact some justice. Along the way, you make choices; you face tough decisions and you become immersed in a alternate reality form of Hong Kong. The city is riddled with violent gangs (unlike the real Hong Kong) and as a HKPD officer, you have to weigh in decisions of going dirty or doing it by the law. The graphics are more PC-worthy, with my only complaint being, that the SSAO is actually not that appealing. What makes this different from GTA and GTA clones, is that it emphasizes the use of martial arts in combat, instead of melee weapons and guns. You do have access to melee weapons and guns, but they are not the do-all be-all of the game. I do praise the adoption of native cantonese language which bears similarity to what you hear in Hong Kong; there are of course, optional english subtitles for those who need them. There is some touches of humor, but the story and dialogue is more on a serious level. There are minigames such as karaoke (reminds me of a form of guitar hero or audiosurf), you can do police missions or triad missions, you can buy cheap and really nice cars and keep them in a garage; you can call a valet or taxi driver. Also, thanks to the definitive edition: You can max out the crowd density, which depicts a more accurate Hong Kong instead of the older console version which was optimized for old consoles. You will pick up the fact that the map of Hong Kong in this game isn't a 100% accurate match of the real Hong Kong, the roads are different and the island is the primary location. There are some places which bear resemblance to Hong Kong, (like victoria peak); but other than that the designers did some embellishing to fit the story, which is fine in my opinion.All in all, I recommend this game for those who like open-city martial arts GTA style games. The story is good and the gameplay is entertaining, with a certain amount of replay value. Now, instead of giving pros and cons; I will give the recipe to pork buns. Why?

												It's hard not to draw comparison to the more popular Grand Theft Auto, but it still exceeds at being it's own thing.Sleeping Dogs takes place in Hong Kong and the map is about as big as GTA IV.You can traverse the map how you like: By Car, Bike, Foot, Boat.The biggest difference from GTA is that this is a more brawler-melee oriented game. You learn and practice martial arts to take down your enemies - you find melee weapons and firearms in certain locations.You play as an undercover cop who has a job to infiltrate the Triads and take them down from the inside.I don't know if you're aware of gangster life, but this♥♥♥♥♥♥is gritty and intense. Definitely one of the most immersive storylines of 2012.You have three reputations to choose to uphold: Cop, Triad and Face.You earn Cop by doing Cop missions, Triad by Triad missions, and Face by doing favors on the street.There is plenty to do so you will never be bored: Drag Races, Underground Fight Clubs, Murder Mysteries to solve - the game engine does an A+ job at making Hong Kong feel alive.12/10________________________________________________________________________________PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:I ran down the street in my Sun Wukong outfit and some jerk hit me with his SUV. I hijacked the nearest bike, caught up with him, stood on it's seat and jumped onto the hood of the SUV.I opened the driver-side door and threw my newly sworn enemy onto the rocky gravel below me to his death. I drove into the sunset, satisfied with my new SUV.I drove the SUV into the Ocean.I am the Emperor of Hong Kong.Don't ♥♥♥♥ with the Emperor.			"

												The first open world game that actually makes you feel like doing the side missions, the story is great and the character development is awesome, except wtf happened to amanda, she just disappeared. Mrs. Chu is just savage which you know is pretty badass for an old lady with that meat cleaver. The game physics is just awesome and also the fighting mechanics are also just way better than gta. Also they don't focus on guns too much which is nice as it brings a change to the frigging arsenal of guns you can pull out of your butt in gta. Well this game honestly has no cons its actually one of the most badass games i have ever played. I would say that you should be able to customize your cars a bit especially some NO2 is required because well there are lots of street races and all.

												Sleeping Dogs is easily one of the most underrated games of the genre.+ Nice graphics+ Very resembling atmosphere of real life Hong Kong+ Nice variety of weapons and vehicles+ Fun missions+ Nice DLCs- No POV options, the camera is a little too close to the character- Very annoying Chinese pronunciation at times. Imagine a game this well made, they still can't get the simple pronunciations right? To some of us it really is bothering.All in all a very nice game with very few minor flaws.8.5/10			"

												it didn't crash yet...a thing that annoys me it's the full controller support (it's not true!!!!!!!!)I've played sleeping dogs in a pc of a friend and its much better, I tried my controller and it works!!!The skin and light shaders are much better!!!!I'm thinking if it's possible to trade this bad version of sleeping dogs (defenitive edition) for the first edition. Or even make a downgrade. I don't think they don't fix the bad skin textures and controller issues....I've unnistalled it, don't worth my money or my effort to try to play a bad upgrade!don't buy it....			"

												great game, great story, decent fighting mechanics. There isn't much that can get in this games way... until they added weapons, of course thugs will use them but what sucks is u can dodge/counter effectively. I don't mean that the weapons do a lot of damage or anything, but the dodging mechanic itself is bugged for the weapons, if a thug has a weapon he's going to smack your face even if u hit dodge waaaaay faster than the game can read it apparently, and then adding a weapons only minigame... self torture can be your thing creators not mine, avoid all minigames that even close to suggest a blade. 3/5			"

												If any one was worried this game is not only a HD revamp. There are also some added content. Little red bags of cash. New cop missions and they got rid of the crap lock on system so combat is smoth. The performance has been improved as well!Before on the original I had to run minimum setings which tanked hard core when on a driving mission. Now I am on medium setings with some slownes but I can still have great control while driving very fast. There is also a cool setting where you can control the amount of cars and people in the city. Lower it for performance and you should be fine if your runing a low end laptop like me. For its price and all the DLC content in it I think its very worth the buy. Defenly get it if you never tryed it before. There are a TON of things to do in this game. Charaters in the game are memorable. Story is great.  "

												This game is amazing. I've never owned a PS3 when the game came out but i got a PC almost a year ago. I was going to get the original on PC but I realized within a few days the Definitive Edition was going to be released. I just Pre-Ordered and got this instead.Thus far the game is AMAZING and i am in love with the graphics. I have an AMD card so it helps run the game. The HD Textures make the game look all the more amazing and the DLCs implemented into the game were added into it so naturally.If you guys haven't gotten the game on PS3 or PC yet, if you haven't bought it yet. I suggest to give it a shot. The game is great and although some people found the story to be pretty ""generic"" seeing as you can already see what the story will lead up to, I got it with the mind set of ""I get to be a part of a Martial Arts Action Flick"". Love the game and I hope others will get the game as well. If you've already gotten the game before though there really is no need considering it's almost exactly the same.			"

Despite the glitches, bugs, and general wonkiness that can still be found I still rate it as one of my all time favorite action 'sandbox' games, falling only behind Red Dead Redemption. If you haven't played it yet, definite 'must buy' category.			"

												Like Grand Theft Auto had sweet, sweet babies with Saints Row in a Hong Kong back alley and abandoned it at the doorstep of a martial arts school. Hong Kong looks beautiful, the combat is incredibly satisfying, but driving is a little hard to get used to if you're used to playing Grand Theft Auto and/or Saints Row. I like the storyline, but it left much to be desired. But you don't play games like this for the story, you play it to kick♥♥♥♥♥and take names.			"

Posted: March 10, 2015
												Right, so where do I start... Once upon a time there was a game called ""Yakuza"" for PS2. At its time it was highly advanced and innovative, open-world (ish) beat'em-up with an interesting story, several side-quests and a street-fights to die for. It was one of my long time favourites and I was really frustrated that it never actually came out for PC.And then I just happened to stumble upon this little masterpiece. And let me tell you - it's everything the ""Yakuza"" ever was and more. This game takes standard ""GTA"" theme but manages to do something a bit different with it. So let's look at the few positive and negative things that, in my view, pretty much make this game what it is.POSITIVE:FIGHTS - Figts, fights and more fights. This is the primary attraction and activity throughout this game. I have seen some reviews that compare this game with another great beat'em-up games - the ""Batman"" series (in favour of the latter). I was really surprised by this fact as ""Batman's"" fighting system is completely different, far less realistic and far less controllable (although just as entertaining). In ""Sleeping Dogs"" you have almost full control over your every punch, kick, counter or grapple. Punch twice and do a jumping kick in the head? Easy. Punch, knee and kick in the face? Can be done. Run at your opponent, dive-tackle him and punch his face in on the ground? No problem. Or just grab your enemy and throw him off the balcony, plant his head in a fish-tank or a burning furnace, smash him into a phone-booth or the bonnet of a nearby car... then kick him in the nuts while he's down. Anything goes. Like I said - it's pretty much like good old ""Yakuza"", where you could utilise your environment to your full advantage. There're also plenty of weapons to be used - knives, hatchets, tire-irons, police-batons, even lady's purses and hand-bags (although you'd look a bit gay, fighting a bunch of big-*** guys with a purse, but hey - if you want, who am I to stop you?). ATMOSPHERE - pretty interesting mix. It's something in between GTA, Deus Ex Human Revolution and Yakuza... I know - you're getting pretty tired of reading the word ""Yakuza"", but this is what this game most reminds me of... so... yeah... YAKUZA (get over it). Hong-Kong really feels like lively, immersive and interesting place to be in. The city really lives - offering plenty of things to do, apart from main or even side quests. Explore, shop, race, gamble, pick a fight with random guys, parkour your *** around alleys and rooftops or just get a massage and buy some food and drink. As it was once said - the man who never eats pork-bun is never a whole man :)STORY - not the most original part, but quite solid and enjoyable. Missions are a good mix of serious, bloody and gory gangster and double-agent work, to completely ridiculous and funny tasks.OUTFITS - yeah, I know - not the most important thing in any game, but one has to agree - running through the city dressed as shaolin monk or hurling people around, wearing an extra-large straw sombrero is quite a bit of laugh. Clothing is plentiful and you can choose anything to fit your style and mood.SHOOTING - pretty basic, but works and can be entertaining in slow-mo, as you jumping over various obstacles.MUSIC - there is good variety of stations to listen to, while you're cruising around the city. And they all fit the atmosphere pretty much spot on.NEGATIVE:Mind you - there are no real negatives in the game. I consider things truly negative, when they spoil the gaming experience and there are no such flaws in ""Sleeping Dogs"". Just several areas that could be improved to make this game even better.DRIVING - ok... developers have clearly focused the most of their effort on hand-to-hand fighting and ""out of the vehicle"" movement. First thing to note about driving - it's hugely unbalanced. Sometimes, you drive a really high-end sport muscle-car and have trouble catching up with an old and beaten mini-bus, you are chasing. Same goes for all races and the police-chases. No matter what you drive - they never f***ing fall behind and leave you be, untill you ram them off the road or shoot up their vehicle. Other thing is that some cars are downright uncontrollable (same goes for boats), with either too sensitive steering or oposite - heavy handling and cornering ablity of 747 jumbo jet.Having said that, there are also plenty of cars that are actually fun to drive. There are some especially good drifters, with which you can do some crazy stuff - like drifting around the corner, flying sideways in between of oncoming cars, stabilise the drift and proceed as normal. Such things really put a proud little grin on your mug. GAMBLING - a huge miss-out in my view. Gambling is done as pretty basic mahjong-poker and cockfights (it's not what you've just thought, you sick b*****d - I meant birds). First one is being quite plain and without any character and the latter is completely random - no skill involved, just choose your bird and hope for the best. So come on devs - if you want to include gambling in your game, watch and learn from Witcher, Far Cry 3, Fallout NV, RAGE and so on. You've already created a brilliant atmosphere in everything else - it's not so hard to also add some character to the gambling, now is it? SIDE-QUESTS VARIETY - side quests are plentiful (which is good), but can get a bit repetitive. I'm being picky here - there's quite a good variety of things to do, but I personally would like just a little touch more of the good thing. I mean - you're undrcover cop and an imposer-triad - there got to be more things for you to do, than resolve petty fights, catch pickpockets, chase cars and respond to a random shoot-outs. But like I said - I'm being picky. And that, pretty much, sums it up. So if you like a bit of everything - bit of driving, bit of parkouring (is there even such word? ... nevermind), bit of exploring, bit of just wandering around the city dressed up as Agent-47 (yes- you can do that) and a lot of fighting, by all means buy this game. If, like me, you are an old Yakuza fan and looking for something similar on PC - than you simply must buy this game. Or if you are just looking for something new to play and can't quite make up your mind - I would give this one a shot. Solid piece of work. P.S. Oh yeah - just in case, I have not said this enough, during my review... YAKUZAAAAAAAAAA.			"

												Not much more to add except if you love Sleeping Dogs (which I do) and you have the original but not the DLC then pick this up for $15. Even at $30 without the DLC it still is worth it as it is much cheaper than buying all the DLC individually. For everyone else the changes really are minimal (graphically) and are really down to personal preference. I must say, playing it through again, for me, it hasn't aged at all and still feels as great experience as it did first time around. I really couldn't say that of GTA IV or maybe even V. This fictional HK is so alive and vibrant and the cast of characters so diverse. A great game.			"

If you have a computer with at least 12G ram and a good graphics card then get it instead of the original sleeping dogs. But i didnt find it had that much improvment. the original with hd pack ran just like this. but definition edition has moving hair and jewelry. little better textures and more breakable objects. but the game runs soo much slower than original sleeping dogs unless you have a big Ram and graphics card			"

												Would I recommend this?  That's actually not a 'yes' or a 'no'.  If you do not own the original, then yes, I would recommend you buy this, as Sleeping Dogs is, in my opinion, a very brilliant and under-rated game.  If you do own the original, then, no, I wouldn't recommend it unless you like the look of enough of the DLC available that you don't already have that this will actually end up being cheaper than buying that DLC.  Why do I say this?  Well, the graphics, once you actually get them working right, do show improvement over the original, and the world feels a bit more populated, but the difference is more of a case of a minor nip and tuck, rather than a jaw-dropping overhaul, so it's not really worth even the discounted price for that alone.

												+ Looks great.  Plenty of detail and interesting things to see in Hong Kong.+ Interesting enough plot though pretty much what you'd expect from a Hong Kong police action movie plot.  Characters are well written and voice acted.+ Combat system works great for melee fighting.- Gun mechanics and missions are pretty terrible and clunky.- Driving mechanics are passable but don't feel real enough.  Things can get a bit twitchy.- Map looks great and is big, but I was hoping for more alleys or things to climb on.  The parkour setpieces that happen in a few missions seemed to be the only places that took advantage of the alleys and rooftops in game.I haven't played a grand theft auto clone in quite a long time.  I find it hard to keep playing them long enough to complete, but this I went through in a few days and really enjoyed it.  I believe way back this was supposed to be part of the True Crime series, and it ended up getting scrapped and retooled into this.  I'm glad the team it went to was able to spend the time to finish up everything properly.  It seems like a lot of love and effort went into it.Not much else to say about this other than it's really well done, and I had a good time playing it.  Recommended.			"

												So after playing this game on the 360 era, (Didn't finish the game. But I was very far)I decided to buy the game on the PC version so I can play it on max settings with 60FPS. I did however bought the PS4 version for cheap, but didn't play it since it was 30FPS. Which is silly and stupid. So, what's my thought on this ""Definitive Edition""Pros: The game can be fun for the side quest. Pros: Fun combat. By far best sandbox game that has Martial Arts. Pros: Fun characters. Cons: The controls sometimes lags with me. I'm using the Xbox One. Cons: This kinda ruined the game for me for the story part. But the subtitles is reallllly small. For a game that sometimes non English speaking, it's hard to read. This really ruins the mood for me if I wanna get deep into the story. Cons: The Definitive Edition is a downgrade to the original game. Other than that, great game. Buy this game? Yes, yes you should. If you find it on sale, get it fast.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Remember that game that Rockstar Games did in the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series known as Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown, now imagine some game developer comes up with that idea, and increases by 200. Mixing GTA with cops and Chinese traditions. You get Sleeping Dogs: Definitive EditionSleeping Dogs is developed by United Front Games and published by Square Enix. The definitive edition has graphical and gameplay improvements as well as additional content such as the inclusion of the DLC's; Nightmare on Northpoint and Year of the DragonYou play an ex-gangster who used to form part of the gang group known as the Sun on Yee who then emigrated to the USA and now is back in Hong Kong. Wei Shen is hired by the Hong Kong Police Department (HKPD) to track and put some of the notorious gangster leaders such as Big Smile Lee in behind bars. Wei has to work with both the police as well as the Sun on Yee, trying not to break cover in the processThe game reminds me of GTA with it's open world Hong Kong, violence, sex, drugs and so on. Sleeping Dogs does not shy away from showing and talking about controversial issues such as prostitution and illegal trafficking, thankfully unlike the GTA series, it is not thrown upon your face when it comes to sex and pornography. The violence, on the other hand is in full swing and I am not saying this as a bad thing, I'm hardly affected by any of the above mentioned (as I have no heart and soul)The story is well written and well paced, not once was I bored out of my mind, and the 10 hour campaign was satisfying to say the least. However, after 10 hours of playing, I felt like, I've had enough of Hong Kong and I did not feel like playing the additional DLC which the game offers, however, I wouldn't mind returning back to Sleeping Dogs to play the DLC in the near futureThe character development was superb especially with Wei and his best friend Jackie, as well as some side characters like Winston and his mother. However, I did feel like the game could have improved the character development on the main villain, Big Smile Lee, he is always mentioned but never shows up until the end which was kind of dissapointingBy many critics and reviewers alike, they have stated that Sleeping Dogs is pretty and has some fantastic graphics in the game for the previous generation of consoles, and I cannot lie, even on PC, the game still holds up even though the game is 4 years old (2012 when the game first came out) and even better only after 2 years (2014 with the definitive edition release)Although I did sometimes notice some framerate dips even though I can play this game on Ultra (Nvidia GeForce GTX980 Ti) and some ugly texture work here and there. But I must say, Hong Kong looks believable and alive even with the improved graphics and weather effectsVoice acting was stellar. The Catonese (or Chinese whatever) language made the game believable and even when the characters spoke in English, it was really well portrayedThe only thing I have to comment about is the music, for me the music wasn't the best. Although not horrible, it certainly wasn't the best music, especially when driving, the copyrighted (yay...) radio music wasn't the best. Grand Theft Auto V had better radio musicThe gameplay is good, the combat is okay although not the best. The only complaints I would give are the cover system and the driving. The cover system is bad, when I want Wei to go into cover, it takes him ages and 600 bullet wounds to enter into cover, even sometimes vaulting over stuff which is not what I wanted him to doAlso, when he runs out of bullets, he just stands up and throws the gun away making me vunerable to being shot, which has happened mutliple times. Although I must say I like the inclusion of the slow-mo shooting when you vault over stuff, kind of reminds me of Max PayneThe driving too is weak and clunky. The cars don't feel heavy enough, they feel as if they are light on their feet and especially when you hit a wall, the car flings itself to the other side just as if you are on a ping pong table!Overall, Sleeping Dogs and the Definitive Edition are a welcome to anyone who loves the GTA series or likes open world games. Sleeping Dogs is a cult classic (like it's a movie pfft) and is ranked a bit lower than Grand Theft Auto V in my books and I would recommend the Definitive Edition to anyone who hasn't already got Sleeping Dogs in their library RECOMMENDED :)  "

												My best friend introduced me to this game, and it quickly became one of my favorites. It tackles two odd tropes: being a cop, and being a cop in Hong Kong. The Asian world is often overlooked as a setting for open-world games, and Sleeping Dogs highlights what a massive mistake it is. Bright neon lights shine overhead as you drive through crowded streets, vendors and tourists plague the sidewalks, and an uncanny mixmatch of colors swirl together to give a strange contrast to the grey and brown of, say, Grand Theft Auto's cities. The game world is, admittedly, a bit too crowded at times, and some textures don't hold up all that well, even in the Definitive Edition, but, when you race along the pavement in the glistening storm, with the life of a city brimming up around you, it's an experience unmatched in its genre. The gameplay is mostly divided into two branches: Triad and Officer. Officer gameplay is most centered around protecting civilians, solving cases through side quests, and generally tackling things in a non-violent fashion. Triad gameplay is a martial arts cousin of the Batman Arkham franchise, with an attack button and a counter button taking up most of your combat controls, with some melee weapons and firearms sprinkled in. You're rewarded with EXP for violent acts, such as environmental takedowns, where you shove someone into a doorway and slam the door on their head, or toss them into a fan and watch their brains become a mess of pink textures and glimmering blood. These are *NOT* morality systems. You're not encouraged to choose one or the other, but rather to balance them both, which is a relieving break from the ""MAKE YOUR CHOICE"" design philosophy that sank the seventh generation. The story is nothing to write home about, but it is intriguing and well-presented. If nothing else, it does an excellent job of mimicking the stress an undercover position would place on an officer, and the conflict of loyalty and respect that would come with it. Wei Shen is a likable protagonist, and he only grows more endearing throughout the game, just like Winston and several of his Triad compatriots, and Raymond and his fellow police officers. There's a stark duality here that is thankfully ignorant of the player's wishes as a deciding factor. You *do not* choose the ending. The ending is prewritten, and it's well-written, which is more than I can say for several player-determinant stories.I can't recommend this game enough. If you enjoy other crime-centric open-world titles, such as Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row, and want to try something new, you'll find it in Sleeping Dogs. It's odd and charming all at once, with a thick layer of polish to keep it running with its heart shining through. It's clear the people who developed this game cared about making a good game, and I think that's all that really needs to be said.			"

In terms of custumization, cars, outfits, girlfriends, side missions and city scale, it's on par with GTA IV, but with San Andreas or Vice City's arcade style, for a kung fu movie cinematic atmosphere. Really good, really cheap.Played it on PC and Mac as well, excellent performances on both.			"

												As Wei Shen you'll be infiltrating the Sun On Yee Triad in an effort to bring it down not only to do your duty as a police officer but also to avenge your sister, who died of an overdose after being introduged to drugs by a triad member.Sleeping Dogs is a truly good game providing an interesting storyline, realistic open world, a good amount of quests and side activities and a fun melee combat system: the Definitive Edition features several improvements such as better graphics, more side missions and previously released DLC.PROS:-great plot, the story is truly engaging and mantains a good momentum from beginning to end-a good cast of characters that, while not extremely deep, manage to be as realistic as they are interesting-Hong Kong is a very interesting setting and one the devs managed to recreate very well both in looks and ambience: it truly feels alive-good graphics overall, while not extremely detailed they feature many small details both on characters and in the game world-excellent soundtrack, the ingame radios have a good amount of different genres available and, while not as famous as GTA, they're all very good-huge amount of things to do between main missions, side quests, favours, lockboxes, cop jobs and even more collectibles-meleee combat is extremely fun and gets better as you unlock new moves, gunplay happens a bit less often (especially at the beginning) but works well and has a decent cover system-the extra content from the DLCs adds even more hours to a long base gameCONS:-if you already played the base game, the graphical improvements are generally minor-some extra activities (races, cop jobs) can get repetitve in the long run-camera can sometimes turn at awkard angles during melee fights or while entering a vehicle-a few hiccups with the AI, especially pedestrian or civilian drivers-lacks Cloud saving-a few bugs here and there (a cutscene zooming out due to my character getting slightly stuck on a rock, some NPCs getting stuck on scenery,a couple flashing textures): very minor things though


Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition 
A Screenshot of Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition
By: stranger1982




Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition was a joy to play, and I say so as someone who had played the original game back then and decided to replay it in its improved form: the story is great, Wei Shen is a good lead character and the plethora of missions, activities and stuff to buy/ collect ensures you never have time to get bored. If you somehow missed the game back in 2012 then you owe to yourself to buy this one.Igf you already own the base game, well, I'd be worthwhile to get this one if you havn't experienced the story DLCs since they'll add about 2 hours each.I got this on sale for around 8$ and got 30ish hours out of it, that's a great bang for your buck: if you also consider the game's quality, they make Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition a game I fully recommend, previous consideration notwithstanding.

												Like Grand Theft Auto had sweet, sweet babies with Saints Row in a Hong Kong back alley and abandoned it at the doorstep of a martial arts school. Hong Kong looks beautiful, the combat is incredibly satisfying, but driving is a little hard to get used to if you're used to playing Grand Theft Auto and/or Saints Row. I like the storyline, but it left much to be desired. But you don't play games like this for the story, you play it to kick♥♥♥♥♥and take names.			"

Posted: March 10, 2015
												Right, so where do I start... Once upon a time there was a game called ""Yakuza"" for PS2. At its time it was highly advanced and innovative, open-world (ish) beat'em-up with an interesting story, several side-quests and a street-fights to die for. It was one of my long time favourites and I was really frustrated that it never actually came out for PC.And then I just happened to stumble upon this little masterpiece. And let me tell you - it's everything the ""Yakuza"" ever was and more. This game takes standard ""GTA"" theme but manages to do something a bit different with it. So let's look at the few positive and negative things that, in my view, pretty much make this game what it is.POSITIVE:FIGHTS - Figts, fights and more fights. This is the primary attraction and activity throughout this game. I have seen some reviews that compare this game with another great beat'em-up games - the ""Batman"" series (in favour of the latter). I was really surprised by this fact as ""Batman's"" fighting system is completely different, far less realistic and far less controllable (although just as entertaining). In ""Sleeping Dogs"" you have almost full control over your every punch, kick, counter or grapple. Punch twice and do a jumping kick in the head? Easy. Punch, knee and kick in the face? Can be done. Run at your opponent, dive-tackle him and punch his face in on the ground? No problem. Or just grab your enemy and throw him off the balcony, plant his head in a fish-tank or a burning furnace, smash him into a phone-booth or the bonnet of a nearby car... then kick him in the nuts while he's down. Anything goes. Like I said - it's pretty much like good old ""Yakuza"", where you could utilise your environment to your full advantage. There're also plenty of weapons to be used - knives, hatchets, tire-irons, police-batons, even lady's purses and hand-bags (although you'd look a bit gay, fighting a bunch of big-*** guys with a purse, but hey - if you want, who am I to stop you?). ATMOSPHERE - pretty interesting mix. It's something in between GTA, Deus Ex Human Revolution and Yakuza... I know - you're getting pretty tired of reading the word ""Yakuza"", but this is what this game most reminds me of... so... yeah... YAKUZA (get over it). Hong-Kong really feels like lively, immersive and interesting place to be in. The city really lives - offering plenty of things to do, apart from main or even side quests. Explore, shop, race, gamble, pick a fight with random guys, parkour your *** around alleys and rooftops or just get a massage and buy some food and drink. As it was once said - the man who never eats pork-bun is never a whole man :)STORY - not the most original part, but quite solid and enjoyable. Missions are a good mix of serious, bloody and gory gangster and double-agent work, to completely ridiculous and funny tasks.OUTFITS - yeah, I know - not the most important thing in any game, but one has to agree - running through the city dressed as shaolin monk or hurling people around, wearing an extra-large straw sombrero is quite a bit of laugh. Clothing is plentiful and you can choose anything to fit your style and mood.SHOOTING - pretty basic, but works and can be entertaining in slow-mo, as you jumping over various obstacles.MUSIC - there is good variety of stations to listen to, while you're cruising around the city. And they all fit the atmosphere pretty much spot on.NEGATIVE:Mind you - there are no real negatives in the game. I consider things truly negative, when they spoil the gaming experience and there are no such flaws in ""Sleeping Dogs"". Just several areas that could be improved to make this game even better.DRIVING - ok... developers have clearly focused the most of their effort on hand-to-hand fighting and ""out of the vehicle"" movement. First thing to note about driving - it's hugely unbalanced. Sometimes, you drive a really high-end sport muscle-car and have trouble catching up with an old and beaten mini-bus, you are chasing. Same goes for all races and the police-chases. No matter what you drive - they never f***ing fall behind and leave you be, untill you ram them off the road or shoot up their vehicle. Other thing is that some cars are downright uncontrollable (same goes for boats), with either too sensitive steering or oposite - heavy handling and cornering ablity of 747 jumbo jet.Having said that, there are also plenty of cars that are actually fun to drive. There are some especially good drifters, with which you can do some crazy stuff - like drifting around the corner, flying sideways in between of oncoming cars, stabilise the drift and proceed as normal. Such things really put a proud little grin on your mug. GAMBLING - a huge miss-out in my view. Gambling is done as pretty basic mahjong-poker and cockfights (it's not what you've just thought, you sick b*****d - I meant birds). First one is being quite plain and without any character and the latter is completely random - no skill involved, just choose your bird and hope for the best. So come on devs - if you want to include gambling in your game, watch and learn from Witcher, Far Cry 3, Fallout NV, RAGE and so on. You've already created a brilliant atmosphere in everything else - it's not so hard to also add some character to the gambling, now is it? SIDE-QUESTS VARIETY - side quests are plentiful (which is good), but can get a bit repetitive. I'm being picky here - there's quite a good variety of things to do, but I personally would like just a little touch more of the good thing. I mean - you're undrcover cop and an imposer-triad - there got to be more things for you to do, than resolve petty fights, catch pickpockets, chase cars and respond to a random shoot-outs. But like I said - I'm being picky. And that, pretty much, sums it up. So if you like a bit of everything - bit of driving, bit of parkouring (is there even such word? ... nevermind), bit of exploring, bit of just wandering around the city dressed up as Agent-47 (yes- you can do that) and a lot of fighting, by all means buy this game. If, like me, you are an old Yakuza fan and looking for something similar on PC - than you simply must buy this game. Or if you are just looking for something new to play and can't quite make up your mind - I would give this one a shot. Solid piece of work. P.S. Oh yeah - just in case, I have not said this enough, during my review... YAKUZAAAAAAAAAA.			"

												Sleeping Dogs may not look like what it actually is. That's because the game was first called True Crime: Hongkong, which gives much more of a hint on what the game actually is all about.  For several reasons, Activision abandoned the development of True Crime: Hongkong in 2011, when the game was almost completely finished. Square Enix acquired the publishing rights to the game, but not the True Crime intellectual property, so they had to rename it: Sleeping Dogs was born and released in 2012 for PC and the potatoes. In 2014 the PC and next gen consoles version got a graphical overhaul which was released as the Definitive Edition.Story/setting: The game is a GTA-like open-world adventure set in Hong Kong where as an undercover cop you try to work up in the ranks of a Hong Kong street gang to infiltrate the powerful Triads, the Chinese mafia. I guess it’s a somewhat typical story of trust, job ethics and betrayal mixed with a good portion of Hollywood action of magically surviving even the worst of tortures and the like. It’s surprisingly brutal and serious though, which I like a lot. What makes it a very good story however is the perfect blend with traditional Chinese culture and values (importance of family, personal faith). Beside the persisting violence there are these moments of calm and meditation that make you think and appreciate the effort the devs put into making some witty and authentic dialogue. The voice-acting and dialogue in general are exceptional, there is really nothing to complain there. The characters are fleshed-out enough for you to remember them and their voices for quite a while…  and get emotionally involved when they get horribly murdered in great numbers .Graphics/sound design: The buffed looks of the Definitive Edition are definitely an eye-catcher; especially the cut-scenes look really impressive with good character models and animation even in close-up shots. Animations are smooth in general, which is important due to the prevalence of combo-based melee combat and the cover-shooter mechanics. Texture quality is good I guess, nothing exceptional here, but it’s an open-world game so I wouldn’t expect them to put HD textures on everything. The weather effects are kinda nice; driving around in grey, rainy Hong Kong is pretty dank I gotta say. Sound effects are nothing special, the fact that you have a pretty large array of radio tunes on a number of different channels when driving is a neat idea though, there’s some great songs there that would instantly remind me of the streets of Hong Kong every time I hear them again.Mechanics: There’s a lot of different stuff to do in Sleeping Dogs, really a lot, there’s just not a huge amount of depth to it. The plethora of fighting techniques and minigames was just wide and deep enough to not have me bored by the time I had finished the game though. So I guess it’s not a negative point, but also not a huge plus. You can hack cameras, pick locks, take photos of your one-night-stands, beat up bad guys with a myriad of combos, shoot at the tires of your chasers while driving, hijack cars at full speed on the highway (this is very cool believe me), win street races, play with your smartphone, trace phone call signals, crack open locked boxes, buy smart-looking clothes (you can even buy a fedora, I had a very euphoric moment there), speed around the sea in muthafugging boats, BOAT RACES, sing karaoke (and purposefully mess up to complete a sidequest), perform environmental kills (who doesn’t want to put their opponent’s head in a running circular saw?), get chased by the police, and probably a lot more I can’t remember at this point; so yeah, pretty damn diverse. The combat may seem very difficult at the beginning (it did to me because I am a retard and never play combo-based fighting games), but it gets incredibly easy once you get the hang of it. Character customization is alright, there’s two “progression trees” you can develop: Cops and Triads, that award you with points depending on how well you did in every mission (you get less cops points if you kill innocent civilians for example), the fighting combos are gained by returning statues to your melee trainer found throughout the main game.Performance: Ferry goot in all regards. I think I had the occasional crash but it wasn’t too bothersome, Steam overlay also didn’t work first for some reason. Other than that mostly 60fps on max settings on a 7950/7970 CFX and a 4770k, nothing to complain there.Should you play this game? Yes, the story is thrilling and thought-out enough for you to make it a worthwhile experience. The Chinese setting is a big plus for everyone into a completely different cultural context. Sleeping Dog’s Hong Kong has a unique feel and character to it, that’s for sure. There’s plenty enough variety in mechanics for you not to get bored in these ~25 hours of gameplay the game has to offer. It’s also pretty to look at. It’s a well-executed triple-A title overall, buy it discounted like I did and you won’t regret your purchase.  "

												The more I played the game, the more I enjoyed it. This barely happens to me. At first, the graphics amazed me. They recreated the city of Hong Kong in a quiet realistic way. Lights, reflections, models, everything just works fine. With the voices and sound effects, they achieved a city full of life. My main problem was at the beginning, that the story was confusing and hectic. Even if I didn't do that much side missions between the main parts, I totally lost. Later, it become clear and I liked it.  Speaking of these side missions, they're interesting. The races, police jobs, car chases, catching thiefs and many other unique tasks are well made. It guarantees a play time far above 25 hours, so definitely a good choice if you're looking for an open word action rpg. There are very few bugs, and they don't really affect your gameplay. 8.5/10			"

Vast Hong Kong city places to visit, foods to eat not without it's flaws though there are a lot of one sided characters that appear for mission or two then you just forget about em, but there is also a lot of memorable characters in latter stage of the game that you just gonna loveGameplay is tons of fun with varied triad and cop missions the movement of characters are fluid and so is combat, driving lacks though  gotta give extra props for amazing soundtracks and good radio tracks I haven't touched the DLC yet but I suggest this game for people who enjoy good story with GTA-esque gameplay			"

												3 AM in Hong Kong. A group of thugs loiter around a parking lot, waiting for the drug-dealing boss to come back with their pork buns. Suddenly a police motorcycle crashes through a barrier, Cantonese hip hop music blaring. The rider, Wei Shen, wearing a purple puffy coat and aviator sunglasses, leaps off, dramatically drawing his pistol as he falls through the air in slow motion, frantically firing at one thug before finally managing to hit the headshot. Wei proceeds to knee each thug in the groin before throwing them into nearby dumpsters and trunks. With the thugs in pieces and/or car trunks, he hacks the nearby security camera, hops back on his motorcycle, and peels out of the parking lot as the song starts over from the beginning. He hits several pedestrians but doesn't stop, because he's feeling hungry. Hungry for pork buns.			"

												Not much more to add except if you love Sleeping Dogs (which I do) and you have the original but not the DLC then pick this up for $15. Even at $30 without the DLC it still is worth it as it is much cheaper than buying all the DLC individually. For everyone else the changes really are minimal (graphically) and are really down to personal preference. I must say, playing it through again, for me, it hasn't aged at all and still feels as great experience as it did first time around. I really couldn't say that of GTA IV or maybe even V. This fictional HK is so alive and vibrant and the cast of characters so diverse. A great game.			"

If you do not own the original, then yes, I would recommend you buy this, as Sleeping Dogs is, in my opinion, a very brilliant and under-rated game.  If you do own the original, then, no, I wouldn't recommend it unless you like the look of enough of the DLC available that you don't already have that this will actually end up being cheaper than buying that DLC.  Why do I say this?  Well, the graphics, once you actually get them working right, do show improvement over the original, and the world feels a bit more populated, but the difference is more of a case of a minor nip and tuck, rather than a jaw-dropping overhaul, so it's not really worth even the discounted price for that alone.

												Wow! I should say that I haven't played Sleeping Dogs first-issue, and can't judge how much it changed (or not).. But, what i saw here, like seeing totally new game, is much better than GTA IV. Can't compare to GTA V cause I haven't got (and don't like) console and haven't played it yet.I always thought that GTA is unique and I love this whole series from the time when it was 2d, you know. And now.. Sleeping Dogs.. Wow..Its really well done - fighting system is fascinating! I really like how its is animated, how it is feels and the difficulty is perfect tuned for me. Every fight you can win without spending 999 tries like in Dark Souls, but if you relax a bit and go casual style - you lose - its just perfect!Second - I like the car physics - its way better than in GTA IV. Also a small detail - traffic goes left handed in HongKong - it is a trifle, but I don't know why it fascinates me. Feels so fresh :)Also I really like China spirit and have not much respect for American one. Yes - they all gangsters in both games, but Americans feels so empty and dumb, and Chinesse.. they have history much bigger than ours and it matters.What more to say.. I really happy that I found this game and will go continue playing ^_^P.S. I haven't completed or even played much yet, but I realized that I want to go here and write the review immediately!			"

												I think Definition edition is kind of good if you already own sleeping dogs. I had the original sleeping dogs with the Hd pack and i didnt see much difference to the definition editon. If you have a computer with at least 12G ram and a good graphics card then get it instead of the original sleeping dogs. But i didnt find it had that much improvment. the original with hd pack ran just like this. but definition edition has moving hair and jewelry. little better textures and more breakable objects. but the game runs soo much slower than original sleeping dogs unless you have a big Ram and graphics card			"

												Okay so i've got Sleeping Dogs, and i came in expecting a somewhat NEW game since this is my first time buying a ""remake"" edition or whatever they call it.  The game is fun, if you don't have the actual game yet then get this 100% However, if you've already got the game, completed the game or don't have the DLC's then it's not really worth it. However this game is amazing, so i bought it anyway since i wanted to replay it. Better story than GTA in my opinion, amazing sceneary and not the old boring Americas. What i did notice, it doesn't have many customization options, clothing is bare, so are cars.			"

												The destructible environments add to the already great combat. There are way more and varied people around in the game world and I love how they have integrated the DLC into the main game. You no longer just get a bunch of free stuff in your wardrobe and garage, you either have to buy the stuff from a special vendor or earn some of them from missions in the game. Even the Red Envelopes are now hidden packages instead of just right next to the garages like before. To me it really balances out the game much better then before. The only DLC it doesn't seem to include is the Top Dog Gold and Silver packs that let you level up, it would have been nice to have the option to use them in this version but overall I am kind of glad they are not there as that did make the old version very easy and less fun to me.The improvements are very good in this version and don't believe the people saying this game looks worse then the HD pack from the old version because that is total BS. Whatever their reason or agenda is I'm not sure, but look for yourself at real images from an impartial sight and not some jokers personal images that could be from the lowest settings or even the original game.http://tech4gamers.com/sleeping-dogs-sd-vs-sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-graphics-comparison-and-benchmarks/ "

												The more I played the game, the more I enjoyed it. This barely happens to me. At first, the graphics amazed me. They recreated the city of Hong Kong in a quiet realistic way. Lights, reflections, models, everything just works fine. With the voices and sound effects, they achieved a city full of life. My main problem was at the beginning, that the story was confusing and hectic. Even if I didn't do that much side missions between the main parts, I totally lost. Later, it become clear and I liked it.  Speaking of these side missions, they're interesting. The races, police jobs, car chases, catching thiefs and many other unique tasks are well made. It guarantees a play time far above 25 hours, so definitely a good choice if you're looking for an open word action rpg. There are very few bugs, and they don't really affect your gameplay. 8.5/10			"

												Not much more to add except if you love Sleeping Dogs (which I do) and you have the original but not the DLC then pick this up for $15. Even at $30 without the DLC it still is worth it as it is much cheaper than buying all the DLC individually. For everyone else the changes really are minimal (graphically) and are really down to personal preference. I must say, playing it through again, for me, it hasn't aged at all and still feels as great experience as it did first time around. I really couldn't say that of GTA IV or maybe even V. This fictional HK is so alive and vibrant and the cast of characters so diverse. A great game.			"

												This game is amazing. I've never owned a PS3 when the game came out but i got a PC almost a year ago. I was going to get the original on PC but I realized within a few days the Definitive Edition was going to be released. I just Pre-Ordered and got this instead.Thus far the game is AMAZING and i am in love with the graphics. I have an AMD card so it helps run the game. The HD Textures make the game look all the more amazing and the DLCs implemented into the game were added into it so naturally.If you guys haven't gotten the game on PS3 or PC yet, if you haven't bought it yet. I suggest to give it a shot. The game is great and although some people found the story to be pretty ""generic"" seeing as you can already see what the story will lead up to, I got it with the mind set of ""I get to be a part of a Martial Arts Action Flick"". Love the game and I hope others will get the game as well. If you've already gotten the game before though there really is no need considering it's almost exactly the same.			"

												This is one of those games that you may have missed for whatever reason.  I know I missed it and eventually got it on Steam.  After letting it sit in my library for some unknown period of time I decided to play it.I'd have to puut this game somewhere between GTA and Saints Row.  The story and humor is a little more like GTA while driving mechanics are a little more inaccurate like Saints Row.Combat is pretty good though as the hand to hand feels more like Assassin's Creed without the inventory.  The Triad story is pretty good while the cop side is fairly lame in comparison.  The graphics are somewhat dated by now but are in no way ugly or rough.All in all this game is pretty good at about 12 hours in but I feel it's best played with a controller instead of keyboard/mouse.  Something about hand to hand with a keyboard just doesn't feel right to me but that's a matter of opinion.			"

												I am not one to normally write reviews but I felt I had to for this gem. I admit I only purchased this game because it was on sale for the holidays, and I am glad I did. I don't know how I missed this game when it was first released but it is a shame. I really enjoyed the atmosphere this game had. It was a highly stylized version of Hong Kong, with all the neon and grittiness  I would expect from a good action flick. I liked how most of the combat was melee, but guns still had their place. I had no problem with the controls nor the camara angles. I don't want to say too much about the story but it was enjoyable and having 2 aspects to your characters personality added a little more depth to the character then most games have. So if you have some disposable income and you enjoy open world story telling get this game.			"

												Definitely worth the purchase. I'd absolutely recommened this to anyone who is into fighting, cop, corrupt gang fighting games. Has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of action towards it and an excellent fighting martial arts system. The only thing I can complain about is the driving mechanism but that's about it. The game in general works perfectly fine with a low end pc and high end. Before purchasing this game check your specs first on your pc and don't ♥♥♥♥♥ to the company because you bought a game that your pc couldn't run. I'd give the game 9/10 if they fixed the car driving mechanism but yeah I'd definitely give 10/10 for Sleeping dogs if that was fixed.Game includes all the 24 dlc packs and some you have to unlock in the game. Awesome story line as well considering i've finished the campaign 4 times now.			"

The game has fantastic voice acting, animations and characters. The game comes with many dramatic losses as well as adrenaline driven missions. I would 100% suggest this to anyone that enjoys free roam and action. There is something about hopping from one car to another in a high speed chase which makes your heart rushing.			"

												THIS GAME HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BEAT GTA!!!The game has nice graphics similar to the latest GTA series:GTA V.However,it has features that GTA doesn't have such as:-Ability to have multiple vehicles;regardless of cars or motorcycle parked in the parking-lot similar to the mechanics of a garage.-Martial arts ofc!It has an interesting story line with the hero being a guy named Wei Shen,an undercover cop situated in Hong Kong and disguised as a gangster to tackle the crimes in HK.It gets interesting as the story goes as Wei slowly meets gang leaders and well,I wouldn't spoil the experience for those who haven't bought this game.IF YOU HAVEN'T BUY THIS GAME YET,BUY IT!!!Btw,martial arts ftw :D			"

												+ very beautiful digital hong kong+ surprising good combat system, a mix of martial arts and kung fu+ good dramatic story+ many things to do+ big difference between crappy and expensive cars (acceleration, handling etc), even a bigger differnce than in gta+ good synchronisation+ good leveling/xp system+ motivating mission rewards+ all dlc's of the original sleeping dogs included- sometimes the camera positioning isn't that useful- sometimes the game doesn't react, for example in combat situations- no flying vehicles- no weapon shops- the first 1-2h aren't that good (tutorials, walk around missions, fight arenas with 10 enemies -> a little bit unbalanced)- can crash on windows 10 when the touch panel service is activated			"

												I actually got Sleeping Dogs for a Reddit gift exchange. I expected the game to be horrible, turns out I was sucked into the story line. The game itself if full of action and adventure. The driving mechanic is a bit wonky and unrealistic much like Watchdogs. I would rate this game a 8/10!			"

												basically a bruce lee simulator with guns and cat demonsexcept that it's a lot more beautiful than the original, as well as being more optimized, even for less powerful PC's with the new low-res buffers. It includes all the DLC (except the cheat one's that make the game less fun by giving you too much power at the start)*FOR OWNERS OF THE ORIGINAL SLEEPING DOGS, YOUR SAVE WILL NOT TRANSFER TO THE DEFINITIVE VERSION SO IF YOU BUY THIS VERSION, REGARDLESS IF YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL SLEEPING DOGS INSTALLED OR NOT, YOU WILL NEED TO RESTART THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN*there isn't a whole lot of content expanded upon from the original sleeping dogs, but it's still a wonderful and beautiful game to play. it's also a hell of a lot cheaper than buying all the individual DLC's for the original if you're one of those people who own it10/10 if you haven't tried the original for people who do own the original yet want this, it would be very wise to get this on sale.

												Bought Sleepy Dogs a second time as this Defitive Edition and played through it again. Know what? Still really, really damn good. I generally get bored with GTA and games such as those rather quickly, which I think is because they generally have boring combat and not that engaging stories. Slippy Dogs hits the nail on the head when it comes to these. Its storyline is super fun. It can be a goofy action movie one mission and get pretty dark in another, while generally mixing up the mission structure in fun ways. You're not really shooting dudes all the time like in GTA. Guns are actually quite a rare find and you'll typically only find and use them in certain missions. This is good! GTA's combat gets kinda boring. You know, how you just lock on to some fella and hold R or whatever. That's not fun. In Slurpee Dogs, you're constantly jumping off tabes, out of cover, off of rails and getting good air-time in general, because whenever you do you'll get into a bullet-time mode and shoot fools all John Woo style. It's super satisfying. Wei Shen really loves jumping on, off or over stuff and it makes travelsal, especially in action packed sequences, actually fun. And by not having to do all this every damn mission, you actually enjoy it each time gun-sections come around and really savor them.Hand to hand is the core of the combat and it is solid. Nothing groundbreaking but it's good, which is a rarity in itself. It's an action, counter and grab type of system with a bunch of really cool modifiers to the regular attacks, some of which quite gruesome, that make each fight sequence a real treat, visually, aurally and in terms of gameplay. You can string together a bunch of stuff, grab melee weapons, throw dudes into environmental hazards, throw some more dudes into more gnarly hazards and really take in the wrath Wei Shen just brought down on those guys by the amount of blood he's covered in. It's cheesy, but effective.But driving around its sandbox world would still be boring like most of the other games in this genre, you say. AHA! It's not. Well, it depends on you of course. It's got all sorts of interesting challenges like driving safely as long as possible, hitting max speed as long as possible, doing wheelies of bikes. It tracks all of this stuff and pits you against your friends in leaderboards in all sorts of categories (not exclusive to driving), kind of like an Autolog/Battlelog sort of thing. It's a nice way of spicing a gameplay segment up that can generally develolve into tedium after several hours. Apart from that, there's a healthy amount of stuff to do and see around the map. From wacky side-missions to dudes to fight some more, collectibles, and, most importantly, that damn karaoke minigame. It's fun, have a go at it, and only then judge me.  Alright. Seriously, if you haven't yet, give Slip in Dungs a shot. It's an all-around entertaining game with a lot of heart that, unless you really don't like action movies or fun in general, I don't see how anyone wouldn't be able to enjoy.			"

												+ Looks great.  Plenty of detail and interesting things to see in Hong Kong.+ Interesting enough plot though pretty much what you'd expect from a Hong Kong police action movie plot.  Characters are well written and voice acted.+ Combat system works great for melee fighting.- Gun mechanics and missions are pretty terrible and clunky.- Driving mechanics are passable but don't feel real enough.  Things can get a bit twitchy.- Map looks great and is big, but I was hoping for more alleys or things to climb on.  The parkour setpieces that happen in a few missions seemed to be the only places that took advantage of the alleys and rooftops in game.I haven't played a grand theft auto clone in quite a long time.  I find it hard to keep playing them long enough to complete, but this I went through in a few days and really enjoyed it.  I believe way back this was supposed to be part of the True Crime series, and it ended up getting scrapped and retooled into this.  I'm glad the team it went to was able to spend the time to finish up everything properly.  It seems like a lot of love and effort went into it.Not much else to say about this other than it's really well done, and I had a good time playing it.  Recommended.			"

												Should you play this game? Yes, and here's why: -The story is badass and at times very brutal.-The setting is a busy, gang-ridden urban Hong Kong with lots of bad Chinese English. You can almost smell the dim sum.-You feel like you're in a Hong Kong crime action film -The fighting is satisfying enough without being too sensitive.-Some challenges actually very challenging (beware poison knives challenge)Some things to be warned:-At times doing the many side missions can become very reptitive and boring. I have done so many drug busts from the comfort of my home in this game that it felt like checking the mail. -The models of NPCs don't vary much, especially the street gang members. It really took away from the big city feel beating up the same guys wearing the same clothes everywhere.-Though it took me 40 hours to go through this game at a leisurely gaming pace (doing side missions as I pleased, not investing too much into beating the game), I felt like the middle lacked depth. The bread on the sandwich was good, but the meat was old and dry. TLDR; Good Story. Repetitive. Get it on sale only.			"

Vast Hong Kong city places to visit, foods to eat not without it's flaws though there are a lot of one sided characters that appear for mission or two then you just forget about em, but there is also a lot of memorable characters in latter stage of the game that you just gonna loveGameplay is tons of fun with varied triad and cop missions the movement of characters are fluid and so is combat, driving lacks though  gotta give extra props for amazing soundtracks and good radio tracks I haven't touched the DLC yet but I suggest this game for people who enjoy good story with GTA-esque gameplay			"

												The more I played the game, the more I enjoyed it. This barely happens to me. At first, the graphics amazed me. They recreated the city of Hong Kong in a quiet realistic way. Lights, reflections, models, everything just works fine. With the voices and sound effects, they achieved a city full of life. My main problem was at the beginning, that the story was confusing and hectic. Even if I didn't do that much side missions between the main parts, I totally lost. Later, it become clear and I liked it.  Speaking of these side missions, they're interesting. The races, police jobs, car chases, catching thiefs and many other unique tasks are well made. It guarantees a play time far above 25 hours, so definitely a good choice if you're looking for an open word action rpg. There are very few bugs, and they don't really affect your gameplay. 8.5/10			"

Posted: March 10, 2015
												Right, so where do I start... Once upon a time there was a game called ""Yakuza"" for PS2. At its time it was highly advanced and innovative, open-world (ish) beat'em-up with an interesting story, several side-quests and a street-fights to die for. It was one of my long time favourites and I was really frustrated that it never actually came out for PC.And then I just happened to stumble upon this little masterpiece. And let me tell you - it's everything the ""Yakuza"" ever was and more. This game takes standard ""GTA"" theme but manages to do something a bit different with it. So let's look at the few positive and negative things that, in my view, pretty much make this game what it is.POSITIVE:FIGHTS - Figts, fights and more fights. This is the primary attraction and activity throughout this game. I have seen some reviews that compare this game with another great beat'em-up games - the ""Batman"" series (in favour of the latter). I was really surprised by this fact as ""Batman's"" fighting system is completely different, far less realistic and far less controllable (although just as entertaining). In ""Sleeping Dogs"" you have almost full control over your every punch, kick, counter or grapple. Punch twice and do a jumping kick in the head? Easy. Punch, knee and kick in the face? Can be done. Run at your opponent, dive-tackle him and punch his face in on the ground? No problem. Or just grab your enemy and throw him off the balcony, plant his head in a fish-tank or a burning furnace, smash him into a phone-booth or the bonnet of a nearby car... then kick him in the nuts while he's down. Anything goes. Like I said - it's pretty much like good old ""Yakuza"", where you could utilise your environment to your full advantage. There're also plenty of weapons to be used - knives, hatchets, tire-irons, police-batons, even lady's purses and hand-bags (although you'd look a bit gay, fighting a bunch of big-*** guys with a purse, but hey - if you want, who am I to stop you?). ATMOSPHERE - pretty interesting mix. It's something in between GTA, Deus Ex Human Revolution and Yakuza... I know - you're getting pretty tired of reading the word ""Yakuza"", but this is what this game most reminds me of... so... yeah... YAKUZA (get over it). Hong-Kong really feels like lively, immersive and interesting place to be in. The city really lives - offering plenty of things to do, apart from main or even side quests. Explore, shop, race, gamble, pick a fight with random guys, parkour your *** around alleys and rooftops or just get a massage and buy some food and drink. As it was once said - the man who never eats pork-bun is never a whole man :)STORY - not the most original part, but quite solid and enjoyable. Missions are a good mix of serious, bloody and gory gangster and double-agent work, to completely ridiculous and funny tasks.OUTFITS - yeah, I know - not the most important thing in any game, but one has to agree - running through the city dressed as shaolin monk or hurling people around, wearing an extra-large straw sombrero is quite a bit of laugh. Clothing is plentiful and you can choose anything to fit your style and mood.SHOOTING - pretty basic, but works and can be entertaining in slow-mo, as you jumping over various obstacles.MUSIC - there is good variety of stations to listen to, while you're cruising around the city. And they all fit the atmosphere pretty much spot on.NEGATIVE:Mind you - there are no real negatives in the game. I consider things truly negative, when they spoil the gaming experience and there are no such flaws in ""Sleeping Dogs"". Just several areas that could be improved to make this game even better.DRIVING - ok... developers have clearly focused the most of their effort on hand-to-hand fighting and ""out of the vehicle"" movement. First thing to note about driving - it's hugely unbalanced. Sometimes, you drive a really high-end sport muscle-car and have trouble catching up with an old and beaten mini-bus, you are chasing. Same goes for all races and the police-chases. No matter what you drive - they never f***ing fall behind and leave you be, untill you ram them off the road or shoot up their vehicle. Other thing is that some cars are downright uncontrollable (same goes for boats), with either too sensitive steering or oposite - heavy handling and cornering ablity of 747 jumbo jet.Having said that, there are also plenty of cars that are actually fun to drive. There are some especially good drifters, with which you can do some crazy stuff - like drifting around the corner, flying sideways in between of oncoming cars, stabilise the drift and proceed as normal. Such things really put a proud little grin on your mug. GAMBLING - a huge miss-out in my view. Gambling is done as pretty basic mahjong-poker and cockfights (it's not what you've just thought, you sick b*****d - I meant birds). First one is being quite plain and without any character and the latter is completely random - no skill involved, just choose your bird and hope for the best. So come on devs - if you want to include gambling in your game, watch and learn from Witcher, Far Cry 3, Fallout NV, RAGE and so on. You've already created a brilliant atmosphere in everything else - it's not so hard to also add some character to the gambling, now is it? SIDE-QUESTS VARIETY - side quests are plentiful (which is good), but can get a bit repetitive. I'm being picky here - there's quite a good variety of things to do, but I personally would like just a little touch more of the good thing. I mean - you're undrcover cop and an imposer-triad - there got to be more things for you to do, than resolve petty fights, catch pickpockets, chase cars and respond to a random shoot-outs. But like I said - I'm being picky. And that, pretty much, sums it up. So if you like a bit of everything - bit of driving, bit of parkouring (is there even such word? ... nevermind), bit of exploring, bit of just wandering around the city dressed up as Agent-47 (yes- you can do that) and a lot of fighting, by all means buy this game. If, like me, you are an old Yakuza fan and looking for something similar on PC - than you simply must buy this game. Or if you are just looking for something new to play and can't quite make up your mind - I would give this one a shot. Solid piece of work. P.S. Oh yeah - just in case, I have not said this enough, during my review... YAKUZAAAAAAAAAA.			"

												Sleeping Dogs may not look like what it actually is. That's because the game was first called True Crime: Hongkong, which gives much more of a hint on what the game actually is all about.  For several reasons, Activision abandoned the development of True Crime: Hongkong in 2011, when the game was almost completely finished. Square Enix acquired the publishing rights to the game, but not the True Crime intellectual property, so they had to rename it: Sleeping Dogs was born and released in 2012 for PC and the potatoes. In 2014 the PC and next gen consoles version got a graphical overhaul which was released as the Definitive Edition.Story/setting: The game is a GTA-like open-world adventure set in Hong Kong where as an undercover cop you try to work up in the ranks of a Hong Kong street gang to infiltrate the powerful Triads, the Chinese mafia. I guess it’s a somewhat typical story of trust, job ethics and betrayal mixed with a good portion of Hollywood action of magically surviving even the worst of tortures and the like. It’s surprisingly brutal and serious though, which I like a lot. What makes it a very good story however is the perfect blend with traditional Chinese culture and values (importance of family, personal faith). Beside the persisting violence there are these moments of calm and meditation that make you think and appreciate the effort the devs put into making some witty and authentic dialogue. The voice-acting and dialogue in general are exceptional, there is really nothing to complain there. The characters are fleshed-out enough for you to remember them and their voices for quite a while…  and get emotionally involved when they get horribly murdered in great numbers .Graphics/sound design: The buffed looks of the Definitive Edition are definitely an eye-catcher; especially the cut-scenes look really impressive with good character models and animation even in close-up shots. Animations are smooth in general, which is important due to the prevalence of combo-based melee combat and the cover-shooter mechanics. Texture quality is good I guess, nothing exceptional here, but it’s an open-world game so I wouldn’t expect them to put HD textures on everything. The weather effects are kinda nice; driving around in grey, rainy Hong Kong is pretty dank I gotta say. Sound effects are nothing special, the fact that you have a pretty large array of radio tunes on a number of different channels when driving is a neat idea though, there’s some great songs there that would instantly remind me of the streets of Hong Kong every time I hear them again.Mechanics: There’s a lot of different stuff to do in Sleeping Dogs, really a lot, there’s just not a huge amount of depth to it. The plethora of fighting techniques and minigames was just wide and deep enough to not have me bored by the time I had finished the game though. So I guess it’s not a negative point, but also not a huge plus. You can hack cameras, pick locks, take photos of your one-night-stands, beat up bad guys with a myriad of combos, shoot at the tires of your chasers while driving, hijack cars at full speed on the highway (this is very cool believe me), win street races, play with your smartphone, trace phone call signals, crack open locked boxes, buy smart-looking clothes (you can even buy a fedora, I had a very euphoric moment there), speed around the sea in muthafugging boats, BOAT RACES, sing karaoke (and purposefully mess up to complete a sidequest), perform environmental kills (who doesn’t want to put their opponent’s head in a running circular saw?), get chased by the police, and probably a lot more I can’t remember at this point; so yeah, pretty damn diverse. The combat may seem very difficult at the beginning (it did to me because I am a retard and never play combo-based fighting games), but it gets incredibly easy once you get the hang of it. Character customization is alright, there’s two “progression trees” you can develop: Cops and Triads, that award you with points depending on how well you did in every mission (you get less cops points if you kill innocent civilians for example), the fighting combos are gained by returning statues to your melee trainer found throughout the main game.Performance: Ferry goot in all regards. I think I had the occasional crash but it wasn’t too bothersome, Steam overlay also didn’t work first for some reason. Other than that mostly 60fps on max settings on a 7950/7970 CFX and a 4770k, nothing to complain there.Should you play this game? Yes, the story is thrilling and thought-out enough for you to make it a worthwhile experience. The Chinese setting is a big plus for everyone into a completely different cultural context. Sleeping Dog’s Hong Kong has a unique feel and character to it, that’s for sure. There’s plenty enough variety in mechanics for you not to get bored in these ~25 hours of gameplay the game has to offer. It’s also pretty to look at. It’s a well-executed triple-A title overall, buy it discounted like I did and you won’t regret your purchase.  "

												My best friend introduced me to this game, and it quickly became one of my favorites. It tackles two odd tropes: being a cop, and being a cop in Hong Kong. The Asian world is often overlooked as a setting for open-world games, and Sleeping Dogs highlights what a massive mistake it is. Bright neon lights shine overhead as you drive through crowded streets, vendors and tourists plague the sidewalks, and an uncanny mixmatch of colors swirl together to give a strange contrast to the grey and brown of, say, Grand Theft Auto's cities. The game world is, admittedly, a bit too crowded at times, and some textures don't hold up all that well, even in the Definitive Edition, but, when you race along the pavement in the glistening storm, with the life of a city brimming up around you, it's an experience unmatched in its genre. The gameplay is mostly divided into two branches: Triad and Officer. Officer gameplay is most centered around protecting civilians, solving cases through side quests, and generally tackling things in a non-violent fashion. Triad gameplay is a martial arts cousin of the Batman Arkham franchise, with an attack button and a counter button taking up most of your combat controls, with some melee weapons and firearms sprinkled in. You're rewarded with EXP for violent acts, such as environmental takedowns, where you shove someone into a doorway and slam the door on their head, or toss them into a fan and watch their brains become a mess of pink textures and glimmering blood. These are *NOT* morality systems. You're not encouraged to choose one or the other, but rather to balance them both, which is a relieving break from the ""MAKE YOUR CHOICE"" design philosophy that sank the seventh generation. The story is nothing to write home about, but it is intriguing and well-presented. If nothing else, it does an excellent job of mimicking the stress an undercover position would place on an officer, and the conflict of loyalty and respect that would come with it. Wei Shen is a likable protagonist, and he only grows more endearing throughout the game, just like Winston and several of his Triad compatriots, and Raymond and his fellow police officers. There's a stark duality here that is thankfully ignorant of the player's wishes as a deciding factor. You *do not* choose the ending. The ending is prewritten, and it's well-written, which is more than I can say for several player-determinant stories.I can't recommend this game enough. If you enjoy other crime-centric open-world titles, such as Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row, and want to try something new, you'll find it in Sleeping Dogs. It's odd and charming all at once, with a thick layer of polish to keep it running with its heart shining through. It's clear the people who developed this game cared about making a good game, and I think that's all that really needs to be said.			"

												Oh my god...This game is so awesome that I can't write a review without cantonese slang.. lol :D. Really realistic enough for a game.His counter moves in a fight and everything is so realistic I would say, being a police and doing all the thug life stuff is really cool... I've been playing two days straight for 5~6 hours + each day, done with half of the game though not everything I do is on the main mission line (green). Its awesome and its 100% worth it. I paid 10$ for this originally costing 30$ game. I only feel sad for one part, i.e the day after I bought it for 10$, it went for 75% summer sale to 2.5$, so all I can say is grab it, those of you who can.PS: Mac users: works perfectly fine.

												Best anti-gamedesign pattern tutorial there on the market.Everything is just auwful: the vehicles physics is bad (sometimes your motorcycle behaves yourself well when making a full-speed turn, and the other moment it's not), fighting system is bad (sometimes counter button works and sometimes it's not), the openworld is empty with bad level design (you go for a marker on your mini-map. you see a couple of doors, one is usually locked, the other one leads you to an empty box-shaped room located, like, DIRECTLY BENEATH the marker, so then you realize that you should look for a way around the building).The licenced music sometimes can be fine, though, and graphics looks somewhat nice (with a strange FOW and LOD that, of cource, you cannot change there) despite the two-year old release date.

												An outstanding open-world game with plenty of audio bonuses to bilingual speakers. Fun combat, plenty of optional collectibles, and an engaging story. Easily over $20 of entertainment now, especially with all the DLC. Stock campaign is about as serious as GTA, but the DLC expansions take it to Saints-Row level debauchery.

												One day this game went on to Xbox Live for a free game with gold so I decided to get it. It was the original version and this one hadn't come out yet. I loved the game so much, and it was my favorite game. Sadly, my Xbox broke for unknown reasons and I was unable to play the game for a while. Then one day i see that this new and improved version of Sleeping Dogs has been released, and by then I had purchased a gaming PC so I was very exited when I found out I would be able to play Sleeping Dogs once again.I bought this, downloaded it, and played it. I spent 15 hours playing it on my first day of owning it. Now, the Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition goes through various improvements from the previous version. I will now go step by step describing them.Graphical Stuff: 9/10The trailer boasts about graphical and texture improvements, and they weren't lying. There aren't much improvements to the graphics as there are to the textures. Lighting is very clearly improved and clothing and hair are no longer static. There is a few minor glitches to this kind of things but nothing too noticeable.Audio: 5/10I personally cant see much difference.Gameplay: 8/10Sleeping Dogs: DE has a few changes to the gameplay. For example, the city of Hong Kong feels much more immersive, there is more pedestrians and traffic making Hong Kong feel more like Hong Kong. The driving mechanics feel much smoother and better. But now for cons. some of the walking controls feel very wonky and sometimes it is more difficult to actually do the parkour in the game. The game is also no longer able to generate everything in your general area, so sometimes you'll take a few step and all of a sudden the game will span a group of civilians right next to Wei. and sometimes people spawn in the sky and fall to Earth. but overall, really good gameplay. SPOILERS FROM HERE ON! I love this game so much, the story is amazing and there is so much attachment to characters. I felt bad for Mrs. Chu when Winston died at his wedding, and cried when Wei found Jackie Ma's dead body. When you find that Pendrew was a bad guy I was shocked. So much happens within this game and I hope to never stop playing itThat's why my final rating for this game is 9/10.───────────────────████───────────────────█████───────────────────██████───────────────────███████──────────────────████████──────────────────████████─────────────────█████████────────────────█████████───────────────█████████──────────────█████████──────────────██████████████████────────────█████████████████████───────────███████████████████████████████─██████████████████████████████████─███████████████████████████████████─█████Recommended█████████████████████─████████████████████████████████████─████████████████████████████████████─████████████████████████████████████─███████████████████████████████████─██████████████████████████████████─█████████████████████████████████─████████████████████████████████─███████████████████████			"

If you unlock most of the skill, you will find melee is quite interesting (it is a bit hard to start). The graphic of Hong Kong is quite real, just have to bend the real world to suit the game. Personally i am from HK and if you know Cantonese it is quite fun to hear the foul language the game used.			"

												I liked this one a lot. It played like GTA IV and the story was well done I thought. Two things I didnt like at all: the first was how the whole thing seemed to lag when you would make Shen start running. However this could just be because of the machine I ran it on. The second was that even in GTA your character can jump. You cant jump in Sleeping Dogs. This would really get annoying if your car trapped you in a spot and the character cant jump over a bloody foot high step. Past that though I think Square Enix did a capital job on Sleeping Dogs. I have not played through the Nightmare or Year of the Snake stories yet so we shall see if my opinion changes or stays the same.			"

It's very visually pretty, and it's a great PC port.It's also, without a doubt, the best car-fu simulator on the market.

												Game runs wonderfully on a 2013 MBP w/ GT750M 2gb. I am really enjoying this game, especially the collectables. The devs handled this aspect of the game nicely, as you can see on your minimap where items are that you have already collected. The fighting mechanics are great and gunplay is pretty fun. There is a decent variety of missions thus far.The biggest downside is the camera angle during driving. It is super frustrating to try and move the camera while driving, so it best left alone. Also, the definitive edition includes tons of great DLC, but you can acess game changing content (legendary costumes) super early in the game. Nothing that should deter anyone from getting the game, especially if you grab it on sale!			"

												Sleeping Dogs is probably one of my favourite games of all time. A compelling main storyline (even if its a linear narrative) and the values somehow resonate very strongly with me as well. Maybe its cos I have that Eastern upbringing lol. Uncle Po once said: ""Loyalty. Discretion. That's the attitude that makes us strong. ""  yes i know that wasnt the exact phrase but sounds better as quote like this. heh.  Pros 1. Fight mechanicsMelee Combat makes you feel like a real bad♥♥♥♥♥ Style all over them other street thugs. Pity you essentially are immortal mid-game through. Personally some scaling would have been great - and %tage chance for enemies to dodge rather than flat 'class' mechanics. So like skinnies and musclies can be like those monks sometimes so they can counter/dodge your moves on occasion. Nothing special for the gunfights - maybe an option to turn off that aim assist - sometimes its more a hindrance than a help haha. Gotta remember that this is not a gun game though.2. PlotI alr mentioned it above. BUT I COULD NOT STOP FIRST TIME THROUGH AND JUST PLAYED THE WHOLE GAME IN ONE SITTING. Entertainment aside, there's a real element for reflective thinking of our societies as you play and I appreciate that greatly on top of the fantastic story.  NUUU JACKIIEE WHYYY. RIP. 3. World BuildingSleeping Dogs HK is a pretty place. Walking around and listen to those NPCs conversations is hilarious - an example would be that mother daughter duo outside your flat at North Point. I laughed so hard. Also all those random events. Its the little things that make the world so much more colourful. 4. If you're a true ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..Run people over and over and then go to the hospital and listen to the nurse. Go punch hapless civilians on the street. Get the Wheels of Fury DLC and shoot up the place. Yeah. It's a free world out there my friend. Cons Too bad the game wasn't completed before being sold off to Enix by ffing Activision. There's some real potential that could have made this game so much more.1. Incomplete 'Loose Ends'You'll find some aspects of the game missing like bits in between and sometimes more than a little off. I can only suspect that the romance parts of the game was never really completed before the hand-off so Enix just tied it together real fast and left it as it currently stands. You can tell from how the first few romantic options are so much more thought out than the others - and even then there seemed to be a major timeskip in between dates.More minor loose ends are like things that are said to exist that don't - ""police scanner in your apartment unlocked""; 'Lady Killer' clothing set effect. Little things like that.2. Hardcore racer/driver people might get triggeredDriving is not the most realistic.. you could suffer from some clipping issues on certain sections of road that sends your vehicle (especially them motorcycles haha) on some spectacular aerobatics. 3. Lack of replayabilitySure i've restarted and played through the mainplot multiple times but after that's completed...there's not much to do. I would have liked to seen maybe either choosing to become a Cop or a Triad gangster and have some radiant quests to fit along with those lines. Maybe have those Cop Jobs added as DLC to be radiant quests. There are already a number of 'triad' quests outside of the main storyline. MAke those radiant. Also maybe have like extorting protection money from vendors and actual thing. Like you could have a bunch of thugs sometimes try to spawn in maybe K-Club or Club Bam Bam or the night market and you'd have to clear them out. 4. No Mod SupportYou know all that I said in point 3. Yeah. It could have happened. In Summary For a technically incomplete game, it's pretty damn good. All the cons I mentioned are really just finer details that could have fleshed out this universe even more. The core game is already there - and its fantastic. It's like Shadow of Mordor with a proper plot and Mafia 3 with exciting gameplay. :p 10/10 would buy againPS:  buy while on sale for maximum value  "

												Okay so from the perspective of someone of Chinese descent from Hong Kong, I have got to say they nailed a lot of the authenticity in the language side. The various random npc converstations is very similar to what I would hear around chinatowns and family gatherings though some of the cutscene conversations where it's English but then throwing in random Cantonese swearing in the middle of it is very unappealing and unauthentic. If anything it's more likely to go the other way around. There were a few iffy translations and various things that are a bit hard to translate directly to English.  Gameplay-wise, I am impressed with the driving, its better than what I expected from an open world game that doesn't mainly focus on the driving. It's obviously not the best but it serves it purpose and still is enjoyable. The melee focused combat is relatively good though a bit straining on long sessions. Gunplay is actually pretty good despite the focus being held on melee combat. Storyline was pretty fun and something that can keep you going. Many moments similar to some of those Hong Kong action films you may have seen before.			"

												Press e, you counterattackPress e, you loseI commend this because I want everyone going mad playing this game, combat trying to be cool, but for me it's♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can't kick enemy while they are trying to get up, even more boss character. you press e like hell when counterattack indicator up and you still get hit, when the boss attack almost land you press e you still get hit, early press you still get hit. I don't know if I want to pick up and play this game anymore.I'm thinking Assassin's Creed 1 counter attack mechanic is more plausible than this one now.			"

												Here's the short and sweet. This is Sleeping dogs, with Nightmare and Snake DLC. It also has a minor visual upgrade *better lighting is very noticeable*. Definitive edition? Strongly disagree with that statement however. All the DLC for the original edition is *not* included in this, I would honestly pick up the original over this. I have also noticed a performance difference in benchmarking, this may be due to the new textures, but if it's worth it will be up to you. I would look at some game play of both to make your decision on visual improvement VS performance hit. I will be continuing to play through this, only because I enjoyed it the first time. I own both, but recommend that first time buyers buy the original + all DLC if you want to *play* in the world, if you just want to grab the game and beat it, don't care about anything else...get this, on sale.

												Definitely get this game if you've never tried it! I LOVED every second of it. The driving is a bit odd but pretty fun because you can ram cars, the combat is amazing(however you don't use guns often), the story just made me want to keep playing it, and the graphics are amazing! I definitely am satisfied with picking up this game in a sale for $7.50 and with that price the game offers lots and lots of content for that price.Overall I rate the game a 9.5/10!			"

												I liked this one a lot. It played like GTA IV and the story was well done I thought. Two things I didnt like at all: the first was how the whole thing seemed to lag when you would make Shen start running. However this could just be because of the machine I ran it on. The second was that even in GTA your character can jump. You cant jump in Sleeping Dogs. This would really get annoying if your car trapped you in a spot and the character cant jump over a bloody foot high step. Past that though I think Square Enix did a capital job on Sleeping Dogs. I have not played through the Nightmare or Year of the Snake stories yet so we shall see if my opinion changes or stays the same.			"

												TL;DR This is a very fun game that is worth full price for the amount of gameplay you get out of it.Pros:+ Creative fighting style that is much more heavily focused on hand-to-hand combat over firearms+ Nice graphics+ Lots of missions/races to complete+ Engaging plotCons:+ Repetitive missions+ Very Limited soundtrack+ Driving is not the most fluid, though not terrible+ Money is too easy to makeSleeping Dogs is a fun game. Not a great game or a bad game, just plainly fun. I was not blown away by anything in particular about it, but I also didn't really hate anything about it, I just had fun. (what more could you ask for?) I mentioned above that I think full price is fair, but for full disclosure I got this game on sale for $7.			"

												Well, I really loved this game because I like to play Triad based game like this one. I like to play it in Hong Kong and alot of fun stuff to do. But it can be painful if you want to get 100% Achievement, you might want to play all of its DLC for 100% Achievement itself and more DLC for like 8 more Achievement or so. I'd highly recommended this game because it is fun and storyline is kinda awesome. I love that gameplay style with mixed of hand to hand fighting, melee weapon fightning, and of course, there guns too! Racing, Cop Jobs, hacking security camera, gambling on cockfighting, and many more to do there that you'll be a guaranteed fun for you! Also, another reason why I like it because I'm a Square Enix fan like this as well as Hitman, Just Cause, Deus Ex, Final Fantasy, etc.			"

												The game that settled for good enough when it could have been timeless.The voice acting should have been better because these characters are actually well thought-out and memorable. The police-gangster diachotomy is such a great concept, but could have been more high stakes. The driving mechanics are almost fantastic. I could do this with nearly every facet of the game.That said, it does a lot very well (and with the obvious comparison of this being Bruce Lee GTA, that should carry weight). Worth beating the main story line for sure.***There is an incredibly irritating technical issue I can't seem to fix - when the camera moves AT ALL during gameplay, an abberant horizontal line that looks like tearing cloud up what is otherwise a great looking game. Be prepared for this.			"

												I loved Sleeping Dogs begining to end, with it's great radio soundtrack, interesting story and characters, amazing fighting mechanics which will actually keep you from button mashing, and it's atmospheric and immersive world. A game like this will really make you wish it was first person.Now, on with the ratings.Story: 8.25 / 10You play as undercover cop Wei Shen, working with the Hong Kong Police Department to bring down triad gangs in Hong Kong upon moving back to the city after living in the United States.Characters: 9 / 10I felt the characters were unique and amazing in their own way.Missions: 7.5 / 10Although the main story missions were somewhat cliched and mostly combat-oriented, I did have fun with them. The activities are quite lacking, but the side missions are very enjoyable.Soundtrack: 8 / 10The radio stations have extremely good music compared to other games like GTA. In addition, the oriental-style OST added to the immersion factor.Combat: 9 / 10The combos prevent button mashing while keeping it interesting. Fighting is very fluid, and shooting is solid. Weapons can be picked up, and the environment around you can be used to defeat your enemies in entertaining and enjoyable ways. Also, as small of a feature as it is, the blood forming on combatants and inanimate objects give the feeling that you're really doing something.World: 9.75 / 10This is probably the best world I've seen in an open world game comparable to GTA and others. The city sounds, small alleyways, street vendors, city lights, bystanders, and beautiful weather bring this area together in a living, immersive, atmospheric, awesome world. My only complaint is that there aren't many areas with nature, and instead the world is 95% city.Overall: 52 points out of 60. A must buy for those who love any of the following: PORK BUNS, open world games, fighting games, crime games, and of course, the amazing PORK BUN. All hail PORK BUN.			"

												Sleeping Doge is an open world action-adventure game similar to GTA. It deals with the life an undercover cop by the name of Wei Shen who is given the task of investigating a Triad group called the Sun On Yee. Pros: -Good Story.-Good Music.-Good Voice Acting.-Fun combat system.-Improved Graphics.-Definitive Edition Includes DLCs.-Simple and fluid gameplay.Cons?: -No real end game content.-Missions are repetitive.-Driving is not fun. Ramming however, is hilarious.Overall, Sleeping Dogs is a solid game that is fun similar to other games of the genre. What sets it apart from the others is its story and braindead, yet fun combat system. I highly recommend it, especially if you can get it in a sale. This game is literally what Shenmue 3 should be like.			"

												One of the best single player games I played. (I know I wrote it several times but meh, I'm what french people call an eternal dissatisfied man, so when I love a game I have to recommend it!)First, playing in Asia is uncommon enough to be noticed. The environment makes you travel and the moments when you see Honkong by night, with its lights reflected on the wet roads are intense and unforgettable.In addition, as an eternal dissatisfied player, I often uninstall a game when I feel that I'm not not free of my movements enough. This is what I loved in the game: the Parkour influences in Sleeping Dogs delighted me.And it's the same for the fights. As a martial arts practicer, I hate when I fight scene isn't realistic. Here, you learn real boxing and kung-fu moves. The weapons are quite rare, which makes you fight your enemies with your bare hands.But, the thing that spoiled the gameplay is the driving levels. You have to drive a lot for your missions and it's so hard to handle the cars.The scenario is maybe the best part. It's really simple but effective: you're an undercover cop who must infiltrate a dangerous gang. So you have two personalities and two kinds of opposed missions. Your character will have affection for some members of your gang (no spoil). The only improvement the game could have is a choice system like in Mass Effect to impact your story. But even if you don't really make choices, your character's are always legit and don't really stop your immersion.Do I recommend it? YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.9.25/10			"

Load times are acceptable and menus are easy enough to navigate.You certainly won’t find it ""a beautiful game"", but it looks nice. It’s too bad that there are some texture loading issues and a poor draw distance, though.Camera angles can get wonked-out while fighting and especially while driving. But melee combat and gunplay alike are still a lot of fun, and the driving is generally sublime.			"

												Played the original for a decent amount of time,finished it,loved it,aaaaand forgot all about it really soon.The only redeeming bit about about the game,that's far from forgettable,was the Nightmare DLC(Which i promptly refused to buy).Fast forward a few years,and i regret not playing it earlier.Also,Sleeping Dogs+Upscaled Textures+DLCs+Edge is a pretty solid 7/10.

												WOW A GTA STYLE OPEN WORLD GAME THAT TAKES PLACE IN HONG KONG DAMNNN.This was one of my favorite games, with great remastered graphics that have improved it so much from the original. Its cringey cantonese voice acting is extremely awkward and hilariouse since I can understand every swear word they say... because thats the only words they ever say in cantonese. The map of Hong Kong may not be too big but its still pretty acurate. You get to play as a undercover cop who steals cars and finds out that there is more conflicts than having to just take down or cripple 2 of Hong Kong's Triad Gangs... The Sun on Yee and the 18KYOU CAN'T CALL YOURSELF A MAN WITHOUT TRYING OUT SOME PORK BUNS!PS heres a SPOILER from Transformers 4 that may be a sleeping dogs easter egg:  When KSI runs away with his secretary in Hong Kong, they will get cornered and have a fight in an elevator with an Asian guy watching. That Asian guy then drops hes stuff and helps fight KSI's enemies.  COULD THAT ASIAN GUY BE WEI SHEN????? WHO KNOWS?? ITS YOUR OPINION Heres the evidence: https://youtu.be/XioF_iXswhI?t=1m43sToo bad there won't be a sleeping dogs 2 since United Front Games company was closed down due to bankruptcy but hey, atleast they actually tried to work on sleeping dogs 2 before they shut down....

Combat, parkour, plot and characters all work so well, and best of all, work well together. While there are flaws in individual parts of Sleeping Dogs, they combine to be something mucher greater than the sum of their parts. Absolutely make sure you play this. And eat a pork bun.			"

												A game that should have received a sequel, SD brings players into a vibrant Hong Kong, eschewing guns for a visceral hand-to-hand combat system. It's big, it's flashy, it has great music and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Whenever I miss HK I just need to fire up SD to re-capture the feeling. I do hope the developers get picked up by other studios, they showed their talent with this game.			"

												I never really got into GTA, but man do I love this game.Things I really enjoy:- Just driving around Hong Kong, listening to Cantonese Rap or the Warp and Ninja Tune Radio channels (playing Autechre, Bonobo, Hudson Mohawke and lots of other good stuff)- Gripping story, makes you care about the people around you- Good fighting mechanics including finishing your enemies using your environment (altough I wish it was slightly more sophisticated and countering less powerful)- A good variety of missions! (Even though all you can do is drive, shoot, punch people and take pictures, the missions are pretty diverse. You can do cop, triad and neutral missions, including: fight clubs, underground races, drug busting and lots more.)Really good game, I got it for less than 10USD and can only recommend it! "

												This game is great! The story gets a bit confusing at time but it's still pretty good. Cars can be a bit wonky to control but once you get the hang of it, its not that bad (it's much better with a controller). I wish more of the dialogue was in Cantonese (with subs obviously) since you ARE in Hong Kong, but that's just a minor problem. It's a shame that the studio that made the game shut down.			"

												After recalibrating my Life I've now decided I want to live in Hong Kong. I have mastered Martial Arts and Am now moving on to impressing The Beautiful Hong kong Women. Only problem is Am not sure whats more rewarding arresting a Drug pusher or beating up inocent bystanders and senior citizens. Its the story of my Life and I can't stop playing...The graphics are amazing, The realism is really captivating just when you think you've seen it all, it rains and you open up your umbrlla. Honestly, if The cars were alittle more detailed and responsive, This game would definately be Alot better than any of the Grand Theft Auto series.As far as Story line and playablity..its still a complete 10. The fighting sequences are amazing. Theres nothing more rewarding than putting a Bad guys Head thru a glass table or into a wall, These are things that Grand Theft does not do as well..rewarding battles and a very challenging story line..you feel like your not just playing a game your accomplishing goals all the time. Amazing!!Again another area Grand Theft doesn't handle as well...rewards. This Game is very rewarding. Your given new outfits, New Fighting Combo's, new vehicals, lets just say This Game will not leave you unrewarded!  Its a statement that no other game has matched since its release...funnny thing these guys did all this before Theft V... Great-Amazing-Beautifully Done.. would recommend to anyone who owns a joystick. What a blast. Thanks Steam for another great recommendation. A classic tribute to game developers and a true Gift to Gamers. Love IT.			"

												This game is great. The combat system is fantastic and it's an open world so there's plenty of possibilities. A vital tip is that you should get the full ""Mountain Triad Clothing Set"" asap because with the 15% bonus exp you should be able to get all 10 upgrades by the end game. Triad exp, is really only viable through the main story quest line, whereas cop exp can be gained through a ton of side stuff. I'm currently playing through again because I fell short at 9 nine triad upgrades last play through.			"

												Not sure what it is that grabs me about this game, but I really enjoy it. Played through fully on Xbox 360 when it first came out, Xbox One, and now PC. The combat system is pretty good, but in all honesty, you can finish the melee side of the game by mashing the X button and kicking everyone to death.Although it's enjoyable, it's not without it's bugs and annoyances, the main one for me being the world's worst parcour running. One minute you can run up a wall to grab a ledge, the next you can't jump over a waist high fence! I kept experiencing audio loops too, where a gunshot or explosion sound would loop until I exited the game.Expansion wise, the nightmare DLC is pretty lame, and can be rattled off in about an hour and is very repetative. Don't go expecting anything on par with Red Dead Redemption's nightmare expansion. Zodiac Island (Enter the Dragon) is pretty cool, but again just over an hour. Year of the Dragon is pretty good too. Much of the other DLC was inventory items, collections, tweaks, etc.All in all, I'd definately recommend buying this if you've never played it. For my money it beats the whole GTA series in to the ground, then special moves it into the wood chipper!			"

												This game is flat out awesome and one of th best open world with story games I've ever played. Graphics are decent for it's age, the voice acting is great, the combat is varied and tricky at times and while the hand to hand portion is not dificult it is very satisifying espeically once you unlock some of the hard hitting moves. The story is immersive and while predictable at times is still fun to play out and watch.Also the majoritity of the DLCs (which are included with this version) are good and fun to play. In short this game is worth a full price purchase and if you can find it on sale for 50% or more there is no reason not to snag this game cause it will be worth every cent.And if all that isn't good enough you get ot play as a character named Wei Shen who does bare a slight resemblance to and likely inspired slighty by the Big Trouble in Litttle China character of the same name!

												Saw this game and knew I had to buy it. I mean, who could resist an open world game that Square Enix put their name on (as publisher, but still). Especially if it's the edition that contains all the dlc. I bought it and was not disappointed, it had a great story that also managed to not get in the way of the free-roam that made up probably over half my playtime so far.I couldn't say anything bad about it except that if you have a weaker computer like me, the game can act sluggish. That said though, even my dinosaur can get the game running well most the time, so it likely won't be a problem for anyone with an even half decent computer :D			"

												Worked great two days ago.. on extreme setting at 60 fps. Played it today had like 6 fps on extreme don't know why tf it decreased. Didn't change anything. Now I have to decrease it to low setting and even then I only get 20 to 30 fps.  I heard this was a problem with the original sleeping dogs but I would think the remastered would solve these issues.EDIT: Looks like the mistake was on my end.  With that said I do recommend this game.  Fun Story, good character and and overall fun experience.  Gotta say though my favorite thing to do is jump on a motorcycle with the cops chasing me and drive full speed toward an oncoming car and just before hitting it, pop and wheelie and use the car as a ramp.

tl;dr: Sleeping Dogs is a superb open world action game that will make you feel like the star of a kung fu movie.Sleeping Dogs is one of my favorite open world games ever, I played it so much when it originally released and I was surprised how great the game actually was. All of the environments in Definitive Edition look beautiful especially when running on higher settings. The gun combat isn't bad but it's not really anything special, where Sleeping Dogs really shines is with the hand to hand combat. The fighting mechanics feel great and throughout the game you learn new fighting techniques to add to your arsenal. There are also several different environment takedowns you can preform that are brutal as they are awesome. Sleeping Dogs also allows you to free run and preform stunts all over Hong Kong. Where Sleeping Dogs took me by surprise the most is its story. In Sleeping Dogs you play as Wei Shen, a undercover cop tasked to infiltrate the Triads. The story is well written and all of the characters are intriguing. The story takes lots of twists and turns, is mostly action packed, and makes it harder for Wei to decide if he is more of a cop or more of a Triad as it progresses. Wei Shen is a fantastic protagonist, he is just a truely bad♥♥♥♥♥character, one of my favorite video game protagonists of all time for sure. While I'm at it I might as well say that all of the other main characters are great and well voiced too. There is always something to do in Sleeping Dogs; you can go do a mission for the Triads, do a police mission, help a stranger in need, participate in a race, participate in a fighting tournament, bet on a♥♥♥♥♥♥fight, go on a date, take out rival gangs, learn new fighting moves from the dojo, explore the world to find lock boxes, plus lots more and everything else you could expect from a open world sandbox action game. So in closing, Sleeping Dogs is a amazing game filled with action, narrative, and variety that I highly recommend to anyone who is even just a little interested in the game, it should pleasantly surprise you as it did to me. Sleeping Dogs is a hidden gem among open world games and one of the best open world games I have ever played.			"

												It's a great game, IMHO better than GTA V. After playing countless hours of the xbox version, I bought the game via Steam, mostly for the portability of having it on my laptop. Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to like SOMETHING about my computer, as it crashes every ~15 minutes. Would still recommmend to others, I've done a lot of shady modification to this computer, which is likely the cause of the issues. Or it could be Win10 again, who knows.9/10, Great game. It has pork buns.EDIT: If on Windows 10, go to Services and disable ""Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service""			"

												A remastered version of what was already one of the best looking games of the last generation; Sleepy Dawgs: Deffo Edtion takes the gameplay you know and love and just gives it a little tweak before handing it back to you, just about the same. All the DLC is there but don't expect it to be handed to you. All Cosmetic DLC has been folded into the base game organically and unlocked through new mission types and other activities, which i think is pretty cool. If you liked Sleeping Dogs and want to experience it again, this is literally the DEFINITIVE way to do that.			"

												Having played the original 'Sleeping Dogs', I love this game to death. It's right up there next to Saints Row 2 when it comes to best GTA Clone. The reason being is because it nails down that atmosphere and the action just feels good. It has a nice story of Hong Kong Police vs The Triads in which you go undercover and infiltrate as much as possible. Really nails down that Hong Kong atmosphere and gets to the nitty gritty with the Martial Arts combat that I am in love with as I truly have a passion for Martial Arts. There is some gunplay as well that adds really nice action sequences. A lengthy game and loads of content makes this game an absolute purchase when its on sale or even in full price! I say its worth it!			"

												The plot of the game was amazing to me. It was worth it to get the definitive edition because it looked awesome while providing a story that pretty much blew my mind and I could not predict what came next. The combat was cool but took takes time to get used to and what you can do in open world amazes me because I can buy pork buns off the street from some random dude. I really love the twist the the main story as well because it comes from getting good to all going to♥♥♥♥♥♥but then things started getting slightly into position with sacrifices made. The only thing I would complain about were the dlcs that takes place like after the main story. Those were basically side quests set off into a different type of time period. They are just seperate which kind of makes me go meh. I really love the environmental kills you can do because they can be pretty brutal and make combat slightly easier. For guns I get how in the plot it makes sense that you cannot just wave around a gun willy nilly. I really wished they made this game like a good guy or a bad guy where you decide if you are Triad or Cop with Wei because that would've been awesome and to see a difference in events I definitely would have replayed it.

												People are always comparing this to GTA, saying it's the Asian version of the game. Personally, I really think that the storyline is better than GTA, it has better mechanics and it isn't too highly demanding. The only issue I ran into while playing this game is when it would launch into a black screen, but thats an easy fix. If I were to rate this game out of ten, I would give it a 9. Highly reccomended to those who like open world and GTA style games.			"

												This game is a cross between GTA and Watchdogs and I'll give you one guess as to if I like it better. The fact that you get to play from a cops point of view is great, I honestly wish that there were more games that were like this. Often times when playing this game on my first playthrough I found myself going ""aw♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is it. This is where Wei gets whacked."" The game is intense enough to keep you wanting to move through the storyline and even afterwards, the umber of side quests you have is astounding.Where both GTA and Watchdogs lacked, this game takes those aspects and runs with them. Hacking makes more sense in this game than it did in watchdogs, and the storyline is way more engaging in my opinion. The story actually made sense and what you do was for a reason unlike GTA where you go shoot people for no reason (although if you'd like to do just that you can). I also felt like Wei was relatable and easy to feel bad/good/whatever for unlike a majority of the GTA characters as well.Driving in this game is probably my favorite aspect, as you have achievements unlocked while driving for doing certain actions and that always kept me striving not to cut a corner too sharp or to hit a random person who walked out into the street.

The fact that guns are rare and don't have such a big role in the game is a breath of fresh air from games like GTA or other sand boxes with lots of guns. Driving is hella fun. Characters are memorable and the atmosphere is amazing. Wish you could do more hood rat stuff with Jackie. Wei Shen's on-going struggle with his identity is really amazing and it's something I can relate to. Minus the cop-gangster part. 9/10 sequel please			"

												One of my favourite open world game of all time. Pros :- The combat system is a lot of fun with those street fistfights. But BEWARE for you who love gunfights, you are not able to buy any gun freely. Guns in this game are only available through several special missions and legendary costume shops (when you bought some costumes like agent 47 costume, you will automatically equipped with a gun).- The parkour run in this game is just perfect. It makes the game more charming and gives you more variations to run away from cops or hostiles. - There are many cool vehicles and costumes to collect. I usually wear that Rico Rodriguez costume to spam those grenade launchers.- Badass main character, good voice actings, many memorable scenes & great story. - There are a lot of missions to complete and each mission is different from the others. The missions are not repetitive and makes me want to try them all (which I did).  - Destructable environment, normal for an open world like this.- You can develop your character by learning and upgrading his skills (cop skills, triad skills, melee fighting skills) and even his health bar. - Talking about skill, there's this skill that allows you to enter a slow motion mode similar to Max Payne 3. - Sometimes, we are a bit annoyed bt the fact that there's no vehicle nearby when we need it the most. Don't worry, there's a VALET PARK feature, but there's a special requirement for that. You can call your driver anytime (except during quest), anywhere (except if you are standing in places that unaccessable by cars or motorcycles) to deliver your vehicles to your exact location. Cons :- I'm not sure whether this is a cons or not. The amount of weapons in this game is a bit lacking, especially for guns. That's probably because this game's charm is the fistfights, not gunfights. The other explanation is there will be stated in the story that guns are rare in Hongkong. If we can access guns easily like in GTA or Saints Row, those martial art fighting skills will be useless. - If you equip a gun, you cannot interact with some NPCs like food selling NPCs or Parking NPCs because they are afraid of you. This is supported by the ""guns in Hongkong are rare"" logic. Oh, one more thing, if you equipped yourself with a weapon, and then you enter a mission, hoping that you can use that weapon in the mission, no you cannot. Your weapons will be disarmed automatically, so there's no point on keeping that weapon so long.- Melee weapons like knives, etc can broke in battle. You simply can't keep them for long in this game. Your fist is your loyal weapon. - Camera is a bit troublesome when driving, sometimes. Overall, this game gave me great experience and immersion. I feel like a total badass in this game. 9/10. Worth the price, worth your time. "

												Modern Review for an older game.I had recently picked this up and I had always wanted the game from when I was a consol peasent playing on a xbox 360. The games graphics arn't the greatest and I had experienced one glitch in a full 3 hours of gameplay so it has matured expectedly.The plot is very liear, keep that in mind. this isn't a do whatever rpg like skyrim.The last mention for this is that this game does everything all at once. I mean everything. you play as a cop who gets to bust drug deals, you get to race cars, you get to do gears of war shooting mechanics, you get platformer style fighting in a 3rd person enviorment. you get gta style open world car driving.it has alot of potential (note: Im saying this in late 2015) the concept was great I wish they could do a re make or a sequal to fix all the problems. because its too liear, they didn't focus enough on cars, they didn't make a proper shooting aspect that was noteable, they didnt't make the plot memorable. All of these things could be fixed in a sequal I wish they would make one because at its core I really like the game.			"

												This right here is an awesome game. This edition has all the DLC in it, but well implemented, in the sense that you won't get a huge dump of stuff at the start of the game, you'll have to earn it (some costumes have special effects, buffs and even different fighting styles).The story is solid. The fighting is so good you'll jump out of a moving car at the chance to beat up some guys.There are some downsides:- Rubber banding in the races.

												The definitive edition plays just as well, if not slightly better than the original, but what really sets this version apart from the already excellent vanilla edition is the fact that Hong Kong actually looks like Hong Kong this time. Many may prefer the slick neon, (and very Western) vision of Hong Kong from the original game, but the muted colours, haze, and lighting in the DE all help to present a Hong Kong that is much more faithful to that great city. If only the game offered more opportunities to beat up corrupt police and Beijing officials.. - 9/10			"

												Modern Review for an older game.I had recently picked this up and I had always wanted the game from when I was a consol peasent playing on a xbox 360. The games graphics arn't the greatest and I had experienced one glitch in a full 3 hours of gameplay so it has matured expectedly.The plot is very liear, keep that in mind. this isn't a do whatever rpg like skyrim.The last mention for this is that this game does everything all at once. I mean everything. you play as a cop who gets to bust drug deals, you get to race cars, you get to do gears of war shooting mechanics, you get platformer style fighting in a 3rd person enviorment. you get gta style open world car driving.it has alot of potential (note: Im saying this in late 2015) the concept was great I wish they could do a re make or a sequal to fix all the problems. because its too liear, they didn't focus enough on cars, they didn't make a proper shooting aspect that was noteable, they didnt't make the plot memorable. All of these things could be fixed in a sequal I wish they would make one because at its core I really like the game.			"

												This right here is an awesome game. This edition has all the DLC in it, but well implemented, in the sense that you won't get a huge dump of stuff at the start of the game, you'll have to earn it (some costumes have special effects, buffs and even different fighting styles).The story is solid. The fighting is so good you'll jump out of a moving car at the chance to beat up some guys.There are some downsides:- Rubber banding in the races. They are optional, but the last one with the rubber banding is pretty nuts- Guns. There shouldn't be any, you don't need them. Ok, they are rare and almost only in certain parts and scripted events.Would buy it again (I actually own the previous version on steam with the DLCs).On a side note, since my abbility to easily aquire Pork Buns in real life is almost nul (not part of my countries cozine) I ended up buying a steamer and making some myself.

												1. Nice graphics where hair is not bad at all! Music selection is great.2. Odd saving game sytem. You can save anywhere, but upon loading you'll spawn in your apartment.3. Outside of missions trashmobs are not hostile unless you come too close to them (or trigger an event). Some do respawn, but you can ignore them completely.4. During playthrough you get different XP points necessary to unlock skills. You'll get more than required of police XP and face XP, but Triad XP is superhard to get. Which goes to point #5…5. The game contains dressup barbie part, but most of ""rags"" have some bonus. Better damage, less vehicle prices, some include weapons, etc. But there is a certain set that gives +15% triad XP bonus. I did buy myself Jensen (yea, DX!) set but later switched to this ugly triad bonus crap - which is IMO a bad thing when you're ""forced"" to use something out of practical reasons and not because you like it. On the other hand this game isn't RPG so… Expecting to play DX role is a bit unrealistic.6. Just as in AC games, the openworld is filled with collectibles. With certain sidequests solved, these get shown on the map. Sadly, due to some bug not all are displayed on the map, but just on the minimap when you come close and you'll have to pixelhunt if you want to get them all. Similar applies on events, some are displayed on the map, some appear only on your minimap when you come close. Horrible design.7. Fasttravel doesn't exist. And you can't phone for a cab. However, you can pop in a car or something, drive a bit till you spot a taxi, block it's route, exit the car and hire that taxi to drive you somewhere instantly. This could have been designed better.8. Kung fu fights and shootouts are fun. There are no normal ones, some are supereasy, but some are superhard. For these hard ones, you'll need buffs (eat, drink, massage) and if necessary equip some damage reducing bonus equipment (super swat rags reduce damage 50%, to get these you just have to solve all police sidequests).9. The story is linear, nothing spectacular but still okay (you're undercover cop in Hong Kong) and I love the mixture of chinese/english in voiceovers! Subtitles are again halfarsed, dunno who's decision was to put them displayed with some supersmall font, will someone explain developers we don't use a microscope while playing games? Also it has some odd vanishing design, nothing great and nothing bad, basically nothing to brag about.10. The game does contain unskippable races, OMG. I'd spit on it right this moment, but…- tyres are not bald and roads are not icy- driving anything with K+M doesn't feel like being scammed by a publisher- all mandatory races are easy to win (you get hints on what to do)In other words, this game is not GTA annoyance nor GTA boredom!As you may suspect, I don't play optional races sidequests, nor will. No 100% the game, check my achievements where I'll probably have everything except Need4Speed rubbish done.-Sleeping Dogs is more of AC than GTA clone, here you won't be racing 90% of your precious playtime like in GTA and there is plenty of fun nonracing content to enjoy.It was on some sale, I paid 7.5€ for it, and that price is IMO a steal.If you planned to buy GTA5, do me a favor and buy Sleeping Dogs instead. It's a far better game.			"

												An excellent sandbox game, with fantastic atmosphere and feeling.Sleeping Dogs is a sandbox action-adventure game set in Hong Kong. You play as Wei Shen, a police officer sent on an undercover assignment to infiltrate the Triads. The story is great, with fantastic mission variety and stellar voice acting by a cast of well known Hollywood actors. Characters are developed pretty well, and you can really feel ther emotions. However, due to the nature of the story, it could have benefited more from a sort of ""trust"" system like Splinter Cell Double Agent had. Here, you are awarded Cop and Triad XP for different things you do during missions, and each unlock different upgrades for Wei. Also, the ending is kind of abrupt and comes out of nowhere, which was a bit disappointing, seeing as everything before that was great.The gameplay is pretty standard for a sandbox game, except there is far more emphasis on hand to hand combat and parcour. Fighting is simillar to Batman Arkham combat, with gadgets being replaced by a wide variety of combos, and brutal environmental finisher attacks. Also, there are sequences where you chase a target simillar to Assassin's Creed, with your character having similar parcour moves like wall climbing and such.Driving is also pretty standard, with the awesome addition of action hijacks, where you are capable of hijacking a vehicle from another vehicle, while driving. It always look awesome seeing Wei jump out of a moving car, onto another moving car, and jump in through the windows.Graphics are excellent, although the highest AA settings can be pretty demanding on the system. Even without them, the game still looks spectacular, escpecially at night when Hong Kong lights up. The town is beautifully rendered, and looks quite close to the real thing.The overall atmosphere is fantastic. The entire game feels like a AAA chinese cop action drama movie, and it is awesome. There is even a mission based on ""In Dragon's Lair"", which is played with an old movie filter over all the graphics, and Wei can even wear the famous Bruce Lee yellow jumpsuit.The music is also great, with a wide variety of stations available, from ones that play chinese music, to the ones with more traditional westerns songs.There are plenty of side missions and races, and there are lot of different types of those you can run into, meaning you can rarely get bored doing the same thing over and over again. The game also has lots of collectables and a relatively easy way to get them to show on the map, but revealing that would be a shame, since it is such a cool surprise.Overall, it is a fantastic game. Despite not having any replayability, the story itself and many different side missions mean you can spend quite a lot of time with the game and enjoy it. Definitely worth your time, I highly recommend it.			"

												Now that I've finished the game, I'm qualified to make a review on it. The game starts off with an awesome scene where you run away from the cops, you are captured and you are in jail with Jackie he then takes you to a fight area where you learn combat moves and more. The combat system is really similar to Rocksteady's Batman Arkham franchise in many ways. There are awesome car chases with guns, like when you capture Naz. The game features more things than Grand Theft Auto EX: Shooting while driving, Karaoke, Face Level, Cop Missions, Triad Missions, Door slam, and more! I really like the Defenitive Edition, I had the original one on Xbox 360 and I played it for hours and hours on end. I played this for days and days. The graphics are great on the next gen!			"

												You play as Wei Shen, an undercover police officer who's on a case of destabilizing the triad of Hong Kong.One could say it's GTA with a chinese flair.PROS:+ great story+ outstanding voice acting and fleshed out characters+ diverse and unique main and side missions+ the epic chicken fight(trust me, you'll understand once you get there)CONS:- the GPS is often going batshit crazy- the side missions can get a bit repetitive after a while- the freeruning in the city is an illusion, rendering HK a bit shallow explorationwiseGenerally, I dislike chinese settings in games and films.They simply don't click with me.Which is why Sleeping Dogs was such a nice surprise.The game is enjoyable, feels smooth, has its own character, presents the playerwith an awesome action-filled content.I could say that it lacks depth and replayability, but it's not a huge issue.You'll definitely have fun while it lasts.""Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand?""

												An excellent and particularly immersive open-world action game. I would call this the polar opposite of Saints Row. Saints Row is over-the-top, empowering, grandiose, and ridiculous. Sleeping Dogs seems to strive for immersion, (relatively) intelligent writing, a wealth of more fleshed-out activities, and solid voice acting.The immersion comes from a variety of things. For one, the voice work. A good portion of the dialogue is in Chinese (with English subtitles). However, it's mixed in with a majority of English dialogue, which does seem a bit out-of-place considering everything takes place in China. I wish that a greater majority of the game had been in Chinese, but it's still a good step towards making the world believable. Furthermore, unlike open world games where you quickly acquire a ridiculous arsenal of weaponry you can unleash on the hapless civilians, this game is more reserved. Much of the action takes place via hand-to-hand combat instead of shooting. Also, the game rewards you for driving well, which gives you more of a reason to ""play along"" (unlike games where you can level buildings and go on mass murering sprees with no consequences).Coming from Saints Row, I felt like the writing was a breath of fresh air. It's not spectacular, but it actually manages to make you care a bit about the characters, which is something I have rarely ever experienced in games like this.There's a big variety of activities that have pretty polished mechanics: fighting, karaoke, shooting, and racing. Each of these, while not quite as good as a game focused on those specific mechanics, manages to keep you from getting bored. The fighting is very simple but satisfying - you have one button for attacking, one for grabbing, and one for countering. I will say that it became very easy to win fights simply by waiting and countering, but the game at least encourages you to go for more stylistic combat by rewarding you with XP for doing special things during fights. I was surprised by the karaoke and while not much of a challenge, it gives a nice break from the more action-packed gameplay. The racing is also decent though certainly not realistic. You have a ""powerslide"" button that enables you to pull of cool looking maneuvers and quickly traverse through the city. However, there's a noticeable amount of ""rubberbanding"" (the game speeds up AI opponents when they are behind you and slows them down when in front of you) which makes you feel a little less satisfied when you win and a bit frustrated when you pull of a good maneuver only to have the AI right back on your tail. Finally, the shooting is also decent but nothing special. It's typical cover-based shooter mechanics. They try to change it up by adding a slow-mo effect when you are performing certain moves like vaulting over cover or shooting from a vehicle, which allows you to pull off cinematic action sequences without requiring too much skill or being frustrating.So, overall, I'd say this is really fun if you enjoy open world games. There's plenty of stuff to collect and side-missions to complete, so there's a good amount of replayability, but the main story is also a pretty good experience.			"

More on the serious and realistic side except for a particular DLC storyline which is separate from the main game. All the usual goodies you'd expect from an ""Urban Open World"" title, explore the vast colorful and diverse metropolis of Hong Kong where you can do gang or police related activities, race cars, go shopping, even date!

												I am a fan of open world action games so i think this game deliver that atmosphere very well. I only played definitive so i am not sure what they added the game but i can say it's pretty solid game. Unlike other series this game is heavily on hand to hand combat rather then guns or tools. Driving gets a little time to adapt. Combat is amazing. Missions and side missions are fun to play. Integrated dlc missions is also fun to play. For the story at first i didn't like the idea of being a undercover cop (thought they will restirct my actions) it didn't matter and the story development was pretty good. But i think they could give a better feeling about Wei's pressure about being undercover or never mention it. Despite all that Wei Shen is a true man and you know why because he eats pork bun..			"

												This game's story was easily one of the best stories I've played through to the very date.  Is this game perfect? No, but it sure is worth a shot. In the game, you are Wei Chen, an undercover cop with a troubled past. Now, in the present, Wei is charged with the task of infiltrating a triad in Hong Kong, the Sun On Yee. It is up to him to do what ever it takes to get them to trust him and for him to take down the Sun On Yee from the inside. The story is one of the greatest parts about this game, it deals with 'stockholm like' stuff and getting overly attached, it also blurs the clear cut line between what is right and wrong. The characters are also memorable and well written.   The gameplay is also another great thing about this game. The game is an open world game where you can drive cars or take taxes to your destinations. Driving around the city is pretty fun and the city is fairly large. Along with the main missions, there are other things to be done, such as go on dates, do favors for people, shop for clothes and food, buy cars, stop drug deals, steal cars, karaoke (Yes, karaoke), and do police cases. There are also collectible items and shires to collect/activate, which reward you (New fighting moves and health upgrades).   The fighting is another key factor in this game in which the creators take pride in. The fighting is similiar to the Batman Arkham series, but is different enough that it isn't copying it. As you go you, you learn more moves, which is extremely helpful at times to take down those annoying thugs. The fighting is martial arts based and can be very satisfying. There's also 'environmental take-downs', which allow you to shove someone into a fish tank, or close a door on someone's face, or even put them in an ice chopper (brutal!). There's also gunplay in this game that isn't really anything new, but is still fun. There is, however; a slow motion mechanic that is pretty cool. The driving isn't also anything that new, but the cars handle well, depending on the car, and it does have some pretty great driving mechanics.  The one problem that I had with the game is that a good majority of the buildings in the game were just shells. It really doesn't affect the gameplay that much, but it is still worth mentioning. Like many open world games, there are radio stations. The music provided in the game is pretty great and adds something special to long drives or even some chase scenes. The missions in the game are very fun, some are similiar but most feel different and are definitely worth the time to play through them (they aren't usually that long). Being that this version is the Definitive Edition, it also comes with the dlc, which adds some more story to do after the campaign. The dlc is definutely worth checking out too.  Overall, I had a blast playing through this and I look forward to coming back to in the near future. I personally got this game on sale, but I'd definitely buy it for its full retail price!  "

												7/10I put around 100 hours into the original Sleeping Dogs several years back on my old PC; on my new, much more powerful machine, I was thrilled to play the definitive edition. It's not merely a re-release - it's a reworking of the graphics and a slight improvement on the already fluid and fun combat system, and it contains additions to the campaign (extended narrative, extra cop side missions) that are worthy of the repurchase cost for fans who already have the original (specifically those who liked it and want to play it again). Because I had already finished the campaign as well as played through the DLC episodes, I was hesitant to buy the same game twice, but when it went on sale for $7.50, I struck and was very happy I did. This is not only an extended and much more immersive experience; it works better on newer software and hardware architecture. It manages to pack Hong Kong more densely with NPCs and greatly improve environmental textures and weather while demanding much less of my GPU than the original release. They both hit some of the same framerates, but with settings cranked, my video card chugs along very loudly to the original release while it's capable of rendering more with less power in the definitive edition. Truly an optimal redesign for the PC.For the many who've already played Sleeping Dogs and loved it, I 100% recommend picking up the definitive edition IF you want to play through the campaign again or if you haven't played the DLC episodes (and I'd wait for a sale). You may find the experience enjoyable as I did or you may feel like you're wading through the same water (albeit much more detailed and highly rendered water). If you've never played the game, this is the edition to get - it's a very fun open world game in the vein of Grand Theft Auto with tons of collectibles, a martial arts beat 'em up combat system, great driving mechanics, fun missions and side-objectives, and, most importantly of all, a good story fronted by a compelling protagonist who leads a double life as both an undercover cop & triad member and a Chinese-American immigrant & Chinese national. As another Asian-American who's faced confusion stemming from a bi-cultural background, I find Wei Shen to be a well written, sympathetic and multi-faceted hero/anti-hero. In addition, the ties the campaign and DLC episodes share with HK Crime and Kung Fu films (references, atmosphere, setting, style) alone are enough to draw me in to its highly detailed vision of modern Hong Kong and keep me playing in it time and time again.

												Better than ever! I owned the original and I have a special relationship with this game. It was the first game that I bought, installed, and played after building my first rig. But that aside...The controls are better and it seems that you have access to police vehicles earlier. Those may have originally been part of DLC's from the original but Im not sure. (Specifically I am talking about the HKPD SUV). The non-police vehicle that I just got very early on was something that I dont remember at all, the custom van with the air-brushed dragons on it. Im not complaining. Actually it makes getting around easier.The textures on Wei look better. However, the actual world itself doesnt seem to be any different than the original with the HD Texture pack isntalled. The devs say its actually better but I cant really see a difference.But if you have never played this game then you have to get it. You wont regret it. This is everything that Grand Theft Auto wishes it could be and never was. Nor can GTA ever be this good because they have gone too extreme in their stupidity.			"

												I was loving this game, REALLY loving this game. Everything seemed great at first. The gameplay was fun, the story was interesting, the graphics were beautiful, but then everything fell apart. The notoriously buggy game began to glitch to where I couldn't complete missions or unlock achievements. Great game, but it's a waste of my time and money if I can't finish playing it.			"

												I've already completed the game on Xbox and there's not a doubt in my mind that this is a great game. Sadly, the PC version doesn't work and crashes very frequently, essentially making it unplayable. The developers have not been providing help or making updates for a long time so there seems to be no hope of a fix either.Therefore I'll have to give this game a negative review but, if you have a game console that can play it then I definitely recommend you play it there!

												Ok lets look at sleeping dogs. Ill look at the game in a pro/ con style and finish with my conclusion of the game.Pro:     Amazing story. I enjoyed the story that was being told in sleeping dogs. Sure i am like 50% done with the stroy but of the 50% i enjoyed it alot.      Likeable characters. There were so many cool characters that we see in sleeping dogs to which i enjoy their dialog how they developed in the story.      Loads of playablility. You have alot of things to do in order to 100% the game. Main story, side quests, and a bunch of collectables.Con:       Driving really does suck. The camera when going in reverse the camera has a nasty habit of rotating without my input and when i acellerate after reversing. Lets just say the camera can be your worse enemy when driving.        Races. Holy crap isnt this just a mix bag. I played all of gta 5 which i can say is for the most part is your sandbox game. Here they add quite a bit of racing... well we know the camera is your worst enemy so this can not be bad. It is. It took a page from need for speed and made the races very winding and you have incoming cars. What makes it work for need for speed is that the cars control well, here just no.       Hand to hand fighting is very much of a slug fest. It isnt fun, especially when fighting the fat dudes. It really shows when you fight them. Honestly i think they could of fleshed out the fighting so if the player preform a specific move against these enemies then the fight gets much easier.        Wheres my gun? Yes the game has a nasty habit of taking away your guns alot of the time. Using a gun whenever i want once i unlock it would make the game more enjoyable.        Please god i dont drive shotgun. When driving on a rails like shooting segment on the highway. The games mechanic is when you are driving a car and you aim your gun time slows down. Yea that doesnt happen in these moments. These moments tend to carry on way too long with way too many enemies to shoot.       Music.....not so memoriable.Conclusion:       The game was a nice gift but in all honesty. The more i play the harder it feels to enjoy the game. With all these flaws it just doesnt make for a good sandbox experience. I can say sleeping dogs is pretty much a poor mans gta but in hong kong. I also am getting a feeling that any game with the use of the word dog in the title is doomed to be a meh game at best. I unfortunantly can not reccomend the game and with all the fighting with the camera which i never had an issue with games like saints row or gta it really is a shame. It has a great story and great characters but that alone can not carry the game.			"

												I just really don't like the buggy, glitchy digusting mess of a combat system. I can see it deriving its combat style from the Batman Arkham series but firstly, it's way too punishing, especially the time frames between attacks and countering, and when the player just freezes when you 'miss' a counter. Secondly, there are many bugs and glitches with the combat system. I could just throw a knife at an opponent and then find myself facing the 'You are dead' screen a second later. Finally, the combat system itself is just too uninnovative and bland in my opinion. Sure you have those really cool grapple environmental kills, but mostly? It's just left click, left click, hold left click. Batman was able to flesh out its combat with stealth, careful planning and precision, as well as a wide variety of gadgets at your disposal. This, this is just a slugfest. Honestly I really love many other aspects of the game, from the storytelling to the music. But I'm just uninstalling this because it isn't really a game if it leaves a sour taste in your mouth after playing it.			"

												I have wondered for some time now if I should get the definitive edition of sleeping dogs as  I enjoyed the origninal sleeping dogs years ago. The definitive edition is definitively an unsubstantial improvement to sleeping dogs for the computer.The definitive edition offers slightly improved models in cinematic mode as well as horrible physics objects added to the world that serve no purpose other than to highlight that the physics are terrible. Also your save from the original sleeping dogs DOES NOT work in the definitive edition (despite no change in story or content) and achievements occassionally do not unlock. Those last issues werent a factor for me, but its worth mentioning. This was a shoddy attempt to resell the same game, unlike some other remastered games.If you have played gta on the computer, it is impossible to ignore how clunky sleeping dogs is. I refunded.			"

												This game flat out lies in its minimum requirements. It will not run on an Intel HD 2500. It will not run on an Intel HD 3000. Square Enix refused to test their game again to find updated minimum requirements, instead posting the minimum requirements for the original version of the game (which has of course been taken off of steam to force players to buy the ""updated"" version which costs $20 more). Unfortunately, I bought this game far before the new Steam refund policy was updated, so I am stuck with a useless game that I wasted $30 on. Don't bother reading the System Requirements.			"

												I like the graphical changes, Hong Kong really does feel alive.I don't like the lack of save compatibility. I bought it because of the DLCs. I wanted to complete all the achievements, but that was impossible, since it's a separate game, and isn't an upgrade. Okay, I said, no problem, I'll just load my save file and just play the DLC stuff. Oh wait, you can't do that - the save gets ""corrupted"". Also the controls are changed (since when is counter ""e""?!).Still, if you haven't played the normal version and/or want to get the DLCs - buy this. The game is amazing, the story is cool, there are lots of things to do.			"

												Holy hell, this game is good, finished the main story line within 16 hours including a couple of the side missions. I'm hooked and can't wait to play some more side missions and do some cop jobs. The story was really interesting and made me abandon any social life I had prior to me clicking the play button on the game.It really is worth investing time into this game, it starts off simple as a little foot soldier for the Sun on Yee at the night market as an undercover officer which then leads to the boss of the gang you're in respecting you and getting you a promotion, you then advance through the triad on a perilous and profoundly action packed adventure.Even though I finished the story line, there is tons of side missions and events that I have missed and are set for me to do now.9/10 - (It would feel like I'm exaggerating if I put down 10/10 so I put 9, but really I mean a 10 ;-;).

												本次游戏体验是非常愉快的，18个小时的游戏时间中间还有好多过场动画跳过了，所以阿杰死去的情节被我跳过了（遗憾……），游戏之中的音乐以及周围人设的声音好评让人置身于热闹繁华的香港城市之间，打斗场面的拳拳到肉也十分令我满意。它相较于我们平时热衷的GTA5，在互动上下的功夫更多，有卡拉OK、解密、开锁、找寻密码等一系列丰富多彩的任务，而且在碰撞人物的过程中，人物会有不同的动作触发，这是我所关注到的游戏细节上做的到位的地方，如果此游戏10分满分的话，我综合以上的优点会打8分。下面说说缺点，剧情有点繁乱，本来以为狗眼林是最终BOSS，结果又来了个大嘴李，最后又来个佩德鲁，所以一直就有BOSS陪伴在我们身边（滑稽），还有主角对于自己的定位确实也十分挣扎，这虽然可以理解，但是又有些过激了感觉，这也不是让我感觉很满意，最后，我要吐槽的一点就是人物的脸部设计完全与周围环境设计相违和，感觉人物的脸型 眼部都是贴上去的，十分不和谐，不自然，这让我刚刚对香港环境激发起的climax又褪去，好好的一个港仔，非要说着流利的英语来显示自己的旧金山生活，不如入乡随俗说地道的粤语才是，如果这样我可能就会给到8.5到9的高分了。别的真的没什么吐槽的，或许Social Club还有吐槽的地方，不过我暂时还没有玩那么多，只是把主线任务做完了而已，总体感觉真的是很良心的作品，虽然公司已经沙扬娜拉了，但是我仍然对这一部Sleeping Dogs饱含热情，永远热血永远无赖地战斗下去。			"

												Edited : found out some of the outfits/vehicles have to be earned now so they are present.The denser population and improved gfx makes the game feel allot more alive, however it does NOT include ALL dlc but a portion of it.The missing dlc's are boosters aparantly the outfits/vehicles are unlocked through missions and some stuff is in a new store.If you have never played the game be4 its basicly a choice between, possible cheat like booster dlc's or better gfx and a more lifelike population.On a sidenote im running a fairly beastly rig so i can max all settings easely HOWEVER the game really heats up my gpu's for no apparant reason and the build in fps cap is pretty much 0 help eventhough having a build in cap does seem to make third party fps caps run wonky [stuttering / input lagg] eventhough fps is held up with no problem.The most demanding games on the market make my gpu's run at early 70 degrees average games at 50/60 where as this game pushes all of my cards to 80+ peaking at 87 wich is unheard of for me, not sure if bad programming or unlucky  me for it just not liking my setup ?I will recommend this game but again not if you already own it 15 bucks for a gfx boost and denser population in trade for about 6 dlc's the option to use boosters is just not worth it. [specially considering the optimization the original ran like butter forced past its max settings with gpu control pannel at 60 degrees max on gpu]I have to say im getting into it more and more the more i play :D			"

												One of the best GTA-style games I've played. Hong Kong oozes atmosphere and character, and everywhere you look is another homage to Hong Kong action flicks. The combat hits the exact right level of complexity and difficulty, and the city is fun to traverse. Plenty of collectables that give rewards for grabbing them, and show up on the minimap when you finish certain missions (I have a pet peeve of games with lots of collectables but no proper way to track them down). Wei Shen is a likeable protagonist, and the story is great. The DLCs are also pretty well done. Really wish there was more!			"

												The game is my guilty pleasure. TL;DR is on the bottomIt's way too underrated and imo it's better than some of the games that the AAA publishers release now like a diarrhea on our plates when we were expecting something delicious (I'm looking at you, watch_dogs).You are basically a guy from Hong Kong that visited America and now came back. You are recruited as an undercover cop and have to work with a triad along with your friend and other people. There comes the plot, which is very well written and kept me interested when I wasn't putting people's heads into saw tables.The fighting is very fun and satisfying. There is also cover-based shooting, which is not necessary a bad thing - mostly because it doesn't overuse it. The game has great amount of detail and AMAZING atmosphere.It also has hacking minigames, which most ironically are better than hacking in watch_dogs, which is a game focused on hacking. There aren't much collectibles, sadly - a thing I enjoy in sandboxes a lot.The game does Ride to hell: Retribution kind of thing where you go on a date and you bang her.However, people at United Front Games aren't 12 year old immature idiots, so it's off camera.Speaking of cameras, there is a side-mission where you beat up some thugs, hack the camera in the same area and go back to your house. When you do that, you access the camera view and choose which guy is a drug dealer, thus he has to go with the nice men with guns to a building where people come in a lot but don't seem to come out so much.Remember when I said about putting people's heads into saw tables? There is a lot of environment kills which are nicely varied and fun. Some of them are brutal, like cutting someone's head in half in an air vent, and some of them are silly, like drowning someone in his own p1ss. These are just two, but there are quite a lot. You can get melee weapons in cars and next to your enemy's dead body if he had one, but they break after few hits.But of course, what would be a good third-person sandbox without drivingcough cough Batman: Arkham City cough cough? There is one guy with a magical ability to teleport between the points you can get your own cars. You get new cars by side-missions, races and buying them if you're the rich kid. You can also ''borrow'' cars from the citizens, just like a thief ''borrows'' your money and a serial killer ''borrows'' your life. People who were once behind Need For Speed (if I'm not mistaken) were programming the car controls and they make me moist. The driving is fun and with an ability to ram into people's stuff the developers threw reality out of the window and nicely welcomed fun into their house - something that the AAA publishers treat like the ultimate sin. However, with a button to open your car's door and jump out of onto another person's car they asked fun to help them hang reality and hit it with a baseball bat like a pinata. As I mentioned earlier there are races which are fun and rewarding. You get money and Face Experience points for winning a race, but some of them give you outfits or new cars. Oh, I think I forgot to mention the leveling system.You basically got three experience bars: Triad XP, Cop XP and Face XP. Both of Triad and Cop XP have 2 upgrade paths.You can only get Triad XP in main missions. The more gruesome you are, the more you get. Cop XP can be received in main-missions as well, but also side-missions. If you don't kill anyone innocent and do no property damage in a main-mission or side-mission, you get more XP. The Face XP allows you to get more things that you can wear to have small yet balanced bonuses and give various upgrades as well. Another upgrade tree is the combos you can do. In one of the missions you go with a girl to a kung-fu school that you were once a student of. Your teacher teaches you one combo for free and then asks you to get his lost statues back. For each one of them, you get a new combo of your choice and if you get all of them, you get an advanced counter move. The basic counter is OP by itself, so now you're basically the Thor of Hong Kong. If you like references, then you will enjoy that aspect as well. For example, there is a yellow jumpsuit referencing a movie starring Bruce Lee. Almost every enemy is dressed in a suit or in something that a young teen would consider ''cool'', so killing them in a bright yellow jumpsuit that can probably kill them just because of how intense the color is can never not be fun. I know I said the word ''fun'' a lot in this review of mine, so if you ever want to read this whole wall of text remember to take a shot every time I mention the word ''fun''. Warning: I don't take the responsibility of you dropping dead.TL;DRGet the game and don't ask questions - especially when it's on sale.			"

												This game is gruesome in an all-too-good way. If you want an actually biting and well-engineered game with the message that crime doesn't pay, play this game. It demonstrates exactly why the criminal lifestyle is bad without forcing it down your throat or completely jerking your chain like GTA4 does. You lose friends - emotionally and literally - you make enemies, you suffer, you bleed, you break, you hurt, and some things you just have to let go in order to live. Hong Kong is a beautiful and mean place, and you get to find out first-hand just how terrible it can be to be a gangster.Visually and audibly this game is absolutely beautiful even despite the dicky optimization on PC, and its gameplay is so satisfying and free-feeling even when you're just blitzing main quests like I did my first time around. The first time you roll around the neon-lit Hong Kong at night while listening to chilled out electronic tracks on Ninja Tune will take your breath away, I guarantee it. Story-wise, the story can be a BIT spotty, but it's hardly gaping with holes and it's easy to suspend your disbelief to understand them. The developers seemed to actually care about the fact that you might want to cut loose and plough through a shopping district sometimes after a hard mission, so you only get punished for murder through police attention and, if you're on a mission, reduced Cop XP rather than revoking money or XP retroactively.The characters are also REALLY likeable and surprisingly memorable even with such a wide cast. You will learn to love Jackie Ma, you will learn to loathe Dogeyes, and you will learn to breathe like Wei Shen.Hong Kong is a cruel place, but it's also a beautiful place.This game makes me want to visit it for real.Do not pass up your chance to play this, if you ever get it.

												One of the best open world games you can get your hands on.This should be among the top titles like GTA, but it doesn't have multiplayer, which makes it harder for it to compete.That being said, the game has a ♥♥♥♥♥on of replayability, i've found myself playing this game for 6.5 hours in one sitting without even noticing the time, doing all kinds of sidemissions and stuff, not even focussing on the main story yet, which is really awesome as well.Combat is focused on melee combat which works really, really well. There's guns too, but in (Sleeping Dogs') Hong Kong you won't come across any unless you mess with really bad people (or cops).This feels very realistic and good, melee combat gives you a heavy sense of impact and by unlocking certain skills and using certain moves you can make every melee encounter feel just as cool as the first.(E.g grabbing, rushing, countering, throwing, using environment etc according to who you're facing).With that being said, having a gun gives you a feeling of power. You really do feel like you should be careful with it because if you start slinging it around the local PD will do everything to hand your♥♥♥♥♥to you personally. It feels as if you'd have a gun on you in a real streetfight, for a backup measure if♥♥♥♥♥♥really hits the fan.The graphics are great (even to this date stuff looks really nice), framerate is smooth and the environment looks really cool with alleys and stuff to rush through or fight in. (I normally don't like asian settings in games for some reason).The driving works really well, there's a lot of grip if you pick the right speed and if you do it right, you can rush through a densely populated Hong Kong at will. You can drift (not for long distances though, mainly for cornering), ram (seems unrealistic but it's fun) and even jump from your vehicle to another. Heck, just sitting on a bike and holding your handbrake while pinning the throttle to do a quick U turn whilst standing still feels and looks amazing thanks to the cool camera angle.The camera angles are generally good throughout the game (good meaning they're not annoying or bad in any way), but you'll occasionally have them act up in tight spaces, although this isn't common.Overall the game is amazing, a really underrated gem.

												This game is gruesome in an all-too-good way. If you want an actually biting and well-engineered game with the message that crime doesn't pay, play this game. It demonstrates exactly why the criminal lifestyle is bad without forcing it down your throat or completely jerking your chain like GTA4 does. You lose friends - emotionally and literally - you make enemies, you suffer, you bleed, you break, you hurt, and some things you just have to let go in order to live. Hong Kong is a beautiful and mean place, and you get to find out first-hand just how terrible it can be to be a gangster.Visually and audibly this game is absolutely beautiful even despite the dicky optimization on PC, and its gameplay is so satisfying and free-feeling even when you're just blitzing main quests like I did my first time around. The first time you roll around the neon-lit Hong Kong at night while listening to chilled out electronic tracks on Ninja Tune will take your breath away, I guarantee it. Story-wise, the story can be a BIT spotty, but it's hardly gaping with holes and it's easy to suspend your disbelief to understand them.

												 Very good and fun GTA clone. A good story to enjoy, lots of gore and hard violence.Crisp and sharp graphics ( and I say it as an owner of an old machine) , cool music and interesting main story make up for some repetitive missions.Missions are involve most of the time driving and hand to hand combat.Sometimes challenging, but far from a hard game, SE is, in the bottom line, a fun game to play with a protagonist (Wei Shen) to remember.""Year of the snake"" addition is forgettable, just adds more of the same if you played it after playing main game (which makes sense logically/chronically , but then you get items for it... go figure.), while ""Nightmare"" is fun to stray from main story.This edition has no trading cards !!! (It had in the previous version)			"

												This defenalty is a step up from the original Sleeping Dogs game. Better graphics, I think slightly more traffic (cant really tell). However you don't get all the DLC from the start, and you need to go through the game, which the description of the game fails to state, even the clothes you would of previously got for free you need to purchase in the Night Market (a yellow icon which says Legendary Clothes).Overall Verdict:Graphics - 10/10Gameplay - 10/10Variety - 7/10 (The same gameplay)Worded Verdict -  I recommend this game, even if you have played the original, but the experience wont be as enjoyable than if you never played the game	 "

												First I was very sceptical if someone other than Rockstar could create a game that is worth of the GTA genre of games, but holy smokes was I surprised. I never played the original sleeping dogs as I never got around to it and when I discovered it, it did look quite a bit ""last gen"".The second I saw there was a HD edition coming out I was all for trying it out though and honestly wow. If you like open world games with lots of icons and things to do on the map and love living the gangster life style (at least virtually), then this game is what you need in your life.There are so many things to do in this game and so many ways to become better, because ranking up means you get new skills, but you need to learn the combos for it as well, so it keeps challenging you and also asks you to mix things up to get the highest possible scores on your missions, etc.In short, there are many fun hours in this game, loads of interesting content and characters and a great story.Dive in and experience a truly underrated game. I believe with proper marketing this game would have become the link between GTA 4 episodes from liberty city and GTA V, for ever GTA fan. Sadly it seems many people missed to pick up this gem of a game.10/10 - would have paid 50 Euros for it.			"

												At first, it certainly does appear to be inspired by Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto series, with protagonist Wei Shen thrown into a life of crime and asked to do horrendous things to progress the plot. But quickly it reveals itself to be much more than that. Early on it's explained that Shen is actually an undercover cop, sent into Hong Kong to climb the ranks of the Triads and take them down from the inside, creating a conflicted protagonist that's easy to sympathize with.Sleeping Dogs is a fun and forward-thinking sandbox game. The missions may be samey, but the core experience is varied and enjoyable. Great stuff.			"

Posted: June 8, 2015
												On the game:Great addition to the True Crime series. For those of you guys who don't know, this game was/is [originally] True Crime: Hong Kong. Due to the inadquate sales of True Crime: New York City, Activision didn't wanna follow through publishing this game after it had been in development for 3 years. It was then picked back up by Square Enix, thankfully. And as of december 2014 of last year, Activision apparrently left the True Crime trademark abandoned. So if there's a Sleeping Dogs 2, it might just be True Crime [whatever] if Square Enix feels like registering it. Unless everyone's happy with ""Sleeping Dogs"". lol.Gameplay:The game has great emphasis on combat. This is what the first game was known for. That, and the alternate mission pathways and varied directions in story the player had access to. This game is more linear, story/gameplay-wise, but everything else in it is what you'd find in a True Crime game. The slow-mo, the combat(which has been expanded upon with environmental interactions and takedowns, like putting an enemie's head between a car's inside and it's door and slaming the door shut on it 'till he passes out or bleeds/dies), the ability upgrade system, and the detail in the worldspace. With a little more. Can't say much for firearms yet, because I haven't gotten far enough in the game to have access to all of them yet. Just a pistol, smg, and a shotgun. And a cover system to be used with them, along with it's own forms of interaction. Movement is great, like when chasing down a thug and free-running. Driving works well.Graphics:They're beautiful. They're not as good as Watch Dogs, but they're great on their own. Hong Kong is colorful, lighting is great, and textures and models are revised for the definitive edition. Many(kinda) graphics settings are available to tweak. Don't like that the ambient occlusion and anti-aliasing(if no other method of standard/advanced AA is being used, FXAA) are hardcoded, but you can just turn them down to their lowest qualities for more FPS. Animations are also great. Weather effects, like when it rains, look great. Water isn't Watch Dogs', but it's good. Still some low-res textures that Watch Dogs doesn't have, though. I'm a graphics wh_re. :)Hmm. But no FOV slider, though. Supposedly a higher fov angle than the standard edition's, but it's still tight for me. 'cause I get motion sickness.Soundtrack and audio:Some stuff is good. The voice acting performances are good. Obviously the main characters' are best. Music is great, as it should be for this kind of game.Performance:I've seen many people complaining about the performance of this Definitive Edition, as they say the regular version played fine. IDK, but I'm not getting their issues.These are my specs..GPU - HD 6950 1GB - latest drivers in useCPU - i5 2500K, @ 3.30GHZRAM - 8GB, 1600MHZRunning with all graphics settings at max, except I turned AA and AO down to their lowest qualities.No stuttering, no bad frame dropping, no nothing. For me, this is like the 2nd-best optimized open-world game like it since Saints Row 3. It just seems that stable. Load fasts, menu's are very responsive, graphics settings enable quickly. No alt-tab issues. Nada. Controls are responsive for everything, overall. Better than Watch Dogs, :PThe game was crashing my computer when trying to load saved game, though. I've put some hours into the game.*SPOILER..Sometime after ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Winston and Peggy's wedding. Game ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *Game crashed my comp 2 or 3 times. Dunno how I got it to stop crashing, but I backed up my save game files(deleted my oldest ones and left my newest ones. my last manual save and my autosave), then deleted my graphics and general(sound, control, etc) configs, then I started the game up and re-configured all my options for those configs.Also validated system files. I think it helped. Recommend creating a system restore point before playing this game, though. I had to use one after the 2nd or 3rd time the game crashed my comp. Also, when you start the game up, don't select ""continue game"". Select ""main story"" instead, and load your save games from there. That's what I've been doing.			"

												One of the best GTA-style games I've played. Hong Kong oozes atmosphere and character, and everywhere you look is another homage to Hong Kong action flicks. The combat hits the exact right level of complexity and difficulty, and the city is fun to traverse. Plenty of collectables that give rewards for grabbing them, and show up on the minimap when you finish certain missions (I have a pet peeve of games with lots of collectables but no proper way to track them down). Wei Shen is a likeable protagonist, and the story is great. The DLCs are also pretty well done. Really wish there was more!			"

												An extremely enjoyable open world game that has incredible lighting and effects, and enjoyable story and a vivid, lively open world hongkong that makes you feel as if you have stepped into hong kong yourself.Sleeping dogs has incredible graphics for its age (mind you, the difinitive edition only added denser crowds, breakable objects and inproved lighting to the original 2012 release), and the city of hong kong feels alive, with the beautiful night markets with neon signs to the city centre and the densely packed pedestrians, who speak either english, cantonese or a mix. of course with today's technoloogy, we can do so much better, so keep your fingers crossed for a sequel.Well to the story. Its pretty well written, and do contain some surprises, and you can really feel the tension between Wei and his police handlers. Its a shame how you do not get a choice of how the story goes, but the ending is pretty dark, and does show the emotional deaths, betrayal and decisions wei makes in the end.Another problem with the game, the developers used too many stereotypes. For example, some of the npcs in the game have such a heavy chinese accent (true, some do, but not all) and some of events in the game feels like its taken from a typical hong kong film (though the game is supposed to have the hong kong martial arts movie feel). The map is big, but of course there are still areas that are inaccessible, and i hope they do create a sequel with a larger, more lifelike hong kong.The fighting and environmental kills do offer a unique taste to the game, and the bullet time when shooting and driving is well done. But some of the controls feel sluggish sometimes, and this game is not without some bugs and glitches which either cause your game to crash or force you to restart the mission.I would give this game an 8/10. a severely underrated game. oh have i mentioned that this game has better hacking than watch_dogs (better, but watchdogs have alot more). Its a bargain to buy this game, especially during steam sales. With its success in its formula, i have a feeling the developers could not be working on an actual sequal (or maybe with a new character), since they game up on triad wars.			"

												The Dogs may be sleeping, but the bugs are certainly awake. Originally an amazing game, ruined by a terrible re-release. Sound bugs, graphic bugs, input bugs & incredibly stupid AI that will infuriate you during missions which count on the AI for assistance. Even the story suffers, as cutscenes seem to stutter and skip even at a low resolution. ( I'm playing on 3.4ghz with 8gb ram and 4gb Geforce 960... the cutscene still runs poorly @ 1280x768  whereas Sleeping Dogs vanilla ran great at the same resolution with my older GTX560)Sleeping Dogs is amazing. Just not this version. Get the standard version instead.. it's still available at some online key stores such as the one beginning with G, ending with A, with a 2 neatly in the middle.  cant wait till im finished with this playthrough so i can uninstall it and put the good version back on..

												I like the original version, not the Definitive edition as all the fun was taken out of it for game balancing. That's not why I like this game or why I bought it in the first place. not over game balancing but how much I enjoyed it from playing my friend's version that was NOT the Definitive Edition. But I can't get the Definitive edition anymore because it's not on Steam. anymore but If I can find the original edition, I do not mind or care to pay 74-75 bucks to get the DLC's. I recommend the ORIGINAL Edition, I CATEGORICALLY refuse to recommend the Definitive edition unless you want to spend hours in the game just to unlock the DZ90 missions instead of right after the first mission being capped successfully			"

												I voted yes to recommend this game, but I gave up on it after 15 hours, why?...Graphis are beautiful, the characters are extremely detailed, animations are great.The combat is amazing, highly addicting!The story is good and engages you enough that you want to see it through.So what killed it for me?Driving...Just the thought of having to drive to another location made me cringe, and thinking of doing any of the driving missions or racing side quests made me nauseous.The driving is atrocious.. to compare it with other ""driving/open world"" games:GTA has one of the best driving.Just Cause 2 is worse than GTASleeping Dogs hits rock bottom.If you feel you can get past this and bare with driving from point A to point B to engage in amazing combat, then it's all worth it.

												Where is all the DLC? I had the old version with all the DLC and now that I have ""Upgraded"" to the Definitive Edition I've lost all of it. I thought all the DLC was included. I am up to the point where all of the DLC got activated before and I've got none of it. Do you have to do tasks to unlock it or something and if that is the case then WTF? It is not bonus DLC if you still have to go and unlock it through normal gameplay since most people like all that DLC for the leg up and looking badass at the start with the cars too. You can't even go back to the old version since it replaces it in your library.And also they have changed how countering works, its much harder now as you can only counter if standing still, if you're in the middle of a combo and someone else attacks you there is nothing you can do. It forces you to do nothing but counter since the second you start a combo and someone esle attacks you, you're are stuffed.Don't get me wrong the game seems better, it is more lively with more going on and the visuals and audio is certainly improved, the countering I guess you can argue is a little more realistic but really, come on its game.Hopefully the DLC thing is a bug and they fix it and if so then definitelly this is the version to get, it does out do the original in all ways they have claimed.

												This is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played... ( BUT I LOVE IT ! ) EDIT: July 2015...I bought an Xbox wired controller just for this game, and what a difference! Even makes driving easier and can now fight much better. I strongly recommend playing this game with an XBox controller, wired or wireless if you are set up for it.There are several  issues that need attention to make this game playable on a PC from a ported console game. Using a keyboard and mouse for some aspects of this game make it difficult to play on PC, driving being on top of the list. If you intend to play on PC, you may want to get a controller because it is quite obvious that this game was intended to be played using a controller. I say this because a keyboard is either 'on' or 'off' and makes things extremely difficult while a controller has some linear movement, keep this in mind.Playing this game is definitely for the player who has real good keyboard skills and a gamer keyboard and mouse. I am admittedly an older player who loves to play good games and I would like to enjoy this game without this kind of frustration.  Despite this, here is my 'review' of Sleeping Dogs to this point and regardless of my frustration level, will keep it neutral.  PROS:GRAPHICS: One word, Gorgeous! With the HD texture pack, this game is visually wonderful on screen, and you get a genuine feel of the story and atmosphere. The models and textures are some of the best I have seen for a game of this genre. Up till now, SR3 and SR4 were on top of my list, keeping in mind I said a game of this genre. I would love to be able to re-texture some of the clothes and hope that we will be able to do so some time in the future.VOICE ACTING: Doesn’t get better then this,  voice overs can make or break a game and in this instance, the characters are believable and and you can sense the personality of each.MUSIC: Great variety of music and really adds to the atmosphere of the game. It would be great to play the music when out  on foot exploring the sites.STORYLINE and WRITING: Compelling. I got drawn right into my character's story and what he is doing or trying to do. Frankly, for this reason alone I will try and continue the game. It is rare that I can bond with my character and I have with Wei. Later on you can see him start to change and almost feel the internal conflicts he is having. I know many disagree, but I for one feel that the story and writing are excellent for a game.ANIMATIONS: WOW! Good stuff here and wonderfully done, fluid and believable, when you pull off a good move in a fight, makes you feel like you really did something. I would like to see a 'walk' option rather then Wei jogging all the time when out exploring, if there is one I haven't found it. There is one pet peeve I have and that is if Wei is wearing an outfit and he is barefoot (wearing the GSP outfit as an example) in a fight, or if he kneels down or is in a move that requires him to bend down, his foot goes into the ground. That is, his toes go into the ground. They don't flex or bend as they should. A small detail. The modelers and animators need to pay more attention to details such as this.CLOTHING and ACCESSORIES: Personally, I am not one who cares about 'outfits'. But I have to say that this game offers many and all are very well done. The diffuse textures, normals mapping and specular really show on the clothing and are a visual treat in game. I would like to see the ability to breakdown some of these 'set outfits' such as the GSP outfit and use the items separately, that is, have the option to 'mix and match'. An example would be, using the red GSP shorts with a hoody and red tennies. I for one don't care if a clothing item gives me a bonus in a skill or not. That said, the separate clothing items and outfits are excellent. By the Wei?...who ever came up with those boxers? What were you drinking? Those will be the first thing I hope to re texture. I have seen screen shots of some yellow beach shorts but have not found them, it would have been nice to have some shorts for Wei to wear. DLC clothing: Zodiac Tournament. Once you get through this, you get two outfits, both with good looking shorts especially the Ikoze yellow shorts. Problem is, it is an 'outfit' again, you can't use the shorts by them selves. But the real thing that ticked me off is when wearing both outfits you are barefoot. Fine by me, barefoot is good, but when you walk anywhere you hear the sound of walking in shoes?...what! Spoiled the whole thing for me, what was QC doing?Then to add for more confusion...and this is actually funny, remember...you're in Hong Kong which used to be a British Commonweatlh so drive on the OTHER side of the road!  To add to the keyboard issue, the camera has a nasty habit of swinging around 180 degrees facing the other direction during your driving or if you swing your car or bike around.In my game, Wei is using the slowest bike available and for a car, Wei is using the Bisai or Smart car equivalent. Why? Least I  can drive them...somewhat. In Saints Row 3, I can drive like no ones concern. I can power slide, take corners and keep most vehicles in SR3 (especially the bikes) under control. The driving commands in this game are almost identical, yet, because they move so fast, the keyboard commands usually amplify the command and it is one crash after another, you have to try and think ahead if possible. If any of you played the first Saints Row (PC) and tried to drive in that game? This is a close second on the list. EDIT: Dumb luck was with me....moving on.Other minor Cons, this game should have a difficulty level setting. Just for the sake of the story itself, being able to just play the game at a slower and easier pace, and for those hard core folks...let them set it for that. This game was made for console, so the keyboard commands for some moves is complex and can only use a few of them. Not a game breaker, but it is difficult. Having a broken finger on my left had makes the 'Q' key and 'left shift' almost impossible to use, but you can remap some keys. It would be nice to take screen shots without the HUD, I am not aware of a way to do this if there is. Lastly, the GPS is not reliable as far as taking you to the right location during a mission. I have had this happen many times in game already. It took me two hours to figure this out on a side mission 'Cheaters Never Prosper Part 3'  There is a short cut to save time and when you do get there...look for a window. I don't think that qualifys as a 'spoiler'. CONCLUSION: If you are going to try this on PC, fair warning. Not for the novice player and especially if you have a lack of patient or short tempered. This game is challenging. Despite my various frustrations, I like this game...very much. A visual treat for the eyes, great story and one can easily bond with your character. This game does not work well on a keyboard and mouse and at this point never will. Strictly my opinion. But I will say it is worth the money and I can go even further and say that Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition has a replay value for sure. Is this my favorite game (of this genre)? No, because of the technical issues, SR3 is still on top of my list. I appreciate the hard work and many talents that went into the development of this game, but as usual, most games have a priority for the console market and a conversion or port to PC only makes this game suffer from that process. It is sad that game developers get hung up on the console market as they do and ingnore the PC folks as a last option. On my scale of 1 to 10....I give this an 8.    A wonderful game, but Wei too many technical glitches. I hope we get to see Wei again.			"

												Pro:+GTA with fists of fury martial arts done right +Funny dialogue specially with the AI is in panic mode they speak chinese and english mix up to me more like chiglish+Good crime story +Main mission and Side mission are fun to play+Hong Kong Settings Con:-The AI is dumb if you kill somebody they don't react to the situation the girl who sell those dragon drinks keeps on dancing like ""is okay to see a dead body laying around"" plus the NPC don't call the cups if they see me in a killing spree also that ambulance can do nothing to revive a person ones they finish they just stand around like statues -No Japanese  -Needs more combos of fighting styles Overall: Its a very good game I say is better then GTA becuase it takes place in Hong Kong not always USA plus more fists then guns. AI really sucks, but it wont distract of the overall fun of the game. I recommended....^_^			"

- An open world action game à la Grand Theft Auto, only this time you're not the criminal but the cop. Follow the storyline, engage in side activities and explore the city of Hong Kong in all of its beauty with the updated graphics from the Definitive Edition equaling ensured entertainment.Review score: Essential Purchase⇓ Personal Review ⇓Pro Beautiful world design & atmosphere Good story Updated graphics (Limited) character customization Plenty of side objectives/activities Includes DLCCon Vehicle handling Weapon combat Small visual bugs from time to time Some DLC parts might not have received the full graphical updateStorySet in the beautiful city of Hong Kong officer Wei Shen is tasked to bring down the local Triad gang Sun On Yee as an uncercover cop. He gets introduced into the mafia by his old friend Jackie Ma from where he starts working his way up to the top of the criminal circuit. Wei Shen is a loyal person, that loyalty brings him into trouble in both sides of the law because trying to do good takes it toll and possibly his sanity.The story is well written and ensures that the protagonist doesn't climb up in the ranks too fast in an unrealistic manner. Obviously you shouldn't expect the drama, character relations and humor known from the GTA franchises in this game. Simply because this game depicts how it feels like to survive in a triad gang, not how to save your marriage or how to setup your own drug empire in the middle of a desert.GraphicsWith the Definitive Edition this game received a graphical update and boy does it show. If you ever want to visit Hong Kong, play this game first. Not that it will be a perfect tour guide, but it really captivates the atmosphere of this asian city with its many districts. Clean and modern looking in 'downtown' area, flashy neon signs and dense ugly looking high-rises in the poorer parts of the city and the many houseboats docked at the docking area. While playing this game I often felt like I was playing in a living, breathing world. That's something I didn't always have while playing a GTA game. Sure I've never been in Hong Kong or any asian city, but after playing this game it kinda feels like I did.The graphical update also shows during cutscenes where it looks like this game is actually just two years old instead of the original four. There can be some graphical glitches here and there, i.e. npc's popping in/out of screen in front of your face and certain visual effects not always appearing while driving vehicles. But nothing too troublesome.GameplayI only played this game with a controller so I can't give any input on how it feels with mouse and keyboard. In general I'm very positive about it although there are some points which did annoy me. First off the driving mechanics could be better, even while playing with a controller I have to tab my stick constantly while making larger turns instead of one fluid movement. Bikes have a larger turning radius than cars and driving a car backwards is like driving on ice. But you'll get used to it eventually and thus won't be as big of a problem than in the beginning.The combat in this game is clearly pointed towards melee combat. Reason being that in the triad culture most fights are fought with bare hands and less with fire arms like we're used to in the west. There are a lot of fighting moves to learn and they all transition perfectly with each other when fighting. The downside to this is that the weapon combat not as refined as in other games.			"

The mechanics are almost identical to the GTA games, so if you've played a GTA game and you liked it, you will feel comfortable with this one. The story is very interesting and the characters too. The combat system is also nice. If you see this game during a summer or winter sale, you really should buy it!			"

However, because of a few hiccups I'll only be able to give this game a 4.9 out of 5 stars. For instance, honking the horn or turning on sirens does nothing. The people never move and while I'm happy they don't jump scared wild (from far away or near) like in other games. It would be nice if they did something. Also, the font is WAY too tiny.

I highly recommend this if you haven't played it yet.			"

The design of the game is perfect. Detailed where necessary, simplified where needed. Some textures of roads and houses are too small in size, often repeated, but it's not annoying.Also, the game is very picturesque! The shadows are сolored, reflections are qualitative. In rainy Hong Kong a lot of romantic views. Excellent panorama of skyscrapers.Impressive work of director. You do not leave a feeling that you take part in the film with Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan.Good luck and thank you very much for developers!Гениальная игра!

												Like being in a Hong Kong movie, for realz! Great over-the-top action with a semi-interesting plot about an undercover cop working for the Triads. You're there for the action, the Kung Fu and the melting of faces against rotating fan blades. It's like your own personal Johnnie To movie with the occasional romance by Wai Ka-Fai (edit: later on, when you have access to guns, you even have your own Hard Boiled experience inside an hospital). Open-world like GTA but driving in left-handed traffic and not as dead-serious and unfun. While not as freadikulous as Saints Row 4, it is still enjoyable and has its exquisite moments of WTF (like beating some henchmen with a large fish taken from the aquarium you just broke with another henchman's head). The  port suffers from consolitis (camera going wild with mouse) and the menus and certain actions (like using your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ phone) are full of illogical choices for a keyboard player. Still, the game is really enjoyable and makes you eagerly await the next mission like it was a sequel to Election. Worth your time and sweaty (dragon) palms.			"

												In the half hour that I've played so far of this game, it seems much more solid than the original Sleeping Dogs. The lighting, shadows and reflections all look much better and the game gets better framerates than the old verison. The DLC is also a nice addition and for $15 (since I owned the old verison), it doesn't get much better than this. This was a great game to begin with, and now with improved visuals and all of the DLC, it's a must buy IMO.			"

Just because this review is negative doesn't mean I hate the game, I'm having technical difficulties and just downvoting this review without even giving me a hand to fix it makes you a moron, please help me turn this review into positive by giving me solutions.The problem I'm having with this game is that it crashes whenever I attempt to start a new game or start benchmarking making It unplayable for me and that's unfortunate because I was really excited to play this game.As I said from this thread I made:I've done verify game cache, run the game as admin and use compatibility mode (both Win 7 & 8).Since I'm about to ran out of time, I have to refund this game because I can't just waste my money on something that is unplayable. It's a shame.Here's my specs: OS: Windows 10 (Upgraded from Win 8)CPU: AMD A4-5300 APU with Radeon HD Graphics (2 CPUs) -3.4GHzGPU: AMD Radeon HD 7480DRAM: 4GB (3.5 usable)Native Resolution: 1920x1080And hopefully you would comment and help me instead of downvoting this review just because it's negative.

												OLD DOG, NO NEW TRICKS→ OCTOBER 8, 2014 Many open-world, non-linear drive-and-gun games -- with some notable exclusions -- tend to tack on a story merely to loosely justify whatever it is you're doing. But the main thing I made clear in my original review of Sleeping Dogs on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in 2012 is that while it's a blast to play, its story is actually the star of the show. The Definitive Edition for new-gen consoles carries over both of those great traits and adds a decent facelift, and it's just as fun and just as memorable as it was the first time around. An engaging plot littered with memorable characters and a ton of slowly building tension is artfully coupled with solid melee action, gunplay, and driving to create a multi-faceted game that satisfies on all fronts. As far as the aesthetic is concerned, Sleeping Dogs was never an exceptionally pretty game, but The Definitive Edition resolves some of its biggest visual faults and brings it moreSleeping Dogs: Definitive EditionInspired by classic Hollywood and Asian cinema style action thrillers, Sleeping Dogs follows the story of detective Wei Shen as he infiltrates one of Hong Kong's notorious Triad crime syndicates.→ MUCH MORE in line with the PC version. On the Xbox One version I played, draw distances are vastly extended, textures are much sharper, and the overall gloss of the entire convincing recreation of Hong Kong is improved. It doesn't look like a native new-gen game by any stretch of the imagination, however - and it’s disappointing that the framerate stutters a bit when you're on foot running around and exploring, and the camera is still a bit messy in certain circumstances.Again, though, I have to sing the praises of the story. Sleeping Dogs revolves around an undercover Hong Kong detective named Wei Shen. Shen – who's voiced wonderfully by Will Yun Lee in both English and Cantonese, is an interesting protagonist, one with true depth. Shen’s embedded himself with the Hong Kong underworld in order to unravel it from within, and watching him get sucked further and further into peril is fascinating. He's not a nameless hero or a loosely constructed anyman. He seems as real as a character in a movie.Of course, Sleeping Dogs has plenty for you if story isn't your thing. Its driving mechanics are on-point, with lots of different vehicles toting unique feels, from run-down motorcycles and hulking industrial trucks to supped-up sedans and expensive sports cars, and everything in between. Developer United Front Games has crafted a believable and incredibly busy version of Hong Kong that's simply a blast to drive around, explore, and uncover. Likewise, fighting -- whether with your fists, a melee weapon, or a firearm -- is also a lot of fun. There's a ton of collectibles to discover in addition to its meaty campaign, with tons of offshoot side quests to complete. In short, Sleeping Dogs is bound to keep you very busy not only when keeping up with its story, but in simply doing everything within it there is to do.Content-wise, the only notable difference between the old-gen version of Sleeping Dogs and the Definitive Edition is the inclusion of DLC. Both the supernatural-themed Nightmare in North Point and the cop-centric Year of the Snake are included, though I wasn't blown away by either. These separate packs -- which feel disjointed and aren't a part of the campaign -- don't stack up with the likes of GTA IV’s The Lost and the Damned or The Ballad of Gay Tony in terms of the amount of content, the quality of the new characters, or even new objectives. But, it's pretty cool that they're here in case you want to mess with them.Testing out Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition reminded me of a facet I hadn't thought much about since I last played it in 2012: its multi-tiered leveling system. This experience rubric provides Shen with rewards in three different categories: as a cop, as a member of the criminal Triad, and as a citizen of Hong Kong. Earning experience points in these three categories often conflicts with one another, and each category has unique skills associated with it. Delving into this system is a ton of fun, and it's really cool watching Shen get stronger based on how I chose to behave. Displaying disregard for the citizens of Hong Kong won't net you much love in your Face meter, for instance, but upholding the law will surely bring you plenty of cop experience points.Amazon	$24.99	Trending VideosTHE VERDICTBack in 2012, I called Sleeping Dogs one of the biggest -- and most pleasant -- surprises of the year. Two years later, the surprise has obviously dissipated, but that doesn't take away from what United Front Games achieved here. Playing the Definitive Edition reminded me how much I enjoyed its excellent story and characters, combat, and city, but also made me pine for a true new-gen sequel. The differences here might not be worth paying for a second time, but if you missed out on this great open-world action game the first time, you shouldn’t repeat that mistake.Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition PC  8.5GREAT+Same great game+Wonderful story+Fun driving+Good gunplay, melee– Wonky camera "

												Mouse and keyboard controls are pretty bad, lots of little problems indicitave of a lazy console port, and the controller has a ENORMOUS deadzone. Gotta be at least 25% of the analogue stick, which makes driving frustrating and annoying. Shame, because it looks like it'd be fun.			"

The removing touch keyboard, the run as admin from the folder etc, still this crashes 15minutes into play. So don't blame my system, which works flawlessly with the other 489 games on my system.			"

												Square Enix can make one hell of a PC port. There have been very few ports that have been bad by this company. You cant go wrong with this title. If you own the normal edition, you can pass this up without missing a thing...but hey its $15. If this is your first go at the game however, its hard to pass up! It definatly feels more this go around!			"

												Odd timing for a sale, assuming you know what else is going on right now. Just bought this version about 2 weeks ago, for about $30.00. I have to say Sleeping Dogs is one of the best games I've ever played and this version is worth your money if you've never played it before. Anyway, I would defiantly pick it up at the current price for certain; Especially given it's under $10 dollars at the moment. Sort of wish I had waited now, ;).Gameplay is a 9 out of 10. (Bugs in the parkour, missions, etc... hurt this title at times.)Story is a 8 out of 10 but a 10 out of 10 for a video game.Audio is 10 out of 10.Performance is 4 to 8 out of 10 depending upon your system specs. (This doesn't run like the original.)I have issues with United Front at the moment due to a game they're creating called Triad Wars, so keep in mind there's some personal bias behind my words. It's an issue that will resolve in time but they're making a bad move in my opinion at the moment.YOU MAY NOT WANT TO BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL!!!I've bought this game 3 times now, once on PS3, once on PC and again now on PC for the 'Definitive Edition'. From what I can tell: They added fog, may have tweaked the graphics a bit, and seriously f'd the performance up. You'll be probably be disappointed with this as such. They changed up the DLC and you can't remove any of it without hacking it out. This is major issue for some of us (I don't care about that myself.). You also have to buy and/or unlock things now as you progress threw the game. 2 of the DLC's are missing for certain despite what they state, more depending upon which system you came from. (Wasn't a fan of the those anyway and wont list them.) "

About the Combat: I like the special attacks and the shooting is not very good but it isn't bad, just....  you know.....  normal. Conclusion: I recommend that you buy this game in a sale.

												One of my favorite games. However, while the original version worked perfectly for me, this new edition is unplayable. In my case, this is due to the audio cutting out every 3-5 seconds. There is no known fix for this issue, and because Square Enix has decided to take the original off of the market, many people have no legal way of playing this game anymore.			"

												This game has an interesting storyline, fun combat and a interesting open world to run around in.So why do I not recommend it? Because on a technical level it is a complete mess.For some reason the shadow filtering is out of whack on computers sporting a nvidia graphics card and Windows 10.During most of the outside gameplay you will see weird horizontal lines along the pavement, something which I can live with in the original Doom, not in a AAA game from 2014. You can also forget about framepacing and vsync with this game on such a computer. Vsync disabled: the game is a stuttery mess (while fps is above 70 at all times), vsync enabled: tearing, constant tearing. You have to run this game windowed (no native support for borderless windowed) or with the steam overlay's fps counter turned on (which is a idiotic dependency to prevent tearing!). Most of the animations in cutscenes are a janky mess, which completely ruins immersion.Graphically, this game is a mixed bag. The only taxing setting is anti aliasing, shadows are glitched on Windows 10, no matter your setting in-game. Character models and car models look good, the motion blur looks refined as well, but some city geometry and textures look like they belong in a crappy old PS3 game. There is no anisotropic filtering (which has to be forced through your graphics card's driver), so most of the textures look muddy. There is a lot of clipping and the animations in cutscenes are stuttery.There is a great game in here, but the frankly awful optimisation nearly ruin it. It's very hard to see past all these issues and enjoy this game. If your cutscenes look like trash because of bad animations and your gameplay is hampered by technical issues then I cannot recommend it. If you're really interested, pick it up on a console (which might not have these issues), or when it's under €4,00 (or your regional equivalent). Perhaps you're better of than me though if you aren't runnnig Windows 10 with a GTX 970.			"

However now, a few years after release I think to myself how foolish I was underestimating this game and it's potential.So I will talk about this game a bit without spoiling it for you guys.So you're playing as the character Wei who is a undercover agent trying to end the Triad activity in his home town (Hong Kong) as he gets into the Triad gang he slowly makes his way into the hierarchy whilst still being undercover gaining their trust etc. In the game there are numerous occasions where you have to beat the hell out of a bunch of Triad members from different gangs whilst helping your gang and helping the police. As you play the more difficult things get for you and you get into even more struggle.The thing about this game which makes it so damn fun, is how it's a game where instead of using your common guns like you do in (For example: Grand Theft Auto Series) you actually mostly use Wei's insane martial art skills which you get better in the more you play as you are able to unlock different fighting techniques. So the game focuses more about fighting than guns which may sound weak and boring, in my opinion it's a lot more fun than your typical ""Go there, shoot him, chase him, shoot him and drive back"" type of game. And I'm not even saying gun fights are bad in this, they're actually also a crap tonn of fun when there's a gun fight as you don't expect it at all when it happens and then it's just badass! Two rival triad gangs batteling against eachother. So, it's not all just fists and kicks. It's a mix between guns and fighting. (approx. 80% fighting 20% shooting)And you don't just have to do those undercover missions because there are also side jobs which involve you either racing, busting drug deals, leading investigations about different cases and also missions which involve you helping the public allowing you to buy more things throughout the map. Also there's approx 16 hours of main mission gameplay (I might have played a few side jobs in those 16 hours. I'm still doing most of the side jobs and after going to play the 2 DLC's) so as you can see you can have a lot of fun for a long time. Also there's a few collectable items scattered around the map if you're into treasure hunting.Also my favorite thing about this game is: In most areas around the map you can use the enviroment to your advantage. For example: You can throw someone in head first into a branch cutter.These are now my ratings out of 10:-Story: 7/10-Graphics: 6.5/10-Entertainment: 8.5/10-Difficulty (10 being hardest): 6/10Pros------1. God damn great fighting.2. Very immersive and interesting story.3. Funny a lot of the times (if you have a sick humour like me :D)4. Good graphics.5. A big variety of different cars.6. Clothing customization (You can be dressed as some kind of golden statue and that gives you 60% melee defense.)7. Fun side jobs.Cons.------1. You can't keep the weapons/guns you picked up either from the map or during a mission.2. Fighting is too easy. (It's still really fun beating the sh!t out of others)3. You can't start a havoc in the city like you can in GTA with guns and mass murder, instead you are forced to run around town drop kicking everyone which is always still fun.(Those are the legit 3 things I can think of which I didn't really like about the game)11/10 would drop an engine block on a guys face. Personal Recommendation    1. Must get.    2. Recommended purchase.  3. Recommended purchase during sale.  4. Not recommended unless heavily discounted.  5. Not recommended.  "

												The king lives. Sleeping Dogs was an out of nowhere hit, carving out it's own niche in the open-world crime genre while rising from the ashes of True Crime. Running both sides of the gauntlet as an undercover cop, SD has cemented a position in my very soul as one of the best games ever. The Definitive Edition brings you the whole experience, packing in it's many, MANY DLC packages, including a few extra stories taking you to fighting tournaments, Jiang-Shi infested streets, & riots on Chinese New Year.If you're new to SD, step up & buy this. High speed car chases, brutal fistfights, a storyline worth giving a damn about, & more than a few odd outfit choices to wear while shoving a gangster's face into an A/C Unit.Buy Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition.

												Sleeping Dogs might just be a better GTA-style game than the GTA series itself. Now maybe it's just the location, but my oh my, Hong Kong is a lively and beautiful setting contrary to Los Santos in GTA V. Lights, cars, people... everywhere. However, what this game lacks is traffic. That might sounds stupid, but traffic, in my eyes, helps to convey the atmosphere of a busy city, as a New Yorker myself. Mind you this is only a personal request and the lack of which does not take away much. Traffic or no traffic, Hong Kong is still amazing.Speaking of beauty, the textures, for the most part, are very detailed. I say for the most part because often you will find a stray texture that looks horrid in comparison to the ones around it, such as the door to Wei's apartment, as an example. The models for the main characters look great, especially when you can appreciate them up-close in real-time cutscenes. The voice-acting is great too, but the facial animations are pretty mediocre. Lips are synchronized and that's great and all, but the rest of the facial muscles aren't very expressive. Lighting effects convey a vibrant and realistic setting and the reflections are accurate and organic. And the rain.. (OH THE BEAUTIFUL RAIN)... I cannot get enough of the rain, let's just say that. Colors, wetness, all around me... I like it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). And while we're still talking about beauty let me just point out that Sleeping Dogs looks better and runs wayyy better than Watch Dogs. Sleeping Dogs gets an average of 40 fps on my GT 755M and that's on pretty high settings. This is a perfectly playable framerate and serves as a happy medium between 30 and 60 fps. There a few bugs like sometimes not being able to attach to cover for a few seconds in certain spots or a civilian getting stuck in geometry, but these don't really affect your gameplay experience.Hong Kong offers a lot to do: you can buy pork buns, other food, get a massage, and do side quests like stealing a car for someone, distracting the cops, or other various activities. Cars offer great arcade-like style, but sometimes it could feel like you're driving on ice which sometimes gets annoying. But there's a mechanic I've never seen in another game: action hijack. This feature, which lets you hijack another vehicle while driving, emphasizes the Asian-action movie vibe this game successfully accomplishes.While on the topic of action movie, by every mechanic you can see that this is the style the developers were going for. The combat system is wonderfully satisfying and complex in that you can upgrade it to earn new moves and skills such as a leg break or a roundhouse kick. Another mechanic which emphasizes the action-movie vibe is bullet-time. Just like in Max Payne, you can enter slow-motion to do some next-level-human stuff to ultimately wreck your enemies. In Sleeping Dogs this can be triggered by vaulting over cover and aiming or by aiming at enemies while driving. In one side mission, more than 100 motorcyclists were shooting at me consecutively while I was riding shotgun in a car, delivering dope, as gangsters do.In open world games, the story might be a trivial path for some players for its usual mediocrity. However, in Sleeping Dogs, this is not the case. The plot is surprisingly well-written and interesting. It involves Wei Shen, an undercover cop who is becoming too attached to his gangster role. The story, while not as amazing as, let's say: The Last of Us, is still much better than average and is certainly worth playing through.Overall, Sleeping Dogs is an open-world game done right. With an interesting story, great use of freedom, challenging yet satisfying combat system, bullet time, and decent driving, you can't go wrong. Sleeping Dogs is a standout in the genre and a game that melds many features in a manner which works. 9.4/10			"

												Despite an excellent story, decent visuals, a kicking soundtrack, and enjoyable if repetitive combat, the driving is what ruins this game for me. It would be one thing if you could rely less on driving, but literally every story mission involves driving a car that handles like it's going through warm pudding. I stopped playing because your race opponents, people you're chasing, and the cops all make turns on a dime at high speeds, while you skid across the pavement like a cat with booties on.			"

												Sleeping Dogs is the best GTA clone to date,and it is not even that much of a GTA clone.It has enough new mechanics that it feels original and it is.The combat is great and the story is fullfilling.However you should just get the original because none of the DLC are worth the extra cash.The pc port is actually very good so if i were you I would pick this up on sale or buy the orginal for asking price.

												This would be a great game... if it wasn't for the combat. It's basically grapple, punch, repeat. The game tries to let you counter attack, but often does not register that you even pressed the counter attack key.It's a shame. The environments are cool. The characters are neat and memorable. Too bad. Controls got in the way of this being a good game.			"

												I'm suprised by other positive reviews, to me game gave little enjoyment. In fact I feel I spend already too much time on it forcing myself to give it a try...Main cons: - it feels like a failed console port, failing to utilize the keyboard and using uncomfortable key mappings - the fight feels like mortal combat rather than kung fu, requiring you to bash the keys and do combos - there is no way to skip fighting or reduce the difficulty/frequency, you have to ""learn to like it"" - characters and story are way too much of a cliche for me, I can't find any interest in their progression			"

												In my pursuit to take to prison many of my childhood friends, I was stealing a van with my boss's wedding cake from our crime world rival (who stole it first from the cake shop) and then the game froze for the sixth time since I started playing it.There is a -possibly- interesting story about going undercover, loyalty, the true nature of the main character, but it's lost in the middle of a lot of mini games and activities with little to no relation with the main story. Because this is an open world game, so you have karaoke, racing, fighting and from time to time, when you think you are advancing a little into the story you are in fact just unlocking a new mini game, you spent time learning how to play a mini game that is now available in many points in the map. So even if you want to play only the story, you will have to play some unrelated mini game from time to time, that's the way they introduce you to the mini games, they force them at least once into the main story.If the game worked as intended I might be tempted to finish it, but Witcher 3 changed what I expect from open world games, maybe a few years ago when Sleeping Dogs was released I would have convinced myself to keep going but nowadays my free time is too precious.

												Just finished this game. Not gonna say much because most of it has been said already. The things  I loved about this game the fighting even though its not perfect and its annoying sometimes. The moves you can do and the things you can ram the enemy into is great fun. That part never got old. The driving was fun and all the cars felt unique.  The clothing was great and very easy to get. If your having an issue in a mission chances are you can wear an outfit to help ease the difficulty along with venders who sell food to boost you up as well. The city is great and colorful and makes you feel like your in a Hong Kong city. The story is great although you cannot make any changes to it. I really enjoyed the ending.The bad is your gonna have do a ton of counters. A lot of counters so start with counter powerups  first and or wear a vigilante outfit. The motorcycles felt strange and odd. They handle like their on the moon. Their are guns in this game. The very worst part about this game is the slow motion when you on foot. You have to press 2 buttons and its annoying to pull off and just doesnt work very at all. Its not good. I wish it was like the Max Payne games. They say they have different guns in the game but most felt the same. A rifle, a pistol and  a shotgun. Thats about it. Very generic and in cut scenes they do not look right. The scaling is off. However those are minor because most of the game is around the hand to hand fighting and thats mostly fun. They do have mini games that were fun like karoke. I really enjoyed the game.			"

												Just finished this game. Not gonna say much because most of it has been said already. The things  I loved about this game the fighting even though its not perfect and its annoying sometimes. The moves you can do and the things you can ram the enemy into is great fun. That part never got old. The driving was fun and all the cars felt unique.  The clothing was great and very easy to get. If your having an issue in a mission chances are you can wear an outfit to help ease the difficulty along with venders who sell food to boost you up as well. The city is great and colorful and makes you feel like your in a Hong Kong city. The story is great although you cannot make any changes to it. I really enjoyed the ending.The bad is your gonna have do a ton of counters. A lot of counters so start with counter powerups  first and or wear a vigilante outfit. The motorcycles felt strange and odd. They handle like their on the moon. Their are guns in this game. The very worst part about this game is the slow motion when you on foot. You have to press 2 buttons and its annoying to pull off and just doesnt work very at all. Its not good. I wish it was like the Max Payne games. They say they have different guns in the game but most felt the same. A rifle, a pistol and  a shotgun. Thats about it. Very generic and in cut scenes they do not look right. The scaling is off. However those are minor because most of the game is around the hand to hand fighting and thats mostly fun. They do have mini games that were fun like karoke. I really enjoyed the game.			"

												this game is damn enjoyble.....   but then comes with annoying bits that is getting in the way of my experience.one of them is being the counter button is idioticly mapped to the same button to action button (E), forcing me to change the keyboard settings around frequently between fist fights ,gun fights and driving, this really needs to be fixed. the demo controls are somehow better.i say, grab a controller or better yet buy it on a console until a modding community pops up....if only the orginal still exists..

												I got this game on sale, and I was at first not as fond of it, because I couldn't run around being an awful person like in GTA or Saints Row. And because there weren't guns and blah blah blah. But I soon figured out that the fighting style in this game is fantastic, and there are loads of small quick missions to do, so depending on whether I want to beat people up, street race, or play through the main story or one of the police cases, I can do that. I'd reccomend this game if you're looking for a good game to playthough once or twice, it has a good story and memorable characters. I'd give this a 8/10, because they could've added a bigger sandbox element, and there are a few glitches here and there. I haven't played the two other DLCs yet, I'll update when I do.			"

												This game is that game that everyone should at least try, but dosen't beacause it looks like another GTA clone. Well, it's a action sandbox, so it has certain similarity.First of all, the Story, it is really cool, it's easy to like the main character and all, I like how they choose Hong Kong as the city, which makes really hard to understand that you drive on the left, I think even at the end section I still tried to drive on the wrong side. I played on a controller, so I don't know if the keyboard + mouse is good to play, but it is almost necessary to switch to the mouse in some ""puzzle"" sections, like the picklock, it's a LOT easier with the mouse, and for some reason, selecting icons on the map with the controller just doesn't work well. But the controls are nice, the fighting sections are really cool, and you got new moves as the game goes, but even at the begging, just keep using counter, you will use it a lot here.The car sections are okay, not that nice, but it isn't bad as GTA IV.The triads ambient is probally my favorite part, it's well done.I think the worst part of the game are the side quests, they are really repetitive, and not as fun, aside for some DLC (which are included) quests, like the Zodiac Tournament. The DZS-90 DLC is weird, because when you have acess to the car, the game is almost over, so it just doesn't matter.Another thing is the lenght, it's quite short actually, my playtime is just 27.5 hours, and I beat the main game and the two DLC's cenarios (which are really boring and not well made, but play it first, it gives itens on the main campaing).Overwall, Sleeping Dogs is a really nice game, I reccomend buying it, especially on some promotion or sale.

												Cliched storyline, wonky controls, and played out gameplay setting (because what we need are more open world games). Plays like a GTA clone with little attempt to develop gameplay systems that suit the Hong Kong setting beyond an admittedly excellent ripoff of the same hit/dodge combat system that everybody uses now.If you really love the genre, go for it,  I guess. I really don't feel I can recommend it, though.			"

												The king lives. Sleeping Dogs was an out of nowhere hit, carving out it's own niche in the open-world crime genre while rising from the ashes of True Crime. Running both sides of the gauntlet as an undercover cop, SD has cemented a position in my very soul as one of the best games ever. The Definitive Edition brings you the whole experience, packing in it's many, MANY DLC packages, including a few extra stories taking you to fighting tournaments, Jiang-Shi infested streets, & riots on Chinese New Year.If you're new to SD, step up & buy this. High speed car chases, brutal fistfights, a storyline worth giving a damn about, & more than a few odd outfit choices to wear while shoving a gangster's face into an A/C Unit.Buy Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition.

												Things to know: -Some of the content is unveiled once you get to a certain chapter of the story archs. -Most of the exclusive clothing has to be bought from vendors, while some others like the triad enforcer need to be unlocked through the exclusive missions. -The exclusive weapons are unlocked as you unlock the exclusive clothing, sometimes they are already in your gear, or are just sitting about at your safehouse.  Thoughts: This edition to the true crime series realy means definitive as it says in the title. You not only get cosmetics such as clothing, but you get two other story lines bundled with it, extra side missions, new weapons, new fighting styles to be unlocked in zodiac tournamentm,and more. Even if you don't think cosmetics have a use, the cosmetic items featured here have several unique benifit such as, increased damage, different fighting style, upped damage, farther hijacking range, etc. If you liked the original sleeping dogs you will love this version. Experience the definitive version now while it's still on sale.			"

												Better than GTA!*runs for cover*I do like how instead of just lumping all the DLC in from the start, they intergrated it into the story to warrent another playthrough of the ""Definitive Edition"" with DLC missions scattered throughout the actual story, and the costumes and cars being unlocked, or being able to be brought from venders. Thoroughly enjoying revisiting Hong Kong again and again, this time with slightly pretty graphics.			"

												Este juego es extremadamente bueno. No voy a hacer un review extenso sobre sus PRO y CONS por que simplemente no tengo tiempo. Im too busy playing the game hahahaEn este juego , tu eres WQei Shen, un policía infiltrado encuwbierto en el mundo de las Triadas de Hong Kong.El setting thel juego es inmersivo, la historia está muy bien llevada. Los personajes tienen caracter propio, los detalles esteticos de la ropa que Wei Shen (el personaje principal) puede tener es entretenida y tematica. mas de algun guiño haciendo referencia a otros clasicos ligados a las Artes Marciales. El humor es atractivo y las misiones son versatiles y requieren de un monton de minipuzzles en algunos casos....Lo mejorpor lejos, son lso combates a mano descubierta.el melee en este juego está muy bien logrado y las habilidades y mecanicas de combate hacen del juego extremadamente entretenido.faltan muchos pequeños detalles que enriquecerian aun mas la aventura de jugar en esta ciudad pero para un juego con ya tantas cosas por hacer, seria pedirle ser perfecto.los graficos del juego son hermosos. reflejos, niebla, las luces de hongkong de noche ...en medio de una lluvia... una pelea de esquina contra las triadas rivales, cuerpo a cuerpo, cojes el cuchillo, lo rompes en una serie de golpes letales contra un contrincante, sigues con una combinacion de patadas, saltas sobre otro enemigo, lo tiras a piso para darle el golpe final, pero ya te estan golpeando y debes bloquear desviando los golpes.no jugar este juego, aun que sea la campaña y sus misiones, es perderse el mejor referente estilo GTA que se ha creado hasta ahora.....espero ver mas de esta maravilla de juego, en una segunda version. SleepingDogs 2. Why not :)			"

Hundreds of deadly                laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing                the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way                through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are                old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His                face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.                Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of                human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic                surface of an Art Deco design.               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.                                     THREEPIO                         Did you hear that? They've shut down                          the main reactor. We'll be destroyed                          for sure. This is madness!               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in                the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.                                     THREEPIO                         We're doomed!               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that                only another robot could understand.                                     THREEPIO                         There'll be no escape for the Princess                          this time.               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as                loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment                are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.                                     THREEPIO                         What's that?               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade                Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the                underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a                tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and                a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make                their way into the smoke-filled corridor.               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with                laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns                creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck                behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers                who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered                arms and faces.               An explosion hits near the robots.                                     THREEPIO                         I should have known better than to                          trust the logic of a half-sized                          thermocapsulary dehousing assister...               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages                around the two hapless robots.               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.                The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone                figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations                who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy                hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable                lad with a prize-winning smile.               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a                large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the                desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided                by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot                appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.                 A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and                he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his                utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying                the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired                Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet                above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the                tiny robot to follow him.                                     LUKE                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you                          waiting for?! Get in gear!               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and                smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his                arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps                into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum                madly.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his                way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is                Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured                by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which                stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the                Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away                from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through                the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run                in a frenzied panic.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.                 Artoo makes beeping sounds.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is                nowhere in sight. The piti			"

												I don't know if the problem occurs for everyone else, but the game has a terrible camera. I don't own an XBOX controller so  I can't see if playing with one fixes the issue, but otherwise the game looks good and WAS fun on the PS3 when I first played it. I can't say I don't recommend the game it's just that the camera is insanely annoying.			"

												Now, this game isnt really that special actually, this kinda like a GTA 5 ""copy cat"". But i felt that this game was enjoyable and decided to do a review on it. To start of, the game has a 'ok' storyline. This is featured in Hong Kong where the triadsrule and destroy each other for fame and territory. The main character in this game is a male named wei shen, you are a undercover cop and your mission is to aid the police team i capturing the triads. In my honest opinion, the game had a bad start, it didnt tell you what really had happened and then you are suddenly caught by the police. After jail he came out and became a cop or did he even went to jail? nvm... Although the stroyline was bad, the rest was pretty fun. It even managed my self to feel sad for one incident during thr game. Now comes the bad stuff, the game has NO MULTIPLAYER!! WHY?I have no idea, but this game could have gotten a 9/10 easily with multiplayer. But for now it is a solid 8/10.			"

												Este juego es extremadamente bueno. No voy a hacer un review extenso sobre sus PRO y CONS por que simplemente no tengo tiempo. Im too busy playing the game hahahaEn este juego , tu eres WQei Shen, un policía infiltrado encuwbierto en el mundo de las Triadas de Hong Kong.El setting thel juego es inmersivo, la historia está muy bien llevada. Los personajes tienen caracter propio, los detalles esteticos de la ropa que Wei Shen (el personaje principal) puede tener es entretenida y tematica. mas de algun guiño haciendo referencia a otros clasicos ligados a las Artes Marciales. El humor es atractivo y las misiones son versatiles y requieren de un monton de minipuzzles en algunos casos....Lo mejorpor lejos, son lso combates a mano descubierta.el melee en este juego está muy bien logrado y las habilidades y mecanicas de combate hacen del juego extremadamente entretenido.faltan muchos pequeños detalles que enriquecerian aun mas la aventura de jugar en esta ciudad pero para un juego con ya tantas cosas por hacer, seria pedirle ser perfecto.los graficos del juego son hermosos. reflejos, niebla, las luces de hongkong de noche ...en medio de una lluvia... una pelea de esquina contra las triadas rivales, cuerpo a cuerpo, cojes el cuchillo, lo rompes en una serie de golpes letales contra un contrincante, sigues con una combinacion de patadas, saltas sobre otro enemigo, lo tiras a piso para darle el golpe final, pero ya te estan golpeando y debes bloquear desviando los golpes.no jugar este juego, aun que sea la campaña y sus misiones, es perderse el mejor referente estilo GTA que se ha creado hasta ahora.....espero ver mas de esta maravilla de juego, en una segunda version. SleepingDogs 2. Why not :)			"

												Played for a little bit, kind of skeptical on the game. I hadn't heard of it before, but it was on sale. But once you get into the game, dear god. The gameplay is great, the fighting mechanics are easy to learn but hard to get down. The story is amazing, and the sheer amount of Pop culture references are great.

												STAR WARS                                        Episode IV                                        A NEW HOPE                                         From the                                  JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS                                            by                                       George Lucas                                   Revised Fourth Draft                                     January 15, 1976                                      LUCASFILM LTD.                A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...               A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.                War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls                into infinity.                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,                     striking from a hidden base, have won their first                     victory against the evil Galactic Empire.                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal                     secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the                     Death Star, an armored space station with enough                     power to destroy an entire planet.                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess                     Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of                     the stolen plans that can save her people and                     restore freedom to the galaxy...               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total                eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny                silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers                from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed                by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly                laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing                the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way                through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are                old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His                face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.                Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of                human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic                surface of an Art Deco design.               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.                                     THREEPIO                         Did you hear that? They've shut down                          the main reactor. We'll be destroyed                          for sure. This is madness!               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in                the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.                                     THREEPIO                         We're doomed!               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that                only another robot could understand.                                     THREEPIO                         There'll be no escape for the Princess                          this time.               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as                loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment                are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.                                     THREEPIO                         What's that?               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade                Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the                underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a                tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and                a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make                their way into the smoke-filled corridor.               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with                laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns                creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck                behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers                who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered                arms and faces.               An explosion hits near the robots.                                     THREEPIO                         I should have known better than to                          trust the logic of a half-sized                          thermocapsulary dehousing assister...               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages                around the two hapless robots.               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.                The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone                figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations                who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy                hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable                lad with a prize-winning smile.               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a                large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the                desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided                by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot                appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.                 A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and                he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his                utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying                the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired                Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet                above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the                tiny robot to follow him.                                     LUKE                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you                          waiting for?! Get in gear!               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and                smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his                arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps                into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum                madly.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his                way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is                Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured                by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which                stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the                Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away                from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through                the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run                in a frenzied panic.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.                 Artoo makes beeping sounds.               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is                nowhere in sight. The piti			"

I will tell you my experienceIts an awesome game, im yet to finish it but i didnt encounter bugs as some people said. For a time my game was constantly crashing but it had something to do with windows touch service or something like that so i disabled it and no issue left. The atmoshpere is great, story is good, gameplay is slighty repeatitive but since it has lots of side missions and story is insteresting with with ups and downs it covers up for that and doesnt feel like that at all.Overall its great and definitely worth a buy.

The car driving is a bit different from GTA because you can ram into other peoples car with the shift key, The car's steering wheel is also on the right side of the car instead of the left			"

It may hang after 15 minutes sometimes, sometimes after 30 minutes. I have updated graphics dirvers, etc. Still same problem. My specs are: AMD FX 4100 3.6 GHZ  processor, 12 GB Ram, Radeon 7700 series graphic card, Windows 64 bit.Also add on DLC is not that much fun.			"

												After completeing the game, and seeing the credits roll, i knew i was satisfied. This game was amazing! Tons of action, interesting characters, and a world full of things to do. Sure it's not as big as GTAV, but to me i enjoyed the gameplay more.. At least when it came to combat. Far more fluid, and complex. Playing almost all events, missions, and such made me wish it would never end. Great soundtrack too, and really works well with the game. If you want an action packed open world game where you have an enourmous amounts of things to do, this is the game for you. The only con i can say is that some of the side missions were reptitive, and not varied enough, but still fun.			"

												Very enjoyable game.Loved the island tournament bit.Hating the trying to find random events on the city though... they're the one thing that does not appear on your mini map.If you like the idea of an open city and getting it on martial arts style then this is for you.To be honest the only thing that was really annoying for me was leveling up the triad level... it rises so slowly that you end up having to replay missions to be able to get it to the max.

												Nice crime game set in Hong Kong. This game looks like it's set in the 80 or 90 century of Hong Kong which is very traditional. I am very happy i have bought this game. It looks unique and the combat is really good. Recommend buy it.			"

												Very enjoyable game.Loved the island tournament bit.Hating the trying to find random events on the city though... they're the one thing that does not appear on your mini map.If you like the idea of an open city and getting it on martial arts style then this is for you.To be honest the only thing that was really annoying for me was leveling up the triad level... it rises so slowly that you end up having to replay missions to be able to get it to the max.

												Definitive Edition has a busier environment, but some of the graphical eye candy has been toned down. (No lens flare etc...)  It's a good game to experience something set outside the west.  Hong Kong (that's China for all you Americans) is a fascinating place to be the stage for this GTA like game.  Worth playing.  Runs smoothly on high end systems and looks PS4 quality.			"

												Sleeping Dogs is not a terrible game, it got nice graphics (especially when it's raining), a great unarmed fight system, and a properly done interseting setting. So why the negative review? Because the game has 2 big flaws that prevent me to consider this (i completed it without rushing) a truly enjoyable experience:1-The driving mechanincs are bad, the awful and totally unrealistic vehicle handling (and dont get me started on the silly ""ramming"" mechanic) and the ridicolous damage model (cars and motorcicle are almost indistructible, taking huge amount of enemy fire or crashing at 250 km/h on concrete wall without consequences, but then you got one bullet on the tire and your car immediately explode in huge fireball for some reason). That's particulary annoying considering this game has A LOT of driving related mission, and games with much less focus on those like Mafia 2 or even L.A. Noire did an incredible better job when it comes to driving.2-The story (the last part in particular). The story actually starts off very interesting, and it remain so for the first half of so, they truly manage to get the player the impression of Wei's conflicting loyalities, you also get a nice unexpected shock moment that makes things even more interesting but from that moment to end, the story become one of the most predictable and boring i've seen in a while. You know when a crime or thriller movie, seems so much predicatable and obvious you are sure that there is going to be some huge plot twist near the end? Well this game second half of the story gives exactly that same impression, but in the end you get no plot twist and everything turns out to be exactly as lame as it seemed to be. Your friend that got huge deathflags all over himself actaully die, the bad and unlikable superior actually turn out to be stupid, and corrupt, the characters that are reasonable and nice to you, turn out to be really good people, they also get the happy ending to make it more clear, in the end, extremely disappointing. Also your enemies are some of the most uniteresting and flat characters i've seen in while,""huh watch me i'm so violent and evil just for the sake of it!!!! i'm also stupid and short sighted (but somehow i became the most powerfull and respected Triad boss of Hong Kong) I'm such a bad guy!!!! do you hate me already???""In the end this game got quite some nice aspects to it, but, if you are not fan of the setting (that's actually very nicely done) i'd say there far superior alternatives when it comes to this genre (especially if you are looking for a good story-driven title, coughMafia2cough) that are much more worthy of your time.

												Absolutely loved the original, this version of it contains all the DLC and runs better while looking nicer, if you're a fan of open-world games with good stories I'd buy this one, it's a great game to get into.The vehicle handling is pretty nice, the ability to slam is still amusing to me.Fighting is still awesome, it feels really fluid and well made.The ability to change your clothing to both regular (Full outfits giving bonuses) and the 'Legendary' Outfits (Which are the ones that come with all the DLC), it makes for some extra fun of mixing up the combat. (Having unique weapons that come with the outfit, vehicles that are bought with the outfit, damage reductions, damage bonuses, that sort of thing)Also the pricetag is great, it's well worth £19.99			"

												It could be such a fun game, it really could.But the terrible mouse and keyboard controls, the frustrating fights that have to be repeated several times until you can beat them and the chases, where you have to take out millions of cars and motorcycles that come after you really take the fun away. Or when you are nearly unable to chase down an old truck on a motorcycle, and you barely can catch up to it. But later in the game, when you drive the truck, it is so slow every other vehicle could overtake you... well, WHY?!?I like the characters and the story, but after the tenth time a guy runs away and you have to chase him down and beat the crap out of him and his friends, it really gets old really fast.Oh, and attempting to DRIVE away from the cops? A near impossibility. Much easier to just ram them out of the way.TLDR: It had so much potential, but overall it is a frustrating mess.			"

												Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like ""kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times"" or ""I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found"", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. ""lalala... driving along the road..."" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their ""elite team"" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to ""lunge"" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the ""new and improved"" sleeping dogs would be ""new and improved"" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a ""small adventure"" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.			"

												Having never played the original despite owning it, I found that getting the Definitive Edition with its enhancements and all the DLC to be a rather good investment. it certainly worked out cheaper than buying all the DLC on their own.My first impression video goes through the graphics performance, improvements, and gameplay.


YouTube™ Video: Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition - High Def Doge 2160p 

			Views: 562		

			NEW Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition is out on Steam. Let's see what it's like shall we, all in 2160p. Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Get the Game ...		

Given that I have been thoroughly enjoying the game, and the graphical improvement are extremely good. Especially the new density improvements making mini Hong Kong come alive and bustle with crowds.Performance is good, although sadly so far AMD Crossfire doesn't seem to be working for me. Even so even with a single card, the game can easily be maxed out at 3440x1440 with AA set to Normal aka FXAA. I have not seen any improvement using the high AA settings at my resolution.Word of warning though, if you use an Ultrawide monitor or multimonitor setup, all cinematics are rendered in 16:9. Resulting in pillar boxing.None of which detracts from the game, and it is very good. The story is compelling, and there is a variety of sub missions, and favours which can be done. There is a small RPG element, allowing you to visually customise your character via unlocking or buying new clothing. Along with upgrading skills. Which are in three main categories. Police, Triad, and Martial arts.They all complement each other, and levels are gain in each by doing their respective faction's missions.If you already own the original and enjoyed it, but you're missing the DLC and want those. The Upgrade cost to the new version is easily worthwhile, and you gain the new improvements with it.For new players I would happily recommend this as a sandbox action game, with a very good story, and great gameplay.

My only problem with this game is it is a little too short with a little over 10 hours for me and the cliff hanger didnt satisfy me I wanted to know what would happen afterwords (heres to hoping they make sleeping dogs 2 one day).All together I think if you havent played the orginal version of this game then its a must have.9/10			"

												Clunky combat system and mechanics, when having to tap a key they want you to do it at such a specific rythm that it often gets very frustrating. I would say the programming could be better, more flexible and fluid.Still fun to play thoughWould recommend if you like combat systems and beating up bad guysWould not recommend if you don't like annoying controlsOn another note, I question the developer's choice to make you pres V repeatedly on the scaffolding, I've spammed the key and I still fall and die.

												I finished this game and the dlc so this game isn't that bad since I finished it in a week time. However, appart from the decent graphics and sound the game itself is very repetitive.  After an hour of two you pretty much seen everything. And even the graphics aren't that ""wow"". Only a few car/people models, repetitive appartment blocks, ... Combat is just clicking the left button and avoiding incoming attacks. Yes you can learn new moves but at the end I just ended with the left mouse button smashing as that seemed to work as well. I've also encountered some bugs. Thought this was the Definitive Edtion (polished version) but they didn't even bothered to add an option to remap the radio. Since I'm an arrow key player I was forced to use awsd for driving cause the radio was mapped on the arrows. Missions are boring (maybe it's because I finished GTA 5 before playing this one) but missions are just average. The side quest are even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ appart from the racing which was cool. Hard to understand that this game got an average of 8/10. A 6/10 should be maximum this game should receive. Despite the decent graphics and sound, this is a pretty repetitive, bugged boring game that I won't start up anymore. After finishing the main quest, there's nothing really to see/do compared with a GTA.			"

												While I've heard great things about this game, and I'm sure the gameplay is pretty good, I was unable to enjoy this game as it is very poorly optimized for how it looks. With an i5 6600K, a GTX 1070, and 16 GB of RAM, I get 35-55 fps in 1440p with all setting maxed out. Turning the settings down gives me an increase of 15-20 fps. While these are playable framerates for most, I have gotten pretty used to 80-150 fps with most recent AAA games so when the game drops below 45-50, it gives me a headache and makes the game unplayable for me. And considering how the game looks, I should be getting a much higher framerate. Overwatch at a mix of Ultra and Epic settings gives me 130-160 fps in 1440p. GTA V with everything but MSAA and Grass maxed out and no soft shadows gives me 110-130 fps in 1440p. Battlefield 1 with everything maxed out gives me 70-85 fps in 1440p. And those three games look a lot better than this game, though Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition does look pretty good for a remaster from 2014 for a game from 2012. I noticed that this seems to be a common issue, with people with GTX 1060s struggling to get 40 fps in 1080p. And I heard that the original with a free texture pack released by the developer to make the two games look identical performs much better than this game, so it's obviously just a poorly optimized game. Even if you can get a playable framerate like I was able to, vote with your wallet and don't support these practices or they will continue!			"

												Bought it based on positive reviews very disappointed and requested a refund. Very shallow gameplay - a bit like a poor mans gta...the combat is very much like batmans but more reliant on pressing keys / buttons at right times ie to counter enemy highlights when you have to press the key......I didnt find the combat very good - its very well consoley......and it is not as good as batmans or anywhere near as good as shadow of mordors which are the only other titles i can think of at moment with this sort of combat in. I think the main issue is all the little things that spoil this game for me - such as you crash into a car on the  road - nothing happens...they just drive on - the traffic feels like its on rails and whatever you do doesnt have much impact like it does in gta so no feeling of immersion.  Also this relates to the people that populate the game - you can shove them and not get a reaction so they dont feel real.   I threw a man threw a window and he died and no one did anything.....I kind of felt like i was in the matrix and no one could see me or anything I did if that makes sense....hmm.I think gaming has moved on now to the point where we are used to living breathing worlds so I think games like this dont age to well.  To be fair played it for 1 hour and gave up as I was totally bored and have requested a refund...if you play it for less  than 2 hours you can request a refund so try it if your not sure......			"

												The game is great but it has one huge flaw: the counter mechanic is completely broken.The character just doesn't respond to my command when I want to counter an attack.I played this when it first came out and there were no issues so it must be related to something they changed in the Definitive Edition.

												Really a great game, with a great story, nice action and freedom in chosing which missions to make, but the game has a great flaw. At least it has on my pc and I never experience any problems in my other games.The camera angles freeze quite often.I have tried disabling effects, running the game with only 1 monitor, disabling overlay, but no matter what, you can be playing the game for a while and then suddenly the camera movement gets stuck, which leaves you with no other option, than to restart the game. This is really annoying, and to me, it ruins the game experience.			"

I've tried every single fix I found on google and believe me there are a lot of them as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people are having the same issues as I am. I would've probably recommended this game IF I was able to play it but as it stands I can't recommend this game to anyone and I'm now off to get a refund.			"

												Sleeping Dogs was, is and always will be one of my favorite games. Before I review, note that the description is lying. It doesn't include all availaible DLC's. But it does include two major ones. So you're probably wondering whether Sleeping Dogs has anything to do with sleeping dogs. Nope. Just like Watch_Dogs has nothing to do with watching dogs. It might be a tad boring that way. Just a tad. You play as an undercover cop named Wei Shen who's job and goal is to take down the notorious Triad Sun On Yee gang in Hong Kong. The story plays out really well and characters have good voice acting and are memorable.If you haven't played the original (which is unfortunately not available anymore on PC) you wouldn't notice the difference in graphics. The only two noticeable changes I saw is the lighting and amount of people on the streets; which already makes for a much more fun experience as it makes Hong Kong feel much more alive. There are some minor annoyances but nothing game breaking. Cars and motorcycles pinball off of walls and other cars and sometimes combos and counters don't register. But it doesn't happen often. I very highly recommend this game as it delivers unique combat on foot and in cars. Which reminds me....to those of you patiently waiting for Arkham Knight, this will fill the whole for a bit as you can unlock (basically) the Chinese Batmobile. It will gain upgrades as you do more missions with it.That's the end of my review. This paragraph is for those curious to gain knowledge past playing the game. Sleeping Dogs is based on true events. How true? That I don't know but I do know this. The fictious Sun On Yee gang is based on a real Triad gang called the Sun Yee On. And the 18K is based on the Sun Yee On's real arch rivals the 14K. Sun Yee On was founded in 1919 by a man named Heung Chin and currently has around 55,000 members around the world; which is supposedly the highest count among the Triads. The Triads control extortion, drug trafficking, gambling and prostitution. Which is basically everything you encounter in the game. Their favored weapon of choice is the cleaver; which you see plenty of in the game as well. The Triads do not give any mercy to traitors and rats. They do indeed torture their victims before killing them. The term 'red pole' is also a real term used and is actually not a huge deal within their structure. 'Red poles' are enforcers; just one step up from being regular members. Before you were even in the Sun On Yee you were considered a 'Blue Lantern' which is the uninitiated. The initiated and regular members are considered '49ers'. The characters you see in the game are based off of actual people; but the names were changed to protect them. There is also a reason why Wei Shen came from San Francisco. The Triads were really noticed by the US in 1977 due to the ""Golden Dragon Massacre"". The attack resulted in 5 deaths and 11 wounded. 2 of which were tourists and the other 9 weren't gang members either. This event led to the creation of the 'San Francisco Asian Gang Task Force'. People usually tend to think that videogames aren't educational and they teach you absolutely nothing. This is....the definitive way to prove those people wrong AHAHA....I'm sorry I couldn't resist. Now go enjoy being a sleeping dog for (San's) sake!			"

												This game is... well it is an open world game. If you are looking for a gripping story that is AAA quality then do not expect it here. If you want something that you can grip some time into then this game is alright. To be honest this is not the best game but an average game. It does everything well but not to the standards I was expecting. If you find this review and the game is around 90% discount then I would say it is one to consider. However at 32,99 CAN I would not recommend a buy. The fighting is ok at best, the story feels like it could of been so much better, and finally the extra content does not really add anything new to the game (besides more tedious bosses). I feel that this genra should be tried again, a kung fu epic open world game sounds really awesome, it just needs to love and care that it deserves.			"

												i normally don't write reviews but this version is terrible. i love this game so i bought both versions thinking that the Definitive Edition would be so much better but it's worst. the regular version had HD textures but it's gone now. In Definitive version all the faces look the same and undistinguishable unlike the previous regular version where they faces look like HK actor and actresses. maybe they got a lawsuit or something for making the characters look like HK actors and they didn't want to pay them. For example one of the shop keepers looked like Power Chan now he doesn't even look like him. This is a great game but I wouldn't buy this version. and thanks for taking away the HD texture pack away from the regular version. buy the regular version if you can find it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but the unique setting and premise couldn't make up for the large number of game design flaws I encountered during my playthrough:The Good:-Cool setting and well designed game world.-Decent story-Ai is surprisingly intelligent during shootouts and will always either be in cover or moving from cover to cover to flank you.The Bad:-Vehicle handling is awful, ESPECIALLY motorcycles. The vehicles in general feel very stiff, it felt like I was driving in a bad PS2 game.-The camera seems to have a mind of its own and will often put up a fight when your trying to move it around, the problem is much worse when driving.-Gunplay in the game is poor with only a handful of generic firearms to choose from with lackluster handling.-The hand to hand combat, which makes up about 80% of the combat in this game, is mediocre at best(think Arkham games but much more repetitive and not nearly as smooth).-Side missions can sometimes glitch out leaving them impossible to complete, I was unable to finish all the side missions due to this problem.-The in-game radio has the worst selection of music I've ever encountered in an open world game. but this point is really just a matter of opinion.

												Combat was very frustrating.  Missions were very repetative and heavily scripted.  If you had a foot chase and managed to get ahead of the guy it didn't matter, you couldn't touch him until you reached the destination where his friends were.  Car chases were equally frustrating.  Even with the DLC super car with enhanced speed bad guys could out run me in a straight-away until the script told them it was time for me to catch up.Frustrating, anoying and repetative.  Not fun at all.  Hell, the women you meet have 1 mission each to unlock items on your map and then you never see them again!  Not recomended.			"

												I have to tell you that I love Sleeping Dogs, the game is nothing less than amazing. I had hundreds of hrs of gameplay in Sleeping Dogs (vanilla non-steam). This is a review on the definitve edition of the game and not the game itself. After having played both the versions, I can say that the Definitive Edition was not necessary at all. Here's why...-Character controls feel even more sloppier now in this game.-It would be a lie to say that they fixed all the bugs and glitches that were present in the original  Sleeping Dogs.-Very little noticeable changes in terms of graphics and textures, almost everything seems same as before. -It's so freakin' bright, especially indoors during the daytime, so much that I feel like I am gonna get a migraine attack.-The vehicle controls in races are terrible in the definitve edition. The opponents in the bike races will try to push you off the track everytime you try to cut them off which I don't recall having experienced before. -You don't get the all black attire you got in the last mission of the original game which was later a part of the High Roller DLC pack so that players can have access to it from the beginning of the story. It's not there anymore :(  instead you get a gray suit. Seriously, what asian gangster doesn't own a black suit, it's almost their trademark, don't you think?I don't see the point in spending more money for the very little graphical improvements and I cannot recommend gamers who have already played Sleeping Dogs to go ahead and buy the Definitive edition. If you never played the game before, then do buy it, you will rarely come across an open world game with such a great story. Try getting the original version + all DLC's from steam game key seller sites.			"

IT's even buggier and glitchier then the original release, and people who owned the original were still charged full price for this ""definitively worse edition"".			"

												I can't say I'm surprised that Square Enix made a good RPG yet again, but what I am surprised is how fun they made an RPG with the source material that this game is based on.  In Sleeping Dogs, you are an undercover agent in some asian city posing as someone trying to get into the Triads.  The story goes pretty stereotypically from there based on the Triad background, but it is so fun along the way.The world size is pretty big, and the amount of things to do is pretty fun.  I will also applaud the game for the focus on hand-to-hand combat mechanics rather than gun-play, as it makes it much more interesting most of the time.  The graphics are really great, and the characters are voiced well, and have very good backstories and development for the most part.  The driving is even done pretty damn well.Overall the game is up there alongside a lot of other RPG's in it's class and holds it's own really well, given it's good execution and really, really unique setting and story for a RPG.

												I honestly dont know this game got a ""Mostly Postive"" rating, as this has been the most frustrating gaming expierence i have had since Dark Souls. The driving feels like they made the moped and then copy/pasted it for the rest of it, the shooting is just awkard and clunky, it auto aims if you are close but if you are even slightly farther away then 5 feet it just doesnt work. The combat system responds on a 3 second delay and it makes missions where you fight more then 8 people (happens quite often) replay heavy and frustrating. One of the worst games ive played. Story is okay tho, not branching like it lets on but it was the only thing that kept me interested.			"

If you want to get a console port, do yourself a favour, buy this game, you'll undoubtedly enjoy it, think it's incredibly stunning and get sucked into the Asian shenanigans of Wei - whilst probably looking for hookers as if it's GTA. If you DON'T want a console port, AVOID THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THIS ♥♥♥♥♥. It is so bad it's unreal.

												Game looks good, I didnt get far in.Key re-mapping is a nightmare and dosent always work. When it does work sometimes it re-maps itself back to default.Audio had 1 huge problem, the music audio/car music audio is always at 10. Anythime I change it to anything else within a minute both volumes are at 10 again. Was going to just live with game music and turn the car radio to an empty station or off. I use the arrow keys to move/drive. The arrow keys left and right change the radio station....and theres no way to unbind or re-map them(that I found in options). I've tried re-installing with no luck.Kinda sad, this game looked very cool and before I got in a vehicle I thought the story was looking good and so was the gameplay. After getting into a vehicle and not being able to turn off a volume 10 radio and changing the station everytime I steer left or right killed this game for me.			"

I keep coming back to give it another go, but I think I have now learnt that when their is no hope left for this game, their is no hope...This is not ""funny/ fun"" types of glitches, they are annoying glitches that would interfere with your game.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! IT's NOT WORTH THE PRICE!Great idea, poorly executed.

												I love Sleeping Dogs. It is one of my all time favorite video games ever. I still play it regularly.I personally can't recommend Definitive Edition because it would not launch on my computer. I always got a white screen and an error message. I tried a number of things to get it working, but ultimately I got my money back (thank you Steam) because I feel I shouldn't have to reformat my whole computer to launch one game. I also felt weird about buying the first game and all the DLC, then being told to buy it all again in a nice little package.It's sad to think some people might not be able to play this, AND you can no longer buy the original. Otherwise I'd 100% recommend that anyone who also can't launch Definitive Edition get a refund then go buy the original release. Honestly, if you can't launch this, please go on eBay and find a physical copy of the original because I cannot recommend the actual game enough!			"

												It's a great game and all, and it does many things better than Grand Theft Auto V, including the amazing melee combat system. That doesn't mean I like this game, though.This game's a horrible PC port.Pros:- Fantastic melee combat system.- You're playing as a cop. (Or is that a con? I guess neither. At least it's different than GTA V.)- Longer story than GTA V.- Voice lines that does not have at least one n-word in every single sentence.- Great voice acting.Cons:- Annoying mouse acceleration that you can't switch off.- You have to hold a keyboard key rather than just press it to be able for the game to recognize that you're pressing it.- You can't change controls.- Limited graphics settings. You can't even turn VSync off. - Takes long to exit a motorcycle because you have to take your helmet off first.- It's really hard to get any weapons. To get a gun, you have to find one hidden across the map, or kill a police officer.I've played this game for a little over four hours. I think Grand Theft Auto V is much better, but a few aspects of this game are amazing and much better than what GTA V has to offer.Although, there are too many cons to really like this game. I only bought it because it was on sale.It looked good from all the positive reviews, but then after I bought the game, I saw that many people had similar problems as me.It's a good game, but not a great game.It could do so much better.

												GameplaySleeping dogs is a cross between mortal kombat and gta 5 so I’m just going to refer to it as street fighter for that very reason. The driving in street fighter is decent but I’m not completely sure the developers had a firm grasp on how cars work. Because every time you  shoot someone's tire out the car the car does its best interpretation ballerina on her period. And by that I mean It spins out of control and explodes; But I digress, the combat, the beef of the game, is similar to the batman arkham asylum. You have a heavy attack, a light attack, and stringing either of them together randomly can lead to combo finisher. You also have a counter block, and a grab. The developers of street fighter were also kind enough to litter pretty much every section of the game with baddies and various hazards to throw them into. Wood chippers, phone booths, unsuspecting bystanders, and much much more.Story: You play Wei shen whose name in English basically means “why” and if the source which I received that information from is to be trusted I’m pretty sure the developers knew that we were going to have a lot of “why” related questions by the end of the story. The biggest ones being why is Wei able to walk away with no negative repercussions after the main story-line at that point He’s directly responsible for the deaths of about 50 people. The second why related question is. What the ♥♥♥♥ happened in america. Cops aren’t trained to airjack cars, and defy the laws of physics….Anyway moving on.Early in the game you find out that you’re not a gangster and are instead an undercover police officer. Which was the only interesting thing I can say about the story  Okay I think I'm done here.8/10would play again.			"

												Kinda bummed out about this game. And at myself. The game is really good, but for a more casual gamer like me. I find it difficult early on to be able to fight so many people at the same time without dying. I. have been stuck on a mission to rob some guys for ages. I've come close a few times. But the amount of times it takes me to get even close, puts me off the rest of the game. As if so difficult now. I'm not going to stand a chance further in. Not a GTA fan, so was hoping to get a grittier,more realistic, less pimp/gangster vibe. Shame, as I like it. But Mafia 2 is more for me atm. And I'd like to get WD 2. If you are one of those annoying people that are good at all games. It's worth it. Be a good challenge. For me. Too darn hard :-(			"

												The key mapping for this is very different than typical FPS. It's horrid.Even worse, when getting into a screen to buy clothing there's no way to go back without purchasing. On top of that, when you zoom in, you can't zoom back out. The key to zoom out is shown as the left arrow, but the left arrow key just rotates the guy. So, then you force quit the game because no key will do anything but rotate the guy.Look under options to change the key mapping and find out you can't change any relevant keys. WTF.Maybe with a game controller it works. The game looks like it has great potential, but with just keyboard and mouse it's pure dung.			"

												Wanted so hard to like this game, just couldn't.  If you want to shoot people, don't play this game.  Very hand to hand.The game moved WAY too slow for me and with nothing but fists (and the only way to gain new moves is by finding statues  scattered throughout and returning them) it got extremely boring and repetative.  Missing after mission just feels like:: Guy A is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at Guy B, go beat up 6 - 10 of Guy B's dudes, mission over.   "

												A game that makes you wish you were playing Grand Theft Auto. The combat is sluggish and repetitive; if you weren't sick of fighting twelve identical bald guys, here's five more! The camera when driving can be somewhat nausea inducing: I found the camera spinning every time I tried to reverse out of a tight space. And, unlike other Sandbox Crime games, you cant push the right analogue stick to get a better view over the top of your car, a real problem on a hill. Shame, it's a nice concept, with some really great voice acting, marred by shoddy game mechanics, and a moral 'choice' system guarenteed to get on your nerves.  As the True Crime franchise goes, it is by far the best one - the fact you can play more than a third of the game if you even think about hitting a pedestrian springs to mind. There are some really fun aspects: one or two of the side missions were quite fun, driving on the left really throws you, it can be varied when it wants to be. But a lot of what it offers has now been done better.			"

												Can't really tell you how the game is. . .BECAUSE I CAN'T PLAY IT! Seriously steam or whoever the developer of this game is. When I load up the game, there's an  ""Executable has stopped working"" message that prevents me from playing the game EVERY TIME. I've tried every possible solution that the internet has provided but it still hasn't worked. I've even contacted steam  to which they just regurgitated solutions that I've already tried. After suggesting two ways I could fix the error, they closed my question even though I told them it didn't work. It just pisses me off that I wasted money on a game I may never get to play. It's ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. Screw it, I'm blacklisting this publisher and I'm never buying from them again. Also steam, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together. Either have an answer that fixes the problem or refund my money. It's things like this that makes me go back to consoles.			"

Posted: February 8, 2015
												This game is made by a bunch of assclowns. I have absolutely no idea why it is so highly reviewed everywhere I look.Lets start with the pros:-Game world is gorgeous.-Unlike boring♥♥♥♥♥GTA games, Hong Kong is set in a vibrant exotic city (unless you're from Hong Kong of course) but with the same ""lets all be criminals gimmick"" (except this time you're an undercover cop)-Story seems to be great and the game immerses you quite nicely alot of times.-Driving a fast car at night in HK..particularly if it is raining is something spectacular.Here are the cons:-Completely game breaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics....particularly when it comes to the fighting. (The thing you will spend 95% of your time doing in Sleeping Dogs). It is the same mechanic that the Batman Arkham and Assasins Creed games employ. But where those games don't fail at the whole ""Click button to counter"" thing...this game does....by the♥♥♥♥♥♥tons. The problem is simple -> The game simply does not reccognize inputs. Example 1: I click a bunch to regular attack. Some taps some hold for power attacks. I see a guy shine red (which signals I need to counter) so I press the counter button. My guy continues to regular attack...gets hit....then continues to regular attack...and continues to regular attack (I have not even touched my mouse for the past 3 seconds now) and the game literally beeps at me. (It is the a similar noise to the sticky keys noise...but it is not sticky keys and shift was not ONCE pressed). This is an issue that there ARE forum posts about. Most♥♥♥♥♥♥♥will come back with ""DERPAHERP ISH THE SCHTICKY KEYZ"" (It is not. And may those subhumans die in a glorious cleansing fire) Example 2: ""Fix"" problem by enabling ""double click"" to fast under my mouse settings...apparently the game couldnt take that many inputs and literally♥♥♥♥♥♥itself and died. STILL however I notice pressing the counter button at times...and Wei (the character you play) will literally NOT do that...get hit, and THEN (once again...have not even TOUCHED my mouse for the past 3 seconds) will do a ""counter stance"". That counter stance is what happens when you press counter with zero attacks coming at you. So breaking this down...the game cannot handle inputs...unless at a delay sometimes. I don't know if it is because it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port (and may all consoles and console games burn in hell eternally so the master PC race can finally enjoy some non-crap video games), or if the game is simply coded by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys. This is by far the greatest con as it IS game breaking and pervasive throughout the game, and as such the biggest entry in this review.-Bugs. Lots of them. Lots of buggy bugs. People popping in and out of existance. Npcs getting stuck on nothing (nothing better than having the guy you are chasing get stuck on a corner for literally eternity. I am serious..you can get out of your car and go buy some noodles...he won't move).-Cars for the most part (at the very least the earlier cars that you will spend a whopping 50% of your game time using) will move as if in tar. They move DAMN fast forward, but their turn rate handles as if the parking break was on the entire time...insert asian drivers joke here. I am also suspicious that this may be a part of the ""does not accept input""♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanic of the game.-Ok I get it...it's a fighting game. It's fun to kung fu around...but I have the same issue with this as I did with the arkham games...I don't know how many times i can pound the same group of differently color clothed bad guys (that boil down to 4 archetypes with like 2-3 models each) before the ENTIRE game becomes just a blur of mediocrity. Why? Why do I have to punch every bad guy in this city in the face. That seems like the worst, most obnoxious approach to solving crime in this city. How would that even work? I'm pretty sure by the time I was done, a whole new generation would have been born, and raised into crimedom. You would think its a good thing to just put nonstop action in a game...but it is the equivalent of saying ""oh my god...pineapple is my favorite. I hope I get to eat pineapple for the rest of my life...and only pineapple!"" Guess what...you will literally♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself to death if you do that. -Too many damned fetch quests. Why do I have to increase my health by driving around finding shrines to pray at for 8 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed real life hours. It's just needless padding to gameplay time. Instead of doing that...just make a better game.-Like so many of these games, your actions do not seem to have consequences. You cannot turn a bad guy good or a good guy bad. It doesn't matter who you choose to save...or who you don't. You have no choice. All you can do is punch the same 10 character models in the face until the game ends. And you get to watch a nifty little cutscene movie in between. Not enough of a payoff. Literally every quest boils down to: Go over there and beat that group of 12 guys up.If I had to guess...this game was thought up by a bunch of really smart people. They knew what gamers would want to experience. They hired artists that did a really bangup job of modeling everything. They hired voice actors that did their job very well and immersed you into the world (with the help of great writers). Then they threw the game to the actual coders...the game mechanics makers...the meat and potatoes of the game...and it turns out they were a bunch of mentally challenged lemurs all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves and banging the keyboard with their heads untill a game came out. It's a really bad game. I spent 7.50 when it was on sale...and honestly... it's 6 dolars too expensive.I swear...square enix is such a hit or miss company.I played alot of Sleeping Dogs (original) when it came out... and I only got this definitive edition hoping the gameplay problems were fixed. They were not. All the improvements are window dressing to a barn filled with excrement.			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. It looks fantastic and is another sandbox game, where you can do as you wish.Unfortunately I think the developers spent more time on looks than functionality.Seriously, did anyone actually test driving a car? Sometimes you can't turn at all, other times you turn 90 degress by hitting A or D. It's the most unrealistic driving simulator I've ever played and makes it extremely infuriating to try and play.The fighting seems ridiculous as well. Completely unnatural. Why can't I just punch and kick poeple? Why all the special key combos? It makes no sense.Pros:- Looks beautiful- Sandbox, open concept- Great storylineCons:- Annoying controls (unrealistic and unnatural)- Driving is almost impossible to control- Too many cutscenes- No real sense of what you're next task isIf you can get it cheap and have a lot of patience go for it. Otherwise move on and save your money.			"

												After playing GTA V and Batman Arkham City this poor attempt at combining GTA playstyle and Batman combat system simply sucks. I got the game on sale and I still think I could have found a better use for my money than this.Ccombat is annoying and does not flow like in Batman, most of the time I was looking for ways to avoid it due to overuse of counter attack. So for most hand to hand combat, which is like 90% of the game, I simply got a truck and roadkilled the enemies. Story is somewhat interesting but every single thing revolves around hand to hand combat. Driving camera is bad, and driving model itself is not much better. There is some assasins creed like exploration involved but it is not nearly as good as even the first AC was. Overall this game is a dissapointment, if it either was more GTA like with guns readily available or had a melee combat that worked like Batmans than it could be fun.			"

												FILLING:1/2 teaspoon five-spice powder1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmedCooking spray1 cup thinly sliced green onions3 tablespoons hoisin sauce2 tablespoons rice vinegar1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce1 1/2 teaspoons honey1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger1 teaspoon minced garlic1/4 teaspoon salt1. To prepare the filling, rub five-spice powder evenly over pork. Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat the pan with cooking spray. Add pork to pan; cook 18 minutes or until a thermometer registers 155°, turning pork occasionally. Remove pork from pan, and let stand 15 minutes.2. Cut pork crosswise into thin slices; cut slices into thin strips. Place pork in a medium bowl. Add onions and next 7 ingredients (through 1/4 teaspoon salt); stir well to combine. Cover and refrigerate.3. To prepare dough, combine 1 cup warm water, sugar, and yeast in a large bowl; let stand 5 minutes.4. Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Add flour, oil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to yeast mixture; stir until a soft dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes). Place dough in a large bowl coated with cooking spray, turning to coat top. Cover and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, 1 hour or until doubled in size. (Gently press two fingers into dough. If indentation remains, dough has risen enough.)5. Punch dough down; let rest 5 minutes. Turn dough out onto a clean surface; knead in baking powder. Let dough rest 5 minutes.6. Divide dough into 10 equal portions, forming each into a ball. Working with one dough ball at a time (cover remaining dough balls to keep from drying), roll ball into a 5-inch circle. Place 1/4 cup filling in center of dough circle. Bring up sides to cover filling and meet on top. Pinch and seal closed with a twist. Repeat procedure with remaining dough balls and filling.7. Arrange 5 buns seam side down, 1 inch apart, in each tier of a 2-tiered bamboo steamer. Stack tiers; cover with lid.8. Add water to a large skillet to a depth of 1 inch; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Place steamer in pan; steam 15 minutes or until puffed and set. Cool 10 minutes before serving.			"

												The hand to hand combat is alright, and driving around can be fun, but that's about it.It's easy to see why this game was overlooked; underneath the cool setting, kung fu fighting and decent graphics it's just an inferior GTA pretender.  I don't mean that because it's a crime centered sandbox, I mean that because it takes all of its cues from GTA but does them worse.Almost none of the characters are interesting.  They're introduced and killed at the drop of a hat.  You do about 2-3 missions and watch a couple of cutscenes and you're expected to care for these lifeless gangster stereotypes.The story is disjointed.  You go from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment to a rich flat in a matter of missions, but you're still apparently working for some guy who operates out of his mom's kitchen.  The game even tries its hand at some laughable attempts at romance.  It just throws romance missions at you that grant bonuses, and then those female characters disappear utterly and are never heard from again.  It's like they chucked in unfinished storylines.Gun combat is boring.  It's not as frequent as hand to hand, which is fine since that's the only fun part of the game, but it's all also very easy and unengaging.  Car combat is a JOKE.  If you shoot a single tire a car will suddenly go FLYING into the air.  It's fun the first few times but it's just absurd.  You get chased by 40 enemy bad guys in motorcycles and cars and you blow them all up by shooting out the tires and watching all of them spring up into the air like something out of Bollywood.There's no real clear cut antagonist.  It just switches from some bad guy who ♥♥♥♥ed your sister, to some generic gang that is at war with your triad because... reasons... and then it switches back to the first bad guy's boss.The main character was interesting and I was hoping the whole conflict between Wei being more of a cop or falling back into the gangster lifestyle was going to go some where.  Maybe the triad and cop bars actually affect the story?   But, spoiler alert, it doesn't.The game just ends with a string of cutscenes, like they ran out of budget to add additional missions and they just skip days until the big bad guy who was behind everything the whole time is arrested.  Some cliched dialogue is exchanged and the game is over.It's also really short.  The little side features are dull.  The car with the 2 miniguns is awesome and is one of the few things I really had fun with, but really, most of the time I was playing this I was thinking ""Man, I wish they did so and so feature like GTA instead."" or ""Man, this is a cool set up, I wish GTA 4/5's writers were writing this storyline instead.""After the short 12-14 hour main story, including time to do a bunch of side missions and go on rampages, all this game really did for me is make me want to go and play GTA 4 or 5.There's nothing offensively bad about this game, it's just boring, poorly written, and not really worth the time.

												I love the game and have it on my 360, I was excited to see that the definitive edition could run on my poor GPU (Intel HD 4400) since Intel HD 4000 or higher was recommended. My comp is well above minimum requirements and even on low settings I cannot run it with a decent FPS (I got about 10-15 on low). Thumb down for false advertisement.			"

												I kinda wanted to recommend this game. But sorry, i have controller problems. I used a PS2 Dualshock Joystick connected via USB to my pc. Usually, X360.ce would help you to solve this problem on every ""full controller support games"". When i was in the game, the right trigger button is for pause and all of button is messed up. I found out on the web that everyone have the same problem. No one gave the real solution. This game is kinda enjoyable when i was playing with my keyboard and mouse, but i dont like it. I need to play it on joystick. The tech support might answer your question, but they didn't give you any real solution. I was kinda frustated by this. So if you like GTA-kind games, i'll recommend you this games. But if you wanna play the game with a joystick, hell no. Dont buy this. Just imagine playing FIFA or PES with start button to pass the ball. I'm gonna change my review as if the dev give us the real solution. Maybe a configuration help, or a patch.  "

												Little to no change from the original release. Playing the game at 3840x2160 with maximum available settings, still provides mediocre visual fidelity in contrast to other titles. This title isn't as graphically demanding as it sets itself up to be; it is more the lack or proper PC hardware usage that cripples performance in most scenarios. The gameplay itself is where the core positives come from. A blend of Batman: Arkham series style combat, with a mixture of matial arts donates a hard hitting experience for hand to hand combat. Fire fights take a semi-cinematic path, with slow motion crossovers, and ""on the fly"" environment interaction. The main city area itself has a large amount of content to explore, side missions to take part in, and police objectives to clear. The driving can feel out of place at times if you are in the wrong vehicle, although the action cameras and jumping from car to car provide options for changing that. The Definitive Edition is another way of saying ""DLC."" That is what you get, the original copy of the game with all included DLC. If you are expecting a full ""remaster,"" you will not find it here. Only subtle changes to the graphics have been applied, and more times than not, they are just additional effects to fill the empty spaces of the city. I picked up the game at a massive discount, and I suggest you do as well. As years later, it is not worth anywhere near the full price they are requesting, and feels more like a ""cash grab"" than anything else. Especially with the lackluster improvements to the core elements that make up Sleeping Dogs. If you don't own the game, it is a good time sink between other games. You can't go wrong with a discount purchase.			"

												Graphics? Good. Voice acting? Good. World detail and design? Good. Story? Promising.All in all, the game should be great. I mean, most reviews are overwhelmingly possitive, but I just couldn't enjoy it. The fighting system is unbelievably clunky and dumb, you just punch away at opponents and attempt to react to their attacks in a hit-or-miss game of luck. Your character sometimes even gets kinda dizzy and doesn't react to any of your inputs, making you basically a standing punchbag. If you fail to counter their attacks, there goes a big chunk of your health...which is ridiculous considering you face half a dozen opponents every time. It can get boring VERY quickly. Although a different concept, Shadow Warrior has a massively better combat experience. If only the open-world of Sleeping Dogs was matched with Shadow Warrior's combat...that'd be a dream come true!At a discount price it's definitely worth a shot checking out Sleeping Dogs. The game is promising, maybe you'll like it. Maybe, like me, you'll hate the combat so much you'll ask for a refund.			"

												This game is so incredibly buggy, I have a hard time fathoming it. Sure it'll play fine, but then something fairly innocuous happens (an NPC opening a door, say), and suddenly Wei is clipped out of the game and can't move. Or it'll glitch out and just stop receiving any input from controller, KB or mouse for 10-20 seconds. Or the engine will lose track of whether or not a mission objective has been completed, and leave you stuck in infinite mission hell. Or it'll forget to turn off a sound effect (such as police sirens) when you've succesfully escaped police. It's a shame, really, because I remember it as a fun game.			"

												As with any Square Enix game, you have to use a controller. The game is very poorly optimized for KB+M gameplay. Controls tend to be unresponsive 50% of the time.The graphics are reasonable and the game does make it feel like you are in Hong Kong. Combat with a controller is very smooth and enjoyable.For the price on sale, get it. If not, don't waste the $30.I do like the game, and the story seemed to be fair. However because of poor optimization I am going to not recommend the game.			"

												DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME ON PC. I have never writted a review before, but I feel as though this game deserves it. Pros: great combat system, great enviornment, decent vehicle mechanics, and you can unlock or purchase legendary outfits that are based off iconic figures and change a few fighting animations. For example: there's one based off Ip Man. Cons: riddled with bugs, and unresponsive controlled to the point where some missions are unplayable. For example: towards the end of the game, you jump on a scaffold that collapses, then you repeatedly press L shift to pull yourself up, but no matter how many types you press it, you'll always fall. You could be pressing shift at the speed of light, and you'll still fall. I've been replaying that check point for about 40 minutes now, and every time, I still fall.And the one of the enemies, called ""the Grapplers"" will, obiously, put you in a hold, and you have to continously press ""E"" to get out of it. BUT, 90% of the time, he has a steel grip where it's impossible to break free no matter how many times you actually press ""E"" , whereas the remaining 10%, you break free within the first tap...Also, one of the interesting features, the ""Action Hijack"" where you jump on a vehicle, pull the driver out, and jump in. It works. For the most part. Although there is a side mission in the game, where you have to retrieve a large vehicle, in which you have to jump on, and crawl to the side of it: You have to regain your balance every once in a while, and sometimes the controls (as I said) become unresponsive for absolutely no reason whatsoever, and you can't regain your balance, you then fall off, and once you get close to the door, you will fall off for no aparent reason, and there were a few times where I didn't fall off, and was able to make it to the door, but all of those times, the game glitched, and instead of going through the door, I go inside the cart, and my character freezes, while the driver safely continues driving. As for the story line: It's good, although compeltely unoriginal. This game might work better with a controller, I wouldn't know. But this game is so filled with bugs I can't even finish the main story line. And I'm on the last mission...  "

												I've finished this game on both Xbox 360 and PC. On PC this game is just way too buggy, I've fell through the world more times than I can count, sometimes I just get random things like I can't get into cars. Theres also the crappy police mechanic  where it's really hard to find a cop but  as soon as they're after you it'll spawn like 8 cops right in front of you. Theres also the tedious task of getting on motorcycles, It doesn't matter if you're being chased by cops, in a car chase or on a mission, 90% of the time you get on a bike you will have to go through the 7 seconeds it takes to put on a helmet and rev up the bike before you can drive off. I will only recomend this game if you're going to play it on a console but not on a PC and even then I'd only give this game a 5/10			"

												This game is broken it has a horrible frame rate even, on the lowest setting it probably goes to like 10 frames per sec. I heven't been able to play the game because it is too laggy. Unless they can fix this, i do not recommend it. It's been 3 months since the last update from the developer they must be close to finishing the patch for this game.My advice to the people who are thinking of buying this game is to wait until they patch it or get it on console.

												I prefer to give reviews based on gameplay experience, but in this case I can only go by what little I got, before the entire endeavor got far too annoying to continue.Let me get the positive out of the way first: It looks great, seems to be optimized great and overall any game that gives me a GTA style experience would be in my good books from the start. If there weren't the ridiculous control setup and clunky configuration. While you can remap the controls in this version, there are still some hard coded buttons that you cannot change, and it is annoying beyond belief.I am left handed, I don't use WASD, I use the cursor keys with surrounding keymappings. If you do this, the ridiculous idea of hardmapping the ""switch radio channels function"" (while driving) to a double-tap of left and right (cursor keys), is utterly moronic. You end up constantly hearing a click-click-click sound when you drive, even with the radio music turned off; nevermind the rather large popup in the top left corner of the screen announcing the radio channel change. To call that distracting is an understatement.They added the ability to remap everything else, why not this? Also, let me point out that the key remaps are not reflected well in the tutorial. I searched for a solution (probably for a good 2 hours), but nothing was forthcoming.I could excuse this kind of shoddy programming and lack of features back in 2008 when Dead Space pulled something very similar and would not allow you to remap some keys. I started using GlovePIE (which is better than AutoHotkey for gaming, because you can save different profiles for your games), and with that Dead Space and other titles (such as ""Murdered: Soul Suspect) are playable, even for me with my ""non-conform"" control setup. At least those games don't have other functions hard coded to the buttons. Speaking about button use; Sleeping Dogs won't even recognize all my mouse buttons either.I tried overlooking this glitch, I really tried. But you know what, after just the first post-intro mission when driving the van to the target location, I got so annoyed, that I quit and deleted the game. Nearly 10 GB downloaded for nothing. In this day an age where we constantly preach tolerance and are trying to make things more user friendly, having a half-baked control setup in a computer game is simply not acceptable. It's lazy, it's stupid and I don't understand for the life of me why some companies make these kind of questionable choices.			"

												Really wanted to like this game, but on the PC using mouse and keyboard controls it just doesn't work very well at all. Pressing the E key to intercept an attack hardly ever works properly, when I see an attacker go red, I expect the fact that I've pressed the E key would mean that it would actually do what it's supposed to do (and no, I'm not in a cool down from incorrectly pressing it earlier).Game over all runs pretty well, had some lag until I turned off V Sync, but the fight system just doesn't work very well if you're not using a controller.A shame, looks like it could be quite good fun, but I'm an old school PC gamer and the fight system just doesn't cut it if your used to any kind of real control over a game.

												I kind of enjoy the game, but the thing I hate about it is that the game feels sped up. It's absolutley annoying. Because of it being sped up, I can't drive a car for a second without crashing it. The car controls are also pretty bad, which adds to why it's so bad. Everything is sped up to around maybe 1.5 times or 2 times faster than normal. Why would they do that? Who thought is would be a great idea to do this? I can understand maybe it being that speed during fighting, but not the entire game.			"
