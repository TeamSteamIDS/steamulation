												Probably The best f1 game among all the f1 games released by codemasters , here are the reasons why- The last game in f1 to be based on racing purely, its mainly based on throttle , breaks and gears no crappy KERS and DRS (proper fights btw racers and simple controls no need  to worry about kers and drs stuff focus on racing)- The season where shumi returns from his retirement - Apart from f1 2011 , the last second game to support dx9 - The car controls good , f1 2011 was garbage with a terrible view point and f1 2012 was too arcade control but 2010 does it good throw the car around a turn and the car turns as you expect it to do no seconds.- Simple yet nice single player mode aka start from your team trailer , finish the race do a interview and get back.- no online pass no crappy dlc- great modding capability However  the game is not without its flaws- forced 10% race in story mode , later games allow you to change this but here since its 10% doing 7 seasons is going to take a long time- Crappy upgrades , some of them make no difference at all- lack of information during racing , the engineer is limited to a few words , makes no sense at times.- BUGS , there are a lot of em including faked ai times in qualifying , broken pit,ignorant ai, sector 3 time not shown etc- GFWL :X It even fails to download the only update the game has , so in case gfwl dies or fails to update get the update from codemasters insteadhttp://www.codemasters.com/us/f12010-us/pc/downloads/Its still worth a purchase probably the most easiest f1 game for newcomers to get into.

												F1 2010 provides an interesting, if weird, spin on Formula One racing. Instead of simply having races thrown at you one after the other, you get the option of playing ""full race weekends"" which includes Practices 1, 2, and 3, Qualifying 1, 2, and 3, the Race proper and an after-race interview should you make the podium.The interviews and performance you provide effects how your teammates view you, and while the opinion of your team is not immediately apparent, it starts effecting you in the long run.The races, even with a shortened lap count are long and can take anywhere from a half-hour to an hour and a half to complete. This isn't so easy to sit down and play, as it really requires the ability to dedicate yourself to complete a full weekend at a time. With that said though, it feels like a well-done Codemaster's injection into a rather straight-forward sport (to the layman at least.)			"

												One of the best F1 games of all time F1 2010 was the first release of a F1 game in a long time F1 2006 was the last major F1 game to be made and left a lot of fans wondering if there will be more. In late 2008 F1 2009 was launched on the WII and the PSP but not on the ps3, pc or 360 and that left a lot of fans disappointed, but late 2009 saw the release of F1 2010 this time only on the ps3, pc and 360. F1 2010 had a rocky launch with various bugs (that have been now fully patched) but critics and fans alike loved F1 2010 for its great graphics (that still hold up well today), fantastic sound, great ai and the best dynamic weather system ever seen in a racing game of its time, but where I think F1 2010 shines is the in depth career mode that has been dumbed down in later F1 titles. Career mode features press conferences after every session and official rules in tyre usage, full race weekends and so much more. F1 2010 is must buy for any F1 fan or racing game fan at only $9.99 you are getting a great racing experience that later F1 games have fallen short.F1 2010 features all the teams, drivers, tracks and rules of the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship. Introducing the, then, new no fuel refill during race pit stops ruleJust a quick FYI F1 2010 Requires GFWL (games for windows live) I thought I might mention it because some people hate GFWL, I personally don't understand why.

												This fix its not mine,but i post it for all the people who needs this.Works fine for me.Good luck.How to get F1 2010 working on Win 8 / Win 10 without GFWL1) Download the following XLive archive: http://www39.zippyshare.com/v/eKXHtjtu/file.html2) Extract the two files to your F1 2010 directory (where the F1 2010 exe file is)3) Launch the game via Steam4) PlayOnce you reach the part where you need to specify your driver name and surname, press Alt+Tab as the Xlive client makes a text box into which you need to enter the name and surname separately.After that, everything functions as normal, it saves, and you can play it as intended. Multiplayer sadly won't work, you can try LAN, but I doubt it will function, but worth a shot :) fix give by StoneCold on the hub			"

												F1 2010 was a nightmare to get working on Win 8.1, primarily beause of Games for Windows Live.But after reading a lot of community posts and having a lot of patience with the Games for Windows Live account setup, I got it working.And I love it! The game may be 4 years old by now, but I am having fun. Would recommend playing it with a game pad or a wheel, because keyboard driving does not have the needed accuracy and leads to frustrations.On the easy level I became world champion in my first season and landed a contact with Red Bull Racing, but I still struggled on some tracks requirering really precise steering and timing, like Monaco.

												F1 2010 still has the best My Career mode of any Codemasters F1 releases till date.It is highly immersive, with the pit crew constantly engaging you with in-depth information as you race your way along the track. There are also interviews that will affect your prospect with future teams.I believe the car setup and mechanics are quite realistic, and there is a very clear and noticeable difference in grip, handling, balance, acceleration, top speed etc when changes to your setup are implemented.This and the general gameplay easily offsets any graphical comparisons to the later releases, making F1 2010 a very amazing driver experience. I would recommend this game to a F1 fanatic who is specifically looking to immerse themselves only in the F1 world (and not any other cars).Giving this game a 4.5/5			"

												Despite its age, probably still the best F1 game by Codemasters. The best (and longest) career mode (up to 7 seasons), starting with one of the 3 new teams and working your way up.It was an interesting season as it was the beginning of a new era in F1. New points system. Return to slick tyres and no refuelling. And before the introduction of DRS and KERS, so more of an old-school racing experience.2010/10 :P			"

This time, we will be covering the second entry into the Franchise of games F1 by Codemasters with the game F1 2010. With the release of F1 2016, I recently did pick up this game on a very cheap price and played around a bit. It is a really fun game and I hope you guys enjoy this review.Pros:*Realistic Driving.*Dynamic Weather System is well done.*Fully Licensed Drivers and Teams.*Amazing SoundTrack.*The Circuits are very well built and give a true feeling you are watching a true race.*Very nice AI Driving (especially in the Higher Difficulties).*Autosave Mode is Nice.*Very good character and Car Models.Cons:*Very restricted Career Mode*Multiplayer no longer works*You need to install extra files to actually play the game.*The Exit button instead of being seperate is lumped together with the My F1 menu.*Community is a bit dead.Pros/Cons depending on player:*No Steam Achievements.*No Steam Trading Cards.*Lack of Replayability*To get the best out of the game you definitely need a Controller at least and/or a Driving Wheel. Points Score:1 - Not Recommended2 – RECOMMENDED AT DEEP DISCOUNT!3 - Recommended at Slight Discount!4 – Highly Recommended!5 - Must Buy! "

F1 2010Review Edit, (First Review done in 2011)I had stopped watching Formula 1 in the mid noughties due to getting bored with it, but still liked F1 and racing games in general. When I heard Codemasters were doing the official F1 game I had to try it. I am really thankful for this game as it actually got me back into Formula 1 and I have been back watching since 2010. The game is great and can be played by anyone as the difficulty is massivley adjustable from absolute begginer to near enough full on Sim. I enjoy games like this with a progressive career mode where you start from the bottom and work your way up. One thing I liked about this game over the later versions was the interviews.Freerider-Dave "

												Reviewing this from the perspective of a G27 wheel user, this game is abysmal. Doesn't control right, force feedback feels completely broken and I was not able to get wheel rotation, deadzone to feel even remotely usable. I have no interest in playing this with a joypad and so for me this game is a bust.			"

												A lot of people have complaints about this game, regardless of platform. It's not awesome enough apparently. PC in particular, suffers from more issues that the consoles as well; various, random laggy sections (usually in the menus or track intros) regardless of your specs. Apart from the F1 fanboys, and the issues, this game is fantastic. The AI are excellent though seem to turn on a dime, (I assume this was a dev decision, to prevent AI from ramming the player off the track). The weather is amazing along with the ensuing pit strategies for weather changes. It's stunningly gorgeous, all 19 tracks look beautiful and authentic, as well as the 24 car line-up. Played with a Logitech G25, you couldn't possibly get closer to the action without being in the driver's seat. 9 / 10			"

												So i finally bought myself the steam version of this game cause my original got stolen (and yes it still makes use of GFWL which no longer exists) but never the less, I own all the F1 games except F1 2014 and i have to say that F1 2010 has some of the closest racing, no DRS, no KERS or ERS just straight up racing. The AI is programmed so well and are bound to give you a good challenge on any difficulty, the AI challenges you lap after lap, they are tenacious and will hold their line into a corner until the very last millisecond, they won't give up that position easily as you switch positions 4-5 times per lap and when you claim the lead of the Grand Prix you feel the pressure as you are hounded by a pack of cars that are aiming for the same goal...Victory Lane... The whole RPG side of the game is awesome, you feel like a F1 racer with interviews and press conferences. This game has really captured what F1 enthusiasts want. 10/10			"

												Codemasters picks up the F1 contract, and produces this game.  Be the Driver! Live the dream!  Those were the slogans being banded about at the time.  And I have to admit, this got me very excited.  Did it live up to that hype.  Yes.  Car handling is great, tracks and cars look good, and the AI isn't too bad.  My only gripe is the colour palette which seems to make the game always appear set at dusk.  For a first game using the license, Codies did a great job.  Just a shame they've squandered it as time has gone on, trimming the tree of features down to the stump that is F1 2014.			"

												Best of all codemasters f1 games. Even if the auto spin curbs and the online play made me want to slit my wrists.They actually put some effort into the career mode in this game with lots of immersion and detail so that sad people like me could pretend to be Michael Schumacher for a day.After this they seemed to progressively remove most of the features you would expect in an f1 game year by year until we ended up with the turds that are F1 2014 and F1 2015.F1 2014 was saved from total disgrace by having a strong modding community who have produced some quality skins, add ons and season mods over the last two years. What i hated most of all about 2014 was A: The complete lack of rear-end grip, and B: The engine noises which were ear destroyingly awful. (The ferrari engine sound made me want to smash my headset after about 2  laps of brutal 1.6 turbo hyrbrid revving)and finally C: The complete lack of effort. F1 2015 was pure stupidity combined with total lazyness. The only things that made it even half bareable were it's graphics, the driving and the engine sounds were much better. STUFF TO NOTE ABOUT F1 2010:Windows Live is on this game. Yes windows live that HIV-like infection that hit many games released in this period, and like HIV it still hasn't gone away after so many years of ruining your life.Career mode is amazing. Auto spin curbs and random traction loss are torture.The handling is not perfect.  To be fair it was their 2nd f1 game they had ever made and 1st on a proper console.Tyre and Fuel simulation does not appear to affect the AI leaving you with a massive dissadvantage or loss of realism.The AI are a bit random and have tempers ranging from completely docile all the way up to the full Maldonado.David Croft tries to attack you with a microphone after every session. Your driver has no legs in this game. He got cockpit legs in F1 2011.Grid girls are a thing in this game.The race engineer is a complete knobhead, expect useless information during the race and ear destruction at the end of it.Career mode is minimum 25%  length races. Sprint Mode multiplayer is almost garanteed F1 does banger racing.			"

Update March 26, 2017It's also possible to win against Intermediate AI with keyboard. The trick is to use Prime tyres during qualifying so that you can go a few more laps before pit-in during the race.End of updateUpdate March 28, 2017Sample career gameplay against Intermediate AIhttp://dai.ly/x5gh29yhttp://dai.ly/x5gh2klEnd of updateGood game, by good i mean there's a possibility to win against the easiest opponents called Amateur AI while driving with the keyboard. However keyboard centering is too fast; adjusting steering deadzone and linearity makes little difference but then i'm not bold enough to try extreme settings so there still might be a more suitable setting for keyboard users.Update Jan 15, 2017 1807hrsNo way to adjust centering rate, however setting deadzone and linearity too high causes sluggish steering making the car handle like a truck around fast changing corners like Silverstone.End of update.Minor Update March 26, 2017Setting deadzone to 0% in-game and repeat rate delay to 0 works best for keyboard control.End of Minor UpdateThe right car setup makes a positive difference in handling around corners, kerbs and lowering lap times. Plenty of in-game graphics options to fine tune to your rig's performance; runs well on mobile Radeon 6770m but needs some cooling time in between sessions to get best results.Bugs are infrequent but it sometimes happens at the end of a qualifying session when you try to view the replay. It hangs to black screen so the qualifying session has to be repeated. I didn't try to view the replay again after that; didn't want to potentially waste more time retrying the replay.Update Mon Jan 16, 2017 2352 hrsAbout the replay bug: There's a way around it. Press Alt-Enter to switch to windowed mode; the black screen is replaced with the replay controls view but the replay would still be a no go. However you can now exit the replay and proceed normally. Switch back to full-screen mode if you will.End of update.Update Mar 26, 2017Seems the replay bug occurs if you use the time skip button in the garage.End of UpdateWindows live account is needed to activate. Not sure if it's needed to save game progress but it's needed if you want to get the achievements.Update Mar 26 2017: Login to Windows Live account needed to save game progress otherwise the savegame function will be disabled.Pretty solid game; the team manager's jubilant response when you win against the odds and the subsequent interview is very good motivation to do well and keep going.Update Mar 26, 2017Plenty of in-game graphics options to tweak to your PC's capability and separate sound level control for music, engine, voice and sound effects. There are also many options to customize difficulty settings; Race length, AI level, damage realism, flag rules, tyre wear, fuel consumption, etc..End of updateMusic doesn't play during practice, qualifying or race but does in the menus, paddock and replays.Update March 26, 2017AI is well behaved and may even seem to be tame up to Intermediate level, dunno about higher levels though. Flag rules are faulty because it may sometimes flag you for corner-cutting even when you run wide. Anyway there are 4 time rewinds available for those who aren't perfectionist and just want to get it over with.End of UpdateWell worth it when on discount, runs well on hot potato chips; just make sure to have some cooling downtime in between sessions. 8/10I added music to the gameplay 'coz it was epic to race in the rain.

												Absolutely fun game once you get into it. The game is perfect but thanks to the choice to use secuROM and Games For Windows Live, it can cause stress and anger and frustration. What I have learnt is that secuROM will fail if GFWL fails. secuROM can be dealt with on it's own by a crack but GFWL MUST work otherwise the whole thing fails. At least for me it does. Also GFWL seems to fail from MS's end and NOT the player's end. Here's hoping Codemasters replaces GFWL soon!EDIT: Try reinstalling GFWL if it appears to be failing, found out that it'll install and say it completed with no issues but really it failed to install correctly. The Game is perfect, just GFWL and secuROM that suck!			"

												Didn't work for me on my FX8350 AMD, 16 gb corsair 1600 ddr3, 750 Ti Nvidia 2gb card. Would keep accessing the hard drive thus making the game unplayable, juddering along losing valuable split seconds causing crashes galore, making it unplayable. Considering I can run Flatout ultimate carnage on highest resolution with everything maxed you'd think this game would be a doddle to run with my rig. No it wasn't the known replay bug either, because the replay folder was write protected and no file was within, this was set as default by the update. Gave up in the end. Steam gave me a credit refund so I could go and buy F1 2014. Think I'll stick to the newest versions from now on.			"

												This is a superb game.  The driving is a little on the arcade side, but still difficult and highly enjoyable.  You can choose from basic car setups along with the preferred tyres, weather has an impact on races, and the AI is no pushover - but then again I'm probably not the best driver in the world.  I'm using a basic joystick to control the car and it works extremely well with no configuration needed.The graphics are beautiful, it doesn't feel dated at all, the career feature is cleanly implemented and easy to understand.  And as others have said, there's no nonsense with KERS or DRS to worry about, its pure racing.  The only negative I see is that it uses Windows Live to save your progress online, when it could have just stored it locally.  I had a hassle getting Live setup and had to go through several iterations where it kept wanting to install updates before the game would load my Live profile, but once that was out of the way it hasn't been a problem.100% happy with my purchase, I'll be getting many hours of enjoyment from this game.

												This is the only codemasters F1 game I've played. I have tried the demo's of the others but have not been taken enough to switch from this one. It is a game I kep coming back to and simply love the graphics and feel of the race cars. My only gripe is that it is a bit easy. I was World Champion in my Sauber in my second season. No matter what difficulty settings you have it simply should not be possible. I play with no assists, legend AI and 30% race weekends. Actually if I turn off driving line and turn on tyre simulation it gets ridiculously tough! Regardless the Red Bulls should fly past my Sauber.			"

												I bought this game thinking it would not feature Games for Windows and could play it online but no, SecuROM crap also ♥♥♥♥ed me out too and I know this game and always loved it since I played on Xbox 360 and when I used to watch gameplays back in 2010. This is completely broken because I can play on practice/time trial modes but can't play on race because the game simply hangs or freezes. Unless you download a patch fix out of Steam and install it, the game won't run as it should, and that's really bad, I think it's just some AMD CPU incompatibility but the update simply doesn't get installed through Steam anyway so be careful while buying because this can bring you some good headache.

												A very fun game indeed. Of course you have to jump through some hoops here and there for GFWL to work for you but I would say it is worth it given the lowered price these days. I do have some weird issues where some tracks have laggy parts for no reason despite the fact that my 270X is more than enough for Ultra on this game. The AI is fun to drive against, albeit a bit easy to beat even on legend difficulty.			"

												It's been a long time without a big budget F1 racing game on the PC. It's not perfect, but it's definetely a great game.It uses GFWL, tho, which is a piece of craptacular crap. Ah well, there's nothing you can do about that.			"

												Fun, fun, fun. its formula 1. of course it follows last years season, but still fun. This game is not like grid, or forza, or other racing games like that full of many cars and many tracks, this is formula 1. its more about subtlety, each car has tiny differences that cause them to perform well in certain situations on certain courses. and the courses are honed to mirror their exact real life counterparts. monaco's tight kinks are as terrifying as you would expect. Silverstone's fast sweepers and tight 90s are challenging in the wet. The flat out 130r on suzuka is a test of courage. If you want to feel like a f1 driver, and experience the thrill of team dynamics and competition in a top notch racing game GET THIS NAO			"

												An excellent F1 racer.  The Games for Windows Live issue is no issue at all on this or any other title.  Just sign up for a free account, follow the instructions, and away you go.  I own the entire series of Codemasters F1 games and as long as they keep making them, I'll keep buying them.  Highly recommended!			"

												Warning! This game uses Games for WindowsIf you are a real sim racer this game is not for you. It feels like a game made for keyboard drivers. I set everything to the hardest settings i could manage, no assists, picked the slowest car, and won every race on the first try. AI is really poor, and the cars are too easy to handle.Other than the game using GFWL and the difficulty beaing to easy the game is ok, especially nice for begginers in sim racing. "

												What a ♥♥♥♥ around. Spent about two hours yesterday getting this to work, multiple versions of GFWL clients, 3D audio software, copying DLLs.... And it finally works! Only to come back today, literally changed nothing and it doesn't work any more. I only paid $2 for it but come on.			"

												This game is closer to 'sim' style racing games, but it has wide array of difficulty settings and handicaps you can turn on to help you improve your game. The online play has an added bonus of penalizing people who ram your car, so this game has less destruction derby type starts than Dirt 2			"
