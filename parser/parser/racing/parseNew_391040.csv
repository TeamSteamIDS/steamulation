												I was skeptical at first, I must admit. 4 hours in and I am more than happy with my purchase of F1 2016.So, last years iteration caught a lot of flak due to the game being practically incomplete (no safety cars, career mode, ect.) Not only that, but it was riddled with bugs to the point where it was practically unplayable. Now, normally, I would be irritated by this, but I cut Codemasters some slack. It was their first shot at an entirely new game engine. Surely, F1 2016 would be an improvement...Well? It most certainly is. With my expectations being low, Codemasters BLEW them out of the water. While the game is not PERFECT, I am finding it far more enjoyable than previous F1 titles I have invested in. There are minor graphical glitches here and there (stupid little things that won't hinder your gameplay, at least not that I've encountered). Better Yet, not once in 4 hours did the game crash to the desktop! I'm in awe!All in all, thank you, Codemasters, for listening to your fan base. You have done us a service releasing such a well done game. Here is to the future! We can only move forward!			"

												They done it. This game is just so ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!!! This year I found not even ONE bug in that game. Really great job from them!The most positve thing is the Career Mode . You can make your own ""Legend"", so you can choose your own avatar, your own car number ,helmet, name... Just great! The graphics are very very good and I have no performance bug. The curbs are so much more realistic. You must drive Italy , Monza^^ The curbs are in this game so hard . I recommened: Don't tuch at turn 1 and 2 the curbs or you'll loose sooooooooooooo much time. But the thing I miss in this game (in F1 2015 it was awesome to see) ,the sparks. I haven't seen any sparks. For me are sparks a great feature and it's awesome to see ,but in F1 2016 I never seen them :/  But still this game is awesome . I had never so much fun with an F1 game like this. But another bad thing is that the Safety Car comes not everytime out when some cars retiring when they crash with another car. Only sometimes, but still . I see it quite often. The new damage is really a challenge in league races. I had a league race in Monaco , with simulation damage. And we were 20 drivers. Me and 14 other drivers survived^^ So 5 cars crashed into a wall or something else. We had 2 safety cars and 1 virtual safety car.So now again to the Career Mode. It has so much content . I  love it to upgrade the car ,to decide what you are doing. Positive+Career Mode+Safety Car+ Virtual Safety Car+great graphics+You can choose own number, helmet, name, avatar...+no bugs+good performance+you can feel the speed very good +stable multiplayer (with 22 players it's stable too)+new damage model+you can upgrade your car (R&D)+you can adjust the cams (T-cam, offset T-cam, cockpit)+new Ai difficulty (Ultimate ,very hard you need much practice)+better and realistic curbs+realistic rain car performance +you got a agent and engineer+time of day editor+manual starts+formation lap+Manual Pit Lane Entry+new practice programsThat are the things that are in F1 2016 positive . Do you want to see something from the negative side??Negative-no sparks(fixed now)-replay fps bug (it's fixed since yesterday)I have to say very big thank you to Codemasters . I really love this game!Now let's look at some screenshots I have done!! It'S really AN AWESOME GAME

												Really happy with this purchase. Generally the only F1 game (aside from F1 2013) where I felt ""That was worth the full price."".Good:- Career mode is very in depth and will keep you busy for a loooong time (I am ~25h in so far and only halfway through the first season... career mode ends at 10 (!!!) seasons).- AI is pretty good (they are fast but they also make mistakes, really enjoyable and realistic)- Strategy is very important- You can talk (with a mic) to your engineer and ask him about things like the weather forecast, strategy changes, fastest lap,...- Although I believe this game would fall into the ""simcade"" category, I really enjoy the handling and physics of the cars- Looks good and performance is decent- Encountered no bugs so far- A lot of settings to change everything to your liking (rebindable keys, tons of graphics settings, you can set camera positions and FOV, force feedback and wheel settings, HUD settings,...)- Safety Car, Virtual Safety Car and dynamic weather can change up races within minutes. No race is predictable- Although Mercedes are strong they are not dominating the game as much as in real life. The game has good balancing.- New difficulty settings make sure that you'll have a challenge even though you are very good- You can develop your car during practise now and purchase upgrades as the season goes on, like teams do in real life.- Much better damage model than in previous gamesBad:- It can be difficult to find a fitting difficulty setting at first. ""Expert"" is very slow compared to the next step called ""Legend"". But with ""Legend"" the AI is suddenly fast as ♥♥♥♥. You have to fiddle around with the settings and assists to find the perfect balance. A difficulty slider from 1-100 would have been better imo.- AI sometimes have weird strategies- Your lollipop guy keeps you hostage until there is a huge gap in the pitlane during pits. That means you can lose a lot of time if the whole grid suddenly changes tyres and goes into the pits due to a weather change or safety car for example. I had a 20+second pit stop because of that ""bug"", usually it should take 2-3 seconds.- Multiplayer is still a cluster♥♥♥♥ and will not provide clean and entertaining racing. Usually everyone crashes in the first corner and then 5 people leave the server. Not a fun experience.- No VR support- Tracks are not laser scanned and can feel a bit off if you compare them to Assetto Corsa or iRacing (especially Spa).- Sounds are better than before but I feel like they still sound a bit like advanced vacuum cleaners.Verdict:Overall a very good game with some minor flaws. But well worth the money if you are a F1 fan and don't care about clean multiplayer racing. I would only recommend this game if you have a controller or a wheel. It will probably not be a fun experience with a keyboard (like all racing games).			"

												I have been expecting an F1 game as good as this is, for years.I've had every single F1 game put out by Codemasters, and as close as they could get to the real thing was the ""Classic"" 2013 series, but 2016 is the new classic!I haven't figuered out all the possibilities with strategies yet, as I find it extremely hard to look at an option screen to my right when going really quick, with another car in my mirror. But then, I am 68 years old. Absoloutely recommend F1 2016 to all driving and race fans of ANY skill or age level.Ahket.			"

												So i decided to buy F1 2016 after the positive reviews it got. But still i was skeptical because the previous iterations were disappointments. I started the game with a quick 3 lap race in Monaco. I chose Raikkonen and was sitting in 4th place in the grid. I was pleased with the presentation the game offered.Then the race started and in the first corner Rosberg and Hamilton crashed into each other. It was at this time i realized that this was the most realistic f1 sim ever.10/10- Best F1 sim eva..			"

												They made Kimi smile and Rosberg appears friendly with Hamilton. 0/10 Realism. Gut-busting banter aside, Codies have gotten it so right this time. I honestly have a hard time believing this game was made by the same people that have made the last few years' installments. I haven't looked into it, but perhaps there has been a shake-up within the development team. I have only scratched the surface of this title, but it's already miles ahead of past games. The physics feel largely revamped to the point where I felt like I had to learn to drive again, but I see that as a positive. Even playing with a controller, I can feel the car's weight. Turning into a corner at speed actually requires finesse and timing. In past games, turn-in felt effortless to me like your were driving a laserbeam. You can also really feel what your tires are doing and you'll have to tread lightly while they're still cool until you've got them up to the right temps and you can really pour on the sauce. The AI is another area where I'm noticing a huge leap forward. In past titles, I hardly ever felt like I was actually ""racing"" anyone. In 2016, the AI tries to maintain a natural pace through corners as well as the straights, will fight you for track position and will attempt to overtake you. The combat is satisfying. I'm also enjoying the newly added features like the development challenges you can do in the practice sessions and chatting with your engineer using a headset is pretty cool, adding to the immersion. Overall, I think F1 2016 is a very solid game. I was hesitant to spend the money as these games have been largely bland and disappointing for a few years now but I'm really pleased with what Codemasters have come up with this year. 8.5/10			"

												After the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥stains that were 2014 - 2015, codemasters are back at it and really in the swing of things! This game feel leaps and bounds better that the last three iterations of F1 and I can happily say money well spent. So..time to get into the pros and cons-Pros->Saftey car>Formation lap cause you gotta heat them tyres son.>Graphics are decent>Ambiance is good>Great wheel and force feedback support (Thrustmaster T-150)>A.I are agresive and will pressure you to slip up>Difficulty spikes are managable >Tyres degrade realistically>New Practice session R&D keeps the game interesting>No Maldanado>Danial Riccardio's teeth are realistically portraied>Racing in The wet is super fun-Cons->Some in game videos drop to 20+fps for some reason idkw>Kevin Maggneson is a vicious killing machine and will not stop until every car on the grid is destroyed>I seen raikkonen smile/Laugh and thats not realistic at all>Too much Anthony davidson>Not enough David Coulthard>Button Needs more japanese lettering on his helmet (And not the one on his head)>Aliens still exist in multiplayer>Pretty sure i seen a Ghost in SizukaThe Bottom line.F1 2016 is different, its a love letter to you from codemasters and it says ""we're sorry for making you poor with the last one... but we can change, we can take baking classes with you and really rebuild our realtionship"". The game feels polished you can really see the effort was put into this one, It all feels very German, Like a it was designed by a man in a labratory with a white coat, mustache and some of those oakly reading galsses. So if you're a true F1 fan, if your a car guy, If you like things like Triganometry and the taste of magnesium behind you're nasal passages, This..is the game for you! Take it easy my friends, Stay Cheeki Breeki!			"

												I am actually enjoying this. No problems with gamplay, or bugs so far. Except I get very low FPS when I am in the team's motorhome. But that early days.Pros:* Actually playable(compared with 2015)* Good handling* Good graphics* Formation lap gives you a sense of pressure to get your start right!* Manual Starts are a great addition* R&D gives a sense that it is up to you to develop the car right. (Career)* Different cars give you different feels. * Way more options to tune you car for the race e.g ride height is back!* Can choose the total tyres to have for the weekend. (Career)* Doing teams goals in practice are like mini games, they reward you with R&D points so you actually can imporve your car. And in doing so, you also improve your driving skills.Cons:- Still would prefer a button(Overtake) to deploy my own ERS.- AI can be improved- Bad frame rate in team's motorhome, while everywhere is fine- Bad sound mixing. On the pit straight, you can hear (loudly) the cars driving in the pits.Most of the Cons can be fixed in a future patch, so they are not that big deals.I am running a Intel i5 3.2 GHz quadcore and an R9 270X at 2560 x 1080. With everything on high settings, I easily get around 60fps. So good game optimization. Good work Codemasters on this front.**Will edit of more pros/cons are found**			"

												Its an improvement from the horror show that was F1 2015. Firstly, graphics are better, cleaner, as well as the lighting being clearer.Secondly, CAREER MODE and safety car.Thirdly, gameplay seems slightly more fluid than before. I really feel the difference in cars, especially the difference in engines (e.g Merc vs Renault for example). Overall, its a good, solid F1 game that I'm having a lot of fun with. There are still a few bugs lying around though, but mostly minor ones that can be overlooked.The one major downside for me is the incredibly unoptimized cutscenes. Normally I easily get 60FPS during races, but for some reason during cutscenes it drops to 20+FPS. Now either there's something I'm overlooking or its just plain unoptimized. 8/10			"

												Excellent game.  The only thing that has ruined it for me is the crazy time gap between levels.  Its 2+ seconds which is a lifetime in F1 so I'm stuck with eaither being to fast in or too slow and its ruined the feel of the career mode.  Rather than properly fix this game they go on to the 2017 release and that like all the other titles they release will never be properly fixed.  They should do less games and more DLC's rather than rushing to put out a release.			"

												Seeing that this title is on sale for the start of the 2017 season, I feel obligated to post a review to interested F1 fans who are yet to pull the trigger.This game is very nearly a masterpiece for an F1 fanatic. It's well optimized, it controls well, and you can customize the game settings and assists on your vehicle to make the game as hard or as easy as you'd like.This is the first F1 game for me. I've been playing using all three practice sessions and qualifying before taking on the full length race. I have to say that it is an incredible experience to progress through each step leading up to lights out.  The progression of learning the track, advancing your skills, and testing different tire, car setup, and fuel strategies pays off on race day.The tracks look gorgeous, and they are very true to their real life counterparts including the brand new Baku Circuit.  Weather affects your control heavily, and you can absolutely feel the difference in your vehicle's grip from the start of P1 to the end of Quali as more rubber is put down on the track.The AI is challanging in my opinion. They are agressive and they don't all mirror each other's strategies. You'll see a variety of tire compounds starting on race day and different pit strategies. Every once in a while you'll have an opponent spin you out from behind, but hey, that's what flashbacks are for!Last item of the positives: Voice commands for pit crew / race updates! So awesome!The only negatives I've found:Tire strategies during weather events are difficult because the AI has an advantage of knowing the better time to switch between slicks and intermediates/wets.Multiplayer doesn't have the same ""feel"" as single player.Sometimes AI will pull clearly illegal moves, but hey, can't be perfect all the time.In conclusion, It really feels like you are competing at the F1 level until you have to pause mid race to use the restroom.9.5/10			"

												Never thought i could write something positive about Codemasters again after seeing what they have done to F1 2015.But damn, they did some really awesome job with F1 2016. Lets put this straight and lets go with standard pros/cons.Pros:+Career mode is there+Research and development is there+Formation lap is there+Practice programmes are there+Team radio is much much better than in F1 2015+VSC and SC are there+Codies done well with race introductions by Crofty+Game looks fantastic+You can tell your engineer to leave you alone because you know what youre doingCons:-AI, AI, AI. Played Baku yesterday. Massa got a puncture and was going towards the pitlane. Unfortunately - he was driving on the racing line, on the longest straight. Guess what. EVERY SINGLE CAR CRASHED. Come on. You have to improve that bit. Shame i didnt record it, got the screenshots though. Another example - car with a puncture, every other car queued behind him, giving me an advantage-Went straight on Nouvelle Chicane several times and didnt get a penalty for it-On straights you can literally break right in front of the car behind you, causing that car to crash and youre not getting penalty for that-Kimi isnt there on title screen-Codies put Rosberg there instead-Grosjean is thereIf youre thinking about buying this game - go for it. You can go into career mode, sign contract with Mercedes and therefore replace Rosberg. That will make it worth it.			"

												23 hours into F1 2016 and i've decided it's time to review:This game is a triumph.For all of you who said they'd never buy again after the disaster of F1 2015 I was the same as you.F1 2015 was a complete disaster from broken multiplayer to the terrible career mode. That has all changed!Now we have proper multiplayer sessions where you can see who's hosting, which track, how many players etc etc, the way online mulitplayer SHOULD be!Career mode is a different animal all together compared to previous F1 games, you can create your own driver, pick his own number (unless it's the number already taken by a real life driver) you can create your own helmet and colour it which ever way you see fit. I know these are just small details but it makes a huge difference to how ""personal"" the whole game feels.In career mode you also have an agent who drops off messages and other important points of information, you have research and develpoment tasks during every practice session, giving you a reason to actually use your practice sessions, they test tyre wear over 4 laps, they test your knowledge of the track by making you hit markers around the track and you also have to beat a set time in what they call ""qualifying pace"" to see where you are in terms of the times they expect. All this, if passed, will give you reasearch and development points or ""R&D"" points which can be spent on upgrades for the teams cars, yes that's right, not just your car but your team mates too! meaning you can take McLaren from rags to riches over a couple of seasons if you so desire!All of this is fine, these mean nothing if the gameplay is poor but it is not! The feel of the cars, the graphics, everything is crisp and fantastically well made. I could go on for hours, it's 100x what 2015 was, you can talk to your garage and ask for information about fuel, tyres or even how your team mate is doing. They've added in the safety car, virtual safety cars, you can choose to do formation laps before the race start to warm the tyres. There's even manual starts where you have to hold the clutch and release it and accelerate to give the game a more natural start, rather than just holding the accelerator down and the computer do the rest, you can even get punished for jump starting. I cannot express enough my delight at the new career mode as it's what i've always enjoyed doing, I was so bitterly disappointed last year and was so hoping this year would be better and they delivered way beyond anything I expected.All-in-all the game is a triumph, from career mode rivalries with other drivers to competing for top stop within the team, it's everything I hoped for and more, thank you for listening to the players and giving us a game that is actually worthy of the F1 logo!10/10 "

												Oh God, this is the most detailed hand crafted carved F1 and racing game ever. It's almost perfect. The simulation is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, it captures in a low abstraction level what it is an F1 car, the tyre management is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, the fuel, the tyres! GOD the CRASH SYSTEM is the most MOST detailed, natural and sensitive system that I've ever seen in a game, this is in the whole sense of the word A SIMULATOR.The immersive experience is INCREDIBLE it captures the whole thing about being an F1 driver, since the manager, the crew chief, the contracts, the career, the development of the car, the improvement system, R&D program, the advantage of the teams due to investment on R&D, all the aspects of a car and its phases of improvement, how it works in real life. SIMPLY PERFECT, this is the FIFA 17 or maybe 18 of the racing games.NOT FOR ARCADE GAMERS, This is a simulator, the driving is HARD, of course you can customize the difficulty level BUT the top level is REAL, it's hard and the AI is hard to beat, they try to win really, overtakes and agressive conduction. There is PRO CAREER MODE where you can't touch anything of the options because is the REAL level, regarding to the level of AI, the duration of practices, NO FLASH BACKS, EVERYTHING REAL, NO FEEDBACK FROM ON SCREEN DISPLAYS. I'd say Lewis Hamilton could play it for now, it takes time to perfect the technique you have to be more than a PRO to win in the CAREER PRO.I understand that things on the way you create your driver, the face, and the helmet could be improved BUT COME ON! Codemasters worked reallly hard to bring this artwork, this masterpiece.This is an eSport absolutely.			"

												Pretty good. Great career mode with lots of options, driving is enjoyable yet challenging, and there seems to be so many variables that it can call itself a proper simulator. On the downside, it's a little buggy and there are some low quality textures dotted about. I gave it an 8/10, check out my review below.

			F1 2016 is the latest entry in Codemasters titular formula one racing series, and for many it is an answer to last years entry which received a mediocre response at best.

												I'm a big fan of racing sims and got interested in watching Formula 1 about 3 years ago. Im completely hooked and decided to try the game. I was going to pick up F1 2015, but general consensus is that it was trash. So I bought F1 2016 while being cautiously optimistic that it will be as close to the champpionship as possibe.6 hours in and I'm loving it. Totally worth the purchase. Codemasters have outdone themselves.TL;DR - BUY THE GAME, it's so much funLikes: My first pre-order without any hitches/delays/ Day 1 bugs Most importantly, I haven't encountered any bugs. Brilliant graphics and runs smoothly. Im gaming at 1440p with a GTX 970 Great intuitive career mode that makes you feel part of the action In career, you are in charge of upgrade to your car Balanced AI - Challenging without being annoying So many options for vehicle tune up Well integrated tutorials such that even someone who's not an F1 fan can enjoy the game Difficulty settings for everyone all the way from easy to ultimate You can issue voice commands to your engineer - Like telling him to shut up :-)Dislikes: I actually havent found anything that ruins the gaming experience "

												This game is seriously good.This is the Dirt Rally of the F1 series. The level of detail, settings and immersion is far and away better than any other codemasters F1 games to date. This game is suitable for the diehard fans and newcomers to the series with the wide option of assists and difficulty settings it has to offer.A few highlights/major improvements on past installments of the F1 series include full 22 player multiplayer races and championships. The connection issues of previous games finally seem to have been solved, while there's also the ability for you to reconnect to a race if your net drops. Career mode has returned with more detailed and realistic practice sessions that help you tailor your car setup to the track. Practice sessions also offer you the chance to earn tokens for car development. You can now also set multiple weather patterns for a race. Want it to start wet, then dry up and finish wet again, you can finally do that now.If you like F1 games then this is a must buy! It's simply so much better than any of the previous games. Even if you're not particularly an F1 fan but like racing games in general, then you'll enjoy this too as it has so much to offer.			"

												LOVE IT!!! nicely improved/polished over previous games ( my last previous F1 game was F1 2013 ) but here I felt like codemasters made enough improvements for me to get back I absolutely love the career mode! it's really amazing and deep and makes you feel like actual race driver. Really love that they put so much effort into it yes there might be better simulations out there, but there are no better GAMES out there! the career mode is really fun, and all the small challenges keeps you entertained yes, so far not that much time in this game yet, but it surpassed my expectationsI would highly recommend it to all F1 fans			"

												The F1 experience you've been waiting for. Puts all previous F1 games to shame in every possible way. With a focus on realisim, this is the best example of what a simcade racing title can be when done right. Featuring an indepth career, proper R&D with practice session tasks to gain R&D points that you can spend to upgrade your car as the season goes on, and contract offers to advance to different teams. Stunningly beautiful graphics and brilliant car simulation physics really immerse you in the world of open wheel racing. All in all, this is simply one of the best racing games of the decade.			"

												This is by far the best F1 game in a long time!Feels like the Force Feedback has been completely rebuilt and feels good, although once controlling the car steering feels loose until you hit the full steering lock left/right. It's like your calibrating the wheel real time. Not sure if that's to simulate fresh tires or not but it certainly is interesting. I end up off track more times than not because pit assist on rejoining track will suddenly give you control right before a hard turn.Control mappings from wheel show controller buttons for on screen menu navigation even when a controller isn't plugged in, no don't show off you're a console port! Sense of speed feels good, and careful throttle application is required exiting turns no matter how fast your going. Maybe a higher downforce setup would mitigate this, would make sense just haven't tested this yet. To me it feels like the F1 series magnifies every small mistake, something that I'm not neccessarily a fan of but it does make it more challenging and fun to master.  In race settings you can enable formation lap, then you can try to get your tires and brakes at optimal temperature, and it feels simply amazing having full control of the car following the pace car around the track. Problem is you don't get to pull up to your grid spot as control is taken away, then suddenly a quick screen flash which seems to refresh the grid for the start of the race. I'm truely impressed here, I just wish they would redo pitting entirely giving you full control and take the car off rails entering and leaving your pit stall.Even with all it's problems as is, F1 2016 shows potential to be truely epic. 9/10Pros:+ Career Mode+ Choose Your First & Last Name, Car Number (x74), Helmet (x46),  Avatar (x20)+ New Practice Development Programs (Track Climitisation, Tyre Management, Qualifying+ Agent & Engineer Face Time+ R&D (Research & Development)+ Three Driving Cameras (Cockpit, TV-Pod, Offset TV-Pod)+ Great Performance+ Good Sense Of Speed+ Stable Multiplayer (22 Players)+ New Damage Model+ Very Good Physics+ Better and Realistic Curbs+ Safety Car+ Virtual Safety Car+ Awesome Graphics+ New Ai difficulty (Ultimate)+ Realistic Rain Car Performance+ Time of Day Editor+ Manual Starts+ Formation Lap+ Manual Pit Lane Entry+ Good Steering Wheel SupportCons:- User Interface Needs A PC Touch no Function Buttons Please- Ai Needs Work- Low FPS in Hospitality Hub- Needs More Commentator Dialogue- Force Feedback Needs Tweaked			"

												Easily the best entry in the Formula 1 game franchise by Codemasters. Pretty much everything about this game is perfectly crafted. From the actual SkySports commentary for pre and post session cutscenes, to the implementation of the 2016 tire rules. The career mode is like nothing I've seen in a very long time in the all the best ways. It's somewhat reminiscent of the career modes that EA crafted in the peak of their NASCAR liscense days. NASCAR Thunder 2004 had hands-down my favorite career mode in any racing game, but F1 2016 is giving it a run for it's money.I have only a few minor complaints, and it's all mostly cosmetic. The two biggest is simply that there are no female avatars to choose from in career mode, and that there are no interviews like there were in F1 2010. Otherwise, I miss the loading screens like they had in F1 2013 and 14 (though since it loads in the background during menus it's really not a big deal), and the fact that it's kinda poorly optimized. This is the first game I've encountered that my PC doesn't meet at least the minimum specs for, but on the default settings I do usually get around 60fps anyway. The paddock scenes actually kill my FPS the most. The physics model is a little bit tricky to get a hold of, but once I had the proper wheel settings and got some practice on the track it felt pretty natural and somewhat similar to the 2015 McLaren in iRacing and the 2015 Ferrari in Assetto Corsa.If you are a fan of racing games, Formula 1, or perhaps even sim games in general I think this title is worth a serious consideration.tl;drPros:Career mode rocksThe AI are challenging, and will actually attempt to pass youThe presentation is greatVoice commands work really wellCons:No female avatars (F1 Championship Edition did this 10 years ago)No interviews in career mode like 2010Kinda poorly optimized (Still getting around 60fps tho)			"

												If you are reading this and you are like me and have been sadly very disappointed by the recent F1 games here is what you need to know.9/10 - Season & Career single player modes are both in-depth & immersive. 7/10 - AI has been greatly improved, It's still not human but it's the closest it has ever been. (keep an eye out for AI in the wet, they drive like they are in the dry)8/10 - Visually the game is stunning even at 4K or 21:9 & wider. (still clearly bound by console fidelity)9/10 - Engine Sound, yes its the turbo era, But Codemasters have nailed the sound even down the finest of engine/turbo details. They really did some work here.8/10 - Atmosphere sound is rich and immersive with great menu music & some of the best commentary the franchise has ever featured. (Sadly no Martin Brundle or Ted Kravitz)8/10 - Racing Wheel & Pedal FFB & feeling is great. It's not Assetto Corsa but even a finely tuned Fanatec wheel owner can still enjoy some of the detailed rear wheel slip or kerb feeling.7/10 - Car Handling and Physics are improved. Again this isn't Assetto Corsa or iRacing level. Dry racing is still on rails, wet weather feel has seen some improvements and feel more challenging & rewarding when perfected.8/10 - Track design has finally been updated to better represent the real life counter-parts. Some tracks had previously not seen layout updates they where first implemented in F1 2010. Melbourne T10 to T11 no longer has grass against the wall. FINALLY!!!!!!9/10 - Voice Command, This feature seems trivial. But it simply works, see the list of valid commands below and make sure you speak with a clear tone of voice into your mic. ""Leave Me Alone"" & ""Shut Up Jeff"" are genuinely valid responses just FYI. LOL!!!Overall this franchise has finally seen some love & revitalization it badly needed. While I understand the difficulties of a yearly cycle, this looks like a game they spent 2 years making not 12 months.*At time of writing I have not tested multiplayer/netcode. I will update once tested.VOICE COMMANDS:box this lapfull race updatedriver in frontdriver behindwho am i racingtyre statusvehicle conditionweather reportfuel informationpit stop informationset hard tyresset medium tyresset soft tyresset super soft tyresset ultra soft tyresset intermediatesset full wetsadjust wing upset wing balancechange wing downteam mate statusrival statusfastest lap overallbest lap updatelast lap timechampionship standingsengineer quietengineer talkengineer repeatfewer updatesmore updatesshut up jeffleave me alone			"

												Having a fantastic time with this years edition. From F1 2010 - F1 2015, each year the hours I put into just got smaller and smaller. Not so much because it it was getting progressively worse, but because the improvements they did make were less and less attractive. This year however, everything is feeling just about spot on. The career mode is exceptional, the safety car and virtual safety car implementation is well done. Formation lap, practice goals and simulations, options regarding strategy during the race. The atmosphere is there. This is F1.However, my engineer Jeff is a bit of an idiot. He usually wants to pit on the 2nd last lap. He also keeps telling me how sunny it is from the pit box, when I'm clearly outside during in the beautiful day. There's two corners Jeff, I know it's not going to rain before the end of the race.Also, my agent is a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥. She'll have a bit of a chat with me, then go and sit down and leave me a voicemail. Seriously. Too lazy.Daniel Ricciardo's smile / 10			"

												Codemasters, please try to learn to make a decent AI. Everything is great is this game, graphics, driving, FIA F1's licence, rules, tyres, cars are actually differents, tracks are good looking and match with reality, the rain is good, safety car, VSC, etc... And thanks race strategies can been edited. Looks so good, right ?BUT AI is the same crap as F1 2015, it's crazy. I just made a wonderful race at Spielberg. I was 10th with my Manor (but no pitstop yet, should be 11th or 12th). I made a small mistake when braking for turn 1 so I lost speed. Alonso come and try to overtake by the right. OK, I go left as much as I can, far is grass so I couldn't go more to the left. I keep my eye on the braking zone because it's gonna be the fight there with Fernando.Héhé LOL, no, absolutly not... Once again the AI push my rear in the straight, send me into spins and the wall finish the job. Crazy, crazy, crazy. Watch the replay, if an actual driver make it ONCE he lost his super licence for life. It's a shame I didn't had FRAPS or other recording soft to show you.The problem is, most of the races finish like this! I'm tired of the series since 2015. TT are awesome because the car control is good, so much better than before, but the AI ruin the races.Oh, and the FFB is crap. Like the entire series BTW.			"

												Edit: CM has said that they will not update this game anymore... Shame for themI would like to recommand this version of F1 if Codemaster fixes bugs. Being a Formula 1 fan and having played F1 2005 on PS2, F1 2009 on both PSP and Wii with 100% race on careers, and F1 2015 during the freeplay (which was kind of rubbish tbh), F1 2016 is way better than its predecessors (Graphics, gameplay, tire management and settings, etc.). So for its pros:-Awesome graphics and framerate for middle-end GPU (you can race at around 30fps on heavy rain with a car crashing in front of you)-Realistic sounds (the motor sound is quite original to the V6 hybrids)-Safety car with VSC both back -Choice to manually control the speed when entering to the pit lane-Choice to start a race manually, needing to wait the red light to go off and engage the clutcher-Possibility to have a race at any time during the day, eg Abu Dhabi at noon (rip tires)-You can let your engineer via TR to shut up (""Shut up Jeff"" is actually an achievement)-An indicator that shows you how far is the DRS line-Tire management improved, the effects of the rain on slick tires are more obvious (drop of tire temperature and lap time)Cons:-UNAVAILABLE Career mode. I just simply can't start a career as the game crashes each time I start the FP1 in Melbourne. It crashes right after the presentation of the circuit, no matter how many times I reinstalled the game.-The track dries too quickly, being a bit unrealistic (Two laps after the rain stops on full race, everyone enters to the pits and changes inters to soft tires.)-A bug about TR that happened several times, I am playing on X1 controller, but sometimes when I just want to get ""Full race updates""(on the first page, second choice) it chooses mysteriously ""Get intermediates tyres (on the second page choice 4)"".- Jeff says ""The weather is unavailable"" during weather changes (eg from heavy to light rain), so you don't know if you need to continue on your current tyres or going back to the pits to cahnge tires, and it will be much decisive if you do not want to be undercut.-Both hands of the driver being away from the steering wheel at the end of a race (if you achieve first) but the car turns magically (eg after crossing the finish line in Mexico).-Formation laps are meaningless as you can hit the wall and overtake as many times as you want, without having any penalities or damage on the car.-A bug when the safety car is out, the driver in front of you may be overtaken if he goes off the track just a little-Kimi smiles at the podium XDIn overall, F1 2016 is a great game IF bugs are being fixed. :-(			"

												Finally another F1 game that's worth its price! I must admit that Codemasters did a really good job on this one.F1 2016 is - as the name reveals - licensed for the current season with all your favorite Formula One drivers from Hamilton over Grosjean to Haryanto. The graphics look almost lifelike and the different tracks feel like the real thing.Positive:- safety car and virtual safety car included- stands and pit lane feel alive with an audience and the crews present- pit garage is beautifully animated- cars feel balanced- training programmes during free practice provide motivation for collecting development points which you can invest for upgrades to your car over the season- career mode is lots of fun- animations before practice/qualifying/race add to the feeling of being a part of F1, as does the possibility to do a formation lap before race start- weather changes are quite challenging- very good damage models and collision simulationNegative:- even with a very good graphic card that can handle the settings on ultra, the game still sometimes loads stuff in the background and becomes rather bumpy, which sucks especially while driving through corners- AI behaves rather erratically at times- keyboard users are at a disadvantage at the tire wear training programme. The handling is too harsh if you don't use a controller or steering wheelI haven't tested the online multiplayer yet, so I can't say anything about it.All in all this is the best F1 game I've played since F1 Racing Championship. I can definitely recommend it to all racing fans out there.			"

												Before i start this review i would like to point out that i’ve personally only played around 15-20 hours of this game. The rest of the hours were played by my father who seems to keep coming back to this when he wants to play for an hour or two. And seeing the amount of hours we have played he must enjoy it. But this review will be from my own opinion. I guess I need to start by saying that I know very little when it comes to the sport of F1. I know most of the drivers names and I have a basic knowledge of the rules; as in I know that there are cars and they race around a track for a large number of laps. So given my knowledge of the sport and the fact that I don’t really play racing sims, I wasn’t sure how I would get on with the game.Thankfully, F1 2016 welcomes drivers of all levels. If simulations are your thing, players can switch all of the assists off and experience the game at its most challenging. The management of the car can be completely left to the game, or the player can intervene and set the car up as they so choose. This means that all of the technical stuff that the game simulates and that fans will love, can easily be sidestepped by those not in the know; something that I really appreciated.And when you do finally get behind the wheel and put your foot down, well that's when F1 2016 really comes into its own. The first time i took part in a race with the assists off and the laps turned up to full takes the kind of discipline and mental focus you would usually associate with a hour-long boss battle. Races are mentally demanding and physically draining, but they're also incredibly satisfying, especially if you manage to come out with a place on the podium.Codemasters caps it off with some of the most impressive visuals we've seen from an F1 game to date, especially when the heavens open and it starts to rain. If only they would've put the same effort into the character models and crowds, but hey you can’t win them all right?F1 2016 isn't just the best game in the Formula One series, it's also one of the finest racing sims available right now. It's a tough game with a steep learning curve and lots to get your head around, but it's also genuinely rewarding. Although it  won’t be for everyone, it is a testament to Codemasters’ appreciation to the genre and their commitment to their fans. Taking lessons learned from previous games and applying their expertise, Codemasters has developed an almost perfect simulation of the greatest racing competition on earth.This is an F1 game for F1 fans, but exciting enough to pull in those who'd never normally sit through qualifying. You can't really ask for more than that.			"

												After i sortet the G27 issue, i was able to jump into the game and accomodate myself a bit. The game is looking great, for me it`s optimised good. All on ultra with 980ti, i got about 70-80 fps, not bad, still there is room for improvement.The issue with steering wheels is because of 2 factors : 1. Windows 10 Latest Update or 2. Beta drivers from Nvidia. Codemasters made this game for an older windows version and with an older driver from Nvidia. After i removed GeForce Experience, i could play with wheel. This is not Nvidia or Microsoft`s fault, the issue must be fixed bu Codemasters only.			"

												I've been playing simracing games since 7 years and i can safely say this is the best F1 game that has come out so far.Codemasters are finally moving in the right direction. It is competetive, handling takes a while to get used to and feels a lot more like proper simulator than arcade racing game. AI still suck, multiplayer is still a crash fest.To sum up previous F1 games:F1 2011: I've spent most of my time on this game - you could easily cut the track, the cars had ENROMOUS grip and never understeer, it felt like pure arcade racer.F1 2012: I literally played it for 2 hours to find out it was the opposite of F1 2011, it would understeer LITERALLY everywhere, handling felt terrible.F1 2013: Was mix of the above, very well balanced game and my previous favorite.F1 2014: Basically just reskinned F1 2013 with more torque (you'd end up spinning your car easily).F1 2015: You could easily drift the car around every single corner... But i got it for 5€ so it paid off.			"

												Best F1 game so far.There are not many racing games on steam and I havnt enjoyed one since GTR evolution (if you kids even know what that is). I see a lot of negative reviews for ridiculous reasons. Just becasue your steering wheel lags the game or you dont like the kurbs are slippery then dont play f1 its simples.Almost has a racing sim feel if you take all the assists off (im only half way there yet). Best AI in recent f1 games, the other racers really push for overtakes. Its nice to see me car development has been added. The graphics are stunning, the game runs flawlessley, the difficulty being ramped up gives a damn good challenge (only on expert so far).So for this game ignore the negative reveiews, if you have a pc that has the spec, a knowledge of f1 racing, like previous f1 games then this game is for you. Much better than the last couple of years in f1 games.			"

												Kudos to Codemasters for making big improvements with the 2016 version of this game.  I have to admit I was skepical to buy this even with the Winter Sale, given the last couple of years, but I am pleasantly surprised with this release.  The graphics are phenomenal, the career mode is deep and the controller support is much better in this version.  They are on the right track.  We now need the ability to customize a few more things in career mode, etc such as weather.			"

												I played every F1 game from codemasters besides 2015 and this game is by far the best!The force feedback and physics are way better than 2014 and as always the graphics are amazing.I also like the option to completely disable your hud and just rely on your engineer which leads to amazing immersion!Also the AI is like 100 times better than in F1 2014 or earlier. Again I can't compare this to 2015.I can give you a little example: In my first race I drove without the hud and everything was working fine, but in the end of the race I got a radio problem, so I couldn't communicate with the engineer. The last thing I knew was that my engine is loosing power and that the RedBull behind me is coming closer rapidly. Because I didn't knew how many laps were remaining I got super nervous and just hoped for the checkered flag each lap. As you can probably guess, it was an amazing experience and this game may be the first F1 game in which I will complete a whole 100% distance season.In conclusion I can say that although this game got no super hardcore physics like other sims on the market, the pure racing and immersion combined with solid physics and force feedback position this game on the must have list for every racing enthusiast!

												Fantastic F1 game. The best in years actually. Handles very well that you can even use the XBOX360 controller if you don't have a wheel+pedals setup.Whilst the Career gamemode is interesting, it lacks depth, it could be much more. Also I found after my first year, despite being second in the driver standings after Rosberg, I was kicked off the team by Ferrari to Sauber? Don't really understand that as I had a good season. Think the best way to do career mode is to start off with a lower-level team like Sauber, Manor, Force India etc then work your way up.Looking forward to the F1 2017 game now. Especially with all the new changes to F1 in reality.			"

												Well,  I am about 5 hours into this game and 2 full race weekends complete as well as a few other bits (time trials etc) at the time of writing this.If you like F1 and you want the best F1 game out there then look no further.  Codemasters have managed to turn it around from last years poor show and have created a cracking F1 game.This is great fun with accurate gameplay as well as cars and with lots of great little realism touches.  There are so many to choose from but my favourite ones so far are on the race weekends during practise sessions you have to do differnet types of runs such as tyre management etc (I know people dont like this in the real F1 but it adds some great realism and breaks up the pursuit of the ultimate lap to favour careful strategic driving).  My other is the clutch off the start line, screw this up and you will end up with a start like Lewis had at Monza and all your hard work is gone.  This follows a one shot qualifying which does put the pressure on!I love this game. This is the best one so far, you will not be disappointed. Buy it!			"

												First Impresions Review...Outstanding improvment on how F1 2015 was released, Career Mode is Sweet as and keep you very busy My TX F1 wheel worked straight away this time with more options for FFB and other settings the GFX are SOOOO sweet FPS is very good on my R9 390x 8gb  80 to 150 fps Max settings in heavy rain, Voice control actually works a treat ( never worked well for me in 15) AI are really challenging the higher the level you go and Race very hard. Saftey car is back with Manual control behind it VSC is in.there are minor gfx glitches here and there from time to time but not a game breakerThe ONLY gripe i have and always have with F1 titles is NO MOUSE control in menus. apart from that well done codemasters a title out of the box worth yelling about...ill update more detail there further i get, but i will say if your on the fence about buying this title but love F1 and have some enjoyment from any of the past F1 titles BUY it the Immersion is amazing ive never turned so many laps in Praccy before until now.

 The best F1 Game ever? To make it short:  YES! ""But why?"" I hear many of you cry.I own F1 2010 and 2013, and have played every demo for the games that I didn't have.So, why do I love this game so much?- The handling of the cars just feels  real  I have never had so much fun experiencing such high performance realistic driving models. I don't know. I never drove a F1 car myself, but if I could, I would imagine it behave exactly like this game suggests.- The presentation is really, really good! Apart from the overall superior graphical quality, you feel like really being a participant in one of the best sports there is.- What I personally find most interesting about F1, is the tactics. And maaaan, this game is nailing it. You are able to accurately adapt your tactics to your driving style and your engineer even suggests possible changes of tactics, reacting to current race events (such as change in weather, safety car, or other cars with unexpected speeds are observed - do you want the same tires?). This is very useful and expands your F1 gaming expierience by a lot. You even have the chance to test your personal tyre usage on the track, adapting the race tactics to you personally, which is nice.Another great thing about F1 2016 is that you see how much dedication the devs put into this piece of software and how much of badasses and racing game developer extraordinaires work at this studio. There is so much love to detail!Of course there are bugs.But you know what? Almost weekly updates do a great job fixing them. I once encountered a sound bug. 7 hours later it was fixed.The only real thing which disturbs my experience is some kind of unbalanced AI. You know, at track A I have absolutely no problem winning, whilst on track B, I hardly manage to make it into top 10. But that's nothing that cannot be tweaked over time. Maybe I'm just a noob who likes certain tracks more than others and my own performance is varying so much.But I will keep this review updated as soon as something changes. Cheers!Have fun with this game!			"

												I've only played 5 hours so far so here's my early impressions: It's already better than F1 2015 in every way. I put over 50 hours into F1 2015.First off, the game was is more optismised than than last year's title. On my 970, I'm getting over 100 fps on high settings in both dry and wet conditions. Wet conditions on the previous game would always have severe drops to 30-40 when driving near a few other cars. The last game also had micro stutters occasionly. I have yet to get any in this game.The actual driving is largely the same. I've noticed the rear tyres don't spin up as much which I always thought was a bit extreme in F1 2015. It's still more arcadey than sim but honestly I'm fine with that. The addition of steam workshop support for car setups is a nice feature.It's got a proper career mode! And the best in the series to date! I love the addition of the track acclimatisation, tyre management and qualifying simulation programs in the practice sessions. It's a great way of prepping for the race and improving your car during the season by earning R&D points. I started my career in Manor with the aim of bringing the team closer to the front of the grid.I've seen a few bugs, such as a UI graphic that stayed on screen for an entire race and a floating ghost driver during a single-shot qualifying session. No crashes thus far. The multiplayer isn't broken at launch like the last game.I just want to play more!			"

There is nothing to complain about for this freaking awesome F1 game. DRS, PitStop, and all control very cool. You can speak to your crew for changing tyre, race information.

												Loving it.  I skipped 2015 due to a lack of career mode and generally unfavourable reviews so my opinons on this are based on a comparison to 2014 (which I loved).  -Career Mode feels immersive-New R&D format is fun and feels rewarding-the graphics are a large upgradeTook me a little bit to get used to the steering and I miss the old tyre/fuel menu whilst driving but now that I'm getting comfortable with it I like it.  I had some issues getting 1440p settings to work but it seemed to have resloved itself.  Pit crew communication phrases are a bit limited.EDIT: Finding the AI to not be the brightest...a few instances of them smashing into the back of you when you make a good move on them.  Doesn't happen too frequently.The framerate in the office scenes is pretty low and choppy, but it's a minor thing that doesn't affect gameplay and isn't encountered frequently or for more than a few seconds.9/10 for sure.  They'll definitely let me know if a storm-front moves in.			"

												I've got to say. I went into this title with medium to high expectations that were shattered by some ctds, clunkyness on menus etc... updated my drivers all went to normal with a couple of 2 ctds after last patch on august 24th. August 25th all smooth, no issues whatsoever. Pretty unusual, so let's begin.Straight into business: This is the best F1 game I ever played. Not that the bar is set through the roof with the legends as F1 2002 by EA, Grand Prix 2, 3 and 4 set in the past, but overall this is a up to par title.Personaly it is the best. Technicaly, F1 2016 can be said that is in the same tier with the release dates put into account.Break Down>Sounds  6/10 : Starting with the bad part of this game. A heck ton of glitches in the sound system. It absolutely needs patches as of August 25th. Cars inside the pits being ultra loud, sounds cutting out, etc...Graphics  9.5/10 : Gorgeous game. You can check youtube videos for general feel. Dust effects looks much improved maybe thanks for Dirt Rally from the same devs. Amazing.Gameplay  8.5/10 : You can talk with your engineer for race/event information with your microphone, examples: tyre wear, info about car in front and behind, pit strategies, accept new strategies or decline, tell him to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up etc... This blew my ♥♥♥♥ing mind (getting old as♥♥♥♥♥♥. Features and features improved from previous titles for the better experience to the player. A few problems with menu flow and it's animations (it's slow).Physics 8/10 (PLAYING WITHOUT STEERING WHEEL AT THE MOMENT; check other reviewers with steering wheel experiences to match yours) The cars have weight finally. Their behavior is even more believable than in previous titles. Cannot say much technicaly, but it feels good.Features 9.5/10: You get carreer, you get custom championship made by you, you get time trial and able to rival another human on the leader board with access to his car set up, you get a lot of options in graphics to controls and hud. Car setups are there with the new rules and both safety car and vitual safety car. Everything looks fine at features unless you look at how you set up the AI difficulty. Next item VVV.AI  7.5/10: It's a stone in the shoes of codie's F1. Quite a lot of people complaining about the AI difficulty gap between 2 sets of pre defined difficulty levels from the devs. They REALLY should put in difficulty by % and not 5 presets for the player to choose.I don't mind agressive AI at all but sometimes an AI driver behind gets clueless about your movement and may make you spin in a straight. Once made contact on their front wheel with you rear wheel they force you to spin instead of backing off. This happens with VERY low frequency.They are getting there, personaly I preffer this than the glorious F1 2013.Replayability 10/10: The game is made for you to come back. You can be the guy/girl that plays championships outside career mode, you can be the guy/girl that plays only career (there's a ton of content there), you can be the casual that plays one 5 lap to 25% laps race a day, you can be the guy/girl that plays 75% to 100% races, doesn't matter...I had F1 2013 in a pedestal in my mind from the Codemaster's F1 games. I replaced it with F1 2016.Just the voice comands to ease on workload while increasing workload in other areas while you're racing is great. It's a treat to F1 nerds.Solid 8.5/10. Can be a shiny 9/10 if patches iron every little tinny imperfections.			"

												Absolutely worth it if you love F1,or racing games in general.+ Deep career,great Online features,quick races are fun too. AI is much better than was in the previous titles. Loving the sound of the cars and the handling also feels quite good.- 2015 to 2016 -15,20 FPS in performance. (Graphics not improved at all.) Sound bugs sometimes in FP,Quali session. Hope thex fix it soon. --- +They solved the FPS issues with a fix for AMD Cards,and the sound stuttering gone too.Thats it,go and buy it! :D			"

												After spending over 420 hours on F1 2015 league racing, I can safely say that this year's release is both far more engaging over a longer period of time, and far more developed in terms of career, online championships, handling, force feedback and visuals. This game is everything that F1 2015, and all previous Codemasters F1 titles, should have been to begin with. 8/10			"

												Pretty good, I'd say best one yet in terms of driving.Pros:  - Best one in terms of driving - More realistic curbs, some can derail your lap - Slightly better AI behaviour, 2015 was ridiculously kamikaze - Upgrades have added more incentive to career mode - The split timer is a great great addition - Very good in race menu, with voice commandsCons  - I've experienced some framedrops that don't occur in other games, some have crippled my online experience by badly freezing up (drops from 75 to the teens). In the offline mode they're relatively minor but more regular (drops from 75 to 50s, or sometimes 40s), at least in this mode you can pause until the frames settle again.  "

												**** Initial Review **** More Detailed Review Below ****Just over 4 hours in and this is a much better game than previous versions.Had a lot of fun with the R&D in Career mode.  The tasks are like mini-games you have to complete in order to progress.Learning to drive with the new physics. Cars feel like they slide around a lot more this year (no assists).Graphics are improved significantly with some of the biggest improvements being the lighting and reflections on the cars.The sound of the cars is realistic, and the commentary and voice work is varied and of a good standard. The race engineer has a lot more to say than before and can now even read your lap times for you.Great game so far, very challenging.**** More Details ****Off the bat, it is clear that this is the very best version of the F1 series made by Codemasters so far.Presentation is about as good as you can expect from any modern racing game, and the way it is done here has the potential to immediately suck in any F1 fan.  A very smooth and simple interface allows you to quickly jump into any race around the 20 circuits available on the calendar as any one of the 22 drivers and 11 teams on the roster this year.  For a more in-depth experience you can play the Career mode which allows you to select your own driver avatar, name and number and pick which team and team-mate you race with for the 10 season campaign.  Career mode is beefed up this year, in addition to your laptop, you get access to an agent and an engineer who assists with contract negotiations and R&D updates respectively.  These are simple tocuhes and whilst updated on previous iterations (the motorhome and laptop 2013 - I think?).The Career season itself is customizable allowing you to set anything from Full Race Weekends to various shorter versions and race lengths from 3 Laps to 100% Races.The difficulty settings range from Very Easy to Ultimate, and new level more difficult than the previous highest difficulty setting - Legend and there's something for everyone.Unlike previous games, leaving on the driving assists doesn't actually do much to slow the driver, so you are not rewarded as such for driving with no assists vs assists.R&D tests are offered during Practice Sessions on Career Mode which add a few fun minigames which can be done during practice laps. Success in these tests are rewarded with R&D points which can be used to improve your car over time allowing a Manor to eventually have enough parts to challenge a Merc (in theory).  The results of the R&D tests can be viewed, and actually an help the player become more precise at placing the car and making the tyres last longer.The podium is available for the winner and two runners up. The animations are better than previous games, and are just a nice little touch which you do not get with simulators such as Assetto Corsa (another fantastic racing game/sim).Replays are available after races, with the standard range of cameras to review the race. The ability to flip between drivers has remained and makes for some good fun watching incidents and accidents between other drivers.Time Trials have new features as well as keeping all the old ones from F1 2015. Now you can race rivals and also get access to the setups of all the other drivers on the leaderboard allowing you to benefit from the tried and tested settings.  I personally love this as I am horrible at setting up a car myself.There is also the ability to download various car setups posted on the Steam Workshop from other players (thanks guys! :) ) which is immensively helpful to everyone from the complete novice (like myself) to a budding engineer aiming to be the new Adrian Newey.As of yet, I have not delved into Multiplayer which now has Lobbies and also a time delayed Multiplayer Co-op championship (I think).Just about everything you could want for this game exists here in this version.  Short of adding a part where the player can be Lewis Hamilton during his time off, there's not much more that could be done.Over time, I think there will be better and more immersive versions of this series, but for now, this is as good as it gets.

												I will make this review as short as I can. The game is really good as a whole, it has bugs but very few and Codemasters are trying their best to polish it up. I played F1 2014 and when I came to F1 2016 it was a whole new game, the feeling of the cars and the grip you have but when you lose it. Well if you've seen F1 races those barriers you see along the track is now your new friend.  A Side Story:That is of course if you get that far with friends ""not doing it on purpose mind you"" Friend saying: ""oh hey I'm next to you, but your faster then me go ahead of me"" You saying:""thanks"" then you go into the apex at the corner to only be greeted with your friend's front wing into your side.  Friend saying: ""I'm sorry I couldn't break in time"" You: ""sigh since your front wing is gone and go into pit with him"" Friend gets out of the pit in front of you and you watch as he barrel's into the first corner. The Ai bump into him at the corner to get on the racing line for him to only fly into the barrier and lose his front wing again. You: ""Start laughing so hard."" Friend: ""not happy and sighing""  You: ""then look at your position ""11th""you go into a serious One Punch Man mode"". You: ""Focusing so hard you start catching the driver's ahead for 10th-6th, for only Jeff to come on the comms and say ""pit strategy change"" you look down for a second to change it, look up and Ai are braking for the turn you brake hard and your wheel comes off while hitting the barrier."" You just stare at the screen saying ""Jeff never talk to me in the corner's!!!"" Friend ask ""what happened?"" You: just sit in silence watching your friend race. 20 minutes later Friend is in 8th going for 7th. As you watch him catch the Ai, it suddenly teleports in front of him and he brakes hard into the turn to only lose his wheel. You: laugh and asked ""what happened?""10/10 Racing is fun with friends onlinePros:+Career is back with more depth+R&D for Career+Pick your own Driver and work your way up with a bad team+Feeling of the car's+Graphics+Immersion+Ai challenges you+Curbs are less forgiving if you full throttle on them+No large assist help (holding hand/under the hood, with all assist off) for pad users""FYI I'm a pad user""+Multiplayer Championship+22 playable gird position's for online+Search online lobbies+Safety Car and Virtual Safety CarCons:-Ai are really aggressive if you are slower then them (I'm learning to get used to them but it might be a problem at first for new drivers)-R&D is short for Career (All the Upgrades in two Seasons(A mod improves it though))-No R&D for online Championships-No Podiums/ Track Intro's Online (Toogle On/Off Option?)-Online issues playing with others around the world sometimes-Ai are getting away with no penalties sometimes online-Ghosting Cars Online (Toogle On/Off Option?)*The con's are more towards online but it's still enjoyable "

												Absolutely sublime game, but what separates this from other racers (and I have played very very many) is just how much there is to do and think about while you are actually driving. You will go from thrashing the knackers off the car to nursing the thing around the track,  depending on how far the guy in front or behind is, WHO is in front or behind you, how well your tyres are holding up, changes in track conditions, you have no time to get complacent here. If you have even the slightest interest in anything with wheels, buy this game, buy it right now, or I'll fall out with you. Forever.			"

												Previously I mainly played F1 2013, i.e. I've never touched the V6-era F1 car in any game (clearly Real Racing 3 shouldn't count). The first feeling I got from this game was that -- the car is sliding everywhere! I firstly thought this is because of my controller setting, then realized that we actually have much weaker aerodynamics in F1 nowadays. That explains. Nevertheless, if you're switching from the Codies' V8-era game (before and including F1 2013), you might have a big performance defeicit compared to your level before (like I do). I used to play against legend AI and could easily beat them in F1 2013, but now I find my pace roughly the same as an expert AI in F1 2016. Practicing should make me more fluent in this game anyway, but I do feel this game is more difficult than F1 2013. By far I also think Red Bull is slightly faster than Ferrari in this game, which is kinda realistic. 10/10			"

What an improvement since this all started with F1 2010. Well done Codies, exactly what we have been asking for! Once of the best, if not the best, F1 games to date. I nearly missed this title, but saw YouTubers playing it with early copies. Developers could learn a lot from this - if you have faith in your title and nothing to hide, put out some early copies!

												the game is good but there are some things that need to to be improved. Muiltplayer tick rate is one, it feels like bf4 on releace in terms of net code feel(i don't know what the tick rate is or if the game uses a PTP system for it's networking).AI well as a hole there great but is terms of speed the large time gaps betwean difficulties, i wish that they would use a % slider and every 10% would change the name of the difficulty, then i could have the AI at a level so there competive with me at my skill level(I'm on expert but wish that i could make the AI 5-6 tenths faster).time trials, I think that in time trails that asists should not be allowed.Driving Asists, i think that assists should not make people go faster, in other words there is no reason for people to learn the game with no assist. i would say to make people lose braking peformace with ABS on and acceration with TCS.As a game this is very good.

												If you are using a gamepad, such as an xbox controller, steer away from this game. Although the game itself for the most part seems like a good game, it is unfortunately ruined by a very high input delay for gamepads. I have tried every combination of the (quite limited) control options to no avail. The core issue seems to be a very low saturation on the rate of steering input. That is, try moving your controls from far right to far left, it will take several seconds before the game reaches far left which you can see from the visual response of the steering wheel. Unfortunately, it is so slow that it is impossible to counter-steer if you have a bit of oversteer. You don't really feel the car and can't make any quick adjustments, which just ruins the immersion. A very conservative and predictable driving style is necessary just to keep the car on the road.From the discussion I've read, driving wheels do not seem to have this issue as the game input is one-to-one with your steering wheels angle. If this is what you're using, I'm sure you'll enjoy this game. It's unfortunate what seems like a small fix for Codemasters completely ruins the game experience for me and many others. I've gone back and reinstalled F1 2012 which just feels so much better. There is some steering rate saturation here as well as is natural for gamepad inputs, but it is so much faster and feels much better. My recommendation is stick to 2012 or 2013 until Codemasters fix this issue - if they ever do. Meanwhile I urge the developers to add options for the input rate saturation and any other parameters that the game uses for gamepad inputs.Update: I found a video demonstrating the control issues:

Posted: November 16, 2016
												I can appreciate a good driving game. I picked up F1 2013 about a year ago and became almost fanatical about Formula 1, with 3 full-length, 100% race length seasons completed with much enjoyment. F1 2016 seemed to be a natural choice as a next game, with updated graphics and car models bringing my racing experience into the current season.I thought it a safe assumption that as my system fully covered the recommended requirements, that this game would play like a charm. I was only right to a limited extent. While a quick race (to test it all out) seemed to fulfil all my expectations, I quickly found that the game crashed reliably at the start of every time trial and every career I began, rendering it unplayable in any meaningful way.Finding that these kind of technical issues were a more-or-less widespread problem, I contacted Codemasters technical support to receive no response and accompanied by no visible reassurance that they were working on the issue.So for me, F1 2016 joins a trend of games that appear to promise a lot but are fundamentally broken for at least a certain volume of players and for an appreciable time after release. Rather than this becoming one of the games that I might be tempted to check back on every few months to see if it is finally playable, I'll be pursuing a refund instead.I consider it a shame, considering the official title should be the only way to definitively experience a popular sporting event from the inside, with nearly all other attempts to simulate F1 falling short in some way or another. Codemasters could have done better to prepare their game for mass consumption, support it well and use their position as an official vendor for an F1 simulation with an ethical responsibility to fulfil the expectations of their player base more comprehensively. When there seems to be little-to-no appreciation that their customers have ended up with a problematically supported and broken game, further compounded by a lack of assistance or reassurance that it will be fixed, Codemasters should really look at their policies with intent to improve the overall situation, or risk losing a lot of business.So after a good day-worths work confirming that their game should run without a problem and that there were no issues with my PCs performance, that's where I personally stand on the issue. Diminished confidence in a design house that already enjoys a reputation of rocky reliability, as a result of a game which is unplayable for a wide spectrum of computers and (specifically, it seems) graphics cards which they purport to support.I'm sure I could be a rabid supporter of the game if it had delivered on its promise. But an unreliable game with little reliable technical assistance garners no recommendation.Possibly worth a buy if you are entirely prepared for the hassle of installing, reinstalling, validating caches, wasting time trying a plethora of different graphics settings, drivers etc. to see if it works. And proceeding with the hassle of the refund process if it doesn't. If you've got a spare day or two, you're welcome to the challenge.			"

												What an amazing turn around from last year's game. Codemasters went from one of the most feature-less games in the series with F1 2015 to the most feature-rich. There are still a few things that I think could be improved upon, mainly in the driver AI realm, but this is one hell of a way to get the F1 series back on track. The new career mode is pretty much everything I have been wanting in a career mode since I played F1 2010. I can see this game being my most played game of the year.			"

												I have been playing these F1 games since the 2012 edition, and i have to say this is my favourite one, the only issue really is the agressiveness of the AI (even the blue flaggedback markers will take you out), apart from that i love it.Hopefully now the next game will iron out the AI issue, because really for me thats all thats needed, 100% worth the money.9/10			"

												Great racing simulation. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to challenge his driving skills but also to those who are looking for fun game and begginers since you can really optimise difficulty and realism levels to your prefferences. Graphics are very beautiful and combined with great audio this game can make you feel like you are accualy there driving on the track. Only negative thing that I can say about this game is that in career mode I have encountered lots of AI retires caused by engine failiure, way more that the amount in real f1 season. My final rating for the game is 8.5/10. I would give it 10/10 for the amout of fun I had with it but there are still few things that need improvement that will hopefully be fixed through patches.

												While this is not a perfect game by any means, and there are areas to improve, this is certanly the best f1 game from codemasters so far, and you will enjoy new career mode and finally playable(Still not perfect but playable) multiplayer. Does this worth 50 bucks? Well it depends how much of an f1 fan you are, you'll certanly enjoy this game anyway but if you are not in rush, wait for the sale of some kind :)			"

												What an amazing turn around from last year's game. Codemasters went from one of the most feature-less games in the series with F1 2015 to the most feature-rich. There are still a few things that I think could be improved upon, mainly in the driver AI realm, but this is one hell of a way to get the F1 series back on track. The new career mode is pretty much everything I have been wanting in a career mode since I played F1 2010. I can see this game being my most played game of the year.			"

												It's the best sports game I have ever played! The simulation of driving feels really great; realistic, but not too realistic. The carrier mod is much better than before, If you start from the bottom teams you can play for ten sesons and became a multiple world campion. The AI has improved considerably they are more agressive and tachtical than before. Also graphics has improved slightly compare to last year. If you like F1 or sports like me I can advice to buy this game.			"

This is the F1 game you have been looking for.Be warned, this is a long one. If you are looking to buy the game then maybe this will help.     Where do I start? F1 2016 is the F1 game that we have been waiting for. Immediatley starting to drive yielded noticable improvements that made me feel much more satisfied with this years installment. Now, if you were like me, you watched almost every single pre-release video from the likes of xMattyG1 and Tiametmarduk, so there weren't any huge surprises with any big new features. Despite the element of surprise not being there, I was still excited to start my Career Mode, and to see the all the detail in the paddock.     I want to go over one thing more than everything else, which will be summarised below, and that thing is Career Mode, and things that you will encounter while racing in it.      Career Mode is back and better than ever. With a more in-depth look at the life of a Formula 1 driver, you will be sucked into the game more than ever before. You are given ten seasons to compete in, either moving around to get to the top, or making your favourite team the one to beat. You are able to fully customise your avatar, choosing from a multitude of appearances and helmets (which you can customise further). You are also able to pick your own number, besides ones that are either in use or retired.     Testing gives you a whole new reason to do Practice sessions, and allows you to upgrade your car. For now, they are a fun and informative way to see how you can be getting the most out of your car. Later on, they will probably just be another thing to do to get those research points. Tests include the Track Acclimatisation Test, the Tyre Wear Test, and a Qualifying Pace Test. All fairly self explanatory. The only issue I have encountered has been with the Tyre Wear Test, as I couldn’t complete it at all. It wasn’t because the tyres were degrading, but because I couldn’t set a laptime that was quick enough for it to count. Although that was frustrating, it boils down to my skill with the game, and how I am driving a Sauber for my Career Mode seasons. Car upgrades are chosen by you, and you have multiple areas for improvement available. Other teams will upgrade around you as well, so if you aren’t moving forward as a team, you’re moving backwards. Upgrades are done with research points, which you gain from the practice testing. The better you do in the tests, and the more objectives you hit, the more points you get to create a dream team.     The formation lap, manual starts, and manual pit entry add a greater sense of realism and difficulty. The formation lap allows you to heat your tyres and brakes, while warming up for when the lights go out. If there is one thing I would highly suggest is to use the manual start feature. It isn’t hard, and allows you to get a great start, as opposed to every other version where you would be guaranteed to not get away well. I have found around 12000RPM is a good spot to be in, although that was just me testing in a few different cars. Manual pit entry lets you brake for the pit lane, which could allow you to gain on, or even overtake other drivers. Penalties will be awarded for speeding, so practice trying to find the perfect spot to start braking. Just make sure you don’t get a “speeding in the pits” penalty while serving your previous infraction for speeding in the pits.     A new damage model gives the gameplay that ever needed realism. Instead of just a “Full” damage option, there is one more called “Simulation.” Now, if you hit the wall, or touch the rear wing of another driver, you will lose parts accordingly. When your tyre does come off, it is attached to tethers, which will keep it with the car.     What goes hand-in-hand with complete carnage? Safety, because you can’t have one without the other. The safety car makes its return to the game, and brings along its younger sibling, the Virtual Safety Car, or VSC. While the removal of the safety car in previous versions might have just been a PR move to “bring it back” for more hype, I can’t complain now that it is available. You have complete control under the safety car, but I wouldn’t go passing other drivers while it is on track, or pass the safety car itself. Bad ideas. While under the VSC, you must keep to a delta time between the cars around you, or you will get penalised. Like the safety car, you still have full control under the VSC. Maybe try changing your strategy when the safety car comes out, and also be ever alert when it is returning to the pits. You can make up serious ground on those around if they aren’t paying as much attention.Here are some awesome things about F1 2016. Career Mode makes its return. Multiplayer works! You can have great battles without incident! Ten season career mode with dynamic car upgrades. Practice testing which allows you to gain data to improve your race pace. Formation lap to warm tyres and brakes. Manual starts allow you to get a lightning start. Manual Pit Entry. Simulation damage. Safety and Virtual Safety Car. Rainy conditions are hard to drive in but can be rewarding based on the circumstances. Great looking graphics. The sounds are really well done. The kerbs seem more aggressive. Time of day controls. Pre-race tyre allocation settings, as well as a revamped race strategy page. The laptop which shows rivalry and team information before a race. AI failures and incidents. Ultimate AI, so if you think you’re good, you realise that you aren’t. Better menu system The Baku street circuit, as well as changes to other circuits to mirror real life. Addition of Haas and Renault.     The one issue that I have ran into is how the menu stays on the last selected item. If I quickly want to rewind, but I last went to the garage, the selection is still on Back to Garage. It has cost me qualifying quite a few times. Not sure if this issue is ""working as intended"" or if it is something that could be fixed.     Multiplayer works really really well from the races I have done. Side by side battles worked out flawlessly, and there was no hopping around. The aliens have disappeared!     If you are worried about the recommended spec level, I run with a Xeon E3 1231v3 and a GTX 970 with great performance.      I love this game so far, and Codemasters has really stepped up their game from last year. Community input, testing, and communication shows that they do care about our racing experience. I look forward to playing it whenever I can.Spoiler Alert Hamilton wins. No specific race, he just wins. "

												If you've been waiting on the side lines, like me, for Code Masters to get their act together with the F1 genre (since 2012) - rest assured they have finally got there. This game is excellent!AI drivers are no longer just a wet sponge that you easily overtake and never see again. They crash, they barge into you and each other and they go through phases just like in the current generation of F1. After fighting my way to the front of a race, I pitted and undercut Vettel to be 2nd behind Rosberg. He pitted as well and after being neck and neck, he pulled away to finish with a 16 second gap in the end. Meanwhile, Hamilton came from 5th after the last round of pit stops and was scrapping with me for 2nd. Add to this the fact that your team are constantly evaluating your options for undercuts and changes of strategy based on race conditions and how well you're protecting your tyres, and it feels like you're racing in real life.Code Masters have finally listened to their customers and added the in-depth R&D - which introduces more RPG elements to the game. You can start with a front-running team and still upgrade the car, or take a lower tier car and hunt down the front runners over time. I was really worried they would stuff this up but it's pretty much spot on.I don't play much online, but there is also an online multiplayer championship, and all of the usual matchmaking head-to-head (full 22 cars!).

												I am 5 hours into my career at the time of writing this review. I have to say that I'm very impressed by this game. I own F1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and now 2016. The 2015 game did not work for me when I bought it, and I returned it shortly after, hoping that the 2016 iteration would be better optimised for PC users. F1 2016 seems to have reinvigorated the series, after two lackluster titles in 2014 and 2015. The visuals are gorgeous, the game is streamlined, and I get great FPS on my system (i3-2120, Radeon HD 7970, 6G RAM) which is by no means a top tier system, all while running on medium/high settings. The safety car and career mode are both back which are major plusses as well. The customizable player character is also a nice addition. I see on the community pages that people are having difficulties running the game, and I can only hope that Codies' do their best to provide patches allowing people to play this game. It is as good as F1 2013, and that's saying something. Recommended.			"

												A fantastic combination of simulation and gaming elements. Obviously because it's designed to appeal to the masses, it's not a full blown ""Sim"", but the total package of the F1 race weekend, R&D, tyre/fuel strategies and the ""Formula One atmosphere"" make it easily the best Codemasters F1 Game since F1 2010. Whilst the game is visually stunning, it does need some performance optimisations as it can lead to a pretty poor frame rate if you choose to turn everything up to ""11"", so to speak. Console ports tend to do that...The AI are also rather unbalanced when it comes to Practice/Qualifying pace versus Race pace. In practice and qualifying they're lightning quick, but in the race they're much slower, meaning you often have to change difficulty levels between qualifying and the race. A very worthy successor to F1 2010. The rest are garbage in comparison. 8/10.			"

												F1 2016 is an impressively balanced in a way that should appeal to a wide variety of gamers.  The customization is deep, and should make it enjoyable from beginners to serious sim racers.The presentation is one aspect I particularly like.  There is a real feeling of an F1 weekend, and while this may be superficial, it makes the whole experience more enjoyable for me.Strategy is more important than ever, but it's done in a very intuitive way that is easy to understand and utilize.  This adds a layer of depth to the racing.Overall it feels like F1 and most importantly, is really fun.			"

												I'm an occasionnal racing game player and so far I love F1 2016. I was hesitant to pick this one up because of all the bad reviews and bugs from the last year version. No crash or bugs. I had no problems running this game with a gtx 980ti with 60fps or more all the time on Acer predator X34 (21:9 ratio supported). There seems to be performance issue with the player hub in carreer mode where the fps drop really low but that wont keep you from enjoying the game. My only deception is that the game don't support multi gpu SLI.My thrustmaster t500rs wheel work really well and the forcefeed back is amazing. No configuration needed. Everything just work as it should.Graphics are good espescially in rain condition. I think Project cars look better than this.Gameplay is great. It's a bit more arcade than Project cars but I like this way. The cars feel and handle very good. You wont have you car drifting and going out of control if you push the gas pedal too hard like Pcars. It's alot less punishing when you make a mistake.I mostly played the carreer mode. It's very addicve as you'll want to make your pilot progress by completing team objectives, face to face challenge and gain experience points that you can spend to upgrade your car by achieving race objective.  Unlike the empty and uninteresting Pcars carreer mode this one is great.The ai seems ok. They wont bump into you unless you make something really unsual. I'm playing at medium difficulty and I'm having alot of fun.The voice control for strategy, pit options and info on the race is a nice feature. I like it. It's easier to stay focus on the race than trying to manually navigate the menu.I compared alot to Pcars because this was my favorite racing sim with a wheel. I never played any F1 20xx before.Overall it's a must buy if you like F1 racing game.			"

												Finally a decent F1 game from Codemasters.Pros:- Nice graphics.- A very interesting and immersive career mode with lots of features: Character customization, car development and actually workable R&D tests and many more.- Very decent physics.- Tyre wear seems not to be scripted anymore.- Improved voice recognition (The engineer finally understands my Greek accent :D).- You have more control of your car (Manual starts, manual slow down at the pit entry, chose if to repair damage or not etc).- More strict and fair penalty system (It still needs some work though).- More sensitive car damage and a small improvement in damage model.- Better online experience with less lag and less aliens :3.- More customisable races (Scripted weather, race time etc)- A realistic race weekend with tyre choices and all the practice sessions.Cons:- Driver faces are terribly designed. My eyes are burnt!- Damage model should be more detailed. Suspension damage for example does not exist. It's only wheel on, wheel off.- Physics need some improvements too (They are not bad though).- The info menu right down is not so easy to use (Sometimes I lose my focus to the race because of that).- A.I. should be a little bit more aggressive. Especially in higher difficulties.- The engine failures happen very often which is not reallistic.- Virtual Safety Car's and Safety Car's pace is terrible and very unstable. Also the delta during these periods is completely♥♥♥♥♥♥as the A.I. go slower than it. Furthermore the A.I. slow down instantly which is really dangerous if you're right behind them.- The jump from Expert to Legend difficulty is still an issue.- Mid Session Save is buggy. When you load a Mid Session Saved race I just get a freezed black screen.What the game misses:- Dedicated servers!- Manual pitstops.- Detailed damage model as I said above.- Gearbox failures and any other similar to that.- ERS!- More difficulties and a detailed difficulty menu (Like A.I. pace, aggression and mistakes).In conclusion: It's worth to buy it but not for 50 euros. Maybe 30-40 euros would be ok (At least in my opinion). It's the most completed F1 game from Codemasters so far. The first game after F1 2013 that keeps my interest more than a week and without getting bored. They've made some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥for the first time! 10/10 IGN.........The first time I'm not done with an F1 game!			"

												*Disclaimer* Sorry if my english is not 100% accurate sometimes, french-speaking guy here.After the flops of 2014 and 2015, F1 2016 didn't disappoint me. Here's my pros and cons.Pros:- Nice handling- Intense racing- AI make mistakes, and therefore alter the race. It can catch off-guard on your strategy with pitstops, and sometimes screws you up big time.- Looks great to me, but not exceptional- Nice rewind duration, allows you to really correct a mistake you made- The career mode is nice- The formation lap and the podium scene are great added features!Cons:- The AI are sooo dangerous! I just finished an intense race at Barcelona where I had to defend my 1st place to Hamilton. The battle lasted like 4-5 laps, and I had to defend my position on the pit straight. Even though I swerved only once to the right to defend, Hamilton rammed in there and spun us both out 3 times on 3 different occasions. And that is not the only occurence, Vettel did the same thing to me in Sochi on the pit straight.- These so-called ""programmes"" in the career mode. Man.. It's amusing at first, but quickly boring, especially the tires one. Now I totally understand that it's part of the job as a driver to deliver data for your team so they can improve, but.. yea. I'd rather do them all at once if I could! :PNevertheless, that game is great. I retrieved the feeling I had in 2013, only the handling is smoother in my opinion. Many hours of fun are ahead of me. :D "

												The best F1 game in a long time. F1 2013's Classic mode was pretty good, then they dropped the ball for 14 and 15, but now at last they seem to have gotten things together with their year long dev cycle.Practice sessions now have a purpose with R&D points awarded for various actions, most of which are the challenges or ""minigames"", the best of which is the track acclimitation which helps you learn the track for the first time. I found myself spending as much time practicing the track as I did racing on it.Safety cars (real and virtual), Formation laps and manual pit entry are also all great new features.Graphics are good, finally looks ""next gen"" compared to previous years. (Just don't look too hard at people's faces, but who cares your here for the cars/tracks).Oh yeah, and you can actually talk to your radio engineer with your microphone, asking important things like tyre or fuel information, who's infront of you and what their pace is... or just tell him to shut up :D			"

												Pretty solid game, Im an F1 fan and have played all the games that have been released on the pc. Not a lot I can complain about really, the sub menus during a race are hard to go through unless your on a nice straight, my pit crew always suggest a ""better"" strategy during my race and the lack of a pit lane button, I dont understand I still tear ar*e in to pit lane and the game slows me down itself, maybe its my ingame settings Im not sure, my biggest gripe with this game though is the lack of anything to do with the new ers system the same as the 14/15 versions, and no overtake button which in my oppinion once the kers was dropped is sorely missed.Overall good game and probably worth the money, codemasters have did a good job, but I always find myself going back to F1 2013			"

												This is my first F1 game since 2013 and I'm not disappointed. The new cars really do feel different and you can feel the torque they all talk about :) The graphics are great, though I haven't seen them in all their glory with a race in the wet. All the tracks so far look awesome, with a lot of detail. Sound is perfect and lower revs make for a much more enjoyable experience with the volume up.They have obviously put some love into this game and not just rehashed an older version, so far I like little touches like your lap time being read back to you.Anyway, back to it.Edit: I've fallen in love with it. I'm running it at max at 2715 x 1527 and the tracks look amazing. The handling is awesome too, I hate it when people think games are not sims unless you're spinning it every two seconds, driving isn't that hard, so a simulation of it shouldn't be. You can really spice this up though by simply removing antilock brakes and it adds a lot when you lock up like a pro.I particulally like the Time Trial set up with your next rivals ghost instantly loading as you beat one and it's fun to think that people will be racing yours.Thoroughly recommend it 10/10			"

												Bought this game with high hopes. Was not dissapointed. Still comeback to it several months after release. The only problems i have are:- Career Mode progression is a nice touch but in the end you end up how you started because your upgrades carry on to the next season limiting how far you can upgrade the car.- Ai aren't aggressive enough on all difficulties apart from Ultimate Difficulty which really is extremely fun to drive.

												Pros:+ Career Mode: Back to the series, and better than ever, career mode is pretty detailed, customizable and fun. I hope Codemasters had learned the lesson with F1 2015 and never fail to invest in a career mode.+ Research and Development: the best R&D mode of the whole series. Performed during training sessions, the challenges are fun and challenging, and teach you how to conserve tires, fuel and understand the track.+ Difficulty levels: With 8 levels of difficulty, and several customizable help systems, the game allows the players to maintain a challenge level perfectly compatible with their abilities.+ G27: Perfect compatibility with the Logitech G27.Cons:- Graphics: Very very bad. Codemasters continues to recycle the same graphics engine since 2010. The game looks like a 2013 game at most. With bad textures, terrible shadow effects, reflection and water, the game disappoints a lot in that aspect. The optimization is reasonable on the track, however in the garage it's awful, and it drops below 40 fps on a GTX970 + i7.- System of rivalry: During the career mode the game always keeps you with an active rivalry, without any use. You earn nothing after winning the rivalry, and immediately a new rival is announced, and sometimes it is the same rival already defeated!- Control in the rain: it may be my lack of ability, but I continue with extreme difficulty in running in the rain. The lack of grip does not seem realistic to me. We do not see the F1 cars sliding all the time in the real races.- Accidents: the most annoying aspect of the game. It remains the same F1 2015 problem, which opponents touch you in the back as if you did not exist! And in ALL the touches, including the small ones , you are always the disadvantaged. Your car will fly off the track and opponents do not move 1 cm. Frustrating!Verdict: With a new customizable and full career mode, fun R&D mode and adjustable difficulty, the game remains fun for dozens of hours. Despite the dated graphics and flaws in collision mechanics and control in the rain, the game can be considered the best of the whole series.Score: 8.5/10			"

												Outstanding game that has it all -- licensing, graphics, and gameplay. Races can be as easy or as difficult as you'd like due to a plethora of assist and AI difficulty settings, as well as race/qualifying lengths and Career mode feels a bit thin as far as options regarding your actual career. However, the racing itself is king with F1 2016.I wouldn't even bother playing this without a race wheel/pedals...If you're into F1 and video games, there's no reason for you not to get this, full price or not.

												The game is good no doubt and i say it every time that its better than the last one. However, 3 races in and this has happened every race which is ruining it for me (but i never really play the career anyway). Im not sure why but i seem to be slow as hell compared to the computer in one turn on every track, its not as bad online but ill concede that im slow somewhere. The CPU just rams the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you . . even in straight lines and YOU get given the penalty! Ive not experiemented with turning flags totally off but i think it calls for it as ive had some pretty good races ruined. All in all, The game is pretty good, i like the new incentive to play the practice sessions and the car dev in the career mode and the racing has always been good in all of them when you work with the nuances. Yep. Solid effort.For my wish list for the next one, more of a tutor mode for people who want to really drill the hell out of laps, there was an amazing feature in motogp07 where you wound back ur position on the track in increment steps and could  keep replaying corners over and over. This is what i want cos we all know the time trials are where its at and ghosted lobbies.			"

												For me the first night playing this game has been a flawless launch-n-play no non-sense just drive experience.My Xbox 360 controller got detected automatically with the normal button mapping. The graphic settings got selected at Medium for my system and I had a smooth 100fps on a GTX 680, i7-2600K @ 3.4GHz with 16GB RAM. I went straight into matchmaking and it found a match swiftly. The online experience was smooth even at 22 players from all over the world. North America, Europe, Asia and South America all in the same session. Lag was not an issue as the cars become ghosts when they lag or crash.Overall a super fun frustration-free first online experience. The controls are great with a gamepad; The car feels heavy and grounded. And it looks great at Medium settings.UPDATE:Game is 500% better after disabling all voice acting.			"

												Taking the superb handling simulation from F1 2015 and bringing back everything F1 2015 lacked (such as career mode, safety car...), F1 2016 is quite simply the best F1 simulation on the market right now. The visuals, while not quite as nice as Project CARS', are still among the best to be found on any current generation game, and definitely the best seen yet in any F1 game (and with no ugly filters like F1 2015's chromatic aberration and blurry soft focus filtering, visuals here are crystal clear).What Project CARS is to track racing simulators in general, what DIRT Rally is to rally simulators, that's what F1 2016 is to F1 simulators. And that's one of the best endorsments anyone can give to a racing game.			"

Posted: August 19, 2016
												This is my indepth review of F1 2016, sorry for the length but enjoy reading!!F1 2016 adds depth to that detail, its career mode returning after a year's absence more fully featured and less fussy than before. From the outset you're free to sign up with any team on the grid, electing to help push Manor that little bit further up the grid or maintain Mercedes' stronghold on the top steps of the podium. Within that, there are now some neat new kinks.The UI is busy, but necessarily so - there's a lot of data to convey, and unlike previous entries it's now possible to read a race from one single screen.Perhaps F1 2016's greatest achievement is how it's managed to make practice sessions meaningful - something that's eluded many racing games before it. Sit in your cockpit in one of the three practice sessions that precede a race - all set at the correct time of day, so you'll be able to see the Singapore street circuit in a low evening sun before the floodlights kick in - and you're able to select a number of practice programmes, the successful completion of which will net you resource points you can then spend on improving the car.The programmes themselves are mini-games that don't feel out of place amidst F1 2016's quest for realism. Simulate a qualifying run by hitting a set time over three laps; acclimatise to the track by hitting gates that mark out the entry, apex and exit point of each corner; take a set of boots and prove you can tread gently in three laps of tyre management. F1 2016 could certainly benefit from a little more variety in the tasks it gives you in these sessions, but Codemasters has succeeded in injecting purpose in a race weekend outside of what happens on Sunday afternoon once the lights are out.Outside the races themselves there's some slim but effective extras: the virtual paddock from F1 2010 returns, complete with a roster of familiar faces (Eric Boullier! Toto the Wolf! Maurizio ""I'd kill to look like you when I'm 60"" Arrivabene!), and it's here you can keep tab on contract offers, how you're faring against your team mate, and other rivalries that crop up over the course of a season. F1 2016 generally does a better job of immersing you in the wider world of F1, from the cutaways before each race that take in the bustle of the grid to the post-race formalities. Codemasters' engine might struggle to render flesh and bone the way it does carbon fibre and steel - witness the sallow-skinned, dead-eyed horror of many of its character models - but the effort is appreciated all the same.When all of F1 2016's elements work together, it can make for some real magic. Take one particular race early on in my own campaign. A downpour before the lights in Shanghai leading to a sodden track (one area where F1 2016 deviates from the real thing, thankfully, is that Charlie Whiting's not on hand to make sure you can't have some fun in the rain), with the first 8 laps taking place in treacherous conditions before the skies brighten. As lightening burns its way into the track it's a game of nerves, waiting for someone to blink until Sergio Perez is the first onto intermediates, a notification popping up that he's just set the fastest lap by some margin kick-starting a mad dash for the pits. Lose yourself to it and you can easily convince yourself this is the best F1 game on console in an age.There are still faults to be found. The AI sometimes makes some funky calls - with two laps to go of one race and running in second place well clear of any competitors I was told switching over to a third tyre compound would be the optimum strategy at that point, an offer I politely declined - and it's still an F1 game that's complete with all the limitations and restrictions that particular licence implies. If you've any love for the sport, however, F1 2016 can be exquisite stuff. So intoxicating have I found its take on the sport that for me this isn't just Codemasters' most accomplished F1 game to date - it's the developer's best take on circuit racing since the heady days of the TOCA series.

												One of the best AAA launches I have experienced over the past few years. And certainly the best, most comprehensive F1 game I have played (since 2012), if not THE BEST ever.I will update the review with more hours put in, but as of now, here are my early impressions.Pros - 1. Superb presentation - cosmetic elements, ""character"" etc in the career mode brings life to the single player gameplay, something a lot of simulators ignore now-a-days.2. Still early days, but I have faced zero technical issues, no stuttering or FPS drops, no crashes, no bugs or glitches. A refereshingly stable AAA release as far as I am concerned. (Win 10, 6700K, Strix 1070, 32GB)3. Plethora of settings to tweak realism, assists, controls and difficulty - lets you enjoy the game exactly how you want. Again, something that is lacking in most indie or AAA games these days.4. Codemasters have been listening to their players. This game is choke-ful of community requested features that multiply the feeling of authenticity of the F1 experience it offers.5. Gorgeous yet un-demanding graphics.6. I am no expert when it comes to handling / physics etc. Sold my G27 for a XBONE controller sometime ago to save space. However I am having lot of fun driving in this game, more so than 2013 - 2015, which is all that matters to me.Cons -1. So far, the only thing I find lacking is car sounds. I have no idea if the current car audio is ""realistic"" or not, since I have never driven an actual open-wheel car. But for a videogame, the audio can be much more impressive. The ambient sounds are perfect though._______In conclusion, F1 2016 seems like the culmination of years of development of this series. A near-perfect F1 / Racing game. Well done Codemasters.			"

												I've been playing this series for many years and I have to say they got a lot of things right this time.  The cars are fun to drive, and the AI seems pretty challenging for all types of drivers.  The tracks are great, and thank goodness Germany is back in the mix!  The enhanced menu for making changes to the car while driving is GREAT.For the most fun, career is the way to go.  My only complaints about career mode are 1. The tedious repetition of the laptop, phone calls, and challengers (we should be able to pick our rivals with more XP given for more difficult rivals) 2. There is no bonus R&D given for winning the championship !?!The game is fun, I use the XBOX 360 controller and it seems to work well.All in all, this is the one F1 game I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun racing game ***If you have a very powerful computer***			"

												First time writing a review on Steam. There are couple of bugs here and there - sound issues, safety car not showing up after a big crash, session info ""Tyre test starts at the beggining of next lap"" sometimes stay shown even after the session started...However,THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC! Codies got it finaly right after the disappointment of 2014 and 2015, was super hyped for the game, done 10hrs already and looking forward to make it at least 1000... Updated practice sessions are not boring anymore but perfect for understanding the car's behaviour - as it should be, updated handling is really good and you can really enjoy the drive even at 100% race lengths. Good job Codies, I am f**king proud of you!			"

												Although the past couple of years left a bitter taste, I decided to take a leap of faith and get the F1 2016 game on pre-purchase offer and it was a good decisionI've only played 5 hours of the game and the impressions are so much better than 2014/2015 versions.Here are the things I most enjoyed during this short amount of time:The career mode is what makes it all fun, choose a low-end team and race your way to the top;Personalize your driver by choosing name, looks, nationality and obviously an Ayrton Senna like helmet;You can develop the car (R&D) along the practice seasons by completing some goals that will also help you to drive better;Control your entire career through your laptop;Beating your teammate is always rewarding;Get the best out of your car at the start of the race by feeding the throttle and releasing the clutch at the exact moment;Watch the pre-race and post-race actions.There are some downsides also:The AI keeps hammering your rear wing under braking, so annoying;There is still lots of wheel spin making it too arcade;After the rain, the track starts to dry slowly and naturally but then hits a turning point where it gets completely dry out of the blue and it is hard to define which strategy to follow.The FFB could be improved, the loose center is still there when using a G27 for example.Overall, it is a good game and in one weekend, I've already played it much more than the previous two versions.

												Codemasters have learnt a lesson from DiRT Rally's success. They've given the more hardcore racers something to enjoy while also making it accesible to everyone. Everygame since 2013 has been disappointing, this new career mode is what we've been missing since 2010 and the handling model is almost spot on. You can feel the extra aero on a RedBull compared to the McLaren and the subtle differences in power output from the different engine manufacturers make almost every car handle uniquely enough to make them not feel like reskins. 8/10 would recommend to a friend.

												So far I've only done two 25% races at Australia. But so far things are looking good.I've been a little critical of Codies F1 games in the past. The reason for this is I'm a huge Geoff Crammond fan and always felt that Codemasters F1 games were a bit lacking compared to the Grand Prix series of games. Sure, they've always had better presentation than Crammond's Grand Prix series, but the driving just wasn't there. Sometimes it felt like the car wasn't even connected to the track. On top of this we had a very poor AI system.Starting with f1 2015 I felt that the handling model in Codies F1 games was starting to find it's sweet spot. It's not what I'd think of as ""realistic"" but it's got a nice balance. F1 2016 improves upon it. It's a much more pleasurable thing to drive now, and the car feels less like you're driving a bus. Couple this with an excellent career mode, better AI and new features like a slightly more advanced damage model and you have a very, very good F1 game.I liked it so much that I bought it on PC and PS4.

												UPDATE: Once I went to some of the higher difficulty levels to enjoy it more, I started to hate this game a bit. A.I., yep it's crap in lots of situations, but those that made me kill the f1 process and wait till A.I. Codenoobs update was - the flippin car won't move out of your way when you're in fast lap and they are not, it ruined so many perfect laps. Also in the race, if there is a crash in 99% of situations it will be you AND caused by A.I. crashing YOU, but nobody else. I'd still recommend it overall with a big BUT.This is the F1 game, the one we've been waiting for since Codemasters got the licence. It has a few quirks, but overall it's a massive improvement over previous games:- driving model, oh yes, steering wheel is finally the way to play this and it feels so natural compared to older games where you knew it's designed for controller and playing it with wheel just didn't feel fun, you'll get a proper feedback about what happens between the car and surface- active car development, player has complete control over what and how is developed- career - it's back, it's massive, it has tons of features and free practice is now the part where you WANT to spend a lot of time inBe aware of some minor bugs at the moment and A.I. weird moments, but still - much better than before. Nothing that can't be patched. It's new ""Dirt Rally"" in F1 world, you have my recommendation.I'll update the review as I progress.			"

Posted: September 2, 2016
												An excellent addition to the F1 series by Codemasters. The last one I played was 2013, and having read the reviews for '14 & '15 I was glad to have missed them out. Short review: I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of racing sims in general, and obviously to those who like motorsports. This is the game we've all been waiting for.What immediately strikes you as you jump into Career Mode is the amazing feel of the cars and the sense of detail within the simulation. The set up of the car, in combination with the tyres, temperature, fuel weight and engine setting all play a significant factor on how the car performs. It can be a little daunting at first, but in practice there are three 'practice programs' that help you learn the tracks, and how to conserve your tyres, and what sort of times you'll need to achieve in qualifying. These programs continue to be of use even for those who master the car and track as they provide R&D points which can be used to upgrade the car as the season goes on. As such, as your season progresses, other teams may catch up with you, or you may leave them behind, and the likes of Mercedes are not guaranteed to dominate season after season.The races themselves are fantastic: the AI, whilst not perfect, provides an enjoyable, consistent challenge. It's certainly the most lifelike AI I've ever seen in a racing game. I've seen three cars attack corners at the same time, all exchanging positions, and I've been overtaken through late breaking etc. The AI can sometimes be a bit timid and give you too much space on lower difficulties - but once you start playing on expert, the AI really does provide an almost human like challenge. The biggest issue with the AI is that the jump up to the next difficulty can feel a little too much at times. This means that you might find yourself overachieving on one difficulty setting, but really struggling on the next difficulty up. The implementation of sliders would greatly help with this problem, but it is unlikely that we'll see such a system any time soon.By putting the damage setting to 'simulation' you'll witness fairly frequent (virtual) safety cars. In my last race in Canada there was two SCs following two crashes on T1 and T2 of the first lap, as well as for a mechanical failure late in the race. The SCs helped me conserve my tyres, so I was able to use a 1-stop strategy, which helped me finish in 3rd with a Renault, whilst my teammate got 5th. Other races haven't quite gone so well: at Monaco a rainy start called for intermediate tyres, but I was too quick to jump to slicks when the track dried and I lost quite a bit of time, finishing outside the points. Basically, anything can happen in a race: good fortune or bad luck, so you'll find yourself doing well some races but poorly in others - and the AI likewise struggles and benefits from certain conditions. This makes career mode far more enjoyable, since it's unpredictable and realistic, making the game very replayable.The graphics are very nice - not had any trouble with them following a couple of patches and updating drivers. This isn't an area of the game I'm usually too fussy about, but you can really see the effort Codemasters have made with the game, and it really does enhance the experience. I would say, however, that the sound of the game could do with some work. Bugs have made the sound a bit wonky at times, and the levels are not quite right, especially when passing other cars who are in the pits. Codemasters have already patched many bugs and addressed most issues, so I'm fairly confident that these issues will no longer be relevant in a few months time. In addition to career mode there is custom championships and time trial, although I haven't touch either game mode yet. There is obviously multiplayer - but I've never enjoyed racing games online, so again can't comment on that. To round this off I would say this is the best F1 game yet, it has fantastic replayability, graphics and gameplay. The simulation is the best it's ever been, and the practice programs are extremely useful tools for teaching people the tracks and how to drive quickly and smoothly. Whilst the difficulty settings could do with some tweaking and a few bugs in the sound department ironed out, this game is undoubtedly the new benchmark for the F1 series and is as good as a game we could have wished for.

												F1 2016 is easily the best edition in the Codemasters F1 series that keeps pulling me back in to keep racing the way the previous titles couldn't. I mainly play sports career games, so a big welcome return in the player career mode where you can race as yourself amongst the field that was missing from 2015. The game allows you to somewhat design your own helmet, pick a number that isn't taken by the existing grid and a best-fit driver avatar before picking a team and getting the main game underway. It's obvious this is where Codemasters spent the time this year.Instead of breezing through practice, skipping straight to qualifying like days of old, you are now expected to earn research points via practice programmes that are spent to add updates to your car throughout the season. It is a requirement as the teams around you are continually developing their cars, so you need to too to keep pace. The programmes consist of tyre management, which provides you on tyre wear data for the race as well as research points, track aclimitisation and qualifying runs. They do a great job at making practice interesting and giving you tasks to do during practice helps with the immersiveness of the career.On a gameplay side, Codemasters have done a good job at portraying each car's strength, with the difference between say the Mercedes and Manor noticable, but not blindingly obvious. The handling of the cars feels good and overall the driving is solid. I found this not to be the case on a controller though, with the gamepad just not providing enough responsiveness to race quickly or competitively. It is good to see the safety car return too, this time fully controllable unlike previous versions as well as the new virtual safety car. Manual starts also make for good variation at the beginning of races and again just feels that bit more realistic waiting for the lights to go out.One area I am disappointed in is the difficulty options of the game. I find myself too quick for Expert difficulty but way too slow for Legend. It really feels like their should be a middle ground option between these two as I have seen many say the same.Presentation and graphics looks nice albeit the same as F1 2015. Bug fixes have been made since the game's release as well as improvements which suggests Codies are really listening to fans this year after taking their input in the game's design. Overall, F1 2016 is the best Formula 1 experience out there for me, and will keep you racing for a long time.8/10.			"

												Much better than the last F1 games and very fun and easy (at least for me ;)) to drive with a wheel. (in my case logitech force gt). Once you find a fitting difficulty setting (can take some time), the game is very fun. AI is very realistic, the driving itself also realistic. Of course its no simulator but its way more realistic than need for speed ;) Everything is explained well, there are some tutorial videos to watch. The only negative aspect:Bad optimisation for PC and no SLI-Support. Thats very bad but i hope they will deliver sli support in a future update.4K:Works very well with 4K besides the bad optimisation.			"

												Great game, been looking for a good racing game for a while and saw this, i like f1 so i got it. It's great. The controls are good and you can talk to your race engineer with a microphone, though this can sometimes be iffy. The game features the creation of your own driver, allowing you to get a better feeling of imersion in the game as you are your own driver down to helmet patterns, driver number, name and the team you start off with. also features a seperate career if you prefer driving as your favourite drivers. Game runs well and so far (FPS is lowered in the paddock before sessions though, although that doesnt matter) i've only had 1 crash (of the game not the car) so far in the ammount of time i have played the game.The driving is also really good, it lets you customise almost every aspect of driving, allowing aids for anti locking breaks and traction control aswell as displaying the racing line if needed. The game also features complete customisation of the length of a race weekend, allowing full qualifying sessions, and even a full race where you do the number of laps done by the real drivers on a race weekend, though it allows this to be reduced to half of the race, a quarter or 5 lapts for people lacking that ammount of time. I can't comment on the improvements over F1 2015 as i have not played it, however i can say this is an extremely solid racing game.			"

You really stepped it up this year.Reviewed after around 13 hours of gameplay incuding a quick race at spa, 4 rounds of career mode (full qualifying, full practice, 50% race) and a few online sprint races + Beautiful Graphics, more realistic styling than F1 2015+ Good A.I, racing is slightly worse but they make many more strategy decision+ Safety Car + Virtual Safety Car+ More options for speaking to the engineer+ Multifunctional display is miles better than is previous games+ Very detailed R&D development + Good character models+ Characters are voiced well+ Commentators have more varied commentary+ Laptop function is cool+ Good testing programms+ More A.I difficulty settings+ Variable race strategies+ Improved damage model, including wheel tethers+ Personalised 10 year career mode+ Ability to upgrade your team so that it is improved on overall standing+ Multiplayer connection is greatly improved+ Manual starts+ Formation Lap+ Physics are much less arcadey than they where last year, much harder to drive+ Much better and more realistic kerb physics+ Very good wet weather driving physics+ Includes all 22 drivers, cars and liveries of the 2016 F1 season- Car sounds are a mixed bag: Honda sounds great, Mercedes sounds pretty horrific, Ferrari and Renault both sound ok- Sometimes the damage model is still too forgiving- Target times for practice programms are sometimes too high- A.I. are faster in qualifying than the race and even faster in practice- A.I. set some unrealistic times in practice and qualifying, for example being high up in a not so great car on the slower tire- My wheel (Logitech G27) is sometimes reset to 900 degrees during sessions for no reason- Online penalty system is still a mixed bag- Warming up tyres and brakes on the formation lap seems to be irrelevant because the game resets the grid fully before the race start- Car models seem a little off- Sound bugs when in a big group of cars- No classic contentAll in all this years F1 game is well worth a purchase for fans of the series and motorsport fans in general.9/10			"

												First time writing a review on Steam. There are couple of bugs here and there - sound issues, safety car not showing up after a big crash, session info ""Tyre test starts at the beggining of next lap"" sometimes stay shown even after the session started...However,THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC! Codies got it finaly right after the disappointment of 2014 and 2015, was super hyped for the game, done 10hrs already and looking forward to make it at least 1000... Updated practice sessions are not boring anymore but perfect for understanding the car's behaviour - as it should be, updated handling is really good and you can really enjoy the drive even at 100% race lengths. Good job Codies, I am f**king proud of you!			"

												This game is realy great! It looks great, its sounds great and even the whole gameplay is great!It's the best F1 game in years! The free practise is finally more usefull then just learning the track. You can develop your car and doing some other tests (in career mode). The formation lap is a awesome feature! During the race you can change pitstop strategy (I did not figured out how and which button to use) but thats because of me :)This game is harder to play on keyboard then the 2014 game, so a wheel or other game controller is needed. Skip the F1 2015 game if you still want to buy it -> This game is 100 times better!			"

The only cons are the controller settings - I'm playing with a PS4 Controller or with a Microsoft Sidewinder Wheel (~12 years old). Both work with a little adjustment.			"

												F1 2016 is easily the best edition in the Codemasters F1 series that keeps pulling me back in to keep racing the way the previous titles couldn't. I mainly play sports career games, so a big welcome return in the player career mode where you can race as yourself amongst the field that was missing from 2015. The game allows you to somewhat design your own helmet, pick a number that isn't taken by the existing grid and a best-fit driver avatar before picking a team and getting the main game underway. It's obvious this is where Codemasters spent the time this year.Instead of breezing through practice, skipping straight to qualifying like days of old, you are now expected to earn research points via practice programmes that are spent to add updates to your car throughout the season. It is a requirement as the teams around you are continually developing their cars, so you need to too to keep pace. The programmes consist of tyre management, which provides you on tyre wear data for the race as well as research points, track aclimitisation and qualifying runs. They do a great job at making practice interesting and giving you tasks to do during practice helps with the immersiveness of the career.On a gameplay side, Codemasters have done a good job at portraying each car's strength, with the difference between say the Mercedes and Manor noticable, but not blindingly obvious. The handling of the cars feels good and overall the driving is solid. I found this not to be the case on a controller though, with the gamepad just not providing enough responsiveness to race quickly or competitively. It is good to see the safety car return too, this time fully controllable unlike previous versions as well as the new virtual safety car. Manual starts also make for good variation at the beginning of races and again just feels that bit more realistic waiting for the lights to go out.One area I am disappointed in is the difficulty options of the game. I find myself too quick for Expert difficulty but way too slow for Legend. It really feels like their should be a middle ground option between these two as I have seen many say the same.Presentation and graphics looks nice albeit the same as F1 2015. Bug fixes have been made since the game's release as well as improvements which suggests Codies are really listening to fans this year after taking their input in the game's design. Overall, F1 2016 is the best Formula 1 experience out there for me, and will keep you racing for a long time.8/10.			"

												Much better than the last F1 games and very fun and easy (at least for me ;)) to drive with a wheel. (in my case logitech force gt). Once you find a fitting difficulty setting (can take some time), the game is very fun. AI is very realistic, the driving itself also realistic. Of course its no simulator but its way more realistic than need for speed ;) Everything is explained well, there are some tutorial videos to watch. The only negative aspect:Bad optimisation for PC and no SLI-Support. Thats very bad but i hope they will deliver sli support in a future update.4K:Works very well with 4K besides the bad optimisation.			"

												I'm pretty impressed with it. I generally prefer racing games that fall on the more realistic simulation side of things like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars. (More Assetto Corsa these days). I was a bit worried about how F1 2016 would feel/handle and FFB. I just spent about 40 laps at Melbourne in time trial mode getting a feel for things and once i got FFB and controls setup it feels quite good to me. I was afraid Assetto may have spoiled me with the SF15/F138 they recently released but i think the F1 cars in this game are very good and on par with the Assetto models. I only tried expert mode with all assists off and it seems quite ""realistic"" (Well as realistic as i'll ever know.. given i'll never touch one of these cars IRL)I had some intermittent issues with steering initially...1st: i had to turn my wheel all the way to get the car to turn at all.. the ratio seemed way off and too slow. found the steering saturation option and bumped it to 75 which seemed to fix that.2nd: occasionally i'd have an issue where i had zero FFB and the saturation setting above wasnt working.. It seemed to go away after crashing into something. (Using a Fanatec CSW V2) Time will tell if this persists.I'm not a huge F1 fan but watch with a passive interest. This is my first game from the official F1 series but overall i think this game is very solid. Looking forward to the career options. I dunno if you'd call it a sim or arcade or simcade, but at this point I think the physics are very good and will it will provide a lot of fun and replay-ability.Graphics look very good and i'm glad to have some unique tracks that i dont have access to from any other games like COTA and Singapore.

												I've been playing this series for many years and I have to say they got a lot of things right this time.  The cars are fun to drive, and the AI seems pretty challenging for all types of drivers.  The tracks are great, and thank goodness Germany is back in the mix!  The enhanced menu for making changes to the car while driving is GREAT.For the most fun, career is the way to go.  My only complaints about career mode are 1. The tedious repetition of the laptop, phone calls, and challengers (we should be able to pick our rivals with more XP given for more difficult rivals) 2. There is no bonus R&D given for winning the championship !?!The game is fun, I use the XBOX 360 controller and it seems to work well.All in all, this is the one F1 game I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun racing game ***If you have a very powerful computer***			"

												Credit where credit is due - after several poor efforts from F1 2014 and 2015 and much criticsm, Codemasters have taken everything that was great about F1 2013, added significant polish and then provided a Career mode that at this early stage seems to be one that will keep me interested for many weeks and months to come.I have no doubt there are bugs and glitches to be found - although I have yet to find them - but I think Codemasters deserve huge praise for this effort. There are so mnay nice touches that add to the feeling that this is game that has been nurtured and enhanced for far longer than a year. It made me chuckle when I - driving as Lewis Hamilton - ran Nico off the road and Lewis had the audacity to give him an angry hand gesture. A little thing but in conjunction with all of the additions to this game it just reinforces the feeling that this is a quality product.It is still very early days so I'm sure there is a lot more for me to discover - good and bad - but so far my only issue is the force feedback on my Logitech Force GT. I daresay the various forums will find settings and solutions in the coming days but so far, all I can feel is an annoyingly harsh rattle as if I was hitting a speedbump at speed, periodically around the track. Other than that, my first experiences with this game have been delightfully, surprisingly positive.			"

												After all these years, finally a good F1 game, return of career mode, introduction of formation lap, manual start, and manualy controled safety car laps.+graphics+physics+minor custom career features (avatar, custom number)+stable and working multiplayer-only one driver profile in career mode, can't start multiple careers (might only bother me) "

												- Very fun and addicting game!- Extreme graphics to the cars and the track. Human graphics could be improved.- G27 or other steering wheel makes the game so realistic!- Sadly, no cross-platform.- Multiplayer matchmaking is not too good. Hard to find a game.- Amazing UI.- The computer players are very aggresive compared to 2015.Great game, gonna play it a lot. Some things could be improved, but still recommended!			"

												Well I gamble by pre ordering this game thinking that it would surely be much more better than f1 2015, and boy did the gamble payoff. this game is lightyear better than the last game. the graphic looks best ever. the gameplay is also abouslute fantastic, with the AI actually act like they were real driver, and also love the new feature of manual start and formation lap. I also very happy they bring back career mode after going a year of hiatus. and it look like they gone back to the old f1 game where you can interact with your agent and talk to the team. and in a way I felt this look even more better than the old f1 game. overall i give it 9/10 on this game because although everything in the single player department of the game deserve 10/10, it the online that will still need to be fix and as long as that won't be fix, I won't give a 10/10 in this game			"

												F1 fans and racing enthusiasts probably know this already but this is a great racing game and a worthy F1 game. It runs buttery smooth at the highest settings with a GTX 970 G1.A joy to play, especially when racing in wet conditions.The (virtual) safety car is buggy though. You need to meet a delta pace and often when slowing down to do so there will be a car that overtakes and you are screwed because that place is gone (while you should get it back).Besides that flaw it is really, really good and recommended.

Well I'm happy I didChange FOV - CheckNo more silent FFB on the straights (better and more feedback all around)- Check (please give more FFB options, I want to feel more road effects, less curbs, better traction)Turn off or down motion blurr, head shake, etc - CheckBetter sound - Check (still not perfect)Safety car - checkFormation lap - CheckNOT brain dead AI - Check (well mostly)You get the idea, all around great job Codies, F1 is about 87% towards being the game fans have been dreaming it should be.

												Pretty good game. The new R&D feature in the career mode gives it that extra depth that you're usually looking for in a racing game. I really like the handling model and all the in-game features. Looks and feels great. I do however feel that you can upgrade your car too fast, a bottom tier team can easily be battling for the win by the end of season 1/beginning of season 2 if you spend a lot of time on R&D and it feels somewhat unrealistic. The progression system could be slowed down a bit especially since you have 10 seasons to play. Sometimes just experience really random small bugs & freezes but nothing too major.  "

												Even if it's a simcade, it's a pretty good one. The netcode is good, the handling is good (maybe on the wheel moreso than on the gamepad), the AI has its issues but is still the best in the extended genre and you can get a few seasons' worth of enjoyment out of it until you realize just how shallow and limited the career mode is.Do be ready to call for restarts a lot in multiplayer if you're racing with friends against AIs like I did though. It's pretty much become a meme among us by now due to their tendency to annihilate at least one of us at some point during a race.			"

Handling model feels good, I use a controller though so I can't speak for wheel support. AI feels a little odd at times as far as locking themselves onto the racing line. Overall one of the best F1 games in many years.			"

I had my doubts that this one would be better even with codemaster's saying they knew they got it wrong and making a survey for the fans about what features they wanted months before it came out but they have actually pulled it off. They went from 2015 being the worst F1 game I've ever played, to 2016 being the best one I've ever played. The customization options are better, the driving is more fun, practice is actually engaging and now with the new way it allows you to earn R&D points to develop your car the career mode is better than ever. Online still has lots of the usual issues with casual online games but seems to be pretty good, not tried it for league racing though just casuals so no idea how well it will hold up when you aren't playing with random people who can just crash you and leave the game, probably a lot better.

												First Codemasters F1 game I've bought since 2013 having been disappointed by a glitchy throttle and force feedback (G27) and physics that weren't at all believable (I'm pretty sure with no TCs I should be able to wheel spin off the line...).Well, what a revelation 2016 has turned out to be! Rear tyres that want to light up, believable and predictable handling, stunning graphics and a game that truly captures the atmosphere of F1 (your team even deploys pit boards!). For me the handling is the star of the show. It may not be a full on sim like Assetto Corsa, but it rewards accurate driving whilst still being a little forgiving.The career mode is really nice, with programs to run in practice to hone your skills and the set up whilst earning development points. I can see myself putting in many hours to win the WDC with Manor!			"

												I want two things from racing games: Realistic simulation and Exciting races. This game perfectly fufills the simulation aspect. The car feels powerful, and it's thrilling to push it to its limit. Coming into corners at 210 mph, slamming on the brakes, then speeding up again is an unreal experience. As for races, they are generally great, but not always. An example of a great one was when I was racing in Russia. There were 7 laps remaining and I was 10 seconds behind Vettel. I was gaining by 1.3 seconds a lap, and it was intense. I eventually caught up and passed him on the penultimate corner. The race was exciting and everything I want from a game. Unfortunately this is not always the case. Many times I've just got caught in a position with a 10 second gap ahead and behind. This creates a boring race that is more of a chore than a joy to complete.Despite sometimes encountering a boring race, F1 2016 fufills everything I want from an F1 game.			"

												Let me start off by saying i am a huge f1 fan and have been playing f1 games since 2003. Im pleased to say this game is a huge improvement on all the earlier games and is by far the best in the series. Pros : Graphics are stunning, Being able to develop your car in career mode is a great feature although not completely perfect, damage model is a large step up with simulation damage being realistic, Handling is well done and fairly easy to get used to, Voice control feature is easy to use and very helpful.   Cons: Modding is very difficult, Ai can be reckless and sometimes tries to overtake when there is no spot to overtake, Overall fully recommend this game			"

												Best F1 game ever, puts the rest in the dust.I'm overall enjoying the new career mode, something that 2015 lacked,graphics have also got better, specially while racing in the rain, it's way more realistically looking.Codemasters has also been showing a lot of support for the game, with weekly patches who fixes minor bugsand adding stuff like the newest ''Master'' difficulty added with the 1.7 patch.The game also plays well with a controller (tested with an X360 Controller) and for a much better feeling, get a Sterring Wheel (using a Logitech Driving/Formula Force EX here, no issues, Force Feedback is also well done)I do reccomend picking it up, no regrets			"

												Last year I wrote a really scathing review for F1 2015, which I felt was not just the worst codies F1 game but also just the worst AAA F1 game I've ever played. I had my doubts that this one would be better even with codemaster's saying they knew they got it wrong and making a survey for the fans about what features they wanted months before it came out but they have actually pulled it off. They went from 2015 being the worst F1 game I've ever played, to 2016 being the best one I've ever played. The customization options are better, the driving is more fun, practice is actually engaging and now with the new way it allows you to earn R&D points to develop your car the career mode is better than ever. Online still has lots of the usual issues with casual online games but seems to be pretty good, not tried it for league racing though just casuals so no idea how well it will hold up when you aren't playing with random people who can just crash you and leave the game, probably a lot better. Overall I definitely recommend this game, the most fun and engaging F1 game yet.			"

You have to use analog accelarator and brakes so you can manage your tires wear better.			"

												Annual sports franchises are difficult to know when to jump in. Have they just update the drivers and car liveries, have they broken what worked before or worst of all have they stripped out all but the most basic features.F1 2016 takes the promise of a next-gen F1 game that 2015 failed to deliver and improves in almost every way.I'm not an online racer so career mode is where it is at for me. This is not only back but has been seriously upgraded. Teams can now be developed so seasons do vary with Mercedes not always staying on top. As part of this they have managed to make one of the most skipped parts of the game, practice sessions, now mean something as this is where you can earn upgrade points. The challenges in the sessions make sense, are fun and teach you about the course and an F1 car.None of this would matter if the racing wasn't up to scratch but Codemasters have made it very fun to race. The cars handle as you would expect with the margin between sublime cornering and spinning out of control so close. The game maintains it's excellent assists systems which you can dial back as you gain more experience someone just starting out can find their balance. I tend to race with a controller and I've never felt like I get less of an experience.Finally it seems this year Codemasters are really pushing this game to be as good as it can be. I've already seen 2 changes to the game that I expected not to see till 2017. Lots of people were finding there was too big a gap between 2 difficulties so Codemasters introduced a new level to bridge the gap.So in summary this is one of the great years for this annual franchise. Maybe next year will be even better but I don't think you can go wrong jumping in this year.			"

												The game seems a lot more polished than F1 2015 straight off the back. More graphics adjustments work really well with the PC, frames are more stable and a really nice level of customisation with things as little as camera angles and time of day editors. The new career mode is really nice - from playing F1 2010's career mode they've really improved on the great aspects they used before! The AI are still good, if a little too forgiving sometimes, as well as the contact model in most cases being spot on!			"

												First Codemasters F1 game I've bought since 2013 having been disappointed by a glitchy throttle and force feedback (G27) and physics that weren't at all believable (I'm pretty sure with no TCs I should be able to wheel spin off the line...).Well, what a revelation 2016 has turned out to be! Rear tyres that want to light up, believable and predictable handling, stunning graphics and a game that truly captures the atmosphere of F1 (your team even deploys pit boards!). For me the handling is the star of the show. It may not be a full on sim like Assetto Corsa, but it rewards accurate driving whilst still being a little forgiving.The career mode is really nice, with programs to run in practice to hone your skills and the set up whilst earning development points. I can see myself putting in many hours to win the WDC with Manor!			"

												Pretty good game. The new R&D feature in the career mode gives it that extra depth that you're usually looking for in a racing game. I really like the handling model and all the in-game features. Looks and feels great. I do however feel that you can upgrade your car too fast, a bottom tier team can easily be battling for the win by the end of season 1/beginning of season 2 if you spend a lot of time on R&D and it feels somewhat unrealistic. The progression system could be slowed down a bit especially since you have 10 seasons to play. Sometimes just experience really random small bugs & freezes but nothing too major.  "

												Even if it's a simcade, it's a pretty good one. The netcode is good, the handling is good (maybe on the wheel moreso than on the gamepad), the AI has its issues but is still the best in the extended genre and you can get a few seasons' worth of enjoyment out of it until you realize just how shallow and limited the career mode is.Do be ready to call for restarts a lot in multiplayer if you're racing with friends against AIs like I did though. It's pretty much become a meme among us by now due to their tendency to annihilate at least one of us at some point during a race.			"

												I've been playing F1 games and simulations all the way back to Grand Prix and Grand Prix 2. That being said I always look forward to a new game that tries to bring you that much more closer to the real life of a Formula 1 driver, and that much closer to realism. Every year since they got the rights I want to like Codemasters' effort into bringing me that experience and every year I get disappointed. It's not the game itself it's the 'effort'. Bugs, always. Lack of logic, always. They always seem to be their own worst enemy when developing these games. Don't LikeWet weather is better but still the game engine lacks the logic to know when it is wet and safe enough to run dry tires. If water is splashing up, it is NOT safe for dry slicks. My first wet race I was so excited then as the track (presumably) started to dry the AI switched to drys with mist still coming off my intermediates. WTF.The hospitality scenes. I get it, you want to make us feel like racing drivers but the whole cell phone, manager and engineer bit is just repetitive and annoying. Give me a first person view and be able to walk around the area, interact with people on my own for more immersion. Maybe I can call my manager and see if any teams are hiring (if i want to move). Maybe I can interact with the engineers to get more info from them on how to set up the car.No practice starts or focus on starts. Way too easy to get these cars off the line. There should be more focus on practicing your starts and if you don't get it right your car goes nowhere on the start.Pit stops need more interaction from the driver. Stopping long, short or leaving early/too late.I won't comment on my own experiences with my video card (can't overclock, crashes to desktop) because I think that is unfair given that is pretty much subjective.My likesDrivability is pretty 'arcade'. In my opinion Assetto Corsa or iRacing will get you to closer to the real feel of these cars sliding around BUT I like how forgiving they are even with TC off and using a gamepad. Progression is fun and doesn't make you feel like a losing battle as in previous years. In McLaren I am in the top 10 which by all means is not realistic but still it's your own adventure.Damage is much better and fun that it is easier to destroy your car because that's just how it really is.Ai is a lot more fun to race with.Even though I commented above about the weather dynamics and 'logic' around it,  it is much much more improved. The water drips off the mirrors and reacts so much nicer then anything else I've played.---I probably could talk so much more about this game. In the end if you love F1 then yeah I think it's ok. If you aren't, I still think this game will give you a good experience into the sport. "

												Introduction:If you are watching F1 grand prix including the practice sessions, and qualifying sessions and allways wanted to be in the shoes of some of the drivers from this year or in the future, this game will suit you. Carreer mode:F1 2016 includes all of the drivers and teams from 2016, and have a deep and engaging carreer mode lasting 10 years/sessions from 2016-2026 . In the carrer mode you can choose your tire strategy for each race and customize your cars in alot of ways to help you beat the opponents in the practice sessions and qualifying. Practice sessions:The practice sessions have alot of detail, including team-objectives where you learn how to save your tires and how to drive on the apex of the circuits. After you have completed the team-objectives you will earn funds, which you can use on various parts of the car f.ex. a better engine, more optimized fuel-systems , chasis-development etc.Race:After you have completed both the practice sessions and the qualification, you can choose to run a track parade, where you can increase the temperature of the tires.The AI cars race are very good, and have been improved from 2015, so f.ex. you will have less accidents with other AI-cars at the start of the race. There are 7 difficult levels you can choose from for the AI cars: ""very easy"" to ""ultimate"".Graphics: 95 /100The graphics of F1 2016 is improved from the earlier version and includes a full time-of-day, so you can f.ex. see the sun go down and lights turn on. The game includes dynamic weather effects, so you will have to change tires in mid-race if it's raining. The tracks have alot of detail and have more details than F1 2015.Sound: 85 / 100Sound is very nice with alot of details, like the sound of rain on the hood, the abillity to hear the other F1 cars engines both on track and in pit etc. The cars could have a better engine sound though.Performance: 95 / 100On my old Phenom 955 with 8gb of ram and a Nvidia GTX 960 I have around 39 fps with ultra settings and I haven't noticed any lag like there was in F1 2015.Overall: 92 /100The best Formula One game I have ever played!

												I was looking forward to F1 2016 and boy it's good!  Graphics are more polished than F1 2015  Career mode is back with a bang. Best of the series so far.  Performance is pretty good on a 970 gtx. Getting 60 fps on ultra 1080p and 110+ fps on high with no observable difference in quality  Time of day editor is a welcome addition. Really fun playing singapore in the day time  Learning curve is really steep, especially with a pad. Struggling to gain traction out of corners with tc off. F1 2015 was easy to pick up and play but this one really requires practise and concentration  Car audios are much better than 2015. The McLaren sounds the best.  There are some audio bugs that I faced with a lot of cars on the grid around me. It sounded like the audio from the ai cars are choppy  Kerbs and grass are way more slippery. No more throwing the car over the corners, you will spin out!  AI are very similar to F1 2015. I didn't observe much of a difference in behaviour  Simulation damage..nuff saidF1 from codemasters is no longer arcarde. If you want a game to pick up and play, go for F1 2015. F1 2016 are for those who like to see wheel tethers (a lot! :D)			"

												This game is awesomeThe new features(Re-worked Safety car, Formation lap, R&D upgrades, Pre-purchase bonuses, etc.) were all worth preordering the game!I did see some glitches how ever, like with the R&D tests, Track aclamatazation it's a little bit glitchy, but otherwise the game is awesome!I haven't yet experienced the safetly car or the VSC, but i saw some videos with SC/ VSC gameplay and it looks awesome.I personally would have preordered the game a month ago, thats how good i think this game is :)Worth every penny!However,there are some things that I don't like, especially the cutscenes and the Comentators, or even Driver OF the Day xD. I played the game for about 10hours and its already getting slighty old. I'm just happy i can play it on my Decent laptop doe. But as i said, i think its worth buying/ preordering the game :)-Thank you,          Amon xD			"

												It's a very fun game. The cars drive well and are very predictable. The AI is decent, the graphics are great and I love the career mode. The FFB is decent, though rather numb when compared to some other current racing games/simulators such as rF2 or Assetto Corsa. However, with some profiler tweaking on my G25 I've found myself coming back to play quite often. It's not a hard core sim, but is a very fun and rewarding drive! As long as you approach it with that expectation I think most people will enjoy it immensely as I have!			"

												F1 2016 is a great F1 game. Capitalising on the great handling + graphics combination produced the year prior, Codemasters spent the last year making improvements such as adding a thrilling and customisable career mode, improving online net code to a pleasant level, and perfecting what they had already done well. It's a game for all abilities, whether this is your first racer or you are a real life motorsport driver, you can blend the ai difficulties and assists to any level to utilise the generally realistic yet pick-up-and-playable handling model. It's not perfect as I'm almost making it out to be, but I'm really looking forward to the next release from a developer that's proved it knows what it's doing now.My personal experience has been slightly altered by having a graphics card driver problem in my first months of ownership which meant quick race was the only working mode, and also with suddenly receiving every Codemasters game I've been playing with them a lot recently too. I definitely should have more hours on this than I do!(Side note: I am able to run the game at 45-55 FPS on medium settings w/ an i7 and 750Ti so it isn't too hard to run either!)Pros:Realistic and rewarding handlingGreat, and quite easy to run, graphicsLow grip situations improved (grass on tyres, wet conditions, kerbs etc.)Intriguing career modeEasy to pick-up-and-play with assistsDecent/good online qualityBest AI yet (still room for improvement though!)Minimal glitchesVastly improved damage system w/ tethers and simulation settingsCons:Unrealistic/over-realistic in some situations (grass on tyres feels like being on a wet track on dry tyres, save me!)Pad steering is IMPOSSIBLE to be smooth (If Codies could bring back the slightest steering assist to all pad players to help situations where wheel is completely OP then that'd be appreciated)Not massively moddableOP tyre glitch (look up online if you don't understand what it is)A few other little things possiblyOverall, a big recommend, even if £40 is a bit steep it'll be about half that in the sales so do capitalise on it if you can!

YouTube™ Video: F1 2016 - The ultimate F1 game? 

			Views: 100		

			F1 2016 is Codemasters' 8th iteration of a Formula 1 game, but is this the ultimate F1 game?		

F1 2016 marks Codemasters' 8th iteration of the Formula 1 title, if you include F1 2009 which bizarrely only released on the Wii. After 8 iterations has Codemasters finally made the perfect Formula 1 game?This is so far the best Codemasters F1 game to date. I had a few issues with crash to desktop where the game would just close or minimise, but on the other hand I got several hours at a time without any such issues. I also had an issue with not being able to save my progress, or even start the game because it said C drive didn't have enough space (why this was an issue, I don't know, since the game is saved to a different drive with over half a terabyte of space) but after verifying the game files and rebooting my system (and uninstalling a few megabytes worth of programs), the game seems happy again (time will tell if the crash to desktop issue returns). Overall the game runs great at a considerably higher framerate than the previous titles pushing the 100s in places and otherwise sitting at 90 fps on high settings. I'm using a GTX 780 at 1080p and the game defaulted to high settings, and on max it should give a perfectly acceptable 60 fps, so if you have a 980 like the game recommends you should get an even better experience.Graphics are improved and the attention to the real sport is great. They've successfully 'game-ified' F1 and gotten across the more important technical parts of the sport. Codemasters has made changes to the Free Practice modes and have refined the free practice objectives. Each objective you meet gives you points to upgrade your car during the season and for me, this makes free practice worth doing again. For example, the tyre wear test teaches you how to go faster and preserve your tyres. You'll find yourself improving lap after lap and yet your tyre wear will get progressively better as your driving style becomes smoother. Track acclimatisation is something else they've put in. You get a series of gates to go through around the track and the faster and more accurately you pass through them the higher your score and the more development points you get. This not only teaches you to go fast, but also correct car positioning. Your personal tyre wear data can be used to create your pit strategy during the race which is great. Speaking of pit strategies, the game can now suggest new strategies on the fly depending on what's happening in the race so it's just like the real sport. On top of all that, if that wasn't enough, tiny differences like fuel load and tyre wear make a huge difference to the handling.Development points aren't just restricted to Free Practice. Development points are up for grabs all the way through a career mode weekend, be it for meeting a team objective, completing a certain number of laps in a session, beating your rival or taking home the big prize of a race win. Your performance not only nets you development points, but affects your standing within the team on the way to the coveted number one driver. The Development Points you earn act as an R&D currency, so the better you perform, the more points you have and the faster you  can get those sweet R&D upgrades. You get to choose to the development of your team in Career Mode and as your on track performance ties into so many different things, it's important to get out there and let your driving do the talking. With a 10 season career mode you can really stamp your authority within the team.Career mode boasts a leader board section which compares you against other players, based on the points you have earned so the competitive types should get their kick out of that.AI also suffer incidents, penalties and mechanical failures which should make the racing more interesting and unpredictable (having spent almost all my time online and only just starting career mode I can't say how much it affects races and can't comment too much on AI race craft). I'm just getting stuck into the career mode and so far, so good, everything you'd expect is present, including the Safety and Virtual Safety Car, which so far, are bug free. In races, blue flag AI works as it should, unlike some of the previous titles and I had little trouble getting past in the quick races I did. The safety car is here too along with formation laps and these are all bug free and working as intended so far. The only thing I would say is on the formation lap, the AI is too fast. They will go at racing speed off the line and will overtake you if you decide to slow down to do any tyre warming. I haven't seen them attempt to do any so far, but this will be different in career mode.The game also boasts support for custom drivers now, where you pick what you look like, your number, name, three letter abbreviation etc. and while this is a great addition, it would have been nice to see some more diversity in the faces (if you know what I'm saying). This feature could be further improved by letting the player choose an audio name. Other games from Codemasters allow it, so why not here? If this was allowed the commentators and pit crew could address you by name rather than 'a *car name here*'Online is fully featured, but unfortunately sees the return of hopper lobbies for sprint races. It would have been nice to have a session list like the custom races have as too often, I leave a lobby, search for a new one and get dropped back in the same lobby. Custom sessions have no such issue as the game provides a session browser so you can make informed decisions on which lobby to join. Players online are as you'd expect in any racing game and it's a shame nothing is being done (e.g. harsher penalties and safeguards such as ghosting blue flagged opponents) to kerb negative behaviour as it ruins what could be an amazing experience.Sound design is near perfect, with the engines sounding that little bit different to each other and the turbo whine (which some may find annoying) coming through on top. Coupled with a expanded pit radio voice commands, this is a very immersive title. The Xbox One controller is supported and the cars handle brilliantly on there, especially when you have a custom setup applied. The cars are tricky to handle and you can lose the back end incredibly easily if you're not careful. Setups see the addition of Steam Workshop support. You can browse the workshop at the start of a session or race and download a setup straight into your game for use there and then. This brilliant addition means, if you're like me, and don't want to spend a long time setting the car up, you can grab one from the workshop and be on your way.  So far, F1 2016 is a great game. I could go on as there's so much more to this game than you're willing to read. It takes the sport of Formula 1 and faithfully recreates and game-ifies it in what seems to be this series' Dirt Rally moment. It brings in features fans have been asking for, makes newcomers welcome with its video tutorials and refines old features with a level of polish we haven't seen from this series in a long time. Purists can argue that the lack of a Young Driver Test is a big negative, but honestly it's removing features like that which allow me to jump into a front running team in my first season. Provided you're not unlucky like I am when it comes to your games working properly, F1 2016 shouldn't disappoint.			"

												I cant get enough of this game... Its the best F1 games ever and everyone needs to try it.Every thing thats new is what people have been wanting  and now i have never been so addicted to a game in my life. There are small faults still, like bad audio in the replay and sometimes racing against other cars. I have got this game on Ultra and there is nothing else to be turned higher.The damage is awesomes but should still have a higher setting and the tracion control is either on or off this year. You cant spin tires on medium and when its off thats all they do. There needs to be a low setting for that to allow for a little slip like in F1 2015. This game i will give a 9.5/10 because it is near perfect but still small bugs to fix Love it so much			"

I do have one issue with Esteban attacking me ""Lewis Hamilton"" as if I slapped his mother on the♥♥♥♥♥and told everyone in the schoolyard.. lol. Please Fix with patch.My only complaint is that it still needs to be optimized as is doesnt support SLI/Crossfire in 2016 and im only getting max 60 FPS and dipping into the low 50's and yes all settings are set to max.Please Codemasters, fix optimization and add support for SLI/Crossfire. For god sakes, its 2016 and people do own nice rigs to play these graphic intensive games. If you are going to make a demanding game, then incorporate the use for users hardware, it only makes sense.			"

A slight bump into the wall or even other cars can end your race real quick. It's still a bit iffy sometimes but it's sensitive enough to make contact genuinely terrifying.			"

												This game comes with a cost compared to other racing games but is well worth it. Me being a pure f1 fan and not really interested in other automobile sports, this game is great. I liked ProCars but it wasnt what I wanted just for a F1 based game mode. The graphics are great in this game and the physics are on point as well. I just sold my csgo inventory and got a pricey wheel ( Thrustmaster T150 ) and will keep updated on how I feel it is. Right now im playing with a ps3 controller and its playable but not ideal for a real simulation feeling. Overall this game is a 9.5/10 and I highly recomend this game to any F1 fan hardcore or not :)EDIT: The wheel I got makes this game amazing and more enjoyable! Im new so I play at Expert level and my qualifying laps are always 2 secs lower than the AI in career mode :)			"

As for my review, well I havent played since 2014 (obviously missing 2015) and this is I think the best of the franchise yet!  Manual starts, voice communication with pits, dynamic pit boards, smart challenging AI, rewarding practise sessions with mini-games, 10 year career, it looks amazing (as you can see from video above) plus loads more!I put together a FIRST LOOK if you want to check that out it's here, but my original game capture device failed to keep up:

												The game features an enhanced career mode that takes place over ten seasons. Specific race goals are dependent on the strength of the team, and driver rivalries develop over time. A very neat feature is practice objectives: performing specific tests (like learning the track, conserving tires, or going on a qualifying run) will earn research points that can be spent on upgrading car parts. It is a welcome feature that gives a purpose to practice other than simply turning laps. In addition to the career mode, single seasons, quick races, time trials, and online multiplayer with full twenty-two car fields are available. A number of minor new features (the Azerbaijan street circuit, new Haas team, a formation lap, manual race starts, manual pitting, and the safety car) are also added for this year’s version. Racing physics are plausible, including tire wear, handling, and damage. Driving assists can be adjusted to support a wide range of player abilities, and flashbacks can be used to rewind time if needed. AI drivers are appropriately aggressive. F1 2016 is a slick, feature-complete simulation perfect for the racing aficionado.

												This game has potential.  Unfortunately for me, It's a refund.  There are fundamental issues with the AI (Like getting hit from behind and receiving a penalty.) and a reoccuring sound issue whereby the opposition engines constantly sound like popcorn.On the positive side, the game ran without issue and the inclusion of voice commands is quite nifty. Hopefully Codies does it justice and rectifies the small things and it'll be a worthy purchase.			"

TL/DR REVIEWIn my opinion this is easily the best F1 game in the codemasters era. Don't expect a hardcore simulation, because it's clearly not. I play the game with a wheel, which enhances the experience greatly. The physics are not hyper realistic, but with all assists off (except for TC on medium) the game is realistic enough to suspend my disbelief. As with any (mainstream) racing game you shouldn't expect clean racing in online public lobbies. I spend most of my time in the time trial and the career mode, which are both very entertaining.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

												After around 30+ hours on F1 2016 I have to say this:Whilst I agree with every aspect of the gameplay excitement and its overall presentation, immersion and surroundings, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed with the graphics actually. It's a love hate-relationship there. Everything closeup looks really good-the lighting is fabulous, but everything further away becomes a blurry mess. The fuzzyness of the cutout/paste mechanics are atrocious. The lack of PROPER multi-sampling or super sampling AA options compounds this even further. Line markings in the distance are such a jaggedy-jag-jag, that it reminds me of the 90ies for crying out loud. And not to mention, that there is no SLI/Crossfire(?) support. WTF? 2016-no SLI support? Get out! 'And what about FFB Luds?'- 'edited' A plus point after some tinkering. Unlike other titles FFB is actually perfect out of the box and just requires some proper dampening setup in the according controller driver and you can truly feel the lateral movements and weightshifts of the car. Quite impressive. AMS and RRE feel a little more involving overall still, but this title has the best dampening FFB impression, which helps wet races immensely, a lot of fun. For me the game is fantastic to play, but keep in mind I enjoyed GP2 as well and heck it did not look anywhere nearly as good as this. However, if this game would use the engine of F1 2014 it would be the final word in F1 simulations IMO and they would not need to make another. So yeah - I LOVE THIS GAME, but am a little disappointed to see the OVERALL rather lackluster effect-grabbing, technically underwhelming graphics of this game. Gameplay/Immersion: 10/10 (updated to MAX after I truly played multiplayer-fantastic!)Sound: 8/10Graphics: 5/10FFB: 8/10 (updated -> had some minor brain underpowering setting it up correctly.)Overall(based on above): 31/40 - 77.5%I recommend this game for the gameplay/the options/the adjustability/the sheer racing immersion and excitement. Again I am just disappointed, because I thought the game engine is two steps forwards and one big step backwards.			"

												This is a light hearted review, nothing to be taken to seriously but before I get into that, I would fully suggest buying this game if you're a F1 fan, I've spent 8 hours in total in the game and I've only just completed the first GP, FP1 and the rest actually mean something now and the AI are somewhat competent enough to respond to your moves. Now for the things that amused me.Seriously now though, within the first 4 laps of race day Lewis pinched me off track to overtake resulting in a nasty 720 spin and a puncture, didn't even get a penalty! (Realism, eh!? ;) )""Shut up Jeff!"" totally works too, never had more fun asking for more updates and then telling him to shut up half a lap later, made the straights a little bit more entertaining when I wasn't close enough to creep up the inside of the car ahead. Lewis didn't get 1st place on the podium yet still jumped around and celebrated, that's certainly a minus in the realism points... (Lewis gets some flak in this review, before you jump at me though I'm not an out and out hater of Lewis) Oh and yeah, Max double blocked me...Either codies have been hard at work or just coincidence but I had to laugh. Great game, very much an improvement over all the others.  "

If you like the sport, get it.  If you dont like it, get it and you might.  Career mode is in depth and well developed, as are the graphics.  Car handling and physics are well modeled too.  The only complaints I have is very infrequent frame rate drop outs, and some menu text disapearing every now and again.  I am sure that will be fixed soon.Overall 9/10 "

												I have owned all the F1 games from codemasters since 2012, and after the big disappointment last year with F1 2015 this years F1 2016 is actually the best one i have played so far. Career mode is here again and its very motivating to play and has a fair learning curve with the training modes and achievements. Race strategies tire management is far more easy to handle, than in the previous games. Best thing happened at my first career race in australia when i lost part of my front wing and had to pit just 2 rounds after i switched tires. The box crew automatically suggests new strategies to switch tires again in different order. Worked pretty well!Graphics are also better than last year. Running smooth on my 970 GTX in 1920x1200 with ultra details.Buy it!			"

												Came over from 2013. First thing I noticed was reduced difficultly with assists and Easy AI is easy enough for even the most spoiled participation trophy receiving millenials. No crashes or other issues such as those reported. Great game for the experienced, noobs and even for the most self entitled, must win, worst generation of all time. Take heed: R&D makes aspiring for better teams rather pointless. AI will ram you right off the track when you make a mistake so millenials may wish to turn off damage.			"

												I haven't bought an F1 game since F1 2012. I felt that they generally started to follow a formula (lolpun) and got into somewhat of a rut.I'm happy to say that this one completely smashes it out of the park. Absolutely everywhere where F1 has stumbled in the past has finally been addressed. For instance, the feeling that you were never really driving other cars during qualifying, and that it was all faked to give the illusion of a close session. All that is gone. You can now watch your AI competitors via their onboard cameras whilst parked in the pitlane.The AI feels consistent through each round of the calendar too. In previous years I would find that I would struggle to qualify in Australia, but be pole position in Bahrain. Now it feels that over the year they stay competitive. From what I am hearing too, the AI seems to pose quite a challenge. I'm only playing on Hard AI difficulty right now, but I feel like I might be able to put it up a notch soon.I think my new favourite feature for this particular outing of this franchise though, is the practice sessions. They finally feel worth doing. The track acclimatization and tyre wear tests make practice feel meaningful.I recommend anyone who has already bought the game to put the damage up from ""Full"" to ""Simulation"", (it makes no sense to me that there is a setting above full but whatever). Simulation tends to lead to more AI faults and crashes leading to two safety cars so far, one real and one virtual, but they all add to the excitement of each race. This makes the damage particuarly unforgiving however, leading to more than a few tyres hanging on by their tethers, (which looks awesome by the way).All in all, this is their best yet, and I really think this is up there with the great Geoff Crammond Grand Prix 4. I really recommend you give it a go.			"

												Here it is, what all of us has been waiting for.The perfect F1 game. Back are the ""live the life"" stuff from 2010/2011 and much more improved. The hospitality areas, the R&D and of course the fact that you can now create your own driver with it's own number that follows through you for your career.Handling has been improved to make it much more enjoyable and finally we have a damage model that makes sense.Just go ahead and buy it already, you don't be disappointed.

												10/10.Well, what can I say. After many years of feeling 'bored' with F1 games, they finaly went and hit the nail on the head with this one. Everything we asked for; formation lap, safety car, career mode, helmet customization  has all been added. But not only have they been added, they've been done correctly and not just 'thrown' in. Here's my opinion on different parts of the game.Career Mode:What can I say. I was very excited and eager to start. I was first faced with Character customization, which was simple and yet efficient. Then it was the team selection, Which I'm glad you can choose any team as it makes it more 'personal' rather than being forced your Path.R&D:As we know it, Research & Development was kind of the weakness in the past years. But this time, it brings a whole new meaning, not only do you improve. Other teams improve and even some don't. But...I honestly think R&D is too easy & too early. In my 1st season with Haas & into the 14th race. Toro Rosso was already 3rd Fastest, Which seemed a little unrealistic. But other than that, it's perfect.Safety & Virtual Safety Car:Finaly. it's back! F1 2015 felt rushed without the safety car, although the Graphics was massively improved from 2014 and some will even argue they're still the best to this day for CM. With it completely been re-done, it feels much better. Although at times, it doesn't come out when it should and it comes out when it shouldn't. In my 2 seasons I've only had 1 VSC, so other than it being rare. I can't really give feedback other than it worked great when it did happen.But yeah that's it. The Game is great again. Thanks. "

												I am unable to review this game because I literally can not get it to play. I have tried to load a career mode twice and both times I got a crash to desktop at the exact same spot, I've look on the game discussion forums and many people are reporting the exact same issue and have been reporting it for 2+ months and no fix has been released. I don't recommend this game if you have a Nvidia graphics card (as that is what this game breaking bug seems to be centered around)			"

												Second review hype!I am a long time racing fan. I've played the crap out of GT4 & GT5, and then the first few F1 Games. I played a lot of 2010 & 2011, but not as much as 2013. By far my favourite code masters game.I tried to like the previous two titles (2015 & 2014) but they were both rushed. 2014 to me felt like a rehash of 2013 with the 2014 cars and content, and 2015 felt like more a demo game engine then an actual game.This game is what 2015 should of been. 2015 laid the foundation for this wonderful game to be great, and I was really hoping code masters would publish a game that did these new V6 cars justice, and they really have. The game works great on my PC, and shows its technical advanced over the previous titles in terms of graphics and handling. I race with a G27 and triple screen setup, (980ti, 4930k, 16gb ram). This is what 2015 laid the foundation for. I have not had any crashes or noticeable bugs, and the game runs smoothly without frame drops.But they went above and beyond, the practice sessions now give me something to do instead of feeling like I'm going around and around without benefit. The cars feel great, I'm driving a manor and it feels like it should, not as well balanced as the top tier cars and definitely slower. I'm playing on hard as I used to play on pro back in 2013, and the game feels challenging but rewarding, I don't actually care that I come close to last because of the fun I'm actually having driving the car. The immersion is fantastic, getting drifty and ant to commentate as well as the formation lap, voice control and pre-race all make me feel like I'm driving in a real race weekend.The out of car stuff blows me away, the r&d, the new 'agent' and the rivalry really pull me into this game like GT5 did so many years ago, and while I can't just buy a new car like I did in that, I'm damn well committed to developing this manor into a race winning team. 10/10 would buy again.

												Pretty good so far, there are some issues however. The career doesn't save properly if you don't press advance and you quit. My save got pretty muddled up as I qualified last but got placed in 14th on the grid for the race I had to redo. Speaking of qualifying, the qualifying pace of the AI seems way too high compared to their race pace. I generally qualify about 2 seconds off my team mate whether I have assists on or off (I generally have them off appart from ABS), but in the race my team mate is always beaten by me either by me finishing higher or beacuse my sector times and best lap was way quicker and sometimes both. There also seems to be a flashback issue where in some instances it makes the tires feel like you're driving on ice. The career home section also lags like crazy dipping down to 15-20fps on my 960M (might just be mobile chips) but the races generally hover around 50 fps on a mix of high and medium settings (1080p).There are a bunch of good things though; The career mode is the best it has ever been from my experience with the RnD progression system and revamped rival system. Having VSC and Saftey Cars is amazing and the manual starts are really fun to do. The formation lap gets kinda boring however in my opinion. The multiplayer is back to what it used to be somewhat and playing on a near maxed out lobby was the most fun I've had in F1 for a long time. Overall it feels like a much more polished version of F1 2015 with the 2016 liveries, greater longevity due to the revamped career mode and better multiplayer.			"

												Finally we have a decent F1 game.I played last years version on the PS4 and it was lamentable. This years PC version is rather good. I am playing at 4k with everything maxed on on a 58inch panel and the game runs like a dream. Framerate is very smooth and it pulls infrequently. I suspect that is a bug that will be fixed. The audio gets scrambled at the same time. But this only happens for a second or two.The game looks good. Maybe the trees and stands could look a bit more lifelike.Career mode is much improved from 2014 version. Finally we can have a shorter race. I wont do 15 lapsas its too time consuming and boring. I play with the 360 gamepad and its fine. I dont get any lag.I won't do multiplayer anymore. Last year on ps4 it was better as all the other players were in ghost cars. Most frustrating for mentally unstable gamers who like to ruin games by running everyone off the road. A big problem once again is collision detection. Its awful as usual. For a simulation its perplexing why the AI is so acrade like.Overall the is an excellent game and most addictive.			"

												Well I had low expectations for this after the dismal product that was F1-2015. But this title nailed it. Yes its not a serious sim. But it has enough sim like qualities to make hardcore sim racers happy. It also has enough assists to help arcade racers too. The game looks familiar yet all new. The handling model is better than expected. I have to say that this may be the best F1 title from codies yet. I still think the colors in my modded version of 2010 look more real (even with the sweetFX enabled it looks a but cartoony) but this has all the features that have been asked for. The pit boards are near impossible to read but who cares. The fact that they pop over the wall while driving by is a cool touch.   I love the addition of the safety car (back finally) and the VSC. Weather and opponent updated from the crew are actually useful for once. The new tracks look like they should, and seem to race how they look on tv. I am most impressed with the garage and new on the fly menu options, for diff settings and wing repairs if needed. I also like the formation lap and manual start/pitstop control... nice touches.Performance wise it runs smooth as silk on my system. I have it DSR'ed in the nvidia control panel and maxed out in game. I have frame rates locked at 60 and theres no hint of a thought of a slowdown.  The only thing id like to see added is support for my track IR. Other than that its worth a buy. Its not a disappointment for once! This may finally be the F1 game that we have been asking for.			"

												Codemasters has been making F1 vidgames since 2009, now, in their 8th installation, I believe they've gotten a step closer to perfection. I have played every F1 game, but I only really liked 2013 (the V8s) and 2016. This game is rad -- the best one yet.  Category Rating (of 5) Reasoning   Graphics 4.5/5 Awesome variety of settings, didn't get perfect 5 because some textures are weak on the side of the track. The game is easy to optimize for a specific setup.   Sound 9/10 The car sounds are amazing and so faithful to the real thing. From the turbo whine and wheel spin to crashes, and rain starts, the sounds are AMAZING. Also, the various manufacturers' cars sound different from each other -- especially when braking (McLaren-Honda sounds way different from the Force India, for example -- S/O to  ♥♥♥♥♥ Tassles ).   Music 4/5 Idk, I turned it down, so should you. Engines are more important.   Cinematics 3.5/5 The intro stuff is amazing, but the career cut scenes, while beautiful in the background, leave something to be desired in the face department. For a racing game though? Top notch.   Story 5/5 A little spice and variety with contract changes, engineering stuff, and goals. Not obtrusive, but present and fun.   Content 5/5 Great variety for a racing game. Fun career, fast quick race mode, and simple multiplayer.   Gameplay/Controls 5/5 Simple, refined gameplay and controls. Great on controller, perfect on racing wheel. Easy to learn, difficult to master. They've added manual starts, formation laps, dynamic weather (get good at rain racing), and some other crud. The crashes are improved and more realistic. The AI is weak on the bottom 3 settings, casual on the middle one, and a good challenge on the final 3 -- you'll adapt. The upgrade system is way cool and encourages thoughtful and engaging play through the entire F1 weekend. "

												7/10Even if you don't like open wheel racing, this is the best circuit racing game you can get on Steam.The things that are expected to be good, such as the racing physics, driver AI, and the overall simulation are all top notch. The racing itself may not be completely realistic, but this is a game, so compromises must be made to include things such as the Multi Function Display in order to remove frustration and improve enjoyment.While the game on the track might as well be perfection, the game outside of the racing could use a little work. Many cutscenes are locked at 30FPS, which can be jarring for users using a non standard refresh rate monitor. The Career mode's r&d programme allows you to develop your car at an unrealistically fast rate and car development is carried into the next season. Finally, I am disappointed in the lack of female driver avatars. Since there is no voice acting for the drivers, I don't see why there are no female avatars that would have made the game feel more inclusive.In general, the racing in this game is near perfect, but any other F1 fan can tell you there is more to Formula One and racing than what happens on the tarmac. I hope Codemasters can remove or ameloirate the faults in upcoming patches, which have already significantly improved the game.			"

												As of right now, F1 2016 is a risky investment because the game is still buggy! Bugs that can break the game like it's done with me. When the game does decide to work, it's great!However, I currently cannot continue Career because of a bug that just blanks the screen after trying to load a mid-session save. Up to this point, mid-session saves have been fine but now it just doesn't work and crashes the game.That's my warning to people who're on the fence with this. Despite the postitive reviews, I think the bugs are still a big problem with this game. Wait for more patches, if any.			"

												An unbelievable F1 racing experience. The closest thing to real F1 racing that you'll ever play. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a wheel and enjoy F1 2016 for a long time to come. The career mode is just absolutely amazing. Tweak everything on your car, develop new parts, and be challenged in online mode against others along with rivalries among other drivers in the career itself. This is the real deal.			"

F1 2016 is a much better performance by Codemasters who have put back into the game what was lacking in F1 2015.Pros:- Career Mode is back- Safety Car and Virtual Safety Car- Formation Lap has been added- Full length weekends back including FP1, FP2, FP3- Goals for free practice sessions- If it weren't for new aero regs next year you could skip 2017Cons:- AI like to form a snake- Yearly release			"

												1st of all The game was extremly well optimised here (PRECISE HERE), i have a solid 60FPS with everything between HIGH/ULTRA (x16MSAA), 1080pRIG:i5-4570 @ 3.20GHz8GB of RAMGTX 1060 (8GB)Game install on HDDAbout the game, I expected nothing from so I am pleasantly surprised to see the quality of F1 2016.Driving is pleasant, easy but tricky once some aids disabled :) The career mode was pretty great tbh, i enjoy it so well ! Specialy when you start playing with a low-tiers teams, it's one of the only game i feel proud to finish 15th/22 (MANOR :D).But the Ai can be ""frustrating"" sometimes, she can easly ignore you when she's close to you in a long high speed corner so you gonna be carefull with that.The rules this year are particularly interesting too so that's probably why i enjoy it so much :DSo yep, definitely a worth buy for everybody who enjoy F1 (or any endurance race competition).PS: I'm Glad to see MODS start coming !

												Amazing game. It runs smoothly on my laptop in medium setting when my system is somewhere near the minimum requirement. The game itself is enjoyable. The career mode, for the first time in the F1 games history, makes me want to play it and finish multiple seasons. The handling model is good, every car has a unique caracter. Ai has improved, although still mostly overtakes each other using DRS. While watching replay, the AI battles are actually pretty interesting.Absolutely recommended for any F1 funs. If you are not, it's also a very good racing game and it will make you love this sport.			"

												AI overly aggressive - I have had cars crash into me 5-10 times per race - usually on DRS zone. While i was on a racing line. With good pace. Not blocking.Again, difficulty is total BS. Either 2 seconds too fast or 2 seconds too slow.Career mode gets real old real soon. Either its driving through checkpoints, saving tires (usually you only need to look out for a corner or two where tyres heat up drastically for some reason) or a fast lap. That’s it. None of it is difficult.Forget the immersion. There is none. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen it all. A manager and an engineer. with 1 - 2 sentences each.Unlike in real life, sky commentators are unimaginative and repetitive. I've stopped listening to them after 3-4 races.Still no tutorial on how to set-up the car.Where is ERS?I'm still recommending it. Just because 2015 was total crap. Don’t get fooled.  This is not a good game. For f1 fans only. "

												So, i've been away from PC driving sims for some time.  Largely because i got rid of my wheel, and also because every sim I've tried in recent history has had inferior driving 'feel' to the gran turismo series on the playstation when played with a controller.F1 2016 feels 'right' to drive.  I'm using a 360 controller and feel that i can do with the car what i want, and handling feels like it should, given that i have never driven F1 before, the physics seem feasible.The AI is particularly good, and a vast improvement on anything i've played before.  Out brake a rival into a corner for example, and they will give room and try to cut back, rather than just plow into you or back way off like in other games.  There's actually some semblance of intelligence there, rather than just sitting on line.Recommended.			"

												Very little online activity, and the computer will run you off the track any chance it gets.Very good skill progression, but holy crap. Getting ran off of the track because the CPU decided to plow right through you on a strait kills the experience completely. (especially if you're doing a race of realistic length) This happens at least every other race.			"

												My review of F1 2016I like the game, graphics are very good.Contact system is very annoying sometimes.Ready system is stupid, i think this would be much better:Let the Lobby owner choose when we start. Or an Option when yo uset the lobby up, like race distance etc, you can choose to turn on that  the lobby owner can choose when they will race or turn on that players can press ready.Sorry for my English, i'm 12 years old.- R&D Upgrades a bit more expensive or less R&D points for a purple score.> Purple: 30 R&D points> Green: 10 R&D Points> Red: 3 R&D points- An option to Skip Emma's stories about rivalry etc- A better damage model if FOM allows itThis was my review of F1 2016 PC Version.

												First F1 racing game to surpass Grand Prix 4. Finally, after 14 years.The game feels complete. The cars feel good to drive. Not too easy, but responsive enough to feel the car.Resource points system in career mode is very cool and gives the feeling you can really build and develop a career.The challenges for free practice are a very good and fun way to learn circuits, and as a way to earn resource points for improving the car. They're a great way to both prepare for qualifying and race, and also makes you feel you're really in a career.Codemasters impressed me with this game. Hope they stay on this track.Would recommend anyone doubting and anyone who enjoys racing or F1 games.			"

												I am just starting out on it. I have had bad experiences with F1 2014/15. The return of the Career mode was vital. It saves this game and makes it very much playable. Some typical codemaster settings have not gone away. There is a madeningly inconsistant check of 4 wheels on the track. Screenshots show that you can get a penalty for nothing. The same is true for accidents where you can be driven into, you spin uncontrolably, boiunce back on the track, and ....who knew ....it was your fault. But these things are minor. I love a good moan, but this game so far is much better than the previous ones. I love testing, I love the full race distance, I love the warm up laps, I love the atmosphere. A bit more english humour and a more intelligent race engeneer and this would be perfect for me.Thank you to codemaster for finally listening to the fans. More reality, more fun, more story line...and here we are, raised from the dead! Thank you!			"

												The gameplay is pretty much flawless, you could be absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥at driving (like I am), and still make a valiant effort thanks to the driving assistance, however if you're an experienced driver you can scrap all the outer assistance and make it all about you and the car.The story mode is better than ever before, I'd still wish for more interaction with the press, managers, agents and engineering. The new research points system is very cool and adds another layer to the game. And the cherry on top of the cake, it's ""only"" 40 bucks (at least for me).			"

Posted: August 19, 2016
												TL;DR It's very good. For sure Codemasters best F1 game to date. But has notably problems like fairly passive ai. It's also buggy and Codemasters tend to spend little time fixing bugs. Could be truly great if they put effort into improving it.Having done my first two career races I can happily say it's good. Not perfect, not by a long shot. I'd stop short of the glowing review above, but it's good.Notable down sides, bugs, there's quite a few, including a hilarious one where I'd got distracted by real life so had to restart my first race (I hate restarting). Apparently when I restarted, Haryanto was going through a foam sign at the time, so when we restarted I noticed that the game had decided to remember that. His car had foam constantly bouncing out the back of it. It was amusing if not somewhat distracting.My biggest criticism however is the AI doesn't seem as punchy as it was last year (one of last years highlights). They have gone back to the, oh, I'm on the outside, I will back off now mentality. Also, and this annoys me, they refuse to cut across if another car is on the outside around a corner. So in Bahrain where I had a ridiculously good position on the grid compared to Australia, (either luck, learning how to drive or a balance issue) I saw Hamilton and Rosberg spend about 6-8 corners side by side..... That, kinda, wouldn't happen. So it seems the ai isn't aggressive enough. I haven't seen any ai tangle with each other yet.Also, another thing, the ai is weird on the first lap, they all bunch into a close nit line. Now, I don't know if they use different ai on the first lap, or, there's a weird catch up thing going on, (god I hope not), but it feels very weird. They all seem to go the same speed (or close too) After the first lap it's fine though. Once you hit the first round of pit stops there's cars doing all sorts of things, which makes it feel really alive, if not slightly hard to follow.The strategy, both race and long term development is fantastically done. There tyres really feel like a choice. The pit crews often (too often), gives you alternative strategies to switch to during the race. I say too often, because as I was desperately trying to cling to 11th with 2 laps to go in Bahrain (it didn't work, I feel to 14th), it was just, really distracting. No, I don't want to pit with 2 laps to go. Stop asking. Also, stop telling me you'll let me know if there's a storm front on it's way. In Britain, sure, but I'm racing in Bahrain. It just sounds silly. So, the radio is still a bit annoying, even if it is much better. (The options you have to interact and the information you can get are much better).Obviously the game is build to be used with (if you like) voice commands for the pit wall, however I haven't seen any way to actually make it respond to my headset. It would be disappointing if it wasn't in built in this years version, (last years required an external program).Oh, another thing and this really ♥♥♥♥♥ me, I use a G27. If I hit a button on the keyboard, the little tooltips for what each button does relates to the keyboard, it'll tell me F5 swaps pages in the set up screen or something. But if I hit a button on my wheel, all the tool tips turn to Xbox controls. What button on my wheel is X, I ask you. Unless the game is being played with a controller, it should never come up. Why can't the tool tips just reflect what's in the settings menu? Why not let the player customize the out of race bindings as well?Oh, another thing, the VSC is awesome, but, it needs to show your delta in the middle of the screen and have it larger. (I'm sure mods will make this happen). Because the pint sized text box on the right is damn hard to see when you're trying to keep to is through a series of corners as well as trying not to run into anything or miss a braking point. Also, entering the pits, you have to manually slow the car. I like that. But, it's damn hard to make sure you're going 56 and not 61. (Melbourne was not a good race for me).I really like this years game so far. But good god, a lot isn't bugs. It's just, obvious stuff they they either haven't got around to or are oblivious too. It's painfully obvious that it's a port.Worth noting, it runs very well and it's looks good as you would expect. The sound is good, but the volume of the competitors is too high, so you think there's a car coming up behind you and he's actually five or ten seconds behind. There seems little difference in sound between a car on your gearbox and two corners back.So, that's my thoughts so far. Defiantly their best game. Far from perfect. Driving as K-Mag's team mate in the Renault. 0 points for the team so far. Solid start I think. But I am beating K-Mag.A quick few things that are great, the rivalry system is just, amazing. The race starts are fantastic the physics are really a highlight I think. Sound is solid, the career mode is back and is well done. Although, really it should be standard fair. The last bad thing I'll say is this, unlike most games I buy, I have little hope that Codemaster's will significantly address issues with the game (apart from game breaking bugs). The tight schedule means they don't spend any time really improving the game post release. I hope that mods can fix some issues, but from last year they basically killed off the modding scene as they made it impossible to mod most things.			"

Practice days are much more enjoyable and rewarding then ever before.If you're an F1 fan like myself, get it. I promise you, you will not regret purchasing it			"

												After 23 hrs playing updatedLets start withCons-I use a wheel, haven't tried the keyboard, but the controller is twitchy. If you find it that way, there is a fix for it, you need to edit action_map_preset_win file, xi_preset1 or preset2 steer left & right deadzone 0.0, I also set saturation to 0.0, try out what works for you. I also add 5 to steering linearity-AI bumps into you too much, hopefully patch will fix it. I drive in a straight line, without trying to block AI & they still run into the back of my car.That's about it for the consPros-AI is challenging on MEDIUM+-Graphics are pretty good-Feels amazing with a wheel (without any adjustments), I usually drop down the force feedback since i find it annoying at 100%-Career mode is pretty amazing-Great physics & cars feel smooth-Love the new engineer updates!-Codemaster keeps putting out patches!-Steam workshop makes it easier to pick Car SetupsKeep up the good work Codey, best racing game I have ever played, hands down!

Why do they take 1 step forward 5 steps back every year?! and to think they're asking for £40 for this? haha jokers. No live updates again, yet that was promised from 2014! LOL. Cop & BS.I do like the new career mode they've introduced, it's about the only good thing about the game. Otherwise it's another piece of trash from Codemasters that belongs back up the arses of which it came out of.			"

												As much as I'd like to give this game a positive review, there's a couple things that make parts of this game unplayable. Now I've been looking forward for the ""upgrade to f1 2015"", or you know, a complete version of that game. And this game does do that. By implimenting the career mode (and all of its nice little quirks), the game has some definition other than just time trial and quick race. The offline AI are alright, they let you attack pretty easily as to avoid a collision, but actually defend a little bit. My main problem with the game is the online AI. You might think this is one problem who cares, but to me it's extremely prevelent considering I like to play with my mate, but the online AI have something to say about that... We are playing on legend so if it isn't hard enough to keep up and overtake, the AI will literally break poorly (either into you or early in front of you), and completely ignore your existance if you're not the host. Even if you are th host, it's not as good as single player AI, which once again, are just OK.In closing, this is a great single player racing simulator if you like Formula One, but the online is shotty at best at the moment, and Codemasters are literally on vacation 10 months out of the year, so I won't be expecting much of a patch for these AI anytime soon.

												Overpowered Split stream from the built in AI system carries over to online multi-player making online racing a slipstream fest. Games physics model leave contacts made during close racing and battles pron to accidents,  resulting consequences   are lost/damage front wing or spin. The net-code is better but still needs work as cars will lag and cost you time or damage. The top 10 runners during qualifying gets a tyre wear glitch where they have significantly more tyre wear than the rest of the grid on harder compounds. F1 2016 Will need more fixing and patches as The safety car is back but does not function properly making league races long and boring with no forceful strategy calls. The VSC is also bad, you can accelerate during the VSC period right before green flags gaining an advantage over your rivals. The only thing positive that could be said about F1 2016 is that the handling model is better than F1 2015. 6/10 for me as the game is full of graphical bugs for PC users making driving at times un-raceable as the screen freezes and stutters through out a race. It's sad COdemasters can get a budget build a game on it, make a profit on a release then just leave the current game in it's state. 7 patches does not fix a game which in my opinion was not ready for release.

No way to access menus directly.  you need to enter a race, press B, then escape 2x to get to a game menu.  Awful vague force feedback.  If you play with a controller you will be fine, but for a racing sim player, stay away.			"

												It's a very good game with active developers trying to fix all the bugs that are in the game.although, i have a slight issue with the force feedback and vibration options.if you turn off the vibration option, the force feedback will turn off too and vice versa. Even if you put the slider of the vibration to zero, the slider of the force feedback will go to zero too! its really annoying with my steering wheel(logitech formula force ex) to drive without force feedback or with vibration turned to the max. This is so bad that its probably a dealbreaker for me. Unless codemasters fix this soon, im going to refund it.			"

												Garbage AI doesn't have any player awareness, will drive you off the road, sandwich you in turn 1 or rear end you in the braking zone. Have restarted Melbourne Career race a dozen or so times because the AI kept crashing me in the wall whilst not having made it to the first ♥♥♥♥ing pitstop...Safety car is crap aswell, has no ♥♥♥♥ing logic to it. Someone spins out, no crash, no retirees, but hey, whatever right, 4 ♥♥♥♥ing laps of safety car drivel....Someone does crash out, multiple retirees, well who gives a flying f*ck right? No safety car just proceed with your race....I guess Codemasters isn't really a master of code but rather a bloody rookie at coding....This game had potential, given the career research and development, which isn't that great either, you can do all you want with upgrading that Manor, at the end of the career when all teams have done their R&D it's right back at...well, the back. It's also rather rubbish to spend 2 seasons getting a Manor to the front and then deciding, well, on to the next. There's no sense of investment if you can just hop over to the next for a rinse and repeat since well, it doesn't feel like you've build up your car to the max whilst outperforming the other teams....Driving is good enough for 2016ish but the AI, Safety Car and R&D are just lacking, especially the bloody ♥♥♥♥ing AI that can't do anything but put you in the goddam wall.

												Been playing F1 games since Polyphonys 1997. So far this is the most complete F1 game to date. Almost makes up for the disgusting ♥♥♥♥♥how that was F1 2015. To keep this review basic, if you are an enthusiast of F1 this game is well worth the pickup and you will most appriciate all the new features. For a casual fan looking for a good racer, the game works anywhere from full arcade to what i like to think of 'mild-sim' like ProjectCars or Asseto Corsa where its not on rails but no iracing either. You get out of this game what you put into it.Note: being 6hours in I can already tell some things, especially the career mode gimmicks may wear off quick...Most noticeably your agent 'Emma' and your R&D director 'Chris' who are the same generic people you get in every team who say laregly the same things.7/10. Solid game.			"

												If you are an F1 fan, a driving sim junkie or even a casual racer this maybe worth checking out. The driving mechanics work well and feel responsive. The driving assists and difficulty are fully customizble, so you can set the game up in a way that suits you. An interesting career mode where you get to earn points to reseach car upgrades, there are customizable car setups, practice programes and 21 circuits amongst other things. There is a lot to like here. F1 2016 is a great racing game in all aspects.On top of that the game runs very well, and Ive not come across any bugs or crashes in my time with the game. Highly recommended. This is more fun than I thought it would be. Worth checking out! Codemaster have done a great job with this.The only caution is if you dislike racing around the same ciruit 50+ times, becasue you will be doing that in the full weekend modes. This game require soem patience. It is F1 after all. Also it didnt detect my MS wheel, even though it works in other games and is detected in windows 10.

												Well campaign is back and overall they improved the technologic leap forward that F1 2015 was, and made an actual game around it with massive AI improvements. While it is good enough to have in my steam library, I'm refunding due to two reasons:1. I'm not satisfied with the loss of TrackIR support. It was in the 2010 to 2014 editions so I don't see why it would up the cost of development to keep it in the new engine. This is the sole reason I am not recommending this.2. I have life hitting me in the face and will not be able to play this for a long time. By the time I will get to play and enjoy it, the 2017 title will already be released and well... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯			"

												Codemasters continue their trend of updating the game with more bugs in  than Mercedes has horse power. Disqualified with other people taking your grid spot in multiplayer, crashes to desktop, tyre bugs where other people can start on other tyres and  you cant no matter strategy you choose. The game is good, but the  bugs are becoming a joke with every admission of a patch more bugs are introduced to make the next game look better. Same tactic every year.Uninstalled and never to be downloaded again until they fix these pathetic issues.Oh yeah and does it take a company 7 years to realize that you need a mute in game for idiots playing a symphony of house noises with children crying in the background after the session has already started? Well it does with Codenoobs, codemasters please give up the license and let a more competent company make the game.1/10 because of severe bug issues - not impressed.			"

												Game crashes after first race in career. Have tried the game in all graphical settings, including ultra low and ultra high, and still crashes. It isn't my computer since Witcher 3, Project Cars, and GTA V all run on ultra, it is the game. Shame because I was pumped to play it but this bug is an issue. Was told that the game improved a lot from 2015, shame I can't try.			"

												Codemasters has finally unlocked some features the F1 racing game fans were waiting for since 2010, as the ability to run a full season grid with your friends. There are many other improvements that make it a lot better than 2014 and 2015 versions. If you are a big fan of F1 or Codemasters you must by this game. But in general, I do not recommend you to buy this game. I'm a bit disapointed with some old bugs that are still there. I wish they could run a longer time support to fix these annoying issues, although since the release they fixed countless issues. But every year is the same history within the release of each new game of the franchise - you don't need to go far, look to the other racing titles that still have support and development of enhancements with no extra costs.No support for TrackIR is another negative point for me.If you don't have any F1 Codemaster's game, I recommend you to buy the F1 2013 with the DLC, you won't regret! Or wait for the 2017 version! If you still want to buy this game, please, buy it on sale!			"

												What looks like being the best F1 game so far is spoilt by the fact that it is not playable on a fairly high spec PC that runs other Steam games without any problems whatsoever.  Merely completing a quick 5 lap race at Austria makes the game crash to a blank screen resulting in the need to hard reboot my PC.  I can repeat this consistently.  Despite contacting Codemasters directly and being advised to start the game in safe mode and verify the integrity of the game cache, making sure all drivers are up-to-date, this game will not run properly.  What a huge disappointment.  I'd been looking forward to the release of F1 2016 for months.  How could Codemasters have got this so wrong?  It doesn't fill me with confidence about any future titles.  As a software test analyst by profession, it's clear that this game has not been tested properly before release and are relying on gamers who buy the game to identify the issues but don't even bother to fix the issues that are raised.  The issue I'm having seems to be common among other gamers too!  Poor!!  I'd like my money back please!!			"

												This game is a major disappointment. Lets start with control setup using a keyboard and mouse is a no go for me so i used my own logitec game pad...which i had to maually configure. Thats not a real issue but the problem lies with the games failing to streamline the controls in menus for instance my game pad will not work in any menu yet the keybard controls to select left and right are damn F keys!! who the hell uses these huh!?! When im racing i can pause the game with my assigned start button on my gamepad however i cant unpause unless i use the esc key???? I just started playing and i want to throw it out the window with confusing design choices that had me tearing my hair out simply because the in order to progress i had to go through too many menus menus MENUS!!! Hell after a 2 hours i finally start a race only to sit there revving my engine confused as hell telling me to use the clutch (which up to this point was never explained) also the game expects you to read a damn menu during a race to tell you team what you want and of course i can activate it (with the gamepad)but i cant navigate????!! I have to say that after getting burned by this game and a motogp game i WILL NEVER BUY A RACING SIM AGAIN!!!!			"

												How are people giving this positive feedback? - The AI Is bumper cars 2016 - they cut you off and if they touch you, you spin and you get a penalty no matter whose fault - They sandwich you and they will take you off the road at any time!- Tire glitch where you go to the pits and you get put on inters on dry weather- Multiplayer championship glitch doesn't remember your points if you continue mid-season you start from 0 points- Tyre wear suddenly jumps from 10% to 80% mid-lap!- Tyre wear is inconsistent between each hardness (sometimes softs are the same as supersofts etc)- The engineer must be drunk - You ask ""Gap behind"" he says ""Confirmed""- Under safety car sometimes cars can overtake you and YOU have to give the place back!- Sometimes when it starts raining and you go in inters you are SLOWER than those with dry tyres			"

												If you want to drive a properly simulated F1 car on tracks with no auto spin kerbs, a better setup screen, better AI, and infinitely better handling, go buy Assetto Corsa's Red Pack DLC. If you want to play an officially licensed F1 game with terrible AI, very unrealistic handling (F1 drivers can put the throttle down faster and go on kerbs more than you can here), and a too-simplistic setup screen, then this game is perfect for you. Let's hope codies also gives a better wheel and controller setup screen too, aside from the proper simulation handling and physics which this game should have had.			"

So if someone has their mic on, you have to endure listening to their engine for the whole race.-Handling is awkward and unrealistic-Cars look like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Much better detail on any mod in Assetto Corsa-No way to change tuning set up while in multiplayer mode. Have to set it up elsewhere, save the set-up, and then load it in multiplayer or something. I didn't have the patience to figure it out. -Scroll down to other reviews and you'll find many, many more!			"

												I  have the impression to be a beta-tester with a SLI configuration with 2xGTX970 and W7 Pro 64 bit and triple screen at 5880x1080.Changes on 24 August created some modification to the settings. In addition to the previous very annoying and continuous noise buzz that has not been fixed, I have to check and try several settings to finally found the one that remove some blickering and some sort of darker halo two meters in front of the car.I had to put almost everything maxed out in terms of settings for that (except the two ""off"" recommended by Nvidia for 3D settings: for ""particles"" and “?). Therefore my fps is averaging 30-36 (without 3D surround of course).I have to say that I consider this game unfinished and therefore I stop to be a beta tester and I return to F1 2012 with the wonderful mods created by the community (realism patch, HD texture for the circuits and the cars etc.) where I can enjoy better quality racing from my cockpit and fps around 100.I will come back and maybe modify my rating when a solid patch settles these issues. In addition the absence of support for TrackIr5 and the engine noise that I hate do not contribute to my desire to come back before these points are fixed (for engine noise: a mod from the community).

												After all the hype, more stuff to play with, the interaction of engineers and your agent, i went ahead and purchased the game, I have been a F1 fan since the 70's and never miss a race, so i donned my gloves and helmet and started to play.Well, talk about shampoo rinse and repeat, i didnt have it on the hardest level as i really dont want to throw my controller at my rather large monitor, but to say i was bored to tears by Monaco was an understatement.I won all but 1 race, even stopped upgrading so they opersition can catch me, but then i fell into a deep sleep at the wheel and never played again.The game to me seems very so so, good GFX and music/sounds, but, its the pratice sessions and qually that bore me, after time when you done that your left with the race, many times i just quit because i just couldnt face the race after all that ""junk"" to qually and get points in practice to earn better parts.So all in all, i just found it very repetitive, you know what the engineers going to say, you know what your agents going to say and you know you will end up winning.For me, its just another boring F1 game that still falls short of what it really should be, although they did try hard to get it right, there is some sweet spots but for £40 it was a waste of cash, my opinion you may like it as many do, but its a matter of rinse and repeat, a lot!

Posted: August 21, 2016
												I have three reasons why I would recommend not buying F1 2016.. yet?1) This should obviously be driven with wheels and pedals, and Codemasters haven't made that a comfortable experince. There are huge deadzones on both the brake pedal and the throttle pedal. It's especially bad on the throttle. I've simraced for about 8 years and I've never experienced such massive deadzones. There's an aproximately 30% deadzone on the buttom of the brake, and a 25% deadzone on the buttom AND top of the throttle. I have no issues in any other of the racing games/sims that I usually play. This should be easy for Codemasters to fix but it's appalling that such core settings aren't made properly from the start.2) The shiftlights cannot be moved. The last F1 game I bought and played was 2011. It really borthered me that the shiftlight indicators couldn't be moved. I suspect the reason for that is that they need to port their games to consoles, but that's speculation. I wasn't really surprised to see they're still immovable, it is Codemasters afterall.3) The sound is absolutely messed up. Even using the ""full soundscale"" setting, sound is messed up in a couple of ways. The most obvious is that the other cars are waayyy too loud. Way louder than your own car. Also, there seems to be too few sound channels to handle all the noises when you're running in a large pack of cars, makes the car sound like robots beint brutally mistreated instead of expensive racecars.The game has a lot of potential. I hope codemasters patch the game. The physics are decent, the grapics and framerates are good. I'll change my review once I find the game in an acceptable state.			"

												QUICK UPDATE: I'll re-write my review later tonight but I felt it was necessary to say that the replay issues has been patched yesterday. I've been playing the game quite a while now after being able to fix the controller near-decently so I'll re-write it later.First of all, if you have a Steam Controller and plan to play the game with the gyro wheel: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It doesn't work.Now, I've read reviews of people saying this was not only the best F1 game ever, but the best RACING game of all times. Are you all high?? I'll make a simple list of game-breaking bugs that are in the game right now.- If you have any controller or wheel other than those officially supported, they won't work.- Even if you have a wheel or a controller listed as compatible, like my Steam Controller or a G27, they still might not work properly.- The Steam Controller comes as supported, they even made a very complicated default config with gyro steering controls... TOO BAD IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE ACTUAL GAME! The game considers the Steam Controller as an X360 gamepad so it applies all the dampening and limitations of a thumbstick to your motion steering wheel, making it IMPOSSIBLE to play. If you want to turn, it will go straight. If you want to go straight, it will turn. You wanna go right? he'll go left instead! Garbage. Absolute garbage.- The AI. Don't get me started. You're driving on your line, on a straight, you're not moving around... BOOM. the AI car behind you decided to go full nuts on your backtrain and crashes you out of the game. They don't even try to overtake you on the free side... I've had a car on the Spa straight after the Eau Rouge that tried to overtake me ON THE GRASS. and then crashed on me!- Performance is terrible. I have an R9380 that can run Doom at ultra at 100 fps and I have to run this game at ULTRALOW (!!) and I can't still do more than 50 fps. Then you go into the flashback/replay, and it drops to 1,5fps, you wait 15 seconds, the replay finally shows up but it runs at 9-10 fps.it's a pity. knowing Codemasters they will now release a couple of patches, two months between each patch because console-patching costs money, and then they will go silent for a couple of months until they will announce their new super hyped F1 2017. this game could have been really good. I believed in that. I believed we could finally have the F1 game we've been promised since 2012. But no, another broken game, promised patches that will bring out more bugs and then Codies will go like ""next year it will be better!""if they don't fix this there will be no next year for me. I've already skipped buying the 2014 and the 2015, this one looked promising but I'm out of here seriously if they leave this game like this.			"

												In a word? Whitegoods. F1 2016 is the best Codemasters F1 game by a country mile, but it's still not that enjoyable to play.A racing game is all about driving. F1's problem is that it's driving isn't much fun, the cars feel numb and a bit uninteresting. The handling model does absolutely eveything it should do, it just doesn't do it in a way that's fun or exciting. The whole game just feels a bit meh.If I could give it a ""meh"" I would, it's a solid 6/10. But it's not good enough to warrant a Recommend, so I'll have to downvote it.			"

I loved the Carrer mode and the game really does make you feel like your part of the team in an awesome way. I just didn't feel like I was driving an F1 car which is kind of what the game is about.

												Poor menu layout for beginners, a struggle just to work out how to change to cockpit view. If game companies want to encourage digital only downloads make the effort with tutorials and instructions to not discourage the older generation or newbies to take up the hobby.Not offering a ""genuine low quality"" graphics setting for low range graphics cards (is it really that hard to offer this option.)I mean come on i can play Project Cars or Assetto Corsa with pretty good detail for an old card at medium settings on an overclocked HD5850 at 1600x1050, with frame rates between 65-100 yet on the lowest detail setting for F1 2016 at much lower resolution i struggle to average mid 30's.

												Game causes total system lockup upon entering the track. Every. Single. Time.Every other game on steam (including many race titles) runs without a problem. Changed drivers, changed settings, tried CM Tech support...all failed.  My system fars exceeds the game requirements.  Fortunately Steam now has a refund policy.  Keep that in mind, you may need it!

												I thank you for releasing a new F1 game. It's probably the best since 2013. Congratulations. However, the team that develops F1 could have done a much better job if they corporated with the DR team, and also had took a look at other racing games. It's not easy to be the racing company for years, but Codemasters has to acknowledge they are surpassed by other companies now. The list: - No pit-limiter button- No ingame or outgame eyefinity adjustement (Assetto Corsa ingame or Dirt Rally outgame)- No softlock - No wheel rotation or wheel ratio adjustment (270 - 420)-  No option to disable wheel and arms.  (Can be modded. Racedepartement)-  FFB is dead on straights, etc. (No minimum FFB force, etc) - No advanced FFB settings.- Eyefinity is streched. - Bugs here and there. - No trackir/opentrack support. - No camera-adjustment by buttons. -  See-through mirrors. - Can't allow or disallow racingline and other assists in multiplayer racesettings. - Not able to disable  or skip the cutscenes. - If you have more than one device it will keep asking to insert buttons for the other devices- Can't adjust subtitle-frontsize- AI is awful. Always following the ideal line, rubberbanding, braking too much when SC is out, etc- Crashes are hilarious- No marshalls cleaning debris when someone crashed. - Can cut every corner you don't want to cut in real life. - Flashback is a must when blue flag is out or AI overtakes on long straights. They will crash you. - Debris laying on the ground. - No trackrubbering in this game. - and moreI thank you for reading and I wish the F1 team a bright future. Ivy			"

												They are getting better with this version for sure. I like a lot about it but find that it fails to deliver the smoothness I look for in the graphics, particularly with the anti aliasing effects making everything look a bit jagged in the distance, and for me personally, this is a deal breaker and find that sims such as iRacing have much better AA effects in place. Graphics are not everything of course, and I find the graphics in F1 very decent, although found no way to improve the AA to a satisfactory level even on ultra settings. I wanted to love this game though as they nailed it with all official teams and tracks, which is very cool. No on else out there has the lisence to F1 but codemasters. The career mode seams to be very indepth and well made as well as unique, although the character animations are very cartoon like which puts a damper on giving the game a simulation feel, but the wide array of options settings for the cars and view and such are nice and give a simulation depth. The force feedback seems much better than past versions as do the physics, so well done there.Better AA and better frame rate optimization may have kept this game in my library rather than ending up as a refund. SO close, yet so far away. If the lack of smooth edges in the distance and overall doesn't bother you, or if your system does a better job than mine smoothing them out somehow, this may be right up your alley if you're really into F1. But for me, close but no cigar quite yet.Perhaps next season they'll perfect it and I'll be back with a stellar review...until then....For an in depth unbiased review from inside sim racing, check out my link in the comments section below.For those of you more interested in fanboy comments or perspective written while intoxicated on sublime ganga smoke... check out Tzukasa's replies below.

												I want to like this game but Im struggling.Various FPS issuse reported by some. No SLI which is disapointing on a game like this and the AI needs work.Car handling is a lot harder on a gamepad compared to steering wheel. And do not hope to play with a keyboard, as it will be virtually impossible to pass one of the practice session goals.The game is much better than F1 15 which wasnt hard and in my opinion at least that is the main reason that 90% of reviews are positive. The game certainly isnt 9/10.			"

												HUGE ASTERISK NEXT TO MY NO VOTEThe game in terms of content and mechanics MORE than makes up for the previous 3 installments.The issue I have with this game is the controls. I'm not entirely sure if its me or if the game is glitched, but I've been experiencing numerous instances where controller inputs (be it a G27 or Xbone controller) either hang, are slow to respond, or don't respond at all. This is game breaking as it makes it impossible to mantain smooth inputs and lines while racing around.I feel that, despite the nice amount of content within the game, it was rushed and gameplay bugs were overlooked. A little bit more in terms of developement time would've been nice I think.			"

												Appears to be a decent game. AI is absolutely rubbish - you could drive perfectly for 2 laps then a AI driver hits you from behind, leaving you spinning.Similar things happens at start of race. Can't compete at start of race because the car simply will not go as fast as the AI cars. Basically, you get penalized or run off the track because the AI apepars dumb and basic; no consideration for your position on the track and/or speed. This is considering I have AI set to ""very easy"".Guess I will stick with F1 2012, the one I find the best so far. Hopefully codemaster will improve the AI so not to run user off the track when they are driving in a straight line. "

												I loved the previous f1 games and specially 2014.I played 2015 and did not like it that much i kinda still mis the KERS but its not deal breaking.now in this 2016 i ♥♥♥♥ing hate the game so far, here are my issues with it.- goddamm annoying turbo whistle which you can not disable, best you can do it lower main vehicle sound and max out everything else so it gets muffled with the other stuff going on and even then you still hear it faintly.- controller steering is garbage, when i steer left or right it takes a fraction of a second to respond making it go wobble when you have to avoid impact from a car next to you.- wheel support is eh... but not bad, driving with a wheel is so far the best option because it actually responds right away.- rear view mirror on the top of the screen is gone or atleast i cant find it so this may be my fault.- game HAS to be controlled with keyboard/controller.you can just unplug the mouse because you dont need it anymore for this game.- multiplayer has a mic which is set open by default so expect to hear music or background sounds from atleast 30% of the lobby.so this is quite a big rant so now if you are still reading i will tell you what i like about the game+ driver picking (you can play as whoever you want who is in the current season)+ clutch start (hold clutch, rev up, release clutch)+ better impact of race strategy (you can't expact to win by just driving at full speed 100% of the time in corners #RIPTYRES) + AI don't give no ♥♥♥♥♥ about you, they do not move for you unless you make them physically			"

												The sound is very bad and the steering isnt great. Very little options and none for the much lauded 'sophisticated V6 turbo engines'. No rev counter nevermind an option to increase or decrease in the garage. Absolutly nothing. The Mfd screen in the car looks blank vs the real cars. All in all a massive disappointment, just like real F1 then. That part has been simulated very well.			"

												Surprised to see people are praising the performance of the game. Runs absolutely terrible for me, can't exceed 45fps on medium settings with an RX 480. Waste of time and money once again!Edit: Finally, after nearly a month, this game works properly on AMD hardware.			"

												F1 2016 is a good game. A very good one indeed. I will start with the pros.The performance of the teams mirrors well (not perfect) the performance of the car in real life. The handling is good, i play with a pad and i can take most corners without problems unlike in previous F1 titles, however if i press throttle just a tiny bit it registers as if I floored it. The same applies for the brakes therefore the rear end can be unstable at times.I really like the fact that if even one wheel hits the grass you can lose control of the whole car which in my opinion makes the game feel more realistic.Simulation damage seems OK but i think it can become even more realistic in future titlesFormation Lap is awesome aswell no pit assistance which give you more immersion. The new starting mechanic looks cool and you can jump start if you are not careful enough. Makes the game more immersive.The career is also very good although upgrading can be done very quickly and make a Manor-Marussia a fronttier fighter by the end of season 1. By mid season you can stop r&d development so that you can focus on next seasons car making the game even more realistic.The new stuff you can ask your engineer is also a nice addition although most of it isnt really helpful you know for example who is in front of you.I also like the AI being more agressive (I play on expert) they will also try to divebomb you from time to time which can cause accidents, the same applies for the start i have spun a couple of times when starting in the middle.ConsMany people who drive dirty in MPThe game registers ""Left the track"" too harsh. If i for example go a bit further out of the track in time trial my lap will be invalidated. While is true that i left the track you actually get a penalty in real life F1 if you gained an advantage from it (Corner cut excessive squeezing, overtake etc).Hard to Mod. I miss those classic seasons mods like 1999			"

												F1 2016 plays and feels better... with a gamepad, than any previous Codemasters F1 games, plus career mode is back.Graphics, AI, track/car physics, career, safety car and a lot of content well made.But there are some really annoying cons/bugs.No support for TrackIR 5, playing with close up FOV makes it imposible to look at the apex, left/right and mirrors without TrackIR, unless you use 3 screens or VR ofc.Fanatec's Universal Hub for Xbox One buttons can't all get custom remapped, that some are static set in game makes no sense!  As example, custom binding for Pit Limiter?F1 2016 FFB lacks detail compared to F1 2013/2014 with a CSW v.2On top the game looses FFB and the wheel range when restarting tests etc..Can't recommend the game for anything but gamepad, since they removed features that where in the older F1 games, guess there is to much focus on the console version so some of the sim hardware support is left out for PC.Shame on you Cody for making a good looking F1 game with nice gameplay but forgetting the variety of PC sim hardware.

												One of the most solid F1 games I've played since F1 2013. We now have the safety car back after the F1 2015 fiasco we had. The Career mode is pretty awesome and pretty customizable. Various modes to choose from, load times for Time Trial is very very fast which is a nice touch. The ai are more aggressive than probably any F1 game ever made by Codemasters... the F1 Youtuber community has gave tremendous amounts of help by testing out the game and giving their opinion on various things. Communicating with your crew chief is one of the most easiest things to do without taking hardily anytime asking a question or even telling your chief to 'shut up'' which is hilarious. Online is decent I guess.. hardily any lobbies up but thats not really Codemasters fault. I give it a 8.5/10 to be honest. I havent seen any glitches (YET) and the only problem that I had was a D3D error which multiple people are having.			"

												I've not bought a new F1 game since 2013 and didn't expect to be wowed too much, but the level of detail in this game is amazing. The cars handle properly and it punishes you quite heavily for just holding down the throttle on full and expecting to go in a straight line, career mode is immersive and there's plenty to do in practice making it worthwhile to not skip. Difficulty levels are plentiful and highly adjustable. There's very little that can't be tweaked and changed. Easily the best racing game I've played.			"

												Finally, F1 is back on track. Codemasters seem to be heading in the right direction with Dirt rally and now this. A proper career mode, formation lap and what appear to be very realistic (hard) handling. My main cons are:Still dodgy pit box entry/exit - still judders and the car moves in impossible waysStupid aggression from the AI at times - I've been hit and spun from the rear by AI dodgy driving. I thoroughly recommend keeping flashback on just in case. Some scenes such as in front of your laptop have really bad FPS (in race I get 70fps minimum)Otherwise a really good game. Playing with i5 4670k, 16gb RAM, GTX 970 - 2560x1440, maxed out with benchmark reporting a minimum FPS of 70 (Using latest 372.70 driver)			"

												Ok, to to kick this off, I love the improventements and re-additions to this game. The formation lap, the Safety Car, the various challeges during Practice, to gain upgrades! Awesome stuff!I can't comment on how this game plays with a wheel (don't own one), I prefer a more casual syle - controller with manual gears and tweaked assists & difficulty (Strict track rules, Legend A.I etc)So I'll jump into what I think needs improving (for 'immersion'). The HUB and your race engineer. I feel that to authentisentize (that's a word right?) better to the real life Formula 1, I think each team should have a HUB and an engineer that refects those teams accurately! I.E, a Ferrari engineer who speaks with an Italian accent, a HAAS engineer who is American etc! The graphics are the best I've seen. I'm ultra settings with a GTX 970 Strix, i5 4460, 16GB RAM. 60 FPS at least for me. AA etc maxxed also So game-engine performance is brilliant.So who should buy this. Well I'm sure die-hard F! fans pre-ordered, I did (tho I don't usually pre-order). If your a more casual gamer, read more reviews, buy this game from a key re-seller, if you wish, or buy it on Steam. There's a lot to offer from this lastest itteration.			"

												Brilliant. The racing dynamics are so damn good, totally unforgiving so you feel vindicated when you get that corner spot on, gradually lay down the power to keep the rear end in order and hammer it out down the straight. Hooking a perfect lap together is so satisfying, only to be told you're 574th fastest which of course pushes you on to do better, to dominate all opposing you. Your rival is dust in your mirrors, you're about to crush him when you get off line, marbles coat your tyres and you wildly understeer into the final corner, pushing you onto the grass, killing your tyre temps and ruining your lap. You almost see the glee in the eyes of your rival as he shoots past. Cross the line and start again. Victory awaits.			"

												It's a game for everyone, that's what I can say. You can set it to easy/medium, disable damage, get grippy stability control and you'll get an arcade for the casual fan. Crank up the difficulty, disable aids, get a good USB steering wheel (I'm using a Logitech DFGT) and you'll get a hard, challenging sim for the true simracer. Although there are more realistic representations of racing cars, I did not buy this expecting iRacing level of quality and physics. Yet this game can be tough. And the AI has improved vastly over the abysmal... thing that was last year's game. They put up a fight against you and between itself. You can get caught up in the middle of a fight, join in, and take advantage of it, just like the real thing. And career mode... holy moly that is awesome.Still haven't tried multiplayer but I hope they take the example of multiple online racers and prevent blatant cheating, or at least avoid being a hackfest like GTA V.Score: 9.8/10			"

												If Codemasters thought the last 5 iterations of the F1 franchise were a step forward, then this latest one is a rocket to the moon forward. All I can say is that this is the game fans have been waiting on for years. If you are skeptical, I can't blame you, but this is an absolutely outstanding game that brings in features that the community have been asking for. Formations laps, manual starts, pit entries, radio messages to your engineer, it's just crammed full of immersive features that are necessary in an F1 simulator. Unlike previous titles, the track evolution, tyre wear, temps etc are all noticable on performance and managable in a realistic manner. Aside from the occasional crashes which have been and are being patched out (I have already seen a noticible difference since 1.3), there really is nothing I can fault in this game. Finally this franchise is heading in the right direction. Now we just need to hope Codemasters continue this progression and add even more immersive features i.e manually pulling in to your team's garage and pit form the pitlane and driving to your grid position. F1 is no longer just the pinnacle of motorsport but the pinnacle of motorsport games.			"

												Really well done F1 racing game. The past years I kept playing F1 2013 because the more recent F1 games were fairly bad, but then F1 2016 arrived. The mechanics of tyre strategies, regulating fuel usage, and in-race strategy changes (suggested by your pitcrew) really make for an engaging race experience. Lots of little details also add to the experience, like giving real voice commands to your pitcrew. The SP career is great, with improved training sessions and the addition of warm-up laps, manual pit entry speed and a real safety car. Online I've had the most fun; racing through a whole season together with a friend, in the same team. TL;DR : 9/10			"

It felt more and more like they weren't even trying. Due to this I doubted about buying F1 2016, but I'm very glad I did!The cars feel natural and smooth, but the main difference is everything around it. The implementation of tyre strategies is done perfectly, and so are the new challenges during all sessions. This makes the practice sessions as essential as they are in real life.Without a doubt, this game is worth the buy.			"

												Everything about F1 2016 is a vast improvement over last years release. I'm yet to experience a single crash! Career mode is back (rightly so), a great added emphasis on practice sessions to acquire R&D points (though I find the tyre management session is difficult with a pad), safety car is back plus VSC is added. Sure the AI can be a bit overzealous at times, and they do need to sort out the odd radio messages from your race engineer prompting you to switch strategy and pit with only a couple of laps remaining.Overall, recommended for F1 and racing fans alike.

No problems with gameplay, or bugs so far.Pros:* Actually playable very very playable(compared with 2015)* Good handling very good handling i play with pad xbox 360+xbox one pad(maybe little but little improvement wants to but ok)* Good graphics* Formation lap gives you a sense of pressure to get your start right!* Manual Starts are a great addition* R&D gives a sense that it is up to you to develop the car right. (Career)* Different cars give you different feels. * Way more options to tune you car for the race e.g ride height is back!* Can choose the total tyres to have for the weekend. (Career)* Doing teams goals in practice are like mini games, they reward you with R&D points so you actually can imporve your car. And in doing so, you also improve your driving skills.* So good game optimization(70+fps all ultra settings at 1920*1080)Cons:- Safety car is to fast(but its fixible in future with patch)- AI can be improved little(but its good for me)- And for now i dont see the sparks(but i know will put to the next patch because this problem It is for all consoles so far).Most of the Cons can be fixed in a future patch, so they are not that big deals.I play with everything on ultra settings, I easily get around 70+fps.So good game optimization.I am running a:i5 4690kgtx 106016gb ram240gb ssd1920*1080p monitorGood work Codemasters on this front.

												F1 2016 is without doubt the best F1 game released by Codemasters in the series so far – it’s obvious they’ve really made the effort to implement what fans have been asking for since F1 2010 – and it’s resulted in a massively immersive F1 experience.The cars and tracks look amazing, racing is exciting and just so much fun, but it’s the career mode for F1 2016 which really shines, especially the new R&D upgrading system in career mode which makes you feel that you are really contributing to the team’s development and rewards you for putting in the extra effort in the Practice sessions.  Also a more “real” feature is your ability to plan your tire selection before the race, and then make later changes during the race if the situation calls for it – just adds to the realism of F1 experience.The formation lap, manual starts and manual pit entry are the icing on the cake – my only wish is that you could manually drive all the way to your grid position and pit stop – perhaps something to look forward to in 2017 (or a 2016 patch?  ). Whilst it’s pretty easy to drive with a controller, I’m now looking to buy a proper wheel and pedal setup to do this game justice.  So far, can’t fault it – job well done Codemasters! 9/10			"

There is no SLI Support and running at 4k my 980's dont seem to be optimized for this game. Hopefully new drivers and optimaztion will start flowing very soon.			"

												I haven't found anything wrong with this game to not recommend it.  It's the cleanest driving experience I've had since racing games back in the early 00s where they were simply clean because detail couldn't be put in them.  Driving is great, the rules are great, the AI is so-so, the career mode is great, safety car is back, etc. I recommend getting it if you like these teams and the tracks of the 2016 season since this is CM's best F1 game I've played (I started getting them in 2010). The only gripe is there's a lack of sheer filth you get in racing which makes tracks look kinda artificial. I know with games the way they are made today, objects can be made to look beat.  "

												A much improved effort from Codemasters, and perhaps the best Formula 1 game I have played in years. Manual stars and manual pit stops add to a more immersive experience, along with the safety car and the virtual safety car. Overall, the game just feels like more of a simulation than it has in previous iterations.I am quite enjoying career mode, along with the implementation of communicating to the race engineer during a race. Although this can be distracting at times, this can be turn off by telling your race engineer to shut up.There is some slight stuttering of frames, as well as sound, but I would hope this is addressed in time.A few hours in, I do not regret the purchase and I can safely say Codemasters have listened to the community. You really feel like you're in the moment.			"

												A fantastic edition this year. Really happy to both read and be able to write my own positive review about an F1 Game from Codemasters.F1 2016 is a major improvment over earlier installments and has the best Career mode I have seen to date. Finally, with the inclusion of useful, well done evaluation tests is there reason to do Practice sessions.Pros:- Visuals- Car Physics- AI Randomness (no longer appear like they're on rails)- Realism that matches the current IRL F1 Season- Upgrades- Long and inclusive Career Mode- Competitive, quick, and exciting races- Strategies play a huge part for tyre management (when on 25% distance at least)- Smooth, high FPS all round (besides that motorhome ;))Cons:- Minor graphical issue in garage (notice on Ultra High the rear wheels don't have blankets, but the engineers still remove something invisible)- Motorhome FPS is very low. Not game breaking but a tad annoying- Still get the impression Expert is too low and Legend a little too high on certain tracksCons are minor, Pros are huge... easily recommended. Well done, Coddies :)			"

												First time playing, played it 10 hours straight. What an amazing fun game.The AI is much better and more challenging, I had to lower the difficulty compared to previous games.The game looks gorgeous, even on ultra low (I have a low-end computer unfortunately). Overall runs really smooth, the benchmark allows you to test these settings properly.There are some bugs: one race I couldn't ask things over the radio, and almost during every race the interval timers are off. This mostly occurs at overtakes, where the system just glitches out or something. At the next measurement the interval is correct again, not a big problem but a bit annoying.Overall, very pleased so far, really enjoying it. I most definitely don't regret pre-ordering it :)			"

												As a pessimist to Codemasters ability to make an F1 game, refusing to pre-order and waiting for reviews and day one footage, they proved my intial thoughts wrong. Fantastic game, tough but fun once you've found your sweet spot with your wheel, assists and ai (being Medium Traction and Expert AI for now), and a very in depth career mode (loving the R&D elements).The physics for the car are tough, never would have thought I would need to turn on Medium Traction, and even the 4th strongest AI setting out of 6 is pretty tough for me, as someone who used to play the first F1 games made by Codemasters. No need for ai difficulty mods at the moment, that's for sure.Only come across one bug so far, that being in the replay menu where it may freeze the video of the game when you change camera, forcing you to return to garage. Sounds could also be patched/edited, but nothing at all major and all easily patchable, which is great for a market renowned for poor day one releases, particulary on PC.Would certianly recommend to all F1 fanatics, arcade racers or sim racers.

It is very immersive.My only criticisms are that in the career mode I think it would have been better to have driver transfers during seasons and different lineups at the start of each year like in real life. The graphics have only slightly improved from F1 2015.Buy it!!			"

They took what was good from F1 2015 (graphics, handling, AI) and they improved it with the safety car, virtual safety car, manual starts, new career mode with car R&D, practice programs, formation lap. F1 fans will sure love this game and of course not only them. I also liked the voice commands to the engineer and the suggetions for altering the race strategy during the race.			"

												A lot has already been said about this game. There's lots to like: the good enough physics that lean toward sim-level quality (not quite but not too far from either), the atmosphere, career, the details, the convincing enough tracks...And there's a few things that could have been better: the graphics are not as good as advertised, even when maxed out. Performance issues and a slight input lag with wheels are not yet solved. And the AI. Overly and recklessly aggressive at times, causing accidents and ramming the player from behind, especially as from Expert and Legendary difficulties, while it also acts too shyly when fighting you over a corner in wheel-to-wheel action, not to mention the long AI trains on straights...All in all, a very good game that should even please a hardcore sim-racer or two.  8/10			"

I'm running 3 monitors with nvidea multi screen and sli and the game copes great.

												I have only sampled this game but, it seems to be more challenging, better looking and overall a good edition to the serious.I'm not happy with performance yet. There is no SLI Support and running at 4k my 980's dont seem to be optimized for this game. Hopefully new drivers and optimaztion will start flowing very soon.			"

												Game works perfectly. Runs smooth, looks great. Sound is so-so. Gameplay is awesome. First race in a Sauber (15 laps Melbourne) and my engineer started giving me fuel warnings with about 6 laps to go. I ignored and kept pushing to get ahead of my team mate. I ran out of fuel with 1/4 lap to go.			"

												After F1 2015, which is an unfinished, awful product, I lost all my faith in Codemasters. However, this latest installment is turned out to be quite good. I really like it so far. It runs well, looks fine, supports both my controller and wheel. I think, they sacrificed the previous version by introducing a new engine, just to create a proper release this time.			"

												10/10.Quality game.Have bought all the codemasters Formula 1 games since F1 2010 and 2016 is by far the best.Highly recommend this game to anybody who likes any motorsports.Great fun so far.Pros: Graphics wise there is no comparison between the 2015 and 2016 the game is just     immaculate.          Gameplay wise it brings me back to the 2010 game but the features being more in depth. The new features like being able to actually speak to your race engineer is a real bonus because you don't have to go back to the pits every time to check your pace or the forecast. The R&D section in the career laptop has to be one of the brightest ideas codemasters have ever had in their Formula 1 games so full marks for that.Cons: The audio in the game can sometimes be quite trippy depending on how many cars are around you, the game is trying to load the sounds of other cars at a distance while also trying to load the cars nearest to you. Sounds like a good idea but it makes it sound like your speakers are on the verge of breaking.           The A.I are incredibly stupid, they seem not to have any spacial awarness what so ever and at any moment would decide to hit you ( especially when using DRS for some reason ). They also seem to try and make the most ridiculous passing manouvers out there constantly failing and nearly driving off the track.          Last but not least the flashbacks. The flashbacks are perfect bar one thing. Whenever you restart after using the flashbacks the game doesn't automatically move to the direction of which you are pointing, there is a delay after you pressing X on the controller ( Which I personally find most annoying due to the track limit penalties ). I'm not sure whether this problem occurs on racing wheel controller but for Xbox and PS3 controllers it sucks when you need to flashback.All in all very minor issues for the most part but I will stick to my 10/10 due to it's lack of time released.

												YES it is a Codemasters Formula One Game.YES they messed up F1 2015 last year.But this game is amazing. I am a pretty big Sim racer, and I race karts competitively in real life, and I can say that the racing expereince is the best that I've seen in an F1 game to date. The features included, the career mode, the way the car handles and the way the tracks feel along the kerbing and fast corners are awesome. The graphics are really good too, and even the minor details of tire rubber splashing onto the TV Pod as you go around the exit kerbing at Circuit Gilles is remarkable. I highly reccomend this game, and this isn't something I say easily about racing sims. If you are a fan of Formula One, this is the game for you.			"

												The driving is excellent, career mode is awesome, and they even added R&D tasks to practice sessions.  You can drive all 3 practice sessions with an objective besides just practicing, which earns you research points to upgrade your car- love it!Sadly Codemasters contune to hate PC gamers with no mouse support for the menu.  The game is supurb but the menus are a pain to navigate with the keyboard or your wheel.  They do work well with a controller as that was what it was designed for.			"

												As a pessimist to Codemasters ability to make an F1 game, refusing to pre-order and waiting for reviews and day one footage, they proved my intial thoughts wrong. Fantastic game, tough but fun once you've found your sweet spot with your wheel, assists and ai (being Medium Traction and Expert AI for now), and a very in depth career mode (loving the R&D elements).The physics for the car are tough, never would have thought I would need to turn on Medium Traction, and even the 4th strongest AI setting out of 6 is pretty tough for me, as someone who used to play the first F1 games made by Codemasters. No need for ai difficulty mods at the moment, that's for sure.Only come across one bug so far, that being in the replay menu where it may freeze the video of the game when you change camera, forcing you to return to garage. Sounds could also be patched/edited, but nothing at all major and all easily patchable, which is great for a market renowned for poor day one releases, particulary on PC.Would certianly recommend to all F1 fanatics, arcade racers or sim racers.

												I've played every single version of F1 from the good (F1 2011) to the really really bad (F1 2015) and this is the best of the series.  This is the first F1 game that I didn't have to tweak wheel settings for hours before playing.  I set my force feedback up and went.  2016 seems a lot less taxing graphically on my system than 2015 did.  The controls are more responsive, the AI is much much much improved, and hey, look at that, career mode is back.  It's almost as if the Dirt Rally team snuck in daily during the F1 team's lunch break and worked on the game.  I'm very impressed thus far with the game.			"

												FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH STEERING WHEELS, CODEMASTERS IS AWARE. IN THE MEANTIME, FOR QUICKFIXES FIXES VISIT CODEMASTERS FORUM OR R/F1GAME ON REDDIT.F1 2016 is a significant improvement over F1 2015; not only in gameplay, but in performace and optimization as well. I will give a quick run down of things I like, and I will update it as I clock more hours in the game.Pros:-Career Mode (So far it started out good, so I'll see what else takes place during it)-Car Development (Puts you against other teams, and allows you to pick the path of the car development)-Pracice Session (FP Sessions now have a purpose, been doing all the test runs.)-Graphics (Look really nice.)-Car Physics (The car handling feels better than 2015, and the extra telementry displayed is a great for referencing how much you should/shouldn't push the car.)-XBOX ONE CONTROLLER IS WORKING FINE NOW!!! Cons:-FPS drop while sitting at the team's lounge (Will most like get fixed soon.)Overall:A really well put together game, certainly makes up for the letdown that F1 2015 was. Worth buying in my opinion if you are an F1 fan. I will add more to the review as time goes.			"

												Essentially Codemasters have dragged F1 2015 back to the garage and rebuilt it. That's not an insult because they have done a fantastic job. It would be fair to label F1 2016 an iteration but whereas F1 2015 lacked substance and shipped in a woeful state, 2016 is packed and runs great, controls work out of the box and they have tuned up the interface removing lots of small frustrations. Codemasters have clearly changed course and put QC at the top of the list.Graphics are a minor improvement on 2015. On first impressions it looks similiar to 2015 but looking closer you see the details and FX have been bumped up. I've read some previews where they are unimpressed with the graphics but in my mind at least, it looks damned good. I'm running at full detail at 2560x1440 on a 980ti and get a very smooth 60fps. Highly recommended.			"

												(First Impressions)Formula 2016 has from my first impression reigned FAR superior than any previous renditions of the official F1 series. The AI seem intelligent, balanced and fair. The driving itself is really entertaining, and somehow they even managed to make tire-wear a FUN challenge.You have tons of customization, R&D and statistics available. Unlike I expected however, it does not at all come off as too complicated or nonsensical. If you're an average f1 fan, you'll have no issue picking up the system, and there's room to expand and tinker if you're an expert.The new race start system is so addicting I found myself doing the Melbourne start 50 times over and over, just to give myself the edge...All in all, a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic racing game!Post ""First Impression"" review might follow.

												Codemasters have stepped up their game since the F1 2015 fiasco, the game now has a new redesigned career mode which feels way more immersive because of the R&D development aswell as driver faces/numbers etc. The only problems I have encountered is that the loading screen bugs out so I can't change race settings, which is a problem since I would like to drive 25% races instead of 50% races, hopefully this bug can be fixed for those who are experiencing it.

												10/10The game is perfect. No problems with gameplay, or bugs so far.Pros:* Actually playable very very playable(compared with 2015)* Good handling very good handling i play with pad xbox 360+xbox one pad(maybe little but little improvement wants to but ok)* Good graphics* Formation lap gives you a sense of pressure to get your start right!* Manual Starts are a great addition* R&D gives a sense that it is up to you to develop the car right. (Career)* Different cars give you different feels. * Way more options to tune you car for the race e.g ride height is back!* Can choose the total tyres to have for the weekend. (Career)* Doing teams goals in practice are like mini games, they reward you with R&D points so you actually can imporve your car. And in doing so, you also improve your driving skills.* So good game optimization(70+fps all ultra settings at 1920*1080)Cons:- Safety car is to fast(but its fixible in future with patch)- AI can be improved little(but its good for me)- And for now i dont see the sparks(but i know will put to the next patch because this problem It is for all consoles so far).Most of the Cons can be fixed in a future patch, so they are not that big deals.I play with everything on ultra settings, I easily get around 70+fps.So good game optimization.I am running a:i5 4690kgtx 106016gb ram240gb ssd1920*1080p monitorGood work Codemasters on this front.

												This is the first F1 game I've purchased since F12013. I have to say that Codemasters did a fantastic job with F12016 and I would even go as far as saying this is the best none sim-racing game that depics it's perspective sport very well.I've only put in roughly 10 hours or so in career mode doing full weekends at 50% race distance. Third race in and I'm finding this game very immersive. The practice sessions have a purpose in helping with improving car development for as long as your on the team. AI are the best I've seen in a racing game at this point as well. They are still not purfect but the AI are not affraid to challenge without doing too many stupid stuff. The car handling is a challenge at first in getting a feel for it but all in all a solid job of balancing sim/arcade feel to it. The cornering grip with the different compound tires are done very well as well and feels realistic.Long story short... Codemasters did a fantastic job here and this game was well worth the $50 I spent. I rarely feel I get my money's worth these days in games, but this one is well worth it. I would recommend this purchase to anyone who enjoys circuit racing.			"

												highly recommend this game ! I own 2010,2011,2012,2014 and now 2016. 2016 Is ,by far the best! Highly customisable wheel and petal settings( I have Act labs petal set and logitech wheel) had no problems setting up either. the new career mode is very indepth. the addition of 22 player multiplayer support is awesome! i am running a nvidia gtx 960 and the graphics are awesome (im averaging 86fps 1920x1080) .I decided to skip the 2015 version because of all the bad reviews (and i loved 2012 and 2014) so i was a little skeptical on buying 2016, but 2016 is by far the best of them all, you wont be dissapointed!

												F1 2016 is a solid racing game that copletly out does the previous year, as there is so many new features to keep you ocupped in the game for exampke the new career mode is fantastic , but therer is also a few draw backs.-Perfomance could be better, optimization is needed-a few bugs that need to be ironed out with the formatiojn lap, In china my the sauber infront of me just stopped for no reason adn the game went into replay mode- you dont get much time with preparing for the start if you are one of the back markers, you get a second a most before you holding revs i believe this time should be increased.but the positives is a list that is too long to type.-Great grapchics-sounds are nearly perfect this year.-Execllent R&D system, it actualy makes sense to use the practise time that you have.-accurate race positioning with a good few surpires epecially in qualifing.-working multiplayer.

												After having played every single F1 game except last years I was hoping for some larger changes to the game itself as it had started to become really stale and this year's version of F1 has delivered on improving upon that. F1 2016 is returning to the game I hoped F1 would become over time and it's virtually every thing I wanted, but falls a little short in a few areas.One of the things I wished would change is the career. It had become stale, generic...no podium. It didn't feel engaging. This year improves upon that. It's nice to see your driver have a face and there is a nice clip of a podium etc if you get in the top 3. You soon get sick of these clips though and the novelty wears off.It's kind of the same thing with your R&D rep, who every single time after you complete an upgrade has to come tell you that you have an upgrade. Again, it gets grating. They could of gave him some different animations or different lines and instead he just ends up getting on your♥♥♥♥♥♥ I can also say that about your agent, (I quite like the rival system btw). Who drops a rival on you every now and then, her dialogue becomes boring and old. Starts to rub on you.This stuff is there to try and engage you more and for the first few races it does. After that, it doesn't count for much. So I wish that side of things, was more engaging and kept you engaged. I like the direction its going, just not quite there.The driving, is superb. Now I'm using a controller. I know there have been some complaints about using one. I havent run into any issues at all. It's been great to control, feels good and not too twitchy. Haven't tweaked any settings it just ran fine. All tracks are really well recreated and another improvement from previous games is that you can use some of the kerbs instead of them feeling like they are made of ice.Tyre wear feels better than previous versions. They seem to have nailed the feeling of losing grip and responsiveness of your tyres and when they start to go, you're losing time. The A.I feels competitive too, after patches they have got even better arguably. They fight for positions and if the difficulty meter works well for your own ability, then it makes for some great races. I know that some people have mentioned that the levels up are too tough, to be honest, I'm racing on a level that is perfect for me. Haven't really had this issue. The added safety car adds more depth as well as the mostly pointless formation lap. It's good that it's there though.Performance of the game is a little hit and miss. Patches for me have made the game perform slightly worse in certain areas and better in others. I am using an i5 4690 and GTX 1070 everything is on max and it runs between 60- 80 FPS occasionally CPU usage will spike for no real reason in some inexplicable areas. Like in the pits OR when I am waiting to access the laptop. Just random CPU spikes. Even with Vsync. So it could do with some work optimisation wise I think.On the whole though, I've really enjoyed the time I've spent in single player with this game and I'm certain I'll be spending a lot more. It looks good, plays quite smoothly, drives well, AI is good and theres not a silly amount of bugs.  "

												FOR ANYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH STEERING WHEELS, CODEMASTERS IS AWARE. IN THE MEANTIME, FOR QUICKFIXES FIXES VISIT CODEMASTERS FORUM OR R/F1GAME ON REDDIT.F1 2016 is a significant improvement over F1 2015; not only in gameplay, but in performace and optimization as well. I will give a quick run down of things I like, and I will update it as I clock more hours in the game.Pros:-Career Mode (So far it started out good, so I'll see what else takes place during it)-Car Development (Puts you against other teams, and allows you to pick the path of the car development)-Pracice Session (FP Sessions now have a purpose, been doing all the test runs.)-Graphics (Look really nice.)-Car Physics (The car handling feels better than 2015, and the extra telementry displayed is a great for referencing how much you should/shouldn't push the car.)-XBOX ONE CONTROLLER IS WORKING FINE NOW!!! Cons:-FPS drop while sitting at the team's lounge (Will most like get fixed soon.)Overall:A really well put together game, certainly makes up for the letdown that F1 2015 was. Worth buying in my opinion if you are an F1 fan. I will add more to the review as time goes.			"

												Essentially Codemasters have dragged F1 2015 back to the garage and rebuilt it. That's not an insult because they have done a fantastic job. It would be fair to label F1 2016 an iteration but whereas F1 2015 lacked substance and shipped in a woeful state, 2016 is packed and runs great, controls work out of the box and they have tuned up the interface removing lots of small frustrations. Codemasters have clearly changed course and put QC at the top of the list.Graphics are a minor improvement on 2015. On first impressions it looks similiar to 2015 but looking closer you see the details and FX have been bumped up. I've read some previews where they are unimpressed with the graphics but in my mind at least, it looks damned good. I'm running at full detail at 2560x1440 on a 980ti and get a very smooth 60fps. Highly recommended.			"

												(First Impressions)Formula 2016 has from my first impression reigned FAR superior than any previous renditions of the official F1 series. The AI seem intelligent, balanced and fair. The driving itself is really entertaining, and somehow they even managed to make tire-wear a FUN challenge.You have tons of customization, R&D and statistics available. Unlike I expected however, it does not at all come off as too complicated or nonsensical. If you're an average f1 fan, you'll have no issue picking up the system, and there's room to expand and tinker if you're an expert.The new race start system is so addicting I found myself doing the Melbourne start 50 times over and over, just to give myself the edge...All in all, a ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic racing game!Post ""First Impression"" review might follow.

												I'm coming back from F1 2012 and I'm glad all the reviews I read seem accurate. I love the ""nerdy"" parts of the sport. The upgrades, the safety car, the practice weekends, setting strategy, the career progression so far It seems awesome. That said however this game runs like hot garbage on my 980Ti. On Ultra High its unplayable, dipping below 20fps even in areas where it shouldn't like in the lounge and opening the laptop, on High its ok generally being in the 30-40 fps. So far the medium presets with some tweaks seems to be where i get the best FPS vs Visual tradeoff. Hopefully some updates will fix some of the performance issues because the game seems great.			"

												Codemasters have stepped up their game since the F1 2015 fiasco, the game now has a new redesigned career mode which feels way more immersive because of the R&D development aswell as driver faces/numbers etc. The only problems I have encountered is that the loading screen bugs out so I can't change race settings, which is a problem since I would like to drive 25% races instead of 50% races, hopefully this bug can be fixed for those who are experiencing it.

Graphics are pretty much those of 2015 though overall performance feels smoother.If there's one thing it's missing it'd be a lenient penalties option.

												F1 2016 is without doubt the best F1 game released by Codemasters in the series so far – it’s obvious they’ve really made the effort to implement what fans have been asking for since F1 2010 – and it’s resulted in a massively immersive F1 experience.The cars and tracks look amazing, racing is exciting and just so much fun, but it’s the career mode for F1 2016 which really shines, especially the new R&D upgrading system in career mode which makes you feel that you are really contributing to the team’s development and rewards you for putting in the extra effort in the Practice sessions.  Also a more “real” feature is your ability to plan your tire selection before the race, and then make later changes during the race if the situation calls for it – just adds to the realism of F1 experience.The formation lap, manual starts and manual pit entry are the icing on the cake – my only wish is that you could manually drive all the way to your grid position and pit stop – perhaps something to look forward to in 2017 (or a 2016 patch?  ). Whilst it’s pretty easy to drive with a controller, I’m now looking to buy a proper wheel and pedal setup to do this game justice.  So far, can’t fault it – job well done Codemasters! 9/10			"

												Best Codemasters F1 game so far I'd say. Pros:- Handling- Extremely addictive career mode- AI are, from my own experience, the best it's ever been, however...Cons:- ...they pull a Maldonado more than often. Let's take Melbourne, my first career mode race, I'm in a Manor vs Legend AI. Both Renaults had gone a lap down to me due to safety cars and they kept trying to unlap themselves in impossible places, around the outside of the fast chicane for example. And whenever they did manage to pass me, they get blue flags again and slow way down - whilst staying on the racing line ofc. Then there's Canada where Räikkönen sent me across the Atlantic after attempting an overtake on the backstraight. I stay on the racing line, he bails, attempts to pull behind me again and clips my right rear. (I did take Verstappen with me in the crash so maybe it was planned...)- MP, not the game's fault though...- No SLI support			"

												A lot has already been said about this game. There's lots to like: the good enough physics that lean toward sim-level quality (not quite but not too far from either), the atmosphere, career, the details, the convincing enough tracks...And there's a few things that could have been better: the graphics are not as good as advertised, even when maxed out. Performance issues and a slight input lag with wheels are not yet solved. And the AI. Overly and recklessly aggressive at times, causing accidents and ramming the player from behind, especially as from Expert and Legendary difficulties, while it also acts too shyly when fighting you over a corner in wheel-to-wheel action, not to mention the long AI trains on straights...All in all, a very good game that should even please a hardcore sim-racer or two.  8/10			"

They took what was good from F1 2015 (graphics, handling, AI) and they improved it with the safety car, virtual safety car, manual starts, new career mode with car R&D, practice programs, formation lap. F1 fans will sure love this game and of course not only them. I also liked the voice commands to the engineer and the suggetions for altering the race strategy during the race.			"

												Massive improvements from F1 2015. The realism is stepped up a huge amaount, with high settings the game looks gorgeous and the career mode not only exists (huge improvement over 2015) but it's the best they've ever made. Features such as car development really add to the experience.			"

												At last a F1 game worth playing, Codemasters have been listening and have put many things    right this time, as well as bringing back the safty car!1) Graffics slight improvement in my eyes over 2015, it just seems to flow much better, you really feel part of the car 8/102)  Sound  its improved, engine noise goes quiet on a few occasion i dont know if this is a bug or what , especially when you go past the pits when other cars are pitting, codemaster will fix iam sure if this is a bug. 7/103)Gameplay real improvement , force feedback better really feel what the car is doing, using fantec csr wheel, however ai can be a bit frustrating sometimes as they seem to just take you out. 7/10 hopfully the ai can be improved a lttle.I personnally like the menu system, i know some dont but i find it perfect for my needs, even thogh ive only spent a few hours in the game i am finding new things all the time. well done codemaster your back on track in my veiw.I must say i am really enjoying this game, yes really its such a improvemnt nice touches, the carrer mode really shines here, really pleased i took the gamble with this one, its a must for any racing fan, races are much more exciting than the real thing!i give this game a 8/10 with just a few little improvements it could be a 9After patch 1.7 this game has become unplayable, it freezes , cars just run into the back of you to often , palying AMS AND R3 now again Codemasters have messed up F1 Again			"

												Initially, I purchased this game because I wanted to see Rio Haryanto, because he is the pioneering Indonesian to join F1, So proud of him eventhough he didn't do it really well.Pros:Nevertheless, when I challenged myself to drive the car in manual and minimum assist (with keyboard!) I started to appreciate those who drive it in reality! I know there are many more realistic racing games out there, but the gameplay mechanic, the high-speed circuits characters, the dazzling in-game environment, the smart manual clucth release in starting grid, and many things in the game really require my stamina and focus! Drained my brain alot after 15 laps! I am old!Cons:-Maybe need more visual variatons in some pre-race events, e.g:  interviews in starting grid, variation in umbrela girls, more variations  and animations in winner stages.- I have Toyota Vios, 109 HP in real life, after playing this game for a while, people in my passenger seats starting to vomit.

												After years of unsecessful F1 games, Codemasters managed to develop a beautiful game based on the players' feedback. Well, better later than never. We have a nearly perfect F1 video game that can be both an arcade or sim. If you like this specific racing category buy this game and no other else. My rate is 9/10, good job codemasters.			"

												Amazing game, best F1 they made in years.I think that the fysics and how the car feel and drive is excellent and it feel more ""real"" than in previous F1 games.Well it just feel like I am driving a real F1 car, compared to previous f1 games.Sound is also great. the handling of the car is fantastic i think.The career mode is also kind of nice though it is kind of basic just like in previous titles. But you start as a new ""rookie"" driver in a low standing team. As time goes by and you practice and quality or win races you get tech points that you can invest in your car such as engine/aerodynamics ect.This make the game feel more like a career and what you do and select will as time goes make your car better so you finaly can compete with the top teams. As time goes by you also get some events such as your team expect you to do better than example possition 17.The game have many interesting features such as you during ther race from your wheel in the car can select what tires to pu on in an unexpected pitstop.Damage to the car seem rather realistic, and not only can you see things fall off your car, but also when you touch the barrier with your wheel you risk of getting a puncture so you have to to the pit.I did not play much yet, but game is beautifull.I dont know if the ai cars are good or bad yet, but for my 1 race experience they drive good, though they several times crashed into me from behind and damage my car ;-(  very annoying.I did not try multiplayer, but i hope we ""finaly"" can see things fall off other cars.All in all look like a really good F1 games.

It's not a sim in the rFactor sense, but in terms of playability, close racing and general enjoyment it's about as good as it gets right now.A few complaints about the AI's spacial awareness, the penalty system is still a bit inconsistent and the occasional glitch connecting to multiplayer lobbies but the rate of improvement from F1 2015 is staggering.

												This is a very strong title from Codemasters and a notable successor to F1 2013. I haven't tested F1 2015 and played F1 2014 only on one ocassion but the general impression is to skip those - since these two games hold the best of what the series has to offer. Improvements over F1 2013 and highlights in general: the AI is more lively, more human, challenging, but also rarely it can make some stupid mistakes which result in unwanted collisions - this is mostly against the human player, and not between themselves - although the transition between a perfect drive from the AI and a costly mistake is there- and sometimes you will witness mistakes from the computer driven cars - even collisions which result in the safety car. They can even occur in qualifying and practice.  Found the difficulty level adjustments to scale just fine - and the balance between the different tracks on same difficulty to be spot on. Watching AI cars race themselves is entertaining - sometimes you see 3 cars wheel-to-wheel - fighting for position.  Virtual Safety Car implemented accordingly, no bugs encountered with VSC or regular safety car. AI players use different strategies in qualifying - choosing either the softest or the next tyre option in Q2 - to approach the race differently. Car upgrades make their presence felt - times improving from one season to another on the same track and also from one race to another. Live weather transitions during race - very well represented and offer variety in gameplay Adjustable FOV and zoom  Warm up lap for those who may need it - I didn't find it useful Collecting points in order to make upgrade - a nice minigame - but can get repetitive and uninteresting rather fast - I usually use the ""Quali pace"" program to test setups and the ""Accomodation"" program for some warm-up laps - to compare myself with the AI and also for setup testing opportunities. Playable just fine with a basic, cheap wheel with no force feedback - with all assists disabled - and NO TC! Even though it's a bit more hard than F1 2013 with no traction control, don't get discouraged! You just need to exercise a bit at first - since this game is a bit more unforgiving on the gas pedal when exiting corners - but it's nothing exagerated. (Saw some opinions which recommend to turn TC to Medium at least - I say don't use it at all - it will only spoil your experience in the long run and eventually you will want to play with it disabled - and competing at Expert level without TC is fully possible - as experienced by myself - Even in heavy rain - if you have a good setup - you can master controlling the gas pedal just fine and having no trouble without any TC)Room for improvement: Pitcrew pit strategy suggestions are often bad or badly timed - not bothering.  The animations in the garage - when you need to switch from the Overview to the Setup window is unuseful and repetitive in my opinion - and I would prefer no animation in between - so that transition delay is minimized. <-- This would be a great improvement - if transition animations between Overview and Setup screens can be disabled. The mainstream graphics effects which don't improve the experience: lens flare (the most horrible!), bloom, dirty lens, etc. which should be disabled - most of them disabled through turning off Postprocessing "

												I have skipped the last F1 2015 due to mediocre reviews.I did hear good things about this one and when it went on sale the weekend of the new F1 season i took the chance to dive in.And man I am not disappointed, quite the opposite. Past games didnt have the details, the polish, many were quite buggy due to time pressure to release the game.You have 3 different Career modes which is great, the physics are great, the AI is very much improved from past games.In past games how my races usually ended up was starting at like place 17 because i like challenges and start with a slower car and work my way up.So i would start at 17 and because the AI in the past would be so slow, i would end up at like p5 after 1 lap but i didnt have a low difficulty, quite the opposte.What happens is, i get to 5, the cars in front distance themselves from me because I am a much slower car and the entire field would stick behind my♥♥♥♥♥because their pace is just that much faster, and I would not even drive that aggressively to get p5 after 1 lap, the AI was just that slow, so the races would always end up me trying to defend my place and getting outpaced by nearly the entire field.This game is different, a lot different. You can still make up many places at the first lap but I noticed there are a lot more ""group of cars"" meaning lets take my last race for example. I get from p6 to p4 in the first lap, one car would be right behind me, but then there would be a distance between that car and the ones behind while the Mercedes in front are just blasting off. Usually you won't have the entire field behind you waiting to pass you but rather 1-2 cars who match your pace a lot more than previous titles. I noticed i can overtake cars after 2 laps of the race because my pace would just be slightly better and the AI leaves you space, as you have to leave space for them, they dont ram you to death but rather expect you to let them pass like it would happen in real life. If you drive fair like them or a real F1 driver, the AI will be a lot of fun to drive against.I like the normal Career mode with the upgrading part, having these checkpoint,  tyre and qualification tests reward you for trying to practice a track and help you find the best line. I also on the Live TV feed watch the similarly fast AI and see which line they take if I notice im very slow in a perticular sector and then try to improve through that.I do not quite remember the previous parts but in this one you heavily notice the grip difference between the different tyres, you can see it visually when your tyre is at the end of his live, your driver has a face, you have many TV sequences like in the real League, it definitely does a great job putting life into your Career.Its greatly optimized, I have caught a little bug, on my 144hz Monitor and setting it up on 144hz it showed like huge black bars sometimes which made the game unplayable, tho this issue is entirely gone changing to 120hz.One little thing that I miss from past games is the Time Attack Challenge where the game offers some challenges where youd be put in a specific car on a specific track with specfic conditions, it is a great little indicator on how fast you are compared to your other F1 drivers, also i just really love time attack.In Conclusion, Codemasters have finally found the right formula, if they keep all the things theyve put in this one and just do their improvements year to year I will not complain but also they should then start to add more content, perhaps have 5 years of F1 car in a row in a special game or something but for now im very very happy with this game. Along with Codemasters own Dirt Rallye one of the best racing games I have played the last few years			"

												I love this game, after 7 years they finally got it right. No hardcore simulator, but exactly what I want to play. Great graphics, good physics, challenging AI, interesting career. PS: I played all F1 since GP2.			"

												I cant compare it to previous racing games except for project cars, but on that limited basis its a pretty good game. Though if you are new and intend to not use assits prepare for some serious frustration. PSA: A keyboard and mouse and basically unusable. The very least you need a controller and a steering wheel is a good investment if you plan on playing consistently.			"

												Finally. The game we've been waiting for! It's like the good parts of F1 2015 with the features from the old ones (but better) rolled into a neat package with a few extras too. A new challenge and so much fun. If you like F1 then buy it now!UPDATE 26/01/2017:DON''T BUY THIS ""GAME"". The offline side is great, everything I said above is accurate but the online is actually♥♥♥♥♥♥ The glitches are unbelievable! This game is UNPLAYABLE online. I'd recommend dipping a broom in used motor oil, shove it up your♥♥♥♥♥♥and bounce on a trampoline in an elevator before I'd recommend you buy this game for online use.			"

												The game is really good. I am not typical player of racing simulations but this one is seriously good one. I like that you can decide about team strategy before race and during race if conditions (weather, safety car, crash, ...etc.) change.Developers read and comunnicate with players before releasing this game what they want to see, and they (we) get it, thumbs up. -> safety car, warm up round, Very nice is also carrier mode, good level of AI, gameplay and your profile/status. Firstly you are starting as ""somebody"" and during carrier you are leveling up. Then you can change team or stay in your team. But carrier is still continouse, nothing will delete. I like! During practice you can seriously improve your car, byt finnishing technical practices... and much more...If you like racing, simulation, F1, carrier mode, nice graphic and reality... go for it!			"

												After scouring the internet and the codemasters official forum, I finally found a solution to the crash/freeze issue I have been having. Turing Particles OFF and shadows to low (everything thing else is HIGH) I am now able to race more than 10 laps. Before the game would freeze after 6 laps (consistently). For comparison, I tried the same thing in Dirt Rally and I am no longer having the same issue. So, I think it’s fairly conclusive that it’s an issue with the game engine. But on to the review. Now that I can finally race good stints without crashing the game is truly enjoyable. It is truly the best F1 title in the series. The presentation is spot on (they could do better with the faces but it’s all about the racing right), and I am enjoying the new career systems they have in place. I will say that I recommend this game but, be aware no matter what the benchmark test says if you are having issues you will have to tweak the settings until codemasters gets around to another patch. I'm hoping to upgrade to a 1070 soon so I will update again once I have that card. My current specs are; Win 10 ProIntel I-7 6700K32GB RAMGTX-970ASUS Maximus VIII Extreme			"

												excelent game better than all the others just a couple of slight issues with the rules in the game when following safety car nobody is suposed to overtake you until you cross the start and finish line and not at a saftey car point. And  if somebody does overtake you and then you retake the possition it tels you it was an eleagle manouver and have to give the place back !!!!!!. "

												First of all, I have another 300 hours on this game on Xbox, 250 on f1 2015 on xbox. And 5++ on F1 2013 on PS3. Played F1 Games since 2011, and is possible the best game since F1 2013. Not the best game for begineers on pad, I would reccomend f1 2014 to someone on pad, or maybe even f1 2015, it takes a while to get used to this game on pad. My issue is you feel disconnected from the car and it is difficult to find the lmit of the car , whereas in f1 2013+ 14 you can find the limit of the car and it feels very enjoyable to drive.However, this game has aruably the best ever career mode in the game sereies. Now ith AI which are 100x better then we had ever seen before, with the 2 new extra difficulties, ultimate and master. Now also with a new padock feature, however without the all important interviews that I personally really want back. R&D now is the best and most adavnaced it has ever been now with R&D points, and now there is the ability to take the worst car on the grid the best car on the grid. The multiplayer is much improved over the last game in the series however it is still absolutely awful, and the standard of driving is off the ♥♥♥♥ing scale, it's so bad. If your gonna buy a game to play online get f1 2014, the game is still realitvely alive with a lesser amount of players on here than f1 2016 but that is to be expected really. This game maybe possible the best for new comers though, because a decent player on pad with assists will be faster than someone without assists. Your going ot have to work out the setup hack for yourself though, as I am not willing to just tell you how to get top 10 on the leaderboard by running assists.In conclusion, if your new to the series, but are expereinced on your platform of handling Eg: wheel or pad; this game will be for you. However, if you are interested in clean racing maybe sign up to a league or something, because you will still atleast alot clearner racing than in normal online and u won't be scared about making overtakes. If your new to racing games on the whole, I would not reccomend ot especially if you want to play online.Changed my mind never buy it. The online is complete and utt er ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, all people can do is take you out, cause ur faster than them, and then they think they're better than you and think they know the f1 rulebook better than you when they have supported f1 for 2 years and you have for your entire life.

												Well, still looking for a good racing game on PC.My brother insisted to try F1 2016 due to good reviews.We both try it, we both uninstalled it 30 minutes after.It's, i think, the worse F1 from codemaster :- Physic is broken using gamepad. You cannot handle countersteering with gaz assist off. With assist medium, oversteerring physic is a joke. With assist off, you cannot drive.- Direction is so strange and not fluid even after lot of settings- Graphic are clearly a console port on PC (asseto corsa is far much better) with rear view rendering in 320x200- No multiplayer collisions (phantom cars when you approach your mate)- All tire temperatures the same, driving like hell cannot raise the temperature, no inner/outer/middle temps.- Totally boring after 10 min, due to full gaz assist while drivingRefund.
