												Of the three Ford games released on Steam,  this is the best, and is also the most   recent released;  having been released  six years ago (2008).  There are three environments to  race through;  desert, ice and water.   As with  the other ford games, there's little to like about this game, with handling little improved and  although    the graphics are an improvement on  the 2004 and 2006 releases  (Ford Racing 3 and Ford Street Racing respectively), they are still sub standard to many other racing games released back in 2008 (for example Need for Speed Undercover, which looks amazing and plays brilliantly  even today) that said,  the recently released  Colin  McRae Rally    was released before any of these ford  games and is far superior to all three games and is only a pound  more expensive.  My advice, either leave it alone, or, if you are determined to buy it, wait till the sales.  with 50% off,  it'll be less than a cup of coffee.  :) "

												Fist impressions:Drives like bumper cars (seriously, you bounce off obstacles), with decent controls which you ought to get the hang of quickly. Graphics are bad, sound effects are bad (it might be a good idea to turn up the music), car physics are a joke (though it does do simple damage), still the game is fun, and apparently it supports 2 player splitscreen operation.You need to find the PCConfig/Sysconfig application in the ""local files"" to change the graphics settings; be sure to choose a 3:4 resolution or the image will appear distorted.Get this dirt cheap for a laugh, and you won't be disappointed.

												This game reminds me of the Playstation era. I loved these types of games on my Playstation, not only were they addicting but they were exciting and fun, This game was released 6 years ago so don't expect a triple A title, but a simle arcadey style racing game. Very fun. Great time-waster. And a great racing game.7/10Seven out of ten because you couldn't really play this game for hours on end without feeling like it's getting repetitive. Because it really is the same thing over and over again, there isn't much tracks, and there isn't much cars, or gamemodes. But a great game and I would recomend it to a friend.			"

												It is ok, the game is good for a quick fix if you are in the mood for racing and need something cheap. The game is obviously old so there will be no suprise that the textures look somewhat simular to that of GUN for the gamecube. I (like most people I have seen) haven't played too much of this yet, however, I am eager to try out that split screen local multiplayer. So few decent games on the pc have local multiplayer... shame.			"

												Ford Racing: Off Road is the last game made in the Ford Racing Series (Of right now). But, to be honest, this game shows no improvement but a really big downgrade.PROS:1. Variety Of Trucks And SUVS- This game has a lot of todays Ford off road trucks and SUV and even has a few selection of Range Rovers.2. Tracks- A lot of tracks to choose from, but not at the start.3.Career Mode- This mode is about doing events and unlocking tracks, vehicles, and game modes.CONS:1.Graphics- The graphics compare to the other ford games is awful looking.2. Barely any settings-  Audio settings and thats it3.AI is faster than you- I find the AI to be easy sometimes, (Ford Escape is the literally the most OP car in the game) But they will bump you constantly and literally make the damage mode impossible to win.I dont recommend this game, but I do recommend to give it a go. If its on sale for a dollar.			"

												Now, I havnt played this game much but I dont feel like I have too.Ford Racing Off Road is a port from the PS2, and not a good one.First of all, there is no settings. What so ever. Again, its a port from the Ps2 but would still expect the ability to change resolution.The game does not give any intro of controlls or how the game works.The graphics are fine for a game made in 2008, and the game mechanic and feel of the driving is relative smooth.The carrer mode allows for a ton of races and since all seems to take around 2-10min to complete, you schould have hours of entertainment ahead of you, if this is the type of car game you want.When it comes to cars, its obv only Ford cars (Duh)The game dont allow custom cars or upgradeable cars, you can only buy cars thats listed with speed, ac and handling with the money you get from winning.Who would I recomend this game for? Ford lovers I guess, and people who like older car games. Dont expect action though. One hand controlling makes it really boring after a while.			"

												Despite being 3 years less old than Ford Racing 3, it's actually even worse. I didn't think that possible. You still can't change graphics, but at least they also removed the option to change the keymapping, and changing from mph to kph in the menu didn't affect the game - nor did turning off the music for that matter.

												I can enjoy simple racing games but I do expect them to be at least on par with games of PS1 generation .Everything in this game is bare minimum and many basic things that I have come to expect by default like car upgrades are not even here .Gameplay is not the strong point of this game because AI is too easy and since there are no good collision effects you can't even enjoy ramming people . In other words game has nothing going for it . I will say that map design for the most part was decent but that is kinda pointless if you basicly racing your own best score .Honestly it may be the most boring car game I ever played . I got it on sale and don't even think about buying it full price its not worth it .Note: If you want to change resolution you need to go to local content and find game Config .			"

												If I where to rate this game I would give it a 7.6/10. Dont except top-of-the-range grapics, but this game has quite good physics. It can also run on low-performance PC's (like mine). I recommend this because it is great value for the price.			"

												The game is good. I've completed it recently so I've decided to share my impressions.Casual players, people who like console originating-alike games or just like Ford and Land Rover rides will like it. To get the best experience don't forget to tune video settings and controls (community guide avaliable). And the game will look descent then and what's nice it runs smoothly on quite an aged machines. Has good variety of vehicles, so collecting them is a sort of separate pleasure to have. Choosing smart for each race makes it much more interesting. Also there are couple of game modes to choose.			"
