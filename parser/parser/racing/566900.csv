			Wacky Wings is available from Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/566900 This series features some of the best VR experiences you'll NEED to try when you get your OWN VR headsets!		

My Thoughts:A very cool racing game with an authentic arcade style vibe. If your new to the joys of VR this should be on your list to help you boost those VR legs (as they say). I translated 1 of the negative reviews and to be honest I didn't have a problem with any of the handling issues. it was fluid and responsive.ALSO If the Dev's are reading this.. I would have loved a replay option.... sat in the vehicles!  ;)Game Details:Launch into this idyllic, arcade-style ride and take to the skies to explore the thrilling and diverse VR world of Wacky Wings!

												So first of this is a great value. It is a fun ""feel the sense of flying and things zooming past your head"" kinda game and it is a solid game. The levels have a nice design and good artwork nice audio and music too. I enjoyed the sense of speed and the challenge was there. There are some levels I liked better than others. Some levels it's impossible not to earn platinum and live and others it is the opposite. Some you will blast through and others will proceedurally kill you with impossible situations. The city I found was the worst. Others were super amazing like volcano and caves. Pro tip: get the FUEL! Unlocking all the extras took longer than I thought. For example getting the Blitz mode required me to beat the regular mode. Blitz mode I didn't find that fun. Endless Mode was pretty fun as it is a bit more forgiving than regular but the speed gets much much faster! So far I'm 2.7 hours in and thats a lot compared to many titles. I think I've unlocked everything. Will I play again? I do like aviation so I will try the endless mode a couple times and perhaps use it as a demo for new to VR friends.			"

			After about 5.5 hours - I finally did it - got to endless mode, hit maximum pilot level and reached lvl 11 (in endless) - got pretty fast - but I like fast.		

I first heard of this game in relation to a competition to gain early access to Dimension Hunter - another game by Pocket Money - the stylized ""graphic novel"" looking shooter game -I saw the rules of this competition - to post your furthest distance traveled in Endless Mode - seemed doable - so I got the game for a little over $5 -What I didn't know was that in order to unlock Endless Mode, you have to kill 50 enemies in Blitz mode. To unlock Blitz mode, you have to have gold medals on all 40 levels - yes, 40 levels spread across 10 worlds. Worlds include:FarmSeaCaveCityUnder WaterVolcanoGiant (toy room)Spacesure i'm forgetting some -In Wacky Wings, you control a little flying vehicle or creature as you navigate your way through linear courses set with different themes (see world list above) - you use an xbox controller or motion controller to move the avatar around, collecting coins and fuel. Interesting things about the game - excellent handling - motion controls work very well with wonderful haptics, you can 'feel' when your fuel runs out - more than a rumbling, more like a torque/twisting inside the controller. You can swap between thrird person and first person view during gameplay - first person is very very immersive - I did not get sick one bit, others may be more sensitive, not a problem for me.Lots of different ""wings"" to choose from, including:delorean from back to the future W-wing (like an x-wing from star wars)Tardis from doctor whoperson on a broomstickdragonpropellor planehelicoptersubmarineMechanics of the game -FUEL: you fly down the course, and you need fuel - if your fuel runs low, you begin to sink to the grown and will eventually crash, fuel appears as a pickup scattered along the course. Pick them up and you are fine. COINS: You collect coins for medals - to unlock higher modes and new wings --- and you collect coins for increased handling/manuverability - cool concept, makes you want to go out there and get those coins so that you can pull off some tight turns. Overall -- strongly recommended, a very fun game with lots of replay value. pretty immersive, soothing gameplay - can play forever. Oh - and I livestreamed my gameplay from pickup to putdown ( in two chunks) - first session was almost 4 hours of me standing, playing the game (you don't have to stand, I like to stand). Second session, I hit endless mode and made it to lvl 11. The game is very inexpensive, but I think is worth at least 3 times the price. Fun! More fun than other games of the same variety, fun for the whole family. Gets your pulse pounding when you are going for a long stretch in endless mode. Here is me unlocking everything and drilling down to lvl 11 in endless mode			"

												This game is super simple fun. Randomized levels keep the game fresh and you have to stay on your toes. I recommend if you like infinite style runner games. 8/10			"
