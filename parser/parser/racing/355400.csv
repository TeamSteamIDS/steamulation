								The vehicle car shooter I've been waiting for. This is as close as I have come to the old memories of Twisted Metal 2 and Vigilante 8, which were hands down my favorite games in their time. I'm hoping this game will pick up in the next months as more content is added and the car shooter genre is refined once again. Cars - 4 to choose from for now, but each is different and feels like it. Cars are well detailed, especially for such a early release. One thing I would add to each car is somewhat of a back story about the driver. This would let you feel more in touch with the car/driver you chose. Characters with different personalities, and that reflects on the cars they drive and what special weapon/abilities the car has etc. This would tie in perhaps with a story mode, similar to what the old car shooter classic games had. Create some badas*es that makes you want to play them! Weapons  - The feel is a lot like Vigilante 8, especially the mortar and cannon. Good feel to the guns, nice graphics on the guns too. I was surprised by the detail on the weapons. Can't wait to see the special weapon for each car. I'm hoping it kind of ties in with what the car is, or with the character possibly. This will really set cars apart from each other.Maps - All maps are open space right now. Good for a quick death match, nice detail, they aren't too different from each other, cookie-cutter like as it's a similar space size wise just different setting. I'm hoping for an addition of cities, suburban areas, special parts of cities such as air ports etc. (Paris level in Twisted Metal 2 is a good example of what I have in mind) One of the maps in the game has special features that you can interact with to unlock a monster worm to attack. Nice touch, would like to see more interactions with the map and easter eggs. Some of the things I hope to see in the future would be boss cars, car unlockables, secret areas on map, and I do hope that the game ends up with a little more than just 8 cars to choose from, as that's the plan for now. Worth the 2.99, I almost didn't get the game because of the low price! I was thinking this will be a low budget feeling game that runs terrible. I was WRONG. It is worth it and I have my fingers crossed as this game develops. PLEASE don't abandon the project, bring back the car shooter genre!!!			"

								The game looks nice, I played it a little bit and was happy for what it currently is. More updates and more game modes are needed but for it being in Alpha it's all good.One thing, currently you don't have the ability to adjust the volume inside the game. However, I opened up a discussion on this matter and as I saw the game developer acted quickly and my request will be included in the future update. Cheers for that !Check out a gameplay video below:

								It's a good game.I'm bored of FPS games, and there are too many rogue-lites at the moment. This made me think back to what type of game I haven't played in a while, and memories of crushing my brother in Twisted Metal Black and beating Vigilate 8's campaign flooded my mind. This game is almost a year from release at the time of this writing and it's already fun to play. It's not perfect, you can abuse air movement to go faster than you should across the map, but that's also pretty fun. The only real issue is that I bought this too early and not enough people are on. Otherwise you would find me playing this at least as much as Rocket League.Buy the game so I can paralyze your vehicle and stick you with bombs.			"

								Good game that performaces great, is fun and cheap. The game is brand new and in early access, so it just needs more maps, sound options to turn down music and game sounds. I used to play Twisted Metal when I was younger, so this reminds me of that.			"

								First off, as a disclaimer: I did back this game on IndieGoGo, even though the campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.I love car shooting games. I've grown up on classic 90s games like Mario Kart 64, for the N64, and Twisted Metal, for PS1. With that in mind, ""Diesel Guns"" is arguably the best modern spiritual successor to these types of retro games thus far.The gameplay is very fun. I love the combat system, everything from the powerups, each of which are fun and cool, to the controls, which are very well implemented. I had no trouble quickly learning the controls.The AI bots seen ingame, when you set up your own matches, are pretty decent, although they do seem to have the attention span of an ADHD child, often losing interest in who they are attacking, or even will remain passive when they themselves are under attack.Before I list the good and bad aspects of this game, I do have to report a rather HUGE problem/bug with this game:The player cannot create their own username, instead it just uses the full name of the computer the player is using, which is compromising information that puts all players at risk, if the wrong person sees that info and decides to hack that PC. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP, PLEASE!That said, here are the good and bad aspects to this game: Good -Fantastic visual style, walking the fine line between realism and cartoony-Great map design-Well-animated vehicle models and combat animations-Easy-to-learn controls-Great sound effects Bad -Matches are too long by default. Given the fast-paced combat style, the match length should be considerably-shortened, say to something like 4-5 minutes max-Few playable maps and playable modes-Only partial controller support, not full controller support-Poorly-designed main menu. No game title or game art on the main menu-No in-game soundtrack Overall  This game is good, but could have benefited more from a longer development period, prior to launching on Steam. It has the feeling of being rushed.			"

								I don't even remember how I came across this title, but I'm so glad I did. If you're like me and grew up playing the legendary car combat titles of the 90s (Carmageddon, Twisted Metal, Vigilante 8, etc) you're going to most likely love what Diesel Guns has to offer. Before the game was on Steam Early Access, I had tried the demo on the dev's website. It's improved since then but it can only get better from this point! It's got your typical car combat, power ups galore, environmental hazards similar to what you countered in Vigilante 8 and Twisted Metal, and the game runs buttery smooth on my rig. It even plays nice with an Xbox One controller! The game apparently does have bots that play almost as good as human players, in addition to online play. In it's current state it only has 3 levels to pick from, and 4 different cars. The graphics aren't mind-blowing by any means but they are the best they need to be for this type of game that needs to be fast and not cluttered with a bunch of glitzy effects. I'm going to keep a close eye on this game, and I hope that it becomes a bigger beast. I'll see you on the battlefield!			"

								I have just came across this game today and was a little skeptical in whether I should buy and man did I have myself fooled. I do not even have an hour into the game and I can already say this game will be a favorite of mine. The game is very similar to Twisted Metal with a hint of Full Auto. Some of the vehicles in the game resemble the same cars filmed in Death Race. The graphics are decent and like how interactive the environment is. Even though there are 4 maps currently I can see that this game has a lot more on its plate. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Twisted Metal and would like to relive the good ol' days. Would highly recommend. My $3 well spent.			"

								Hey!This game were so cheapy when i did fall in love for it, then 1 month or less it increased a bit and it was the right thing to do, because with more money you'll become rich and we'll have a better support, so it's fair!In game!• Entered and oddly it recognized that i was playing through VR or something, every time i do open the game the Steam VR launchs side by side.• Closed VR, opened the Tutorial and... Bad FPS. Thats matter a lot you know? So i cancelled the Tutorial and opened the Config to set the things more ""low"" so i could continue the Tutorial!• Didn't worked that well but it's ""playable"" !LETS GO!• The Tutorial is quite easy, but it's obligatory and take 5 minutes... You understand how anxyosity can be destructive, but i controled it and concluded very well!• So lets P L A Y the R E A L - D E A L!• No, you'll N O  T!; The game didn't allowed me, it kept the loading into an eternal barrel-roll and then it disapeared forever! T R Y I E D - A G A I N! It appeared again! But disapeared again. Oh lord!• Ok... The Tutorial is... Obligatory so, i really don't wanted to play that but thats fine... But the game in fact don't work.• The menu is ugly, the controls are fine, the servers are enough for now (60ms isn't the best but it'll work when it work you know?).Why i do recommend this JEWEL?• Look at the models and the effects!; They really care about quality stuff so you can wait that when it becomes 1.0 it will fly low with high and beautiful graphics!• Seems familiar!; Oh baby! Vigilante 8 and Twisted Metal had a son and even it's name is cool man, D I E S E L - G U N S! It's totally male thing, explosions, beers, missiles, V8, blood and beautiful women! (You should really consider the last one and creating authentic chars to keep the game in our mind forever, like that hot lady from NFSU)• It's very cheap! It's not working (17/Feb/2017) but it's cheap!• I can see a glimpse of the future with this one! It will reach Rocket League success! And they will make cross-overs!• Local-coop! They will add local-coop if they became very very richs! So, lets make they RICHS!• WE DON'T HAVE CONTENTS LIKE THIS ONE, WE NEED TO ESTIMULATE THEY!Finally!; Thanks for making this game! i have great ideas about things that maybe you already imagined so i'll not importune you more. I hope you find resources to make this game great, because it's amazing, i loved it the first time i saw so i can say that you're in the right way to enchant people!...			"

								Really promising game. Graphics are great, I love the physics (perfect for a vehicle combat game) and weapons are nice and diverse. All it really needs is more cars, arenas, and some game modes like capture the flag or infected (one car starts off as the virus and has to infect the others, they all gang up until one survivor is left).Definitely worth $5 in its current state, especially since multiplayer works if you can find people.

								Absolutely one of the best vehicular combat games I have played in a long time! Brings me right back to the days of V8 and Twisted Metal! Weapon system is just like V8 as far as weapons go but the carnage screams Twisted Metal!			"
