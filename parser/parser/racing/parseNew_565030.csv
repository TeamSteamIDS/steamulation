								This game is legitimately amazing for anyone without motion sickness to just have a little fun for a little while. And if you have it, stay on the ground! It's an amazing game AND IT IS FREE! There isn't anything to hate, but if you really hate it, just get a refund for your free game... At least you tried it!			"

								The closest thing to flying like a bird so far, and yes it's closer than eagle flight. Using the motion controllers to manipulate each wing individually is very fun and allows for manuevers that make you feel like you're actually flying, gliding around in the classic map is great for just relaxing or doing intense dive bombs through the cuboid in the centre. If you get motion sickness maybe stay away from this, anyone else should give it shot.			"

								First VR app that really nails the dream of flightOh how do I put it? We have had the dream of Superman flight for ages.... now only in VR can this dream be realized!This free game is awesome, soar like Birdman over the scorched plains of Mars, the vacuum of Space, or the fantasies of Floating Island!It feels like Owlboy in VR, especially the Floating Island level.Now, keep in mind, this free game has no true objectives at all, it's purely for the fun and feeling of flying like a jet-powered bird. So go nuts, but there isn't any missions to speak of other than your own fun in the skies.			"

								I'm scared of heights, so this game certainly pushed all of those buttons...now I realize I wasn't really scared of heights, I was scared of not having jetpacks attached to my elbows. 10/10 - Would get over my fear of heights again by attaching jetpacks to my elbows. It's worth noting, this game has crashed both times I've tried to play it, and I only get a good 10-15 mins in before it happens. Only game that's done that so far. I monitor my hardware's stats, and not seeing anything that'd explain it on that end. Either way, crashing or not, this game is fun and worth trying. Still recommend.			"

								A great deal of unrealized potential.There are guns that hint that there might be some sort of combat. There are hidden sections in a few of the areas that hint that there might be some scheme to ""break free"" of the standard areas. There is dialogue that hints that this is not the most legitimate facility and that you should be attempting to break free. There are courses that suggest you should be able to fly outside of the course itself.None of this is ever realized in any parts of the game I ever came across. There is NOTHING to shoot, not even a single thing in any area that even responds to being shot, not even leaving burn textures behind that would at least allow you to pretend you were shooting targets. There is one area that doesn't seem to have any bounding box,(space) but all that does is make it almost impossible to find your way back if you go too far.However this may all change in a future update. For what it is, the controls and gun/flight mechanics are... interesting. They could stand to change the angle the the thruster gun objects are in relation to the Vive wands, which could make them more comfortable to use, but for the most part, the flight itself is an enjoyable experience. I use a constant floor bounding area in my Vive settings though, which may have helped reduce nausea, as the flight is apparently too much for some people to handle, at least from what some of the discussions and other reviews have mentioned.I recommend this game, really only because it is free. If it cost even a single dollar, I would expect at least some sort of content (missions to carry out, targets to shoot, secrets to find? something?) before it would be worth that investment, but for free, the only requirements I have behind my recommendation is that the VR is stable and basic controls work as expected. That much it succeeds in with flying colors.Just as a side note, the highest speed I was able to achieve was around 1300km/s. I didn't notice any particularly effect approaching a blueshift.			"

								Tons of fun. If you've ever wanted to fly this game definitely provides that in an amazing way and there's a bunch of areas to explore while you do. I expected this to make me feel gross but I didn't have any trouble with it. The only thing that made me a little uncomfortable was the hyperloop and the strobing effect of the tube and in space I felt like I didn't have as much recognizable control, niether made me feel off for a lasting period of time.

								Basically just a fun little game that lets you fly around several different areas. (Places like a satellite, an island, some hills, etc) The developer has plans to implement multiplayer and such, so I'd keep an eye on this game. Still fun in single player, though! Overall I'd reccommend it, it's the base of something great.Do bear in mind that it's not for those that are prone to motion sickness.			"

Incomplete, partially broken experience that you just have to try.Blueshift, formerly known as Brian's High Velocity Research Center, is a must-try VR experience.  You get to take off like a plane or glide across the ground like a skateboarder with rockets. That said, the best aspect of this isn't gameplay but the scale of the objects, which gives you a sense of both vertigo and excitement.The game is far from polished and nowhere near a completely developed environment.  There are many holes or missing areas in the environment which ruin immersion and cause confusion.  There are also some quality of life features missing entirely, like the back button to choose another level or a compass to locate the ship that takes you back.  When you go back to the main level, it just teleports you back into the starting position rather than giving you a way to move back into the level selection room from the place you were.  The levels differ greatly, which is good, but the gameplay mechanics change between levels a little more than I'd like.  The wings only show up on land levels, for example.This game needs some love from its developer, but it shows a lot of potential.  It's worth trying, because it's free after all.			"

								Brian's High Velocity Research Center (besides being a long name to type) is an incredibly fun flying game. Attached to both your hands you have guns that can shoot and be used as jetpacks that also can spout wings (it sounds weird but makes total sense while playing). The game feauters no enemies (at least that I saw) and allows you to fly (and ski like in the Tribes games) across giant maps and landscapes. The game is incredibly fun and gave me no motion sickness (despite the incredible speeds you go at). Despite being free the game does not sacrifice graphics or gameplay for the price and I completely reccomend it for anyone looking for a fun, relaxing unique experience.			"

Standing on the space station and looking out over the planet below was so awesome.  and that was just one of the times in this game that gave me one of those ""VR moments"".No VR sickness at all and some bad loco or bad framerates will give me VR sickness.

								I see talk of motionsickness issues. I agree there are portions which are like that, but the open areas are much better than the home tutorial map. It is very closed off, therefore your perception of the fast motion is greater. It took me w hile to learn the gradual thruster control (Don't click touch pad, but just touch it, and the thrust increases from bottom of the touchpad to the top. Click the touchpad for full thrust no matter what part of the touchpad you are clicking.) Another way to help motion sickness on this one is to stay seated in a swivel chair. That especially helps when navigating closed areas, and the slide-coasters.Better name! Would like to see more interactivity with objects. Maybe I missed it on one ov the levels, but I did not see any use for the guns. Even target practice while soaring and attempting to control your flight path would be a fun challenge! Or there could be targets along the sides of the different slide-coasters! Looking forward to your next developments! I'd be willing to pay for this title with additions like those. Keep up the good work!			"

Controls were extremely easy to pick up and although it's not physically (ie with physics) accurate when on land (I can come in super hot to the landing, turn my wings sideways, stop immediately, and fall right onto the platform) it's really fun to be a bird. In the space level, I like that it was all based on how I positioned my rockets as opposed to the wings, which wouldn't work in space. I tried zooming between trees but it seems either I'm really big or the trees' hitboxes are bigger than they look but again, for free it's great. Looking forward to what else happens.			"

Exiting and restarting the game to see a new area is mildly annoying.  Still, would reccomend this because it is free and a cool little game to demo VR to those who are not initiated yet.			"

								I think this is my frist review ever, maybe second. I have 60 vive games, and none of them have me as excited as this game. I just flew around the city, and with the guns and ranking, I imagine this is going to become a multiplayer of epic proportions. Hopefully there will be upgraded guns, leveling, new skills, upgraded wings and jets, etc. This is very fun just zooming around with no one else there. I imagine an MMO for this game will be the best experience on the vive hands down.			"

For those who don't realise, this game is being developed by the dev of VertigoHot damn,  this game.I am not usually one to write reviewsfor games - I actually couldn't tell you the last time I did it, or the game I did it for without going and checking now. But holy hell. This game is already among my favourite Vive games. The freedom it gives is astounding and the movement system is fantastic. I don't get any kind of motion sickness at all (Though, to be fair, I'm yet to have a game give me any kind of nausea).Honestly, even if you only have a spare 10 minutes to have a little play around, I can assure you this free little gem is 100% worth your time. Can't wait to see where it leads.Thanks, Devs! Keep up the good work!			"

								Stioll buggy, but that is to be expected for an early access game that is clearly being developed by a garage team, or just a dude in a garage.  That said, it is very fun, the concept is solid and the potential shines through.  Mine bugged out on the returns, so I had to keep shutting it down and reloadiong to tyry a different world, but still, the potential for deathmatches in these spaces was clear, and would be a blast.  Combo downhill/slalom with deathmatch thrown in, kind of like rollerderby with guns, would be a blast, among other things, and I look forward to seeing how it progresses.  Download it, have ten minutes of fun, then kep an eye on it over teh coming months.  Dufusses who post negative reviews about an Early Access game not being fully realized and buggy should be banned from Steam, not to mention the prat who gave a Not Recommended because he didn't have a VR headset yet.  ID10T's aside, this is a free game, and as such is worth every penny.  In the future, I have high hopes.			"

								SOOOOOOOOOO cool. This ""tech demo"" as it is right now has a unique freedom of movement. i love the wings and sugest adding wing suit alternative  costume or maybe a pair of lazer blue jet airplane wings, maybe some rings to fly through for trick flying games. Obvoiusly if dogfighting multiplayer rooms were added some day this game could make some real cash. Totaly still in development dont expect a goal or score yet but it is liberating to rocket to the top of the map then use the wings to glide down and land like a bird. MUST TRY. --support this dev!--			"

								It's quite unfinished but a very engrossing experience all the same. Flying around, manoeuvring and landing on buildings is oddly entertaining. The flying around becomes quite intuitive after a bit of time. There's a few different locations, nothing massive and the textures are basic but functional.Right now this is just a demo showing early potential, it's nothing more but flying around. However that alone is worth trying out.			"

								Great flying mechanic, weapons feel powerful and satisfying.  The aiming system is fun to use in conjunction with cruising around.  Currently not much to do besides fly around and try to follow some roller-coaster type ramps.  If this game had ANYTHING to shoot at, even if it was as simple as destructible targets littered around the maps, but ideally multiplayer death matches, this would easily be one of my go to games.   Positive recommendation mostly to encourage the dev to keep at it.			"

								I've found that when one is traveling at high speed and destined for impact into a concrete half-pipe, do NOT brace for impact. Simply closing one's eyes is much easier on one's real life surroundings.			"

								There's less actual moving about in this game than any other I've played , yet this is the only game that's almost had me falling over. It's a very real sense of motion and a lot of fun, even if I have no idea what I'm doing.			"

								Great so far, despite it not having any actual game to it yet. I really like how it controls. Unlike other VR games that i have tried that do not rely on teleporting to move, this one actually didnt make me feel dizzy at all. Cannot wait to see how this turns out			"

								It's a cool game, but verry much in development, not much to do except fly around solo. Hopefully it will turn into a multiplayer PvP or PvE soon, would be nice.			"
