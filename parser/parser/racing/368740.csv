If you think I missed something in my review feel free to tell me	I will update my review if I find more	Obliteracers    Obliteracers is a racing, action, and possible friendship ruining title that is very fast-paced. I will add a TL;DR at the end. GameplayObliteracers can be classified as a racing title however it is more of a chaotic free-for-all than anything else. You get to choose from a selection of 16 racers in local or online modes and are limited to the character Sarge in the single player career mode. This is chaotic as you can play modes where you try to barely survive, kill everyone else or stay in front and let your ignorant competitors give you points by destroying each other. Obliteracers also has something which is absolutely amazing and that is 16 player local games. You can connect through gamepads, laptops and smart devices using them as controllers. If you die do not worry you can still lock on and fire rockets to help people or get revenge against the one person who dared go against you, then realize that next round he only wants to kill you and no longer cares about winning. You can also create games from a selection of 33 modifier, 3 presets for mixtures of modifiers, 3 saveable mixtures and 12 maps. Obliteracers is easy to pick up and play and even has a drop in and drop out feature, it’s easy to grasp and fun to master. It even has a preset if you are playing with friends who are new to the game to give losing players bonuses. Overall a great game to play with friends for sure and seems to hold a mixture of Wrecked Revenge Revisited and Mario Kart to create a fun and destructive game. GraphicsI am a fan of Mario Kart and this games graphics remind me of it as they are cute, innocent,and colorful. That is until you collect your first weapon powerup and it becomes a deathmatch. The music is innocent and upbeat to help keep you in the mindset to have fun.Pros/ConsPros + 16 local player games+ Game involvement even after death+ Fast-paced and quick rounds+ Easy to learn+ Great amount of replayability + ModifiersCons - Small amount of players online currently - Easy to get eliminated at the beginning (as much fun as it is to use rockets it’s also fun to race)SuggestionsHere are some suggestions I feel would improve the game- More racers- More maps- New methods to attack racers after deathFinal ThoughtsObliteracers is a great party game and I cannot wait to try it the next time me and my buddies hang out (there is usually around 8-12 of us so great to have up to 16 in the local game!).  I was always a fan of Mario Kart but this is Mario Kart subtract the laps and add the battle mode into the racers. It is a mix of Mario Kart and Wrecked Revenge Revisited done amazingly well. Combining the best elements of both games to create a great party game to play and enjoy with friends or even play alone.TL;DRObliteracers is a great party game and has up to 16 player local games. Mix some great elements on Mario Kart and Wrecked Revenge Revisited to be awarded with Obliteracers. Overall easy to pick up and has a great amount of replayability especially with 33 game modifiers.** Key was provided by developer for review purposes ** If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

The game controls like most kart racing games, except you all share the same camera. Similarly to Speedrunners, if you fall out of the screen border, you die. However, you can also be killed by weaponry. There are multiple weapons that allow for strategic play. Mines, slippery liquid, homing missiles and fire out of your sides.You have the ability to bring up a shield at any time, that will negate any damage you take, but slow you down while you use it. You also have the option to hold up your shield as you drive into a weapon pickup, which will heal you, but in turn destroy the weapon. It's a nice trade-situation that allows you to choose.My favourite game-modes are the ones where you don't respawn until the next round. This means the race gets more intense as you play. When you are dead, you have the option to skip to the next round if only bots are in play, or aim a crosshair and shoot at any racers you want. This allows you to kill someone who is doing better, to even the playing-field. The interesting thing is, if multiple players are dead, you all control the SAME crosshair. So you're all battling over who to kill, it's quite hilarious.I should mention how great the multiplayer is by the way. You can play up to 16 players. Bots or humans. With a keyboard, controller or even a smartphone. The system to drop in a new player is quite seamless, and even allows for local & online play at the same time.There's a career mode if you want to play through something alone, although there isn't really anything that interesting to it in my opinion. It's the same as versus mode but with a bit of funny text at the beginning, and it cycles through maps and game modes.Something pretty fun is you can activate modifiers for races, which keeps things interesting like  doing reversed controls, or the people losing are a bit faster.Overall, it's a fun racing game with a very nice art style. I love the characters, the world and the gameplay is quite a blast if you have some people to play with!			"

												I've been waiting for this game since the Steam XMAS sale brought it to my attention, its pure unadulterated mayhem. You will be cursing out random cartoon drivers none stop.This isn't a traditional racer, or much a racer at all to be honest. If you want Kart action this isn't your game, I repeat there is very little actual racing. What this is a FFA murderfest though that has driving as the medium. It's generally played as Deathmatch or Last Man Standing, where you keep respawning, you get kills/points by destroying and knocking people off the map or lasting the longest, there isn't a difference other than looks in the Racers, everybody goes the same speed turns the same etc etc. If you want a game you can turn on and blow some steam this is great, I cant speak for how well the local multiplayer works, but I was playing with about 10 people online an hour after the launch, depsite having racers from Russia, Britain, Canada, Germany(host) and the USA, it was still respectably playable with 100-200 ping. Did I slide off the course a few times because of the lag the odd time? Yes. You forget about it 20 seconds later because another round starts and the game is just awesome.			"

												I don't really get how this game did recieve so many positive reviews, because it has some obvious problems and they are crucial.First and major problem - 80% of the time you are literally gonna watch someone playing and oh boy if it isn't fun. There are plenty of game modes, but most of them split races on rounds in which 60-80% of players die in first 4 seconds.""So play in another modes"" - you would say, but here is another problem. On a third day after release there are less than 10 people in online. There is literally nothing to play. (not game's fault, but its a multiplayer title so you get the point),Lack of content. The soundtrack is enjoyable at first and annoying after 20 mins of game session. There are only 4 racers (with some recolors, so they say ""16"") to chose. Maps look different artistically, but the tracks feel the same. And at last - the controls, I've played on 360 controller and its pretty personal opinion, but it's not that fun to play it. They just don't feel smooth and then you add a mess, which usually happens at races this problem becomes really frustrating.The only way I see that game being worth a purchase - to serve an option to play when you have a party at home.

												Look.People are saying stuff about the camera and whatnot (maybe the controls.)But it's a party game. The camera HAS to be like that.Sure, It can be annoying. But that's how it has to work. Splitscreen is annoying, and this game is good for parties.Oh yeah the music and the levels are great. I can't wait til this game takes off.EDIT: i'm making this a progressive review. If you aren't sure about buying this, this review is probably your resort. So, read along, buyer.2/29/16: You'd think that 16 players in one game will be horrible. No WAY! the bots are fun to play with in 16 person mode! It's mayhem (in a good way)!1/3/16: The music isn't repeatative. The racers are unique. Gosh, i still love this game. I just played some of the same map for a while. Didn't notice!3/3/16A match daily is like an energy booster. 10/10			"

												This game is a 16 player ♥♥♥♥ show. It's amazing.Think speedrunners meets mario kart.That's it, you've got it.also, after you die, everyone's combined inputs for a reticle to attack any one player.get 15 friends with 15 phones and a projector.and probably some beer...get beer.That's a good time in the making.

												I usually don't buy or play racing games, so I want everyone to understand exactly where I'm coming from when I write this review.Obliteracers is great, hell, it's freaking fabulous.I've been looking for a party game that I could play with my friends or with people online for a while now, and after playing this, I know I've found it. 16 player, drop-in drop-out multiplayer, scream at the monitor hilarious mayhem.I love that smartphones can be used as controllers (more games need this, get on this other developers, license this tech for your games!) and it only takes an hour or two of practise to get a handle on it, (I recommend going 1-1 with a beginner bot on an Endurance style game using the ""relative"" controller layout until you get used to it).The music suits the game perfectly, it's fun and upbeat, like the game. The community I played with on launch day were great, applauding rivals wins and laughing at the chaotic carnage (but please if you are playing with a mic, use headphones to cut out the feedback, we thank you). ;)And the game modifiers, wow, so many options. Try the combination of, no pickups, drift gift, pinball, ice skating and the floor is lava on Survival, most insane fun I've had in ages.If you are looking for a party, or a kart style game, you should get this one, I highly doubt anyone would regret dropping the asking price (less than $20 aussie dollars) on this excellent game. This will be the game I gift to friends for their birthdays this year (if you are my friend, forget you just read that).Would (and will) obliterate cute alien racers again. 10/10			"

												Great game! The multiplayer is fantastic. It reminds me of MarioKart but is way better and keeps all 16 players involved. Very fun game. Could be great for LAN parties. Also, the price is right. Check it out!(Yes, I know it has LAN capabilities. That is why I mentioned it. I didn't ever say it wasn't available. I just haven't done it yet, hence the ""could"" instead of ""is"".)			"

												It's a blast with friends! I have three controllers and a couple of roommates and they all love this game! The maps are fun, characters are cool and the weapons are pretty diverse. Best of all, max 16 players! Add tons of bots on easy mode for maximum mayhem.The thing I don't like is the amount of maps, there are only a couple that are not totally slippery. (4 maps in 3 different weather modes each, but we pretty much only like the non-wet modes). Story is pretty barebones too but if you play this as a purely party game like we do it doesn't matter. So if you buy it for solo play you probably will be disappointed, and not too many people online either. The local multiplayer is its best feature.There are other games with friends, like Speedrunners, and I like Sonic ASRT for karting, and Obliterators is a mix of the two. The price isn't bad either.

Obliteracers - Party Cart Racing on PCFull Review[gonewiththewin.com]Jazzy beats. Colorful levels. Codgy old racers. This is fun little racer with an aura of charm around it. Enjoyable cart racing and destruction in single player and online. A very well designed and built game, that is challenging in large groups. Fans of arcade racing with a humorous twist will love Obliteracers. My only caveat is the mobile device controls. Don't rely on them very much. Very difficult to control this way, although a nice idea, and players with real controllers will have a clear advantage.PROs- Great graphics, weather effects, and level design.- Jazzy soundtrack, old grumpy racers... just need a cane!- 16 player versus and a great single player campaignCONs- Mobile controls need work, very hard to play this way- AI is not challenging in small groups.- Get lost in the crowd super easy.

Lan PartiesOk So downloading this game it seemed frightening at first with the controls and gameplay style. But now after playing 10 mins of the game I’m already loving it. I see that this game has a massive future in gaming with lots of friends. One of the first games that I’ve seen which allow many users to play at the same time on the same screen. Also the fact that people can play on their phones, tablets also allow everyone to join in and participate in the game.The Game's FutureOk so, the online community is very friendly indeed. I’m always seeing heaps of open servers that are packed with friendly and fun people. With all of this taken into account, I see a very good future for this game. It’s one of many which provide a unique lobby of 16 players with heaps of custom power-ups, interesting maps and characters. Hopefully with more to come. This game has a huge amount of potential. With 4 possible game modes already, adding more would make this game even more interesting (if that’s possible).I recommend this game for everyone to try out. Its defiantly one that'll provide enjoyment for hours on end.			"

												Soo, we bought this game with 2 of my friends and it seems to be... Empty. No servers, no lan whatsoever, we can't connect each other, we can't find each other, game looks like a single player to be honest. And interesting thing is, there is absobloodylutely no solve around, either in steam reviews or twitter page, nowhere. I'm not sure that we're doing something wrong, but it isnt rocket science, we say host, we say join, and we find jack. I'm gonna go ahead and give a negative on this one, if someone knows how to fix it, feel free to comment. 3 days afterwards, we'll refund it.Edit: Developers were extremely helpful, they added a FAQ section in order to clear the air about multiplayer connecting. You guys can check it out from here;

I got a key from the developer for the review. It doesn't change my opinion in any bit whatsoever.Pure ChaosObliteracers is a deceptively fun concept that runs on the novel connectivity and accessible of 16 player local-multiplayer. Rather then racing to the end of the goal, it's all about destroying your opponents in absolute chaos.Pros:The game's technology works. I was instantly able to connect my phone to the game and it was very responsive.The game's artstyle and graphical fidelity is decent, but can surprisingly handle itself on lesser hardware as well. Optimization is not too perfect, but it's fairly good, and fairly playable.Despite being chaotic and often being busy with a ton of players, the game's added shield mechanic prevents the game from simply encouraging players to throw items everywhere.The maps may seem less interesting and more repetitive in terms of design, but it works here mainly because of the action in the maps.A lot of ways to modify multiplayer games, and many ways for people to play!Highly polished and playable. It's a good thing they didn't release this during Early Access.Nitpicks:Jazzy and entertaining music, but is looped way too much, making it sound incredibly grating at timesControlling the game with a mobile device is incredibly hard, and that's because of it's steering controls. It will take awhile to get used to, and the developers told me that it's best if you practiced the control-type with a regular controller or in a more isolated situation first.Career Mode isn't too interesting in particular, and is generally not that long to play through either. Those playing alone may find this in particular very worrying.The original keyboard control scheme is uncomfortable to play with.Cons:Very little character variety. 16 characters, most of them being based off of the 4 main racers of the game. It doesn't matter to say the least, but I would had liked to see a lot more variety then 4 separate versions of Sarge.Content in general is a lot smaller then I hoped for, but it's still a alright price tag for its' multiplayer experience.The lack of players for it's online component really worries me. The game needs to find some way to gain traction or you can forget ever playing a full lobby online.FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEW:

Obliteracers is absolutely fun. Playing with friends has been an enjoyable romp and even it's lackluster Career Mode holds up better thanks to the game's insane and chaotic nature being both easy to understand and fun! It's polished and immensely playable, and this is backed up by how accessible it also is.

The game's main hook is that up to 16 people can play at once. Have a phone, or a laptop, or a controller? Whip it out, and you can join in on the action very easily. It's simple, and it's responsive too. Although steering with a mobile device ended up being a disaster, it was otherwise surprisingly responsive. No input lag was experienced whatsoever connecting it with other devices.

Unfortunately, it's single-player side is a bit light, which is fine, but because Obliteracers' servers are going to be peer-to-peer versus being dedicated, the online is going to majorly rely on the amount of people playing. It's career mode is just a bunch of set-up matches and isn't particularly too interesting, or even remotely that large of a challenge. Solo players may be turned off by this, but for those who have a ton of friends/family members to play with, it's the perfect couch game to play.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756564The amount of game-modes, maps, and characters aren't substantial or large, so I'm hoping the developers will continue adding more content as time comes by. The game modes are fun though, although most of them deviate from the main formula of ""kill everybody"".On the bright side, it's mutators keep the matches much more interesting; stuff like ""Staying on the floor will kill you"" and ""Everybody bounces around like a literal pinball"" shake a lot of races up, reinventing how to play. I think these mutators are going to really make matches Presentation-wise, it's decent. It's soundtrack is great to jam out too (if it wasn't constantly looped over and over), it's visuals look nice, and the UI doesn't interfere with the game. The menus are fairly basic but get the job done.The controls may take some getting used to in general, but one notable issue I have is sometimes it wouldn't respond when I started the race accelerating. It's happened multiple times while playing with a phone, controller, and keyboard.The combat emphasis on the game isn't just a chaotic mess either. You can put up a shield to keep you invulnerable from attacks but you won't be able to accelerate (And the weapon you're holding will drop). It's a cool mechanism that places a risk in the game; Do you want to try and keep the weapon, and attempt a counter attack? Or do you want to drop the item and shield yourself to prevent total devastation? It makes the game much more interesting then ""SPAM ITEMS EVERYWHERE!!!"".The online unfortunately is not that populated. Sometimes, you can find a large game of at least 7 people. Other times, it's as empty as it was before the game came out. It's sorta disappointing that the game didn't gain enough traction, since not everybody is going to be able to invite their friends over all of the time.TL;DROverall, Obliteracers is a great game! It's stuck with a few flaws, some weird optimization/control glitches, and a already dead online, but it's a game that's so damn fun and absolutely chaotic.FINAL REVIEW: Definitely Recommend; Players playing the single-player/online should wait for a sale, anyone who likes party games should pick it up now!For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!

												Amazingly fun multiplayer competitive action. A great party game, as everyone can play even with their smartphone.But as a classic game, it's a lot of fun, it creates very interesting revenge dynamics, and unlike more ""race"" based games of this type, it's not about being ahead of the pack because it puts you in disadvantage. It's simple enough that anyone could play it and enjoy it, as it's chaotic, but you can master some strategies and get good at it, to better humilliate your friends. A must for local gaming, a new classic has risen.			"

												The party karting scene is back.  Not that it went anywhere, bt PC options for such games have always been hit-or-miss.  This is a definite hit.  It's a blast!  I haven't had the chance to try a local party yet but that's goign to happen soon.The controlls are intuitive and easy. The play is frenetic and fun.  The characters/vehicles are nonsensical and perfect  The weapons are silly.  The modifiers are hilarious.  this is the perfect family party game or drinking party game, or party party game. I run this game on my MSI GS70 Stealth (Nvidia 870M) with no issues at all on Very High settings. It's not super graphically intesive and it doesn't need to be.  It's perfect, really.  If you aren't getting this game, you are certainly making a mistake.  I can't imagine this game not appealing to anyone.			"

												Don't go into this game thinking it'll be like Mario Kart or other similar games. The aim of the game isn't to race, its to obliterate (duh, title) the other racers (however, you can get far enough ahead of other players that they disappear of the screen, which kills them). This seems to be one of the biggest complaints about the game, and if people spend 1 minute reading the description they would understand what the game is about.Depending on which game mode you play, you get points for killing other players, either by using powerups or knocking them off the racetrack. There's also an elimination-type gamemode where you get points for being the last one alive in a round. Powerups are fairly common throughout the racetrack, and the players can shield their car from attacks from powerups, though this will drop or deactivate any powerup they currently have.Very fun and zany game, and could be great at LAN parties, as you can connect to the game using your smart phone/tablet and use it as a controller.

												Great fun! I've been looking for a replacement to match the local play highlights of Micro Machines, Micro Maniacs and Mashed and FINALLY something has come along to fit the bill. While it's not a direct descendant, this is probably the closest game I've played to Mashed in a long time - but with all the modern day extra you'd expect. Loads of mods to change up the races, plenty of maps, great weapons (all very similar to Mashed, but again, tweaked perfectly).I keep going back to Mashed because I was hugely disappointed by Mashed's follow-up Wrecked. This feels like the game that Wrecked should have been - the core driving mechanics are perfect for this type of game, and the quick drop-in, drop-out means any frustration is forgotten almost instantly. My only con so far is: Where is everyone? :(			"

												What a treat! This amazing Kart racing, Obliterating, Insane Racing game is as i said AMAZING!The game is not just a really nice to pick up and play when you wanna burn some time, you easily get into the game and have really fun (while swearing alot) with your friends or other players trying to kill as many of them as possible. The artstyle is cute, cartoonish and just right for this kind of game. The soundtrack is really good, making the game even better. As for the gameplay, the controls are both good and easy too use, personally i recommend using a controller but with alot of friends you will have to get used to the smartphone controls (they can be a little clunky in the beginning). The game modes are all fun and different, there is easily a game mode for all of us in there. The maps are beautiful and cool and the way of making some harder by adding different weather conditions was really cool and immersive. The multiplayer was also really fun, never had any issues connecting to other people and rarely lagged when playing on other peoples matches.Overall i would give this game a (9/10), i can really see the potensial in having alot of fun with friends and playing for many hours straight, the artstyle and soundtrack is really good and it just helps the game shine even more. The game also runs really well and is easily played without any problems. For this price i would really recommend the game for everyone who likes these kind of games, heck even the people who dont like the Kart racing type of games migth enjoy this!Graphics (9/10)Gameplay (10/10)Soundtrack (9/10)Replayability (7/10) with friends (10/10)			"

												Ive usally dont write review here!But hell this game is so damn fun! for those who play Mario kart, then you got to loved this game! It's one of those game when you just have a long day at work want to go home and play something fun, relaxing and bring you laughter then i will highly recommend you get Obliteracers, for the prize of the game is so damn worth getting.Obliteracers bring you high level intensity game play with unique in game shield mechanic, what made this game so fun and challenging with able to block your opponent cheesy sneak attack moves by predicting, and able to counter play and out play your opponent by having that shield up feels so damn good.The healing mechanics also cool, able to heal yourself every time you go past the weapon drop, can turn that into healing yourself by holding down the shield bottom, which is also cool feature of the game.What I've also enjoy about this game is you can play up to 16 players! Or host a game and play against 16 of your friends, or online against other players!Overall this game is extremely fun, promise this game bring you heaps of laughter with unexpected things happened to you in game!With the prize of this game, fair to say its definitely worth getting, such friendly envoirment in game and great community!Shout out to the Developers and Micheal for making such a fun game to play!Melbourne Australia !Keep up your hard work fellas!

												I was hoping this game would be easiewr to pick up by a novice gamer. Then you have a game that a bunch pof people can play together, whether or not they are experienced players.Fun concept, but it is hard to control the character and it gets very confusing when there are above about 6 racers. in other words, if you are looking to play this game drunk with your bunch of friends who vary in gaming skill, dotnt get this one.

												I have very mixed feelings about this game, but I'll go through my pros and cons.Pros- Catchy Music- Colourful enviornments- Wide variety of power ups- Story Mode is generally easy and let's you try over and over again until you succeedCons- Repetitive character sounds- No variety in taunts- Lack of Diversity in characters with unoriginal and unimaginative reskins of the original 6-8 ones you can choose from.- ""Story Mode"" should just be named ""Training Mode"" as there is no story there at all.- Drifting is difficult- Races can be too quick when 10 or so people die at once- Fall out of frame of the screen and you're dead (I understand it's supposed to be that way but I'm just not a fan)- Respawn doesn't give you any time to catch up to other racers properly (You can die within 1-3 seconds of a respawn if you're not immediately drifting because you fall behind and you're off the screen)It's tough to recommend this game but if you can master drifting you stand a chance in multiplayer. Otherwise you're limited to doing versus with your own friends or story mode over and over.  "

												Obliteracers is a terrific take on the local PvP/arena combat genre. It's a Mario Kart/Bombsquad matchup. There's not really any actual racing really so much as a vehicular assault game. Basically, this game takes the game modes from arena pvp games (deathmatch, survival, etc) and puts them on a track. The controls are super tight. Everything works as it should. The only caviat to this is the phone controls, which DO work really well, but the inherent flaws of working on a touch screen really show themselves here. With no tangible feedback or physical buttons to reference, you will be looking at your phone as often as you will at the game.With half a dozen courses and several varients there's enough track variety to do the job. There's a really good variety of weapons that all feel unique and valid in certain scenarios. A couple might be OP (oil slick) but overall it's a good showing.If you are a fan of local PvP/party games, this one is a must have.			"

												It's pretty fun. Micro Machines, Vigilante 8 ish, with a side order of Mario Kart but with the ability to block attacks. (F you blue shells). 16 player local co-op or online play and a campaign mode. It's cheap but is a bit light on single player content. Multiplayer is good fun, but servers are scarce.All in all I think worth a tenner or so. If you can get a good multiplayer game going it's pretty good fun, assuming the game modifiers are on your side...:Just a bit of rambling with a demo of the game below.

												Obliteracers (Formerly known as Space Dust Racers) is a super unique start to 2016 game development. It features local and online party play, not splitscreen, but the camera expanding to support everyone. It brings back the nostalgic mario-kart feelings to 2016, and multiplies the fun by 4x, quite literally. Even more interesting (the first game I've seen to do this), you can hook up extra controllers, laptops and smartphones/tablets to get the whole family involved. Obliteracers also uses local area network forwarding, which means the smartphone control goes straight to your modem and straight back to your PC. However, the smartphone/tablet controls I feel are a little dodgy and need to be changed to a more simple, 1 joystick style instead of this smart accelerator stuff they've got going at the moment.If you have no friends or your family is deciding to anti-social, the AI is there and good to go. The AI isn't dumb, but sure as hell be a lot better. They tend to not use the power-ups very effectively and make some decisions that isn't exactly clever.The UI is perfect, it is 100% compatible with controllers so you can hook your laptop up to the TV and be all good to go! However, I feel the kart number system is a little confusing at times and lets just say the 16-player online gets really confusing, fun and absolutely MENTAL when you join a full match.To summarise (and some other stuff I'm too lazy to say):Pros:Unique controller systemInsane 16 player party gaming funSeamless UIVariety of mapsTons of gamemodesThat awesome Unreal Engine 4 feelAwesome online multiplayerNo splitscreen, just a single screen for everyone!Humorous and quick music (I know, it sounds weird but it is)Cons:Few servers hosted, said servers not often fullSlightly repetitive career modeNot as many power-ups as I would like8/10 from me, great buy :) "

												Its been a while since I played this game. But all I remember was funny moments and great people. The sad thing about this game is that the Online multiplayer is very small to no-one on. I recommend you Friend listing anyone you play with so you can start a group next time you play to make it just that much more fun.The game modes are varied and extremely enjoyable. Weapon drops and funny characters just add that extra punch too than just racing. Worth id recommend getting it on sale tho , since the player base for online is so low only down side tho :)			"

												Some technical issues at least on my setup. For example, V-Sync does not work properly and instead keeps freezing the graphics. Also, high settings seem to be a bit heavy for my computer and setting them to medium causes weird bugs, such as menus lagging and sometimes disappearing altogether, leaving only background visible. Technical issues aside, the game itself is fun to play and I personally like the use of camera to keep other racers visible when necessary. Playing with a large amount of racers can be pretty chaotic, though.

												A neutral review option would be appreciated now as this game doesn't deserve thumbs down but it does not deserve a positive either. I see a lot of reviewers praise this game as a good couch game. For that purpose it probably is a very good alternative to Mario Kart but for singleplayer or multiplayer over the net i find it very lacking.  so 1 out 3 is not good enough in my opinion for a Positive. Pro's+ Good action+ Polished Graphics+ Fun+ Good couch gameCon's- Multiplayer ovet the net. Lobby exists but it's designed weirdly. Never any servers up and joining games requires the host to wait at the start line until players join. Waiting in the character selection screen for example does not work and actively racing while waiting for others to join does not work either. - Single player campaign missions are fun time wasters for awhile but certain races towards the end are a mess. Mostly the ones involving massive amounts of racers turnging the whole thing into a random mayhem which is not a good thing if you are playing career. So the end verdict is that this is precisely what you want for couch gaming with your friends but other scenarios are such that better alternatives exist on Steam. And not just a few, quite a lot of them actually and they are all better than this.			"

												Like many other kart racers it gets many things right except the most important aspects of the genre: vehicle physics/handling and track design. It seems game developers haven't learned why Mario Kart (any version) is still the best kart racer.Handling of the vehicle is simply awful. Most of the time it seems someone else is driving your vehicle which is a dealbreaker for me. The physics are incoherent and you really have no idea what to expect. In this aspect the game feels like an alpha or early beta.The track design is super repetitive. Other than some style differences all tracks I've played seem pretty much the same.			"

												I don't know why this game is getting such positive feedback. It's a complete mess. 4/10 only because it at least seems to be bug free at the moment. Overall, just another waste of $15. Sonic All-stars Racing remains the only kart racer that is on par with the Mario series. This store page should just redirect users over there.1.There is no camera focus on your own player so you never know where you are.2. No momentum physics built into the game so turns are instant and often times 90* angles. And when you jump, apparently you become a balloon because you'll just float in the air until whatever rules they made bring you floating back down to the track. 3. The weapons are boring and a nuisance to use.4. The races just seem to ""happen"". Meaning there is no real feeling of involvement on the Player's behalf. As if you're just participating in a preprogrammed demo.5. 16 player races? Lol, I would love to see that catastrophic failure unfold. Luckily I don't know 15 other people who wasted their time and money on this slop.Next!			"

												Leuke game. Erg grappig ook. Sfeertje is wat kinderlijk, maar niet irritant. Erg aan te raden voor feestjes. Helaas is online vrijwel uitgestorven, maar daarom moet je hem ook doen met vrienden (lokaal of online kan allebei). Het is niet als Mariokart waar ieder zijn eigen beeld heeft om naar te kijken, maar je deelt hem met de hele groep. Dat maakt echter ook 16player matches mogelijk (al vind ik 8 al wel zat).De Transporter-map vind ik zelf het leukst icm een paar modifiers (zoals gladde ondergrond instellen). Dat maakt het echt een gevecht tegen elkaar en niet zozeer een kwestie van geluk. Beetje psychologische oorlogsvoering is ook niet weg dan.Voor het zachte prijsje is het zeker de moeite waard. Een echte party-game waar je zo een avond mee kan vullen. Hij lijkt ook vrij veel op Mashed (Fully Loaded) en na een paar video's snap je ook wel hoe het speelt.			"

												This is the best top down racer in this style I've played since Micro Machines V3. The physics and weapon system allow for a lot of tactical depth without being overly complex. There's a good sense of speed and the AI is no push over either. But unfortunately, a lot of people never played MM so the review scores suffered. As a result, this title is severely underrated.

												I bought this game because I am a youth pastor and am VERY INTERESTED in multiplayer, shared-screen, party games that can be played on multiple devices (i.e. Jackbox, etc). I absolutely love games I can throw up on a big screen and then have friends / students join with their own phones or tablets. So, you can imagine, I jumped at buying this game, since it advertised itself as just that (but as a racing game)...Boy did it fail... hard...The controls are nightmarish (especially on touchscreen devices). The gameplay design is muddled and hard to follow. The online multiplayer is so terribly NON-user-friendly that by the time you get everyone logged in and selected, no one even wants to play - and when they do, the experience is so aggravating everyone is DONE within the first minute or two.Maybe this game is fun in it's career mode, with a controller, by yourself. But for multiplayer purposes - not worth the time.			"

												Mario Kart meets SpeedRacers!This game is great.  I noticed it months ago and waiting until release and wasn't disappointed.  The game plays like a more chaotic version of Mario Kart where the camera will follow 1st place only.  Once you die, you get to control a rocket launcher to take out the remaining racers.  The fun of this is that you all control it, so you end up fighting with other people for the shots.We spend a lot of time playing and chatting ♥♥♥♥ as this game is perfect to grief your friends and then mock them accordingly.It's generally a fun game that i've not found to get boring yet, and really fun in local co-op too.

												My friends and I are super into couch co-op games. We love Blaze Rush and when I found this, it looked amazing. We lasted about 6 minutes before we were all over this game. The camera is downright terrible, even for trying to get 4 people to race together. I can't imagine trying to fit any more on the screen. The actual car handling is simply awful. The turning felt either far too touchy, or downright unresponsive. This game might be worth it at a $5 price point, but $15 was asking too much. This was my first Steam refund. If this game LOOKS fun, save yourself some time and go check out Blaze Rush instead. It's everything you're probably looking for.			"

												Its not really a race since everyone has a shared screen so all players must be within meters of each other or else you die.  not my cup of tea			"

												While this game has a good variety of tracks, weapons and options, it lacks  a standard race in mulitplayer  (ie first to finish 5 laps) - split screen for local co-op would be great, too.			"

												Decent Kart action.  Would like a little more GP stype but I havn't played much so far.  Maybe there will be some gameplay more like that.  So far from what I have played its a great quick pick up and no need to master pary game.  Will have lots of fun with this one.			"

												Only played it a few minutes, Im not gonna give it a bad review because i haven't played it enough.  I bought the game thinking it was splitscreen, i have 4 xbox 360 controllers and a projector so I thought it'd be fun to play but it's not splitscreen. You can play versus but instead of splitscreen everybody is using same screen and if you set a controller down (not playing) the unmanned car will still follow you just out of the screen and soon as you hit the gas your car will instantly catch up like you were racing the whol time...????. For me it ruins the game cuz it's like a racing game but your not really racing so i don't get the point. Anyways just my opinion.			"

												The point of the single player mode is to prep you for online play.  No one is ever online.  Making the whole game and everything you can unlock only last about 5 hours total.			"

												I agree with another reviewer... I would be very satisfied if I paid 99 cents for it, but definitely not $15.00, which is why I got a refund.			"

												Meh....  A giant meh.  My opinion this game is worth about 99cents. Really not what i was hoping for.  The controls aren't great and the gameplay is extremely repetitive .			"

												Tries to sell itself as Mario Kart - fails miserably.  I'm sure some will like this fun little combat racer - but it ain't me.			"

												THIS GAME IS CRAP!!! I was hoping for a ""Mario Cart' like game. Not slideing around, no camera focus, game that had no form or function. Was like bumper cars with a race attached to it. A friend bought it for me and now I am hoping I can get it refunded for him. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! IT IS CRAP!!!			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I expected it to be like mario kart.The gameplay was so messy and clunky it took like 2 minutes to figure out which character you are controlling, the characters are also lame you can't be human, they are forcing you to be either animals or robots.In conclusion this game gave me the opposite of a boner my ♥♥♥♥♥ went back inside of my body instead of going out :'(.2/10 - 2 Stars for effort.

												I was making researches about a local multiplayer game. And I found it ! This is litteraly Micro Machines V4 but with less tracks/diversity, more players, more deadly weapons, and more chaos.This is a blast to play with friends. Just go for it for playing with friends ! And of course, disable air strikes. :) Although, the solo is kinda short, the difficulty is here.			"
