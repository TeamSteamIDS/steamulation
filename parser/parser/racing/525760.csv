Early Access Review
								It's off to a bad start.I appreciate every bit of VR content that comes my way, but I expect it to be a bit more polished than this,  Took me a bit to get used to the movement, and once I was able to get the hang of it I saw what direction I was supposed to be headed in...  but you are able to just clip through every wall.  There is literally no collision detection or anything, you can just wander through any wall you want.  When I saw finally exceedingly frustrated, I came up to a wall that was clearly telling me to go upwards, I tried to scale it up with my Vive controllers and... it actually works.  The little obsticle courses do work.  But they are far too easy.  The first 10 courses might as well be a budget VR orientation rather than a challenge.  Another problem is that the game is not poorly coded at all.  I mean like, you see a wall with 10 or so spots where you have to hold onto various spots and scale up, but really all you need to do is clip into the wall and just press pretty much any button and you will be on top.  It reduces the initial wall climb down to a tiny setback of 2-3 seconds.  Even if you play it fairly and walk up these walls, some of them make no sense.  Step up 5 balls or whatever, and there's no futher one to grab onto.  There's not even a clear way to complete them fairly.  Basically just clip through them and continue on your way.Pretty much every time, in my experience, when you get to the top of the wall and you have to scale across an area by pulling yourself across a pipe with the controllers, the headset just goes black.  It's so confusing.  It's like done intentionally if you went outside of the bounds or something.  A few pixels too high, as you make each stride, but it's horrible to have your sight go dark for no explainable reason.  Bad overall, as if the developer doesn't have a headset themself to test it out.  Overall, pass on this.  But I will immediately delete this review or turn it to positive once a few patches roll out and the game show a bit more quality.  OR the price drops a bit lower, it seems broken for $8 canadian but for $2-3 it might be acceptable for a project under active development.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a little rough, but I think it's fun. There's a leader board for each course, but that seems buggy too. A guy with a faster time was underneath my time. I think the obstacles and grips work well. I'm a climber, and I feel like it approximates it well. You can switch between single and matching (both hands on one grip) holds. Locomotion is done by holding down the grips and swinging your arms back and forth. Holding one grip is normal speed, and holding two grips is fast speed. There are clipping issues, and the black countdown screen at the beginning of each course gets in your way, making it hard to see the start of each course, until you get past the screen, but it's usually right next to a wall, so you tend to get past the screen and then clip into the wall, unless you're careful with your arm swings.EDIT: They fixed the black countdown screen and scoreboard issues. Most clipping issues might have been fixed too. You can walk into a tall column and then end up on top of it out of nowhere though. Jumping from vertical pole to pole is very difficult. Maybe, some of the grips/poles need larger grabable areas.			"

								This is my favorite game right now, best replayability in VR for me so far, up there with Windlands.			"

								This game could be good, but it needs a fair bit of work to make this ""that"" good.1: It is not kid friendly. Kids do not have 6 foot arm span, and cannot reach the grips never mind reach across and up.2: It needs better collision detection. climbing through a wall is frustrating enough without the hmd going black for a few seconds and then falling because you thought it crashed.3: Music.  People, add some energetic music to get the adrenalin going because at the moment, it is plain boring.4: sort out the leaderboard.  I'm all for being the most useless person to play, but I refuse to believe a course that would take a very very quick person a minimum of 15 seconds to complete... has a leaderboard score of 2 seconds????  No way, not even if you could fly through it, someone cheated, or there is a glitch.  I know it sounds like I'm ripping the game to pieces, but this really has the base work to be brilliant.  It just hasn't been done yet.  Devs, have a quick look at dorito challenge on xbox 360 to get an idea of adrenalin music, and colission detection.    I'm going to keep coming back to this, as it's fun to play if you work around the bugs, and i also want this to be fantastic as it can potentially be!			"

Early Access Review
								TBH I havent read the full spec on early access, but my take is that its about buying the game early, helping fund and influence the developers, and seeing if you like the game enough to stick with it. If Steam allows a refund if you really hate the way it is or is going, then that seems great to me,  and the review during early access should be about the idea, main gameplay and major control systems.So, with that in mind, I think this game has huge potential for Vive users, is a great idea, is well implemented, and has some bugs, like clipping etc, which is why its early access and not finished, I believe.So as an early access game I think its worth buying, if you dont get nausius from the gameplay, and like the idea of a Wipeout style game.The courses could be placed in locations I would hope, like above a shark infested water tank perhaps? It could be made to resemble a game show, like in RUNNING MAN or something too, or even made like FIFA with commentary to be like the total Wipeout TV show. Real potential I think, little rough, but that is to be expected, right?Not refunding this one, but have many others,			"
