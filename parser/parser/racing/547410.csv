												After watching the ""GTR-35 Tandem"" trailer that is clearly advertising multiplayer capabilities, I bought this game for myself and two friends. You can only imagine my disappointment to realize that there is NO real time multiplayer. Feeling 100% ripped off and wouldn't recommend this game to anyone wanting to play with friends or a crew.

												This was a good game. Good physics, visuals were decent, and the customization was good enough. So, how do you ♥♥♥♥ it up? I'll tell you, They took nearly all the cars, removed the ingame money, then hid them all behind a dlc wall. Not only that but the packs are WAY too over priced for what you get. If it was 5 to 4 dollars i could live with it but 9 to 7 for packs that add 3 to 4 cars is a rip off. Your better off saving your money for something else. Shame as this game had potential then they just let greed take over development and now we get this.UPDATE 3/4/2017Boy how money hungry are they? Not only are they making the dlc packs over priced but now there is a deluxe edition? Lol what? Alright then gather around everyone we are going to do a bit of math.They have reduced the price to 9 dollars for the base game. Then we have 4 dlcs, all over priced as they give nothing that would demand the price they are at now. With tax and such its 10+9+7+6+5. That equals 37 dollars for base game and all dlc separately. All together with the scam pack and its 23 dollars. This is still a giant rip off. For both prices your still getting next to nothing for content, drift phyics from what feels like a game from 2005, mediocre graphics and sound effects and zero online gameplay(Sorry peak angle ghosts of players on the track with you doesn't count as multiplayer). Your better off buying assetto corsa with the japan car pack then modding it. Sure it may be more expensive but trust me you will get far more enjoyment from that then this.			"

												""Peak Angle: Drift Online is a real-time massively multiplayer online (MMO) simulator for PCs running on Windows platform. The concept of the game is based on drifting competitions in Player vs Player mode.""Firstly, it's not an MMO at all. It's not even actually online. It's ghost mode with the scores being listed. This actually isn't so bad, but the fact they're using false advertising is wrong.Secondly, I paid for the game but now they've decided I didn't pay enough and added another $20 to get all the content. I thought for $10 the content was pretty thin, but for $30 after taking the content away from me and trying to charge me double what I already paid??!!? YOU CAN GO SUCK A F!@#!Attempting refund based on False advertising.The game was great when I bought it for $10 for the whole game but now it's not only overpriced but the devs have shown their true colours and I ain't supporting that.

												A pretty cool little time waster. Of course sometimes you'd want to waste 20-30 minutes and accidentally waste an hour and a half, but it's not a game you can just binge play. In any case, the physics are simple enough, the game countersteers for you. It's  a simple to learn, difficult to master type deal. For physics download the demo it'll tell you everything you need to know. Note - not all cars have changeable bodykits, not all bodykits can be bought with in game currency (which is VERY difficult to win in daily challenges). Same goes for wings and wheels. On that note it's not pay to win. The multiplayer aspect is... well as far as I figured it out you play against ghost replays of other people online, which is a good way to exclude lobbies, lag, griefing, and many proper online problems. On the other hand it's not really online, but I do not care much about that. All in all is it worth 12 eur? Well, you decide, at first I thought not, then I got into it and I thought ""yes, probably it will be a good value for money, since it will bring a ton of playtime over time""			"

												Any other PC drifting games with low-to-med spec requirements?I don't think so.Pros:+ Very nice drifting physics+ Quite a lot of cars, many still in development though+ Not Pay2win+ Vinyl system encourages creativity and allows you to replicate real life liveries (although with fictional aftermarket logos)+ You compete against other people's ghost record = no lag, no sync error, you can pause mid-match+ Money farming isn't tedious and slow+ Car customization: body kits, rims, spoilers, vinyls and decals+ Fine tuning option is one of the best and most complete among lots of racing games.+ Perfect for both casual drift players and hardcore drift enthusiasts+ You can play this using keyboard (now, think about how many drifting games impossible to play on keyboard.. and then there's Peak Angle, which is comfy on keyboard!)Cons:- You compete against other people's ghost record = not 100% multiplayer, but hey, I'll still take it- No car performance downgrade feature (yet).- Many of the cars still don't have customizable body kits (many visual models are still in development, so this makes sense).Controversial topic:The developers have recently decided to put three-quarter of the total car amount into DLCs. Now, before everyone goes crazy, I'd like to inform that all players who have accumulated over 500.000 Credits (Cr) at any point of their gameplay get free access to all DLCs; they can buy the cars in-game without having to purchase the DLCs.On the other hand, new players who buy the game after the DLC update are left with only 7 cars. Although this game is not pay-to-win at all, this renders all newer players unable to collect cars without buying DLCs.However, are the DLCs worth the money? While most people will answer ""No"", I leave the answer to all of you. One DLC contains 2 to 4 cars, some even with a body-kit set unlock. Surely, if a player likes the content of a DLC, they will definitely buy it. But, with the price of the DLCs right now? I can say that most people will choose other games, and I agree. However, this is due to the fact that many of the game's cars are still in development. Therefore, I can conclude that this DLC implementation is rather too early as the game itself still doesn't have enough cars.Conclusion:A perfect drift game for both casual and drift enthusiasts. Although the game is still in development, it is really good in terms of physics and customization. If you don't have a really beefy PC but want a nice and non-demanding drifting game, you should really consider picking this one up.NOTE:After the Version 205 update, the game connection might've been bugged a bit. At the moment, players might experience an issue in profile saving.However, FEAR NOT! The devs are the kind that listen to the players! They're active on the forum and take suggestions, as well as answer players' questions. Additionally, they always try to provide solutions to players' problems.			"

  Peak Angle: Drift Online DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.Peak Angle: Drift Online is a pseudo-online multiplayer racing game. The title is unique as in it's not a conventional sort of car race. The challenge of the game is not to get from point ""A"" to point ""B"" the fastest, but instead; who can accumulate the most ""drift points"" or score within the allotted amount of time. In this regard the game feels more arcade-y. The game is online only, though the opponents appear to be ghosts of real players completing their own runs on the same map. This also makes it so collisions between vehicles are not possible. The game is recommended to be played with the steering wheel controller, though using the keyboard or a game pad also work.-------- Graphics: 7 / 10  The graphic assets of the game are quite good. Bigger racing titles do have a bit more polish to their graphical fidelity though considering this is a small title by a small studio, the 3D models are decent for what they are. The game's physics and movement of the cars are very standard. Again, not as  defined as other titles, but it does get the job done. There are quite a bit of visual customization options within the game and a decent amount of playable cars. All cars are based off of real-world models, although named differently. In addition to this, there are a good amount of maps to race on albeit they all look somewhat generic. The game is surprisingly not that demanding and should run fine on any lower tier - mid tier CPU and graphics card. Playing around with the graphical options is also recommended as the default settings may not be suitable for all setups. -------- Sound: 6 / 10 The sound and music assets are all very generic. That being said, the game does a good job with it's soundtrack. The themes are all fast-paced and blood-pumping tracks, which is what is to be expected from a title like this. The car noises are not too far off from sounding authentic and all the audio within the game does get annoying or tiresome after long game sessions. -------- Mechanics: 6 / 10 The game's mechanics are solid and the concept is quite simple. The player will choose their car and navigate through a stage with other players' ghost's, to compete for the highest score. Score is obtained by drifting. The longer and more frequent the player drifts, the higher their score will be. Points will not be counted if the player hits a wall or environmental hazard while drifting. In terms of upgrading and customization, the player can buy upgrades and new cars. Upgrades can increase horse power, steering power, and other handling options. In game currency is earned by taking part in matches. The game also has various tuning options for cars which can be accessed in the car options menu. -------- Personal Final Remarks: The game is has a unique but simple concept, and I've never played a racing game in which the ""race"" was to accumulate more points than the other players. I feel like the ghost multiplayer is sort of a double edged sword; there will always be a match ready for you, but you may never have the experience of REALLY playing with other people. Though considering that the player count of the game is low, this may have been the right move for the development team. Maybe sometime in the future they will be able to implement true multiplayer. I feel like people who don't take racing games too seriously, and those who would enjoy a casual ""drifting"" game, would also enjoy this title. I personally couldn't find my bearing with the game's controls though that's more of a personal gripe gather than one with the game's actual controls.  Thanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.			"

												Bought this before it was on steam, at the time there were 6 premium cars you could only buy for real money (and the 10$ you payed for the game would give you enought credits to buy 2 of them), now out of the 26 cars in the game 7 are available without dlc. Devs turned really greedy real quick. MMO it is not. There is no massive open world as one would expect (hell not even ubisoft is arrogant enough to claim the crew is mmo and it comes closer to one) but 5 min races with UP TO 3 other ghosts (that are not even in the same instance, ie recorded)			"

												Started playing this game as Freeware, instantly donated more than enough Money to get a permanent Account. I did that because i liked the Idea behind the Game, even though there wasn't a lot of content available back then. After the transition to Steam, things got bad. Most of the Cars which were available for Free are now Hidden behind a Paywall to rip off the Players. Content, which was available through in game progress and Money is now excluded , so the Dev gets more Money. The Game has already 4!!!!! DLC available, but no localization whatsoever, besides Russian and English. NO REAL MULTIPLAYER, only a few small Maps and Tracks, a lot of Content still missing. This Game basically converted to a rip-off machine - and i bet this will kill it completely. Bad move, dev! As a Content Developer for OMSI, i released a DLC for OMSI, too. i know that especially car models are a lot of work and i would pay for them, if they had a fair price and if they were NEW - but in this case, its only a ♥♥♥♥ing rip-off.i would highly suggest saving your money on this Game. It isn't worth it anymore. If bought this game with a promise to get all the missing stuff, now i got a game with a bit different physics, less content but the ability to spend more money on some new Cars. Sorry, i won't purchase anything else and if i could, i would refund the whole Game.			"

												I was sceptic about this game at first (mainly because of the developers' country of origin, but let's not focus on that), but as I tried the demo, it blew my mind. It was so good to drift with my x360 controller that I became a real fan. The cars are well modeled and tuning (visual&engine etc) is great in this game. In the fine tuning section you have more options than you have in Forza Motorsport. The drifting handling physics are very good, as for an arcade racing game. The music of this game also got my approval sticker.Yet it still has some downsides, which are hopefully fixed in order to make this game even better. The gravity seems to be out of place, if your car lifts from the ground, it feels like you're in moon, and the car easily flips because of that. Also not all the cars are finished yet.A BIG ++++ to this game for having a FREE 48-HOUR DEMO, which gives you a taste of things to come.TL;DR: Try the demo and see for yourself.			"

												I have put about 80+ hours into this game before its steam release and I have to say it's fantastic. I haven't bought all the cars yet but the four I have (MK2, S13, GT86 and of course the Hachi-Roku) are all different in their handling and drift style/physics. There are three main game modesA quick race mode where you can select your track and if the other players are same the league (license) or free for all (no limits on league or car spec) and one for cars of similar spec. This is where you get your rating up, to gain higher leagues/licenses (you also earn money and experience)Then there is the global championship where you bring your own ride to the party. The course for the championship changes each day and there is a ranking system where the top 5 each day win credits. (I have managed a 4th and a 5th in my time in game so far woot hehe) Also there are daily events which give you a predefined tuned car (that you can't tune or fiddle with yourself so we are all on an equal playing field bar skill) so you do get to try a lot of the cars before buying them. There is also a ranking system in this mode where the top 5 get credits too.You don't earn rating points in the championship and event modes but you do make good money and experience. And there is a practice mode for getting your tuning sorted and learning tracks or trying new lines.The livery system is good and there is a nice selection of body kits (for non premium cars), spoilers, exhausts, rims and paint options. The tuning system is top notch and very tweak able.The game itself runs fantastically on my system (i7 950, 12gb ram, gtx970) at 2560x1440 DSR, max settings and AA, with the only issue being stupid high frame rate when loading the game and maps that leads to coil whine. (vsync or frame limiting fixes that though) The only bad I can come up with is that all the car models aren't in game yet and the multiplayer isn't yet proper PvP. But these are coming so I'm not to fussed about it.All in all if you like drifting this game is bloody awesome. It has even pulled me away from The Crew Wild Run which is quite a feat, well done guys!!.

												🌟 Review 4u and KDBAn complete and challenging drift simulator.GameplayI'm impressed with everything that Peak Angle offers, due to the small size it occupies on the disc. Like every simulator has a certain level of difficulty, which makes it even better. Your objective is to make most drifts in a short time. The drift time also counts. The tracks are long and full of paths, giving several possibilities of drift. I felt more comfortable playing through the keyboard arrows, however the game has partial compatibility with gamepad. The online mode pleased me a lot too, it doesn't take much time to find open matches and during the ""races"" I had no problems with lag at all.Another awesome point of the game is the customization system. Impressive variety of items that can be modified, from the texture, to the hue of colors. You can make your own decals, with a huge library of shapes and objects. And the best, you can save your decals and share with other players.GraphicBeautiful and incredibly slight. Runs easily in any current setup. The most impressive are the cars detailing.SoundtrackOriginal, fast and energic. Boost you during the game.Rate: 10/10One of the most impressive ''race'' games I played till now. Has a complex and realistic drift system. An complete customization system and multiplayer system works perfectly.			"

Still a good arcade drifter.Its a mix betwen forza horizon and Drift street japan ish. I give it 6/10, because there is no PVP or custom lobbys with colisoin yet. Other than that its fun!

There are a lot of cars, and within every update there is more! I usually get a car, max the upgrades and then after the update get a new one, and max it out as well. That way i allways try some new cars. Love the new bonus points system, becouse its something new to the game and i m also waiting for that put up for sale option, or designs from other players.Right now i m rocking DRX-7 1999, after the DRX-8.P.S would be cool to gets some body kit upgrades on premium cars.

												The game is great, very addictive, If you love cars, car games, drift - Try it! Peak Angle is realistic, but not hard for novices in car games. Also, the game have very nice graphics and extensive system of tuning/personalization. Game is incessantly supported by developers, regularly appear new updates.   "

												This game was great before the release on Steam, I loved playing the trial and am glad that they released it on Steam. The game in my opinion has great physics and lots of customization, great for killing time or just need to relax from another game. I loved the trial so decided to buy the game on Steam with no hesitation and I am not regreting my decision at all. This game has lots of replayability since you can buy different cars and upgrade them to your liking. I can already see myself playing this for hours on end. I have been waiting for this game to come out forever and thankfully the game has finally released on Steam since I didn't have money to buy it on the website. Pros:- Vast Customization- Endless Replayability- Amazing Cars- Fun Multiplayer- Smooth GameplayCons:- Same Car Sounds- Laggy Menu Screen (Might Just Be My Computer)- Needs More Tracks- Player BattlesI hope that soon the developers will update the game and make it amazing, keep up the good work!Username: NexusID: 586			"

												Ive put 25 hours into this game. This is NOT a simulation by anymeans, however if your not too worried about realistic physics it is great to just enjoy the slide. I use an xbox one elite controller and programmed button configs very easily. I would however like to say the sounds and music get very repetitive, the skid marks never change tone or pitch, and are so loud that i had to adjust them a little to hear the engine more. I did this and then realized the cars do not sound great, but is a great start to better sounds in the game. On a side note, is it just me or is there no turbo or supercharger sounds? as i cannot hear them whatsoever. The cars sound a little like same clip of a V8 with pitch and tone changes for each car. I would love to see modding support for sounds and cars down the line. This title does seem addictive with what it has already. If the peak angle team listens to the community and keeps providing new cars and solid updates like they've been, it will be a solid arcade drifter. I cannot stress the word ARCADE enough.			"

												EPIC game, and a great transition to Steam!As a player who had played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game before it was on steam i still like it just as much if not more with the new clipping point ""Poles"".Would absolutely recommend this game to my friends, as its a really fun, pretty cheap drifting game which nailed the customization.Personally i would LOVE to see some ""Wall Tap"" mechanic implemented into the game which rewards you to actually TAP the wall pretty lightly, as i have had multiple cases where i went so close to the wall that i lightly brushed it and lost 60K+Also i would really love to see some new maps in the game, as ive pretty much layed rubber on every mm of these tracks!Cant wait to see the upcoming car bodies and ALL the other upcoming things!I just had the first error i EVER had, (Runtime error has requested a exceptional terminate command or something idk).However normally it runs super stable and loading times have improved from the start. :DA SOLID 9/11			"

												I'm recomending this because the gameplay is there, but the game...hopefully will get there at some point. First the bad: This game is not complete and should have been released under Early Access. Feature incomplete games should never be marketted as full releases. This is just my opinion.Supported graphics lists a minimum of a GT 430 - but Intel HD4000-5000 in the supported chipsets. Based on this I expected decent performance on low out of an AMD A10-7300 R6 equipped APU, which is comparable to the Intel 4000-5000 and often superior. I did not get it. The game performs at 15-25fps on low settings. This is disapointing, since it really shouldn't. That aside, the gameplay is fine. It's a nice arcade drifting game. The progression could probably use a little more balancing but it's not that bad. I don't like the car research/buy system or multiple currency cancer from mobile centric gamedesign but it's not a dealbreaker since the game is actually FUN to play. And based on it being FUN to play I have to reccomend it. But if you expect 60fps on a potato, you're not going to get it. Hopefully a better graphics setting menu or optimization is coming in the future to give some merit to the claimed IGP support. Still... probably the best drifting MMO going at the moment. Has a super sexy S13 knock-off model that will probably take eight million hours to unlock ;-;			"

												Peak angle drift online is in my opinion the best substitute for not owning forza. i think that the mechanics in this game and the way that the cars are made and are able to be tuned without having to purchase anything makes it a really good game, ive already got a r34 fully upgraded and it is amazing, what i dont understand though is i have all the dlc and it is telling me if i want to buy some of the cars that i want i have to go buy the dlc again, ive already emailed support about this issue and would like it to be fixed, but anyways its an amazing game, 10/10 would legitimately recommend.

												The game had a good start before making it to steam.When you put all the fun you have while drifting on this game on the side. What you see is money grab.They were selling the game before it made to steam, then they somehow get it on steam and now they did not give a update since it came to steam. Why sell your game then put on steam. I need my money back ♥♥♥♥Oh and also dont listen to what most of the people wrote in their review most dont have a clue what they talk about when it comes to the mechanics of the game. Also it is a pay2win game :) There are things that without paying you cant get + at first you have to pay money to even play it.			"

												So at first, I figured to give this game a spin since it was free for the first 48 hours. Within an hour of playing it, I was hooked and bought the game right off the bat. This game is super fun to play if you are into drifting, there more pros than cons. I've been playing this game for the past almost 4 monthts and been dying for it to get released on Steam. It finally did today! I'd even order a new red ps4 controller just to play this game. Not once have I ever spent such an amount of money on an item to use it on one game. Pros:Awesome CarsIsn't cheaply put togetherGraphics looks super awesomeGame is getting updated quite oftenGetting sideways is pretty easy and controllable once you learn how the car handlesEach car handles differentlyCons:No unique engine soundsNot all the car models are avalible yet No true pvp battles yet No Point A to Point B tracksI hope the creators comes out some awesome point A to point B tracks, along with each car with its own unique sounds/noises (Exhaust tones, BOV, Wastegates, so forth)I can go on and on why you should get this game, but if you are a true gear head and love drifting. For the price of the game, you can not beat it. Username: Sleepy ID:97459			"

I thought about it for a week or so but then I just had to buy it to get back drifting and I have not regretted it.Pros:-Great physics and car handling-Nice graphics-NIce selection of customizable and tunable cars-Many maps-Multiplayer support-Livery creator-Easy to play with keyboard-Most controllers supportedCons:-No interior or bonnet/bumper cam-Some features still in developmentI really like the game and would totally recommend it!

												DRIFT!!!!!!!!! You hear the tires squling as you go around the corner. The white cloud.... Love it. Peak Angle is what it is. It is a game about drifting. Now that might not seem intresting but before you click of this I would Like to say this. This game is not easy. It takes some time to get used to it. I don't know how hard it is for a keyboard because I don't use that I use a wheel, but even with that it still is not easy. And thats something else good about this game. They don't make it really easy to just jop into a car and get sidways. It takes some time and you can't get it overnight. But this game is not perfect. One fault that they need to change right away is that when you hit  wall ever so slighly you lose your points which is really anoying. Also if you not willing to spend money on DLC.. well then your RIP. I would recomend getting the best version that is around 23 bucks.... Not that it matters because it takes some time before you can get those cars due to the experince going up ever so slowly. But other than that I would recomend this game to everone especially if you want a challange, want to drift, and drift some truly amazing cars.So what are you wating for. GET DRIFTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Got an email telling me to write and objective review for DLC free forever.I loved this game, but all this pay wall stuff for cars is a joke for what was a great free game. Only reason I ever bought a key when I first played the origianl release well before steam was because it was great and new ""pay for the game to unlock it from the timed trial period"" Did that and got the game and was damn happy with it. Now that I've done that I got it on steam because I originally purchased credits to own the game, now i'm told to write this to get the free-gone-pay2play content. So this is my objective review. Pay us for the game, now that you've got the game and unlocked a decent amount of cars and updrages stuff lets lock it away so you either write a review for us or pay us. Great game..			"

												Finally it's up on steam. Peak Angle is a very fun game to play with if you love drifting  or doing tandem. Also, you can customize you ride in your own style. Paint it and place stickers and such. The physics.... you may feel a bit weird at first but that's something you just need to get used to i guess. The graphic is not impressive, it's good enough tho. The good thing is you don't need to have a high-end PC to run it smoothy. Well, at least i don't have an insanely good PC but still running prefectly. There are lot more features and things in this game. I can't write everything down here sadly. But if you feel like this is your kind of game. I highly recommend you to check this out. Also, please notice that this game is still under development so there's many cars still haven't finished modeling and quite a lot of features is still not functional. Just keep that in mind. Oh btw.

												Have many many more hours than on steam, since this has only just arrived to the Steam platform.Great game for drifting and is loads of fun. Does have the option to buy addtional content but its seriously no important. The mechanics are simple and are rewarding once mastered.Can't wait to see what the devs bring out in the future with this title.			"

												Regular track racing is what I am most familiar with. GT, Indy and Oval is what I consider regular. There is only one professional grade simulation solution when it comes to regular racing. Difting now has a professional level simulator. Peak Angle is for those that want to drif and only drift. With either a controller or steering wheel (I know keyboard works but have not tried it) You can slide around varous circuits across the globe. Do not judge this by my video below. I did not know what I was doing. Since that video I have gotten better at this and that has translated to other non-drift focused titles. There is a different side to Peak Angle that I find almost as much fun as drifting. That is making the car look the way I want it to look. If You have the time and the creativity, You can make a almost any vector graphic in full color on Your vehicle. I had neither so there is just preset text on 2 of my cars. I recommend this to everyone who has drifted on purpose in their current racing title(s) of choice. Have You ever wondered why some people have wheels that poke out at the bottom of a car that looks too stiff and low to drive? Peak Angle will explain it. Do You know the difference between drifting and getting sideways? Here is a hint: Some of us can drift in a straight line while using the driver (or passenger) door to see straight ahead. Peak Angle. You will learn not only about drifting but about setting up the car to handle/perform accrding to your tastes. Do You wrench on Your tuner in real life? Why not test some setups in here before you go burn the clutch in that RX7 you just modified for competition? Do You just want to enjoy a few slides without the reckless driving ticket? I recommend this to anyone looking for fun behind the wheel. video link below

												Let's start off somewhere the game is a nice Drifting game playing this since before the steam release.The game itself offer you all you need to compete other.The online drift mode is against user replay and the competition mode is the live online drifting mode but the game has a lack of social feature such as a online practice lobby with chat on or/and A main chat room when you'r at your garage so there is no way to call some guys for a live comp.The devs are not really communicating to the english community except for the news which I find it a bit bad.For sure this is a work in progress Lots of feature will comes later on till then we have something pretty much feeling like single player game.Should you buy it I'd say yes if your interested in a drifting game that play well with a controller it's still a beta and a lot can change but the game offer a tons of fun if you can get some friends to drift with you its even better.I'll be steaming a bit of championship drift and explaning the game option soon.Pros:-Good Prices-Great physic for Controllers-Some Fun and a huge Challenge trying to learn all map and find the best drift line to get the most points in the short 5 minutes.Cons:-toomany cars are Now in DLC ""for some of you may not like it"" but was with microtransaction before to get some of those.-Lack of ingame Social option such has a lobby chat so you can see who's online and looking for drifting.-Navigating in the menu with a controller is a total pain in the A..

												Not online AND CERTAINLY NOT AN MMO. No collision with other players whatsoever. When you quit the game from the main menu the game asks you if you'd like to quit or buy credits for their cash shop.No thanks, I am not spending £9 on a unfinished product that is falsely advertised and already has a cash shop in it.Oh and if you're wondering the physics are standard arcade like, no simulation or realism, it's the same as hundreds of others ""drift"" games of the last ten years that you can play for free on andriod or in a browser.

												Oh god where to start. Firstly, why the ♥♥♥♥ would you not have mouse control in the menus? doing anything in the menus of this game is on the verge of physically painful. Moving on, the game already fails as a sim on three key points. The lack of cockpit view, the lack of TrackIR support, and the extremely arcadey car handling. The game is very in-depth with its customization, but it hides micro transaction behind the paid entry. I don't know how easy it is to make the currency through gameplay, but the fact that there's micro transactions while also asking for an upfront fee, already puts me off.It also gave my PC an aneurysm, locking everything at 100% and bringing it dangerously close to overheat protection, even though my specs are well within recommended.TLDR - Not actually a sim, and trying to use the menus makes me want to drink bleach.

												Pros:- Livery editor, pretty decent one too if you could chose not to place stickers over windows.Cons:- Badly optimized. Runs almost as badly as Forza Horizon 3 even though it looks like something someone made in a weekend.- Cars drive like they are on rails, drifting feels extremely forced.- Microtransactions up the a**, even though it's a paid game, and in Early Access.- Horrible interface. I don't know what they were aiming for, but it's certainly not user friendliness.- No car damage, cosmetic or otherwise, even though it doesn't feature licensed cars.- Customization consists of a few mainstream bodykits like Rocket Bunny, removed components, exposed radiators, stretched tires, roof decorations and pretty much everything thats' wrong with street car culture nowadays.- Extremely small and extemely dull tracks.- Soundtrack consisting of trap, dubstep and whatever else they call bad music nowadays.

												absolutely great game. would recommend to anyone who likes any kind of driving games. few gripes though, theres one glitch that doesnt let the game open on a second monitor( even when its set to primary) which is a problem for me because my first monitor is 1/3 of the size of my second. and my 2nd gripe is that the in game currency ""free experience"" (which is the only way to unlock new cars besides the basic first four) is so impossibly hard to earn that it would take days of in game work to unlock your first car. for reference, each match lasts 5 minutes, and if you are lucky you might get 10 free experience (often its half that) the cheapest car in the game costs about 500 free experience and some of the higher end cars are double that. overall this is a fantastic game and id recommend that you pick it up before the game developer realizes its worth more than 10 dollars.

												so good game! love it, it's realistic and has insane cars and such, the game is not finished yet, so i can't wait to see the final edition! but also, i hope more body kits will come in the future, because some of the cars are straight out ugly when they don't have any front... i also hope there will be more focus on tracks, because i want bigger tracks so it is easier to do high speed drifts and more tracks so ican have more variation. thumbs up, fantastic game (Y)👍🏼			"

												Update 4-3-2017I have to change my recommendation. It's not really that great of a game once you realize it's not actually online. As other people have stated, it's not ""real-time"" multiplayer at all. You're racing replays.Original ReviewPlease ignore the 8 minute play time. I had my fair share of play time when it was free to play from their website. I played until it didn't let me anymore.Add support for multiple controllers. My pedals, wheel and gear shifter are all separete controllers. The game is fun but if you have a setup that isn't one single piece, you won't be able to play. It doesn't even recognize my wheel. It only recognizes my pedals. I have a Microsoft Sidewinder FFB Wheel. Yes it's an older wheel, but I paid ten bucks for it and it works like a champ with every other racing game I own.My pedals and shifter are both Thrustmaster. I plan on getting a wheel so I can just plug in one controller but I still feel like it should be pretty easy to detect all the controllers and just let the user map from whatever controller they want. Several other racing games support this and it would be extremely helpful to a lot of people.Another pretty big gripe I have is that you always ask if we want to buy credits when we try to close the game? I just bought this game. It's not f2p yet you still try to run it like one. STOP. It's going to put a sour taste in everybody's mouth if you continue to shove this micro-transaction nonsense down our throats.I hesitantly click the recommend button for this one. Only because the underlying game mechanics are smooth and enjoyable and if you are a keyboard or gamepad user then you'll probably really like this game. If you don't have a single controller for all your sim-driving needs, you'll be disappointed like me. When they add support for multiple controllers, I'll be entirely happy with this game.			"

												Changed it. This is NOT A GOOD GAME ANYMORE. They ruined it with DLC which I can honestly buy but I will not, I worked for my cars, now they've been taken. Greedy owners killed this game, don't get it.			"

												Owned it before it was on steam, is fun. worth 15 bucks? yeah i suppose. its not really online and thats my only dealbreaker with this game. they impliment that and throw in more tracks and finish the cars already in place. it'd be worth 30. no joke. great game other than that.			"

												Peak Angle is a ""multiplayer"" drifting game, where you customize your car and go drifting around tracks with it.I have to say, this is probably the best drifting game on steam at the time of writing this review. Although, that's not the hardest title to earn, considering Drift Streets Japan is abandoned and all the other ones are mostly just F2Ps.Pros:-The handling is nice for a keyboard, although I wish there was a way to turn off the steering assist, at least I haven't found a way.-The customization is barely a pro, but it has a livery editor and a couple different body mods (Wheels, Exhaust, Spoiler, and a couple aesthetic pieces).-There are a nice selection of tracks, in three different environments (Japan, America, and Europe).-The scoring system is nice, you need to tap posts placed in corners to increase your combo.-The graphics are OK, would like to see a little more color (ex. a blue sky), but it runs smooth 1080p 60fps on my GTX 1060 3GB.Cons:-Cars that were previously free to everybody were locked behind DLC, and DLC is a big no-no for me for incomplete games, and what you get isn't even worth the price IMO.-The ""real-time massively mulitplayer online"" statement is a straight up lie, there is no realtime multiplayer nor is it an MMO. It is entirely singleplayer with ghosts as other players.-Several cars have no models in game.-There are no proper Japanese mountain Touge courses, just circuits.-The loading seems a little long for loading a small drift course, but that doesn't bother me too much.Final Word:I would recommend this game to any drift enthusiast, but I honestly wouldn't trust a lot of what the devs are saying. You know that they lied about it being real-time multiplayer, so you never know what else they could be lying about regarding future content. Otherwise, it's a fun game to pass time with, just as long as you don't mind playing a game with unfinished content and quite a bit of overpriced DLC.			"

												Coming back to edit this review and change it from positive to negative. Not only is it not real multiplayer, but now you have to buy DLC to buy cars. Without DLC, the game is already severely incomplete with nearly half the ""promised"" cars missing. The handling is fun and arcady and it's a fun game to play, but $9 just to buy another car is awful for a game that's hardly worth $9 to begin with. DO NOT BUY			"

												i love this game and dont know why there is so many bad reviews put on it. i feel the game could be improved a hole lot by including mod support also allowing people to  gain money easier (if choose to). It would mean having fun with the more expensive cars. other than the few ideas i have the game is fun and if you enjoy using wheel its all the more fun but very easy to drift with a controller as i use both g27 and xbox controller			"
