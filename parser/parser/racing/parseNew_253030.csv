												In some ways, this game is the perfect metaphor for our lives. Each of us is the little spacecraft and we chase after the light of our dreams. There will be several paths for us to try out on our journey, with the shadow of our doubts slowing us down if we let it. We will inevitably crash and burn many... many times into obstacles that came out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and there will be that one stage that will seem impossible. However, if we have the courage to press that 'retry' button, then eventually we will beat the game. Just remember to never lose sight of your dream, and don't let the sun set on you before you get to the end. Praise the sun. 10/10			"

												It's like a crazy minimalist hybrid of Star Fox/F-Zero crossed with Super Hexagon's speed and reflex driven twitch aspects.  My only real complaints are the bugs at the moment with achievements and some other stuff.  I liked the older leaderboard stle they had in previous versions, and the soundtrack could be a lot better and perfect the experience.  Overall, great game and I'd highly recommend it if you're into this sort of thing.  Has great level editing tools as well as what will be a great user-created level portal.  I'm not a fan of ""luck-based"" procedural generated levels but hopefully that can be eliminated by user-created levels at some point.  I'd also like a static leaderboard alongside the daily leaderboard, for best players overall.  And hopefully in time all of this can be worked out in some way.  But yeah, go buy it, one of the best indie titles to release on Steam recently and worth the time and money.			"

												This game is so addictive. How addicitive you ask? So addictive that you will keep saying ""one more go"" after smashing against a wall.Race The Sun reminds me of an old flash game that I used to play in College years ago, it was called Tunnel Maze Game and your objective was to dodge and jump obstacles that popped up at you, giving you a split second to react while your character surfed within a tunnel. If you know the game I am talking about then you will enjoy this game.Gameplay wise, not every retry will be the same, meaning you could initially learn a portion of a region and then next try find yourself going a completely different way or into another area. The great thing about this game though is that the world will change every 24 hours, meaning it is forever changing. Not only that but it is user content friendly, meaning you can create and publish your own worlds for others to try.Overall, if you are into games that test your reflexes or you have that determination to try and get a better score or do better than the last try. This game is for you.			"

												This game reminds me of Rez for Dreamcast, but the cool thing is that you have freedom to go where ever you please in the level, just don’t run into anything. After dying by hitting objects in the level you want to play some more so that you can get to the next level. The faster you go the sun actually goes up the sky instead of down.  This game is fun and nerve bending at the same time. I recommend this game for those who like challenging fast pace games that keep you on the edge of your seat.			"

Race the Sun is an impressive test of your reflexes & concentration skills reminiscent of classic forward-scrolling 3D shooters like Star Fox. Before the sun disappears, your solar craft must make it as far as possible without hitting anything. At the same time, trying to stay in the light & grab as many power-ups, tris or wormholes across the landscape, to boost you along as fast as possible. There's a fantastic sense of speed building up the longer you survive, often flying past objects so close you could touch it (and sometimes mistakenly do lol!).Lighting effects of the sun streaming rays of light through the various shapes of the artifically inspired worlds looks awesome, while also being a key mechanic functionally in the game design!The world is randomly regenerated every 24hrs to provide new challenging combinations, plus in-between there is plenty of community maps to try on the Workshop. There are also specific challenges to level-up & upgrade your default craft to work towards longer term.  Some of these are really hard!Great to play on the big screen (in your lounge room), for a brief daily distraction (since games can be very quick indeed sometimes) :) or even a longer session where you reach for the clouds & conquer your (or friends) high scores! There are some tough achievements & a game plus mode for the hardcore out there.Race the Sun is easy to pick up but hard to put down... while always striving for that elusive 'high score' just over the horizon!Menus are a bit strange to navigate with a controller & the bright white tones can overwhelm, but other than these minor factors, this is a top quality & very addictive little indie title!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												☺ ""Just one more go..."" Gameplay.☺ Good controls.☺ A new level to race on every day!☹ Visually and Audibly Repetitive.☹ No access to previous levels.Recommended for fans of arcade racers, twitch or avoidance games.Race the Sun is a minimalist racing game that puts you in charge of an agile solar powered craft and its your job to keep rushing onwards, avoiding obstacles and the shade as you hurtle towards the horizon as the Sun that provides your power, steadily does the same.You'll crash, often, but not because of sloppy controls or unfair difficulty - most likely a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time or because you reacted a little too slowly. A simple tap of a button and you'll be back to racing almost instantly, providing a very arcadey experience without the need to carry a bag full of coins.An interesting feature of Race the Sun is the level you play on changes each day (unfortunately, you can't replay levels from previous days). This provides a fair amount of content as long as you revisit the game often, although the visuals and audio does begin to get a little repetitive.If things aren't hard enough for you, there is a brutal Apocalypse mode that throws more obstacles at you at a faster pace and there is Steam Workshop integration allowing you easy access to some great player made levels.While the game suits quick play sessions, you'll have to keep an eye on the Sun outside as well as ingame as it instils a feeling of ""Just one more run..."" as you zip around, picking up power ups and score multipliers and attempting to beat your last run or achieve some of the challenges (such as completing a region while only turning left) to level up and unlock a few abilities to help you do even better.A great arcade racer!

												Race the Sun is a very nice little game to play when you have nothing to do with yourself.It's very easy to learn, but like most things, a bit more difficult to master. You have to get as far as you can along the map, while avoiding deadly obstacals, before the sun goes down. While trying to get the highest score you can, you can pick up boosters that will temporarily stop the sun's slow descent. There are four different maps that you can play on. You start with the first one and can unlock the second and third ones by leveling up. If you want the fourth, you have to buy it. I have played and enjoyed the first three, but I haven't tried out the last one. All of the maps randomize every 24 hours, so the layout is slightly different each day.I play my own music when gaming, but the soundtrack for Race the Sun is something I wouldn't mind listening to. And if you don't enjoy it, there is always the mute button. In the end, I would recommend it to anybody who is thinking about buying it. "

												Overview: Arcade Racer focused on avoiding obstaclesThe Good:+The game goes on forever, the goal is not only how far you can go but how many points you can get. The premise is that your ship is solar powered, thus staying in the sunlight keeps you going. The sun slowly goes down creating more shadows.  Powerups can extend your time. + Every 24 hours the course is reset. Everything is randomized to a degree forcing you to rely more on skill and luck rather than memorization+ The game gives you a multiple objectives to complete. After completing them your ship gets upgraded. +VERY addicting, the game has the ""just one more time"" feeling to it. +Steamworkshop is intregrated very nicely with a variety of different maps to try out. +The game has a unique and simplistic artstyle to it. As the sun sets it creates a really nice setting. After playing some of the user generated maps you really see some of the verstatily of the engine and graphics despite how simple it is. +Hard mode to really test you to the limit....if you find the main game to easy.The Bad:-  You will get frustrated....a lot. ConclusionThis is a really fun and simple game was a simple premise and works wonderfully due to the randomness of the world. Its a game you can keep going back to and play in short sessions.  "

												With Kairo like graphics and atmospheric sounds Race the Sun addicts you to itself. The game is based on a very basic mechanics and you don't need to challenge with it. There are three game mods in the game which two of them will be opened after leveling up. Game's map is updating daily so you are playing in the new world every day. Also there are some upgrades you can earn by completing missions and then leveling up. They are really helpful to beat your last record and discover new levels in the game's world. It was cheap in the sales so you must give it a try. Any arcade fan can easily like this game.			"

Race The Sun is an adrenaline rush the likes of which few other games can compare! The whoosh as you soar past objects, the intensity as the sun threatens to disappear past the horizon, and the unbelievable moments of triumph when you make it through in one piece are but small bits of what makes for an extremely exhilarating experience.Your goal is simple: pilot a futuristic solar powered flying-craft at breakneck speeds, dodging obstacles and attempting to get as far as you can before the sun inevitably sets. What turns RtS from a simple detraction into an addiction is the execution. Every aspect has an unprecedented level of refinement, from the effortless maneuvering of your vehicle to the expertly placed obstructions which become increasingly complex and challenging the further you progress, show a clear attention to detail and an superb sense of direction by the developers.Aside from chasing the leaderboards, there are also 25 levels of skill based objectives for you to complete, which unlock upgrades and details to outfit your craft with. It took me about five hours to clear them all, at which point you truly begin your climb up the leaderboards. Although the game does lose a bit of its drive without these challenges to complete, having a newly remixed world every day (complete with daily leaderboards) still gives a reason to keep coming back for more, which is made even easier by how well RtS works as a pickup and play game, while still providing enough depth to make longer sessions just as enjoyable (those looking for an extra challenge will definitely find it in the ultra-hard Apocalypse mode).Lastly I can't stress enough how unexpectedly amazing the presentation is. The textures themselves might be basic, but there is an elegance in RtS's barren landscape that works amazingly well with how fast you will be soaring through it. The sparse use of color becomes even more important, outlining oncoming obstacles and highlighting power-ups in your peripheral vision that might otherwise be lost to more robust graphical effects. The stark contrast between light and shadow plays a key role in creating a sense of dread whenever you cross into one, letting you know the end is nigh if you don't get out of there fast. A great score and excellent sound effects round out the package, which words really can't do any justice to.It only took one round for me to get hooked to Race the Sun. Developer Flippfly absolutely nailed it and created something that truly astounded me, perhaps more so than any other game the year it released. I'm just going to end this by saying you need to play this for yourself! It's a breathtaking game that I desperately want to share with others, and one that deserves to be played by a far larger crowd than those who have managed to discover it. Don't let it slip by you, the sun is already setting.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Great game to play every now and then. Really fun and fast paced.Graphics looks minimalistic with just mostly grey but it is an interesting style and doesn't distract from the action.The Soundtrack is good but there sadly aren't that many songs. You can buy it here.Controlls feel very tight.There are also 4 different mode: Normal (which you will play most of the time)  Apocalypse (when you want more challenge)  Labyrinth (a more slower paced mode,which allows you to have more time to                                                                       decide where to go with a small amount of puzzles Zen Mode (accessable only with the DLC, this is a relaxing mode without any presure or challenge  The levels/world changes every 24h so you have enought time to try to get a high score for the day but also enought divercity so it doesn't get boring that quickly.There is one DLC which adds the Zen Mode (like already listed above)There is also the Steam Workshop with user-created levels but can give a nice change of the aesthetic and the gameplay.The game is currently in the Humble Weekly Sale[www.humblebundle.com]If you want to support the developers more buy it on their Web Site[flippfly.com]You will get a DRM-Free version of the game as well and the devs get a higher percentage of the money

A peaceful runner-style game where you guide a solar powered craft through an ever more shadowy obstacle course.From experience of driving towards the sun, you wouldn't think much of a game that focuses on flying towards the sun. Why would I want to do that? The sun is bright and makes my eyes hurt. This game is a fun way to use our imagination, and enjoy ourselves in a solar powered aircraft. If it helps, presume that you are wearing sunglasses, perhaps even fashionable ones. Do you feel cool? Are you prepared to look directly at bright lights? Fantastic.I imagine this takes place in a sad, dystopic future devoid of fine art or literature, where fossil fuels and other natural resources have been exhausted. All that remains are a few mostly abandoned cities, the wilds between, and due to the political turmoil of resource starvation, the world is on the eve of annihilation. Enter our protagonist, a strong silent individual. You're transporting yourself and a motley crew of rogues, miscreants, and iconoclast scientists aboard a solar-powered plane last-ditch effort to survive the imminent nuclear annihilation and attempt to prolong the death of a dying world much as a doctor extends the lives of those with chronic diseases. Specifically, you have a technology, a solar powered technology that is also built into your very aircraft. This technology opens portals to new worlds, and any one of them could be the paradise awaiting the future of humanity. Occasionally a bird approaches to aid you on your quest, as if nature itself is encouraging you in  your quest.Every once in a while you find structure capable of powering these warp gates and moving through them transports you to strange, fanciful, wonderful, and potentially terrible lands. Are any of these places inhabitable? It is unlikely, but any leap into the unknown could eventually show you the future of our species. There is such limited time though. This is certainly the last day before the missiles launch, and that means that when your plane falls to the ground at dusk, the world is lost.Controls are simple. You turn left, you turn right, you jump when you've got the right power up, and there's also a powerup which allows you to accidentally crash into a wall without dying. Throughout you pick up stars that increase your speed. You may note that speed will keep the sun higher on the horizon for longer periods of time.  You can do a barrel roll as well.If the sun sets you run out of power and die. If you collide with sufficient force, you die. The difficulty ramps up nicely as well, so that death, which comes to us all, may always be delayed a bit longer. There's a couple of starting levels of differing difficulty, and a workshop with extras, as well as an expansion that I have not tried as of yet. You level up by doing things like not turning left for a while, or being good at not hitting stuff, or collecting a lot of stuff in the air. These levels give you things like a magnet that makes it so you pick up stuff easier, or a battery that lets you survive in the shadows better. You can also put stickers on your plane, which alone with the portals is the closest thing to visual texture in the game. This game is grey scale polygons everywhere. Grey pyramids? Probably trees or mountains depending on scale? Grey rectangular prisms I imagine are buildings. There are some that look like shrubbery or boulders. The aesthetic is minimalist and produced a light feeling of ennui. There is quality lighting and shadow, which is fantastic as these are actually used as gameplay mechanics. Different modes have differing color schemes, and the apocalyptic mode is especially pleasant to view.The sounds are quite nice. The music is of limited quantity, but the quality is apparent and it elicits an appropriate response.If you have an imagination, or just want something of variable relaxation and pace, something of an original concept, then this could be quite an enjoyable original addition for you. Personally I gave it my full attention for several relaxing enjoyable hours.This review has been produced in accordance with green technologies, specifically the aeronautical technologies behind solar powered propulsion. These machines are often light weight fully electric craft and represent an important engineering challenge for developing technologies for cleaner, cheaper aircraft.

 Don't let the shadows catch you! The goal is clear: get as many points as possible and as far as possible without crashing into something or running out of solar power. Easier said then done!Even though this game is as arcady as it can be, it never gets boring for a number of reasons:  The map regenerates every 24 hours, making it fresh and new every day you play it. It's great to play when you're drunk or high and or with friends. The controls are great and responsive and if you die, it's your fault so you never feel cheatedI highly recommend getting this game, even if you don't like arcade-style games, because this one really mixes things up!

												The idea of a minuscule studio putting out a game that will potentially entrance millions with its easy accessibility and well-graduated complexity curve proves that there is still room in the market for the little guy. Race the Sun is not only a fun little addiction but hopefully also a harbinger of the return of boutique developers.If Race The Sun’s tracks remain as consistently well-paced and tiered as the raft of stages we’ve experienced to date, then it can be considered a success rather than an experiment: a confident genre hybrid worthy of your time and patience because who knows, today could be your day.Race the Sun is very close to a perfect pick-up-and-play game, except for the bit where it’s very hard not to keep playing once you’ve started. A quick break easily turns into one more attempt, trying to plot a different course over the cluttered plains, maximizing Tri collection while minimizing the risk of turning into a cloud of debris.An original take on the arcade time-trial formula.Race the Sun is an elegant endeavor, pairing slick action and stiff challenge with systems that make you want to come back day after day.

												Race the Sun is a very simple game, your objective is to go as far as you can before the sun when down because your vehicle is powered by the sun and will be destroyed without power. Along the way you find many obstacle here and there to give the game some challenge.To be honest i didn't know this game is exist before i bought it from humble bundle, and i actually glad that i bought it. This game mechanic along with the graphic and the sound effect is really good and simple. It give you the sense of peace and you rarely get that feeling when you try to play this type of game where your objective is to go as far as you can before dying and the high speed vehicle that you are trying to control feels very epic and futuristic and thats a good thing. The game also give you some simple objective for you to complete like avoid hitting anything in 2 stage or collect this amount of point or jump 5 time in one run or something along those line. In my opinion that objective is really refreshing and it will makes you try the game with a different tactics than usual. If you complete the objective you will level up and you will get many new upgrade for your ship like a magnet to catch all the point near you and all of the other stuff.Soo the conclusion is this game is really fun and enjoyable to play in your spare time when you are bored, its a good game and the price is not that expensive either. :3 But if you looking for a game with alot of feature sadly this game is not for you, but if you looking for a cool and fun casual game this game is for you !Recommended ! :3			"

 Overview  Race The Sun is an atypical single player racing game that puts you in control of a geometric solar powered craft on a never-ending, futile journey to keep a fully charged battery and keep the sun from setting. As you race towards the always distant sun, you’ll have to circumvent an ever-changing obstacle course and collect power-ups and energy boosts to keep the sun in the sky for as long as you can. Watch out though, as one frontal collision and your run is over and back to the beginning you go.The game itself comes at you from a very minimalist approach, though there’s a bit more to the game at first glance. There’s some real satisfying work that goes into completing it and it really kept me hooked, but Race The Sun suffers from longevity issues which makes leaving a lasting impression on you difficult to master. The main game, as mentioned above, you pilot a winged solar craft through courses that change once every 24hrs. While many of the obstacles will remain similar at first glance, the position at which they come to you, the order and the location of the power-ups will all be different each day. There’s an in-game counter stating when you can expect a new course to play on. This is a wonderful device that keeps the content fresh without having to constantly release DLC content. The game, to an extent, creates it for you. As you proceed through these levels, you’ll be given side challenges that will help level up your craft. These can range from how many icons you collect [called tris], your bonus multiplier, how many power-ups you use and so forth. They are scaled from a simple easy to hard scale and the value of tokens earned is based on that scale. As you level up, you’ll gain new, permanent abilities that you can toggle on and off based on your play style or the type of challenge you’re working on; these range from a magnet to draw in tris, the ability to hold additional powers like shields and jump abilities, a larger battery pack and more. There are no traditional difficulty settings in Race The Sun, but instead different game modes that stand in their place. Your typical playthrough would fall under the “Normal” category, while you can unlock an “apocalypse” mode; the game’s version of “hard”. In juxtaposition to those, there is also a casual mode with no sun that allows you to just play the game in a stress free environment, as well as a top-down version.I never ran into many problems while playing. There were some instances of FPS drops that were really irritating on such a minimalist game; a few times it cost me my run. They didn’t stop me from playing, but it wasn’t a problem I was ever able to locate and fix either. The only other issue I have with the game was the difficulty spike between normal runs and the heightened “apocalypse” mode. I consider myself a junkie for difficulty, but even as I learned the ins and outs of the courses and their routines, it felt far too scaled upward to remain as enjoyable. I found myself completely ignoring this aspect of the game, which is a shame.The height of the game’s enjoyment came, for me, with doing the in-game challenges. However, once you fully level up your craft you no longer have a list to work on, making the game fall back on just racing the sun. While fun, there felt like a chunk of purpose was removed from the game when I had nothing else to strive for other than my own personal record. That nearly tangible feeling of excitement vanished just like the challenges did. Aside from the Steam achievements, I no longer had a reason to keep playing…so I didn’t. I wish I had a reason to go back.  Pros   A great test of reflexes and skill if you enjoy racing-type games. Friendly UI setup. Easy to drop in and out of for short or long sessions. Lovely art style with a good use of colors and B&W canvases.  There is a level editor, though it takes some practice. Cons    There are instances of FPS drops for some users. Lacks a proper end game to keep user presence and longevity. The “apocalypse” setting can be daunting for some users with no way to adjust it.Overall, I really enjoyed Race The Sun. The simplicity in its design balanced out the sharp difficulty curve as you learned to play the game. It balanced it’s color scheme and rigged layout with splashes of color and smooth [for the most part] gameplay. While I wish there was more to keep me going back, I enjoyed every minute of it.			"

												You have probably heard the expression ""Less is more"". And it pretty much applies here because this game is quite simple with minimalistic design. But just because it is that way doesn't mean that you will be able to complete it in few hours or feel that there's something missing. Let me tell you more about it.Let's start with the story. There is not other way  to put it but to say that there isn't one. Yep, it is simple as that. Basically you are piloting a spacecraft fueled by solar energy and the sun is your death timer. And for this game it couldn't have been better. On the bright side you don't need to worry about the story being to complex, bad or uninteresting. This game is more about highest scores and tense gameplay. But let's talk about those simplistic graphics. When I launched the game for the first time it looked boring for few seconds but not much more than that because simple graphics can be good in its own right. In my opinion the game should be fun and engaging first and only then it should be an eye candy. There are of course games that are an eye candy first but we're not talking them right now. The beauty of the game in the arrangement of the obstacles, it's in clouds, in shapes and in the variety of all those things. But we'll talk about those in detail later on. For now let's talk gameplay. This being basically a racing game where you, uh... race the sun and trying not to let it set involves high speed. You need to be as fast as you can and there are things that make you go faster like boosts and you will have to find those boosts if you don't want to run out of energy. There are other bonuses in the game as well. Jumping for example that can help you avoid certain death. Or the one that is basically an extra life that can be crucial in the later stages of the game. And there are 'tris' that increase your points multiplier. Although you can complete first few stages without too much maneuvering you will have to change your course if you want to find any of these. There are many challenges and achievements too that will push your comprehension of what is possible in this game. The game does no have difficulty settings but it definitely gets harder and harder as you move further from region to region. And the obstacles change too. Ranging for rocks to mountains, windmills, falling skyscrapers and more.  And there is one more thing that made all of the components into one hell of a symphony - music. It amazingly matches the game. It's also simplistic and changes based on where you are in the game and the surroundings. I can't say that there's too much variety with music but for me it glues everything together quite nicely. So should you buy it? Well, I got mine for free during some promotion but it was on my wishlist so I would have bought it anyway and had my money worth. You should buy this game if you don't really give a crab about the story and you don't mind spending countless hours trying to complete the next region or you're into high scores and online leaderboards.

												I've loved this game since I came across it a few months back, and was absolutely over the moon when the dev's behind it announced they'd finally made it through the greenlight process and were releasing it on steam.So what do you need to know about it?Well, let me ask you this.  When was the last time you really remember doing the old ""sega"" lean?  (seriously if you're too young to remember that, don't even ask) In my case, before Race the Sun, I'd have had to say, ""I don't remember"" - seriously, it really had been that long since any game was immersive enough to make me lean in time to my movements on the screen, like that was going to have any effect on my ability to steer.Race the Sun had me doing it within seconds of trying it out, and does so with the kind of regularity which is as refreshing as it is tragic, lol.Under the hood, it's a basic time trial racer... but it feels more open than that.  Graphically it's an awesome kick back into retro gaming, whilst in itself being pretty smooth and well done.Levels are a mix of custom creations, both by the devs and other players, and proceedurally generated goodness, and the maps change on a daily basis (at the time of writing) keeping things fresh and meaning that no one player can grind their way to an unbeatable position on the leaderboard for a given map.Like your first hit of a Class A substance, Race the Sun is incredibly easy to pick up and start, but very hard to put down for any significant period of time, and for me at least, has become one of my go-to games for when I want a nice, enjoyable game to chill out playing without needing to become stupidly focused or remember whole codices of ingame stats and background info.As a final thought, all I can add is that I've gotten far more bang for my buck with this game than I have with way too many other titles in the past, and unlike a lot of them, I know I'll be back to play it from time to time.

 A MINIMALISTIC Breakdown Rating PROS Simple controls. Minimalistic geometric designs (simple yet elegant). Quite challenging. World changes everyday. Low specifications required (who could ask for more?). Also available on Google Play and Apple App Store.CONS Slippery-like movements (when playing in PC). You totally need a controller (optional). Kinda dark at some regions and some areas are edgy to drift/turn to another direction.OVERALL - This game is absolutely simple yet amazing. Worth to buy the game and its DLCs (Sunrise DLC is so awesome).RATING - 9/10 would find ourselves chasing the sun until sunset.			"

												This is a runner game based on boost pickups to prolong your run before the sun sets down, which leads to running out of energy and slowing down to a halt. You initially learn the ropes by completing challenges, and level up to unlock new features and cosmetics as well. I highly recommend focusing on hitting max level before considering to do anything else, also since you'll get to experience the most optimized way to play the game.You get one seed to play with per 24h with its own leaderboards, which is fine, since the game's concept is early route planning and endless avoidance with quick decisions on your feet. The maps have set patterns, so even if you're not that great at video games, you can still memorize them and act on instinct after you get familiar enough.Overall a great game, good experience, would recommend to everyone and anyone who looks for both a casual or a challenging experience.

Review - Race The Sun ""An exciting mini-game that could gob some of your free time."" Race The Sun is a game where you play a solar-powered spacecraft. You'll race from region to region with the setting sun as your timer. Burst through the unique and elegantly made obstacles as you collect energy boosts and other power-ups such as a vertical leap and a speed boosts. As you progress through the levels, you'll unlock upgrades that you can equip to your ship or better yet use a different ship for your high-speed chase for glory.Race The Sun is a decent game but if you're a bit cautious with its price, you can just try to get when it goes on sale. I recommend this game to those who are looking for decent mini-games that are really worth it to burn some of your free time.My Personal Rating:Gameplay: 8/10Music: 7/10Graphics: 7/10Story/Plot: n/aOverall: 7/10			"

												The minimalist graphics, sounds, and mechanics contribute a sort of zen quality; relaxing, in a way, while requiring every reflex to be spot-on.  Each region has a distinct visual style, making you want to explore it, but there's no way to go too far off the path, and the repetitive nature within a level makes it hard to remember what comes next.  Upgrades are tied to a series of achievements, some trivial, others frustrating, but always having three current ones makes it fairly easy to climb quickly.My children, too, love it, partly for the thrill of seeing a place they've never been able to get to before, and partly for the flashy barrel rolls.  Granted, they die even more often than I do, but that makes it even easier to prefix a request with ""Okay, the next time you die, ...""			"

												To look at this game's store page you'd think, ""looks kinda lame"" however you'd be just as completely and totally WRONG as I was.  First up, and I'm not gonna lie to you here, this game is addictive.  And when I say it's addictive I don't mean, ""oh what a nice little game, I'll play for a few minutes then get on with my day...""  No, it's more like the kind of addiction that grabs you instantly and never lets go.  I'd say it's impossible to play, ""just one round.""  No no.... you'll be like oh man I gotta do that again, I know I can do it better.  Wait wait... I know where I screwed up just one more round.  Oh man, I can't let that stop me.  Just a little more.""But DJ so what if it's addictive it just looks like a silly time waster and I can find those for free.""  Once again your dead wrong.  What the game lacks in graphics it more than double makes up for in gameplay.  It's a racing game that gives you just as much thrills and spills as any racing game out there.  It's a game of dodging stuff that will leave you holding your breath as you narrowly miss that wall with a feeling of relief when you do.  It's a game to challenge you to beat your friends high scores that's just as enjoyable to achieve as the best competitive multiplayer game out there.  It's a game about change as each new day brings a new map to challenge your friends to.  It's a creators paradise where you can create maps and challenges for all your friends and community.  Belive me when I say, this game is a whole lot more than it looks.You honestly can't go wrong adding this gem of a game to your game library.  Buy it when it's cheap, but even at $10.00 I'd still say it's more than worth it.  It'll be your best spent money all week.			"

												So...this game. I like the concept of Race the Sun.  Fly fast, avoid obstacles, keep going!   Pretty simple really.  I don't even mind the bland graphics.  They service the purpose. You know what I don't like about Race the Sun?  I really suck at it!  That's more from 40 year old crappy reflexes than the game's fault though.  Do you have better reflexes than middle aged man?  You might like it.  I can see the potential in there.   I'd say the $9.99 asking price is a bit steep though.  I got it for $2 or 3  off of Indie Game Stand, so keep your eyes peeled.  It's a good value at it's $3.99 price.			"

												Addictive as hell. Minimalist graphics and gameplay, yet what few elements there are, they are done masterfully. Runs at high quality on the integrated graphics of a laptop; if you tote around one with a dedicated GPU, you don't even need to turn it on - you can play on-the-go without burning through your battery.Even though sometimes you want the next map to just roll around already, I think the decision to rotate them once every day is very spot-on. It forces you to just relax, pull back a bit, and remember that games should be played in moderation.			"

												Race The Sun is one of those endless runners we've seen hundreds of times before on our mobile phones. But we've rarely seen one appear on Steam. It's because Race The Sun is stylish, fun and addictive, and not necessarily in that order.You basically steer a ship across a randomly generated world with tons of objects to avoid and power-ups to collect. It's fast paced and objective based. Well, it's not required, really, but it helps you upgrade your ship later on and might make your life a little easier. There are always 3 random objectives to complete, and with each objective you complete you'll earn 1 (easy objective) to 3 (harder objective) upgrade points. Upgrades can be a higher multiplier right from the start or the ability to store 2 power-ups instead of 1.While racing you have to collect yellow power-ups to keep raising the sun. Your ship is energy powered and staying in the shadows for too long will slow you down, resulting in a lower score (because, obviously, you can't collect items as quickly anymore). And if the sun goes down it's game over, too.In the end I was pleasantly surprised by Race The Sun. I grew tired of endless runners a long time ago, but the combination of random worlds, power-ups and objectives make this game feel fresh somehow. Praise the sun ![Rating: 78/100]			"

The game is minimalist and too much can not write about it, but does that mean it is bad? Absolutely!We control a solar-powered plane. Our goal is to fly toward the sun, avoid shadows and do not hit anything. The music is pleasing to the ear and does not irritate, sounds collected bonuses also are ok. The graphics, it's a matter of taste, I like to such minimalism and it speaks to me. To all of this there is very a honey flight model. The plane responds very well to control. The game starts off easy and gradually increasing challenge while giving a lot of laughter and a little bit of gymnastics (some people will curse). To fly millimeters of obstacles, spin bypass two obstacles, or the slipping through narrow gaps will make shout of victory, and in a moment dispersed we pitch on the next object. It's not a production in which you'll soak for hours (although I couldn't tear myself - on the principle ""one last time"") but to turn once and chillout. I strongly recommend it, because I'm having fun brilliantly.			"

This game will truly put your reflexes to a test, how well you manage in a split second situation between life and death when the game pumps the speed to a level a human most likely won't manage to handle in reality. While the graphics of the game are not as impressive as they seem, they do give you a take of breath many times, admiring the simplistic beauty as you graze through obsticales, doing whatever you can to hold onto the light of the sun to not run out of power, it's beautiful. That aside, the game is intense, fun, and somewhat competitive, have fun beating your friends high score as you play this game to see who's the better leaderboard master, it'll be worth a laugh or two.A tip, you ask of? Don't stop, full spead ahead, and keep racing the Sun, until the end.			"

												Great time killer. Surprisingly fun and challenging, I've put 20+ hours into this game + DLC and it's well worth the money I've spent on it, The further you get into the game, the more difficult it gets and it's a pleasant challenge, some missions are absurd and difficult as hell but that just adds to the fun and can add extreme pleasure when you actually finally do them.All in all, quite fun and an amazing way to kill time, especially with the challenges it sets you and the DLC makes for a very calming addition if you want a 5 minute chill break. The soundtrack also fits the game pretty well and it's just all 'round fun.Side Note: I often play this game while listening to podcasts now and it's a great way to still be doing something while listening to a podcast, it's not too much of a distraction from the podcast and you never really get bored like you would if you were just listening to a podcast alone, I can easily listen to 2 or 3 hour long podcasts while playing this and never get bored, it's great for that aspect, there's also always the leveling system and then the nice achievements to try and get which add a little bit extra to the game if you want or need it.

												This game makes hours feel like minutes. I think that the first region has a good learning curve, you sit back dodge obstables and collect blue items which adds to your multiplier score, yellow adds time and gives you a speed boost, green adds a jump and purple adds a get out of jail free card if you crash.When i reached the second region i found myself swaying my head side to side when i dodged.At the third region and beyond i had my controller in a death grip and my face planted against the screen.It leaves a smile on my face when i pick up an yellow time/boost orb and i loose control of the situation thinking im gonna crash but for some lucky reason i manage to get through.The world also changes everyday which mix things up a bit and keeps it fresh. You also get tasks to do which raises your level and unlocks abilities for your ship. "

												Race the Sun is a type of forever runner game that has you piloting a flightless hover ship as it glides along a minimalist desert of walls, triangle spikes and blocks that fall over. Your ship is solar powered and going too far into shadows will slow you down and with the sun setting in the horizon itself, that turns the sun into a timer. Slamming into an object is failure, but you can graze an edge of your ship and be fine for a while.On the surface, there's nothing wrong with the game, its easy to play, left and right to steer and well left and right to steer. It takes a moment for your ship to shift. The controls are simple and work well with a keyboard or 360 controller. You can do things like barrel rolls if you steer too far one way then hard turn it the other way. You can even unlock a single jump and other upgrades for your ship like a magnet that draws in orbs.The game is shallow and even worse it relies on only one level for the most part. This single level resets itself each day. New day, new level. Other than that, you can unlock two additional levels and even play a credits level that has you flying under the credits in what feels like a flat open space with no challenge rather than an actual level.Because its just one level, and the game never modifies itself, it makes the game feel like its more about memory than skill. Sure it takes skill to move between two falling blocks, but it takes memory to remember that you can just drive around the wall to a much easier path.Each level consists of different regions and each region seems to be a loop of itself twice. Well loop with some extras thrown in. As if someone copied and pasted then added some extra fluff. Between each region a white bird will zig-zag and drop four orbs one direction and four orbs another direction. Then it will drop a sun orb which surges your ship to its top speed. You'll find several blue orbs, sun orbs and green jump orbs throughout each level. There are ramps here and there that let you catch big air, falling blocks and shadows to slow you down. The funny thing is you can jump off a ramp high over orbs and it will still collect them if you touch the beam of light over them. Perhaps that's an unlocked feature. Its about as bare bones as it comes to runners.You'll find portal gates that for whatever reason send you into space where you have a view from the cockpit. The game plays much slower and everything is black. You get to see a galactic space battle in black and white as you fly through it dodging lesser vessels as they zoom by. It feels out of place at best and only makes the game feel a lot easier going so slow. If we're still piloting the same ship when we're in the portal, am I still powered by the sun? Where is the sun in space? I sure can't see the sun.In the main game itself you can change the camera view from a behind chase cam to a bumper view. Inside the galactic space battle, you're stuck in the cockpit, pressing the camera view button shifts the view by a few pixels. its odd that the game shifts at all when its that small of a difference.There's a leveling up mechanic that has you accomplishing three goals to get to the next level. Getting to level eleven and twenty-five unlock new levels, but to get there you'll need to do things like jump ten times and do twenty barrel rolls in a single play. The further you go, the more challenging these goals become. Its definitely a way to add some longevity to a shallow game that feels like little to no effort was put in. The entire game feels like no effort was put in and its really the players that need to put time into the game. I want to play here, not work here.To the game's credit, it looks great. The minimalist approach enhances the game and my enjoyment of it. It makes good use of a dynamic lighting system. The sun casts shadows, although some of the shadows seem to be painted on hazards to hurt your time. Even with a sun, some levels are just gray. Yes indeed, two-hundred and fifty-five shades of gray monochromatic action. Of course a level can be any color, I just seem find gray levels.Race the Sun has a level editor and Steam workshop integration, so you can always find new levels. I took one look at the level editor, saw how deep it is and then closed it. I've learned so many other level editors that its tough to justify putting time into this one. The real problem is why is that our job as players to make new levels? Sure its fun to create levels, publish them and rate them, but as a developer why are we stuck with one level per day on the computer version of what is essentially a mobile game? That sort of mechanic is what keeps people coming back and sitting through ads day after day and not people that paid money.Speaking of paying money and mobile ports, on the start screen, they have DLC, the soundtrack and the mobile version to buy. That's understandable, a lot of bigger games, non indie games with shareholders often use this tactic right front and center and fans let them know it. Race the Sun is immune to this and people still manage to love the game for its brief and addictive gameplay. For a game that sells a soundtrack, why is there only one song? This whole game seems like a big cash grab.There's so little here that its a starvation and so the game keeps you coming back for more with daily courses. You keep coming back to get your moneys worth, to get that quick shallow fix and move on with life knowing that level you spent an hour memorizing and mastering will never appear again. Your work, effort and bragging rights are replaced by tomorrow's level. A chance to wake up and do it all over again.While I hate to judge a game for everything but the game, there's just not much game here. you go left, you go right, take a ramp. remember what you did wrong. Wash; rinse; repeat.			"

												I downloaded this game from steam when it was free. After a bit of gameplay experience, the thing I want to say about this game is the following:This is a really simple game, simplistic graphics, not too complex gameplay. You are controlling an aircraft which is powered by sunlight. You constantly have to follow the sun to keep you powered up and what that means basically is you have to fly through different terrain at extremely high speed without crashing. Sounds easy right? It actually is quite an easy and relaxing game. The graphics are simple but that doesnt mean they are not nice. They are minimalistic. And the game has a great soundtrack. And the whole atmosphere gives a kind of ""after humanity"" feeling. The controls are easy and the map is changing every 24 hours so you wont get bored of it easily. Unless you find the gameplay itself boring. And there are also quite an amount of challenges up to date.Overall (I want to start with the cons)Cons:- The gameplay might be too simple for some people- Can get repetitive- All challenges can be accomplished in around a dayPros:- I find the graphics (personally) satisfying- Relaxing gameplay- The game has a unique feeling- Nice atmosphere- Even if you run out of in game challenges, steam achievements will keep you fresh- 24 hrs changing map- Easy to do, hard to master- The overall concept is great and it worksI would definitely recommend at least giving a shot to this game if you want something relaxing yet challenging in your inventory.

												this game brings back a bit the Star Wing (Star Fox) - feeling, its nice to hang on but the steering is a bit difficult to adapt(tested with controller)  and the levels are not easy.the workshop seems nice and the standard world is changing in intervals.i just wish a barrel-roll could be done instantly like in Star Wing ;Da rating between 70 and 80 like metacritics have so is ok.i'd recommend buying in sale.(50% and more)			"

												This game has a very bitter aftertaste.If you just want play an easy game on the normal mode for a maximum 3 hours this game seems to be fair enough, but don't expect too much to happen during that time, if you already decided to buy it.Also, if you just want to chill out a bit and don't care about scores or achievements, this game might be a good choice and you don't have to read on.The game looks very nice on its screenshots, but it is the most monotonous game I've ever played. I don't want to say that this game is horrible, but even without my hopes and expectations I had when seing the screens of this game, I am sure that I still wouldn't recommend it. It is just not my cup of tea and I'm going to tell you why...I like racing games, especially the fast and highly unrealistic ones I played in old times. Obviously this game is nothing like that. To be honest, I expected it to be somewhat like StarWing (SNES, 1993), because it almost looks like it. I bought this game, because its ""fast"" gameplay and interesting look seemed promising. Well, this game did not meet my expectation in any way. Please do not get fooled by the screenshots that imply that there is a variety of space themed or interesting levels. Those are temporary warp zones and not even fun ones to play either.At some point this game can be fast, but is it any good when you cannot manouver fast enough to react to certain objects (not even with the steering upgrade)? The controls are extremely limited. You are only able to steer left and right, a button to activate your power-up and that's IT. NO turning your vehicle upside down or sideways to fly through narrow spaces. Actually, you are able to perform an aileron roll (commonly refered to as barrel roll), but it does absolutely nothing besides reminding you of how awesome it would be to quit the game and play a different one. You are not even able to steer your vehicle up or down, while in midair. Even the rare and short space zones cannot be navigated 3Dimensionally. The control settings say that you can map ""up"" and ""down"", but it's only for the menu (what a freakin' joke). You can only jump, which is one of three power-ups. In this game nothing spectacular or exciting will happen, due to limited gameplay features..To be fair, the normal game mode is very easy and to a certain extend fun to play, but if you wanted to go deeper into what the game holds in store for you, you have to play its Apocalypse mode, which except for the beginning of each level is absolutely random and requiers 50% of pure luck and 50% of skill. Besides I really don't want to get started about what's wrong with that game mode and I only want to say that it is frustrating NOT because it's difficult, but because UNPREDICTABLE level elements can ruin a good run instantly with cheap deaths. I mean, of course you get better and learn certein patterns that might repeat and yet still a high share of luck remains. Not even trial and error will get you further, but rather plain patience and multiple runs. For all those achievement hunters out there: obtaining the hardest achievement in the game is not too hard, but it can be so boring that it makes you actually wish for a breath of fresh air outside, watching a real sunset for over an hour, rather than playing this monotonous game. Really, there's not much variety to be discovered in this game. It's just a game with unused potential. I like its cover picture though...			"

												Race the Sun is a brilliant little endless runner. This is a genre that I often want to like but frequently fail to do so as the execution never quite works for me. But in Race the Sun it does. The 24 hour world resets strike a great balance between getting the chance to practice and perfect something, while always having something new to try each day. Also, unlike the side scrollers in the genre, RtS offers a degree of movement freedom that actually scratches something of an exploration itch in me.			"

												Rated ""Awesome"" for everyone.Most of my playtime with Race The Sun has been via the Humble Store (DRM-free + Steam key) version. So don't take my Steam stats at face value.As racers go, Race The Sun is as good as it gets. Race The Sun offers a broad appeal by being easy to learn and difficult to master. Race The Sun also ashews the usual 'cut throat' approach to competition by letting you compete against yourself, THEN showing you how your performance stacks up on Leaderboards. Courses that are randomly generated every twenty-four hours keep things fresh. Toss in low hardware requirements, gamepad support, and cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux) compatibility and its accessibility is unmatched. Race The Sun is every bit worth owning whether you're a racing fan or not.			"

												I got this game because it was free for a day and had steam cards. After playing it I'm considering buying the DLC.Mechanically its very straightforward -  you steer a solar powered ship and see how far you can go. As your travel you collect power-ups while trying to avoid the shadows and not crash. If you survive long enough the sun sets and your race ends.While playing you have three goals to complete in order to level up and unlock more options. Some of these are really annoying (like only turning left), whereas others are simple (like hit X objects). The options vary and can be different game modes or unlocked items to aid your flight.The track changes each day which makes this an excellent casual play game. Its also fairly addictive, I frequently found myself thinking ""Just one more try and I'll make it to the next region or complete the next goal.""I wouldn't want to pay full price for it, but I recommend it when its bundled or on sale.

												in this game, you control a solar-powered jet going through obstacle courses with the sun as the timer. You canuse the powerup obtained throughout the game to get higher score and better chance to survive. If you don't like the default track, you can browse through the Steam workshop and find more available tracks developed by the community. The graphic is simple. Control is good, only left, right and action button. The default tracks are refreshed every week so you won't get bored,  though it just retrack the obstacles.The thing I don't like is the gamepad navigation is awful. Example like in main menu, i have to try really hard to get the cursor to move to the option menu. I had to rely on mouse for navigation. The soundtrack are pretty plain.If you're planning for a short-burst game or just wanna have relaxed game, this can be a good choice.  How long can you go before the sun goes down?			"

The game DOES reward you with gradual skill increases, and you WILL see how you improve over extended plays.I just hope I can soon take the guy out who's constantly 4 or 5 million in front of all the other scores.  Right now, my top score is 2.2 million - working on getting past level 8.Great game, tho I can't say that it goes quickly - the replay ""AAUGH I CAN BEAT THAT"" bit is a bit too high for that sort of thing.  If you use this to take a break while something compiles, you may need to remind yourself to return to coding.			"

												very good at what it does. if you enjoy dodging at speed - get.Edit:After continuing to play each track most days I feel that I can give a better description of your development. Level generation works like this:Each region has a number of different setups for each part, so, rather than generating completely new levels, it mixes them up - so while it keeps replayability by changing track, you also improve because you are actually practicing similar courses and learn how to react. The track and scoreboards change every 24 hours.I tend to get tired of games once I complete or master them, but I continue to enjoy playing this for about 15-30 minutes a day to play the tracks, and with user created levels coming soon it can only become a better deal.

												In some ways, this game is the perfect metaphor for our lives. Each of us is the little spacecraft and we chase after the light of our dreams. There will be several paths for us to try out on our journey, with the shadow of our doubts slowing us down if we let it. We will inevitably crash and burn many... many times into obstacles that came out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and there will be that one stage that will seem impossible. However, if we have the courage to press that 'retry' button, then eventually we will beat the game. Just remember to never lose sight of your dream, and don't let the sun set on you before you get to the end. Great game to play every now and then. Really fun and fast paced.Graphics looks minimalistic with just mostly grey but it is an interesting style and doesn't distract from the action.The Soundtrack is good but there sadly aren't that many songs. You can buy it here.Controlls feel very tight.There are also 3 different mode:Normal (which you will play most of the time) Apocalypse (when you want more challenge) Labyrinth (a more slower paced mode,which allows you to have more time to decide where to go with a small amount of puzzlesZen Mode (accessable only with the DLC, this is a relaxing mode without any presure or challengeThe levels/world changes every 24h so you have enought time to try to get a high score for the day but also enought divercity so it doesn't get boring that quickly.Overall i think it is a great game for all ages and you should definetly check it out			"

												A hidden gem! No seriously; if you like ""endless running"" games, then this is an excellent choice.The minimalistic visuals are beautiful on their own, managing to create some wonderful vistas. The main interest you'll have in this game, though, is the gameplay. While seemingly simple and repetitive, if you're into games like these, then you'll probably not end up bored.It does one thing, and it does it really, really well. You're a solar craft that travels the landscape, avoiding objects and shadows in your way. The sun is, almost in the literal sense of the word, your death timer, as your solar craft will quickly drain battery if the sun goes down, or if you spend too much time in shadows (damn you clouds! *shakes fist angrily toward the sky*).Race The Sun features a daily challenge, in the form of a randomly generated map, leaderboards, a pretty nice soundtrack, and some basic customization of the craft. Customization includes various wing decals, as well as the more important attachments that enhance your solar craft in many different ways. These are unlocked throughout the 25 levels, that you in turn gain through more or less difficult objectives given to you while playing.It's great when you don't know what to do with yourself, when you're coming home tired from work or school, or when you just want to relax. For me personally, it works great as both an exciter and a relaxer, depending on my mood and the situation.If you'd rather play your own music, instead of the in game one, I'll have you know it works well with almost anything from death metal to drum and bass.

												To be succinct, this is an extremely slick and well-designed ""racing"" game. There are lots of little tricks to learn and with the course changing each day, it helps mix things up and gives you the chance to adapt to new terrain.The whole game though is ultimately a grind with the focus on achieving certain goals so that you can level up and unlock more options, powers and upgrades. Sometimes the challenges you may be up to do not mesh well with the level currently available that day which is a touch frustrating.It's a solid game to play for a little bit each and every other day to work your way up.

Review - Race The Sun""An exciting mini-game that could gob some of your free time.""    Race The Sun is a game where you play a solar-powered spacecraft. You'll race from region to region with the setting sun as your timer. Burst through the unique and elegantly made obstacles as you collect energy boosts  and other power-ups such as a vertical leap and a speed boosts. As you progress through the levels, you'll unlock upgrades that you can equip to your ship or better yet use a different ship for your high-speed chase for glory.    Race The Sun is a decent game but if you're a bit cautious with its price, you can just try to get when it goes on sale. I recommend this game to those who are looking for decent mini-games that  are really worth it to burn some of your free time.My Personal Rating:Gameplay: 8/10Music: 7/10Graphics: 7/10Story/Plot: n/aOverall: 7/10			"

												One of the most stunning games that I've played in a while. Though the game may be a bit repetitive and the menu a tad buggy for me at times (not too often to even really matter), it's fluid gameplay (Keyboard is still fun, but a controller is a lot better) and challenges will keep you coming back for more. The soundtrack is just as great as the tone gradually darkens or hastens with each level or when the Sun drops low enough, indicating the intensity/urgency of the situation. The thrill of just barely slipping through a tight corridor or gliding past a set of mountains/spikes/blocks is also worth noting.

To me it looks more like a phone app than a pc game. Regardless, it's great+ The game is fun, the sensation of speed you can get is a pure pleasure.+There are a few different gamemodes which all deliver a different experience+ The core mechanic is original: you're a solar-enery space ship and you have to be faster than the sun so that it doesn't set in order to always have light to fly with.+ The world will change everytime you launch the game, which means every run is different. Each world lasts long enough for you to learn its patterns and obstacles placements but not long enough to get you bored.-It gets a bit repetitive after a few hours. To avoid that, the devs should probably: make the space ship upgrade system a little bit more complex and interesting, with more special upgrades and such. They could also add a few more mechanics to the game to make it deeper. I'm far from being a game developper but I'm just giving my opinion on how you could improve this game.ConclusionIt's probably not worth 10€. I would say get it for free or on sale. Considering some great games like orion or tf2 respectively cost 1€ and 0€, I can't understand why this one costs 10 times more.			"

												You play as an aircraft, powered by the sun, racing through procedurally created regions. The sun is ever setting, and by collecting speed boosts, you can give yourself more time to race the sun through ever more hectic regions. Along the way are other powerups and combo tris to let your score climb ever higher, as long as you can keep up your speed so the sun doesn't set. If the sun goes down, if you drive in shadows, if you bump objects, you slow down, and if you stop, you die. The game can get very intense in later levels as you make hairpin turns on twitch reactions, diving from speed boost to speed boost in a frantic attempt to keep the sun juuuust over the horizon. There's also world portals that will teleport you to user-made levels, some of which are detah traps, and others which are just pure bonus score increasers and will send your score sky high.As you play the game you can unlock challenges that, when completed, will unlock new decals and cosmetics, as well as upgrade the powerups you can get, or let you carry more of them. A new level is generated every 24 hours, so leaderboards are changing constantly, and there's always a new level to try to route yourself through. The game also boasts an extra difficult Apocalypse mode, and a slower, more puzzley Labyrinth mode, for extra challenges. There's also a no-sun-timer DLC available if that's what you're interested in, too.Truth be told, I don't know if the game is worth ten dollars. It's really fun and engaging, and new levels every day encourage constant improvements and score increasing on new leaderboards, but at the end of the day, it really is something that you could play on any old games website with flash games.If you're interested in Endless Runners, and like them, defintiely give the game a go!

												Since i got this game for free, my expectations were quite low. However, this game REALLY surprised me. Even if my expectations were higher, it would still surprise me. Most of indie game lacks something in my opinion. Most of them tend to be generic, they seem to lack character or something like this. But this one is a fine indie game. The gameplay is very good, the soundtrack does its job and the graphics are smooth. Its a casual game, that you can play anytime. Its rewarding.			"

												Makes me scream more than my Ex's ever did!This game is so stressful but in a good way. Having just started not long ago im not too good yet but i can at least make it around lvl 6 or so. At about lvl 4 i can feel my toes cringing and i lose control over my vocals as i struggle to dodge and weave my way around obstacles. It's a lot of fun and i like that it will never be the same for long since they have rolling map changes every so many hours. During the game you also get to unlock new abilities and power-ups as you go, which is nice and the challenges to get them are a quirky little twist.Overall, great little game that brings out a side of me i never knew i had while gaming. Lots of frustrated laughs ... which is good... so yeah.			"

												Race The Sun reminds me a lot of games like Jetpack Joyride and Cube Runner. It takes the endless runner aspects of both games and also uses the mission mechanic that makes Jetpack Joyride so addicting. I constantly found myself saying just one more run when I knew I was close to finally finishing a mission. Unlocking new things with each level that I gained kept me involved and wanting to keep gettting those missions done. The level creator is exceedingly thorough but with no real way to share levels yet, I eagerly await Steam Workshop, in the mean time the editor is simply a nice gesture. The visual style is simple yet pleasing and I loved visiting new worlds just to see what was in store for me. At the end of the day, if you loved Jetpack Joyride or are looking for a great game to play while waiting for friends to go play multiplayer with then this is for you and, heck, even if you don't fit those catagories you should still check the game out.

												Race the Sun is a combination of those ""just one more round""-games and the ""zen-like but still frustrating""-games (like Tetris on high difficulty). It's basically an infinite runner, as long as you don't run out of solar power. Your speed is constant to the amount of solar power you have. You dodge stuff, jump if you find power ups, collect tris's (diamonds) and try to get as far as possible without crashing... all to the sway of a great soundtrack. If you crash you start all over again. There's only one track (if you don't count what you can found in the Steam Workshop) but it's regenerated every 24 hrs so you can always come back for more.At the same time there's a level up system. Every five rewardpoints you collect you'll get a level up which gives you minor bonuses. You collect rewardpoints by completing tasks. At any point you have three tasks; a one pointer, a two pointer and a three pointer. These can range anywhere from ""collectively travel X amount of distance"" to ""clear two stages without ever turning left"". Once you complete a task it is swapped for a new one... and this system gives the game some more depth. Instead of always just trying to get as far as possible, you start trying to complete tasks... kinda like achievement hunting, but you're actually rewarded for completing them ... other than a small icon that pops up.Awesome game - recommended fullheartedly!

The progression system is well put together and progression feels quick while you aren't feeling rushed through the game. The game play is quick, smoot and easy to get the hang of, but mastery takes time and learning of how things work and how maps are layed out. The different types of maps and daily layout changes gives this game a lasting appeal as well as an appocalypse mode which is very difficult but fun. Overall a fun little game that will entertain you for a decent amount of time.9/10			"

												Love this god dam game. I  just got it today and i LOVE IT!! it is a racing/dodging game. It is very fast and you might find yourself crashing alot at the start!! The pros: Fun, fast, its quite cheap for £6.99 ( i got it for £2.09) Cons: Can get repetitive. It is very fun but once you have mastered the level you have to wait 24 hours for the map to be different. I still reconmend this game to anone who want to buy it!			"

												Race the Sun is a easy to understand, easy to play but still very fun minigame. Although it's so simple there are different stages that get difficulter the further you get. It's a small but still challenging minigame that never gets boring. Besides trying to reach your highscore and getting to the best stage you can there are upgrades you can apply to your ship to make gameplay more interesting and varied. All together I conclude it's worth the money if you wanna have a small but fun game to play sometimes.			"

												So, this is a game with no stunning graphics, but people love it anyways. The concept is awesome. Its the best unexplained background story of a game ever. No one knows why youre rushing towards the sun with your solar powered aircraft, but everyone wants to do it. You will scream. In joy, after dodging a object, in rage after rushing into another while doing this. This game never gets old. Its the same conept every time, yes, but every day, the world you pla y...gets resetted. New challenges, new booster places, new objects to smash your aircraft into.With the Apocalypse mode a real...wait, no, this game is a real challenge- a greater challnge awaits you. A meteorite landed and♥♥♥♥♥♥is going down. How far can you get while the world is going down around you?(User featured world are comming soon to, lets see what awesome people will create.)EDIT: User featured worlds are live since a while and so far, pretty awesome stuff was created. One more reason to spend the money for this awesome game.After all: This game is worth the small amount of cash. An everyday new challenge, and a awesome unexplained background story. Graphics 9/10 Yeah, 9 because of the way the sun was managed and the apocalypse mode.Gameplay 9/10 Its not really any sort of gameplay, unexlained background story and stuff, so ""only"" 9Music 10/10 Situation fitting music. Its fits the  region you are in. Sunset changes the music, different for Apocalypse too.All in all 9/10 This game is simply awesome			"

												        First off, think of Race The Sun as a mobile game, but magnified onto a larger screen. There is no story, no dialogue: just the simple objective of don't die. That includes getting as far as you can while the sun is still up, as you are a solar powered aircraft (hence the title, Race the Sun). So pretty much it's a time trial, except instead of numbers on a timer, it's a natural time limit. Controls are intuitive and simple, like many other platformers. As you progress in the game you'll get more abilites and things to collect while dodging huge rotating boxes and manoeuvring through narrow tunnels. There is also a level designer, although that was too complex for me to figure out how to use, and I decided just racing would be a better use of my time.         Overall, this is a fun, action packed platformer with beautiful minimalist graphics that brings a new dynamic of racing the Sun until it sets. Highly recommended, but not for its price. I bought it for $2 while it was on sale, and for that it is more than worth it. However, $10 might be a little on the pricey side for a game with its amount of content.          Regardless of the price, I rate it 8/10 for what it is.			"

												To hear our full review of Race the Sun, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]Race the Sun is a fun, simple, endless runner where you pilot a solar-powered hovercraft. You have to dodge obstacles while collecting power ups and keeping pace with the sun so as to maintain power. Besides trying to rise in the leaderboards, there are objectives to complete (such as making it to a certain distance, spending an amount of time airborne, doing a bunch of barrel rolls without crashing, etc.) that keep the game interesting. Beating these objectives levels you up and lets you get new power ups and upgrades. Additionally, the developers upload a new level every 24 hours, so there is always a new challenge. The game also includes a fairly robust level editor that allows users to create and share their own levels. Some of these levels can be accessed by portals found within the developer levels.All of this leads to an experience that is engaging, challenging, and very rewarding, despite a total lack of story and the very simple graphics and sound. Overall, we definitely recommend playing the game if you want an arcade type of experience that still offers new challenges after many hours of play.			"

												For all the grand adventures and intricate experiences that video games have to offer nowadays, sometimes it’s the older and simpler ideas that stick in the mind the most. You may share similar memories to me; ones of heading to websites such as Miniclip, and playing those little games which consisted of dodging and weaving a spaceship round the many blocks and obstacles that came hurtling in your direction. It was good, clean fun. Well, Race the Sun doesn’t really try and disguise the fact that at its core it’s basically offering more of the same. Still, that’s not a bad thing – the concept remains fun even today, whether you are wearing the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia or not.  It continues to be satisfying to watch your score go up and up as you expertly weave your way through the narrowest of gaps, all the while experiencing that jolt in your stomach as you brush far too close to your death. Even when you inevitably turn into a fine mist, the feeling you can always do better compels you to hit that restart button and so through the whole process again. Race The Sun manages to easily pull all those emotions out of you, but goes on to amplify them via the added spice of challenging you to stay one step ahead of a setting sun, all via the means of collecting certain power –ups and staying out of the shadows. This makes it so you have to be taking more risks if you want to survive for any extended period of time, meaning those exciting near death moments come at such a rapid pace it certainly keeps the blood pumping. It’s a cool little mechanic.That’s not the only thing different that Race the Sun adds to the table, either. There’s also a list of challenges to complete, varying from reaching certain distances to performing a number of risky manoeuvres, where success slowly levels you up. With new levels come new power-ups or the means to improve your high scores, and then the cycle beings anew. The fact the game generates a new world to try every day is another nice feature – each generated landscape sticks around long enough to give you a good amount of time to truly master it, but not long enough for things to get ever get stale. None of these ideas are mind-blowing, I concur, but they’re enough to keep you coming back to the game once the appeal of high score chasing wears thin. With Steam Workshop additionally seeing people generate some truly crazy levels, the game’s lifespan extends far beyond when you’d probably initially expect. Things aren’t entirely perfect, mind you. Some of those aforementioned challenges the game throws up at you feel blatantly more difficult when compared to the rest, and a bunch of the rewards you’ll get for completing them are basically inferior compared to those that you unlocked many a level ago. While not frequent in the slightest, I’ve also had a few occasions where I’ve encountered a death which felt downright unfair  – either I’ve suddenly found myself flying at an impenetrable wall of stone, or power-ups don’t appear anywhere near the frequency you need them to in order to viably stay alive. The menus also achieve something remarkable in the sense they’re both very basic and oddly confusing – the ability to customise your ship’s wings is not advertised very well, for instance, and I’ve had moments where joypad button prompts kept popping up even though I was using a keyboard and mouse. The fact you can’t restart after dying if using a joypad (forcing you to reach over and do it with your mouse) is also something that may seem tiny, but becomes so incredibly frustrating over extended play it’s impossible to ignore.  The question that perhaps sprung into your mind at the start of this review, of course, is why you should be buying this game when I’ve highlighted there’s so many free alternatives online. It’s a fair enough question... But in response, I would state that Race the Sun does things so well, and implements its own ideas in a way that keeps you truly interested, that I honestly think it’s worth your time and money. I was pleasantly surprised by how much entertainment I got out of it, and I think you will be too. Just don’t go beating my scores. "

												Great little game to past the time.But be careful, it can become addictive.The soundtrack is awesome, but the graphics are minamilistic, however that adds to the charm I find.Your are racing the sun in your glider trying to get as far as you can before the sun sets on you.Power-ups can help you reverse time, which rises the sun higher, as well as speed boosts and jumps, to name a few.The fun part about this game is, it is a different board every day. You can even create your own boards.Unlike other glider/racer type games, you have freedom to move and take new directions.By being able to roam, you can find Portals that will take you to other boards.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												!!! FLY ON THE WINGS OF LOVE !!!RTS is an arcade-styled perma-death survival game that surprisingly doubles up as a chill-out game. Smooth, minimal graphics with very simple gameplay and tight controls, make it extremely enjoyable and replayable. I got this not long back for my Vita when it was on sale via PSN, and added it to my Steam wishlist after enjoying it so much. I have to say, the Steam version is a tad better - obviously a bigger screen goes without saying, but it comes with more envirionmental changes, play-styles, DLC, trading cards and achievements. Definitely worth it on a 70% (or more) off sale, and even though I enjoy the PC version a little more, the Vita version is still worth picking up - this game works very well as a hand-held.			"

												Race the Sun is brilliant.  Its like having an arcade cabinet in your computer,   I wish i could take a dollar to the bar and get quarters to play this game with a beer on the stool beside me.  The most astonishing thing about race the sun is that the world changes, sometimes subtly and sometimes radically, every 24 hours.  I have no idea how this is accomplished, but it somehow heightens the old school nature of the game, and would have been an incredible feature in an arcade in the late eighties.  For some reason it also reminds me of pinball.  It is Adams Family good.			"

												I purchased this game not long ago during a sale, and on a whim. I'm not a huge arcade game fan, nor have I ever spent any decent amount of time in any ""flying racing"" game. What attracted me to this was its simplistic design. It's an absolutely beautiful game even though it took about a minute to download in full (seriously!). I also thought it was an original idea, and the procedural world thing also pulled at me.So, despite never having been a fan of this type of game in the past, I have to say, I'm loving this. The music is top notch, the worlds are beautiful and change daily, and it truly makes you feel like you're on a mission (a mission to what? RACE THE SUN! **Crickets**). I picked this game out of my Steam backlog because I felt like something simple and relaxing, and oddly enough, this game does that for me. This game is what you allow it to be, really. You can play it just to waste time and relax, or you can try beating your top scores and accomplishing certain tasks the game consistently updates for you to do that help you level (much like the awesometacular game Jetpack Joyride for the PS Vita does).Race the Sun has a seriously high ""just one more level"" aspect, and the way it presents itself in terms of leveling, tasks to do, etc., open it up for a wider audience than just the ""arcade racing"" crowd. 90% of the time, I don't want to feel stressed or on edge when I'm gaming, which is what most arcade games do to me. In Race the Sun, I'm not on edge, because even if I have a run that sucks, I still have fun, can laugh at my mistakes, and may even accomplish some progress on my level.On a final note, there is massive replay value here. The game worlds change daily, and it allows you to even mess with its editor to create content for yourself. You can also customize your ship and unlock upgrades, which will take a while to get all of. I highly recommend this game to those who already like the genres it inhabits, but also to those looking for a great game that is fun to jump in and out of, to relax or challenge yourself. Race the Sun is a great game, and gets everything it does right.			"

												It's simple. Fun and quite addicting. The title pratically states what this game is going to be about. Not only that but with workshop compability. Unique and challenging maps are created for gamers to race on. (Note this isn't a racing game with other players or bots if you got that impression).You should honestly have no trouble playing this game. It's not stressful, or has this horror game element. It's just one of those kick back and relax games. The only thing i will suggest is rebinding the movement keys from the direction keys to the W,A,S,D keys. But honestly by the fifth or tenth run on the same map (that is ever changing, thanks to the active development team). You won't have to rebind the keys to remember what is in front of you.If you want simple and enjoyable games. Then i recommend this one.			"

												I'm going to dissent. At the time of writing, 95% of reviewers have recommended this game. I won't.It is a minimalist racing game that tests the reflexes. It is well done within its context. It is hard to find fault in what is implemented.The issue is, well, what is implemented amounts to not-very-much. I played it a few times after buying it, and haven't touched it since nor had any inclination to. Once you've played it a few times then that's it, you've exhausted the variety of the game - there's nothing left to discover other than how far you can get into the game. You'll never uncover anything new in terms of the gameplay. You just might see a few more types of object to dodge.Sure, the layout of each level changes every 24 hours. Sure, some people have created quite a variety of levels in the workshop. However, it all boils down to the same very simple game - dodge until you die. It's really a mini-game and as such I can't recommend it as a £6.99 (or ~$10) purchase.			"

												Race the Sun is a minimalist endless runner where you fly a solar powered ship towards the sun until you crash or the sun sets. You have challenges and level up in much the same way as other popular endless runners (e.g. Jetpack Joyride), but there are no microtransactions or ads in this PC game. It's a lot of fun, and addictive, kind of reminiscent of the original Star Fox in visuals. The game lacks polish in several noticeable areas (one of them being that my score usually doesn't get added to the leaderboard).			"

												What you are trying to accomplish in this game is simple: Just go as long and as far as you can, without crashing or running out of energy, both get increasingly harder as the Game progresses. You can keep going on battery for a short time, but you are basically a solar powered glider racing towards the sun. The longer you go the deeper the sun will sink, shadows of obstacles will grow longer and harder to avoid, which will slow you down or even stop you, all while obstacles get more plentiful and trickier to navigate around as the game progresses.One of it's main features is that the scoreboard and the map are reset every 24/h, which keeps it fresh and it's a great way of making exploiting kind of pointless. The leveling system is kind of interesting, but very linear and one-dimensional.Overall it's a stylish little game. It's great fun and optimal to pull out for 5 minutes every now and then.			"

												In Race The Sun, you fly a solar powered hovercraft through an obstacle course, while the sun descends the sky. Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible to earn a high score. The course is divided into regions, which start off fairly relaxed as you fly through wide open spaces and around static objects, but gets progressively more intense as you squeeze through narrow gaps and make split second reactions to avoid moving objects. The race ends either when you crash, or run out of sunlight.Along the way you can collect various pickups. Blues increase your score, greens let you jump over obstacles, yellows give a speed boost and increase remaining sun time and purples allow you to respawn one time after a crash.During a race you can also work towards completing challenges such as collecting x number of pickups or earning a specific score. Every few challenges completed will grant you a level up and unlock a new pickup, or an item to equip on your craft. These items grant useful abilities, for example, the magnet will attract nearby pickups, and the jump storage lets you carry two jump pickups instead of one. But you have limited item slots, so your choice can influence your playing style. The map is procedurally generated every 24 hours, which means success depends more on skill than memorising the map. It also helps to keep the game fresh. Graphics are minimal, but that's actually a good thing. When you're flying at such high speeds, more detail would be distracting. Controls work well with either keyboard or 360 pad. I haven't noticed any bugs or crashes.Race The Sun is a simple concept with excellent execution, and it can be really fun when played in short sessions. I currently have logged 78 hours on Audiosurf and 29 hours on Aaaaa playing half an hour at a time, and I can see myself doing similar with Race The Sun.I definitely recommend checking this game out, and with such a low purchase price, there's no need to wait for a sale.

												Highly addictive, This game will have you saying, ""Just one more try!..."" Fly your way through regions filled with obstacles and buildings as you race against the sun in your solar powered... uh, hover plane I guess I'll call it. Pick up powerups that reverse the sun and offer you more time to fly, cause when the sun does finally set, It's game over.(Funny how they have the technology to build a solar panel ship, but not a battery for night, lol) Leveling up will unlock more add-ons for your ship, like magnets that make pickups easier to grab, jump storage that offers an extra jump you can hold on to and lots more as you level up. Controller friendly options also offer a more suitable playing experience for some users although you can use the keyboard too, I found the contoller to be more suitable to my liking. There are also leaderboards so be prepared to challenge your friends for Highscores! I'm battling my friends already. Great game to pass the time and easy to learn, I will reccomend this game to any gamer out there that enjoys a good challenge!			"

												This game is a four letter word, namely ♥♥♥♥!or maybe a divine word and a four letter word, such as HOLY ♥♥♥♥!In otherwords.....  this game is simply amazing.  It also might give you a heart attack, or make you feel all giggity on the inside, butterflies in the stomach and such.  That's the effect I'm getting right now; something between that and the heart-pounding fight or flight adrenaline rush of a century (a lil hyperbole there).You fly in the smoothest riding, touchiest to control aircraft in the universe cruising at lightning speed.  Every crash brings both a sense of dread and elation!  After awhile, crashing becomes insanely fun, actually!  In this game, unlike sex, lasting 3 minutes is a good thing!  What feels even more good than the ejaculatory experience of exploding into objects with your 'aircraft' is the experience of weaving impossibly through obstacles, or richocheting off of them to extreme heights only to be thrown down into a chaotically destructive maze of impossibility.  BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥  It's also similar to Super Hexagon and I thought it would be useful to compare the two, since I am so in love with that game as well, so.....THE BREAKDOWN:  (Comparison of Race the Sun and Super Hexagon)On the annoying scale: I would rank it slightly under SuperHexagon which is a game that should also be in your library if you end up being into this game, or if you haven't already bought it.... SH, as it stands is the most annoying/frustrating game of all time.  RtS: 8 , SH: 10Challenge/Difficulty:  I would have to say about the same thing here, but it's a close match.  RtS: 9, SH: 10Fun Factor:  BOTH 10's!Visual Appeal:  This is where Race the Sun takes the lead, with a score that is relative to this type of very minimalist arcade game:  RtS: 10, SH: 8Music Annoyingness: 10 - 10Mind-♥♥♥♥ing Awesomeness:  10-10			"

												I don't normally care for runner games unless they do something to keep me invested. A lot of them now have levels to earn and missions to do and unlocks to... unlock, and Race the Sun is no different. But even after unlocking everything, I still go back to it now and then because of how solid the basic gameplay is.You're the pilot of a solar-powered hovercraft, speeding towards the setting sun in an attempt to stay in daylight. Shadows cast by mountains, structures, and clouds will all slow you down, and when the sun sets, you're done. To keep up with the sun you'll need to dodge the many obstacles in your wide-open path, as well as pick up booster items to thrust you forward at even higher speed. I wasn't kidding about speeding towards the sun, because even your regular pace feels like hundreds of miles per hour. Dodging obstacles and steering into pickups is thrilling and harrowing, and pulling off tight maneuvers is always satisfying.There are all manner of items to pick up across the levels like point multipliers, jumps, shields, and more. Completing tasks like clearing 3 levels without bumping anything or jumping 5 times earns you XP towards new ranks, which unlock upgrades and decals for your ship. There are 25 ranks to earn, giving you a goal for at least a few hours. Even beyond that there are reasons to keep flying, though. The main levels change every day, giving you new layouts to tackle. There's also a hard mode and a maze mode to unlock, and user-created levels to try, including one user-created level hidden in the regular game each day!The presentation is a unique blend of stark, clean visuals, soothing soundtrack, and a strangely casual tone to the text. All the elements are there for a game that you can load up for 5 or 10 minutes for a quick run, or turn on for an hour and work at, or start the free-flight mode and just chill. There's no fighting so it won't properly scratch that Starfox itch you might get from the screenshots, but it's well worth a few hours of your time to explore and enjoy.			"

Until the next day, you're stuck playing the same level over and over again, and nothing changes until the map updates.			"

You can actually feel the wind as you play. Try and make a long curve and you'll know what I'm talking about. The obstacles move in such a crazy way you get vertigo feelings trying to avoid those damn moving blocks!The soundtrack, simple as it is, provides an immersive experience as you get speed, and the clean background keeps you playing for hours until you realize it's past time to go to sleep.Buy this game, even if it's not in sale.

												Glrofied Smartphone AppThis isn't really racing, it's more of a ""slide left and right to grab powerups and avoid obstacles"" game. The graphics are blocky, there are zero textures, and for the entire level you stare into the sun (a bright white spot on your screen). I've found nearly identical gameplay and better graphics in titles on my Android phone, with a normal timer instead of the irritating sun gimmick.Bleh. This is uninspiring design and really not worth your money. You can probably pick it up as part of a bundle if you really want to try it.			"

												Just the sort of game you can download, keep around, and come back to whenever you find yourself with some free time. It took me a little while to reach the max player level of 25, but even once I achieved it the game lost no luster. The world resets every 24 hours to ensure a constantly new and exciting run. This is, of course, in addition to the workshop feature that allows you to instantly play any fan-made levels (or even create your own). I've found few games to be so rewarding as far as replay value and I highly recommend this one. Five Stars.			"

												Race The Sun boils every racing game down to the core game play mechanic: move fast and avoid stuff. In this game, you move very fast, and try hard to avoid what can only really be described as ""stuff"". Despite its unique aspects, this game sits in a familiar groove.It shouldn't be called Race the Sun, it should be called Chase the Sun, and it shouldn't be called that, it should be called Chase Your Old Record, because the titular Sun is nothing but a countdown timer. This source of mild frustration of a Sun gradually sets over the horizon, and since your birdplanewhatsit is solar powered, this is not something you want. However, the Sun will set, and your fun will grind to a halt, giving you just enough time to consider the merits of some kind of battery before you're back to round 1 again. There are yellow glassy starry somethings that you can pick up (smash into) which put a bit of time back on the clock, but not much.Still, it's a fun game. There's a level-up system based on achievements, which unlock modifications and power-ups. These let you Chase Your Old Record for a little longer. Ignore the videos and screenshots, they misrepresent the game. Chase Your Old Record is not pretty by design, it's very stark and monochromatic. You'll spend no time looking at those interesting shapes as they whizz by, and nothing will surprise you after about half an hour. Get out your controller (keyboard sucks for this game), put on your headphones, slip into the zone, and spend some time travelling blindingly fast.			"

												Really, really love this game.  I saw it and was like ""Ehh, this could be a fun game to kill some spare time and what not...""  Now I constantly find myself wanting to play all the time.Very fast-paced, very addicting, and incredibly well-done for the community.  The visuals are really neat, and the mechanic of the maps changing every 24 hours is just amazing.  It keeps the game alive, and you'll always want to go back and see the new map.  And with community-made maps in the workshop, there's even more fresh life in this pretty much never-ending game.The only complaint I have about it so far is that when using the keyboard arrow keys, the game becomes a little impossible; the turns become sharper, resulting in a lot of crashing into obstacles and a bit of rage.  It's much easier to play with a controller, which allows you to make softer turns when needed.  I dunno, that just might be me...But still, very fun game.  Definitely money well-spent.			"

												A simple game to pick up, yet one that is hard to master: move your solar ship left and right to dodge obstacles, trying to clear each region before the sun sets. The replayablity comes from the insane speed that your craft flies at and the countless times that you will die. However, with each death you will have become slighlty more adept at dodging the numerous obstacles, creeping towards the final region...			"

												Race The Sun is a simple game that I enjoyed a lot. The game itself is hard to describe, at its most basic I would say it comes down to a race against time/ dodging obstacles. Besides the fast paced gameplay, where Race the Sun excels is its ambiance and environment. they are simplistic but memorable providing a relaxing atmosphere even amongst the fast speed and reflex testing gameplay. To top it off not only are there multiple modes in Race the Sun, the game comes with a detailed level/world editor for custom content. This is always a plus when user generated content can be made, extending the lifespan of a game considerably. Overall I would recommend this game to fans of indie games, racing games, or even rhythm games like super hexagon.			"

												Wanted this game because I used to love the flash game 'Jet Slalom', and was not disappointed. Worlds regenerate every day, so it's fresh when you go back to it and it has Steam Workshop support so there should be plenty of new content coming out. The only (inevitable) problem with this type of game is once you level up all the way and the 'challenges' end, it's not quite as fun/addicting to play. Still great for going for high scores, but the replayability does drop off some. Still an excellent game to get for a few bucks.			"

Race The Sun is awesome.I originally bought this game on a whim, during one of the numerous Steam sales. It looked like a great concept, new and original, and that really appealed to me.I really love how this game can be so versatile. It can be a casual 5-minute game, or a highly competitive hierarchy of hundreds of players scrambling over each other to be the one at the top.Being a relatively new game, the leaderboards are free of the burden of hackers (or the ten digit score numbers that point towards one), but that also means that the game has multiple bugs.Lighting is the one that stands out to me. The game is based around a craft speeding towards the setting sun in a desperate and inevitably vain attempt to escape the oncoming darkness and the oblivion coming with it. You have to stay out of the shadows cast by obstacles, or your solar energy will deplete and you will slow down. This usually has no problem, but I've noticed that when passing by multiple obstacles in quick sucession (Like if you have a x26 multiplier), the shadows (or at least, their affect on your batteries) seem to trip up and not work sometimes.However, like I said, this is a very new game, and these types of things are to be expected. In fact, I've been pleasently surprised by the lack of bugs and glitches, and the amount of patches and fixes.Lighting is a very tricky thing to manage, though, especially while keeping FPS in mind, and I don't mind it at all.Overall, out of ten, I give this game a nine.That's a 9/10, or an A-, if this were a test.To be fair, I almost never give out anything above.So what are you waiting for? Steal Borrow your parent's wallet, and run down to the confusing bazaar of games that is the Steam Store, and buy a copy for yourselves!You won't regret it!			"

Admittedly, my desire to play incessantly dropped off a bit, but then it went on sale on the Humble store so I picked it up on PC as well.

												Gameplay is simple but challenging and the visuals are stylish but downright minimalistic. Both of them do get more interesting as the content is slowly unlocked by gaining levels and upgrades through completing tasks. Practically no threshold for picking up and starting a session but a bit harder to put down. :)The game itself loves a controller but for some reason the menus don't. I just grab the mouse for managing upgrades. Also, not too crazy about the audio side of things. The music and pickup sounds get too repetitive although the motor, airflow and crashing sounds are pleasant.Just put on your music of choice, leave your brain at the door, relax and cruise on your reflexes.

Received free copy.TL;DR: I recommend this game but only on sale, there's just not enough here to be worth $9.99 plus $1.99 for DLC that really should've been part of the base game.[Difficulty - average]: It can be easy or hard depending on your ship configuration, memorizing abilty and reflexes.[Controls - good]: You have turn left, turn right, and use special ability... pretty simple to understand.[Music - good]: It's not too distracting but manages to create an atmosphere that fits with racing a setting sun. Or you can just turn it off and use your own music of choice which is always a plus for games.[Graphics - good]: It's simple and smooth which is a plus when reflexes are important to playing at high speeds and any framerate drop or stuttering could spell death. I hate graphic dependant games since they're too much for my older computer, luckily there's no issue at all with this game so just about anyone can play it.[Content - average]: As I said at the top, there isn't much to do in this game and that's mainly because it's all hidden behind unlock requirements which can take awhile to actually unlock. You can only have one ship attachment at the beginning and I have no idea how long it takes to actually get to the point where you can have multiple ones equipped. I'm still at the point where I have 2 choices for levels, the base mode that has a set level that changes every 24 hours or Apocalypse mode which is the base mode with more explosions. Credits mode doesn't count because you can literally afk while doing it because all you do is fly straight and wait for it to end. (Why they didn't have you interact with them by having you dodge falling credits seems like a huge waste). It does have a map editor which adds some feeling of community to it but again you have no choices for level selection beyond what is randomly generated each day.Then you have the Sunrise DLC which is a freestyle zen mode from what I understand of the description. (Why on earth that wasn't included in the basic game which was already lacking in stuff to do is also beyond me).[Overall - good]: Despite the complaints I have for the content, this game is a good time-killer. The built-in games a computer OS comes with (think Solitaire, Minesweeper, or Pinball) are probably the most played games just because you don't always have the time or motivation to commit to a whole game that could take hours to complete.  This game fits into that category of games very well. However it is simply not worth the $12 price tag for it and the Sunrise DLC, between $5 and $8 is closer to what this game should be at.			"

												Fun game that reminds a lot of oldschool racing and/or evading games which focused on high-score and endurance.Think Super-Hexagon, but less insane (at least in the beggining) and, of course, in a 3D world.Guaranteed that you will have some ""Oh, God!"" moments.There are unlockables and some customization (decals, abilities, etc), Some unlockables involve powerups (pickups inside the game) and other things that change gameplay, like enabling speed boost powerups or a jump powerup that you may use whenever you want on that round.Also, it seems that every 24h the game levels get randomized, which means every different day you play will guarantee a new experience. Very interesting concept.			"

												I thought i would never reach second level, at most 10th. But now i'm on 20th and i'm confident i can reach more. This is a simple game to play with your nerves. Flying on a high velocity trying to avoid obstacles. At first it seems you can't make it. But it has nice difficulty curve. There are always 3 objectives to complete and you can complete them ALL, just might need some time to upgrade for some of them. And you get better at controlling the plane as time goes (playing with keyboard though, gamepad lags a bit). Another big plus, that every day it looks differently (don't know if they do it manually or levels generate procedururally). They have similarities and are composed of same objects, but still have some unique spots, so you want to check it out next day. And there are users generated levels also.			"

												Race the Sun is a Endless Runner type Indie game. It is Fast paced and gets Faster as the game goes on the goal is to Race The Sun and not Die, you can do this by picking up yellow ""Boosters"" to reverse the setting of the sun for a small moment, go through ""Portals"" to skip the current region, You can Pick up ""Jump"" powerups to jump over obstacle in your way (you can do this by pressing Space by default) and also by picking up shield powerups to give you a ""Shield"" for when you hit an obstacle.This is also a Leaderboard based game so you score by just racing, but you increase your multiplier by picking up ""Tris"" every 5 Tris ups your multplier by 1x.You also have mini objective to complete and in doing so you get either 1/2/3 Points after a set about of points you unlock stuff like powerups to equip on your ship there is stuff like ""Magnet"" to increase your pickup range of tris and powerups, and ""Jump Storage"" so you can hold more than 1 Jump at a time, and there is also decals you can put on your wins (you unlock the left wing decals first then later the Right wing decals).There is also an apocalypse gamemode you unlock I haven't played much of it but it is a lot crazier than the normal game modeMy over all rating for this game is 8.5/10It does start off slow, it can be a tiny bit annoying at times (but that's just me)but over all it is verry verry fun and I play it 10+ times almost every day			"

												Race The Sun--------------Race The Sun is an excellent game to play especially when you're bored. You could spend around 5 minutes to hours on end having a blast. The great thing about Race The Sun is when you go through obstacles and improving skills. It's fun to also download maps and try new quests on everything. Even the Music is really nice too; It suits the game well and even at the drops in the music, it makes you want to move along with it when trying to dodge obstacles or just go along when you're in a wide open space. Another great thing is it is a game that has achievements! That can also make you work keep working hard to get those achievements. You can even create your own 'Race the Sun' Map :D That makes it even more entertaining and more fun for hours on end. It gives a challenge to players to who are thinking about the future and maybe do this for a living? Working on coding, creating the map, moving around all objects, the possibilites are endless.So go on and buy Race The Sun!			"

												Race The Sun boils every racing game down to the core game play mechanic: move fast and avoid stuff. In this game, you move very fast, and try hard to avoid what can only really be described as ""stuff"". Despite its unique aspects, this game sits in a familiar groove.It shouldn't be called Race the Sun, it should be called Chase the Sun, and it shouldn't be called that, it should be called Chase Your Old Record, because the titular Sun is nothing but a countdown timer. This source of mild frustration of a Sun gradually sets over the horizon, and since your birdplanewhatsit is solar powered, this is not something you want. However, the Sun will set, and your fun will grind to a halt, giving you just enough time to consider the merits of some kind of battery before you're back to round 1 again. There are yellow glassy starry somethings that you can pick up (smash into) which put a bit of time back on the clock, but not much.Still, it's a fun game. There's a level-up system based on achievements, which unlock modifications and power-ups. These let you Chase Your Old Record for a little longer. Ignore the videos and screenshots, they misrepresent the game. Chase Your Old Record is not pretty by design, it's very stark and monochromatic. You'll spend no time looking at those interesting shapes as they whizz by, and nothing will surprise you after about half an hour. Get out your controller (keyboard sucks for this game), put on your headphones, slip into the zone, and spend some time travelling blindingly fast.			"

												This game is fast, and when I mean fast, I mean ""HOLY S@^%!"" fast. You'll be focusing so much that you don't want to look away for just a second in this game. Is it good? Yes, the game is fast paced and it's not really repetitive. The reason for that is because you can choose which path to go, and that adds a whole new level of depth to the game. Go right, it's a new area. Go left, it's another new area. Continue straight, it's a completely different area. In other words, wherever you go, you'll meet different obstacles which keeps the game fresh and exciting. So far I can only get to stage 4, but that proves how hard this game can get :)			"

												Bare, rustic and brutal, your only goal is to struggle stay under the embrace of the sun. Darkness is your funeral, as light your only source of energy which propels you forward. You do not have any other option, another other direction to go apart from chasing the sun. Having it out of your sight is your greatest fear, though it will eventually come, unforgivingly yet certainly. Race-the-sun is an extremely simple yet dystopic racing game. There are only 3 controls you, moving left or right, and space propels you up into the air if you have the power-up. Your aim is to avoid crashing into anything near you before your time is up. There is no way out, and there will definitely be a time where you either crash, or the sun sets right in your eyes as darkness consumes you in your funeral. Doesn't matter, as a part of the game mechanism is to retry and improve on your score.			"

												This game reminds me of 3D death chase on the ZX-Spectrum. However, as none of you are old enough to remember than I best elaborate. This game is a basically a racing / dodging game, you are trying to race the sun in your solar power vehicle. The sun is setting in the distance, casting shadows on the scenery in your way. The lower the sun, the longer the shadows, and whilst your vehicle is powered by the sun, entering the shadows = slower speed. This itself might be an advantage as the game runs along at a hell of a pace and thou' early levels you will dodgy the scenery with ease, later levels it gets MUCH more difficult. If the sun sets, it's game over, if you hit the scenery (most likely) its game over. Along the way there are power ups to collect, some increase your score multiplier, some buy you a bit more time, some offer you a shield, some offer a jump facility (usually good for getting out of trouble). The maps are randomly generated, there are ""objectives"" that help you raise the level of your craft which gives you various additional perks. The genius of this game is the maps are randomly generated every 24 hours!. So today's level/game is nothing like yesterdays and wont be the same tomorrow.   The random maps are the same for everybody (if that makes sense, so yes the map is random, but someone playing on the same day as you has the same level). There is a learning curve; however, with repeated attempts you do get better and progress. It's good for a quick blast. A 20 minute filler game, which is different everytime you play it (so long as you play it on different days) :D "

												Gameplay is simple but challenging and the visuals are stylish but downright minimalistic. Both of them do get more interesting as the content is slowly unlocked by gaining levels and upgrades through completing tasks. Practically no threshold for picking up and starting a session but a bit harder to put down. :)The game itself loves a controller but for some reason the menus don't. I just grab the mouse for managing upgrades. Also, not too crazy about the audio side of things. The music and pickup sounds get too repetitive although the motor, airflow and crashing sounds are pleasant.Just put on your music of choice, leave your brain at the door, relax and cruise on your reflexes.

												Easy to learn, hard to master... just how a game should be.The courses change every day, giving you a new and interesting problem to solve every day.  I take a small dose of this game with breakfast.  Its controls are simple... so much so that it can played with one hand, leaving your other to shove your breakfast burrito into your face.  But don't let that fool you.  RTS is a game that demands your attention and reflexes, but with great reward.Not very graphically intense, but it's better this way.  Your objective is simple, your controls are simple, and your environment should match, especially given that this is a a fast reflex and short-term planning game.  Complexity would only create more problems in the way of hitbox management and identification.  Immersion, as a result, is minimal yet engaging.Progression can be a bit slow through the ship levels, but if you focus, you can achieve even some of the goals that seem more difficult than the others, resulting in a bigger jump through the leveling process.And then... the unlocked mode.  I won't spoil it, but... Yeah.  Awesome.+1.  Time is running out.			"

Easy controls, increasingly complex gameplay, and utter fear and panic for the entire of a game - which generally lasts under 2 minutes.  Then you do it again.  And again.  And again.			"

												Awesome game. Its a high speed racer where your going faster than you can handle dodging all sorts of walls. As you get to new regions stuff starts moving you get better upgrades and the game gets crazier. Definitley a fun one to play if you want a challange. I bought it on sale for $5.00 and that is what i would pay for it. Not sure if its really worth 10 bucks but it all depends on how you play the game. I personaly got to lvl 25 within a couple of weeks because i spent time enjoying the game and all the level designs. Really cant wait for some new costmized maps to come out.			"

Received free copy.TL;DR: I recommend this game but only on sale, there's just not enough here to be worth $9.99 plus $1.99 for DLC that really should've been part of the base game.[Difficulty - average]: It can be easy or hard depending on your ship configuration, memorizing abilty and reflexes.[Controls - good]: You have turn left, turn right, and use special ability... pretty simple to understand.[Music - good]: It's not too distracting but manages to create an atmosphere that fits with racing a setting sun. Or you can just turn it off and use your own music of choice which is always a plus for games.[Graphics - good]: It's simple and smooth which is a plus when reflexes are important to playing at high speeds and any framerate drop or stuttering could spell death. I hate graphic dependant games since they're too much for my older computer, luckily there's no issue at all with this game so just about anyone can play it.[Content - average]: As I said at the top, there isn't much to do in this game and that's mainly because it's all hidden behind unlock requirements which can take awhile to actually unlock. You can only have one ship attachment at the beginning and I have no idea how long it takes to actually get to the point where you can have multiple ones equipped. I'm still at the point where I have 2 choices for levels, the base mode that has a set level that changes every 24 hours or Apocalypse mode which is the base mode with more explosions. Credits mode doesn't count because you can literally afk while doing it because all you do is fly straight and wait for it to end. (Why they didn't have you interact with them by having you dodge falling credits seems like a huge waste). It does have a map editor which adds some feeling of community to it but again you have no choices for level selection beyond what is randomly generated each day.Then you have the Sunrise DLC which is a freestyle zen mode from what I understand of the description. (Why on earth that wasn't included in the basic game which was already lacking in stuff to do is also beyond me).[Overall - good]: Despite the complaints I have for the content, this game is a good time-killer. The built-in games a computer OS comes with (think Solitaire, Minesweeper, or Pinball) are probably the most played games just because you don't always have the time or motivation to commit to a whole game that could take hours to complete.  This game fits into that category of games very well. However it is simply not worth the $12 price tag for it and the Sunrise DLC, between $5 and $8 is closer to what this game should be at.			"

Gets a lot more entertaining when you hit the level 25 with all the perks and three slots; Before reaching that point, you'll eventually learn a lot about how to handle your speed and handling. Really becomes addictive at one point. You'll just seek more speed to satisfy your hunger. - Loving it so far.Plus, workshop makes it even more fun to play.			"

												Fun game that reminds a lot of oldschool racing and/or evading games which focused on high-score and endurance.Think Super-Hexagon, but less insane (at least in the beggining) and, of course, in a 3D world.Guaranteed that you will have some ""Oh, God!"" moments.There are unlockables and some customization (decals, abilities, etc), Some unlockables involve powerups (pickups inside the game) and other things that change gameplay, like enabling speed boost powerups or a jump powerup that you may use whenever you want on that round.Also, it seems that every 24h the game levels get randomized, which means every different day you play will guarantee a new experience. Very interesting concept.			"

												I thought i would never reach second level, at most 10th. But now i'm on 20th and i'm confident i can reach more. This is a simple game to play with your nerves. Flying on a high velocity trying to avoid obstacles. At first it seems you can't make it. But it has nice difficulty curve. There are always 3 objectives to complete and you can complete them ALL, just might need some time to upgrade for some of them. And you get better at controlling the plane as time goes (playing with keyboard though, gamepad lags a bit). Another big plus, that every day it looks differently (don't know if they do it manually or levels generate procedururally). They have similarities and are composed of same objects, but still have some unique spots, so you want to check it out next day. And there are users generated levels also.			"

												Sense of velocity is excellent, leading to some wonderful ""Ohhhh♥♥♥♥♥♥that was awesome!"" moments. If you're into achievement hunting, you'll find even more in this game as it challenges you to be better and better to get the hardest ones. Replayability is nice, with the course updating with a new random seed every 24 hours, giving you enough time to learn a day's track to improve whilst also keeping you from falling into a routine without skill. Music complements the game nicely, too.This is one of those perfect quick little games you can throw on whilst listening to a podcast or something, requiring only one hand to play (steering left and right, and jumping).

												Cool game that reminds me of an old flash game I used to play. You dodge obstacles as you fly and earn points by collecting ""tris"". The shade is your enemy (you're solar powered) as well as the obstacles causing it, and the setting sun is your time limit. You can add more time though so I assume it's just based on your skill. I like the game and the price is reasonable for the fact that I'm gonna come back to it for years to come. It's a fast paced time waster with some depth for the fact that you can level up and earn upgrades to your ship. The regions you go through are updated every day, and there's gonna be community created regions as well.			"

And I feel like the upgrades and whatnot unlock at a bit of a snail's pace.This game does so much right, but I feel like it tries to extend its replayability simply by getting me to do the same things over and over when I die.  Ultimately that's what leads to my overall negative review.That said, if you really like this sort of game, go for it.  Or if you can pick this up on discount and you sort of like this game, it will probably be worth it under those circumstances, too.			"

The maps are dynamic and change every single day, and to top that off, you can build your own maps and upload them to the workshop or just download the other user made maps. 9/10 In terms of what it is, because it does what it's supposed to, and that's provide with a good time.

												This game is a real wonder. Great soundtrack, really spacy/dreamy sound effects, a real test for your concentration. You guide a small spaceship towards the sunset and you collect shiny diamonds, while trying to avoid shadows and collision. The main objective is to ""stay in the sun"" at all times to go as fast as possible. A real mixture of challenge and zen. Personaly I much prefer these kinds of games than heavier ones.If you like indie games, where you don't have to memorize 20 controls, getting lost in the HUD, ect, and just want to play a game for 10 minutes from now and then, buy this game. It's easy, yet at the same time challenging. It's barebones, yet at the same time fullfilling. And if you like simplistic dreamy landscapes in a race, look no further.			"

												The balls... Ohgodwhy.Race the sun is incredibly simplistic but do not let that fool you. This amazing little thing has a nack to make you want to keep trying, it draws you in because you enjoy playing it while also wanting to stab it for both being patronising and incredibly difficult at times.Minimalistic controls feel tight and really well balanced to the feel of the game and just in general. This is beyond a good thing because the maps have so much substance, changing it up with each new region you fly through. Graphics are quite attractive and with steam workshop being enabled, people's wonderful imaginations run wild and make maps even prettier, also deadlier. Your aircraft I feel as though was modelled off a sparrow, well... You most certainly feel like one by the end of the game and even get a shiny achievement for such!The fast pace of this game makes this a must play for casual, hardcore and all gamers alike.			"

												Title gives away the idea of this game. You pilot a solar powered craft trying to catch the setting sun. You can only try to but you cannot win as the sun will eventually set and you will run out of power.You race in a world that is randomly generated daily so the game offers a lot of replayability. While you can only move towards the sun the map is basically endless in every direction giving you a lot of room to manouver. Completing specific tasks in the game earns powerups that can make you last longer like shield against collisions, jump to avoid obstacles and ability to warp levels. At times the gameplay can be hectic and fast but still i’d say that Race the Sun is most of all a meditative experience. It’s a game that you might play for 10 minutes at a time or so but not much longer. No matter how hard you try the sun will eventually set. It is the journey that holds value.			"

Something about the gameplay made me go crazy.Pros:It becomes more addictive as you continue to playThe maps are very largeThe music really gets youCons:The dificulty of the game is not very balancedIt can get you bored before the ""good part"" of the game even beginsTo sum up: it`s an interesting game with OK graphics that you either hate or love.It is not the average racing game and the colours, lights as well as shadows are ver well placed.I really enjoyed the experience of playing a fun racing game with lots of obstacles and missions, never letting the sun out of your sight.It requieres concentration, fast reflexes and it can be played as long as you want, because you decide when to stop, there is no finish line, just how long you can go avoidding collision.8/10 "

												Race The Sun is a perfect example of why, I love Steam so much.  This is a gem I never would have noticed if it wasn't for the Steam sale.  The game has excellent controls and great music as well.  The graphics are nice and minimal and flying feels fluid and natural.  For 2.99 this game is an absolute steal.  Games like this renew my faith in games in general.  I applaud the developers of this game.  Everyone should check Race The Sun out. Just understand that there is no story or anything like that.  But in my opinon the game doesn't need one.  Race The Sun is great at what it does.  Sometimes less is more. The levels change everyday which increases the replayability greatly.  By all means give this game a shot you won't be dissapointed.			"

You pilot a solar glider over an abstract landscape toward the sun, You need to avoid the various obstacles and you need to avoid shadows, otherwise you glider will eventually lose power. Get through each area before the sun sets or it's ""game over."" Collecting blue pyramids increases your multiplier to increase the points you get for the distance you travel without crashing and dying, or bumping into obstacles, which decrements your multiplier. The game really gives you a sense of speed and you can get to feeling like the obstacles are starting to box you in, which creates a nice tension at times. I saw this game on the Steam Store and thought it looked interesting, but it wasn't until the devs made the game free for a day that I grabbed it. I am glad I did. I ended up buying the DLC to support the devs. Good move, devs!			"

												If you are looking for a slow and complex runner game, it is not here. This game can be very difficult very quickly, but it does everything with polish. Simple, clean, and fast. The trailer really shows the ideas and speed of the game, if you think it's too fast or repetitive then you won't like the game. But I've found it very enjoyable. A slower-speed option could help newer players through the awkward progression system, but the game is still solid.I've never really been a fan of the runner genre, but this game cleans up the issues and polished the best parts. Still, the amount of content is fair, but I don't think the game is incredibly replayable. Most reviewers are around 5 hours or less, with very few above 10. I consider myself nearly ""done"" with the game, seeing most of what the game offers in a reasonable time. It's very good content, but only something I'd come back to play occassionally. I'd recommend waiting for at least 50% off ($4.99).			"

												Amazing game! Reminds me of F-Zero and Star Fox mixed with those old vector graphic tank games. Even though this racer is simple, it is deeper than it seems, both with gameplay and the sarcastic tips. Charming. I am charmed by this game. Music got a bit stale, but it certainly gives you a sense of urgency to race the forever-setting sun.An absolute must play if you're into fast-paced reflex-testers. $10 worth? Maybe... but I got this with the Humble Bundle and I am very happy it was included.			"

												To my surprise I ended up playing this game much more than I first thought. I liked the graphics, they were simple enough to make them not interfere with gameplay. Maybe they could've been a bit more varied with changing colors but not sure if that would've made any difference.To me this reminded of Hotline Miami. Not because of similarity in visuals, but the gameplay: fast, nerve-wracking, lots of deaths and repeats.The games difficulty was very well executed and I for myself found the game manageable. I lost the learning curve at 18 level mark, and then though I cannot get further without grinding lvl 1 challenges which were becoming intensly more dull and longer(Do something 6 times, do something X times).I enjoyed playing this game but thought it lacked many things that could've made it a real deal. The soundtrack of the game is non-existent, only one song which is pretty dull in the end. It works fine as it is, but for this kind of game, I think the game needs an excellent soundtrack to make me want to try it all over again.Also the game could've used some more meat over it's bones. I felt that once you got through the first level, it only becomes more difficult but nothing really changes. Essentially you see most of the games in your first few runs apart from some of the boosters which really are the dullest one can invent. More game modes could've made it more fun with better soundtracks, like endless-mode or something where the sun isn't actually. I know it's the main theme, but allowing one to try just avoiding the increasing amount of objects, without losing speed, could've made me play a few hours more.Also instead of upgrades, I thought this game could've used more boosters, tris and more ships. I think the liberal spreading of boosters and tris would've made the early levels more interesting because one would actively pursue different routes instead of just avoiding stuff. Now the first 3-4 levels can be occasionally be too easy to just surf through without getting anything. Tris are too sparse so if the levels are not scouted properly(previous tries), one has barely a chance to get more than 20 of them per level, decreasing with difficulty. Also since the speed of the craft is so fast, one barely can pursue those that are in the extremes of ones vision unless one knows they are there. More than dozen times I saw something, tried to turn the craft to left or right and just couldn't reach the thing I was trying to get. How disappointing.I think the game relies too much on the fact that player must play same level maybe 10-20 times so that he knows where everything is, yet makes little effort to make it actually enjoyable. Here comes the music part again, that was so well done in Hotline Miami and FTL.All in all this is a fun game and I would recommend this for a try, but I cannot say this will be a great game for everyone. Most might find it dull after few tries. For some it's a game of endless tries and thrills. For me it was a game that lasted few hours but that made me want more. Maybe I'll look into the sequal if it ever comes out.			"

												Race the Sun is a simple concept with a surprising amount of depth.  This game could have been a straight forward survival game were all you had to do was dodge objects and see how long you could survive.  Instead the developers added an excellent mission system to challenge the player to explore and try new things.  The natural growth of your skills combined with a thoughtful quest system makes this a very rewarding experience.The title says it all in this game.  As you fly towards the sun you must avoid the different objects lie in your way.  The father you go the more difficult this becomes; columns with fall over to block your path, balls will rolls into your way, and at times you'll be bottle necked into a tight space.  Not only that but you must keep in the sun light to power your glider.  The sun will slow fall on its own but if you stay in the shade of the objects for too long your battery will start to die and sun will fall much faster than normal.  You'll be motivated to explore to collect Tris to gradually increase your multiplier which is necessary for getting a high-score.Thankfully, you have power-ups and attachments that will help on your journey.  A yellow boost will both increase your speed while simultaneously raising the sun.  The green power-up lets you jump over obstacles were as the purple power-up shields you from a fatal collision.  Over time you'll unlock and level up attachments, some of which let you hold onto multiple power-ups.  Other attachments let you survive longer in the shadows or increase your ability to turn your ship faster.The attachments along with other perks are unlock though the mission system.  At all times there are three tiers of progressively challenging missions.  The first tier is usually so easy its just a matter of time before completing the quest.  The other two tier offers more challenging tasks you'll have to go out of your way for.  These goals range from doing multiple double jumps, flying through multiple zones with no collisions, or building up a really big multiplier.  When you complete a quest you get experience points based on how difficult the challenge is.  Build up enough experience to level up and receive a reward for your hard work.You really feel a wonderful sense of progression playing this game.  Overtime you'll get used to certain obstacles and become more confident with the super tight controls.  Everyday offers a new procedurally generated level.  As soon as you begin to memorize and master one world the next day offers a different layout.  This is great mechanic that keeps the players on their toes while making for an excellent competitive game where you can compete with friends on a daily basis.  For everything this game offers it does a superb job.  Anyone looking for a fun game they can really sink their teeth into I highly recommend Race the Sun.			"

												Don't be fooled by it starting simple - the game builds on itself over and over, rewarding you for playing with new mechanics and customization.The randomized missions required for progression are fun, but unfortunately, the rate you're able to completing them is very slow, many are difficult, and some are bugged - making progress extremely slow as well.  This is futher hampered by the course only changing once a day.  Because of this, I stopped playing well before unlocking the vast majority of the content.Since I got a good amount of value out of it, I would still recommend this game.			"

Race the Sun offers immersive, adrenaline packed experience; yet it's still the kind of game you can jump right into when you just have a few minutes to kill. Now that I think about it, I feel like that is a really rare combo to find in a game, at least for me it is...What is it about? / Gameplay   It's a pretty basic endless runner with an interesting twist. You are controlling an aircraft through obstacle-littered world at high velocity. Being solar-powered, shadows and sunset are your main concern. You must keep going fast enough to delay the inevitable end of your futile race for as long as possible…   The gameplay is very simplistic. Fly, dodge, jump, and collect stuff along the way. That's all I've been doing, because that's all there is to do in this game. Yet, strangely enough, I still find myself craving for more of the same…   The world you're flying through is divided into a regions, each being more difficult, due to rising ammount and variety of obstacles. The whole map is re-generated daily, offering a slightly different experience every day. I say slightly, because some elements always start to appear in the same regions, which I feel is fair. Anyway, the ever changing world keeps the game fresh, and if that's not enough for you, there are another two (unlockable) game modes and a level editor with Steam Workshop support.   The game sets various different challenges -  something like ""collect XY points in one run"" for example. Completing these challenges unlocks new ship upgrades, pick-ups and bunch of other stuff. There are also leaderboards and achievements to make your effort less pointless.Notes   I love how smooth, fluid and responsive the whole game feels. I haven't had a single problem with it. No lag, no framerate drops or bugs. In a fast-paced game, where blinking an eye can get you killed, I certainly do appreciate that.    The sense of speed in this game is insane. I have only played it for 4 hours as I'm writing this, but I know I will be coming back for more of that addictive, exhilarating and extremely immersive experience. I can only imagine how crazy it must be with Oculus Rift on your head. I'd be happy to try it, even if it meant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants (I'm dead serious here).   Also, generating new world every 24 hours is a brilliant move in a game like this. It gives you chance to get used to a new world and try your best in a leaderboard, while still keeping the game fresh and encouraging you to come back. Steam Workshop support is just a cherry on top. There's definitely a lot of replayability here.   The aesthetic is quite minimalistic, but it works and I like it. Also I'm sure it helps to avoid performance issues. There's no point in having complex, textured enviroments when moving at insane speed anyway… But like I said, I like it as it is. It gives the world this desolated-postapocalyptic-dystopian-wasteland-kind-of-feel. Soundtrack, although not very long, also helps with that representation. The individual tracks are pretty different in their atmosphere, but work very nicely together. Conclusion   If you're looking for a way to forget about the world around you for a while, test your reflexes and get your adrenaline and endorphine levels fixed in the process, this is the game you need. It's addictive, extremely rewarding and fun, with a great replay value. I labsolutely love it.   However, consider that this game is very minimalistic in it's design. I don't want to say it's lacking content, but I know some people may have trouble justifying the price tag because of it…so consider that, and maybe wait for a sale if that's what bothers you. Needless to say, I don't recommend it to people who don't like very fast-paced racing games / endless runners, or those who are not very good at making split-second decision.			"

												I've clocked up countless hours on this before it came to Steam and although it only does one thing, it does it VERY well. Ever had one of those conversations with your mother and weren't really paying attention, you can be playing this game with just one hand those hours of listening to how next door's neighbour's cat has ripped up another plant. Ever had to burp a baby for what seems forever, well, one hand for the burp, the other for this. Simple, well-honed controls that are tight and responsive, fully rebindable, clear aesthetic design and that sense of speed at 90fps (+) just has to be seen to be believed... It's beautiful, simple and elegant. It doesn't pretend to do anything more than one thing - to get as far as you can before the sun sets. And, with a number of well-planned unlocks and boosts available as you sink more time in, it keeps on giving you another reason to play more. Can't recommend it enough for what it does. And I'm just hoping it gets the praise it deserves!			"

												Race the Sun is, as it says on steam, a fast-paced racing game, and while it is singleplayer, there is a daily leaderboard that does as leaderboards do. In Race the Sun, you race through courses that vary every day. While the courses are not identical to the previous day's course, they will contain similar parts for each round, the varying being where the parts are pieced together.I have found this game to be rather addictive at times, partially due to the achievements and leaderboard. It is easy to restart a round, and playing on a course set for a specific day multiple times allows you to learn how the course for the day runs and how to improve on your previous score.The graphics are simple but beautiful, and while I do like the ingame music sometimes, I typically do runs with the ingame music turned off and my own music playing in the background. The game controls well and often relies on how precise you can be with your car movement. While the game is challenging, I have found it to be rather relaxing, doing some runs for personal bests and a high(ish) spot on the leaderboard, and other runs to relax and just see how far I can get, regardless of my score.So if you are looking for a good challenge or just a fun racing game, get Race the Sun.

Product received for free
												I got this game when it was free for a day, but I will try to review it independent of this.This game is an endless runner, with the central core mechanic that you should, as the title suggests 'Race the Sun'. Your ship is powered by the sun, and when the sun sets, it's game over. You can pick up powerups to extend the time the sun is up for, to try and chase for a high score on the leaderboards. The game also has a challenge system where each run you are asked to complete certain objectives to gain stars. You also can make minor upgrades to your ship.When you die, it's game over, then you have to start from the beginning again the next game.The game is fairly good fun, and it certainly captures the frantic nature of racing at a high speed, seeing objects rush past makes the game quite tense and exciting. This fun is counteracted by the infuriation that collisions can provide. One wrong move can mean game over (or at least losing a life), and it's always a little annoying when you mess up a long way into a good run.The gameplay is pretty basic, just flying your ship along and dodging obstacles whilst picking up power ups. It reminds me a little of that old game 'cube runner' on iphone, in fact in many ways this game is a lot like a phone game, rather than a full pc game. Of course it almost goes without saying that there is no storyThe other thing is, the game only has so much time before it becomes boring. It's effectively the same every run (although the overall layout changes once per day, which is a nice feature), which means that unless you are good enough to get to the later stages, you'll be stuck going repeatedly through the early ones. This repetitiveness means that you can really only play the game for short bursts at a time before you've had enough, and (for me at least) feel ready to move onto a game with a bit more depth. This is a game that, in my opinion, just doesn't have the longevity to keep the player interested. Notice how even a lot of the positive reviews only have a few hours played.Overall the game is fun for a quick blast, but it is let down by it's repitive nature. I can't really recommend anyone to pay full retail price for it, but it was worth getting when it was free, and I think that if it sounds like you'd enjoy it, it would also be worth getting in a steam sale.I'm kind of torn on the rating, but I think I have to go negative because the game just isn't good enough to be good value for its full RRP, especially when you look at the quality of some of the other games you could pick up for a similar price. That said, it sounds like a lot of other people really liked it, so don't let me put you off.			"

												Tot's Rundown: Don't buy this game expecting to play it for hours in one sitting, or a lot of depth. Buy it for an easy-going experience that will keep you coming back day after day.Race The Sun is a simple game at heart, and as such I just don't think it's realistic to expect to get hours of gameplay out of it in one sitting. I don't think that's what the game sets out to do, either. What it does do wonderfully is provide a great pick-up-and-play title that can easily become a daily routine.Watch the trailer or some other videos of it, and you'll get the basic premise. Yep, you just dodge stuff. There is no throttle and there is no brake, you're simply flying as fast and as far as you can before the sun - your source of energy - sets on the horizon. There are various pickups which make the gameplay more varied as you progress, such as an essential item that makes the sun rise in the sky for that much needed extended time. It's almost reminiscent of an old arcade-style racer, where when you ran out of time you had to insert more quarters, only without the quarters.The key aspect of this game is the changing worlds. Every day they release a new world for you to race in, so the challenge won't be the same as the last time you played it. And each world, at that, can be pleasantly varied as you fly farther and farther, progressing through the world's ""stages."" Add in custom user-made worlds (the game comes with a world editor) and Steam Workshop integration incoming, and you've got a whole lot of replayability.			"

												Read the full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/race-the-sun/I often found myself raging internally whilst playing Race the Sun. I'd get so far, just to crash right into a block that wasn't there a second ago. This only fueled my desire to try again, and again, and again, making this game fairly addictive.Race the Sun's objective is to simply ""Race the Sun"", as the title states. You're placed in control of what appears to be some sort of futuristic spaceship and tasked with riding towards the sun, just visible above the horizon directly ahead of the ship. The problem is, there are many obstacles in-between the ship and the sun. The obstacles become more obtrusive as time goes on, starting with the transition from static to dynamic objects. Upon crashing into any object, you're done, unless you happen to have a multiplier active, in which case, your multiplier disappears, but you remain alive.During this time, you're introduced to the various ""challenges"" that can be completed, and, upon completion, the challenge is replaced with a completely new challenge, among a variety of different challenges. These challenges reminded me of the goals included in that mobile game, Jetpack Joyride. The game also featured user-created worlds. Steam Workshop support is planned (according to the in-game menu), so we'll have to wait to unleash the full potential of the world builder.The game has a major flaw, that being the lack of diversity offered out of the box. Race the Sun is probably going to end up relying on user creations to keep its value over time, but the pre-packaged worlds did not satisfy the amount that I had expected from the game. Still looking forward to more worlds offered by the community.The game's graphics were set in grayscale, with a few very bright whites also present. This was a great style overall and I thought it fit well with the type of gameplay provided. The game also includes some great atmospheric sounds and music to it, although it was difficult to pay attention to while concentrating so hard on avoiding objects flying at you going hyperspeed.Race the Sun progressively built up my frustration when I played it for long periods of time. The gameplay works best when experienced in small bursts. Warning: Playing for extended periods of time may result in a broken controller. Race the Sun's purchase can be justified if you're the type of gamer who can't sit through a game for more than 30 minutes.

												This game is simply fantastic. The idea that you are racing against the sun is something that I haven't seen done before. The challenges and bonuses you get make the game even better. Plus the worlds reset every 24 hours meaning you don't just play the same levels over and over.			"

												""Race the Sun"" is an incredibly insane fast-pacing racing game - and weirdly enough it's somehow addictive... Rules are simple: stay in the sun, fly fast and... don't crash! (Easier said than done, I know that...) Upgrade your ship and be even faster next round, come again tomorrow and the world has changed...Highly recommended for adrenaline junkies!Definitely check out the Youtube-Supercut Video on the store page!

												I see some people are having a tough time choosing if to buy this game or not so i will go over the pros and the cons.Pros-fastpaced-both casual players and hardcore players can play-world resets-the addition of the workshopCons-can get repetitive-leveling is difficult when higher than about 10-a lot of repetition-tedious for some of the challengesSo with these pros and cons that I thought of, You can decide for yourself or if you want my opionion on this game it is, this game will make you want to punch you computer screen once you play for long periods of time, you will not only see a ton of repetition if you go down the same path (remember you can go either way), and last i would only tell you to buy this if you dont get mad easily. So I say yes to most but to some I would have to say no, but you can never tell what side you are on till you try the game-First- Find out what time the world resets for you (i.e. My world resets at 10pm) once you have found out the time minus 2 hours and add 2 hours from that number. (i.e. My case it would be 8pm and 12am)-Second- Play the game only during these time zones. (One note since the world resets during this time don't try for challenges it might get difficult)This is how i can play this game for a long period of time without wanting to punch my computer screen. I do recommend this tip for anyone who doesn't like to play the game for more than 2 hours because of repetition.			"

												Race the Sun is fantastic. In ""racing"" games I like a sheer sense of speed. This game gives you that. It will test your reflexes and make you want to throw your controller sometimes. Unfortunately, as with any game, there are some downsides. The menus aren't controller optimized. You /can/ navigate through the menus with a controller, but its pretty frustrating. The actual game plays marvelously with a controller however. That, or a mechanical keyboard. This is an endless type of game. It will keep spawning new environments for you to fly through. On top of that, the developers refresh the game every 24 hours. Yes, you heard me correctly. The level changes every 24 hours. Not to mention all the wonderful steam workshop levels available. Pick this up if you haven't already. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												Race the Sun reminds me in many ways of the Java-based title flood runner -- another endless runner that would see you piloting a hovercraft of sorts through procedurally generated terrain, populated by increasingly dense simple shapes. flood runner was a game that proved so instantly accessible and absurdly addictive that our school at the time had to ban every site that carried it, just to make sure we did some work.Race the Sun also falls into that mould. Ostensibly an endless runner with two simple rules -- always move forward, and never crash -- players are free to roam about the minimalist landscapes in lateral fashion via a solar-powered vehicle. Indeed, you'll need to in order to avoid the rush of oncoming shapes and structures. The turning circle of your ship is sluggish to begin with, and decisive flying is of paramount importance.The game begins with languid sojourns through open, spacious environments, the sun atop the horizon constantly threatening to set and bring your journey to an end. There are pickups strewn liberally across the maps: blue ones (Tris) add to your score multiplier, green ones earn you the ability to make a single jump, the white ones enshrined in soft pillars of light prolong the day and speed up your craft, and then there's the rare pink object which gives you one free pass when it comes to the crunch.Diverting from the easy, straight course to risk ruin amidst the denser pockets of each level in order to chase down pickups seems needless at the very start But the first time the sun sets and leaves your craft without power, stranded ignobly and with a lamentable score, you begin to realise the importance of chasing them down.There's some progression in there too, with Jetpack Joyride-esque objectives in 1-star, 2-star, and 3-star difficulty flavourings, the completion of which will help to boost your pilot ranking. Some of these missions see you accumulating Tris or travelling a certain distance, others might have you performing a certain number of barrel rolls (thereby forcing you to move laterally a lot more than you would) within the space of a single run, or only turning left. There's a pleasant sense of accomplishment that follow the completion of some of these thingsOne of the best things about the whole experience is the relay system. If you're finding the game too tricky, you can make use of the little option at the end of each run that allows you to share a relay point via email or across social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Basically, another player can then start from where you finished, and then when they crash or run out of solar power, the chain can be continued. Buddy up with a friend, and you can leapfrog one another to maximise points and distance, helping to unlock more of the fiendish 3-star accomplishments. You can only create a four-stage relay, but it works very nicely indeed.So race the sun great game if you have a pc you need this even on the lowest graphical settings this game is a thrill to playAnother well deserved 10/10			"

You are a solar craft. The sun is your death timer. Hurtle towards the sunset at breakneck speed in a futile race against time. Delay the inevitable by catching energy boosts which reverse the setting sun - if only for a moment. Race The Sun is inspired by arcade games of the past with a focus on highscores, short game sessions, and a sense of pure fun mingled with a nerve-wracking tension. The rules are simple: don't crash, stay in the light, and don't slow down! -  Recommended!			"

												            So take the classic space themed shooter ""SPACE HARRIER"" and remove the shooting aspect, advance the graphics, add a few abilities (jumping, boost), insert a simple scoring system, make it hard as hell to not crash into EVERYTHING and you have begun to picture what ""Race The Sun"" is. I happen to find this game to be really fun though. I play it in short little bursts when I do not have time to sit and play something that requires time. If that sounds like fun to you this game is a winner. If not then it probably will not be your cup of tea. -Casey "

												A fairly simple game with simplistic, minimal graphics and a solid concept, Race The Sun will satisfy your need for arcade style dodging games.It doesn't do much more, but then it also doesn't ask for more, or need to do more. You can go for achievements, level up to get new bonusses for your ship, and just try to beat your(Or your friends' records.The only con I can at this point think of is that it is somewhat repetitive(The levels are remade daily though, so you can always come back tomorrow), and that it is rather slow in letting you unlock things.All in all, a solid game and worth a playthrough or two, but don't count on spending several days locked into this game. It's not that kind of game			"

												True, it has a simple design, but it exels at it. This game will test your twitch reflexes as you soar over, around, and between obstacles in an attempt to survive as long as you can in a literal race against the sun. The longer you can last, the farther you will go. You receive multiple power-ups and ship upgrades that extend time and effect speed and control. The controls are smooth and the game provides a constant challenge. The music is adequate. RACE THE SUN is an addictive and satisfying experience that is well worth the ride.			"

 Recommendation  Recommended to purchase on sale  Base Game Score  C+  Style  Racing/Action  Recommendation Summary  Race The Sun is a racing/action game in which you dodge obstacles while you race the setting sun, and try to get as far as you can. It is a fun little game, but feels more like a web-based game rather and a downloadable game. However, it is a quality little indie game and is recommended, and the graphics are good and the racing is also fine. However, I would personally just buy it on sale, as the replayability is low.

A fairly intuitive World Creator is included for making your own custom maps, which can then be shared with the community. Suitable for all ages and extremely easy to pick up and play for people just starting out. Very enjoyable, with plenty to offer for both casual and competitive gamers.			"

												Mixed feelings. I bought this game to enjoy some high-speed flying in an open world, but in farther regions of it I actually don't get that much enjoyment because of dense, hazardous, and unforgiving landscape that keeps me crashing into something. The landscape has patterns, of course, and those patterns can be more or less efficiently learned after several runs (thus allowing you to improve your performance), but even a slightest mistake imminently turns out to be fatal. The aircraft's ability to steer left and right does not really match its acceleration; sometimes I feel like I could use a bit more agility.The gameplay itself is relatively simple; if you watched videos on the game's page in Steam store, then you've actually seen most of what it has to offer.If you are happy to exercise your quick reaction and fast reflexes, then you will probably find this game involving and worthy of your money. If, otherwise, you are not the best in making correct decisions in milliseconds, then you might prefer to look for the fun somewhere else.			"

												You are a ship racing against a setting sun. Without solar power, your ship stalls and the game ends. This is a very fun game as other reviews attest to.I am more interested in the Lore of this game. Does RtS take place on Earth? Is this game a depiction of a future apocalypse? Is this the last sunset?  What are these strange geometries that you navigate? Are they the ruins of once great cities? Is your ship an ark carrying the last vestiges of humanity? Why is the ship compelled to race the sun, knowing that the sun can never be beaten. Existential. Sysiphean. Nihilistic. Protean. Mythopoetic. Lagubrious. These are all words I would (and am) use (-ing) to describe this game.Why do we race the sun? Because we want to stay in the light. "

It is a fun little game, but feels more like a web-based game rather and a downloadable game. However, it is a quality little indie game and is recommended, and the graphics are good and the racing is also fine. However, I would personally just buy it on sale, as the replayability is low.

												Post-Rock: The Video Game.It's essentially a rogue-like racing game. If that idea appeals to you, I can't reccomend this game enough.My only complaint would be the default music for the game. It gets repetitive pretty fast. If you were to mute it, however, and put on something like, say. God Is An Astronaut: 


YouTube™ Video: God is an astronaut - No return 

			Views: 660,264		

			band : God is an astronaut song : No return alb : God is an astronaut		

 while you play, you'll really have something special.It's fun, it's addictive, it's challenging, it's beautiful. There's nothing else like it. The fact that the worlds are randomly generated makes it something even greater that I will probably keep playing for a very long time.			"

												Race The Sun is a good game, and you can probably tell whether you'll like it by the screenshots and videos on the Steam page, but, in case you're not sure, allow me to elaborate.I think the goal of the game is fairly obvious, you need to race the sun with a solar-powered spacecraft. The theme is not just a gimmick though: since some obstacles in the game project shadows, you will sometimes not be able to see the sun, and that will slow you down, meaning that the sun will set faster in the horizon. Basically, every mistake you make has an immediate and tangible effect on the game. The controls are tight and responsive, and the hitboxes seem logical and fair most of the time (if you die, it's most likely your fault and not the game's). Plus, the view distance is not infinite, but good enough for you to be able to spot obstacles and react to them in time.The ""real"" goal of the game is to get as high of a score as possible by collecting ""tris"", which are basically score multipliers. For every five tris you get, your multiplier will go up by one, but if you bump sideways into something you lose one. You lose the game when you crash into an obstacle or if your craft's battery is depleted due to lack of exposure to direct sunlight.There are some collectible items you can find as well, which can increase your speed temporarily, allow you to jump, skip the level or save you if you crash into something. A final thing to keep in mind is that there are some mini challenges that you need to complete in order to level up, which will, in turn, unlock collectibles, give you ship upgrades, a better starting multiplier, decals for your ship or make your existing upgrades better. I got to the maximum level in about 8 hours, but that's not where the game exhausts its content.If you wish to keep playing, there are plenty of things to keep you occupied: first off, the main game's world is reset every 24 hours, which means you have some time to learn the various obstacles during the day, but you will get a new challenge after you're done with it. Secondly, there are two other modes, one that is a considerably more difficult version of the standard world and another one that is actually a beatable maze, which I found to be a really cool alternative take on the core gameplay.And, last but not least, you can find some special portals on the levels, and those portals will lead you to an ""alternate universe"", which is basically a user-created level. And yes, there is an editor, of course.That's quite a bit of stuff for an indie game, right? Now, when it comes to the audiovisual aspects of the game, the graphics are really simple and streamlined (and, let's face it, somewhat outdated) but they have their charm, especially if you enjoy a ""zen"" sci-fi aesthetic. While the basic colors are gray, orange and white, the alternate worlds are much more varied and explosive in their visuals and can range from dying planets blowing up in front of you to star wars-esque space battles.The game's music begins as a calm but focused tune which slowly ramps up in intensity as the sun goes down, finishing in a downright violent manner in the later levels. It might get a little tiring after a while, but I find it to be pleasant to listen to either way.I think that's it, if you like racing, obstacle courses or simply want a new indie game to kill a few minutes every day with, this is definitely a good and cost-efficient choice.

												I am beginning to enjoy games that make it  easy to have a quick 3-5 minutes of gametime but still reward you with a solid gaming experience. The games that do this best are games that have randomly generated daily challenges, (i.e Spelunky , The binding of Issac etc) and Race the Sun accomplishes this perfectly. If played for longer than 20 minutes at a time it can be infuriating , but making the daily challenge a part of my gaming routine is enough to keep my reflexes sharp and honed as this game is all about reaction time and quick decision making. Simple yet smart art style takes me back to my days of playing Star Wars in the arcade with the vector styled graphics.  Definitely a must for those that enjoyed games like F-zero or Wipe-out.			"

												Beautiful and simple are two words that perfectly sum up this game. The object of the game is extremely simple, fly through each level collecting points and get a high score. But like all simple games, this game is certainly not as easy as that! The terrains are very challenging and your solitary life means you get no second chances.Visually this game takes a minimalist approach and makes it work... Indeed it works so well that this is the best example of minimalist, monochrome graphics i have ever seen. This is as much a work of art as it is a game. The graphics compliment the simplistic gameplay perfectly and the result is a straightforward, somewhat no-frills game that is a joy to play. I highly recommend this title!			"

It's very rare to see a simple idea for game, it's very fun. The soundtracks are great, and fit very well with the gameplay.9/10 Would definately buy a dlc for Xwing with March of Resistance soundtrack if it exist.Look forward to Flippyfly next project!			"

												Every time I pick this game up, it makes me smile. It's relaxing, but it's also REALLY hard. And it's new every time. Each day, a new world is built to race through.It's simple, but challenging, and pretty. And it's just all around fun!I can't justify the price without qualification - it is very simplistic for a $10 game, but I recommend at the very least keeping an eye on it for a sale. And definitely check YouTube for some videos. If it looks interesting to you, pick it up. If you're not quite sold on it, wait for a sale. The Sunrise DLC is a lot less pressure, and is just... really happy and more of a casual-friendly experience. It does the ""relaxing"" part better, by throwing less of the ""challenge"" side at you.			"

												A fun game where you try and dodge obstacles. Basic graphics, and mostly black and white display make it very unique. Each time you play it is the same map, but you get new upgrades for your ship that make you more successful and give you more options to make it further. Every 24 hours new levels are generated. Seems very strongly supportive of game controllers / consoles.

												If you played Barrier X, then this may bring to mind some pretty bad memories.  It's a game about focus, precision, and quick thinking.  One crash and it's OVER!  Oh, but that's not all...be prepared for some conditions that make life all the more difficult.Race the Sun is a game about playing as a solar-powered craft racing on to the infinity, but the problem is that you're only racing when the sun is in the sky...and it's sunset!!!  Shadows also slow you down...and if your battery runs out without you crashing, it's Game Over!Shadows, a descending sun, and moving obstacles that you can crash into.  Long story short, this is a rage game in the disguise of a game of simple design.  For the masochistic, there is an apocalypse mode where you're racing even faster than before (and a sun that descends even faster) that and a labyrinth mode with even more obstacles.  Just thinking about it gives me a headache!!!Now, you can aim for a high score, but that insists on you collecting blue objects without tapping into an obstacle.  As you level up, you will find powerups that can help you.  A magnet to collect points easier, an object that holds more jumps, an object that holds more revives (not that it'll matter)...don't expect them to save you for long, though.If you insist on getting this game, get it on sale.  Paying $10 just to be frustrated won't be worth losing your hair over.  (You can tear that out for free)3.5/10  Starts out simple, but ends in a crash!  (At least the program doesn't crash)			"

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Race the Sun. A Bit Slow Paced for A Fast Endless Runner.Genre: Minimalist Endless RacerDeveloped & Published by: Flippfly LLCPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and iOS. Business Model: Cheaper Base Game + Single Optional DLCCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsAs it says on the store page, Race the Sun has you driving a solar craft across a vast, endless space filled with obstacles galore. Your only timer is a constantly setting sun that you must race towards. If the sun sets or you get caught in a long shadow for too long, the craft will run out of power and the race is over. Each world is separated by regions that get progressively harder as more objects and obstacles are thrown into your path. Within certain districts are portals to optional levels to change the pace up. Workshop support allows you to try out community created worlds though I found these got a little too difficult for my taste. There’s also a leveling system where you need to complete goals (given to you in a set of three) every time you race. Some are pretty generic with completing a certain amount of score or reaching a certain district while others can be overly difficult (do a barrel roll 20 times in a single try, yeah, still can’t accomplish that task). Additionally, your solar craft can be configured with different attachments and badges. These are unlocked as you level up and seem to be quality of life changes to your craft, not real game changers.It’s a simplistic game where all you do is steer around objects and hit as many power ups (speed boosters and jump boosters are the most common) as you can. The high speed action takes some skill and split second decision making in order to be successful. Even then, you can easily get plastered against a wall for not reacting fast enough and that can get old fast. If there was a main complaint I’d have, it's that unlocks take way too long to get. Even after a couple of hours, I still haven’t gotten a single badge and there’s still more than half of the attachments left to unlock. There’s a constant sense of frustration at not getting much reward for making even the slightest amount of progress. I often got tired of doing the first region over and over again because I crashed on a simple rock at the beginning of the second region. I feel like there could be a better way of handling it but I have yet to see an endless runner do anything about it. Race the Sun does have procedurally generated levels but the structure is largely the same and all that really changes is what objects are in each district. RtS used to have daily challenges but they seem to have been patched out.  PC Settings and Sunrise DLCA fairly decent set of options can be found in Race the Sun. There’s a large amount of resolutions to choose from with fullscreen on/off. A quality slider that vaguely goes from fantastic to fastest. Vsync can be enabled/disabled. There’s two audio sliders for effects and music. Both a keyboard and a controller can be used and both work equally well. The keys can be rebound with optional secondaries. The Linux version seems to work quite well too. Anti-aliasing seems tied into the quality slider. I never had any performance problems or crashing. Video and audio work well together in this game too. The Sunrise DLC is for an optional world where there's no leaderboards, setting sun or optional objectives. It's ok but I kind of feel like its superfluous with multiple Workshop levels having the same rules. It at least looks quite pretty but I don't think $2 is worth pretty. Final ThoughtsRace the Sun has a good visual/audio design and it's one of the few endless runners I’ve run into that doesn’t try to waste your time with some nonsense business model. It's also a decently skillful runner too and has a good sense of speed, not dependent upon gimmicky controls or QTEs to slow you down. However, I find that the pacing is a little too long between unlocks. They can take far too long and too many runs to obtain and what you end up getting doesn't really change the game for the next hundred races. So, it can be a little too boring. If you’re ok with a repetitive endless run that isn’t looking to suck the money out of your wallet, Race the Sun is something to consider. Just don’t expect too much excitement and a lot of re-racing the first region. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												This game is so fun. You race against the sun setting and each region increases in difficulty. Time extenders become more and more rare making the way you navigate harder because you will try to shoot across the map to grab it ultimately ending in you slamming into an obstacle. Leaderboards are nice to compete with your friends on and workshop support coming will only improve this game. Can't wait to see what the community creates.			"

												Simple yet elegant and fun game, your goal is to race towards the sun while avoiding obstacles.When you start playing the game you will realize you can only move left and right but you probably won't even finish the first stage on your few first tries since it's more complex than that, there's various obstacles that if you crash head-on will be instant death, and they get harder the further you go/the more the sun has set.Well, you probably would be done if that is all this game had to it, but hey, how about upgrades?You can level up by completing challenges set by the game which ranges from simple ""score few points"" to ""complete a set number of  stages just turning left/right in a single run"" which then will provide you with level-ups that will soon enable you to do such thing as jumps, adding a new dimension to game, unlocking new power-ups, a whole new difficulty (Apocalypse) for you tryhards, decals to customize your ships and few other things.Music is pretty nice too, the further you go the more the music get intense, and the feeling of acomplishment of getting further each run is really satisfying, then you ask: ""So it's just another unlock upgrades or you aren't getting very far game?""to which I answer : ""No.""You probably can get very far without any upgrades if you know what obstacles are ahead and with a bit of planning.Another upside is that the stages changes everyday and you can create/play custom stages made by other players so there's replay value to be had.I would give it a 8/10, get it if you think the price tag is fine, or wait a sale to get it, but definetely support the devs for making such a cool game with a neat concept.

Product received for free
												I recieved this for free and while I find it enjoyable it is not a game that I would buy simply beacause of it's replayability and originality. The game reminds me alot of a flash game I played alot a few years ago called Cubefield http://www.cubefield.org.uk/, and while this game is superior it isn't that different. Cubefield only gives you two decisions, right and left and while Race the Sun has the occasional jump along with a more detailed map, you still end up doing about the same thing.So, I could put this as a ""Buy it on Sale"" thing, but if this is on a Summer sale, then so should these ten dollar or less games you could buy like any of Vlambeer's titles, Hotline Miami or Ratz Instagib 2.0 just to name a few.

Race The SunRating: 8 / 10Beat the sun by racing your ship through the obstacles and picking up stuff to make you jump, go faster and enhance your score with only one goal: to keep flying. Minimalistic racer that keeps you starting over and over again after you hit another object. You always start at the beginning of the level (resets after 24 hours) so after a while you know where to go and to pick up your powerups. The races are fairly short but that makes you try it over and over again. Levelling up is also pretty ok as you get 3 goals to achieve and you have to get 4 goals to get to the next level. You then get additional stuff like the ability to jump or double jump, better multipliers and enhancements to your ship like magnets to pick up powerups. Pretty decently done and I definitely recommend the game to all!So get it and race!			"

												Surprisingly a very good game. It feels like AudioSurf with a goal; that goal being race against the sun. You can't pick your own tracks, but the in game music is some pretty nice stuff. The maps are separated into areas called, ""Regions,"" and each Region is large enough to explore new areas. This means tons of replayability as it always feels fresh. It's a simplistic but it's great fun. For an early access game it feels practically done. Highly worth the price IMO.			"

In this kind of game, controls need to be tight, and they are here, and it's the perfect game to pick up for cheap, with the various sales is goes on.

												Why do you race the sun? What's the purpose? What are you trying to achieve? These questions will never once go through your head as you're travelling at light speed, avoiding obstacles, exploring surreal realms, and straying from the shadows that seek to slow your journey. This is not a game that you'll lose hours in, searching for rhyme or reason. This is a game you'll lose hours in, just trying to improve on your speed. A ""pick up and go"" game, as I like to call them. A game you'll no doubt come to every now and then, if only for a three minute session.Remember the original Starfox on the Super Nintendo? This is pretty much the same concept, except without lasers. It's a harback to those days of old, when gaming was just as addicting as it was immersive. You travel through an ever changing world at immense speeds, collecting items known as as ""tris"". But that's only to improve your multiplier. Perhaps the most fun of it is picking up powerups to make you go even faster, but you must avoid obstacles, take risky manuevers through thin narrow paths, and make split second decisions to avoid that one falling block that could destroy all your progress.With maps you can download from the workshop, the main Race The Sun map changes consistently, every 24 hours, to make each playthrough more or less difficult. And once you unlock portals to other dimensions, it makes the experience that more dynamic. It's not a thinking game as much as it is a reflex game.Also, I dare you to Race The Sun while drunk. Made for a competitive New Years.			"

												This game is amazing. It only does one thing but it does it incredibly well. The graphics are simple but at the speed you're racing you don't really have the time to admire the scenery of all of the procedurally generated levels. You can level up in the game by completing certain tasks and as you level up the game adds mechanics to racing as well as abilities for your ship. The music is fantastic, which is good because it seems to only have 3 or 4 tracks that I've noticed. So the music gets a bit repetative.Overall I'd say get the game. It's simple, super fun, a great time waste, and cheap!			"

												OMG!!! This game is fricking fantastic. The sense of speed is great, controls are spot on and the learning curve is perfefct. Minimalistic but excellent graphics and sound and music  that goes perfectly with the game. When you jump it maes youfeel like you are flying. There's an iOS game called Warp Rush that similar, but Race The Sun blows that game away!!! The more you play the better you get and the more fun it gets.And then to top it all, you can make your own worlds!!!! Jeezuz!!! I hope they make an iOS version so I can play on my  iPad also.			"

												Definitely one of those games that gives more than you pay for. At least that's how it made me feel.PROs so far (1h gameplay):- Pretty minimalistic graphics- Highly replayable- Randomish maps - basically never exactly the same- Progressively changes difficulty - Unlocks may make you gameplay easier or harder depending on how they behave- Not eye damaging :D- Addictive as hellCONs:- Prone to bugs, however extremely rare and in odd conditions (unlikely to be repeated)- Controller is not fully supported. You can play the game properly, however recognising B as a back button for example would be a nice addition.All in all, this game pulls you in and keeps you there permanently if you let it. Well worth a buy, even considering the current sales around steam.			"

												I'm absolutely loving this game. It starts as your standard high speed ""dodge absolutely everything"" style game (which to be perfectly honest is good enough for me to begin with. I love games like that), but quickly upgrades, achievements, accelerated movement, compounding level complexity, and ever approaching impending doom (the setting sun) escalate and elevate things beyond the competition. The game runs, as expected, incredibly smoothly on my i7 980x and GTX 680 at maximum settings and resolution. I suspect more modest systems would run it quite happily as well. The graphics are a bit retro, but very clean and adequately appealing. Most importantly, it effectively conveys a sense of speed.If you've never played any games in this genre (or happen to be a fan of them), Race The Sun is most akin to the Android game ""SpeedX 3D"", or the flash games ""3D Missile Game"" and its newer sibling ""Accelerator"".Links to the mentioned games:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamelion.speedx3dhttp://missile-game.bwhmather.com/http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/627313Bottom line: If you like ""infinite run"" games, RTS is a winner even at full price, and a steal with the current Steam discount.

												A game of its own, it's a really interesting racer(?). It does well with its sun system, that will keep your vehicle moving if you go fast enough and keep the sun upgrades nearby at all times. It has some decent challenges, but the FOV at times can really make dodging things in an instant a bit heckling. It's a decent game, however I can't say if it's worth the price, since I got it for free on Day 1 launch. That's up to you to decide.Things to consider: -Do I want a game with replay value?-Do I want a game to boot up and play instantly when bored?-Do I not mind the price?-Does the workshop hold interest in me?If you answered ""Yes"" to at least two of these, go ahead. Overall?: 8/10. Great music, optimization, and easy-to-learn controls. It can easily hold interest whilst bored, but don't expect to be playing this for hours at a time.			"

												Why do you race the sun? What's the purpose? What are you trying to achieve? These questions will never once go through your head as you're travelling at light speed, avoiding obstacles, exploring surreal realms, and straying from the shadows that seek to slow your journey. This is not a game that you'll lose hours in, searching for rhyme or reason. This is a game you'll lose hours in, just trying to improve on your speed. A ""pick up and go"" game, as I like to call them. A game you'll no doubt come to every now and then, if only for a three minute session.Remember the original Starfox on the Super Nintendo? This is pretty much the same concept, except without lasers. It's a harback to those days of old, when gaming was just as addicting as it was immersive. You travel through an ever changing world at immense speeds, collecting items known as as ""tris"". But that's only to improve your multiplier. Perhaps the most fun of it is picking up powerups to make you go even faster, but you must avoid obstacles, take risky manuevers through thin narrow paths, and make split second decisions to avoid that one falling block that could destroy all your progress.With maps you can download from the workshop, the main Race The Sun map changes consistently, every 24 hours, to make each playthrough more or less difficult. And once you unlock portals to other dimensions, it makes the experience that more dynamic. It's not a thinking game as much as it is a reflex game.Also, I dare you to Race The Sun while drunk. Made for a competitive New Years.			"

												This game is amazing. It only does one thing but it does it incredibly well. The graphics are simple but at the speed you're racing you don't really have the time to admire the scenery of all of the procedurally generated levels. You can level up in the game by completing certain tasks and as you level up the game adds mechanics to racing as well as abilities for your ship. The music is fantastic, which is good because it seems to only have 3 or 4 tracks that I've noticed. So the music gets a bit repetative.Overall I'd say get the game. It's simple, super fun, a great time waste, and cheap!			"

												I almost dont recomend this game. Ill tell you why.Pros:The gameplay is very satisfying and the map is updated every day to provide a somewhat unique expirence.Controller support (Not a great game with keyboard).....errr yeah...Cons.For some mind boggling reason they locked a lot of the mechanics behind some arbitrary achivement like challenges. The power ups and collectables and upgrades for your ship are all locked behind this. I almost quit the game after 10 minutes until I realized this as the game was very boring.The whole Idea behind this is you have until the sun sets to get as far as you can. The only way to gain more time is by randomly placed yellow boost power ups. I dont like this. It means your runs are more luck based than skill. I would have prefered the blue 'score' pickups to have gained you more time instead.That being said. There is only one game mode and one map. There is no story and no tutorial. It feels the game is lacking a large amount of content. There is a mod support but I cant be bothered to sort through all the mods to find some more maps to play. If the devs dont want to put in the effort then why should I?The do update the map everyday to change it but the same assets are used... just moved around. So even though it is techniqually different, it feels the same.Final thoughtThe gameplay that is there is very satisfying and fun. It's just a shame that that is all there is to it. I would love to see some actual content added here. If you see it on a sale go ahead and pick it up.			"

												Fun game to play for a quick fix if you're bored. Enjoyable challenging missions to complete and upgrade your racer with many customisations to keep the game feeling fresh but familiar. Hand made levels each day to also keep the game new.Overall a very fun game.			"

												A game of its own, it's a really interesting racer(?). It does well with its sun system, that will keep your vehicle moving if you go fast enough and keep the sun upgrades nearby at all times. It has some decent challenges, but the FOV at times can really make dodging things in an instant a bit heckling. It's a decent game, however I can't say if it's worth the price, since I got it for free on Day 1 launch. That's up to you to decide.Things to consider: -Do I want a game with replay value?-Do I want a game to boot up and play instantly when bored?-Do I not mind the price?-Does the workshop hold interest in me?If you answered ""Yes"" to at least two of these, go ahead. Overall?: 8/10. Great music, optimization, and easy-to-learn controls. It can easily hold interest whilst bored, but don't expect to be playing this for hours at a time.			"

												Why do you race the sun? What's the purpose? What are you trying to achieve? These questions will never once go through your head as you're travelling at light speed, avoiding obstacles, exploring surreal realms, and straying from the shadows that seek to slow your journey. This is not a game that you'll lose hours in, searching for rhyme or reason. This is a game you'll lose hours in, just trying to improve on your speed. A ""pick up and go"" game, as I like to call them. A game you'll no doubt come to every now and then, if only for a three minute session.Remember the original Starfox on the Super Nintendo? This is pretty much the same concept, except without lasers. It's a harback to those days of old, when gaming was just as addicting as it was immersive. You travel through an ever changing world at immense speeds, collecting items known as as ""tris"". But that's only to improve your multiplier. Perhaps the most fun of it is picking up powerups to make you go even faster, but you must avoid obstacles, take risky manuevers through thin narrow paths, and make split second decisions to avoid that one falling block that could destroy all your progress.With maps you can download from the workshop, the main Race The Sun map changes consistently, every 24 hours, to make each playthrough more or less difficult. And once you unlock portals to other dimensions, it makes the experience that more dynamic. It's not a thinking game as much as it is a reflex game.Also, I dare you to Race The Sun while drunk. Made for a competitive New Years.			"

												I almost dont recomend this game. Ill tell you why.Pros:The gameplay is very satisfying and the map is updated every day to provide a somewhat unique expirence.Controller support (Not a great game with keyboard).....errr yeah...Cons.For some mind boggling reason they locked a lot of the mechanics behind some arbitrary achivement like challenges. The power ups and collectables and upgrades for your ship are all locked behind this. I almost quit the game after 10 minutes until I realized this as the game was very boring.The whole Idea behind this is you have until the sun sets to get as far as you can. The only way to gain more time is by randomly placed yellow boost power ups. I dont like this. It means your runs are more luck based than skill. I would have prefered the blue 'score' pickups to have gained you more time instead.That being said. There is only one game mode and one map. There is no story and no tutorial. It feels the game is lacking a large amount of content. There is a mod support but I cant be bothered to sort through all the mods to find some more maps to play. If the devs dont want to put in the effort then why should I?The do update the map everyday to change it but the same assets are used... just moved around. So even though it is techniqually different, it feels the same.Final thoughtThe gameplay that is there is very satisfying and fun. It's just a shame that that is all there is to it. I would love to see some actual content added here. If you see it on a sale go ahead and pick it up.			"

It feels great racing at incredibly fast speeds to stay alive for as long as possible, and overall I highly recommend this game.Protip: Mute the game's soundtrack and play powermetal in the background.

												Reminds me of the old 3D vector racing games, you simply have to continue on chasing that sun in the distance without hitting obstacles. It also has some interesting mechanics such as your ship's power comes from solar energy, meaning if you spend too long in the dark you won't even need to worry about crashing, you will come to a complete halt. There are also pickups that extend the time it takes for the sun to set helping you keep your sun energy high and I enjoyed this teeter-totter style play where I frequently shift my eyes all around the screen hunting for pickups while trying to concentrate on my ship and the obstacles ahead. The maps are also generated daily and this keeps the replayability levels quite high whether you play for a few runs a day or hours at a time.In short: I'd rate it around a 7. The graphics are simplistic but quite plain at the beginning which doesn't really appeal to me.			"

												If you're looking for a fun, future-racer, look elsewhere.I don't really understand the appeal of this game, and figured that with all the glowing reviews, I should try it out for myself.There's not enough variety or interest for me. It ends up being an experience similar to a rogue-lite, but without the bonus of interesting enemies and items.Granted, I haven't put much time into the game, but then again, I didn't feel compelled to.The point is, it's exactly what it looks like, so if that doesn't appeal to you, don't do what I did and just assume there must be some other layer of appeal if all these people are recommending it.

												Race The Sun is a fun game, but the story is kind of lame.~Plot Spoilers Below~You are James McCloud, an ace pilot of futuristic aircraft that is stranded on a planet of monstrous gigantic insectoids and humanoid settlers that are in the middle of being bombed by attacking forces. James is stranded because his son (from an inter-species relationship I guess??) got into a fight with his racing rival, and with a cry of ""FALCOOOOON PUUUUUUNCH!"" his starship was destroyed.Fortunately, James finds a replacement very quickly thanks to the help of an eco-friendly scientist that has created a very fast spaceship, which McCloud needs in order to survive the harsh nights of this world because he hasn't had the chance to adapt to this new atmophere. The ship is fast, but its weakness is that it relies on solar energy. Further complicating matters, James McCloud has yet to completely adapt to the planet's atmosphere, thus he must Race The Sun if he has any chance of surviving for long enough to be transported to the next stage of the F-Zero Grand Prix.The ship can be customized with several decals and augmentations. The augmentations allow James to Drive Faster, Jump, Obtain power-ups from further away, Warp several meters directly upward to avoid a collision, and store more instances of the jumping / collision-deterring power-ups. The decals are cosmetic, but you can pretend they make you go faster. There are also portals into worlds unknown on this planet: some lead to space, others lead to Underland, computer motherboards, or other trippy places for a mushroom samba experience like no other.Just watch out for crumbling buildings, mutant caterpillars and combat frogs, and drone airstrikes from the black queen's empire. <Vee's Rating> This is the best crossover of Star Fox, F-Zero, and Battletoads that I have ever played <3			"

												Race The Sun feels like an unfinished game with potential. It's mildly entertaining to do while listening or watching something else but isn't nearly as fun as it could and should be.With a little more development I feel this could be a game I'd recommend but for now it feels like a free to play or something close to it.

												5/10. Don't see what all the fuss is about. This is exactly what it looks like, that flash game from 15 years ago with updated graphics. You do the same thing, pilot a ship through uninteresting white terrain with obstacles, and you gain increased points and then you die and you have to restart the entire thing over again. It is not randomized and you will just redo the same terrain and area you just did, making it feel super repetitive. The controls of the ship aren't good enough or tight enough that they demand. Trying both the keyboard and a gamepad, the ship takes a bit to get moving, and then one you start it moving it takes a while to stop or switch course. It just feels too heavy and not as responsive as it should be, leading to many undeserved deaths. Yes you can keep grinding and finally get to much later levels, but 5-10 min without a single mistake is kind of dumb to ask, although some people like it I guess, judging from the reviews. There is only one mode unless you grind for a while, and the free mode they should have included as free update/DLC they instead charge for. You complete tasks while playing to gain little abilities, but things like the magnet don't even seem to work much, and others are just more pickups that let you jump once or speed you up for a second, hardly changing things. At once point I was doing well and all of a suddent a plane appeared right above me and dropped a bomb that covered the screen in white and I did. There was nothing I could do to stop from dying, and being killed by something I had never seen and force me to start from scratch just seems dumb. This game encourages grinding and doesn't have much to offer. Really not enough here to differentiate it from a free game, so just go to addictinggames.com and save yourself the money.			"

												Not a bad 'endless runner' style flying game. If you get it cheap the time spent can be fun, and downloading mod-levels is an ok way of briefly extending the life of the mechanic. Feels like a tribute to old arcade games, and just like some of them, it fails to leave an impression worth revisiting outside of nostalgic memory.			"

												Very fun, casual game to play when you don't really want to play something more action-y. Also a very good game to play windowed while doing something else. Along with an integrated steam workshop it's fun to see and complete tracks that others have created. I personally wouldn't pay ten dollars for it, though. Maybe pick it up on a sale or something. This is coming from someone who got it for free though. So, take that with a grain of salt.			"

												It's simple, charming, but oh so addictive and effective when it comes to killing time while enjoying the process of doing so. Upbeat and very rhythmic soundtrack, extremely fitting for such a fast-paced game. Sweet visuals, albeit the style is minimalistic - in my opinion, it adds vastly to the charm.Downloading a game? Pop this beaut up and blast those hours away - assuming you've got nothing more productive to do, heh?The sun is a wondrous body. Like a magnificent father!

												It's an okay game, controls are a little bit hard to get used to, a lot of daily missions, really good game for when you're bored. Not many maps, and gamemode gets boring afterthe first half an hour.I wouldn't give 10$ for it, I believe that's too expensive for a game like this.6/10.			"

												For such a simple game, there is a lot to like. Race The Sun provides hours of intense and rapid racing through sci-fi inspired, randomly daily generated worlds. It's also not without its flaws, mostly due to extremely slow developer patching and updating, or lack thereof.Race The Sun is great in short bursts, even though it may also be enjoyed for a couple hours at a time. It's not that it becomes repetitive and boring, it's that it becomes frustrating, as once you've advanced past ten or so regions, it quickly becomes very difficult and demanding of your reflexes. Being that some of us aren't cheating and aren't that young anymore, keeping up with the top of the leaderboard can be a daunting task. Since the world is regenerated and the leaderboard reset for each day, the competition is usually fresh and there's always a new challenge awaiting you. You don't need to play every day to have fun. It's this natural ""pick up and play"" aspect of Race The Sun that is most enjoyable. Sometimes you can't seem to do very well in a certain generated world. Other times, you'll be able to finish the day in the top ten and feel accomplished. Because of these daily variations, the game never gets old.Unfortunately, there are some major problems that have never been addressed as of yet, and even though the developers have acknowledged the need for patching and updating the major problems, there hasn't been any actual progress. The leaderboards have been malfunctioning, or sometimes completely broken since release, and nothing has been done about it so far. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it becomes so bugged that your scores and dates will become scrambled and confused, only to apparently go back to normal next time you play the game. There is very little point in playing a score attack game when the leaderboards are often not working properly or not working at all. The other problem with the leaderboards comes with cheating. The developers have mentioned an eventual replay system for the highest scores in order to discourage some players' cheating ways. Sadly, as I've already mentioned, the major patch and update is still nowhere to be found, even though these major problems have been present since release.It may seem like this review's complaints outnumber compliments, but in reality, even with its major flaws, Race The Sun really is a fun game. Even if it never gets fixed, I still plan on keeping it installed and going back to it every once in a while. It's probably the best of the genre right now. Too bad it's imperfect.Race The Sun is good.			"

												Got it for free, played for about a half-hour, and I don't recommend it. It's neat at first but past Region 1 the plane controls feel too slugglish and unresponsive to handle the obstacles coming up. The freedom of it, there being many paths to take, is hard to enjoy when it feels like I'm losing in the second Region because I took the wrong path. The ""tasks"" system is neat, I enjoyed doing them, but it's not enough to keep me playing the same section of map over and over. Maybe I'm approaching it the wrong way but a waypoint sytem, some alternate game modes (I guess there are some I can unlock that are fun but I'm not going to frustrate myself to get them), and a more responsive plane would do wonders for my enjoyment. As is, I would say pass on it. Might just not be my thing though.			"

												 got this game for free, and unfortunately, that's all it's worth. There's not enough to this game to write a long review on, let alone pay $10 for. You're just dodging obstacles left and right as long as you can. You can collect certain power ups or upgrades to help you last longer and the map changes daily, but that's about all there is to this game. If you can get it for free and you have time to kill, maybe get this game-but I cannot recommend anyone spending money on this.			"

												Very interesting concept and execution. The game is as described in its blurb on its store page. You're a spacecraft racing the sun. The game mechanics are similar to the now classic Bit.Trip.Runner, however this has more of a ""rogue"" element. When you die, you go right back to the beginning of the ""run"", so even if you've cleared 3 stages, you go back to the start. I've not logged a lot of time into this game yet, but I am finding it quite enjoyable and is definitely something I see myself coming back to for short bursts. The graphics and music are minimalist, but pleasing to the eye and ears.  It's already causing rage quits and if you're like me and enjoy torturing yourself with games like this, its definitely a worthwhile play. I can't suggest it at it's current $9.99 pricepoint, but if it appears in a bundle or goes on sale, its something you should consider if you enjoy these type of games. Another aspect that sets this apart is that the worlds are procedurally generated so the game changes all the time. Unlike the aforementioned Bit.Trip.Runner, memorization does not help you, you have to be quick and on your toes. I played with a 360 controller and found it to be the best way to control the ship.

												UPDATE: Since my purchase in 2013, Race the Sun have added near-PERFECT virtual reality support. You can play this game with your Oculus Rift DK1 or DK2... and yeah, it's as bloody awesome as one could imagine. Just one more reason to go ahead and get this game now! (See links at the bottom of review for VR video)Being a big fan of SpeedX 3D and AiRace speed on the 3DS, this game looked like a direct variation of this genre which made my decision to get this title easy. The only question mark was if Tridef Ignition could output this game in proper stereoscopic 3D and sure enough, it works perfectly with it! The more I play it and discover its rather unique features the more I think it'll eventually be worth doing a follow up review with more detail - this game is awesome and people should know about it!Oculus Rift gameplay:http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=WzZmwuYWqAoStereo 3D gameplay (Tridef Ignition):http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=rFhvD3YYkgg "

												I want to recommend this game. But I cant. The developers, despite what I'm sure were good intentions, have made the game - if not  impossible  to play, then at least annoying to the extreme. Flippfly appears to have little regard for player imput, or indeed, play choice in how to play the game. They have implemented sounds that, if you find them annoying as I do, and want to turn them off - too bad. You'll have to turn off all game sound to mute the whiring, overheated computer fan sound of your engine. But I can deal with that. No, the reason for the negative review is the breaking of the game by compulsory community maps. I'm all for community participation in games, but when you are  forced  to play maps off the workshop, the game becomes frustrating and broken. They are either overcomplicated, unintuitive, or simply completely broken - one places you in what I imagine the creator was a ""cinematic"" view, which has the kind of serious flaw of completely dislocating you from your ships position, resulting in crashes where you thought you shouldn't have been.Despite continual complaints against this forced participation and lack of player adjustablity, Flippfly has refused to even acknowledge there is a problem. If and when they fix these issues, I'll more than happily recommend this game to any-and-everyone. Until then, though, I can only recommend it if you're looking for a frustrating, unoptimizable, and, as a product of the two, broken game.			"

												Addictive due to the levelling and achievements, but the game's control system is too sluggish for my liking. I just don't feel like I'm in control, it's similar to Wipeout on the old Playstation in that it's about pressing a direction for the right amount of time while your ship drifts just the right amount to score the perfect position. I think I would have enjoyed this game a lot more if the controls were as sharp as Super Hexagon.The other problem is that it's faced paced and death heavy but takes ages to start again after crashing, like the punishment for dying is a long and frustrating wait.

												The strength of this game is its simple mechanics: left, right, avoid, collect, jump. But that's it. Everything else becomes either boring, annoying and/or impossible after a few hours of gameplay. The first level that you been through at least 10 times? Waiting X hours to play new levels? Achievement ""Do gazillion hard things in single run""? Do these ring a bell?Seriously, don't increase achievements difficulty to ""virtually & masochistically impossible"", add new ones instead. Let the player choose when he wants to play a new set of levels. Or even better: download ""Voxel Rush"" and play a few rounds. You will know right away why said game is more satisfying than Race The Sun. The key elements are: randomness, difficulty, game flow. One game has these, the other doesn't.In the end you decide which game is which. With your wallet, of course. Having bought Race The Sun for approx 1 euro I don't consider it a waste of money. But in my opinion, it's not worth anything more than that.			"

												Fun, despite the minimalistic looks it's not a ""look at me I have no textures I'm so artistic"" type of game. It's lifespan is quite short and almost instantly forgettable if you have nobody from your friendlist to race with. Typical seasonal game that is very fun while it lasts among your friends when a free key giveaway kicks in somewhere, but doesn't really stand a chance to have the same active players on the next week. Some 80's retro electro songs are recommended to listen during play!			"

												Do you like mindless repetition? Then you\'ll love this game! I was bored to tears within 15 minutes, and I\'ve tried the game a couple of times since then, but there simply isn\'t any content. Or rather, there is, but it\'s hidden behind a wall of perfection you will never see. Let me explain:Race The Sun is an infinite runner in the most vanilla sense of the genre. Press start > move left and right > get as many score multipliers as you can > run in to something or go too slow > repeat from the beginning. The problem with this model is that there is no progression; in a little over an hour of gameplay I\'ve seen Region 3 twice and, of course, Region 1 every single time I\'ve died (which must have been 60+ times). You will be bored to tears by Region 1, but you\'ll be forced to play it over, and over, and over again.There is a levelling system, but it takes a ridiculously long time to level up, as they require events during the level that are down to pure luck as to whether you can pull them off. The levels may be \""procedurally generated\"" to some degree, but you will the same chunks of obsticles over and over, and while the location may be different, the order is the same. The moment you make some progress and feel curiosity for the first time in a while, you\'ll die and get sent back to Repetition Land. The price is absurd for what free mobile games do better, and the artsy style will not be enough after your fifteenth death.			"

												I picked this up on a free day.A simple yet mesmerising race type game.  I wasnt sure I liked it at first some of the leveling up was hard and detracted from the fun of the race, but once you get to level 25 you miss the goals. I keep coming back to play this since the script generated maps change on a daily basis. I am quite enjoying it and some of the user generated levels are quite a realaxing fun change from the sphincter clenching fun of the race.It feels simple enough while generating many hours of enjoyment. I would recommend this on sale.			"

												Race the Sun is a fun little game that acts as a good reactionary trainer and the art style reminds me of Star Fox.The downside of the game is that there is only one level.  But the upside is that a new version of the level is procedurally generated every day.  This is refreshing feature that can make me come back to the game to test my reflex skills.I like the minimalist art style and that the level is broken down into several regions with increasing difficulty. What I don’t like is the simplicity of the gameplay; there needs to be more pick-ups, ship abilities and controller buttons to press. With the Steam Workshop there might be some cool user levels to add variety.  But most people will get bored of this game quick, including me.  If you want to play this game you should wait for a bargain sale because you will probably only get a couple hours of fun.  Race the Sun is a good game, but it’s one of those PC games best served on a tablet to pass the time.  If this game gets touch screen support I will recommend it because the simplistic game mechanics can be justified.			"

												I don't really understand the point of this game. Only purpose of this game is to get a higher score on a daily changing leaderboard and complete specifics tasks to gain levels, but that's it.All levels are randomized on a daily basis, so you can't rely on your memory. It gets tedious and boring after couple of hours. Music is bland, forgettable with no variation. Graphics are too simplistic. Controls have a heavy input lag (slightly gets better with an upgrade).The way upgrades are given out is not really rewarding despite needing to complete challenges. New challenges are only given out if you complete the previous ones and die... so you don't actually want to race fast and far, but rather do tedious tasks and get all upgrades.			"

												This is the skiing game I used to play on my calculator in school, but with  better  graphics. This simple concept worked well to provide brief entertainment on-the-go, but fails to shine on a home PC capable of doing so much more. On top of this, I found the controls to be loose and not responsive enough. I sincerely don't understand how this game could be so well-reviewed. It's overly simple, lacking in vision, and above all boring as anything.			"

												This game looks like it could be fun for a couple minutes, maybe a half hour if you really like the style.That's pretty much all I can say about it seeing as how I can't play it at an FPS above 3. I'll be the first to say that my computer has a bunch of issues going on right now so it shouldn't be considered a standard, but I'm able to play Skyrim on low settings at an FPS of at least 30. That being said, I put the settings of this game to ""fastest"" (because even the MENU was laggy!) and I still couldn't play it because it kept freezing up like a rusty roller coaster. REALLY FAST FOR A SEC-- stop... OND THEN IT GOES AN-- stop... D STOPS.This game has absolutely no business lagging the way it does. If it was a graphically intensive game I could understand that, but this game doesn't even have any textures, and some of it is in fact wire-frame. Duke Nukem 3D is more pleasing to look at and it's probably the most optimised game I own on this computer.I'm sure this game probably runs well for a lot of people, but I think it should run well for everyone considering how simplistic everything is. That IS the goal of this style, right? I understand a lot of people think this looks good, but for it to look like this AND play terribly makes it feel incredibly lazy. I'm glad I got this game for free; I would consider paying even just a couple cents too much.This game is not recommended. Just play Star Fox for the Super Nintendo if you're in it for the style, or F-Zero if you're in it for the speed. Everything looks about the same, it feels better, and you'll actually be able to play it instead of trying to reverse engineer the damn thing to try to get it to function.			"

												You can unlock new game modes and upgrades by levelling up. In order to level up, you have to complete missions like ""Score 10,000 points"", ""Collect 10 Tris"", etc.I'm currently stuck at ""Only turn left for 2 courses in 1 round"". The first course isn't a problem at all, but the second course is full of obstacles which make you turn left and right to avoid walls.So, why don't I try it again tomorrow? I mean, the game clearly says that the courses get reset every 24 hours so you keep getting challenged.But that's the point: I started playing the game 3 days ago. I played it everyday. And it's still the same. The game doesn't get supported anymore and I'm sitting here, doing exactly the same 3 courses everyday until I can't progress any further because I haven't unlocked any useful upgrades yet.			"

												tl;dr - Audio Version: https://soundcloud.com/econaelgaming/review-racethesunRace the Sun is a beautifully crafted game with an appealing aesthetic.Sadly the great polish of game mechanics doesn't bring a similar level of polish of the game's design.Race the Sun is an endless runner with an infinitely wide world and it disincentivizes lateral movement by making it dangerous.The theme is that you're steering a solar powered glider and the sun is going down quickly, making shadows longer.There are pickups that push the sun back up and give you a speed boost.These pickups have a big ray that goes into the sky, showing where they are, but the draw distance is so low, that when you see them, you need to instantly do a full steer in that direction to get it and if there's an obstacle close to you forcing you to stay put for a second, you'll miss it.There is only 1 level that is freshly generated once a day.These things coupled together, mean that optimal play includes trial & error to find the optimal path that connects as many of said powerups and memorization of that path.The game uses a progression via small achievements, similar to games such as Jetpack Joyride and these achievements unlock new game mechanics (powerups, game modes etc.).Gating content behind achievements always means that most of those achievements are boring, so as to not hide a big percentage of content from players, so the game has lots of ""Reach X amount of cumulative distance traveled"" or ""Crash X times"" achievements. On top of that, the text upon reaching an achievement is a nihilistic ""meh, achievements suck anyway and you're stupid for caring about points"" type of ""humorous"" text.I unlocked a harder game mode that has repeated the same ~20 seconds of level over and over. I believe it would repeat endlessly. Not appealing.So it's still very beautiful and the controls feel nice, but there's not a lot of game behind it.			"

												If you are into boring and monotonous games, then look no further. Repetive landscapes, and you make use of 3 keys. That's it. Extremely boring. You get very simple abilities that you slowly acquire by completing simple and pointless challenges as you make your run.Cool concept, unfortunately for this specific game, I can't recommend. I tried giving it a fair shot, but there's truely nothing special about this game.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. It just feels lacking in too many areas for me to recommend.My first complaint is how slow the game feels. Right off the bat you might think I'm crazy as the game seems to make you think it's all about speed. However, the slow, drifty turning, the painful wait times between regions and the floatiness in the air seems to slow the game down dramatically. Try playing something like Super Hexagon, which has very snappy, precise controls and you'll see what I mean. The worst contributor to the pace of the game, though, is the time it takes between dying and starting a new game. Everything about this game tells me it's trying to be a fast, addictive game that players can lose themselves in for hours on end. When I die, I should immediately be playing again in less than 1 second. The way it is now, the game shows a death animation for a second, then shows the score screen with some achievements for another second, then goes to an intro screen with a quote that is displayed long enough to read, the player swoops in, then there is still a few seconds before the player reaches any obstacles they need to avoid. Most of this could be cut out and the game would be so much more playable!The game doesn't have many new interestng mechanics, either. Tiny Wings (another achievement-based arcade game with a near-identical plot) had it's physics-based jumping mechanic. Time Surfers added to the Tiny Wings formula by adding the time-reversing mechanic. This just feels like a driftier, slower, blander version of cubefield, a flash game made 4 years ago. The only new idea I haven't seen anywhere else is the mechanic where flying in shadows slows you down, which is essentially adding extra danger to the already-existing obstacles instead of introducing something new for the player to actively do. Everything else in the game seems to be following the achievement-based mobile game formula.I'm typically a gameplay-focused guy who doesn't care about visuals or sound, but I found them getting in the way of my enjoyment of this game. I understand the developers were going for a minimalist look, only using colors for pickups, but the environment just comes off as bland and unattractive. It just looks like default diffuse Unity shaders. The lighting effects where the shadows grow longer as the sun goes down is a neat mechanic that combines the art/environment with the gameplay, but it also highlights another problem: the draw distance. I often ran into situations where large objects would pop into view way later than I should have been able to see them, especially after the sun was starting to set. Again, I understand that the game is supposed to become more challenging as the sun is setting, making it harder for the player to see and making the game more tense as a result. However, I only felt cheated as I couldn't tell the distance between an unavoidable horizontal object that popped in too late and a shadow. Adding color to the environment would probably have helped this immensely, but instead the gray of the objects and the gray of the shadows just blend together too much.Moving into sound, I was turned off by the music after only a few playthroughs. Every game plays the exact same song! The little jingle that plays when you beat a region is, in my opinion, very annoying and even now I hear it ringing in my ears. Looking at Super Hexagon again, there were 2 songs for each of the ""3"" difficulties and the starting point in each song was moved around so they sounded different each time you played. It sounded like there was a lot more variation then there was, adding extra life to the already amazing soundtrack. This game's song started off kind of flat and its repetition only made worse over time.Going back to mechanics, I want to discuss the procedural generation. I think part of the pitch for this game was to have a new procedurally generated level every day so players can compete for the top score on that specific level. When the next day comes around, the winner of the top score for the previous day will remain the victor for eternity and everyone gets to compete again on a new level from a clean slate. This concept sounds very interesting and I commend the developers for trying it, but I don't think it worked in practice. If this is a skill/reflex based game, the level layout doesn't really have all that much to do with the score. Sure, if the level was the same every time, professionals would quickly figure out the optimal path and only minute changes would allow a player to come out on top, setting the new best path. Supposedly, having a new level each day is setting up a similar scenario without giving players enough time to memorize the difinitive best path. Furthermore, since the games can become very long, stretching up to 10+ regions in a row, the number of paths increases exponentially to a ridiculous number as the game goes on. Does memorizing the optimal path in the first region really give the player an edge after surviving 10 regions in a row? Is it even possible to memorize the optimal path through the first 5 regions and remember your score after each one to see if that path was really optimal? Is there a point in doing so if the game is going to reset in a day anyway? What I'm getting at here that I don't see the point in keeping the level the same each day. I would rather have  each level procedurally generated every time I start a new game. It's supposed to be skill based anyway, right? The players who are most skilled will probably be at the top of the leaderboard each day anyway, so why not just procedurally generate each run and reset the scores every day. The chance of generating an ""easier"" level and giving a player an easier chance of getting a high score isn't very likely with all of the possible variation and it would all be balanced out over multiple plays anyway. At my low skill level where I'm dying consistently in Region 3, I get very sick of seeing the same starting point of Region 1 over and over. I have very little interest in improving my skills when the game starts off the same way every single time. It's like starting over at World 1-1 of Mario every time you die; it's so easy but I have to sit through the same thing to get to the interesting parts.I didn't get through enough of the game to get more customization options than the magnet, so there is probably a LOT more depth to the game I am missing. Unfortunately the game has not held my interest to get me up to that point. It's such a shame; I was very excited for this game as an avid fan of fast, level/achievement-based arcade games (Time Surfers, Tiny Wings, Super Hexagon to a degree, Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride, etc). I'll try it for a bit longer, but as of right now I can't recommend this game.			"

												Love this game. I'd go as far as calling it strategic but not to the point you can memorize every region and breeze through, even with a general idea of the landscape, each run will bring a new obstacle you may not have encountered before.This game provides a challenge without being incredibly difficult to pick up on, and when it starts to get intense, the soundtrack will pick up and all the narrow misses will send a jolt of adrenaline through your body.With all this being said, I have encountered the corrupt save file bug, not once, but twice. Both seemingly after computer restarts (while game was shut down and not active in anyway).For this alone, I cannot recommend this game to anyone as this is a huge bug that get's rid of any progress you have made. This happened the day I bought the game, I can't imagine having played it for a week and then lost all of my upgrades and power ups which change the whole dynamic of the game.Until this bug is fixed, you are essentially playing a game that resets every day.

The initial concept sounds OK, but the game quickly becomes boring.I bought the game because I read somewhere that its indie authors weren't happy with the sales. Yes, I'm an idiot.

												As with Fotonica, the controls feel much too stiff for what’s demanded of you***.Horror games (of old) upped the tension by implementing poor controls; ""Oh, you want to run with gun-drawn? It wouldn't be a horror game if we allowed that, though, hmm? Be terrified of our game mechanics, rather than of what's actually in the game!""I'm starting to think that with games like Fotonica, Race the Sun and Avoid Sensory Overload, ("")poor("") controls (or should I say “lacking,” as, in these games, the controls ARE tight) are also seen as necessity, to, what, (artificially) lengthen the games? Doubt I conveyed that appropriately but perhaps you could comprehend, still.Of those games, I feel that Race the Sun is the worst offender; hence, *Thumbs Down*Now that that's out of the way:Race the Sun could be summed up: Such stress; much shade; fast, so.Every day, the track is generated anew. There are milestones to accomplish. These grant you “Knowledge” (of which, there doesn’t seem to be a record; you better remember what you learned the first time you learned it!) and sometimes Powers, i.e. a Magnet that allows you to pull the collectibles to you from further away, an increased carrying capacity for the Jumps (so you can double-jump), etc. Simple game that is not. It is not really worth the asking price but it is worth looking into if you lack that daily dose of adrenaline. ***More than anything, it feels that, if you intend to have an awesome run, it’s purely based on luck. Maybe I’m just bad but I cannot fathom what sort of skill would be required to be able to maneuver between the sets of obstacles in this game, to reach those long lines of Tri’s (collectibles), especially since the ship seems so heavy and one must struggle with momentum even upon barely changing direction. Just throw your ship to one side and hope you can squeeze through – there’s no such thing as being able to anticipate and react and maneuver quick enough.			"

												This game is amazingly fun and incredibly addictive. Although this game is technically a racing game, it barely fits the criteria for being in the genre. I've typically disliked most racing games, but this one is super fun. This game is very addictive and will make you tell yourself ""just one more time, then I'm done"" more times than you can count. In this game, you are, literally, racing the sun - when you stay in the dark for too long, you die. As the sun goes down, the shadows cast by the various objects become your worst enemy, making things increasingly difficult to survive. The developers implemented a leveling system, giving you access to several powerups and decals for your plane for completing various objectives - namely things like ""score X amount of points"" or ""don't turn left through 1 region"". Although basic, the leveling system adds a fun incentive for replayability. This game has been well-designed and I recommend buying it, even at full price. If you manage to find it on sale, then it is a steal.			"

												PLAY IN A FIRST PERSON VIEW MODE!Race the Sun is a game about collecting seagulls poop and unlocking colourful worlds, next to magical powers. It is a futuristic racing game, a good one. It is fast, it is furious, it is abstract, there is a sense of humour in it, there are even philosophical tidbits. But first of all, there are advancement levels to be gained through solving challenges, as well as additional achievements to be reached for, with plenty of emotions to be had along the way. Obtaining further levels opens road to the technological implementations and features, which empower the experience and final score. Eventually new modes of play are enabled.The game looks conceptually coordinated with the solar craft riding against the setting sun, the death-timer. The action is placed within an Egyptian-like minimalistic desert environment. Nevertheless, there are also beautiful side-worlds to be discovered - milk and honey, if you are persistent and lucky. Speaking of the basic map, a new scheme is generated each day, with a new leaderboard to be settled for it.Race the Sun is perhaps a perfect speedrunning game in the futuristic abstract tone with minimalist design style. 8/10 wHATs grade. Definitely recommendable to those who want to feel the vibe of screen image shaking under the impact of acceleration.			"

												Erase The Fun™I want to like this game, but usually end up rage-quitting after about 5 minutes... The game looks very pretty, but the controls are extremely limited. While the forward motion of the ship gives an incredible sense of speed, the steering is quite sluggish. It's more about methodically picking your line than making snap reactions. When the ship can't even come close to keeping up to where I expect it go, and it once again smashes into some obstacle that I could see coming for miles (but still couldn't avoid) the frustration negates any fun I was managing to have.

												Race the Sun is a simple but addicting twitcher. The regions introduce new elements at a learnable pace, and levelling up never feels like a chore. Apocalypse mode is a literal blast, and the leaderboards will have you pushing for that horizon as often as you can.User-created worlds, a randomized daily world, and fun achievements make for great daily play. If you want a game that you know you'll keep coming back to, this is a great choice.			"

												Dang it... Died again while writing this review... This a load of fun. Forget the fact that the game feels like you are flying at 800mph. Forget the fact that people can make there own custom maps that others can fly in. Forget the fact that you need to stay in the sunlight to keep flying. Forget the fact that there is a mode that you will die in 5 seconds in. But... the freaking candle on this cake of a game is that the maps change every 24 hours. I'm so glad that they did this because let's face it, it would be boring seeing the same thing...every...single...time. Random generation is one of my personal favorite things in a game cause it beings a certain life to the game. It's just one heck of a good time.			"

The challenges used to get new unlocks get repetative, and the game only has so much to offer.I'd recommend it, and encourage people to play it sparingly. It's a good game that deserves to be played, but you won't be sitting at this for a whole weekend, burning hours.			"

												(English is not my native language, my appologies for the mistakes)  Race the sun is a highly addictive game to begin with. Wich is..good right? Your goal is to go through the levels without smashing youself into obstacles or running out of solar energy if you stay in the shadows too long or if you're not fast enough to keep up with the sunset. There are boosts, jumps, second lifes and probably other ''pick ups'' that i haven't unlocked yet wich makes it even more challenging..Speaking of challenges, there is always three challenges that you have to beat to get new ones and to level up. You can also customize your ship with attachments and decals that you unlock. Personnal impressions: When i play this game i feel a bit like when i was playing Starfox back then on my snes. Do barrel rolls,dodge obstacles and stuff like that. I would recommand it to everyone. Play turn by turn with friends on the same computer is something i do a lot with this game and its real fun! ^^  Or just brag about how fast and far you went!!  A challenge of reflexes!   A must have.			"

												This game reminds me a lot of the original Star Fox, but without the shooting part. It is very beautiful for being such a simple looking game. What makes it really interesting is that the main level design gets changed every 24 hours so there is a new challenge everyday. The objective of the game is to go as far as possible before the sun sets or you crash. The game uses only the left and right arrow keys and the space bar, which makes it very simple to play, but it also supports controllers. Most of the user created levels are very good and do things you wont see in the main game. I highly recomend this game.			"

Race The Sun is an absolutely awesome game for all you speed freaks out there, if the normal mode isn't fast enough for you, there're levels on the Workshop that'll have you going too fast to think. Race The Sun's simplicity is excellent, the fact that the only goal is to keep moving forward makes it so easy to get into, but hard to become the best. You will be swearing at your screen because of this game, but hours of joy come with it.			"

												Very fun. Calm, yet challenging. I would only play it for maybe 20 minutes each day - because the map refreshes once a day. The challenges used to get new unlocks get repetative, and the game only has so much to offer.I'd recommend it, and encourage people to play it sparingly. It's a good game that deserves to be played, but you won't be sitting at this for a whole weekend, burning hours.			"

												I personnaly really like this game. You can say that the challenges given by the game for unlocks can become repetitive after a while but i don't think it really is a problem seeing that the game isn't made to be played hours on end. However, the workshop and tools provided to create levels as well as the daily change of the level really help to add content.I'd say this game is well worth your money if you like the genre and the aesthetic. Works perfectly fine with keyboard and mouse but i would still recommend playing with a controller if you can because the movemement feels better with one.			"

												Race the sun is an action packed arcade feeling game that you can pick up and just play. The fast paced action allows for players to feel the speed and intensity of racing to the horizon of the map dodging obstacles that lie ahead. the gameplay is very smooth and controller support adds that extra controll to the game. the overall map layout could be a bit more colourful but other than that this game wants you to try and get that high score. overall i would rate this a 9.5/10 because it is a great game and i really recomend it to players of all ages and skills			"

												Race the sun is a simple racing game. You have only one objective; max out your score by surviving as long as possible.There is a little more to it than that though. Your craft is solar-powered, so if you stray into the shadows for too long, you will slow down dramatically, letting the sun go down. And the sun moves real fast when you aren't chasing it at full speed.The objects that create the shadows make their own problems that you have to deal with. Your craft cannot survive a direct hit into any object, making every game tense, giving a thrill and adrenaline rush each time you play. (You can survive hitting something from the side, but that slows you down)Along the way, you will find a variety of pick-ups which will boost your score multiplier,boost your speed so fast that the sun actually moves backwards, gives you a second chance, warps you to another world ect... These pickups add a layer of strategy into the game other than 'just avoid hitting that.' Do you want to boost your multiplier and risk hitting that mountain? Or play it safe and get the jump powerup off to the side? These choices have to be made very fast, ramping up the adrenaline rush every time a rushed choice is made.And every time you fail, the 'Just one more try' itch will pop up again. Every time.One thing that many people will complain about is the art style of the game. As can be easily seen from the trailer, everything is cubes and pryamids with the odd barely spherical sphere rolling along. So it doesn't look realistic at all, but that doesn't really matter. All you know it that there is stuff in your way, and you gotta dodge it.Every day the map will change. That does not mean that Race The Sun is procedrually generated, but is rather a mix of randomly placed tiles placed in a mix-matcked pattern. This makes each 'section' that you speed through familiar, but still reletively new.Finally, there is a small leveling system in the game which slowly makes the game more complicated as you play it. At first, there are no powerups, only score boosters. These are introduced as challenges are completed, as well as attatchments for your craft. These attatchment include; magnetic reach for pick-ups, faster turning speed, more storage for pickups, durability in the shade and even decals for the crafts wings.So, Race The Sun appears to be simple on the front cover, but it gets more and more complex as time goes on. Similar to expansion packs for card games and the like.			"

												A good randomly generated racing game. Although given the high-speed style, it might be more accurate to call it an endless runner / high-speed reaction game. The idea of mixing an endless runner with one that randomly changes is quite a good one. It gives you enough time to practice and perfect a race through, while using the random generation to prevent it becoming monotonous.The levels that are generated look very nice. It all has a minimalistic look to it, but there are specific styles of level that are created. You do begin to start to no longer notice the appearance and instead see everything as just obstacle / clear area.There isn't all that much to the game itself. It's quite simple. You can unlock new modifiers to play with, or use content from the workshop, but there will come a point when you've exhausted all that.I would tend to say that this is a good game. It's quite simple at its core, but it is a good endless runner / racing game.			"

This is the game I pick up when I just want to chill out, then I suddenly find my heart racing as I've made it through several perfect stages and getting way too excited. Somehow though, I never seem to get frustrated, the game just doesn't strike that nerve and for that it is one of my all time favourites.			"

												Race the sun is a relaxing fast pase game where you must avoid obsticles to progress further in levels.  It is a great game to play when wanting to just relax, with the maps changing daily.  A great game, though I suggest you pick it up when it is on sale, because the $10 price tag is a lot for what feels like a phone app.			"

												This has to be one of the quickest and most fast paced games I have ever played. The hardware you need to play is minamal and it never gets old because the levels reset every 24hrs. The more you play the more perks you unlock. So if you have played enough you will start off the game with a 3x multiplier instead of 1x and im sure there are other things that you can unlock later that I do not know of. The way you rank up is you complete challenges such as turn right through 1 region or collect 150 tris (blue triangles). If you have $10 this game is a must get.			"

												After way too many hours of this game, I think I can finally write a review that does the game justice.First off, you should watch both trailers so that you understand a little bit about how the game looks by watching someone play it.  They both sum up what things look like very well.  I'll write my review first from a mechanics aspect and end with an aesthetic aspectControls:The controls for race the sun are very simple and, I think, intuitive.  Arrow keys make you turn right and turn left; Space bar is jump.  They are remapable though I'm not sure I would ever want to.  Controllers are supported, but the game plays just fine with the arrow keys.  I'm pretty twitchy from playing shooters and RTS though.  You can tap the arrow key at varying speeds and get performance similar to a joystick or controller.  I've never found the controls to blame for any of my deaths after about the first 15 minutesLearning curve:Race the Sun introduces a leveled progression throughout this otherwise arcade style game.  Your first run is very simple: Dodge things, and try to hit the yellow speed boosts.  As you advance, power-ups like jumps, world portals, emergency portals (a get out of dying free card) and even portals that instantly warp you to the end of that level start to appear.  You level up in an interesting way: by completing challenges that the game poses for you, ranging from simple (like jumping 10 times) to complex, like only turning left for two regions (levels) in a run.  You have three at any time, and the simpler ones are often worth less, but makes it so that you can always progress.  By introducing these new features one at a time, you can get to grips with the new one instead of the game dropping a lot of confusing stuff on your head.Customization:Another consequence of the leveling system is that the game rewards you with mods for your flyer.  They do a variety of things from increasing the amount of jumps you can hold, to letting you grab power ups from farther away, to turning faster.  It's a nice way to tailor your craft to how you like to play. Additionally, you'll get the ability later on to choose multiple to equip.Procedural Content Generation:The levels in Race the Sun are procedurally generated.  Under normal circumstances, this would probably be infuriating, because every time you crashed you'd have to learn a new world (you'll crash often).  However, Race the Sun generates the same world for everyone, probably based on number sequence for each day to act as the seed for the generator.  There's no  downloads involved, and you can play instantly when you boot up the game or play offline anytime.  Since the levels are generated, you can also go as far right or left as you want.  Graphics:Simple, yet good enough.  Shadows are dynamic based on the height of the sun, and actually imact the play of the game.  After all, your craft is solar powered.  Most things are simple hedron shapes, but it looks good enough that the graphics don't ever distract me.  Besides, since the sun is always in front of you, you usually only see the dark side of objects.  Occasionally you can blind yourself in the sunlight (it halos nicely when you're staring straight into it) obscuring things around you but is never bright enough to actually blind you.Gameplay:I think the game is fun as hell.  As you can figure from the youtube trailer, you move FAST.  You will miss things by next to nothing. You'll crash often trying to catch that one speed boost that you know you can't make and it will only be your fault.  I've never found myself blaming the game for a death.  The games are the perfect length to hop on and play one between doing other things.  10/10: Perfect execution on what it set out to do.  Doesn't try to do too much.  Looks good, plays better. "

												It does exactly as described. You fly forward, collect triangle and yellow things, avoid smashing into things, and try to go as long as you can before the sun sets and you die.Simple, minimalistic. It will probably make you ragequit at least a few times. I myself can only play a couple rounds at a time to just not stress out over how bad I am at the game. Yet, it can be pretty relaxing depending on the mood you're in.It's a fun diversion, and worth the money to me.

												Great time killer if you're looking for a nice game to play for a few mintes.In Race The Sun, you fly a solar ship, race to the end of each level while dodging all the obstacles in your way, collect points and power ups for high scores and helpful assists, all while racing the sun as it slowly sets, until you're stranded in the darkness.There's also a custom level creator and plenty of levels made by the community for even more fun!However, I will add a rage warning to this... Can get quite frustrating after a while, so I don't recommend playing while in a bad mood or in long bursts. Like I said, this is a great time killer, but it's best to quit after a while to settle your nerves, then pick it back up again when you're calm.In the end, I highly recommend this game!			"

												As someone who is relatively new to gaming (and thus, appropriately bad at it to boot), I found this an easy game to get into. Not only that, but it keeps you challenged, as the world is - due to its being generated / reset regularly - very dynamic. The visuals are quite pretty: lots of room to roam / fly, with soothing music playing in the background. Moreover, the game is a great way to vent -- sometimes crashing into buildings is just the thing you need to forget about RL stress :D.			"

												SUMMARY: Race the Sun is as great as an endless runner can get, with its unique use of shadows, highly diverse designs for the levels and how they work together to effect gameplay really works great to make some really fun, intense gameplay. While Race the Sun is at its heart still a mobile game, it feels good, looks good and works good with many steam features added like achievements and workshop. BUT, make sure you are into endless runners, the 10 bucks for this is still very steep price point that is most likely for you better spent somewhere else. if you can find this for half off or less, the game would start to be worth it for me.ENDLESS RUNNER: Race the sun has great level design, changing every level to keep you on your toes, not knowing what to expect the futher you go, thus keeping the game fresh for longer. The sun is your clock and the thing that keeps you alive because you are solar powered, when the sun lowers, the shadows grow longer and begin to struggle to keep up with the sun, with this the structures form play a massives role, challenging the player in different ways, making the game sometimes unpredictable. many power ups and points of scattered across the levels to help you move and speed up to keep you racing the sun.GRAPHICS: graphics are pretty simple, making this game able to run on any computer except for maybe computers too old to be useing now and days. in addition, the simple graphics also add to the art style and makes spotting very important power ups easy to spot, allowing you too worry about if you will get there quick enough.OTHER THOUGHTS: the game is kind of cool, not a must buy at all but a good game to fill in that endless runner craving you might get every few months, right next to Fontonica.

												Looking at the screenshots, I didn't expect much with Race The Sun and I was pleasantly surprised. Despite fast and frantic gameplay with an ever-counting timer of doom, the game has a nice, relaxing feel to it. It reminds me a lot of Moonsweeper, one of my favorite games on the Atari 2600 when I was a kid.The graphics, music, and gameplay are all very simple, but in a good way. A few of the challenges (specifically the only right/left turn through a region and the grindier ones) can get a little frustrating and I'm a little disappointed the endless, chill mode with no timer is paid DLC, but overall this is a very good one in the sea of indie garbage on Steam.

Dev did a great job, game looks nice and smooth and plays well. World gen is nice and fluent too. Would recommend to anyone who likes relfex or arcade style games.			"

												Race the Sun is fun, in small doses.  Playing for an extended amount of time will become very frustrating as you plough into cubes, pyramids, and other geometric shapes at high speeds over and over again.  You are given various tasks to complete as you play such as travel a certain distance, and travel a certain distance without hitting anything.  Completing the harder of these tasks levels you up quicker which allows you to complete yet harder tasks.The music isn't too bad either.9/10: Would crash into cubes again.			"

												At the start this game looks pretty straight forward and in a way, kinda boring but remember, never judge a book by it's cover, or a game by it's...title? Whatever. Anyway. Thise game is a fast action racer towards the sun, and of course like it says, it is rather indie! This game in my opinion is very different than other racing like games out there. One thing I like the most about this game is the music, the music of course sets the mood for just the normal gameplay, but once the sun is about to set, that is when it really ""heats"" up! The music gets faster and more intense as you slowly but also get closer towards your very own death! The art style for this game is pretty nice as well, beautful plane/bird and of course, the lighting is outstanding! Hyexo - 8.7/10			"

												OMG YES !!! This is the BEST Indie game that I have bought this year. I was very disappointed with promising games like Ring Runner, but this one is the real hidden gem. It's extremely addictive and despite the very simple and straightforward design, there is an amazing amount of depth to this game. I am digging the unlocks and simple ship configuration. I'm also looking forward to checking out player created worlds as well. The replayability factor is off the charts because the world changes every 24 hours. Are you kidding me? Buy this game NOW.

												This is a great adaption of the ""endless runner"" style of games (Canabolt, Temple Run), into a format that works better with controller and visuals.  Your goal is to pilot a solar-powered ship as far as you can before the sun sets, dodging stationary and fixed obstables on an otherwise minimialistic landscape. All the time your score increases with distance traveled , and picking up special markers can boost that multiplier. The game ends whenever you crash or you run out of sun. The game has a meta-game leveling system based on meeting various objectives like 10000000 or Jetpack Joyride, which grants various abilities and bonuses to help with your race.With recent updates, the game now has a main ""world"" that is regenerated once a day (like Spleunky's daily challenge), as well as support for Workshop and user-based levels, thus giving a good long-run challenge for this.

												This game is so suspenseful it will literally make you flinch every time you just barely avoid death.  One moment you're soaring through the map, avoiding obstacles and getting power-ups and the next you see yourself chargind into a block or spike.  To make it even more exciting, you're solar powered, so you have to get as far as you can as fast as you can before the sun sets & you're out of power.  There will always be 3 achivements to get to move on to the next level.  With each level-up comes new power-ups or stuff added to the game to help you live longer, and more info about the game.  Although it can be frustrating at times, i highly reccoment this game to anyone who loves racing, suspense and going fast.			"

The quick decisions and the gut wrenching close calls every few seconds.I started playing this game when it was free on konglomerate and when it came to Steam I had to buy it. I turn off the sound and the music, turn on my own electronic music and just tune out the rest of the world. It's an engaging and fun game in its simplicity. It will be a part of my gaming life for as long as I have a Steam account. "

												Race The Sun is not a typical ""end-less runner"" game.  The game is so much more.   Each region you pass through increasingly offers greater challenges.   The soundtrack of the game is amazing, it organically fits with the game.   It offers basically unlimited re-playability.  In my personal opinion the game does not get old,  even after goofing up several times, the game lures you in for more and more to get past that region you messed up on.  The game is very entertaining, you will not be disappointed.  Buy this game!!			"

												This is a great little game. One little problem, as a PC gamer it would be a lot better if the left and right controls were A D instead of the arrows. I'm So not used to controling left and right with my right (mouse) hand :p and to be honest I am not going to relearn right and left for this game. I'll check back leter and try again when the controls are where they normaly are in PC games.On the bright side if you've got a game pad you're set!			"

												Race The Sun is a simple game that is entertaining to play while you wait for friends to come online. The goal of the game is to fly your craft as far as you can before the sun hits the horizon.It is quite difficult to complete some of the challenges and can take a good amount of hours before you start to benefit from the ship upgrades. Everyday the main maps randomizes.This mechanic helps to make the maps more interesting. This game also has a great Workshop community that provides extra maps for the game. "

												Fun, challenging and fast. I really like the level editor and the new dlc ""sunrise"", they allow us to make endless levels with no setting sun. This makes it really relaxing until you hop into the race the sun mode again. Race the sun offers a nice gradual challenge that gets way crazier as you go. Once you get better and further you will start to see the first worlds change.  This is a nice game to enjoy the ost or listen to your own tunes in the background while playing. I'm glad I got this during early access, it just reminds me of a couple games on my commodore and 286.			"

												Race The Sun feels like one of those additional games for Journey, with its beautiful gameplay and graphics that just makes you want to look at it. That is until you acturally play and then it feels like the brand new version of cubefield (play cubefield, they are so similar), with all the annoying obsticles that just want to kill you, cuppled with the tricky handling that just makes you want to scream at your computer screen (don't bother, it can't hear you, trust me). However, no matter how hard I tried, I just could not stop playing this brilliant little game, which I will finish no matter what it takes. Highly recommended. 9.5/10			"

												Definitely one of the best games i've played, and is a great game for listening to upbeat and fast music in the background. Just make sure - if you are overly competitive - that you have no talented and better friends that make you chase their highscores night and day. This game is fast (and extremely fast in Apocalypse mode) and entirely based on skill, so if you are terrible, you either have to accept being a noob or wish damnation, tortue and death upon yourself. Either you beat the highscore, or you go to bed crying. I ended up removing it from my library because it endangered my sanity.			"

Also because the map changes every day you can play it without it getting dull and you have a new score to fight for.Just spend three and a half hours, instead of 30 minutes. But at least now I have a better highscore for today.One of the best games I have played in a long time!			"

Race The Sun is a simple and elegant game with beautiful background where you constantly forget your racing time to go places you never thought you could before.

												The game has a very simple concept: you race the sun. The entire game is you travelling horizontally (primarily, you can use jump powerups for a vertical boost, but you never stop moving forwards) until either the sun goes down or you crash into something. Most of the time, you'll crash. The sun can be ""un-set"" with booster pickups, encountered as you move forward. But this just prolongs the inevitable. And I know I'm basically repeating the blurb but this is the entire game, quite simply. It's good, but I don't think it's worth £6.99 (or $9.99, I guess). Get it maybe when it's on sale, but I wouldn't buy it full price.			"

												And awesome high speed game where you take control of an odd plane thing and attempt to glide along this odd land, your plane is solar powered though, so you must collect powerups that cause the sun to go higher into the sky, but in return this makes obstacles come at you faster. This game originated on kongregate, the flash website, and have evolved into easily one of my all time favorite games. With decals, powerups, passive abilities, a workshop, and the infuriating apocolypse mode. And much much more i'd say this game, although slightly overpriced for its content is quite a nice game pick up when its on sale. It also has a ""zen"" mode DLC I plan on purchasing this mode when I can.			"

												Race the sun is the kind of game you are more likely to play when you end up having some free time to kill.Understand here : When you are waiting for the turkey you put in the oven to be ready.It's fairly easy to play, a bit harder to master, addictive and frustrating.- Easy to play : Indeed, you just have to doge some ""super-structure"", grab some ""power-up"", not let the sun set.- Hard to master : Reaching zone 10 is hard, so is surviving apocalypse mode.- Addictive and frustrating : Typical of the classical ""Die and Retry"". You will try over and over until you reach your ""achievements"".But the most frustrating part isn't about dying few points away from the 1M ... It's about letting the turkey in the oven for too long.			"

It give you a powerful feeling of speed and risk as you make your way to the end of each region. Every time you crash it just gives you more drive to reach that next area and see what else is in store for you. The game is ever changing and everyday it is something new. Never gets old!

												Race The Sun is not a typical ""end-less runner"" game.  The game is so much more.   Each region you pass through increasingly offers greater challenges.   The soundtrack of the game is amazing, it organically fits with the game.   It offers basically unlimited re-playability.  In my personal opinion the game does not get old,  even after goofing up several times, the game lures you in for more and more to get past that region you messed up on.  The game is very entertaining, you will not be disappointed.  Buy this game!!			"

												I'll give it a thumbs up.  This is a simpler game, but I think that's what makes it good.  It does what it does well, giving you a small plane you have to charge across the landscape while avoiding obsticles and trying to go as far as you can before the sunlight runs out.  Some of the task might need some fine tuning, but it's something you can do a few runs on when you have half an hour and aren't someone that plays solitare.			"

												Relaxing, and fun to play. It is an endless runner where you play as a bird-ship-flying thingie, and as the name suggests you race the sun. Why? Well, you die when you run out of solar power, which is what the sun is eventrually gonna do if you don't kill yourself flying into the geomentry of the levelVERY fun, and VERY fast!EDIT: ONE ♥♥♥♥ING THING THOUGH. The stupid turn left/right only for # regions. HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THAT PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH.Especially because some regions have areas that you NEED to turn left/right if you go the wrong way, which is so easy because you can't TURN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEFT OR RIGHT TO DODGE THOSE AREAS, ARRRRGGGHHHOther than that, it's a fun game!

												This is a great game, ladies and gents. Welcome to the race against time and the sun. Hop into your trusty, solar-powered, plane, Penelope (you can name your plane whatever you want), and dodge, weave and bob your way through a trippy block universe. Collect powerups that stop the sun from setting, jumps and shields. As  you level up there are lots of sweet unlockables you can attach to your ship to make gameplay more interesting. Blast through portals into unknown universes where the laws of physics do not apply. Hit ramps, catch major air, do some barrel rolls.Gameplay is challenging and compelling without the need for fancy graphics. Great use of color and sound to set the mood, Lots of homebrew levels in the workshop for endless replayability.Get this game. You need this game.			"

												This game is best played in first person with stereo headphones. I almost peed myself when I just barely avoided ramming a mountain because it felt like it was right in my face. I have poor depth perception, but this game makes me feel like I have excellent depth perception. Except when I crash in first person. SCARY AS HELL, especially when I'm in the groove. Though, gotta say some of the challenges would be better suited as achievements. One of my challenges right now is to only turn left for two rounds in one life. That is insanely hard, especially since there's areas where I absolutely need to turn right. Excellent idea for an achievement, but terrible for simply leveling up.9/10 game, just get it.

												It's like F-Zero had a child with... Super Hexagon! Very-fast, twitch-control gameplay, very well crafted procedurally generated levels each day with bizzare presentation and level-music. In essense the game revolves around an abstract mechanic of collecting power ups to rotate the planet and extend the amount of time the sun is shining. Why is this even a thing? Because your ship's solar-powered existence depends on it! Remember that Speed movie with Neo in that sometimes comes on around christmas, where the bus can't fall below 50mph or it blows up? This game is variant of this scenario, only the the ship's speed / power is directly dependent on the amount of sunshine available. As soon as the sun starts to set, you're presented with a pinch-style music arrangement that echos the danger you're faced with. Your ship gradually starts to slow down as less and less power becomes available to it from the sunlight. Desperately swerving around crazy moving cubes and obstacles like a level from mario 64 put on a motorway, you're looking for sunlight orbs to extend the day, but ultimately it's futile, as like the music, the levels never end! You're doomed to blow up at some point (provided you're human and need to sleep or die in the future)The Steam version also benefits from having a pretty nifty level-editor and user created content, if that's your kindof thing. I primarily played this game on the PS4 before owning it on Steam however.Like fast racing games, thrill of impact when a mistake is made? the challenge of having to start from the beginning and survive the whole onslaught you just faced just to reveal the mysery of what's encountered round the corner on the next level, like the good old 8 and 16-bit days? This is a game you'll enjoy, and even if you don't you'll have a laugh anyway.			"

												Race The Sun is an exciting racing game that's all about avoiding obstacles, clearing objectives, and getting achievements. It's Single Player only, just like a classic arcade game. The graphics are simple and the sunsets can be beautiful. Despite how it may sound, the only seriously stressful part of the game is the Hardcore mode, Apocalypse. The regular game mode is difficult as well, although not enough to make your smash your game controller or keyboard. I am currently enjoying this little gem immensely.Overall, I rate the game 9/10.

												So... this is one of the most creative, peaceful and very addictive game ive played. To start off I'd have to say i have always enjoyed the 2D game 'Helicopter' that I used to have on my phone when i was 16! This reminds me of that but on a whole new level, now you get to dodge obsticals and feel such an interaction with the awesome power-ups and how they help you travel, more of time and tactful thinking, knowing routes and dicovering new ones to, not to mention the challenges which keep this game even more challenging!I love the creative maps and really appriciate the work put into it's levels, add-ons and music, its a delightful game and im so going to play it now, as talking about it makes me want to play it. overall - Fantastic *****			"

Summary'Race The Sun' is a nice, casual game that is soley based on your reaction time and ability to contemplate potential obstacles. With several pickups along the way such as jumping and extending the timer - essentially the Sun - it makes for a very fast paced yet simple game that makes it such great fun to play. You are able to edit levels, download from Steam Workshop, conquer a vast majority of levels, jump through 'World Portals', gain buffs, alter your ship. In ddition, it is a  beautifully attractive and the mechanics are simple enough to enjoy. It has my recommendation!How does the game work?When entering a level, you are placed outside of a house - a small introduction with nothing but a very simplistic washed out house with the level's name and a small quote underneath that varies from time to time. After a couple of seconds, your ship whizzes in and off you go, fighting against the creeping dark as the Sun declines above the horizon. The objective is to avoid the darkness and to reach the sun as quickly as possible. You are flying a solar ship that is, well... Powered by sunlight. The less time you spend in the Sun, the slower you become until you eventually stop all together.As you stay in the Sun, you progress through the level: dodging and weaving between obstacles: from various towers to small, cube-like blockades. Some of these assets move, some don't. As the levels progress, it becomes more difficult to keep up with the Sun as it becomes darker and darker.The game mechanics are relatively straight forward, making it one of those games were you try to race to the end of the level in an attempt to beat a timer.Powerups?Yup. Powerups. At just under an hour of gameplay time (not much I know) I have managed to unlock two types of powerups: one extends the Sun's time in the sky, thus speeding up your ship and another that allows you to elevate to a reasonable height so you may fly over the obstacles. Both of these have saved - and crushed - my ship all together.The MusicIn games like this, music is important: ranging from a dramatic score to a rather soothing tone depending on what lies ahead. The music in 'Race The Sun' is quite upbeat and dramatic. I enjoy the change per level and the transition between regions. Very nice indeed.ConclusionDefinitely recommended. The game is fun, addicting and fast-paced - enough to keep yourself entertained. A really awesome game. 'Race The Sun' is one of the nichés in the game industry for sure.			"

												Smooth, fluid, intuitive first-person POV endless runner. Stark, barren landscape and vaguely Middle Eastern-flavored music give it a desert-at-sunset vibe, like Lawrence of Arabia on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rocket sled. Whip-quick turnaround at death coupled with a wide variety of challenges and map layouts to spatter with your burnt, twisted wreckage makes the game feel almost no-stakes. Smashing headlong into a wall and exploding has never been so relaxing.			"

												Great game.It's a very simple, fast-paced game that can cater to all skill levels.On the earlier sections, it isn't a difficult game. However, as you improve at the game (how much you improve can sometimes sneak up on you) you begin reaching the later areas, which can quickly descend into a chaotic mess which can be very difficult to traverse. The difficulty ramps up to you.Then you have the interesting mechanic of the sun. As the sun sets, the shadows grow, which makes the game more difficult as shadows slow you down, making the sun set faster. This is a mechanic I find fun and cool, as it gives you more incentive to try and keep the sun up and adds a little extra urgency.This game can really make you panic when you have a good run and the sun reaches the horizon. Which I feel is great.All-in-all, it's a great game that I recommend playing.			"

												After getting this game on friday i can honestly say that this is great. the game is challenging and intruiging and doesnt really get stale as you only have the same map for a day. the exploration is endless as you can just keep going in any direction (minding the obsticles). The one thing that my brother asked me is why is it only every day most procedual games are different each time but the fact that you have 24 hours to play means that you can compete on the leaderboards and it makes you feel better as its not so very random you can get good at a map. the game is very minimal in design and i think it would have been nice to have a sleeker ship but thats nit picking, games fun and as i got in on sale its great highly recomend and it improves scaning and looking skills as you have to be on edge to get far . a definate buy if you like reflex flying by the seat of your pants games that make you sound like your insane or simply need a small game to fill some bordom.

												It's hard to find reasons for this game not being awesome. Race The Sun provides a simple concept and goal for the player: dodge obstacles, stay out of the shadows, grab power-ups and score pickups. It's really that easy and therefore a very accessible game. Race The Sun's core mechanic, your vehicle being sun-powered, adds a unique factor of experience. Combine that with the insane speed at which you fly, and you'll have one exhilarating experience. Race The Sun is a perfect game for playing on a daily basis and due to level scrambling every day, the game greatly succeeds at variation. And then I haven't mentioned the very easy-to-use level editor yet. Too easy? Try apocalypse mode. This game just works in so many ways, and can really excite you on a daily basis. I therefore recommend this to everyone who likes a bit of fast-paced excitement with smooth graphics and strong mechanics.			"

												I have never seen a game that captures speed as well as this one does. Don't be put off by the graphics (although they are nice and have a good style) - this game feels fast, and has really high quality sound design. Not only does it feel fast, but heavy objects feel heavy - it is quite scary when a giant block rolls over right infront of you and a loud boom is heard and the whole screen shakes violently as you make a speedy escape. This is something you must buy.			"

Fricking ♥♥♥♥ing fisting god!EDIT: Well, now it does not crashes in the region 5, but it does whin I finally enter a world portal.

You can fit your craft to match your style, aim for bonus objectives, level up, gain new perks, and explore new worlds by going through portals littered throughout the runs that you go on.You will never get bored of the game.

												I played it a lot before I actually binded it to steam, I remember buying it on release.  I actually forgot I had it on steam, so the reviews a little belated.Now, if you're looking for graphically-intensive game, this is not your game, what this is however it a very fast-paced, relaxing, and nerve-wrecking game. Relaxing and nerve-wrecking? But how you may ask? Simple, while the gameplay and atmosphere is smooth, the tight controls and near-misses you will crave are addicting, the music is calm, but the impending doom holds a sense of mortality, it's a game like no other. If you wanted a comparison, then the closest I can think of is Burnout: Takedown 3, at the very least adrenaline is the same, while the graphic tend to reminescent of Star Fox.Be aware the game is pretty naked, there is no story, no plot, no real objectives, it is just you, the desolate island filled with obstacles and numerous contraptions, and your meager attempt at survival in this barren world, if the term melancholy resonates with you, this game just might be for you.

												Since the aesthetics and gameplay can be summed up rather handily in any of the videos above, I'll just comment on what you can't see: the controls. I'm hardly a video game savant so when I feel like a game is needlessly wasting my time with artifical difficulty, I'm out pretty quickly. Race the Sun however never feels like it's cheating; there's a clear weight and momentum to your movement that's easy to grasp, which means the blame for my many, many (many) premature deaths lie squarely on my own fossilized refelexes. Combined with a goal-based upgrade system and constantly changing maps, I regularly find myself picking it up and sinking in 10-15 minutes whenever I need a break from a bigger title. An easy reccomendation!			"

												I'll give it a thumbs up.  This is a simpler game, but I think that's what makes it good.  It does what it does well, giving you a small plane you have to charge across the landscape while avoiding obsticles and trying to go as far as you can before the sunlight runs out.  Some of the task might need some fine tuning, but it's something you can do a few runs on when you have half an hour and aren't someone that plays solitare.			"

												Relaxing, and fun to play. It is an endless runner where you play as a bird-ship-flying thingie, and as the name suggests you race the sun. Why? Well, you die when you run out of solar power, which is what the sun is eventrually gonna do if you don't kill yourself flying into the geomentry of the levelVERY fun, and VERY fast!EDIT: ONE ♥♥♥♥ING THING THOUGH. The stupid turn left/right only for # regions. HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THAT PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH.Especially because some regions have areas that you NEED to turn left/right if you go the wrong way, which is so easy because you can't TURN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEFT OR RIGHT TO DODGE THOSE AREAS, ARRRRGGGHHHOther than that, it's a fun game!

Notice: I got this game for free, so that may or may not bias my opinion. You have been warned.Race the sun is a sort of ""Surfing"" game in which you play as a solar powered aircraft (that doesn't have a slowdown function or landing gear, because video games) which is trying to keep itself from crashing by chasing the sun.This game goes easy on you at first, then they'll add gameplay components overtime, with pickups, equipment, and more.One draw to this game is that you can make your own levels, publish them, and play others' creations via the Steam Workshop.Likes: The gameplay is fast-paced, always keeping you on your toes. The style of the game is futuristic, minimal, and polygonal, all of which are popular. Full Gamepad support, along with simple controls, could let you play this game with a Atart 2600 Joystick. Seriously. This is an example of a successful Kickstarter campaign, showing that crowdfunding can work. Every day, the maps reset, making sure you don't play the exact same map everyday.Dislikes: ZER0 Multiplayer. (would've been great for couch gaming.) This game feels like something to be played on the go, so I'd suggest the mobile version. Too many attempts failed, and you could potentially rage quit. On the topic of User-created maps, Your Mileage May Vary.(seriously, this game is begging for a Star Fox skin.)			"

												I have to reccomend this game with an astounding amount of praise, in this game I found myself engrossed in the music and it started off slow, but then I started u8nlocking things, memorizing my world that was generated and learned new tricks, such as using pyramids to actually gain air in vital moments to jump blocks and gain enough height to avoid death on many occasions but what stood out to me the most was this progressive feeling of what felt like an artistic representation of man itself, it started out peaceful and with nothing but cubes and pyramids but then before I knew it, there were tunnels formed and then moving blocks then windmills and then full on structures that changed how I had to manuever differently then moving circles that seemed to move just to try to kill me, then bombs. Bombs that blinded me and acted as a wonderful but frustrating obstacles, all this time everything was getting faster and faster until I was sandwiched between two rows of cubes and then darkness, I was shifting in my seat and hoping my battery didn't die, then I saw a wall and nearly cried, 100K points in, next thing you know it lifted and I felt so relieved. This was all in a single sitting; I can't reccommend this game enough, especially because the portals add a new dynamic which put me into a cardgame from hell, dodging aces, spades, clubs and hearts. It was tense and marvelous as I was collecting points and taking in the hellish sight constantly asking what the ♥♥♥♥ was going on... I'm definitely going to play this game for much longer.			"

												This game is best played in first person with stereo headphones. I almost peed myself when I just barely avoided ramming a mountain because it felt like it was right in my face. I have poor depth perception, but this game makes me feel like I have excellent depth perception. Except when I crash in first person. SCARY AS HELL, especially when I'm in the groove. Though, gotta say some of the challenges would be better suited as achievements. One of my challenges right now is to only turn left for two rounds in one life. That is insanely hard, especially since there's areas where I absolutely need to turn right. Excellent idea for an achievement, but terrible for simply leveling up.9/10 game, just get it. STOP READING AND BUY THIS. It's simply fun.			"

You are a spacecraft that runs on sunlight, and you must collect certain items to keep up with the sun without getting lost in the dark or crashing into one of the many various obsticles. Additionally, in order to keep things interesting, the maps change every 24 hours, and there are various portals that will take you to new locations. Great soundtrack, tons of fun, and an overall interesting little indie runner game.			"

												The game has a very simple concept: you race the sun. The entire game is you travelling horizontally (primarily, you can use jump powerups for a vertical boost, but you never stop moving forwards) until either the sun goes down or you crash into something. Most of the time, you'll crash. The sun can be ""un-set"" with booster pickups, encountered as you move forward. But this just prolongs the inevitable. And I know I'm basically repeating the blurb but this is the entire game, quite simply. It's good, but I don't think it's worth £6.99 (or $9.99, I guess). Get it maybe when it's on sale, but I wouldn't buy it full price.			"

												And awesome high speed game where you take control of an odd plane thing and attempt to glide along this odd land, your plane is solar powered though, so you must collect powerups that cause the sun to go higher into the sky, but in return this makes obstacles come at you faster. This game originated on kongregate, the flash website, and have evolved into easily one of my all time favorite games. With decals, powerups, passive abilities, a workshop, and the infuriating apocolypse mode. And much much more i'd say this game, although slightly overpriced for its content is quite a nice game pick up when its on sale. It also has a ""zen"" mode DLC I plan on purchasing this mode when I can.			"

My games are over and done in three minutes.  The menu doesn't mess around and it loads quick so you can stay in the action.You're plane goes fast and you have to navigate an obstacle course.  Well actually it's more like a glider because it can't fly up.  You can take jumps though and that's fun.  The controls are responsive and liquid smooth.  Also it has a course editor too, so that's cool. Haven't tried it yet.I like this game.  It is simple but it works well.  It is fast and fun.			"

												I wasn't expect much from this game, but it's quite easy to get into the ""just one more go"" state. World changing every 24 hours is a neat mechanic as well.Not the kind of game you'd play for hours and hours on end, but for the odd hour here and there it's pretty good fun and oddly relaxing.			"

												Race The Sun is a rather minimalistic game about, well, racing the sun. With its daily generated maps and workshop content it is a really fun game for when you have some time to waste.It presents you with some choices to customize your 'ship', but it is not all too much - and some of the challenges you will be faced with might proove challenging.

												Great game, somewhat simular to Starfox 64, but far too unique to say they are the same.  Levels are frustrating, fair, and relaxing all at the same time.  The community map creator and workshop has a lot of potential and they simplistic design of the world makes it a lot of fun when making things. After completing all the goals in the game it became somewhat futile to try to get as far as possible since there was no little things that were there to keep you intrested. 8/10			"

												Lots of fun! It's an enjoyable challenge that has you jumping for joy at one point then swearing when you run into a mountain not two seconds later. Plus, the objectives and leveling system are actually worth your while! Since the rounds are short, it doesn't take up alot of time... I've played this at both school and work enough to say that it's great for passing time without making you commit to anything. Perfect for when on break or inbetween lessons.Even though it's single player, it's great to play with friends to see who can stay alive the longest. Definitely a game I recommend!			"

												This game is, in all it's  simplicity, a fun, and pretty addictive arcade dodge-race game.What's most exciting about it is that it will really test your skill over a period of time, because the further you progress, the harder the levels will get, and what keeps thisgame interesting? The official levels change in looks every 24 hours, so you won'tbe play the same levely everytime. The traps still remain recognizable.And you can make your own levels too, but as easy they make it sound, it isn't that easy to make levels in my opinion. Great game anyway! 8/10			"

												So, a racing game. Race The Sun (Flippfly﻿) has an interesting mechanic, whereby your solar-powered vehicle will slow down if it's in the shade, and you can only go so far—period—because the sun is setting. It uses a progression mechanic based on completing various objectives (collecting power-ups, getting your score multiplier to a particular level, making it through stages without any collisions, etc.), and since you have 3 different objectives available at any time, there's usually SOMETHING you can make progress on……until you can't, because you're terrible at racing games and your reflexes just can't make the cut (and by ""you're"", I really mean ""I'm""). I guess this is what I get for not playing any racing games since F-Zero﻿ on the SNES (1991) and Mario Kart 64﻿ on the N64 (1997).			"

Strange, as it has cards, but I don't look a gift horse in the mouth. :) As with all the games that drop cards, I at least look at it while it's running anyway to get the drops. Sailing around, trying to evade obstacles. [crash] Ok, try again. Sailed a bit longer. [crash] ... Smiling, and startled by every crash, I had fun and got the ""Just one more attampt!"" bug until I had other things to do.The map changes every day, which is very nice indeed (I can imagine it would get repetitive if it were ever the same level to start on).Definitely going to go back to this. Random side-note: I can't play actual first/third person perspective, I get dizzy-sick. Here it's just steering left and right, perhaps catching a jump of different kinds (as far as I've seen yet), but you still head straight for the sun. This actually works for me. Wheee!			"

												This game is best played in first person with stereo headphones. I almost peed myself when I just barely avoided ramming a mountain because it felt like it was right in my face. I have poor depth perception, but this game makes me feel like I have excellent depth perception. Except when I crash in first person. SCARY AS HELL, especially when I'm in the groove. Though, gotta say some of the challenges would be better suited as achievements. One of my challenges right now is to only turn left for two rounds in one life. That is insanely hard, especially since there's areas where I absolutely need to turn right. Excellent idea for an achievement, but terrible for simply leveling up.9/10 game, just get it.

It is about as basic as gaming gets, move left or right to avoid the blocks until you die and start all over again.But for some reason when it came out on PS4, I really got into the game and ended up ""finishing"" it by unlocking all the challenges.Does this mean the PS4 is just a better gaming platform than the PC? I'd have to conclude yes.That aside, race the sun is a decent little game that you'll get your fun out of. It isn't mind blowing stuff and you might be able to spend your time elsewhere on a deeper experience, but you could do worse.			"

												Ten dollars? Eh, I've seen less substantial things sell for a lot more. Still, I got it for five--- I suggest you do the same.Pricing aside, this game is excellent. Rudamentary on the surface, but extraordinarilly atmospheric. The musical score, while also simple, draws you into this little fantasy: you'll feel like you're in a different world while your brain tightens as you pass through every corridor, through every rolling block. The concept of the game is intriguing as you are literally chasing the setting sun, getting powerups to stay in the light that keeps your ship powered, breathing a legitimate sense of adventure into the experience.It's a great challenge game to play a few rounds with your friends and try to break each other's records.If you're into fast-moving arcadish games, throw this one on your wishlist and wait for a sale.

												This game has generally excellent controls and gameplay, but it could use a lot more content and some gameplay additions. I hope that it continues to get active development, because right now it is a fun but very sparse game with replayability that gets tedious after more than about 10 runs on the daily course.			"

												Playing Race the Sun is an experience in playing the pure essence of racing games, and it’s tremendously rewarding. The gameplay is simple, the graphics are minimalist (and beautiful, I might add, in their simplicity), and the controls are remarkably smooth.The developer also regularly changes the world you race in so it doesn’t become about just rote memorization, but you have enough time to figure out each world before it’s reset. There’s even an upgrade system which allows you to swap out accessories to change how you race – but even that is satisfyingly minimalist.And to top it all off, it’s integrated with Steam Workshop, allowing you to access hundreds of player-made maps for an even more unique experience.Everyone has those games they like to play when they just need a minute to relax or if they don’t have much time to devote to a game, and I’m happy to add Race the Sun to my list. At the same time, it’s robust enough to drawn you in for extended play sessions, with a relaxing cadence married to high-stakes urgency.It's a great little game.Full review.[www.thesewall.com] "

												First off, highly recommend listening to ""Chasing the Sun"" by The Wanted while playing this great game. Simply put this is a game where you pilot a solar powered plane and your chasing the sun to go as far as you can take it. Race The Sun is a simple and elegant game with beautiful background where you constantly forget your racing time to go places you never thought you could before. I recommend this game for all ages and all styles of players.			"

												Race The Sun is a game where every aspect of your experience will be pointing out to ""perfection"". It's difficult to describe my thoughts on it, and I also don't think it's necessary. This is a MUST OWN, it's really that simple. And then complexity comes, when you try to describe it. Let's start with the obvious.You have your solar powered craft, the setting sun in the background and obstacles in front of you. When you complete a set of obstacles, you arrive at a new region, which will certainly be far more cruel and unforgiving that the previous. You have a variety of power- ups, the yellow beacon thingy is the most important one, since, and this is where the ""race the sun"" part comes, the sun, as I said, is setting and your craft is solar powered. The yellow power- up will speed you up, prolonging your pathetic death, just long enough to see yourself plunge into an obstacle at an utterly insane speed, all because of your suddenly malfunctioning reflexes. But that's OK, you could always momrize the terrain and each obstacle, right? Nope. The people that made the game are actually so cool, that they are changing the game World every 24 hours. It may be similar to the World from yesterday, but it may be completely different. There is also a Portal World, which is also different every day. It may be a relaxing one, like, for example, observing a space battle. Or it may be one of those Portal Worlds that keep you on the edge of your seat, praying for a successful exit.They recently added a labyrinth mode, which is very fun to play and will really test your reflexes. The Sunrise DLC is absolutely worth buying.In conclusion, you have a perfect gameplay, a real challenge, amazing soundtrack, new World every 24 hours, Leaderboards, ship customization and a loss of words, upon witnessing perfection.

Works well with my pretty meh laptop and its entertaining and pretty easy to get into but impossible to beat. Challenging, repetative, artsy, and fun. I can't see myself playing this game for more than 30 minutes at a time but every time i do play, i enjoy myself, enough to come back to it. Definately worth a couple bucks to support! Repetative and can be somewhat tedious at points when traversing the first and second and third levels over and over again to get to more challenging things. However, the developers comatted this and mitigated that feeling by adding map changes. Every day the levels change, quite unique, and usine roguelike influences in an ingenious way. Thumbs up!!			"

												This is a beautifully unique and abstract take on a Temple Run style of games. Even though the soundtrack can be relaxing at times, you'll always be on the edge of your seat, doing everything you can to keep those last moments of light and life from slipping away before you fall to the bottom of the leaderboards. I HIGHLY recommend playing this game, but you will die. That is not a maybe, you WILL die. A LOT.Even though this is a wonderful game to look at and listen to, I wouldn't suggest playing it if you rage easily. It's not hard to lose your sense of depth perception and slip too far to the left, ultimately causing your ship to blow up. But it's not too hard to keep your hand steady and get yourself to the end of each reigon before recieving your reward. Even if you die, you're rewarded for playing. Multiple ship upgrades, level add-ons, etc. There's so much more to this game than meets-the-eye. Don't think so? Spend the measly $10 and find out yourself. It's an experience worth experiencing. ;3			"

												I just got this for free as a promotion and there's no reason not to install this. It has great music, aesthetic and humor. It's only a hundred MB or so and it's one of those essential games you have to fall back on when you're bored. Go ahead and buy it if you have extra money.			"

												So. I fell in love with the game forever ago but never got a chance to snag it until the free day, boy am I glad someone told me about it being free. I've wanted to play a ' Jet Slalom' type game that was actually decent for a while since I've played  one when I was little and this really hit the nail on the head. First of all, the slow start of the game was nice, the way the in-game goals progress and actually reward you slowly was wonderful. Every level or so you'd unlock something else, Tris, Jumpers, Boosters, Warps, and then the Shield/Escape warp, not quite in that order though. The challenges were imposing at first, but as you got used to how things controlled or got a new kind of power things got easier, like now I can consistently hit Region 6 no problem.  Another thing I most enjoyed was the fact that just when you start to relax and get into a groove (because up until region 8, things were kind of the same here and there. Go <left for more Tris instead of right> at so+so structure, even if the map is changed daily. I hit region 9 and suddenly had structures I had never seen before appear, every few regions is like that really.So many things in this game amaze me every time I boot it up, the little warp zones to go to other worlds (Created by players I suppose) and the extra game modes keep things refreshing and wonderful. The Sunrise DLC keeps things calming, the unlockable Apocalypse mode and Labyrinthia make the game even more challenging and new, especially the latter.My only complaints would be that you can't change to a different kind of vehicle for aesthetic reasons and the issue that rarely the Tri's won't pick up for you.10/10 would play again and die, then play and die again, and again.

												Like many, I aquired this game for free via a one-day sale.  However, now that I've played it a bit, I think it's worth the price.  It's actually been quite addictive, despite that fact that I'm not usually into this kind of game.The game is a simple one, so far with a whole 3 buttons to use lol.  You fly a fast moving aircraft along the ground, using the arrow keys to move left and right.  If you pick up a jump power-up, you can hit space to jump over an impending obstacle.  If anything hits your wings, you get bounced around and lose part of your point multiplier.  If you direct hit something, and this is usually what happens, you die.  You also die if you're in darkness too long, which usually happens at sunset.  Hitting boosters will reverse time, allowing you more time before the sun sets.  Ultimately, you will die.  A lot.The music and atmosphere make for a fantastic experience, and the game tends to make fun of the constant deaths.  It's expected that you will die, it's just a matter of how long.  There are always three objectives to complete, and finishing any of them will reward you with points towards leveling up.  Leveling up in turn awards anything from new power-ups, to upgrades to your aircraft, to things like new play mods and new decals.  Any objectives you finish are replaced with new ones, seemingly selected at random.  Some are easy, like collecting X number of points across any number of runs (which simply keeping trying will eventually earn).  Others can be brutal, like going several regions in a row while only turning left.  Ultimately, though, it keeps the game fresh for longer.Eventually, unless you are into high scores, the game will likely run out of anything for anyone to do.  The graphics, while rather atmospheric, are admittely simple polygons.  It is, after all, and indie game.  In the end, I'd say this is a decent game at a fair price.			"

												Got it for free. Would get it for $5.  And if your just passionate about these types of games, maybe you can justify the $10.   1 main track but extremely vastPlaying games from other user-created tracks of the workshop is effortlessMain track randomly changes every 24 hours for major replayablitiyFun to compete with friends (Online or Room)It's alot more fun that I thought it would be to say the least.
