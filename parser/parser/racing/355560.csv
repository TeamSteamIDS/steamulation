												Metal Slug lookalike with awesome techno music plus splendid cartoon artwork. A little short though, finish it in about 1 hour.			"

												First of all: This game seems to be a mobile port. There's a controls menu, but instead of telling you to press spacebar to jump and the left mouse button to shoot (which is everything you do in this game) it only tells you to touch.The game was fun in the beginning but it got repetetive really quickly. You aim, shoot, sometimes jump over a gap and that's it. Most enemies don't do anything besides flying towards the left-hand side of the screen and often you don't even have to shoot because they wouldn't hit you anyway, but of course you want some points. I never died because of the enemies, I only died because I fell down a gap while shooting at things for points.There are some really nice-looking bosses. But seriously, what's the point of them? They sometimes spawn a small enemy or shoot a cannonball at you - you can destory the cannonball with a single hit - and that's it. You can even disable the weapons by shooting at them. The bosses are easier than the rest of the game because they don't throw gaps and enemy swarms at you.I stopped during stage 4-2 because it was exactly the same thing as in 1-1, except for the multitude of gaps that made my keep dying. Oh, did I mention that minutes of shooting at small enemies isn't challenging or fun and that there are no checkpoints?Seriously, Trigger Runners has some great ideas and it can be fun for 30 minutes, but that's it.

												Not a bad game, but neither is good. An experience so simple (because it's meant to be played in movile devises) that really doesn't make an efford to stand out. Bland narrative, mediocre graphics, tedious bullet-sponge bosses. There isn't even a scoreboard implemented and the game dificulty levels feel the same, it really doesn't have replay value. In the other hand, the price tag is fair.			"

												Trigger Runners is a simplistic infinite runner game with a nice art style. It's an obvious mobile port because in the control menu it only tells you touch controls, not left mouse button to aim and shoot or spacebar to jump. The music and chimes are extremely annoying, thankfully there is a mute button. The game is fun for a bit, but quickly becomes repetitive and boring. There are boss fights at the end of each stage which should liven things up but they are way too easy. It's a mobile port that should remain on mobile. I got it a bundle, wouldn't buy it outright I'd go play it for free!			"

												Headphone users, beware.  Somewhere in the menu screen is an ear-splitting high-pitched chime that made me yank out my headphones.The game keeps track of your bullet precision and scores you accordingly.  In a shoot-em-up runner, I don't find this to be an enjoyable mechanic.  It creates a feeling of taking a test rather than enjoying a game.			"

												In Trigger Runners you are some sort of cowboy who feels like constantly running (or magically flying) to the right. You can shoot incoming enemies and mines that are in the way and you call also jump over obstacles and holes. You will almost always be on the left side of the screen (no moving on x-axis) except for one chapter of the games. Most bosses are interesting and fun that requires different strategies to defeat. The only complaint i can make for the game is the second to last level which has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t platforms in the end. It's beatable but really hard.			"

												this game is okits not good or bad but it lasted for just long enough to where I dont care very much.I only reccomend this game if you get it for cheap (like 20-30 cents) because its not bad but its short, repettive and really feels like a mobile game. "

												Short, simple, sweet, sentimental. These are the words I would use to sum up Trigger Runners. Done in a retro style, its music and graphics hearkening back to the games of yesteryear, it's a pleasant throwback compared to what we usually see. Gameplay is brief, only about thirty minutes, but it does strike me as reasonably replayable, obviously needed in this format. The story, told via cutscenes, is basic but endearing. The biggest flaw I see is that the jumps should take a heart away rather than automatically kill you, as they really seem to be the hardest opponents in the game. Besides that, the gun needs to have a broader angle - you should be able to shoot all around you. Shooting stuff just under you is impossible at present. The only other issue is a part where, with the ""barrier"" shooting on one level, the little bombs you couldn't blow up blocked your shots, making it nigh impossible to not get hit. It also needs a volume control on the options menu, as well as the ability to pause when a boss is loading.Does this have particularly engaging gameplay? No. Most bosses are very easy and lack defining traits. But it is a fun, quaint little game to just kick back with and enjoy. Retro, cheap, and has trading cards? I'll take it. Especially recommended if on sale.			"

												Trigger Runners is a marriage of endless runner and 2D shooter, presented well but ultimately a pretty average game that barely squeaks by with the addition of some ridiculously fun bosses. The sprite artwork is nice, but the artwork during the cutscenes is a little amateurish. The chiptune soundtrack is good. Gameplay, however, is mostly underwhelming: You run automatically through the level, jumping over chasms and aiming your gun to shoot the enemies before they can attack you. Jumping in this game is pretty wonky, so a significant part of the game's challenge lies in a couple of particularly tricky sections that require precise jumps that the game really doesn't let you perform. Trigger Runners' greatest shortcoming, though, is that it lacks a good balance of difficulty. Normal mode is really very easy, but Hard mode might well be too difficult to finish the game on, forcing you to decide between a course of gameplay that is either unsatisfying or frustrating.That said, the thing that really redeems this game, the aspect that saves it from mediocrity, is the boss battles. Boss design in Trigger Runners is incredible, requiring the player to juggle attacking the boss's main body to kill it with attacking the parts that will cause it to run you over or shoot back at you. The bosses in this game are just really, really fun to fight. That doesn't make all of the general ""meh""-ness go away, but it definitely makes it a safe recommendation, if only by a nose.			"
