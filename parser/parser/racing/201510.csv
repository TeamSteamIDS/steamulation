												The game name says Flatout. But do not think of it as Flatout. It is not even made by same developers as the original Flatout, Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage. This is made by Team 6. Team 6 has not made a single good game ever. And this is not exception.This game is absolutely horrible, I do not recommend it for anyone.The physics are one of the worst I have ever seen in racing game.Crashing does not feel good when it should in this type of game.The graphics look just ugly. Even the first Flatout from 2004 looks better than this in my opinion.There is not even a proper career mode, just a boring challenge mode that has random single races you can complete.This game is overpriced, it should cost 5€/5$ at max, and even then I would not recommend the game to anyone.Play the good old Flatout instead, or check out the Next Car Game by the developers of original Flatout games (Bugbear Entertainment). That will be a true demolition racing/derby game.DO NOT BUY FLATOUT 3			"

												Don't be stupid like me and don't buy this game, it's total garbage. If you want nice destruction derby game, get FlatOut2: Ultimate Carnage, soo much better than this crap. Or get Bugbear's new game called Next Car Game, thats a great destruction derby game (but still in making).The real problem with this game is, that it isn't made by Bugbear but by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company.Graphics seems (at least to me) like downgrade from FlatOut2.It have horrible original ""music"" and not licensed music from rock bands like the other flatouts.From what else i saw in that half hour i wasted on it was horrible maps like simple square with some houses around and thats it, thats your city race track. No destructible props at all.The ""throw your driver out of car"" minigames are worthless, so much better in FlatOut2.My verdict? It's 1/10. One point for cool name that can charm fans like me who played and loved previous FlatOut games.Seriously, don't buy this crap, hell, don't even pirate it, it's just waste of time.P.S. On the other hand, if you want to torture some clueless friend, get this game for him/her. He/She will get this monster big mindf*ck and will do anything for you, just not make him/her see this game again.			"

												This game is rubbish, if you loved flatout 2 or UC then don't buy. Flatout 3 features cars that have some of the worse systems of damage e.g. you trade paint and explode, you hit someone face on no damage. Maps that have the track missing in places e.g. a map where you have to jump across a black hole and never make it (including the AI). Zombies that should be road cones (they don't move). Graphics that are worse then flatout 1. Maps that have nothing in them called off road maps. This game was not made by bugbear it was made by Team 6. Think Pizza Dude and Taxi Raser.

												I was not able to complete even one hour game Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction. I at least when I bought the game expecting a Flatout 2 with slightly better graphics and either innovation in gameplay, it's true I did not expect much out of him, but what I saw is unbelievable.Cade the excitement of each race in Flatout 2? There is none of that here. This is a completely different game, where every minute in this game, seem hours. If you played Flatout 2, please DO NOT buy this game. Guarantee dissatisfaction.			"

												Flatout 3, or The One Where The Flatout Franchise ♥♥♥♥ Down It's LeggThe first two Flatout games were good fun, but it's third installment felt like a step backwards so big that I would have believed you if you  told me that it was released before the first game. The biggest issue with the game is one that writes the whole experience off: the physics are horrible. Cars don't FEEL right. Their acceleration, turning and collision feel simply horrible.

												Heyyo, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It's an insult to what Bugbear, the original developers of Flatout created. This was made by some ♥♥♥♥-budget-Russian ""game"" ""studio"" and it's every bit as bad as its Metacritic score of 23 / 100. The text is poor, it feels like a free game a college student made in a week, and it's nowhere near the price they're asking for. This game deserves to die.

												Awful in every sense of the word, ESPECIALLY when you compare it to its predecessors.But, before I begin, there's something you must know - The first two FlatOut games were made by Bugbear Entertainment, and they were phenominal racing games, especially FlatOut 2. This game? Totally different company that completely misunderstood everything Bugbear had done right. First things first, the AI is pitiful. I know the name of the game is destruction, literally, but it's a RACING game, and I'd rather have people using force to win the race than veering off the track in the first lap to wrestle in the grass like kittens.On this note, *everyone* targets you. I went into one demolition derby round, and it was hilariously stupid the way it worked. As soon as the countdown hit zero, the twenty-or-so other non-player racers veered to the opposite side like the Persian army and all ganged up on me at once, with the exception of, what, like, two motorists smashing each other's bumpers in. I mean, I played FlatOut 2's derby mode religiously, and it sometimes feels like the AI prioritizes you over their brethren, but even in it worst state it was nothing compared to this insanity.Now, it's time to compare it to its predecessors - Yes, Flatout 3 was made by a different company than the first two, but being a sequel by its title, I have to rate it in comparison to its past successes in the franchise.The other NPC's -- The way this development team tried to recreate Bugbear's non-player character gimmick is awful. If you haven't played FlatOut 2, lemme give you the jist of things - There were seven NPC's that were the only opponents in the game. They all had distinct driving styles, color schemes, and skills in different racing areas. They were so memorable thanks to this that you had those names ingrained into your brain after your first couple of races and figured out very quickly whose names to curse every time you launched out of your windshield.Well, 3 messes this all up. There are something near 15 characters, and some of them are so similar that you have no hope of remembering them. The character models are all very idealized, if you catch my drift, and there's one fully anonymous man wearing a motorcross helmet with practically full-balanced stats that you'll choose every time if you're sane. That's another thing, too - Unlike the original, where you were your own identity, you have to choose one of these punks.Anyway, 2.5/10, because it technically functions, I guess. Go buy Next Car Game instead, it's made by the same company that made the other FlatOut games. Speaking of which, go buy the other FlatOut games, too, they're super cheap and also on Steam. It's a shame those two don't have online multiplayer anymore, because if they did, I'd force you to buy them at gunpoint.			"

												Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. What went wrong? Gameplay has lost this ""catchy"" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place. Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. I like SPEED Mode it has something good :)The rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(To be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...			"

												I really loved Flatout 1, then Flatout 2 and Flatout Ultimate Carnage (although they were pretty much the same game, the latter graphically a bit tuned up and ""more to do""). So, since I bought the FO1/FO2/FOUC/FO3 package, why not play Flatout 3 although I've heard some pretty nasty stuff about it. Note: one of my Steam friends told me to keep my memory of Flatout as it was: when I did install, he uttered ""don't play FO3, uninstall and never look back"" Naturally, I rejected his advice, because I wanted to form an opinion that I made myself. How I wished I had listened. The game has graphics worse than Flatout 1, driveability worse than Flatout 1, a damage model worse than Sony's F1 2005-2009 (and that was horrible) and looks like a game made in....1998 at best. No, even the Half Life 1 graphics were better. 1996, 1997? For the Dutch in my list, it looks like A2 Racer. The first one.Just one race, but enough to scrape the pieces of my Flatout memory to what it was after Ultimate Carnage. Don't buy, and if you do, I hope you are buying the other 3 Flatouts with it, because this game should pay you to have you play it.			"

 Don't... A few years ago, I baught the FlatOut Complete Pack when it was on sale. when I tried to launch this game, it would never launch and I spent hours searching on the internet on how to fix it. I finally got it to work just so I could find out how terrible the game is (even not looking at it as a FlatOut game, its terrible) 10 minutes of gameplay and I asked myself, why did steam just throw in the #1 worst rated game on steam with 3 great racing games? And WHY does it cost more than the ones bugbear made?  I cannot reccomend this game unless you are looking for the #1 worst rated game currently on steam.  "

												I picked this up in a multi-pack with several other games as I had played previous games in the series before.  Honestly, I think I might have been better off paying more to buy the rest of the pack separately without this one. Avoid this game and here is why:The graphics are at best mediocre.  However, despite this expect to find the game stuttering and struggling to keep up (especially when turning corners).  This quickly becomes more than a minor annoyance when you find yourself losing control because the game has stuttered on a corner.  Textures applied to the walls around the track (such as graffiti on the concrete) will flicker.  (Keep in mind this is on a PC with an i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a GeForce GTX 670).The car handling is distinctly fishy.  Half the cars will stick to the road like glue.  The other half will be sliding all over the place.  There is nothing in between. The AI is even fishier.  When they go around corners expect to see carnage as they drive straight in to walls.  To make up for this the AI will quickly catch you on the straights – passing your car with no problems even when you’re burning nitro.  The damage modelling on the cars is all or nothing.  Where Flatout Ultimate Carnage slowly added damage to the cars depending on the impacts in this game your car is either brand new or has been completely crumpled.  There is no damage in between these two options.  As soon as your car scrapes against anything expect to see the whole car appear as if it has been squashed by an 18 Wheeler.			"

												Flatout was one of those games that I found on GOG and decided to try. I didn't expect much, but there was a sale, and I picked the game up for $1.90. The instant I got into a race I knew that the game would be good. There was mayhem, car bits smashing everywhere, tires all over the road, explosions after colliding with barrels. The game was fun, and to this day the original Flatout is one of my favorite racing games.So when I heard that there was going to be a Flatout 3 (Sequel to Flatout 2, which was also a great game,) I was excited. I waited the week until it came out, (I should've known something was up, they only announced the game a week before it was released!) and promptly bought the game off of Steam. Once it had finished downloading, I started the game up to see if it was a worthy successor to the game that I had loved.The first thing I did was check out the graphics options. I have a fairly fast computer, so I maxed everything out. I headed into a race. There were several classes of cars to choose from, and one of the classes was Classic. The car looked decent, so I chose it. After a loading screen with an unmoving bar, I was in. From the start, I was shocked. I won't tell you the specifics of this race, I'll just break it down by category:PhysicsOne of the best things about the previous Flatout games was the tight sense of physics. It wasn't quite a simulation, but it was realistic enough that you had to be careful not accidentally hit something solid and crash. It also had excellent car damage, and the cars dented and crunched realistically. With Flatout 3, all of this was thrown out of the window.Cars in Flatout 3 handle like they do in those racing games at the arcade. When you're driving them, you don't really have a sense of control like you do in a real car. They feel way too fast, and also very light. They are also very difficult to control. The cars in Flatout 3 have all of these traits. They just don't have the tight sense of control that previous games had. Instead, they feel like someone modded the game files to make things more hectic. Honestly, it just feels bad.GamemodesIf there was one thing that I thought Flatout 3 had going for it, it was it’s gamemodes. It has a varied lineup that looks like it could be fun to play, but still manages to fail. The modes are: Race, Stunt Man, Big Battle, Battle Arena, Monster Trucks, Speed, Nightshift, Offroad, and Challenge.Race is the obvious one. Race around a track, and the first to complete the predetermined number of laps wins. Nightshift is actually identical to race, the only difference being that all of the courses are at night. Race mode lacks depth, but this can be forgiven seeing as there’s only so much you can do with a lap race. Even so, the mode really isn’t very good. I wouldn’t say it’s bad as it is, it’s just kinda boring.Stunt Man is the classic minigame mode from the previous games. In it, you launch your driver through the windshield to accomplish various tasks. An example would be the high jump. You would drive down a long track until you reached a high net. You would hold down the nitro button to adjust the angle, then release to see how high your driver would be launched. It sounds horribly sadistic, but it really was quite fun in the previous Flatout games.Not so in Flatout 3.The reason for this is simple, and this is essentially the reason the game is so bad: The physics engine quite simply fails. You just can't launch your driver like you could in the previous games. It feels cheap, kinda like a bad iPhone game. The physics just don’t perform like they should in the situation. It ruins it.The next two modes are Big Battle and Battle Arena. In these modes, 8-24 cars are thrown into an arena. A car wins by destroying all other cars in the arena. This is essentially the Derby mode from the older games. This mode sounds fun when I describe it (and it was in the last two games), but it’s terrible in Flatout 3. The reason for this is (once again) the incredibly poor physics engine. Cars fly around as if they were made of paper. A car trading paint with you does 50% damage to you, whereas a T-bone collision only does 20%. And don’t even get me started on the explosions. Unfortunately, this gamemode feels like a cheap knockoff of the established mode from the other games.Monster Trucks is unique, and it is the highlight of the game. In this mode, your only cars are (guess what) monster trucks. You can then choose from five gamemodes. The first is Search and Destroy, which is a timed dash to destroy 40 barrels on the map. The second is Bring the Light, in which the goal is to bring 5 objects into a container. The next mode is Catch the Bus. In this mode, you have to knock over 5 double decker busses as fast as possible. The fourth is Royal Flush, where players roll a mine into the sewer. The final mode is Dude, Where’s My Car, which is similar to Search and destroy, only with car wrecks instead of barrels. These modes aren’t terrible to play like the other modes, and can actually be enjoyed. Unfortunately, this enjoyment is short lived, and it soon falls to the mundaneness of the rest of the game.Speed attempts to play like a F1 racer. All of the cars are Formula 1 cars, and the tracks are similarly themed. However, this simply doesn’t work. The combination between Flatout 3 and F1 2012 is a match made in hell, and the mode fails horribly.Offroad is kinda interesting: The goal is to get from Point A to Point B in as fast as possible. Playing the game reminds me of an old game called Fuel that I once had. The premise is interesting, but there’s so much junk everywhere on the track that its a nightmare to drive, especially with the physics engine that stubbornly refuses to go away.The final mode is challenge. This basically sets up specific scenarios in the previous gamemodes with goals you have to complete. This could be something like a time trial, or a race where your goal is to deal a certain amount of damage or wreck x number of cars. It fails to impress, just like everything else in this game.GraphicsSometimes graphics can warrant the purchase of a game. You may buy a game just to show off your computer, and that’s alright every once in awhile. This isn’t one of those games. The graphics are flatout terrible! (See what I did there!) The game just doesn’t look good. The cars always seem kind of squashed when you look at them, and they're low enough poly to be in a GameCube game. In fact, the entire game looks like a GameCube game. Here’s some examples to prove my point:If the GameCube one were higher resolution, it would beat out Flatout 3 easily.SoundEr, no. Just no. This game has terrible sound. The main theme gets old and repetitive. Cars sound like RC cars. Collisions have no force in them. And just about everything else sound really bad. It doesn’t help that this game has no soundtrack, which means you’re stuck listening to crappy music that someone wrote in a day. Words can’t describe just how bad it sounds. It really is pathetic.ConclusionIf you haven’t figured out by now, this game is terrible. Unfortunately for the studio that made this, the reason I feel it was so terrible was because of the Flatout label. Everyone who had played the original expected it to be the same. It just wasn’t. This game might have been decent it it wasn’t called Flatout 3, but because it was, it is terrible. There really wasn’t anything going for this game, and I’m truly sad to see how a previously excellent franchise fell flat.Graphics: 0/10Horribly dated graphics manage to look worse that Flatout 2.Sound 0/10Just no. Almost like they realized they needed sound a day before it was released.Controls: 3/10Racing games should not be played on the keyboard. When a controller was used, cars randomly careened out of control.Gameplay: 3/10Very little enjoyment in the game. "

												The worst incarnation of this series; this game was not developed by the original dev team of Flatout 1, Flatout 2, and Flatout: Ultimate carnage.While the previous titles sported a delicate balance of racing, wrecking, and arcade-like elements... this game throws it out the window and shares little in common with previous games aside from the genre of being a demolition-style racing game and it's title.Visually the game looks worse than it's predecessor. The two are not even comparable; It looks more like a game I would have expected to play on the originally PlayStation or maybe an arcade.Game-play-wise the cars have no real ""life"" to them, and again feel like something I would expect from an arcade game I pop $1 into. In previous iterations, cars felt like they had weight; you could slide beautifully around dirt corners, drift through tight turns, and could manipulate AI cars by using your force/speed/inertia. All that is gone in this game; even the most difficult looking turns are easily mastered by simply momentarily letting off the gas and simply hitting your left or right key; gone are the days of worrying about oversteer, understeer, or compensating for loss of traction. Even the ways cars bounce off each other seems more like you are in a pinball machine getting popped around by the bumpers --- you don't really have much control or force over other AI vehicles so you are at their mercy if their ""line"" gets in your way.Also gone are the days of customizing your car tuning. Probably one of my favorite parts of any racing sim or, for lack of a better term, any ""car game"" in general is the ability to swap X for Y and make your car, YOUR car. All the white knuckle driving done to take 1st pays off for that next much wanted upgrade. Not here ---- you pick from the standard layout of cars, and then you can pick from 2 or 3 different pre-defined ""tuning"" settings which invariably just give you more speed for less durability or vice versa. But in reality, it doesn't matter because EVERY CAR FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME.I'm not usually too harsh but I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for an arcade-style racing game I am sure there are many alternatives that would be better. If you are looking at this game because you've player previous FlatOut games, then skip it entirely as it is not the same development team and therefore not the same game at all. I've just installed ""DiRT Showdown"" and while it seems a little different than flatout, it has many of the same feelings and elements and a bit more up-to-date graphics. I have also heard that the original developers of FlatOut have been developing/developed already a new demolition racing game which I will be eager to check out, so maybe do a quick google if you would be interested in that!

												This game is a disgrace on proportions which are verbally unaccounted for. Don't even get this if you're a huge Flatout fan. Don't get it on sale. If someone gifts this game to you, delete it and just spare yourself the agony of defiling your memories of one of the most chaotically fun racing game series.It's an originally licensed Flatout ripoff, developed by a different team, trying to cashgrab with the brand name and doing an abysmal job at it.

												This game is freakin HORRIBLE!Its borderline unplayable! I mean you can play the game..... But I assure you, you will not enjoy your experience. Absolutly the worst controls I have ever had to try and use in a racing game.I luckly got this in a bundle for the other Flatout games which I hear are all really good. So I thouht I would try out the latest one first since it had steam achievements and had modern graphics. Well at least I have the other games of the series that are actually FUN to play. So ya... If you get this game, It had better be beacuse you bought the Flatout bundle like I did. And when you do pick up the bundle (for cheap) make sure to hide this game in you're steam library. Step 1: Find Flatout 3 in your Library under the ""Games"" tab.Step 2: Right click Flatout 3 and click ""set Categories"" from the list of options.Step 3: Click little box near the bottom left corner that says ""Hide this game in my library""& finallyStep 4: Have the  peace of mind knowing you hid an embarassing game from your steam library. And people that may look on your Steam profile will never know you had this garbage amongst your collection of ACTUAL games. :-)			"

This game is NOTHING like the originals, the car handling is dreadful, the graphics are awful and the gameplay has none of the originality and all out fun of its predecessors.

But this game is tough to get into, if not for the fact that the controls operate like your gamepad is begging for an immediate and swift death. The adrenaline of Ultimate Carnage is ill-supported here and the game lacks a lot of the punch that made past titles great.Worth noting - this game was made by a third party studio, not the one responsible for the earlier games.

Racing with a Broken AxleThis is one of the games on steam where a neutral option would prove useful.In its current state, I simply can't recommend this game, certainly not at $30. Maybe if you pick it up in a bundle for $3 or less, or a price tag of $5~10, but no more than this.I actually enjoyed the game, having played to completion the two Battle Arenas, but it fell short on Racing and Monster Trucks due to one fundamental problem - the handling of the various vehicles was just horrible at speed. It's recommended in the first race tips to master the handbreak, though this seemingly does very little on its own. Used in conjuction with the boost (or being slammed from behind), I was able to take corners, and finished the first race on fifth or sixth position, but the problem with that was the even further loss of control, often resulting in slamming into someones living room, least for the first race.Then there's the damage control system to contend with. I completely fail to understand how slamming into another vehicle at 160 kph head-on can deal only 1~3% of damage, while a slight ""scratch"" at half that speed can deal 5~15%+. I won, and lost, many a times for this during the Battle Arenas, even if did still technically win on points alone; which ""feel"" like for NPC's points are stopped been counted as soon as the player loses, instead of artifically continuing until the last one standing was revealed. Graphics wise, can't complain too much. There's a wide selection of vehicles, colours, and even characters behind the wheels, seldom ""repeated"" by the NPCs, if at all. So there's plenty of variance on the track. Though at no point did I actually see for example a wheel flying off, or a character being thrown out of the car when the car itself dies off, which can apparently be done in one of the other game modes where you land them in a target following a crash. A game from 1995, Destruction Derby 2, was based much the same as Flatout 3, and even for its time, if you took too much damage various parts of the vehicle would go flying; the wheels included, which then (was supposed too, but aided sometimes.) negatively affected your vehicle control, or you had the hood bouncing around obstructing your view until more damage knocked it flying off. These are relatively small things, but they matter to the overall experience.Long Story ShortPro's Wide Selection of Graphical Characters, Vehicles and Scenes Multiple game modes ranging from Racing to complete Destruction 'The Stig' reference with the unknown character Unlockable Characters & Vehicles AchievementsCon's Very poor vehicle handling, in certain instances a 1 star vehicle was easier to control than a 5 star. Poor damage control system. 'Scratching' doing considerbly more damage than head-on collisions. Damage control system based as a whole, rather than individual parts of the vehicle. Vehicle clipping. Occasionally at speed you'd drive straight through another vehicle, rather than hitting them (Maybe just me?) No, or little, ability to recharge your boost gauge. Tips say it recharges during jumps or causing damage, but it seems much more random than this. Damage having little to no affect on vehicle control. No losing of wheels until completely destroyed. Lack of varied sound effects; e.g horns, announcer discussions, crash sounds. Random unexplained ""flatout3.exe has stopped working..."" errors, or in some cases, inability to load the game at all according to some users. No Trading Cards ;)So once again, I cannot recommend this game in its current state, at the current price. If you can buy it in a bundle, then by all means. Otherwise, wait for a 80~95% sale, by which point it may be worth a couple of hours of entertainment, but overall, if the developers ever come back to this game, it does have its potential if cared for properly.

Stay the frack away from this title.The main reason why this game is so diffrent (and therefor worse then Flatout 1/2 and Ultimate Carnage) is because its diffrent developer for this game (Not Bugbear).

So, I've heard past reviews, I've seen videos of it, And I was convinced that this was a disgrace. So how did I end up with it? Because I bought the pack that came with it. I legit only wanted Flatout 1 & 2, and this thing tagged along with Ultimate Carnage (can't get that to work, but that's probably still way better than this). Because of that, I decided to try it. ""Maybe it isn't so bad,"" I thought to myself. ""Maybe it's just a letdown and that's why it's lower rated than Ride to Hell: Retribution.""Oh, I was wrong. So, SO wrong.So, after this thing eats 11GB of my hard drive (yes, 11 Gigabytes of valuable space), I hit play and brace myself. The loading screen pops up, the game loads, and I configure my controller. I choose a race, select my car and character, there's another loading screen, and the race starts.Now, here's my first of many problems with this game. The visuals.Why do all the cars look like the toy cars from that Burnout Paradise DLC? Excuse me, even worse than those?Not to mention the stage I was racing in was completely bland and uninteresting, with only right corners. Yes, only 90 degree turns in this stage. Even Flatout 1 had curved corners in it's first track. And yes, I know this was done by a different studio then Bugbear, the original creators, but still, have some variety in your stages to get the player interested (not like I was to begin with). Second of all, and by far the biggest complaint from everyone who's played this, the controls and physics. DEAR GOD.The car turned so stiff around the corners. It was literally the most unresponsive control in a racing game I've ever experienced. And the physics? Do you know how crazy and wacky the physics were in previous Flatout games? Well, there's little to no physics here. When the car hit the one ramp in the stage, it was like it was on a preset jump path. It only went up and down, it didn't even turn to the side. It was kinda like that jump in the original Ridge Racer. Except this isn't 1994 or on a Playstation 1, this game was released in 2011. Also, do you know what was one of Flatout's main selling points or what made it fun? The crashes and ragdoll physics. Here, you tap one wall going 30 miles per hour and explode. And there's no ragdoll cam. And it doesn't even look cool. Have any of the developers who made this even play or SEE a Flatout game before? Because it doesn't feel like it.And now for my last point which kinda ties into the physics point, the stunts. That's right, I actually played a different mode after the race. I tried something that I don't think anyone did before. I went one step further and tried a stunt event.So, after the stunt stage loads, I hit the accelerate button, press eject at the ramp and.... OH MY GOD WHAT?If you don't know (which you probably don't), you can pick different characters/ragdolls at the menu. I picked the first guy, who has a trenchcoat on. When I launched him during the stunt, it cut to a ragdoll camera for once. And, well....You know how sometimes games have that bug where a hair piece or piece of clothing stretch out in an odd way? Like into a wall or something? Well, my ragdoll's trenchcoat did that the first time. Then I retried the stunt, and it did it again. I actually think the developers gave up after the first stage of this game and never bug tested it. You hear that a lot with ♥♥♥♥♥♥, undeveloped games, but I truly thought that when I saw it. So.... in conclusion, don't buy this. Please don't buy this abysmal mess. Even if you got it with the pack, don't download it. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics, controls, physics, this game has it all. Did I mention that this takes up 11GB of space? I did, but did I also mention this game costs $30 normally? THIRTY DOLLARS? You can actually get Flatout 1 and 2 on sale, which are way WAY better than this for less. Even when this thing is on sale right now (at the time of posting this), you can still get the original 2 for less.I now know why everyone despises this game. Why it's the lowest rated game on Steam. And it's still up.Don't waste your time with this game. It took me longer to type this than play it, and this was a better experience than that.			"

												Wow, just... wow. I know people are saying this game is bad but you have no idea until you've played it. I honestly don't know what they're smoking to be charging £24.99 for this. It's just awful. You know a game is bad when half the recommended reviews are negative reviews. The graphics, especially on the cars themselves are terrible, even for 2011 and on top of that it runs like ♥♥♥♥ on Ultra and I couldn't stomach what I saw when I turned the graphics down a few notches. I don't even think it has a licensed soundtrack which is like, 70% of what makes any racing game good (for me, I'm well aware the percentage is a lot lower for most). They should erase this game from existence and call Ultimate Carnage FlatOut 3. Unless you buy this in a bundle with the others don't ever let this one near your library. You will get a headache like Michael Flatley was dancing on your face.			"

												Unlike most reviewers of this game, I don't actually like FlatOut all that much. I'm more lenient towards it now than in the past but it's still not my most cherished racing franchise by far. So when I looked upon all the vitriol of FlatOut 3, I figured I could at least give it a shot since people were complaining how bad it was and I being someone who isn't a big FlatOut fan could bring less skewed perspective to the table.NOOOOOOPE. This game is as much the car crash as everyone else has already said. FlatOut has problems but none to the degree of this pile.To start with, the controls are completely busted. In my opinion, you can't rag on a racing game's control right out of the box. You have to take time to understand the nuances of the way the game handles before you can write it off. One of my biggest problems with FlatOut is its handling, which has a very loose and bouncy feel to it that makes it hard to predict what will happen. While troublesome, at least you could make the car do what you wanted if you were patient and meticulous with the controls. That doesn't apply here. Any driving finesse you could hope for is blown out the window thanks to cars that drift like they're on glass. Using the handbrake is an even bigger crapshoot because it spins your car 90 degrees and redirects all the momentum in the direction of the turn, which is completely awkward. In addition, the crappy controls make racing a chore because you can never seem to get a good amount of distance, having to struggle with the terrible controls more than race.The graphics are bland (like an early Xbox 360 game) and the camera has a weird fish-eye perspective, especially when you kick in the boost, that doesn't feel natural. I get what they were going for but it would have been better just to leave it out. One fresh innovation over previous FlatOut games is the ""Ultimate Move"", which occurs when you fill up a secondary bar. When maxed, you hit the button and time slows down as well as makes your car invincible, being able to plow other cars off the track with only the slightest bump. Neat, but hardly something that makes the awful racing worthwhile. Beyond that FlatOut's signature ""plow into roadside junk and earn boost"" mechanic is still present, which is something I never really cared for in the first place (since, combined with iffy physics, you end up doing yourself a mischief while trying to energize your boost meter by hitting objects the wrong way).One thing FlatOut has gotten right for me in the past is having a pretty good licensed soundtrack. This game has none. The menu music is just generic and, baffingly, there's no music at all when you race. Why? Part of a good racing game is having fitting music pumping in the background as you speed along. Having NOTHING is dumb as rocks.Anyway, I didn't get very far because this game is such a junk heap. This is definitely one of the worst racing games I've played, even as someone who thinks FlatOut leaves a fair bit to be desired. I only played this because of the upcoming FlatOut 4: Total Insanity and, frankly, I wish I skipped it.			"

												Let me give you the TL;DR right now. Worst game ever.I played a single race (yes I made it that far, so I earned the right to judge the game). I immediately remembered a really funny parody of the FPS games of that era. Duty Calls. Now for those who aren't familiar with this name, let me describe it briefly. Duty Calls is a parody of many FPS games, based on Call of Duty franchise. It was made as an advertisement for Bulletstorm, whose trailer played at the end of this mocking game, with the message being ""nowadays FPS are like the one you just played, here is what it is supposed to be like (Bulletstorm trailer begins)"". Flatout 3 felt exactly like that. ""Here is a crappy racing game to depict everything wrong with racing games today, and now, real Flatout 3 begins where you get to have super fun just like you had in the previous games, even ultimate carnage, which was basically flatout 2 re-sold to you suckers, but turned out to be pretty good anyway"". Disappointment begins... It was no joke, no ""real"" Flatout 3 started. Flatout 3 really is the horrible.... ummm..... I can't really say that it's a game.... It's...... a software...... where you control...... no not control........ more like........ watch a car that was based on the drawings of a drunk newborn...... cruise in a city designed by a band of autistic apes...... and think that you contribute to its behaviour by pressing certain buttons on the controller.Ok jokes aside. Graphics are extremely unfinished. Simple and undetailed, but not intentionally, just due to lack of skill and/or effort. Just look at the screenshots. At the first glance they look pretty decent. Now look closer. Inspect details. Don't tell me it's a 2011 game. Compare it to DiRT or just Flatout UC. You will see it has horrible graphics.Controls just don't matter. You don't feel in control of the vehicle, not even a little bit. The car just goes vroom vroom. No realism, no control, no fun. For those who will bash me for looking for realism, just go play the previous games. You will see what I mean. Junker cars used to slide, drift, bump, etc. Now they just perfectly hover over the asphalt. When you try to turn, it either doesn't turn enough (if you're too fast), or turns successfully (if you're slow enough). It doesn't drift, slide unless you pull the handbrake. But if you use nitro when your car is aligned with the road, it just immediately and magically stops sliding and continues it's hovering over the road. Here is a short list of games that offer a better and more realistic driving experience: Asphalt 8 (iOS and Android), The Need for Speed (1994), FIFA '96. Also, I'm using a Logitech F710. When I set the controls to the gamepad, it stops working. If I set them to keyboard I can use my gamepad with xinput mode. ♥♥♥♥ logic!Sounds. There are 4 sounds in total. One of them is the menu sound ""click"". Three in game sounds are ""vroom"", ""bfffttt"", and ""dufff"". Now ""vroom"" is the engine sound made by the cars engines. The sound was produced by a pair of bored game devs, that just made the sound with their mouth. I can almost hear one of them saying ""screw the consumers, they will buy our games anyway"", in the middle of the sound recording session, faintly hidden behind the sound of the engine. ""bfffttt"" is the sound nitrous makes, and the artistic creation of this amazing sound was most likely based on an air refresher spray. ""dufff"" is the collision sound used in every single collision to every single combination of objects. Again, it was probably made by devs dropping a heavy pillow from a distance. Music. Literally non-existent.Car tuning. Do you remember the simple, yet fun car modification system Flatout used to offer? It's gone. Here is the new system. ""Would you like to tune the car?"" [Yes/No]. If you choose yes, then the car is ""tuned"" by standards seen fit by the devs. I swear to god, I am laughing at the stupidity of this, as I'm writing, while crying on the inside because it isn't even slightly exaggerated. Ladies and gentlemen, a new era of modification begins where cars are either ""tuned"" or ""aren't"".Please just watch a single gameplay footage from any source. Even the official game trailers give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is. Don't take any of my word for it. Just look it up on youtube yourself. Watch some videos and see for yourself that every single sentence you read here, is describing that video.I bought the Complete pack for 10$. I am not sorry because I love Flatout games. I played them on PS2 for long hours. I am glad to have 1, 2 and UC in my steam library for just 10$. But if you want a Flatout game, just buy UC. 2 was better than 1, even though 1 was a pretty solid game itself. And UC is just a graphically and realistically superior game, that is essentially Flatout 2 with additional content.			"

												Racing games are easy to make.  You put some cars on a track, make them drive around in a circle, and award the ""win"" to the guy who completes the track.  That's how almost every racing game works it's a simple formula. You start at easy races, and then as your player gets ""skills"" you continue to make the races harder, until he is racing almost perfect lines Flatout 3: Chaos and Destruction doesn't seem to agree with this.  It gives the player options of modes to play.  There's a lot of variety here, that would be a good thing.  The problem is the difficulty of this game is extreme.  There's no tutorial, and the game just is very hard.  If you turn the difficulty and number of cars down, the game is better, but still quite difficult.   There's no tutorials, which means there's no explanation of the boost system (it seem it awards boost for style points when near other cars, maybe?) and the AI is INCREDIBLY difficult.  If you don't race near perfect on Easy, you'll lose.  Even when racing perfect, you better be boosting.  At medium, you don't have a shot, you probably need perfect boosts, and even then there's no rubber banding if someone gets ahead so expect to lose often. The game has the following modes. Race, (standard difficult race) Challenge mode (Seems like race, couldn't beat the first challenge) Splatout! (Kill zombies, race around the track for points) OffroadNightShift (night driving?)Speed (Faster cars, easier to crash)MonsterTrucksBattle Arena (fight) Big Battle (Bigger fight) Stuntman (a variety of annoyingly hard challenges) All of those would be amazing if done competently, but I would say none are properly executed on.  Sad because I love racing games, and high adrenaline games are fun, but this does everything except get the blood pumping. A shame but this is a very firm ""Do not recommend""  If you like Racing, Dirt 3 is good, if you like carnage, Burnout Paradise is bar none the best.  If you like killing ""Zombies"" go play Carmageddon.  But what ever you do, don't even boot up this game.   It's not worth it.			"

												This game would be an alright game if it didnt have the flatout name. Its actually kinda fun, just get used to the framerate. Nothing above 60 for me. On very very low settings. (AMD quadcore 2.2GHz cpu and AMD Radeon R5 1gb. Not the best, but i should be able to run it better.) You get to unlock tracks and race in unique cars. I had fun playing this for the first time, but i cannot recomend it.Pros:-unlocking tracks if fun-racing is satisfying-unique cars and gamemodes (i.e. you can kill zombies, drive monstertrucks, ect.)Cons:-terrible framerate-poorly optimized-doesnt feel like flatout-physics are TERRIBLE-ai isnt great-graphics arent that good for the fps-feels like the devs focused on making more characters, which have no effect on your racing, than real contentGraphics: 4/10Gameplay:6/10ai:5/10satisfaction:7/10overall: 5/10GET IT ON SALE IF AT ALL			"

												Not the worst driving game ever, but if you loved the hell out of FlatOut 2 and/or FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, then this release by a different developer will be a big disappointment. Still, it's not all that terrible, really, if you're not familiar with the older games (but they did make good effort to address issues). I would still recommend FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage instead (or FlatOut 2 for older computers); and/or if feeling adventurous, the next-gen early access Next Car Game from the ex-FlatOut devs. [Other great similar ones: Burnout Paradise, DiRT Showdown]			"

												This is a FlatOut game in name only. It shares none of the good qualities the previous games had. The first sign I knew that this wouldn't be a quality title was the developer: Team6. If you know anything about the FlatOut series of games, you'd know that all of them were developed by BugBear Interactive. Still, I was stupid and went ahead with the purchase (only $7.49, but still, I could have bought a better game). Expecting something at least halfway decent, I got a buggy, crashing, and barely playable pile of mess dumped upon me. The physics are arguably the absolute worst thing about this game. Cars don't handle like cars, they handle like ice cubes lubed up in a messy bowl of KY His and Her jelly and butter. The graphics are just awful and look worse than the first FlatOut game, which, for reference, was released in 2004, a wopping 7 years before this pile of fail. I guess the only nice things I can say about it are the car designs themselves, the amount of them, and the amount of  game modes included in the game. Other than that, avoid this like the plague. If I could get my money back, I would. Rating: 1/10.Buy the other FlatOut games and BugBear's Next Car Game instead.			"

												This game is horrible, it is not the flatout we know and love (if you are a fan). I was a fan of all of the previous flatout games, but this is trash with my reasons for calling this below. 1. The physics of the car feels like you're driving on ice, and the cars don't respond as expected at all.2.The menu system is horrible.3.It looks like they picked random models online and gave them names and a random bio.4.The game is no-longer made by bugbear interactive, this is probably why its completely different. Its still published by the same company however.5.This game doesn't feel like a member of the flatout series at all, i wish they would have released it as something else.Things they got right?:1. Integrated music player, its nice having your own music.I really wanted to like this and i was genuinely excited to see it appear, but now i'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off one of my favorite racing game series has been ruined completely.Stick to flatout 1 & 2!!!

												Don't buy it. I really mean it. If you like the FlatOut Series, stick with Ultimate Carnage, which is the last before this here. FlatOut 3 is not beautiful, its AI is the worst I've ever seen in a racing game... They completely torn Ultimate Carnage out and excluded every single good part of it and even making it worse after that.If someday it costs 10 bucks, don't buy it. If it's five bucks, don't buy it too. Don't even download a pirate copy of it 'cos it won't worth your time. In fact, use the same strategy which you'd use with Duke Nukem Forever: do not have it in your wishlist and say it in every social network that you will refuse this game as a gift as well.			"

												I love the Flatout series..I really do love it! And I heard from alot of sources that Flatout 3 is like the unwanted child of the series. But I couldn't believe it..I looked at so many reviews and tbh I thought that the gameplay doesn't even look that bad. So I tried it just now..I never ever regretted playing a game that much.This series was once known for it's incredible driving physics and its fun races including a partly destructable circuit..well forget about that in Flatout 3: Normally you would slow down when you aren't driving on the track but offroad..well here the speed is always the same and therefore nobody drives on the track. The car flips after every single ♥♥♥♥ and the environment is non destructable. If you ram a stone then you have to respawn. Also respawning makes you stand still for a few seconds which is a huge disadvantage. There is no career mode and you have all the cars from the very beginning which sucks. There are a lot of modes, but they are either other car models or the challenge mode, where you have to complete 50 random challenges. Also the 'Stuntman' Mode is back, but because of the poor physics it is no fun. The handling is so bad that it doesn't matter if you take a car with good handling and bad speed or bad handling and good speed, because the handling is exactly the same..utter bull****. The Graphics are slightly better than Flatout 2 but because of the overused motion blur it looks stupid. And the best feature: If you finish below 1st in any race you automatically lose and have to start over the same ♥♥♥♥ again..DON'T BUY THIS JOKE OF A GAME FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!			"

Graphics are worse than in Flatout 2, but it lags as hell, even though my pc runs Crysis 2 on high settings without any problem. Music is worse, physics and camera are much worse, interface feels very uncomfortable. The only good thing about it is that it doesn't have GFWL support, when the UC did. Overall it is a really, really bad game. It wouldn't be such a big deal for me, if it wasn't a sequel to flatout games, but, unfortunately, it is and it makes it the worst game i have played in a last few years.			"

												Do NOT buy this game, it might say Flatout in the name, but it was not made my the same developer. Not that a different developer could do a good job, but in this case it is horrible. I bought this game back when it was new, because I blindly assumed I would be getting Flatout 3, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade racer made by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys. Buy all the other Flatout games, 1 & 2 they will give you entertainment.

												I don't uusally trust  Metacritic but this time the score for this game is right, FlatOut 3 was a complete mistake, I have no clue how this can even be called flatout, I have played bad generic racing games in the past but this takes the cake. It actually does have a lot of game modes but with bad gameplay like this they're basically worthless, avoid this game, if it's even called that.			"

												Don't ever think of getting this, no matter how cheap. I'm a fan of FlatOut and FlatOut 2 and didn't even finish the first race in this.It's bizarrely bad, the kind of bad that makes you pause in awe of its epic, sweeping suckitude and instills you with the immediate urge to warn other people lest their lives too will be tainted. There is no point in getting into details about the different aspects of this game. Just assume it's worse than any racing game you have ever played in every aspect.I'm not exaggerating. Don't be like me. It's not too late for you. You can still save yourself.Don't get FlatOut. It doesn't run on modern machines. Don't get FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. It's Windows Live. Get FlatOut 2 and wait for Next Car Game.			"

												Maby I was expecting too much. What I wanted from this game was something like Flatout 2, with that fun, cartoony art style and derby/racing game. First off, this game has aggonizingly slow load times and I run this game on a fairly modern computer! The soundtrack is so dark and mysterious which doesn't help with that fun part either. I also dislike how if you looked at Flatout 2 and Flatout 3, you would not see anything that represents each other. Set aside the bad stuff, I do like how this game looks, it looks absolutely goregous and I have to say I wasn't expecting Flatout 3 to be looking this good. I also like how you can finally choose your character which was something that was highly requested throughout the Flatout franchise. I also like how there is a whole new selection of cars to choose from. I don't like how there is no car from any of the previous Flatout games in Flatout 3. The number one thing that really bugs me the most, is the physics of this game, they are NOTHING like any other Flatout games, same with the camera angles. I won't get too much into detail with that because I have so much to rant on about with the camera angles and physics. I will probably play this game again being me who doesn't want to accept the fact that one of his most beloved franchises is now ruined by one simple game. I'd give it a 5/10.			"

												When you have played the FlatOut series for years... YEARS on end, I remember playing it on the Playstation 2 when I didn't have the game on PC yet at my friends house, it was sooo fun. Then I had a new PC and I could play UC and I played it for DAAAAYS on end.And then something like this, in your favorite franchise, comes along. Team 6, you should be ashamed of yourself. It looks like they took the previous titles in the franchise, threw it out the window, went outside and stepped a few times on the box cases, all smuddered in the dirt, spit on it and said 'let's squeeze the ♥♥♥♥ out of the FlatOut fans'.That's exactly what happened. An absolute travesty. It should be eradicated, considered non-canon and remade and rereleased by a competent team that knows something about racing games, and especially about the FlatOut charm.

												Take Carmageddon, take out the gore, the good gameplay, and add some new cars to it, upgrade the graphics to Worse-Than-FlatOut 2 tier, mix it with horrible performance and put it in the oven for 25 minutes at 200°C.Wonderful, you've got FlatOut 3! Except it's not wonderful. In fact, throw it in the trash and think about what you just did.This game is the downfall of the FlatOut franchise. Not only because it was made by a game dev studio that usually does Wii games. No, this game also lacks of pretty much everything that made FlatOut fun. Realistic damage models, good driving physics, nice visuals, funny minigames, multiplayer fun. This game has nothing of those. In fact, it is probably the purchase I regret the most. Not only because the game is not worth the money, but also because you get nothing for your money. All your good expectations are shattered in the very first race. The driving feels awful, the physics are horrible and don't get me started on the damage model. You'd expect a game that looks like this to run smoothly, but it doesn't.I don't even know if I want to go trough the pain of writing a full review here, but there's not much to say than DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU EXPECT THE FLATOUT EXPERIENCE.Please support the real FlatOut 3 instead, Bugbears ""Next Car Game"" which you may find in the recommendations above.

												I once started playing Flatout (1) as a demo.This was car racing the way I like it! The stunt modes were fun, but not a part I find necessary in this game. It was the arcade style of driving, not too difficult for anyone. It was the focus on damage, so you could earn money for new cars even by driving the wrong way! The upgrading system is a bit RPG-ish and keeps you going for more. I have bought all Flatout games since then. Flatout 2? Better. Flatout, Ultimate Carnage? Better again. I still play it every now and then, it's still parked on my HD. Just because it's fun without restrictions.So, everyone considering buying Flatout 3: DON'T DO IT!! Go for the old one's instead, preferably Ultimate Carnage. Flatout 3 is everything the earlier games aren't. It's from a different developer and they managed to mess up everything that gave Flatout it's distinct quality. Racing arcade style is no fun anymore, there is hardly a damage model. It's aWASTE OF MONEY!Keep an eye on Bugbear, they still exist. I do not pray, but for a good follow-up of the old Flatout games? I am on my knees..			"

												DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was under the impression that Steam retailed reputable games, to later find out that this is total garbage, I have owned this game for a long time and have only been able to play it for a few hours, I can understand the lack of support because there are no micro purchases in the game for steam to make extra money off, I personally believe that steam should show some integrity and dignity by refunding or compensating the people that bought this game and were dissatisfied with the end product, Steam Credit would be acceptible,The Fact that steam would sell such an inferior product goes to show a lack of integrity and poor customer support to the people who, at the end of the day, support them.Be wise with your purchases people, just as with many retail/sales people/companies, they will promise you and tell you everythin you want  to hear, but as soon as the transaction is done, any misleading information, inferior quality product will be left in your hands and you will be told that it was your fault for not researching the quality of the game or services.If this was an automobile, It's a LEMON and just like car dealers, Steam does not care as soon as you drive off the car lot, they got their $$$$$ why should they care about you anymore?

												After playing the new one only for about an hour, I tend to say that every other Flatout part is more fun when it comes to the mini-games. I will keep you up-to-date, when I have digged a bit more into it.But you can't go any wrong with Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage. (Only Flatout 1 and 2 are moddable!)			"

												Do I like this game? YesDo I think it deserves the name Flatout in its title? NoThis game is great and all, but it seems like it was rushed in a few areas.  The game is good, but not Flatout good.  I'm pretty sure if this game was on Steam under a different name, it would be widely accepted throughout the community.  But when I'm playing this game, it doesn't feel like a ""Flatout"" game to me.  Flatout 2 and Flatout UC were the best successor's to Flatout.  This game in my eyes is not a Flatout game, but it's still a good game.  I got it in the Flatout Complete Pack when it was on sale.  This game is only worth it however if you buy the pack during a sale.  $30 for this?  No way.  But $6 is a steal.			"

												This game has issues-true, but it doesn't deserve to be at such low rating, so giving it a thumbs up. I take most negativity falls from the expectations people had, not for the game itself. So what is nice. I've enjoyed formula racing, offroad racing, destruction derby racing and zombie smashing. The visuals are not bad as well. I don't remember music but it was ok I guess but worse then Flatout 2. I haven't experienced any crashes or visible glitches. The stunt mode looks worse, and the worst thing is street racing, the driving model for this one is indeed ugly. Upgrades seems to be marginal, but at least there is some varsity in cars that can be chosen from.I had some nice time with this title (playing mostly in offline mode), so I believe others can have such too, just don't expect from this title to have anything to do with real Flatout series. Of course 30 Euro for this game is way to much, but fortunately this games lands on really large discounts during sales and is visiting bundles.			"

												This game gets so much hate. Yea, it's not the best of the Flatout series, but so what? It's still a fun fast-paced arcade racer. The controls aren't perfect, the music isn't has good has 2, and the graphics are somewhat ugly, but that doesn't take away that it's fun to play once in a while. Using a keyboard for controls is an absolute nightmare, but then again (IMO) using a keyboard for any racer is a bad idea. Use an Xbox360 controller or you'll have zero chance. I only played a little bit of it, but the little bit I did was fun. At least to me. I don't play many racers and really only truly enjoyed Forza 3 on 360, but this was good to me. I find the entire series fun. It's like burnout or NCG. Stop your whining that it's different. Isn't that how developers learn what to do about games?			"

												Ok, I was honestly expecting that the latest release of Flatout will be the best so far. I have never been so wrong in my entire life and yet they got the name right: ""chaos&destructrion"" which fits perfectly to my hopes and dreams about this game. But here it goes, allow me to start with the good parts of this ""masterpiece"":+it has steamworks+it has achievements+it has multiplayer and works well with the steam incorporation+it gives you a good reason to appreciate the classics and your life in general+it has wacky looking characters and vehicles, always good for a good laugh (since this entire game is a laughing matter)And now...for the long and tedious negative list...I could probably just sum it up to: ""It sucks!"", but I will mention just a few of the downgrades (in comparison to it's predecessor it seems lesser of a game) and downfalls of the game:-it crashes, sudden unavoidable and uncontrollable exit of the game (I have everything up to date, but not only for me, but also for others...it just gives an error and crashes)-bad handling (not sure if this game was supposed to have handling that you would only see in those old car games, really rudimentary and quite disappointing)-bad graphics (I know I played it on low, but I wasn't expecting to look worse than the first title)-no community (hmm, I wonder why? *sarcasm* )-the crashing effects suck (apparently every time you crash, you lose all of your wheels and other unaesthetic looks for the crashing events)-from what I noticed, it lacks the story part or something related-the physics are broken most of the time-limited maps, barely new features compared with the previous titles etc.-it was not worth the price I paid at the timeAnd the list can easily continue for a lot...this is my experience from only an hour or so of gameplay...but, I will still recommend this game, because it really helps you to learn to appreciate what you have and, heck, how knows, you just might enjoy this game while you are drunk or feel like doing something really dumb, so why not keep it close for just those special occasions when you ""dare to be stupid"". This game really deserves it's metacritic score 2/10 .			"

												Not as good as Flatout 2 but I still enjoyed this game.I don't know what these peoples issues are. I've used this game on multiple PC's and it's never had any issues.It was working fine on PC's without the best parts either. No lag on a GT 9800 with a AMD Athlon II 2.91 GHz dual core, 4GB DDR2.The controls are no worse than other games. Burnout Paradise, Need for Speed.. There's not much difference. I mean, you can re-map them if you hate them, so.. what's the issue?I tell you to take the fact this game is 12% overwhelmingly negative with a pile of salt. Buy the game, try it, if it works, enjoy it. Don't just take confirmation bias to your head and hate it just to hate it.This is a good game made by a good company.			"

												This game isn`t really a Flatout game i must admit. But it`s not bad! There came a few patches and its a really good arcade racer now. It has many cars and maps to drive and unlock and there are many modes like stuntman, races, party modes like monstertruck and a zombie mode. Technically it works fine for me on very high settings (GTX 660). It has not as good graphics as Flatout Ultimate Carnage but its ok. It did crash sometimes for me but that stopped in the last time.The AI seems to be stupid but that really hurts mostly in Destruction Derbys. In Destruction Derbys all AI drivers `hunt` the player. That`s annoying. So the massive 24 player destruction derbys are good for multiplayer but there`s no one online.In total Flatout 3 is a good arcade racer that doesn`t need good skills so it`s perfect for playing once or twice a week. 30 $ is too much for this game so get it on a sale.

												Baddest game in Flatout series, I could say that plan of the game was perfect... all those ideas with zombiemode, monster trucks, offroading etc... but handling was worst , and in game graphics was just looking like in some cartoonish racing games. Offorading, Monster trucks and Speed racing was fun... but racing itself at ""Race"" was just impossible... really... But there is just few good things too... Choosing characters including beautiful women, Lot of vehicles and their even looking cool at menu, but not in game, and ofcourse easy steam achievements... thats why i am playing it, i am achievementer. Also fun was offroading and monster truck missions, but there was just only few of them. I Would respect this game, if it would use Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage game engine with nice handling etc, but as it is right now... its just not worth... atleast not worth this price. Thank god i got it as extra for FlatOut Complete. It just should not own ""FlatOut"" name.			"

												 If you like offbeat car racing games,  Flatout 3 is a game worth buying. It has  9 modes that  include  all of the  old  modes such as stuntman and demolition derby,  There’s also Monster Trucks, Speed Racing, Off Road,  one called Night Shift where you race at night  and another that has 50 different challenges. Many more than previous titles in the series.That said, I was really disappointed with the graphics and   vehicle handling.  Graphics seem to have taken a retrograde step and handling is much more difficult in Flatout 3.   Overall I don’t regret purchasing this title, but it’s not what I expected.  If you are familiar with the previous Flatout titles   you’ll see what I mean.  Bugbear Entertainment  disappeared back in 2007 so  a new developer has  created this new title and probably explains the differences.

bad FlatOut game. fun game when running properlyDid you like FlatOut2 destruction derby, but wished the levels were bigger?Did you like FlatOut2 destruction derby, but wished you could go against 23 other cars?Did you like the crazy mini-games in FO2, but wanted more?If you said YES to any of these, then you will probably enjoy FO3 enough to appreciate it for what it is: an arcadey racing/car combat game in the form of a bunch of mini-games.PROSmany vehicles & driver models  -makes me feel like I'm playing a poor-man's Twisted Metalunlockable vehicles, modes, & maps make it more addictive  -I wish I could tell you my favorite vehicle, but that would SPOIL itMultiplayer (for up to 16 players).Single Player offers good # of game settings to change to your liking (# of AI cars, game speed, & difficulty)bigger, interesting levels  -Moscow, bowl-shaped fields, big frozen lake, rolling hills in the desert, the list goes on!boosting for 3+ seconds repairs your vehicle to an extent & is an interesting mechanicmany levels.  -even looking at each individual mode, there are a lot of maps to playCONSno career mode ('Challenge' is the closest thing with its linear progress)handling feels off & other cars seem to STICK to youNo AI in multiplayer (originally I thought there was, so I'm very sorry if I mislead anyone)unoptimized (ie: bad frame rate)    -depending on the map & your PC setup. Scroll to the bottom for my FIX for this.car deformation is worse than in other FlatOutscontrols can only be changed/checked via settings, off the main menu   -just like the other FlatOuts, but is still a bad design choice.Offroad mode only has 4 levels    -the most-fun mode IMO. technically 2, since 2 of them are the same map, just reversed.disconnects: I have experienced disconnect from the server about 20% of the time & it usually happens as I'm loading up -trying to transfer from- the Lobby to the map. TL;DR= You may have problems playing multiplayer, it just depends on your computer. (fyi, I've tested multiplayer both as host and not- both cause me to crash; I'm not sure why. I need to do further testing on my PC)TL;DR=Bigger derby levels versus MORE opponents,more cars, less customization, less optimized, but still a fun game if you just want to have fun and can look past the flaws.NOTE: I would recommend this ONLY if you spent about $2 or less for this game (as I paid $7.99 for the bundle); but the $30 base retail price is a rip-off.----------------------------------------------------Technical issuesThis game was inconsistent for me.Sometimes the load times were long, running off a HDD.Performance was terrible on SOME levels -if running off a Hard Disk Drive; I was getting as low as 6 fps on the 1st SplatOut map.But...when I ran it off a SSD, somehow it magically worked much much better for me & I suddenly got an average frame-rate well over 100 on Ultra. (I had my resolution down at 1180x800, fyi.)-----------update: changed 'bad handling' to 'handling feels off, is worse than it should be on most vehicles'update2: added 1 more con (disconnecting)update3 (04/09/2017): changed description about disconnects (under Cons) & added Con of 'no AI in mp'			"

												Don't EVER buy this piece of turd. It has nothing to do with Flatout. If a game gives you a hard time navigating through the menus you know something is up. The driving physics is messed up, it's something akin to Outrun instead of being arcade but a bit based in reality. It's like they haven't even tested it prior to release.			"

												Hit a shrubbery at 120km/h. It totaled my car. 1/10.Got this in the FlatOut bundle.  Definitely and by far the worst of the four.  Doesn't play anything like the rest of the franchise and the team that made this did it a disservice.  It's like Blur played with Micro Machines driven on ice and everything is boxy and glitters.  Several of the characters are obvious jabs at annoying celebrities, but they bring nothing interesting to the table.  After playing and enjoying all of the previous games in the series back to back, I played half of one track of F3 and couldn't stand to finish the race.  Every negative review of it is spot on.This series peaked at FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage in terms of graphics and full controller support (finally), but was handicapped by requiring Games for Windows Live.  Hopefully if/when Bugbear finishes Next Car Game, it'll be the FlatOut we've always dreamt of.			"

												I'd hoped they were all lies. Flatout created a format for success which the second one followed and improved on, but this, this cancer to the flatout series should be removed. It does not belong in such a series. The driving system in this game is worse than many flash racing games. Mario kart 64 handles more realisticly than this game by far. In addition, in the second race I ever played in this game I clipped through the ground. After that I just gave up on this game. THIS GAME IS BROKEN! Also, this game requires the highest hardware specs out of the series yet I think the turd I made this morning looks like a better racing game.I bought this game as part of a bundle. However, if you are just thinking about buying this game because you liked other flatout  games in this seris, DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME.			"

But the other levels....its a 1 vs 23 other fight, where every car has the mission to destroy you, and they are ignoring each other....This was the most worst 2 hrs of my life i spent in it!			"

												Ok. So Flatout 2 was so much fun, I though Flatout 3 should and would be much more fun. So much fun I would injure myself. Unfortunately the engine is in such a bad shape (did they downgrade it maybe?) that it actually made my eyes bleed a little. Flatout 3 is just a waste of money. Even if it would be a free gift to you. Go and get Flatout 2 for all I care (high jumping with a car and launching the driver is much more fun than I care to admit) but please just let Flatout 3 die a slow and silent death.

The cars seem locked to the road, with no power sliding or controlled pit manouvers etc. The controls are both unresponsive and over responsive at the same time making the cars (all of them) horrible to drive. The origional game had the cars physics and handleing down perfectly, the sequal tried to make things faster and lost some of that handling greatness. This is just plain JUNK!DO NOT BUY!			"

												When I first started playing this, I expected something better than Flatout 2. Instead, I got something very different. In Flatout 3, the racing mechanics are close to none, theres no feel to how fast you go, to how you should turn, its all very different. You just have to be the fastest, not the most skilled. Yes, I do agree the graphics have been upped, but thats not everything a racing game needs to have. Flatout 3 seems to have a lot of good things about it, like the many many many different variety and types of races, but again, its missing the core element, which is the driving. Another thing I noticed was that I were to be given this game without rading the title, I would not realize that this is of the Flatout series. This felt more of an arcade game than a sit-down-and-get-serious-to-race game, its like a 1999 arcade game just with the graphics of 2011. I seriously feel that this game could be improved.			"

There is no real storyline that is apparent or obvious, and the AI is pretty terrible as well. Loading times aren't great which is actually pretty surprising, and the tracks aren't even fun.Playing just a race and a half, I would not recommend at all.			"

												This is probably the worst game I've bought in the last few years. I bought it because I really enjoyed playing FlatOut 2. From the day I first played this steaming pile I've regretted it. Both the graphics and the gameplay are atrocious and I know of several games from the early 2000s that look and play better. The cars are basically uncontrollable and the tracks are terrible too. I unfortunately bought this back when there wasn't a Steam review system yet. The devs should be ashamed of ruining an IP like this.If there was one game I could get a refund on, it would be this.			"

												The only thing that is chaotic and destructive about this game are the ugly glitchy graphics, the balloon physics and the underwhelming damage model. For one, the game, as it is painfully obvious, is not even made by bugbear interactive, but by a studio named Team 6 who seem to be way off with their games quality.  It is unfortunate that this game has so much content to offer, but does it in such a disastrous and wasteful way. There are plenty of modes, with both old and new added to the mix with a variety of vehicles types, but nope! This just wont save this game from the shovelware/bargain bin For what is worth its kind of hilarious to play the game and then read its description.    "

Even if it would be a free gift to you.

Doesn't play anything like the rest of the franchise and the team that made this did it a disservice.  It's like Blur played with Micro Machines driven on ice and everything is boxy and glitters.  Several of the characters are obvious jabs at annoying celebrities, but they bring nothing interesting to the table.  After playing and enjoying all of the previous games in the series back to back, I played half of one track of F3 and couldn't stand to finish the race.  Every negative review of it is spot on.This series peaked at FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage in terms of graphics and full controller support (finally), but was handicapped by requiring Games for Windows Live.  Hopefully if/when Bugbear finishes Next Car Game, it'll be the FlatOut we've always dreamt of.			"

For one, the game, as it is painfully obvious, is not even made by bugbear interactive, but by a studio named Team 6 who seem to be way off with their games quality.  It is unfortunate that this game has so much content to offer, but does it in such a disastrous and wasteful way.

												Team 6 really put an effort into this game, unfortunately that effort was to make the game as unenjoyable, mundane, unsatisfactory, monotonous, tedious and lastly rage inducing (at having to pay a price for such disk clutter).If you tried Flatout and compared it to Flatout 3, you would be hard pressed to notice any game play difference apart from the garish new graphics in the case of the latter (yes Team 6 developed both games, and it tells).Yes you may say there is a lot of variety to the game, but its kind of like saying which style of shirt you would like to wear when you go and get a lobotomy.In my opinion the title is a typo, a more apt title would be FAIL-A-LOT 3 : Clumsy & Irritating			"

												How did they ♥♥♥♥ this game up so bad? F:UC felt good to play, but this game is a frustrating chore. Ramming other cars has no weight and pisses you of for the next 30 seconds when the other car is glued to your hood. The ""Power"" is merely slow motion where you can tap other racers to blow them up, but good luck finding any racers to ram, and good luck getting your power up more than twice per race. Not to mention it only lasts 5 seconds, so the most you can manage to do is kill only one racer out of a conglomerate total of 16 racers. 16 racers, yet most of the track is always empty, staying in between the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ racers that can barely finish the race whithin a week, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ first placer who finishes sooner than you can even expect. Buy this game if you're a cretin, otherwise ignore it to death. This is a really bad game.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Flatout series and have played Flatout 2 and Flatout Ultimate Carnage a lot with friends. This game has nothing in common with either of these two fantastic games. It's the biggest dissapointment I've ever had when it comes to games.Flatout 3 is a so horribly bad it's not worth your money. The graphics are bad, but most of all it's the complete lack of physics - that which made the previous games so great. The cars you drive have no weight and terrible handling. I played this game for 10 minutes, uninstalled it and never looked at it again. It's simply that bad. Just keep playing the terrific other Flatout games and pretend this abomination does not exist.

The fact that the technical graphics quality isn't on par with the Bugbear series doesn't help one bit.-This game constantly crashes, especially if you want to use a custom soundtrack.The only reason why this game was made so that Steam can sell the Flatout complete pack.  Don't even get that, even if it's on sale.  Just buy Flatouts 1 and 2 and you're good to go.			"

												I'd hoped they were all lies. Flatout created a format for success which the second one followed and improved on, but this, this cancer to the flatout series should be removed. It does not belong in such a series. The driving system in this game is worse than many flash racing games. Mario kart 64 handles more realisticly than this game by far. In addition, in the second race I ever played in this game I clipped through the ground. After that I just gave up on this game. THIS GAME IS BROKEN! Also, this game requires the highest hardware specs out of the series yet I think the turd I made this morning looks like a better racing game.I bought this game as part of a bundle. However, if you are just thinking about buying this game because you liked other flatout  games in this seris, DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME.			"

												I got this on sale in a bundle, thinking ""Can it really be that bad?"" Yes, yes it can. After attempting to play it, I wish I'd saved the 20 cents and just bought the games I actually wanted seperately.This game is simply unplayable. Even on the lowest settings the framerate refuses to go above 13 FPS on my i7-6700k/GTX 1070 rig. There are myriad of better games in this genre that actually work, Gas Guzzlers Extreme, Wreckfest, Flatout Ultimate Carnage, Carmageddon Max Damage, hell even Clutch is better than this game because Clutch ACTUALLY ♥♥♥♥ING WORKS. Don't get it, even if its on sale, even if its free, this game isn't worth the hard drive space.UPDATE: After finally getting this game working, I've discovered even more problems with it. Such as changing the graphics to ultra removing all texture from the folliage.			"

												Good graphic, bunch of cars, different kind of game types. It would be interesting game, BUT - driving and impact physics are so awful and unplayable, it ruined whole game...its nothing like Flatout 1 or 2			"

												DO NOT BUY!!! It has a meta score of OMG LOW!It's nothing compared to the original flatout. Just al ot of mini games, horrible physics (really!), car doesn't move like you want, AI messed up, graphics effects suck (wtf with the lighting on the cars), and the music is just a default beat tune on a ranndom audio mixer application.

												I Really don't like leaving negative reviews but i thought i'd write this as a warning to anyone considering buying this game, just don't it really is that bad, the handling model is way to floaty, the FPS goes anywhere from 160 fps to 4 fps, the game feels like an alpha not a finished game stay away.

												The only thing that is chaotic and destructive about this game are the ugly glitchy graphics, the balloon physics and the underwhelming damage model. For one, the game, as it is painfully obvious, is not even made by bugbear interactive, but by a studio named Team 6 who seem to be way off with their games quality.  It is unfortunate that this game has so much content to offer, but does it in such a disastrous and wasteful way. There are plenty of modes, with both old and new added to the mix with a variety of vehicles types, but nope! This just wont save this game from the shovelware/bargain bin For what is worth its kind of hilarious to play the game and then read its description.    "

												Ok. So Flatout 2 was so much fun, I though Flatout 3 should and would be much more fun. So much fun I would injure myself. Unfortunately the engine is in such a bad shape (did they downgrade it maybe?) that it actually made my eyes bleed a little. Flatout 3 is just a waste of money. Even if it would be a free gift to you. Go and get Flatout 2 for all I care (high jumping with a car and launching the driver is much more fun than I care to admit) but please just let Flatout 3 die a slow and silent death. So in short: yeah it sucks.			"

												This game sucks! Can i say anything else about it? No; it doesn't even deserve the metacritic 23/100. All the good sensations of the previous flatout games are gone. The cars feel like they're made of cardboard boxes or extra lightweight aluminum. It doesn't feel like driving a two tons muscle car anymore. Graphics and sounds are, well, ok i guess, but not as good as FO1 or FO2 or FOUC. Don't buy it. I did and had to ask for a refund.			"

												i feel like this game is a crappier ripp off of flatout 2 i suggest that more because the maps cars and ovreall game is better in every way shape and form. yes there are less modes and the graphics and ai could be improved but chances are if your looking at this game then you are looking for some nostalgia so do not get flatout 3 but definitly get flatout 2			"

												Before: Great expectations.After: Total disappointment. I can't even put in into words...The first two games are great but this is a total mess. I absolutely don't recommend it to anyone... DO NOT BUY IT!As other mentioned before me. The only flatout in this game is the name.I'm glad it was on a discount - it really doesn't worth the 29,99 EUR price.			"

												No, no no no. The graphic quality, mechanics, and general feel go straight down the drain from the last game. It is a different game entirely from a different developer. Should have just bought what I wanted seperately instead of the bundle.			"

												Alright wow, where to begin with this game? Whooo weee. Alright lets get started.The... Pros?To be honest, Its hard to really think of any, I got barely into the game before it started crashing so I guess this is off the list..The Cons.Basicly this game is poorly put together, using the most generic looking models, the most generic music, the most generic AND I KID YOU NOT GENERIC sounds Ive ever heard, No joke that like 'Chink' noise you hear from like I dunno any youtube intro back in 2010? its all over the place. Graphicly this game is hideous, Everything is flat and rusty and low res. Lighting might as well be not there at all as its all this ugly yellow. Anything besides race mode crashes your game, first time I started racing the game dropped to 0 FPS for about a full 3 seconds only to shoot up to 80. and I am running a brand new high end GPU.If you see the game don't get it, want a destruction derby style racing game? Get the first flatout.Flatout don't buy.			"

												This isn't new news to anyone, but this is a horrible game. Its nothing more than a shamless cash-in to the Flatout name. With licensed cars with little changes to them to make them unlicensed (Because apparently, that works). Oh, and then theres the gameplay. All the cars handle like boats, the physics are both light and heavy at the same time, and the damage is just... There is none. All you get is your doors swinging open and closed, the bumpers swinging to the point where it looks weird, and that's it. And when your wreck, all your parts fly off completely and the body is just there, without so much as a dent on it. The ""drivers"" are intresting too. You either got a fetish female, a random dude, or some schmuck that was probably based off a character from a movie or videogame. And, Team6 somehow managed to screw up the ragdolling too. You have an Aftertouch (name stolen from Burnout 3 by the way) bar that limits your character's movement. After the bar is empty you can't move. Oh, and on a topic of dumb mechanics, your boost heals you. I don't even know... I really don't. You want a decent flatout? Get 1, 2, Ultimate Carnage, and 4. Sure, 4 is once again not being made by Bugbear and Empire Interactive, but at least its not this. At least Bigben and Kyltonn tried. Oh, and I find it funny  that in one of the trailers it says, ""From the publishers who brought you Flatout and Flatout 2"". And yet, Empire Interactive didn't even touch this game. I played this for 41 minutes and the only way I'll keep it in my game collection is if you drop the price to at least $2.00 and lower. Its certainly not worth $30.00 or $6.00. Maybe, $0.50.			"
