												A neat little Unity racing game that I feel doesn't quite have enough content to support its $4.99 price tag. The game itself is completely functional and plays well, however the issue I had is that I just wasn't satisfied with the amount of content for the price I had paid. Yes, I know. Five bucks really isn't that much money, but considering all the other 'neat little Unity racing games' on Steam within the same price range, RC Mini Racers is pretty disappointing by comparison.There is quite a number of levels, however they all take place within the same map, utilizing the same assets, which eventually (and relatively quickly) become visually fatiguing. This could have been excusable if the surprisingly large and diverse lineup of vehicles had more varied handling. There's not much point to saving your coins to unlock a flashy new car when it doesn't handle that much differently than the bulky pickup truck you're initially given at the start of the game.Unfortunately, these two major flaws really affected my incentive to play the game, and after an hour and a half of game play time, I felt like I'd already seen all the game had to offer. In summary, the game is functionally good, but definitely lacking in content. In my opinion, $0.99c would be a much more palatable price!			"

												Is it worth the £3.99 price tag? Maybe, depends how much you like these sort of games but on a solo stand point since there is no multiplayer which is disapointing as Multiplayer would literally make this game perfect. The gameplay is really damn good, I bought this in a bundle and immediately loved playing it, it even has it's own steering setup so you can decide the brake force, steering angle (basically how far the car will turn) even adjusting it based on slow and high speed. The physics are a bit weird and you can't control the vehicle in the air but it makes for some cool things to happen and crashing it to other cars can be quite funny. You can 'pimp' your car with credits but damn it's expensive, it says 'In app purchases' on the store when choosing to buy things but I haven't seen a way to actually pay money so I don't believe you can though the coins can take some time to get since there is a mode for reaching coins on a track which can be quite difficult to get to and converting your in game $ to coins (250k for 1 coin, 55 Coins for another set of wheels.).TL;DR: Overall the game is pretty fun and the current game time I've enjoyed it and can see myself playing more but for the current price I'd say be hesitant and may try to get it in a bundle (Groupees at the time of this review) or on sale.I give it an 8/10 for being a fun, quite well optimised physicy racing game!

												What is RC Mini Racers?Genre: Racing gameSetting: RC car racing in a suburban nieghborhoodDifficulty: 3/10 --> basically easyLength: 2 hours for a single playthrough, up to 6 for completing every track in every difficultyMode: singleplayer campaignThe positive aspects:- RC racing cars resembling real cars in a funny way- runs perfectly and smoothly, constantly high framerate- basically no loading timesThe negative aspects:- no car tuning (=cars' stats are all the same), only cosmetical changes which cost a fortune- only a few circuits, always in the same nighborhood, only marked out differently- repititive gameplay, lack of content- two totally imbalanced currencies. In order to unlock all tracks and cars grinding is inevitable- only three power-ups (rocket, mine, turbo boost)Result (and summary for those who have no time reading):RC Mini Racers is good for an hour or two, after that the lack of car stats and/or tuning and also tracks makes the game boring. Not recommended - there are better games out there.			"

												RC Mini racers reminds me much of Revolt, but without the imagination.The game involves racing toy RC cars around various tracks in either of 3 modes, Circuit Race, Sprint and Coin Race. Circuit is exactly that, Srint is A to B and Coin Race has you searching the map for randomly sporning coins. At the end od each race you win money that can be used to unlock other tracks or can be saved up to by coins.Coins are used to unlock other RC Cars or mod them by changing the colour or wheels or the arial. Getting coins can be either fun or a grind depending on your point of view as it takes quite a while to aquire them.The graphics are basic but suitable for this budget racer. The only fault I noticed was occasionally the wheels clipping through the floor. One other perculiarity I noticed is that the wheels are not actually attached to the vehicle. While this in no way spoils the game, it just look strange when the cars flip over.Control is by either keyboard or game pad. Controls are not changable so your stuck with what is. I use the gamepad and steering, accerate and brake are all on the left thumbstick. Dual thumbsticks would have been much better, or at least the option of.The gamepad only controls the cars though, not the menu. So mouse clicking is also a must.The cars themselves sound and handle like toy electric rc cars from the local toyshop. So don't expect any Pro racing here. Weapons are also included, Missles, mines and a speed boost.This game is a fun single player ( no multiplayer ) rc racer with weapons. Its a budget game but does what it does pretty well. As long as you don't expect to much from it its worth the asking price.Good, well done. "

												I can't recommend it to anyone but small children.Graphics are good, the backyard setting is cool, and the physics are ok. That's where the good stuff end.The gameplay is just meh. The money/shop/unlocks just doesn't work. And the game is waaaay too easy: I've beaten most tracks on insane (highest difficulty) with the first car (the only one I've got, it's pointless to save a loooot of money to get another). It's both too easy and the sense of progression was really not really thought out. In fact there isn't any. Unlocking tracks is also a silly chore as you don't get enough money to unlock the next even when you win a race, forcing you to race it again even if you didn't like it or if it was way too easy (it always is).The races are fun here and there, with a little bit of chaos at the very start. Why do we always start last by the way? No clue but it has to be because the start is the only fun you'll have. After 30 seconds it gets boring as you'll be up front and nothing goes on. Sure there are mines and missiles but they don't even slow you down. In fact hitting mines can be good as it gives you money for air time (?) while not slowing you down.Usually during races I find myself trying to get turbos instead of mines or missiles, not to actually pass anyone but just so that the races end sooner because I'm just too bored while ""racing"". There's a ""car reset"" for when you get stuck (?) but you never get stuck. You never end upside down or anything. But the computer resets its cars all the time, which contributes for the game being sooo easy to beat.On the technical side there are some things that are just lazy. The key binding options are on the launcher. Then I can't unbind a joystick. To make it worse, I have some 5 joysticks (wheel, pedals, shifter, gamepad, button box...) connected to the PC but the game only recognizes 1. That means that ""button 3"" in any of the controllers will have that effect, or at least seems like it. I didn't test a lot because I just preferred to play with the keyboard instead.Even small details started to bother me just for corners being cut in the programming, like my ears getting blasted by loud sound for a quick moment when the game is launched before the in-game audio volume settings ""kick in"". A shame really, I like the genre and I like the idea but this title just falls short of delivering an entertaining experience.I'd recommend Death Rally instead. It's top down view but it sure delivers in terms of fun and enjoyment what this one fails to.			"

												No, i`m sorry but Revolt is still much funnier and can make even new players learn it.RC Mini Racers is not Revolt, cars are a bit bigger, controlling using keyboard is not that impressive and the AI is a challenge even from Easy races, so new players might not be impressed to pay 4,99 euros.Revolt is abandonware so you might want to try it before buying this, maybe just maybe i`m to old fashioned... and this RC Mini Racers game could be great.

												Oh if only this game had multiplayer... it would be worth twice its price.The driving is fun, you pick up power ups on the road, you have missles and mines which add a fun mayhem to each race.It has a good soundtrack, punk rock that sounds like the classics (Offspring, Blink 182 etc)The downside is that the progression system is weakly designed (for example, you earn same amount of cash for 1st place on Easy and the same amount for 1st place on highest difficulty) and small variety of environments (you have one big map on which all tracks are set on)But nevertheless it is great fun, it reminded me of the good old days when I was playing Re-volt. If only this game had multiplayer so that you could race your friends and a replay system to save and watch some crazy sh*t happening during racing... this game would be EPIC FUN			"

												-This is a cute game.Great for a five dollar price tag, but lacks multiplayer.  After a few minutes I found myself yerning for some split screen or LAN action.The IGC is okay, but Coins should be easier to get without waisting time in a specific mode. they should be rewarded after the completion of a race.Money is useless until you get 250k then you can turn it into 5 coins, which is reasonable since money is easy to get.Over all this game is good at what it does. It just needs multiplayer and more maps.I suggest opening it to the workshop if you dont feel like making more maps.If you are bored and want something to pass time, this is a decent cheap game to do that on.BUTIf you are looking for an in depth RC racing simulator with tons of maps, this isnt for you. however there are quite a few vehichles so yay to that.Open this bad boy to the work shop.

												What can i say...Just don'tNot the worst game i have played, but something in this day I cannot recommend.-During my first stage, the car leaned right the entire race-you have to start on easy before you can play on normal. Can't just start on normal-Taking turns almost always ends in spinning out-during all maps I would go from being in 2nd or 3rd, to magically being in 9th or 10th.-resetting your car will put you in last place-says partial controller support, wrong, no controller support(game didnt recognize analog stick)these are the more important flaws I found with the gameplay.I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.

												The game is not bad for a few bucks but the tracks look all very alike since they're mostly in the same area.There are a bunch of nice vehicles you can unlock but you'll be bored with the game way before you collect them all.Steering mechanics are OK. Only half of controller is supported which keeps racing akward.			"

												Terrible terrible unfinished buggy pile of garbage. Seriously, don't waste your time. I expect this was intended to be a high school kid's senior project. It should never have been released to the general public.The menus are straight from the N64. The strangest part is you earn money when you race that you can use to unlock other tracks, you cannot buy cars or mods (colors and rims, no upgrades) with money. For that you need to buy ""coins"" that can in turn be used to buy cars and mods...How stupidly unnecessary is that?The control scheme is not set up for the XB360 controller and in fact cannot even be configured on the two triggers for brake and reverse because it only uses one axis. The cars are floaty and prone to flipping. When I say ""cars"" I mean car. I only tried out one because that's all you can choose from until you buy some coins to buy more cars. Based on the maneuverabilty of the AI cars though there doesn't seem to be any difference. Also, the tracks are not well designed and it's easy to exploit them to get far ahead of the AI racers. Normally I'd call this a ""shortcut"" but it feels more like bad design considering how easy it is.But hey, you can put your FPS on the screen...in case you want to benchmark with this crap. Because I'm sure that has come up before. You can also manually adjust the steering levels, because the developer couldn't be bothered to make the cars driveable. Maybe you'll have better luck!			"

												Short review:4/10Completed main game in ~75 minutes Positive + Car models are well designed+ The system of unlocking vehicles and maps is a nice idea+ No game breaking glitches and it works fairly well.+ Graphics are decent (but a little inconsistent) Negative - Very little character is added to the game and it doesn't seem like there's anything unique to seperate it from other racing games.- The environments aren't very detailed and are quite basic. It doesn't seem like enough creativity was put into designing the environments because it doesn't seem like there's anything at all interesting about it. Each circuit is a small section of one map (a neighbourhood) but there's not really anything interesting about the map.-The circuits aren't layed out very well as it doesn't give you a good sense of direction and i found myself getting disorientated, especially in the maps where the track loops in on itself because it isn't seperated well enough and the arrows don't always point to the right direction.- Music is completely generic and not engaging. Every track is generic rock, which isn't bad but it's very boring and repetitive. Sound effects are a little better, but not much.-Gameplay feels like a grind if you want to unlock vehicles as it takes a very long time to unlock them. I had finished the game and didn't even get close to unlocking any new cars. It seems pointless to have to unlock the circuits if you just get enough money from doing each race to unlock the next race anyway.-From what I can tell, the other vehicles have nothing different about them anyway, so they don't actually control any differently from the regular car.- UI is basic (but functional)- Only 3 powerups, which are mostly pointless. The mine is OK, but the homing missile seems to not work very well and sometimes randomly picks a target rather than going in a direction that makes sense and the boost is annoying since it makes it difficult to control, and most of the circuits aren't big enough for the boost to be particularly useful anyway.- 3 modes which aren't very interesting and no multiplayer mode.It's not a bad game, but it's just not very interesting and honestly there's a lot of other games on steam which are better, and it feels like it would be a decent free to play game, but not a game that you should spend money on. For a game that was made in 2015, unfortunately it feels similar to the freeware games made in 2005. That said, it's not the worst game on steam by far, it's not not really  good .			"

												Where do i start with this game? I got it as a deal, so was happy there, thought it looked like a bit of fun to blow off an hour or so, But boy was a i wrong. Opened game, turned overly loud music down abit, hopped into the first race, and the car is constantly turning left, holding right turns it right, let go and it goes straight back to turning left.It is stupid and impossible to play, I restarted the game, redownloaded the game and still the same problem.There is no way i can recommend this game as there is really no way to play it effectively without your fingers getting sore.

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordI expected this game to be total crap, but actually, its pretty good.-GraphicsThe graphics were obviously not the best, but i really loved them! I'm a huge fan of this type of graphics.You are able to change Wheels, paint and Antenna color of your car (Which costs coins, not p2w)-GameplayThe game features 16 Circuit Maps, 8 Sprint Maps and Coin Racing (which i didnt try).It shows the laps left, also on Sprint Maps sadly. It shows ""1/1 Lap"" instead of ""20km left"" or something.There are really many cars availiable (~30 i guess) which as much as i've noticed dont give any advantage (except for better ""rolling"" maybe, im not sure about that though). In the Pimp Shop you can configure their Wheels, Paint and Antenna which costs Coins.There are two different currencies: Dollars and Coins. You can get coins by converting 250k$ into 5 Coins.You get ~50-100k$ per race, a Car costs ~20 Coins, do the maths...Tracks also cost dollars, so dont waste all your money on cars.Also, there are 4 different difficulties, Easy, Medium, Hard and Insane.I jumped from Easy to Insane and noticed no difference. The game is pretty easy, if i want i can be 1st in every single race. The Bots are just too bad.Oh, you've also got Mines and Missles :3-SoundsThe Audio was insanely loud when starting it (Its just my fault i guess, should finally lower windows volume >.<)Other than that, the sounds were pretty good.I only heared one song, muted the music then though because i had my own music running. Its not too bad.-ControlsThe controls are basically W,A,S,D to accelerate, brake and turn your vehicle, space to shoot missles and C to throw mines.-QualityThe quality was a lot higher than expected.The Sprint mode only shows Laps (1/1 Laps) instead of KM left or something.You are able to set the resolution in the Launcher which is insanely great!The Escape button doesnt work always.The Bots are really bad.Well, thats it, its a really fun game for a while, had fun for 50 Minutes and will definetly have fun for 5-10 more hours in the future!-Overall ExperienceThe Game really is great! There are some little bugs which dont really matter, the only bad thing is bots being insanely bad even on the ""Insane"" difficulty, but thats it. Other than that its a great RC Racing Game ^^			"

												Wasn't sure at 1st with the mixed ratings but actually this is a great little racer to pass the odd half hour here and there. In order to play more levels or get a better car you must win races or at least compete in races and build up your funds so you can continue and this makes it more engaging. If you like Mario Kart or Tux Racer you'll enjoy this.			"

												This is a perfectly decent game. The gameplay is just nuanced enough to be fun; there are only two weapons and one power-up; however, they're flying around the screen at every moment, and no two races are quite the same. Apparently, this was a top iOS app; I could see it as being pretty excellent for a mobile racing game. However, myriad ""port-problems"" do exist; sometimes, the cars pull a little bit to the left or right, and I'm not completely certain why that may be. The cars are WAY too expensive to unlock (expect 1-2 hours of gameplay PER vehicle), and every single one of them seems to have the exact same stats. Also, modifying your vehicle in ANY WAY requires 4-5 hours of gameplay; absolutely ludicrous for a new color, or new tire skin. I wouldn't recommend this game at full price. However, if you're getting a bundle of 7-8 games for $2.00? If you're interested at all in racing, I'd say this is worth a solid 1-2 hours of mildly amusing gameplay. It's definitely a good bundle toy.Cheers!			"

												I didn't even get to really play the game as the steering is just horrendous. If you want to play Joypad then the steering, accelerate and brake are all on the left stick with no option to change the controls. If you play keyboard only the steering constantly drifts to the right. It's a shame as it's look pretty good and runs smoothly and these aren't issues that would take that long to fix, but in it's current state it's just unplayable.			"
