								The Good:An excellent multiplayer experience that hearkens back to the lively days of Nintendo couch co-op playing Super Smash Bros. or Super Mario KartFast and frantic racing-style gameplay that constantly sees twists and turns as far as who is in the leadOutlandish and colorful characters and maps that really complement the ecclectic nature of the gamePower-ups are an absolute riot with constant changes to the way the player moves through the levelMy personal favorite was the grappling hook, which grabs the closest player to you and throws him backwards, hilarity quickly ensuingControls are very tight and responsive, which is crucial in a platforming game of this natureAnimation and physics are spot-on and help convey the sense of motion and weight to the charactersGraphics are sharp and vibrant, which are very welcome in a 2D gameMaps are intricately made with what appears to be a pain-staking attention to detailTurbo generators, swing-able ceiling tiles, lasers, and buzz-saws are a some of the well placed items in a map that can make or break your “speed run”Current content on this “Early Access” title is more than enough to have a good time with your Steam friends, but the promise of more content updates just sweetens the pot on this gameActive developers that constantly respond and engage their audience in the development of the gamePrimarily in the Steam ForumsThe Bad:The good times had while playing the game is diminished when playing without friends you know, but that’s not to say it still isn’t funCan you play it while the children are awake?:Absolutely.  In fact, I played it with my 7 year old and had a blast!Did I make time to complete it?:With a multiplayer-based game, completion isn’t really a question.  Did I have a blast playing numerous races with my friends? Yes.  Do I foresee myself doing so again in the future? Absolutely.Redlight or Greenlight?:A most definite Green light on this one.  greenThe great times already had with this title make it worth picking up nowRecommended Purchase Price:$9.99A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy:http://www.gamersglance.com "

								A creatively imagined multiplayer game. A surprisingly pleasant alternative to the brawler-type of multiplayer that has become so commonplace (e.g. samurai gunn, starwal, towerfall, bit-brawlers, brawlhalla, etc...), SpeedRunners offers players a spectrum of depth in gameplay. At its base, this game is a racing platformer, rewarding players who learn the turns and obstacles of various unique levels while punishing those who make mistakes. Perfectionism at its finest. This fine work does offer a deeper level of competition, however, if players chooses to exploit the nuances of the game's physics. With the mention of the glory of this game, I must also point out the negatives, which are frustratingly apparent within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. The matchmaking system is extremely unreliable, despite the implementation of a ranking system (albeit new). There are constant bugs in just about any multiplayer game, which would be endurable in a more forgiving game. The glitches can be brutal, and, due to the competitive nature of this game, they do not come off as humorous as in other games. At the rate at which this game has improved recently and with the massive community of stakeholders which it has garnered, SpeedRunners, while still in Beta at the moment of this review, will doubtlessly become one of the flawless go-to's for just about any friendly LAN party and competitive tournament. Each complaint I have for this game is tied to a problem that any early access game would have, and they are no reason to avoid a purchase. Currently an 8 / 10, this game is an easy pick-up and a difficult put-down!			"

								Not played a game in a LONG LONG time that offers tons of fun, replayability and humour, but when a friend gifted me this I had a feeling that this game was a MASTERPIECE... and I was right.I played with two other friends and the experience was absolutely amazing, I was shocked on the Price mainly and how low it was for a game with such quality (It is ONLY in ALPHA too!). You become extremely focused and attached to the game, focusing on beating your opponents on a variety of maps, using powerups on each other, taking different routes and constantly gathering more skill each time you play and that is what I enjoyed the most about the game. Each time you play it, you feel like you are getting better, leading to you becoming attached to the game. It is also a great laugh with friends, using powerups on each other and just being the biggest troll ever. What amazed me was how easy and simple it is to create maps, also the game is workshop supported! Create it in-game, share it instantly to workshop for all of the community to see... it isn't as complicated as map-making when it comes to Source Games (Garry's Mod, Team Fortress, Counter Strike). There is also ranking if you feel confident enough in beating other players and being the absolute best speedrunner.The only downside is that the Keyboard Controls are yuck... I have began using a Gamepad and find it easier. You can customise the controls of course but I just cannot find the right setup for me.Just make sure you have friends to play it with!			"

								Let me preface this with the following: SpeedRunners is worth all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the 10 dollars earned for buying this terriffic game. SpeedRunners is a god damned anomaly, being in Early Access has not hindered this game's meaningfullness as a medium for entertainment and competitiveness. SpeedRunners features some really balanced gameplay, your skill is your skill, nothing else is the determining factor for success. You will run, jump, slide, and grapple your way through a series of levels, designed by mere mortals, as if they were designed my gods. The only downside of this otherwise shining example of video game excellence, is the gosh darned lag! Lag can sometimes mess up an entire match, however, lately the net code has been polished to a shine, and is suitable for those who can't afford the highest internet. Overall, I would give SpeedRunners a 9/10, it's fun, it's competitive, and it's everything you want it to be.			"

								Overall, this game is great, but there are a few things that I think could've been done better.+Main game is incredibly fun. I still find myself coming back to it sometimes. This game has an original concept that they executed very well, and in result the main part of the game is great.+Lots of characters, with different customization options+Lots of maps (not a whole lot of official ones, but that's what the workshop is for)+Workshop is great, you can make your own levels and submit them, and play other people's as well. There are also top levels of the week, etc.+The game keeps updating and in my opinion the updates point to a good direction for the game+The community is pretty large, you can usually find people online and there are lots of tournaments and such that are supported by the dev team+Leagues, XP, etc.+-The community is so-so ingame, everyone you play with online is either very nice and mature or just very rude and immature. I haven't really found a lot of the in betweens, though I don't play online a whole lot either.+-The AIs can play some workshop maps fine, but others they just get stuck, go the wrong way, etc.-The soundtrack can get horribly repetitive. It's okay, but I usually turn my sound off because a lot of the time it's the same song and it just gets on my nerves tbh.-The campaign is bad. Like, not a little bad, REALLY bad. They should've just kept it out in my opinion. There's basically no story (well there is but it's not much of one), only about less than an hour total to complete it, and almost every single level in it is either way too easy or way too hard.-It is crazy the amount of bugs you can find by just playing it for maybe 30 minutes. I understand it's in early access (the time I'm writing it is), but there are so many times where the screen borders aren't really the borders for the level, AIs go the wrong way (only seen this on a couple maps now, they fixed most of them but it's still weird) and the wrong person will get the point sometimes. However, they are also fixing a lot of these, so soon hopefully most of these will be gone.Nonetheless, despite the bugs (the game is still very playable, please don't take what I said the wrong way), this game is awesome. It is so much fun to play by yourself, even more so with friends (jk, like I have a social life or something), and is just overall fun.Rating: 8/10			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: SpeedRunners Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Racing; Multiplayer; Action; MOBA My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Primary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Multiplayer gamersI received an activation key of this game from a press kit for the purposes of writing a review.  This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.REVIEWSpeedrunners is a 2D-sidescroller that mixes in some elements of speed-platforming, combat-racing, and modern MOBA-lite games.  It plays like something you may find as a minigame mode in a Mario Party game.The matches are played as a footrace through 2D circuit maps where the object is to get so far ahead of your opponents that they fall of the edge of the map.  There are boosts and grappling hooks you must learn to use effectively on each map to move quickly.  There are also pick-ups like rockets and freezing laser beams to add that right touch of chaos to the races.You have the option to play custom matches with bots, or with local players for good-old-time couch coop with your friends.  There are both quick match and ranked match options for automatic online matchmaking.  The ranked match mode has a progression system and point leaderboards.Most of the variety in the game comes from the various maps.  And the Steam Workshop means infinite possibilities for maps.  Some users have already created some pretty interesting maps.  There are also many characters to choose from, with several of them being crossovers from other games.   They seem to have differing animations but no differences in abilities.The graphics are pretty much what you would expect from a modern 2D-sidescroller.  The music and sounds fit the style of the game; and I believe there is a community guide available that shows you how to easily integrate your own music into the game.  The controls are fluid and intuitive; I personally used a controller and thought the controls were pretty optimal.  Lastly, I didn’t experience any glitches or crashing… although some people have reported crashing on certain Workshop maps.The game does what it does well, undoubtedly.  With the Workshop and the ease of modding of this game, there is definitely a bright future ahead for Speedrunners and a vast sea of possibilities.  I look forward to seeing what else is added to the game in the future.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												For those people who are concerned with long term playtime: I've played this game for about what now... 2 years? I've had many moments of success and shortcomings. If you want to grab a game and play it competitively, this is your game. It won't be long until you see how far you've gotten. Now how do you begin? Well I recommend grabbing some friends and playing with them for a short while so you can get used to the controls and all the maps. As you play through the game you'll recognize there will always be better ways to run them. With that being said now go have fun with this game!			"

Early Access Review
								For this game, simplicity is what makes SpeedRunners so effective. The concept is very straightforward - and makes you rethink about the traditional style of typical racing games. You control a motley cast of random characters (with some specials guests here and there) and you race by trying to outrun each other. The core mechanics of SpeedRunners are implemented just fine, and can be quite exhilarating with the use of the grappling hook, as it's very satisfying to pull off, and will get you massive air and acceleration when used correctly. Visually and aesthetically speaking, SpeedRunners keeps things simple for the sakes of getting players to remain focused on racing, with a pleasant, cartoony art style that gets the job done. The soundtrack isn't that diverse but has a few catchy songs to keep the races tense. There's also a bit to do, with a standard story mode, an online and offline playing system, and even a workshop to create new stages for you and the community to play with, SpeedRunners is quite a bit more indepth with it's content. The game as of this review is still holding the status of being ""Early Access"", so in the future there may be even more to do.I do have some issues with balancing: which is primarily centred around the use of items. They're a welcome addition as a whole, but I wish that they were taken out of competitive online play (ranked matches) as they can heavily interfere with your progression in levelling up in a way that just isn't fair. Ranking systems in online matches on multiplayer games that punish you for losing by taking away rank points is a practice that generally annoys me, but the chance of items does bug me even more.And I just wish that some of the items themselves were tonned down a bit. The golden grappling hook is just not fun to play against. And from my experiences, the game crashes on me almost every ten minutes. Other times it can take a while to crash, once I've booted up the game, and over times it can take under five minutes to crash. My friend doesn't have this issue at all, but from my research, this happens to many people who have played this game. It may be due to the game still not being complete, but if this issue could be addressed as soon as possible, then my enjoyment of this game would be even better, but as of this review; I can't play this game for more than about twenty minutes at max before the game crashes, and I have to reboot it. Overall though, I'd recommend SpeedRunners if you're looking for something simple to get into, yet enjoyably challenging to master. this game requires practice and patience when playing against good players. It's a new take on racing games, and especially for an indie, early access, the product as of now is a well crafted game.			"

Lack of advertising for the game. Not many people buy it. Please, buy it.It may not look visually appealing, or promising, but that's what even I thought before I actually went ahead and bought it.

								To put it simple, could be described as 2D Mario Kart with legs. Four players running around a map with varied obstacles collecting different power ups and weapons. Game really shines when played with friends, especially if you can get them in the same room. Can be played against bots and also has little singleplayer campaign. Controls feel tight and races get really exciting. Could use some more of official maps, some workshop maps are a bit buggy or just confusing. All characters perform the same, but all have their own unique and sometimes funny animations that really add tasty flavor to the game. Also more varied soundtrack would be welcomed. Really fun game that works well for early acces.[Score: 84]			"

tl;dr -> Mario Kart on foot. If you ever wanted to punch your friends in the face, play this game instead. 11/10 you'll want to punch them in the face anyway.I was fortunate enough to get this game gifted to by a friend, and I was very excited to try it out after seeing all the powerful positive reception. I was very satisfied with my experience, and this has easily become one of my top (local) multiplayer games. If you like comedic racing with item pickups (in the vein of games like Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing), then you will really enjoy this game. The aesthetics are good - the detail in the environment is nice, and the artsyle is colorful and matches the tempo of the game. The different character models are well-done, and some of them have interesting jump animations (ex: the shark character dives forward and the cat character rides a broom). The music and sounds are very good, however, I usually play my own music to add to the intensity of the gameplay. Controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. I strongly recommend playing with a controller - especially if you are doing local multiplayer. The tutorial is quick and very helpful in showing you all the game mechanics. The learning curve is mostly minimal, however, mastering the game and understanding each map takes some time. Maintaining momentum is critical to success, and practice will really help you understand the most efficient way to traverse through each map (ex: knowing when to jump vs. double-jump to get across a section). Whenever I play with my friends, we like to start from the first map and play through all the available ones (they are ranked in ascending order of difficulty). Gameplay really shines if you can play (local or online) with a few friends - this is my top local multiplayer game at the moment of writing this review. As you race, the screen gradually shrinks toward the middle, and touching the red edges (usually happens if you are trailing behind) will cause you to explode and be knocked out. Interestingly, there have been rare moments where being in the lead too much has caused me to die (but I think it's because I touched the ""ceiling"" before the lagging players could be knocked out. 4 players can play at a time, and the round ends whenever only one player remains - the first to 3 points wins the map. Whenever a round ends, all players will respawn in the immediate area (this can cause hilarious situations if the starting point is somewhere very inconvenient - like a multiple wall-jumping area). My friends and I have gotten the screen to shrink into an extremely tiny square in the middle (we don't know if there is an upper limit for how small the screen can get) before someone won. Throughout the map, there are hazards like spikes/lasers (they will stun you for a few crucial seconds), boxes (usually a set of them in a row), and drops (insta-death). Boxes respawn, and a common technique is to let someone take the lead initially if you are unfamiliar with the map - especially since momentum can cause you to hit multiple boxes if you aren't fast enough in recovering. Usually, there are switches throughout the map that allow the person in the lead to manipulate the field a bit. For example, triggering a switch (you just need to run over it) may cause a route to be blocked off, opening a new one for the people behind you that is longer/more difficult. Sometimes, however, it is a better idea to avoid the switch, as they may also open routes that act as shortcuts for people lagging behind. There are also items you can pick up, and this is my favorite part of the game - I am an item ♥♥♥♥♥, and will purposely go for items just to see what I randomly get. Pickups may be things like homing rockets, a set of boxes you can drop, a pulling hook (switched places between you and the person in the lead), or a freezing beam. I do not know if this is a bug, but something I've encountered is a delay when you use the ice beam right before a round ends - instead of having the item wasted, it seems to activate right after the next round starts, freezing anyone in front of you. There are white areas on the ceilings that allow you to use your grappling hook to swing around. Some advanced techniques include swinging to propel yourself up a wall-jumping area and swinging to redirect your forward momentum (in the right direction). Boost areas also litter the map, and using a boost will make your character move considerably faster. Your boost gauge carries over even after death, so one technique I use it to save my boost for an ideal situation (ex: don't waste it if I am extremely far behind). All of the DLC's are for purely cosmetic - there are no differences between characters except for the movement animations. From what I've experienced, the online multiplayer community is both active and friendly.Overall, the game is fantastic for anyone who enjoys comedic, fun racing. It is currently a steam daily deal, and this price is honestly a steal - even if you were to treat it as a finished product with no future developer support.Strongly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

Early Access Review
IntroductionSpeedrunners is a brilliant, 2d, sidescrolling, racing game where you race against up to 3 players, locally or online in a battle of speed and wits. I used to dislike this game, until very recently when it was much less buggy and I got to understand the mechanics of the game. It is early-access, but a very good one at that. Continue reading, to learn more.GameplayYour goal in speedunners, is essentially to win the race. However, there aren't any laps, nor are there any special objectives. Instead, all of you have to do is be so far ahead of the rest of the racers, that they vanish off the screen. The race screen follows the leader, so it is key to stay close to the leader in order to stay alive. Once the opposing racers have hit the bounds of the screen, you as the leader win a round. Winning 3 rounds makes you the overall winner of the race. Sounds fairly easy? Well it would be, if this game didn't have items or grappling hooks.The grappling hook is one of the most useful and essential items in this game. It allows you to traverse terrain rapidly, or continue your momentum, which is key for this type of game. Any roof-like area with a white patch can be grappled at any time once your hook can hit it.Items complete this game, turning it from Need for Speed, to Mario Kart. A well timed shockwave can block enemy yellow grappling hooks, while an Invinci-Drill can bring a player from last place to the lead in a matter of seconds. The items give this game an important element of skill and timing. Wasting a valuable item can leave you open to attack from your opponents, and many times, it could be the last mistake you ever make as your opponent speeds his ways past you with a well timed grapple, into boost.There are also unique stage elements which make the gameplay vary. There are usually multiple paths to get to a destination, Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some paths may have a boost charger, but may trigger a lever that opens a path with item pickups. If you're careful enough you can dodge these levers, but it's not always possible.Momentum is a key mechanic in this game, which seperates newbies from pros. Learning the levels, as well as timing your grapples, boosts and jumps are essential to going through an area at top speed and leaving all the competition behind.There are many unlockables in the form of characters and outfits, as well as a rewarding levelling system. Fancy a more serious challenge? Head to ranked where the bravest challengers make their names known.VisualsThe visual style of this game is simplistic, yet effective. I especially love the visuals for super speed. The game really emphasizes the sense of speed you get after well timed jumps, grapples and boosts. However it's nothing mind-blowing, it's just neatly done.AudioI like the sounds in the game. The music is always upbeat and gives you a proper adrenaline rush especially in those clutch moments where you're neck and neck with your opponent. Summary & ConclusionSpeedrunners is turning out to be quite the impressive game. I normally don't recommend early-access games to people very quickly, however I must make an exception here, as right now this game has a lot already, and feels pretty well polished in all aspects.For a highly competitive, super fun, racing and parkour game, Speedrunners is defintely worth playing.8/10 Worth buying9/10 With friendsIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												This game is absolutely stellar.The game's strong point is the online multiplayer where you battle it out in what can best be described as a amalgymation of MarioKart, Sonic, and Smash Bros.  This is an excellent party game if you have friends over.The mechanics seem simple at first, but as you play through the game you'll realize that they are all intertwined in such a way that you can play in ways unimaginable to your newbie self.  You constantly encounter people who have mastered aspects of the game that you weren't even aware of.  There is virtually no limit to how good you can get.  The gameplay is a nonstop adrenaline rush as you vie to dominate the poor saps (or the no-lifer!) who got matched with you.  Knowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 10x the price for access to this experience.  Very entertaining, very addictive.  I foresee this game being a part of my cycle for decades to come.  13/10			"

								I read over and over and over that people give a game ""Addictive"" reviews. I try them and sure, they're fun, they get me hooked, but usually, after the first few hours (2 or 3 if I've made it that far into the game) i begin to get bored. This happens especially if the game is of a new genre to me. NOT THIS GAME. On average I play maybe... 3 or 4 hours of video games per week? I mention this to put the following into perspective... I bought this game, and precisely 48 hours after purchasing it, I already had 12.5 hours of gameplay in my record. This is the first time I've ever used the ""HIGHLY ADDICTIVE"" in any review for a game. I highly recommend it. It's fun, you can improve on how you play it, and the matchmaking is really sweet. You (generally) don't get stuck with amazingly good players. If you're in the US just dont play it during school hours (7am-1pm), you'll get matched to people outside your rank, and usually on the other side of the world, so the lag can be felt sometimes.

								Not gonna lie, this is probably the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game in a long time. Nothing beats playing with three friends over the internet, and hearing their cries of despair as you hook them and drop bombs on them. There's a good amount of maps, different game variations, and now an xp system for you to unlock stuff as you progress through the game. There's also a story mode, if you're into that kinda thing. Overall, 8.5/10 would spend 80+ hours playing again.			"

												Alright, SpeedRunners is a fast-paced racing game that looks nothing like (and plays nothing like) a normal racing game. It blends elements from platformers and other genres seamlessly... kind of.The game has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs, but it's been improved considerable since I first reviewed this game and it's a much closer to flawless.There's a lot of glitches that I originally complained about, and I think the dev's edits and fixes to them has been phenomenol and deserves it's own mention. There's still a few issues, mostly with lag, but that's hardly a fixable issue due to poor ISP's and everything.That being said, the game is still an amazing game. I would play this 24/7 if it didn't have it's road bumps (and, as you can see, I've still played it religiously). From what I've seen, the ""Story"" mode is mainly bug-free, and if you can't handle the lag from online players, you can always play with AI and friends in a custom lobby. There's a built-in  solution for every issue I have found, so in reality, by the end of this, a LOT of people might be saying ""SpeedRunners is an amazing game and you're wrong!"" and I'd agree, especially since it's much more tolerable than other games *cough* Monstrum *hacking*, and it runs at a very smooth framerate for a game of this size and quality (most games I can't play in a resolution above 800x600. This game I certainly can).Finally, I say buy this game for 3 main reasons: it has surpassed many MANY more games on the steam store, it's no longer Early Access, and it's an amazing game already. who wouldn't want to race their friends in a cartoon world of a guy in a unicorn suit, a cat, and a detective dog? I certainly do.			"

								SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty diffrent and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.			"

 SPEEDRUNNERS REVIEW   Speedrunners  is an extemely fun 4-player party game. The game has you racing your opponents through many different stages and your goal is to off-screen the other players to get a point. If you get 3 points in a match then you win.  Speedrunners  has extremely fast-paced gameplay that is so god damn fun, and is a game you have to play with friends to get the full enjoyment out of it, like Super Mario Kart, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros, etc. The game is a 2D platformer, so I'm going to instantly recommend the use of a controller, because the keyboard is way too annoying to use. Speedrunners  like many other party games, contains many different items that you can use to get the upperhand in a match. You get experience points from successfully using the items and you can level up to unlock more characters and skins for those characters. The game  does have a somewhat lack-luster soundtrack. With it as a whole, getting extremely repetitive at times. To be honest this is a flaw, but most of the time you will not notice this if you are talking to friends over Skype and when  things get really intense. Visually  the game is very simplistic. There are solid colors throughout the whole game, but it actually adds to the charm of the game in my opinion and doesn't detract from the overall experience of the game. This actually makes Speedrunners a perfect game for low-end rigs, so that is always a plus.  RUNNING AGAINST THE ONLY 3 FRIENDS YOU HAVE IN A SPEEDY WAY. 9.8/10  "

								Speedrunners, a game of reflexes and grapple hooking your friends.You really should get this game, honestly. It's definitely worth the friend rage. Also, the only issue I have right now would be the blast zone lines aren't transparent, which they should REALLY do. Analysis:Speedrunners is a game of running around a big map, grapple hooking your way to first place. Of course, it's only possible to grapple white ceilings, so the majority (unless allowed) of the map is going to be running, picking up item boxes, and trying to get to first place. What you have to do is make sure you keep on running til you can't. By that time you've hopefully won your first round. The game is in Early Access right now, but it's getting a lot better! The controls are also configurable and it's really best with a controller.The items while not that plentiful are actually really fun regardless. You have rockets to shoot at people, EMP blasts to destroy: grapples, golden grapples, boxes, and also rockets; invincibility shield drill which protects you from harm, golden grapples which hook onto the closest player in the direction you face, and 3 boxes.Speedrunners also has a nice twist to it where you can choose different modes to play. The most frustratingly fun has to be the mirrored track mode. Rapture just shoots rockets everywhere, lethal spikes, all X (X being either rockets or golden grapples last time I checked), and there may or may not be another I'm forgetting at the moment, but that's the fun of this game.tl;dr Speedrunners is a REALLY fun friend rage-inducing game that makes you want to keep trying to aim for the top, but also can be played casually enough for fun.I'd give this amazing Mario Kart-esque game a 9/10.

								This is a great side stroller type game. It's based around fast movement and tight controls, think of early SNES era games like Mario World.The game has a lot of potential, the only **major** thing currently holding it back is faulty netcode and lack of dedicated servers (currently P2P only).Hopefully this changes as the game grows, the only minor problem I had with the game is the camera can be a bit buggy. It doesn't always stay with where your character is.If it wasn't for the netcode issues I would give the game a 9 / 10, but It will have to settle for a 6/10 until this issue is resolved.			"

								SpeedRunners is an action platformer that pits you against your opponents in a 4 player race! The aim of the game is to outrun your opponents by forcing them to fall off-screen. There are also items, switches and a few other mechanics that assist in your run. There are various different maps to choose from, including a level editor that allows people to share and play custom levels.Let's start with the gameplay. SpeedRunners is very enjoyable to play, especially with a group of friends. You'll be racing each other for hours; running, dashing, sliding, grapling, and whatever you can do to retain your lead position. Although it is fun, the gameplay is a little bit repetitive with the same goal all the time. However, the level editor does nullify some of this repetitiveness, as well as the random wheel thing that rarely spawns and altars gameplay for that round.In terms of graphics, this is the main area where the game is being let down the most. The textures themselves are a solid effort, but the particle systems are lacking a lot. The game could use some more particle effects to polish it. Yes, it is still in Beta, and polishing is usually left till last, but it is still valid for the current version. I do hope they improve this when the game is out of Beta.Overall, a solid effort still in the works. I hope to see something spectatular with this when it is out of Beta. I cannot write a full review just yet, and the rating will have to wait.			"

Early Access Review
								For anyone that hasn't caught on, this is a racing game. You race either 3 other people or bots, depending on what you are doing, and gain points which go towards your rank and gain another set of points which goes towards your level. You have a couple of options when playing as you can play 'Ranked Match', 'Quick Match', 'Custom Match', 'Local Party' and finally 'Tutorial'. Ranked Match - The only (As far as I'm aware) mode where you gain points which go towards your rank but if you lose the match you will lose points based on their rank, if you won any of the possible games and so on. In this you also gain points which go to your level. You will be put with players based on a similar rank as you and if that's not possible you will then be placed with people on a rank lower or higher than yours by one and if that's not available then it will go to two ranks. In this mode you will also have Lethal Spikes where the spikes automatically kill you (This and Custom are the only modes which have this though Custom CAN have this if the Wheel of fate lands on it) Quick Match - In this, you wont gain points which go towards your rank but you will gain points for your level. You have the same system when it comes to placing you with people. Other than that there isn't much to this mode, though this mode is good for training on some of the basic skills or learning the basic maps. Custom Match - It's pretty obvious what this mode is about, though in this mode you can invite your friends to play with you instead of random people, you can also have bots in it and you can set their level of difficulty which ranges from easy to hard. In this mode you can also set up a wheel of fate this will mod your game or the current match/map depending on what the wheel of fate lands on. The options are called 'SpeedRapture' 'SuperSpeed' 'SpeedHookers' 'srennuRdeepS' 'No Items' 'Lethal Spikes' 'RocketRunners'Tutorial - You will play against bots who are set to the easy difficulty and along with that you will have text on the map which will tell you where to jump, slide, grapple and such. Local Party - Never really used this so I'm not going to go into this one.Also to add on, the wheel of fate has a chance of appearing in Quick Match and Ranked Match randomly. So i explained you the gamemodes other than one, so why did I recommend this game? Well, it has simple graphics, simple controls though they can take time to get used to (Recommended to not change them as it only gets complicated if you do and they are quite easy to get used to),  has some competitiveness though it depends on who you are playing with, and this game easily consumes time if you ever need to just waste your time away. Now I'm going to move onto the negatives of this game as I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything. Camera Angles, this is one of the most frustrating things especially on custom maps which I absolutely despise. You're in first running, but wait suddenly the camera angle glitches or changes and you can't see anything! What can you do? Blindly guess where the next grapple, powerup, boxes, spikes and ect are gonna be! As the camera usually focuses on the second player than the first which gives them a chance to catch up as you struggle to regain your speed. Another con of this game is the picking map system, you and two other players wanted Silo? Oh wait the fourth player picked Theme Park! SO we're going to play that!  This doesn't happen often but when it does, it's simply frustrating especially when the map they picked is one you hate. One of the big things is also not really the developers fault but it's the players. Say you got in a match and you start beating them there will be a guy or a girl who will get really mean and nasty to you, calling you noob, hacker, cheater and all sorts of things because they are mad that you are dominating. There is of course a mute button but do you really have time when you are mid way in a match? I don't think so.For anyone interested the levels does nothing for you other than give you new characters or different themes of the characters and also some powerups or some of the fate of wheel things? I never really paid attention so i can't say. You start at level 6 which gives you all the basic characters and their themes and you make your way up to level 24 which is currently the highest and the character which you get at that is a golden Unic.

												Updating my review in line with release to be much more comprehensive, I'm going to use the spoiler format thing again since if people just want a quick look at one aspect of a review it should be easier to find than a wall of text, there's bound to be a better format but meh, it will do.Rating: Look at my time it's kind of irrelevant what I say at this stage, right?Overview of gameplay: High speed elimination based race, up to 4 players compete to travel through maps as possible using a combination of a traditional double jump mechanic and a grappling hook mechanic. Game also has weapons which can be used to mess up your opponents.Some gameplay tags: Very Fast-paced, High skill cap, simple mechanics, repetetive, addictiveRecommended Audience (my opinion):1. Groups of friends looking for an easy game to pick up and have fun with (probably wont pass 30 hours gameplay if in this group)2. People who want a competetive multiplay platforming/racing experience3. Anyone (Seriously it's a damn good game, I'm far too lazy to write a review like this for most games :DPros:Easy to get into I highly recommend learning the game initially with friends who are also new to the game, the start of the game has alot of just learning maps and can be very rough unfortunately if you are not partnered with friends/other newbies, even a few hours could give someone a massively unfair advantage over a new player and hurt the experience for them.Very FunFast PacedHigh Skill CapLive Update: New content / bugfixes regularly implementedCustomisable graphics (Trails, characters and object mods)Not very resource intensivePro-active Developers  This is a very important point, the devs of this game are constantly looking for feedback and, while I might personally disagree with some of their choices and initiatives, I think they deserve massive praise for their approach to the development. They listen to the community and always try to look out both for the experienced players and the newer players.....I just happen not to be in sync with the community on several discussions hence the disagreements. Streaming and community content on front-page:  Not a big deal but just a nice touch, if you release a good video or guide you might be featured on the front page after the game opens and if you stream the game there is a tab which will show your league, your current viewers and give an easy link to your stream, just a nice little touchCons:Heavily repetetive:  It's basically a racing game with, imo, slightly mechanics and weapons, there's 35ish? tracks at the time of release that are curated or official and gameplay off of these is rare unless you personally go looking for itRanked System: (Due for an overhaul according to devs, will update this review if it is updated and improved)Extremely simple mechanics: This is both a pro and a con, on the one hand it makes the game much better for picking up and playing, on the other hand it often feels like levels are all played the same, the techniques used for speed rarely vary and weapons provide most the varietySpeed Cap: This won't affect your gameplay for a very long time after you start but if you go for long enough this becomes a big issue. You take routes or do tricks that should give more speed but still everyone ends up travelling the same speed making route variation pointless and suboptimal Other comments:Soundtrack is only ok, not necessarily a con but worth mentioningDoesn't handle latency amazingly well but vastly improved on this issue so no longer worthy of a con, I have no major issues even though I can't get wired net where I live.Player count is currently a bit low which prevents the implementation of certain gameplay refinements that I think the devs would like to put in but this shouldn't put you off buying the game, games are always available and community is (mostly) nice			"

Fortunetly the menu shows some great tutorial videos for these purposes.Overall this is a great game if you are looking for an online competitive oriented game. I wouldnt recommend it for the story mode because its really short and theres no real story to the game to be honest. Its definitely worth it for the countless hours you can play in online.			"

Early Access Review
								As a silver leaguer with 282 hours logged, I feel that I can make this review both informed and fair. This is not a positive rating, fair notice.SpeedRunners is a game in which a stage is selected, and using speed and items you try to outrun your opponets. Easy to pick-up, quick tutorial, and will get you in a ranked match will players of your own skill level. This is done through a point system which is distributed by your position when only one person on the screen is left on the screen alive three times. Sounds easy and fun, right? Learning the controls and movements, sliding, bouncing off walls, grappling off ceilings. jumping are very easily learned. And Item knowledge comes at a very natural rate. The curve for player skill is impressive up until bronze, but that will be brought up later. Overall for, what I am calling, the first part the game is rather enjoyable with much motivation to continue to get better. And not to mention that you race against 3 other people. and you can set up various custom games and invite your friends to race along with you. Much fun, much merriment. Well geez, you're probably wondering, how is this a negative review when everything up until now has been so upbeat and balanced? That's just it, it's highschool and college roping you in with the concept of what their 'perfect' class should be. And we ALL know that it never is, and all you can do is pray that they don't do a complete 180 before you can change out of that class.Beginning of this game, great, fun, ignorant bliss. Get to bronze league and beyond, this game is a completely a different beast than the kitty you once knew. You'll see people that are at least 100 times better than you, and I can say this from personal experience. I bought a second account just to use as a smurf, so that I could train and be their equals and instead of coming in last place every game. But there are more bronze leaguers now so it may be a bit lighter than when I was first playing, but this leads to my next game killer. The God-Abhorrent-Game killing-Making me uninstall this game 4 times due to frustation lag. Did you knock the person off the screen and they are still going? Did you get hooked, but you were sliding (negates hook)? Did you hit someone with the 'cheese ball' but it went right through them? Did you place boxes down, but the opponet went right through them as well? Did you grapple on a platform and were sent flying in the opposite direction instead? Can you not hold the lead because your opponet is sooooo off the screen that they should have lost for 20 seconds now? If you have experienced any of these problems, you may be the victim of someone's (**Cough Lucas from Venmo/Pam Beesly looking directly at your laggy Butt**cough) lag. Call 1-800-Unresponsive Devs that will never fix these problems, quite literally. Why do you think I waited until I was silver league to review this game? So that my account/record would be sufficient enough so that it could withstand the straw man of ""They're working on it, or just give it a little time, or it will be fixed in the next update."" LOL XD, I joked about a possible theory that there were no true updates, and they just update bugs, and it seemed I was correct for the most part. Once R34 came out, that was when new  bugs were approaching!!! I noticed the opposite swing glitch, curl-up into ball glitch, and now a completely odd dead stop in air glitch on the map silo that wasn't even there before. I have given them plenty of time to address these bugs, and they have failed to give me any hope of restoration.(Not to mention of the 11 maps you can play in ranked SpeedRunners, 4 of them have been labeled as taboo by Bronze and upper classes for focusing on Randomly generated numbers=op items, and some that are just completely broken altogether. But no, let's change Theme Park again, k? K.)You will find good pings up till expert league, but bronze is where it starts to get iffy. Did I mention that to get to Bronze you need 6000 points, and for winning a game the highest point amount you recieve for beating your own rank is 30?!! I'm sorry am I at Chuckie Cheese, or playing a speed parkour video game? In Silver is the worst it can get, and that is where I am currently stuck at, and the motivation for writing this piece. The amount of people with bad pings at this level overtakes the good 8-1, matches aint fun. Especially at that difficulty and the need for pinpoint precision.I don't want to keep dragging on like I have done now, but I want to make a closing statement. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL A STATEMENT IS MADE REGARDING THIS GAME MOVING TO A SERVER. Oh did I forget to mention that too? My b. No server for your 10 bucks, p2p allllll the way. Hell, pardon my tongue, if you want to buy an outstanding title, get SHOVEL KNIGHT. 15 bucks, Retro throwback, no lag, original content for days, and amazing interactive gameplay.TLDR: This game is a poopy butt, does not get anywhere near close to a tenouttaten. I would rate it 7 asses and 5 guys outa ten. If you do not want to rage, torture yourself, or just generally like yourself DO NOT buy this game, ESPECIALLY early access. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it. Have a wonderful day! =)			"

												SpeedRunners is one of the games that can be proud that it broke the early access curse and was fully released not too long ago. SpeedRunners at least in my eyes is one of the most fun games I've played in recent memory. The thrill of being in first and the feeling that you can't be stopped by your opponents is just purely amazing and I think everyone needs to experience it.In the story mode of SpeedRunners you play as Speedrunner and you try to become the best by overthrowing the other speedrunners. But enough about the story, let's get into the gameplay: The entire game is based on speed. You try to outrun all your opponents and the last one alive wins, win three times and you win the game. Anything goes, you can use weapons,grapling hooks, explosives and all sorts of stuff. Some stuff can backfire on you so be careful on how you use the power ups.The Graphics are awesome and I love the art style. Everything from animations, backgrounds and characters, everything looks amazing.The soundtrack at first, I liked, but it get's tiresome really fast and I just really prefer to either mute the game and put on something else or just don't wear headphones.The main campaign took me 1 hour to finish, and there is some replay value. You can go through the campaign more than a few times and unlock more stuff like maps and characters. I didn't encounter any issues while running this game and I highly doubt anyone will too, so you are good to go.Overall I don't have anything bad to say about SpeedRunners. It's an amazing game and I highly suggest you check it out and you will get sucked into it. Pros:+Great gameplay+Outstanding Art Style+Outstanding multiplayer Cons:-Incredibly short campaignFinal Rating:9/10If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about it.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												This game is literally all I play now. SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game with up to four players where you choose and unlock all sorts of comical characters to play as. Racing on foot has never been this fun. Wait, it's never been fun... Well, this Makes it fun! You can play this game both casually with friends, and competitively with anyone. Learning the physics of this game and it's crazy tricks raises the skill ceiling so much higher! You can play ranked with people of your skill level, or jump into a quick match and have just as much fun grappling and kicking off walls to your leisure. There's even a single player story mode, with unlockable comic book chapters! Not to mention, this game's soundtrack and art style makes it feel all the more like you're inside a comic book! While many players buy this game on sale and give up early, this game is most definitely not dead, and seeing its success and competitive scene, won't ever die. This game is simple fun for absolutely anyone! Grapple far and hit slopes hard, runners! This game is amazing, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes any sort of platformer game!			"

			SpeedRunners is a 4 player competitive racing, running, platformer developed by DoubleDutch Games. This is uploaded at 1440p (upscaled from 1080p) for best visual fidelity.		

Textual summary:The summary can never compare to the full video, so i always recommend watching that for the best possible impression of the title.First things first: The game is a TON of fun, which is as always, the most important part of a game. The fast paced and hectic nature coupled with the various items that throw a curve ball at the players means that it's unpredictable and a great way to spend time with friends.On the competitive side the various leagues are set up quite well and while the lower leagues might have some issues with smurfs, I've found them to be less of an issue than they appear. As with all competitive games, knowing the tracks and timing are often the most important part of a game and provide a barrier to entry to those new.Thankfully, the game offers a variety of ways to practice from Bot and Solo runs as well as non-ranked mode quick matches. All in all the game provides quite a few tools outside of the ranked play to both learn as well as enjoy the game.One criticism i have for the title is that it REALLY doesn't like you fiddling with alt-tab and options. while recording the review i experienced several crashes. Theses never occur during normal play, but it's still worth noting.Other than that i have nothing but the greatest of recommendations for this title. It's quick, easy to pick up and understand and a absolute BLAST to play.  "

Easy to Play, Hard to SpeedRunI received a key from the developers (tinyBuild). As with all reviews, my opinion is not affected by this.SpeedRunners is a simple and fun multiplayer game that presents itself with frustrating matchmaking, but incredibly fun mechanics and well-designed maps!Pros:Simple but complex mechanics and physics that all players can grasp and eventually master!Levels have a quantity = quality system where all of the levels perfectly adapt and use the mechanics.Items are fair and require a fair amount of strategy to properly use.Local Multiplayer is always fantastic!Decent Workshop tools!Runs on lower-end software!Nitpicks:The Ranking System is unfair and doesn’t count ranks by the number of wins/loses.The music is decent, but there aren’t as many tracks, making it all sound repetitive.Resolution should be configured at the start/before you open the game for the first time, because the window might be too large for you to adjust upon opening it.Cons:Single-Player content is ultimately lackluster.Matchmaking needs considerable improvement, as it struggles to find players your rank easily and will end up matching you with higher-leveled people. The ReviewSpeedRunners’ main hook is it’s emphasis on competitive skill. It emphasizes map memorization, a good understanding of the game’s momentum, and effectively using/dodging items in order to win. It stays as a comfortable party game while also being something that those seeking high-level play can pick up.

And this is what really makes SpeedRunners a really fun game to play. It’s mechanics are all well-built, with it being meticulously designed to be easy to pick-up but hard to master. Items can be used to get yourself an edge if you use it right, and the maps are designed so the multiple paths don’t always favor towards players picking the shortcut. The level design, while simple, is incredibly effective. And there’s a lot of these high-quality, well-designed maps in the game. It’s the case where Quantity = Quality.The game’s mainly built on its multiplayer, which is definitely good fun. When playing with friends locally, it was a blast, and almost no issues were had with the game’s overall performance. Online Play is a bit unstable, but still playable. For some reason, getting matched up with players your own skill is incredibly difficult, and this is when you’re not being matched with players two leagues above you and literally playing from the other half of the continent. Unfortunately, the game’s matchmaking is quite problematic, although it’s nothing that they can’t fix over-time.

Another problem I have with the game’s Ranked Play is it’s ranking system. It has the old Rocket League points system that I really hate where you’re almost eternally stuck to the bottom rank due to ranking up requiring such a high number of points.The game’s single-player content is sorta just there. There’s a story mode that’s really uninteresting unless you want to unlock in-game comics, but the bots are fairly well-designed for single-player and you’ll be able to practice alone if you wish. It’s a OK offering for a mainly multiplayer-only experience.The Custom Level Editor/Trail Editor are nice additions, and certainly help bring another side of the community together. For the most part, the tools presented are already good enough for players who want to design levels or make cosmetic trails, and this is apparent due to a lot of the Workshop maps being well-designed.The game’s presentation is relatively decent. The art-style is nice, but the UI is a bit messy. The game’s soundtrack is repetitive due to it being only a handful of in-game tracks, but it’s definitely well-composed and invokes the excitement that comes to the game’s matches.

It can run alright on lower-end hardware too, so you don’t have to break the bank to get it to work. However, I noticed considerable framedips on my lower-end laptop when playing it, and when the game got anywhere below 50 FPS, it was practically unplayable.For the most part despite the technical issues I’ve had with SpeedRunners, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. There’s some real potential for a brand new competitive e-sport, but on it’s own, it’s fantastic fun with friends. If only the Online Multiplayer wasn’t quite the mess.TL;DR - SpeedRunners is a well-designed game that’s sure to take a spot at LAN Parties, despite it’s bad matchmaking and minimal single-player content.For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!Be sure to check out the rest of my reviews for LOG on OpenCritic @ http://opencritic.com/outlet/380/lots-o-giveaways "

												This is a fantastic platformer racing game.  I invested in this game back when it was in early access and it was worth it even back then.  The multiplayer racing is really fun.  Since then they have also added new characters, new levels, new skins, and a singleplayer storymode which can be used to practice before you get into the PVP.  It's a good thing too because jumping right into online multiplayer can be discouraging since the people still playing this game are very talented.  All of the characters are pretty original and the short discourse before each race is just enough to give a good sense of each characters personality before racing to your/their death.  But the thing that makes this game is the fast paced grapling hooking, item throwing, boost using racing where you have to keep up with the fastest person otherwise you go boom.  It goes with a number of games which are easy to understand, but difficult to master (In a good way).  It's a lot of fun to play with friends and it makes for very exciting and intense multiplayer experiences.			"

""Youtuber packs"" will undoubtedly date itself. Many older levels have been memorized, exploited and gamed to the point of being impossible to enjoy with habitual players. Such is the existence of a racing game where the leading players control the speed.WORTH: If you don't have many friends on your list that own this, you may not have as much fun with it.OVERALL: Not many titles can say that they single-handedly revived a persons trust in the words ""Early Access.""SCORE:9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

								Speedrunners: Gotta go fastDo you like racing games like Mario Kart, 1950’s esque artwork, superheroes, well designed video games, and having fun? Well, my friend, then SpeedRunners is for you!Because it’s all of those things wrapped into one really well made package.SpeedRunners is a racing game, first and foremost. The setup being that various superheroes are racing to the scene of a crime, or emergency, and trying to beat each other there! At least that’s what I got out of it, the game is light on story; but it honestly doesn’t need it, the gameplay is what shines here. And boy, let me tell you, it really shines. This game is polished. It’s incredibly smooth, responsive, and just feels good. Like peeling the plastic off of a new cellphone.And surprisingly, SpeedRunners is an Early Access game! It’s still in Beta! I continuously find myself being shocked at just how good this game handles. It feels like a full fledged release, and I give the developers, DoubleDutch Games, credit because SpeedRunners is fantastic. This is in part because of the wonderful ‘track’ designs present here. A good racing game is crippled if it doesn’t have fun courses, which SpeedRunners delivers on. There are twelve or so levels, and only two that I dislike. That’s a pretty successful margin.Now, unlike any other racing game I have played, SpeedRunners involves… running! Who would have thought, right?And despite being a foot race, SpeedRunners maintains an excellent sense of speed. Four players all running at breakneck speeds trying to usurp each other. Throwing missiles, freeze-rays, hooks, and crates left and right hoping to trip each other up. The highs are high, and the lows are looooow. Being in first place, getting hit by a missile, tumbling around and ending up in last place-- and then dead-- is jarring. You’ll get mad at your friends. But when you do it, it’s oh so sweet.Each race is an elimination race where each ‘lap’ continues on until only one runner remains. Other players are eliminated by advancing far enough ahead that the edge of the screen touches someone. Then they explode, are out of the race, and the screen’s border progressively closes in until it’s just a tiny rectangle big enough for two players. This requires you to memorize the tracks very well, because at that point you’re almost literally playing blind.It gets real intense real fast.As with most multiplayer games, SpeedRunners is best with friends. But the game also offers some really, really, good bots that actually offer a decent challenge. And it has a very active multiplayer! I’ve never not found a game, which is great… Although I have occasionally run into some particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥-y people… But it is the internet so that’s to be expected.I beat another player using the hook, this game’s equivalent of the ‘blue shell’, and he promptly told me in all caps to leave the game and engage in sexual congress with myself. I called him out on this, and he told me I was being rude for using the item. I proceeded to handle this situation quite poorly. But that’s another story!Internet antics aside, SpeedRunners is fantastic and certainly one of my favorite games of 2015. Even if it came out in 2013. 2013’s 2015 racing game of the year.SpeedRunners is just a joy to play. Even alone. And for $15 it’s a total steal. There is tons of content in this game, with like a billion different Runners and like ten skins for each one. They also have workshop support so that the community can create levels… Sadly I have only played a few workshop levels that even come close to the amazing quality of the developer courses.I will wholeheartedly recommend SpeedRunners to anyone looking for a cool local co-op game. Or, hell, anyone looking for a competitive racing game.It’s that good.Seriously, go buy it. These guys deserve the support.Like this review? Check out more at 100hoursave.com.			"

								Speedrunners is a very great game for competitive players or friends trying to have fun. Surprisingly, this game doesnt ruin as many friendships as you think. The gameplay is fun, and the youtuber packs are really cool. If you have any friends at all,    play with them, seriously, it is awesome. Although this game is too buggy to give it a great score, i give it an 81/100			"

								I've given up on this game. I first played during a free play weekend and was thrilled! So much fun! Then I got it in a Humble Bundle and the fun was already fading away.Even in the Entry League, players are very good and you have to know the levels very well to have a good chance. I made it twice into Beginner League, only to be demoted very soon after that. In almost every lobby there is someone who should be at least two leagues higher and wins the match with 3 wins and all others having zero. Balanced lobbies are very rare, I'd say one in twenty.And now that I started to know my way around the official levels, everyone is selecting workshop levels and the ""fun"" is starting all over again. The levels are so much harder and pure frustration for the ""Beginner"" I seem to be in this game.This is my biggest problem with this game: The difficulty curve is so steep, you can barely get better. If you get matched with better players, which is very likely when you start playing this game, you have almost no chance to get to know the level. And if you don't want to spend multiple hours per day to learn the levels in private lobbies, you're lost.When I play 10 games per day, only one or two are fun. The rest is frustration either due to much better players in my lobby that don't leave me any chance or workshop levels that are so much more difficult than the already difficult official levels that I spend most of the time waiting for the next round.It is a shame, because I really started to like this game. But it has changed so much that it became a source of frustration and anger, rather than enjoyment.P.S.: The community is basically the same. You do meet very nice people, helping you, explaining moves, levels, etc. But more often then that, you meet elitists that don't give a damn about you being a beginner and struggeling with the game.

								Speedrunners is one of the most addicting games I've ever played and it's very rewarding when you spend time learning all of the tricks and strategies for each map. The game also has a ton of replayability since there are so many great user maps and you can always make your own if you'refeeling creative! I really hadn't played any videogames (consistantly) for several years and this one has kept me occupied for the past 22 months or so! Highly recommended to anyone that likes competetive games with some really cool mechanics! :)			"

								I'm enjoying this game so far.  As other reviews put it, it's like Mario Kart on foot, with the powerup-induced laughs and frustrations that brings.  I think it's reasonably well paced, once you work your way up the brisk learning curve: deaths are annoying, but I almost never felt like it was unearned.  Good twitch gameplay.The aesthetic of the game is fun too.  A good homage to lighter campy-style superhero cartoons, in visual and audio.It's still in beta, so it can have its bugs from time to time, and they may tweak the balance at some point.  But I had fun playing it, and you might too.			"

								tl:drScore: 7/10Pros:- smooth and colourful- easy to learn but challenging to master- cheap- still being improved- quick matches make sit easy to fit in schedulesCons:- lacks content still- will start to get repetitive- no real reason to play rankedSpeed runners is an indie developed, 2D sidescrolling, racing game that is fit for all ages due to its unique appearance, availability and 'quick to pick-up' controls. This combined with its fast paced gameplay and short game length allows it to be played anywhere and anytime (i myself am guilty of sneaking it in and about while doing homework and assignments,""just 1 more match!"") which can explain its overwhelmingly positive feedback even while it is still in 'Beta' development. Included with this gameplay is the intergration of the ranking system which involves the use of the leaderboard which tracks players in you league and how many points they have which allows the player to check their standings compared to others which allows for a competitive environment that increase the games longegevity and also seperates casual players to more serious ones.Speed runners appearance is fit for all ages due to its bright and bold colour palette which distinguishes the background from the runners that the players control, giving the game a 'quirky' and fun feeling. Its availability comes from its low price of 10 dollars while not on sale and 2 dollars while on sale which is a cheap price compared to most other games in the market that usually range from 15 to 25 dollars. Speed runners is also a 'quick to pick-up' game letting players get into the game faster and also making it less daunting for newer players to the genre. This combined with its cheap price and colourful appearance sets this game up for long-term success due to its wide target market and the fact that cartoons are better than realism long-term due to realism always being outdated while cartoons itself are a unique and personalize genre of presentation.Its rank system involves the use of leagues which are different groups that players are placed in due to their skill. Its uses a point system which is the way you rank up to a higher league in Speed Runners in which points are earned according to you succes in matches. However you may ask how they balance out the points lost or gained if you in a match with higher ranked people? Speed Runners makes it so that if your vsing a higher ranked person, the points you lose in the match are decreased and if you vsing a lower rank person, the points you lose are increased. This, combined with the quick matches that speed runners offer makes the ranking environment, friendly and less daunting for any player. There are the reasons why Speed Runners in my opinion is worthy of a 7/10 rating which can be improved through increased content, different styles of gameplay e.g. new gamemodes, perhaps a unique character customisation (might be going a bit too far xD) and general bug fixes which i strongly believe will be achieved when this game is out on full release (maybe not the character customization).

  (WARNING) First (serious) review of a game for me  Alright, this game is really great! Don't get me wrong when I say I dislike some aspects of it..The maps are innovative and require a lot of learning in order to be competetive. But learning the map and the game without friends playing with you in a custom game can be really hard when these semi-pro people just dunk you in few secs every time you queue in a non-custom game. Guess it can also be reviewed as a plus that its skill cap is really high. Almost rogue like, for some players.I might have over-exaggerated the 'pros' of the games you encounter solo, but the only way  I  truly enjoy this past the initial excitement (~1 hour in my case) is with real friends, not random people. Think it as a Super Smash Brawl game. Social fun is where this game is at.  As it is for the ranked system I can't say, it's not been available while I've been playing (during steam winter holiday sale 2014). I give it  4/5  ..for fulfilling the graphical and mechanic-wise aspect.  Having workshop availability where you can add your own created maps is also a plus increasing the amount of different maps available. Only reason I'm deducting one point  (NOTE, things might change as game leaves early access) is for shortness and how quickly it becomes repetitive. I'm missing the lack of different game modes. But with friends at equal skill levels it's one of the most enjoyable experiences on steam. That is, until you get all the achievements and play it till boredom without anything new to experience. Then it's time to switch game, and that can't be blamed on the game. Totally worth the minimalistic sum of money I had to spend for this game. Also one of those exceptions, when it comes to buying early access games for me.  Thank you for your attention.  "

												This game is fun but there is a catch.... It all started when my group of friends started playing this together. We thought it would be fun but it has brought us farther apart than we have ever been. I am currently down 3 monitors and 2 headsets. My friend is down a DX racer and a monitor and my olther friend is down nothing because he wins every single match and ruins everything for us. Good game if you visiting your friends with a bat after each session,  but if not, do not buy it.			"

But there are so many alternative ways where you can go to be faster. Good game to watch videos nextby. The Power-Ups are just amazing! The only thing that I dislike are the characters, which I think could look a bit cooler. Also I have some minor lags sometimes (once in an hour), which is quite weird, because my pc is a lot over the requirements.Cool local-co-up game!

								Despite a lot of the glitches and other variety of issues I've had with this game (if I or another person I'm playing with lags for a split second it's like game over with how badly everything will glitch across the screen/getting randomly stuck in walls/etc etc), it is an immense amount of fun and definitely worth the money. It's a ton more fun to play with other people, especially your friends. On the upside though, 8/10 friendship breaker next to Mario Kart.It's occasionally offputting with its updates on the maps, and usually the workshop levels have way more to be improved upon (for the most part they aren't worth playing in my opinion). Most of the changes on the maps so far are pretty good and add a bit more variety to the game play.Playing a lot of ranked doesn't feel like a chore, both due to just how the game runs and that the community is pretty laid back about the game as well.

								Run, jump, sprint and swing your way around thousands of levels while staying on screen or getting eliminated. Launch missiles at your opponents, flatten them with giant fiery boulders, freeze them with ice beams and grapple hook them like Scorpion to stay ahead. The screen begins closing in after the first elimination, and continues to work its way in until a winner is found. All four runners immediately restart the race at the last point, and the race continues.

												It's a side scrolling racer where the object isn't to finish laps ahead of your opponents, but instead only to get far enough ahead of your opponents to push them off the screen to their explosive death.  It's got a bronze/silver age comic book feel to the aesthetic.  It reminds me of the racing game included with Kirby Super Star.			"

								Upsides:FastpacedEasy to catch onGreat musicGreat character lineupDownsides:Still buggy at times, accidentially clipping a wall, getting stuck on something, etcBad ranking. Game is supposed to choose players in a match based on nearby ranking, but a lot of the time you'll just end up as a beginner against advanced rank players, or an advanced rank versus entry rankers, ETC. This is very frustrating when you're expecting someone witha bout the same playtime hours as you.Overall, still worth the buy. Especially during a sale.			"

								Very enjoyable game, great with friends! It's kind of like a racing game - but the twist is that it's 2D, and you control people instead of cars, and you get to shoot rockets, get powerups, that kind of thing! It sounds simple but it takes a while to get the hang of it, and knowing the map gives you a huge advantage in outsmarting your opponents, just like a race track there are side lanes (that are tricky to get to but can send you zooming past other people). I'm comparing it to car racing to give people a better idea, but then again it feels different and is a refreshing game to play! I'm playing with a controller and love it, they're still updating things and smoothing out bugs that I still encounter once in a while (mostly with multiplayer connection) but since I got the game it's seen substantial improvement and I'm looking forward to its release! Also thanks Tom for the hours of fun!			"

								I came into this game with low expectations, purely because my friend told me to get it without ever playing it. It was half off in the summer sale so I said why not. I prefer this game over ACU, ArmA 3, and other games I spent 60 dollars on, and I only spent 5 dollars here. I highly recommend this game to those of you who are competitive yet spirited. It's not too much money relative to a lot of other games on Steam, and it's a fun game where you can meet other people. As you rise through the leagues and ranks you become to know and race a tighter group. I've been playing this game for 6 months  and loved every second of it.			"

								What's SpeedRunners? SpeedRunners is a game that puts you in a foot race agasint two to four players.  This can range from CPU, Online And Local Players,  or if you're feeling risky adding them all into the mixture.  It gives you a range of characters to choose from and a DLC pack for all of you youtube gamer followers at a reasonable price.  Let's now talk gameplay.  Fast,  It's the only word to really describe it,  Yes that does sound overwhelming at first but that's what makes this game stand out.  You have to focus,  and it's not a button masher.  There are tips and tricks,  slides and more that you will need to look out for in order to make sure you are the last runner... running?  Upon that sometimes the normal levels can get a little bit boring,  but never worry as they have a workshop community where players and even you can make and submit your own levels and even download them to play in your game.  It never gets boring and is quite addictive.  8/10. :)			"

												Speedrunners is a fast-paced (obviously), two-dimensional, 4-player racing game with a surprisingly high skill cap and a good amount of progression.  Quick matches are around five minutes in length, which is quite a refreshing break from the 45-90 minute games of CS:GO so many of us are intent on playing every day.While it is fun, fast-paced, and cheap, it DOES have its issues...  The main mechanic of the game is a steadily decreasing screen size which bottlenecks the players' view of the map, where any player that falls out of frame is immediately killed.  The major problem is that in maps that are more vertical than horizontal, the camera does not know who to follow.  Oftentimes, players that are lower faze out a higher player or vice versa, entirely out of luck.Besides this and a few other issues (random deaths when getting too far ahead of your opponents, stuck in walls, etc), the game holds its weight fairly well for such a cheap title.  They NEED to implement a Group Queue option for ranked and quick play, though.  This game is far more fun to play with friends, and finding them in Ranked is difficult - particularly when they're a few ranks lower than you.			"

								SpeedRunners, I never thought I would enjoy this game until I actually played it. It's a high adrenaline game that always forces you to be thinking about what to do next.But this game has quite a few pros and cons.PROS:- Fun- Challenging but not too annoying- Unique Characters that aren't just a cosmetic upgrade, but are treated like a whole new person- Many ways to play, including a story mode.- The way the game is made, you can play it for a long time and it won't get old- The game is really rewarding when things start going your way.CONS:- Story mode can get a bit boring- After you have become a complete expert at the game and you don't have anyone to play with, you may want to use multiplayer, which can be laggy.- The running can get a bit repetitive after a long time.OVERALL:The game is really fun at the moment and is great, only dropped down by multiplayer and repetitivity. 8/10			"

								October the 2nd, 2015. It's free weekend for this game. I go in with a single plan: Get the achievements before the weekend is up and then get out, never to look back.At first the game seemed decent but there wasn't much to it, wreck the bots over and over again. BUT THEN! I tried a match...against living people! That is right! I'm telling you right now I went into a match with other humans behind their own computer screens. yes sir. and It was the funnest ♥♥♥♥ I have ever experienced. Let me tell you something, There's a chance my username sound familiar. That's because I lurk /b/ and I'm in over half the beg threads. I DO NOT BUY MY OWN GAMES. I don't do it. If I can get something for free, you bet your jail-bait ♥♥♥ I'm going to get it for free. So you know this game is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent when I reach into my own torn up wallet, pull out my debit card, and buy a game for myself after only playing it a few hours.If you're on the fence about buying this, get it. 10/10 would get cheek blasted by veteran players again.

EDIT AS OF 20TH APRIL 2016Well, it's finally out. Hooray!And to sweeten the deal, owners of this game from Early Access automatically get No Time To Explain Remastered, if they don't already have it. :D=================================================================EDIT AS OF 6TH APRIL 2016I finally took a look back at this game due to it releasing out of Early Access 2 weeks from this edit, and I gotta say wow, they've really improved a lot since the last time I checked in (date in my edit below). There's new music (the old one was nice but repetitive after a while) and new sound effects, they've put the local party mode into the game, and there's going to be a story mode too!But the thing that I was clamouring for the most in my initial review? It's FINALLY HERE!If the game had any option for setting search parameters to half the world by default (or maybe even the whole world, since I never even saw that), that would be great.And indeed, to my joy, they did. They've now added the option to specify which region to search for matches. THANK YOU!Also, the character trail shop is now live. I think this works particularly well - none of the trails, as far as I know, improve your character, and are mainly for cosmetic effect, so this isn't pay to win. Another nifty idea to generate more revenue after this game's been bundled quite a lot of times already. (But, as reported[tinybuild.com], it has helped to boost the online community so well.)I'll leave my old review as it was, just note that it is partially (with respect to the matchmaking) outdated. I have however increased my EA rating, and this only makes this game much easier for me to recommend now.=================================================================EDIT AS OF 19TH AUGUST 2015 After changing Steam's download region, a method which enabled me to find online multiplayer matches in another game, I was able to join a match nearly-instantaneously. A VERY odd workaround - I shouldn't have to do this to even begin with, but at least I was finally able to find matches. ================================================================A fresh and vibrant concept that marries platforming and racing in an almost seamless manner.It took me a while to really try SpeedRunners, and that was on a whim after watching several Youtubers and Twitch streamers play the game. It seemed like really great fun to play with some friends, and it proved to be as such.Another gem published by tinyBuild games (wow, they're really starting to make a name for themselves in the world of publishing) and developed by DoubleDutch games (I checked, they are based in the Netherlands, hence their name...LOL), SpeedRunners tells the story of up to 4 superheroes all racing and sabotaging each other in order to get to crimes the fastest. (And yet, the funny thing is that every map is basically all the runners going in a loop without actually getting to a crime scene...)The game does seem like it needs more polish, despite the great concept here at play. Once in a while I get the occasional game crash, sometimes I find (oddly) that the game doesn't respond to my controls, there are a few weird bugs here and there where I am eliminated from a round a lot earlier than expected......but all these pale in comparison to the fact that online matchmaking for me is incredibly annoying and almost always fruitless. Being on the other side of the world as compared to most people doesn't really help, since the matchmaking starts from your continent, and only switches to half the world after an increase in 2 leagues. Seriously, how many leagues does this thing have? I actually searched up to 23 leagues in half the world once before I threw in the towel. I don't even know why I searched that high either - I'm a novice! If the game had any option for setting search parameters to half the world by default (or maybe even the whole world, since I never even saw that), that would be great. Refer to my edits at the top of this review.Otherwise, the core elements of this game are incredibly great. There are a wide variety of powerups to frustrate your opponents with and slow them down or pull them back. Not that many official maps but there is a theoretically infinite supply with in-built Steam Workshop support. If you can grab a few friends to play a few rounds of multiplayer, you're probably going to have a fun time. (Or you might end up becoming ex-friends with those friends. It can swing either way.)If you don't have any friends to play with, and/or cannot be bothered to play online with other people, you can actually practice your skills using bots. There's also a single player ""Origins"" mode where you have to reach a goal within a certain amount of time. This has been replaced with a new story mode where you race bots. Very decent alternatives that are adequately able to account for any lack of real life hoomanz.Now if only they will do something about the matchmaking, I could probably play this for a lot more time yet.When to buy The game has been bundled a few times; the cheapest it has gone is 75% off. Quite worth picking it up from these sources/at these prices, it's great. :)9.0/10This game was previously demoed on the Who's Gaming Now?! Twitch Channel[www.twitch.tv]. We regularly demo indie games on the channel, consider tossing us a follow. "

Run, jump, swing around, and use devious weapons and pick-ups to knock opponents off-screen! One of the most competitive games you'll ever play.""  good description.  Has Bots too, who are very good players.  Side scroller with Comicbook looking graphics.  Hard to master.  Many maps.  Runs but was set odd on my screen.  The campaign game was a bit glichy, keyboard kept losing movement keys, has to restart map often. Has Steam achievements and trading cards, controller support.Played on Free Play weekend.

												Speedrunners is a fast paced online parkour-platformer with 21 different characters.Nowadays its pretty difficult for beginners because there are very many good players which already played the game for hundreds of hours and there arent many new players.Four players have to try to shake off each other by running faster than the others.Items which you can grab:-Speedboost   (limited amout)-Hook   (to get one place ahead)-Bomb (slows the ones  behind you down)-droppable crates (slows the ones  behind you down)-Freeze way (freezes the ones in front or behind you for a short amount of time)-Shockwave (pushes everyone away from you)(great if you want to listen to music while youre playing a game because there arent any relevant sounds) :DRating: 10/10			"

								While Speedrunner started life as a successful flash-based browser game, having currently been played well over 8 million times, it gathered more attention when it was released on Xbox live Indie Games in the summer of 2011. Since then, it has been critically acclaimed for its tight controls and exhilarating local multiplayer mode, receiving high review scores and the Indie Game Magazine award for Best Xbox Live Indie Game of the Year 2011.Well, now it’s time for Speedrunner to take on PC’s biggest platform and prove itself as one of the best multiplayer platformers out there. Listening to feedback from players and critics, DoubleDutch Games have taken their time to improve the game by offering over twice as much content, an advanced leaderboards and matchmaking system and  a much-requested online multiplayer, allowing players to show off their grappling hook skills against friends and foes around the world.In short, SpeedRunners is a 4 player competitive platformer with grappling hooks, power-ups, and interactive environments. Run, jump, swing around, fire rockets, grapple onto people to knock them off screen to prove you are faster than them!			"

 An Excellent Fast Paced Platformer!The concept of this game is very simple to grasp, outrun your opponents off the screen and don't get eliminated by falling behind. However for such a simple concept this game has a fair bit of depth with many levels to play through. What's more is that there are many levels that have been created by the community that you can play through the steam workshop, and you can create your own level if you wish and submit it too. This is a great game for playing with friends, as it caters for a fun and casual experience if you wish, or as my group discovered hours into playing the game, a very quiet experience where everyones concentration levels are through the rooof trying to time each and every jump,slide, grapple, and powerup perfectly. There are also modifiers to the rules available so that you can choose what weapons are available in your game.This game is a must buy as there are certainly many laughs to be had, and friendships to be destoyed (just like in mario kart) :D			"

It is worth every god damn penny of those $10. You want my opinion buy it and message me so we can play together. You will be loved by another person (which is me) if you buy this gorgeous stunning godly game.			"

												SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.			"

								A game simply amazing at what it does, running, and with immense speed. It raised my competitive spirit to an all-time high with the ranked online mode, which encourages you to beat other players of same skill, attain points, and rank up! Playing with friends is a blast and mostly just hilarious. I have barely touched the time trial-esque singleplayer mode, though, only because the multiplayer is just so fun to play and so difficult to put down. Just don't slam your controller at the screen because of the professionals that'll surely beat you everytime.                                                                           10/10			"

								Great fast-paced game. The use of power ups allows for even gameplay and has similarities to the Worms franchise, Mario Kart, and parkour related games.The most fun thing in this game is to be able to grapple yourself around on those white edges, and double jumping. Or what about jumping up those dotted walls? There's a lot of fun little features that will make you fall in love with this game.Would like more personalised characters instead of the preset ones, or just more colour variables on the existing ones.Best played with friends!

								Fun multiplayer Speedrunning game for up to 4 players.  Gotta go fast like Sanic, right? Yep indeed you do!  It's a highly competitive game.If you play with people that are much higher rank than you, just do it.  Don't rage.  You will learn the tricks quite a LOT faster than you would playing with people the same rank as you!  With enough practise, you'll be ace.You may find that people say it's impossible to play with over 80 ping, but it IS possible!  You just need to time some things earlier & predict where they're going to be.Recent update made it harder to find lobbies (playing with 200 ping isn't that bad, come on).  It's when a ping is unstable which ruins the play.This screenshot was taken when the US/UK/Europe people would still be awake.


Broadening search to 169 leagues above or below your rank.

Change the Download Region in Steam to get around this. Or add ""+search_distance worldwide"" to the launch options.Fun fact about unstable pings:  The game is more likely to break, and can be quite hilarious sometimes.  See this video if you would like to get an idea of what I mean:

								This game would make Gabe get off the couch and start running.Okay, seriously now. This game is amazing, it actually is somehow addicting, I like it so much, it is fun when you play with friends. Especially when you encounter them in a league match and start beating them, ;). I don't find anything wrong with this game except for some bugs that you encounter rarely, I believe. I encountered some of them it wasn't really hard playing the game with them tho. There are two Downloadable Content packs.The 1st one is called 'YouTuber Pack 1'It contains the following characters;1) Markiplier2) Peanut Butter Gamer3) UberHaxorNova4) Jesse CoxThe 2nd one is obviously called 'YouTuber Pack 2'It contains the following characters;1) PewDiePie2) Strippin'3) CinammonToastKen4) DodgerIf you would like to have fun, get to know new friends etc. this game is good for that. So, conclusion;I fully recommend this game. It's pretty amazing, go ahead buy it and have fun with your friends!			"

								SpeedRunners is a race game in which you have to leave your opponents off-screen 3 times in order to win.

												Fast-paced racing game unlike any of you have seen before. Instead of cars, the game is a symbolic representation of how some gamers blast through a game without fully enjoying it. However, you actually enjoy it in this game! You play as one of numerous speed-bent characters with Steam-exclusive editions such as TF2's Scout and Payday 2's Wolf in a thriving array of maps as you race against other players and/or bots to eliminate your competitiors by getting them off of the screen while staying in the lead. There are numerous items and gameplay mechanics that can help you achieve that, such as a grappling hook, C4s, homing missles, freeze rays, wall-jumping, fireballs and more! The story is told through unlockable comics and each character has its own purpose in the game as well as multiple skins to stand out in the crowd. The game has a multiplayer mode, ranked mode, and allows you to easily play with your friends. The game is purely skill-based and while you can spend real-money, you can only acquire cosmetic speed trails that have no effect on your character's performance. If you are looking for a way to pass-time in a thrilling yet entertaining way, this is the game for you!			"

												This game is really great. The amount of optimization you can have on a map is insane. Just when you think you've hit the best possible strategy and timing, someone else comes along and rips that dream from you and you're forced to take it back. In 18 hours I never reached the most optimized run. I was great but there was always someone who was better and that is a very good thing.I haven't played the game for a year but in the time I spent with it there were no negatives.			"

								A fast-paced racing game that tests your timing and skills, as SpeedRunners is very crazy (in an awesome way!). Got both Youtuber packs as I don't see much competition about them xD (they are all awesome in their own unique ways).What I think of the game so far is:PROS:- Get more DLC Character Packs! (I quite enjoyed buying them and putting it in the collection!)- Custom Games are good for training for future online games.- Origins makes a good decent Single Player Campaign.- Markiplier and PewDiePie. Need I say more???CONS:- Certain lag spikes happens at certain times.- No functionality on the pause menu on Origins.- Has a chance to crash when you want to even up the screen size.- Why is Strippin' wearing a princess outfit?! WHY?!? O_OI will update this once I discover more PROS and CONS.			"

								Just a quick recommendation before this short review begins: play this with friends. Trust me. It's very fun.SpeedRunners is a very fast-paced fun little game which keeps you on your toes. There are 10 characters you can pick from so far, including a pink unicorn, a Soviet spaceman and a scout from a certain game (I'm looking at you, TF2).As it is still in early access, more characters and stages are likely to appear. And, if you can't wait long for new stages, build your own in the level editor. For $10, I'd say buying this would be worth the risk. "

								Before I begin, I want to say that I have watched this game develop hugely from the beginning of 2014.Now, SpeedRunners is a fast paced racing/platformer game which relys heavily on map memory. The game itself is simple, but trying to master it is another question. I've played just over 260 hours, which is a fair amount of time I assume, and have found that the game has developed amazinly since 2014 and quite frankly I am shocked how many people now play it. Whether it be through youtubers or humble bundle the SpeedRunners developers are very friendly. From hosting tournaments where the winner gets special perks in-game to creating a level designer to the game which adds so much more depth to the game. This game will always be one of those games where I go ""Gosh, don't you remember SpeedRunners. What a great game.""I love this game and will keep playing for a long time.			"

								This is a highly addictive game, with a simple, yet effective concept. It combines repetitivity with creativity and simplicity (I won't ity much, I promise) in such a way that I keep returning. Admittedly, when it comes to online play, I'm not very good, but I constantly strive to improve, and it is that which makes the game addicitive and how the combination mentioned above is so effective.EXTRA (23.06.14): With the inclusion of the 4 new characters, and with those the new animations, this game has gone from comic book style to comic book HD (that made sense in my head).I guess I'll finish this with a simple rundown. The basic review shenanigans.Graphic: 9/10Simple and clean, reflecting the comic book style.Sound: 8/10I wish there were more songs, but what there is is nicely made. Also, the female characters sound male when hit :/Length: n/aIt's a game about going as fast as you can. There's an origin mode, but it's mainly for online play.Fun: 10/10Addictive. After this, I'm off to play more XDTotal: 9/10, highly recommended.			"

								The game is a small, yet super fun indie game. I've played it for about 4.3 hours in about one day. It's essentially a running, 2D platformer with Mario Kart-like elements (one where you use a missile that homes on the lead player, similar to the dreaded Spiny Shell!). I'm a Mario Kart fan and a Mario platformer fan, so a hybrid of my two favorite games is a big delight. Despite its simplicity and how easy it is to pick up, there's plenty of strategy behind this, especially concerning item use, as all items have their own perks and strategies. The only downside personally is that I'm required to play online to unlock some characters and costumes, as it stops leveling up after a certain point, and I don't like playing with randoms online. I played offline with my twin, and we had a total blast with the game. Hopefully, mods will get bigger with the game, as it's also fairly easy to mod some aspects of it, including the music.			"

								At the time of writing, this game is still in early access so bear that in mind when considering the purchase if relevant!Speed Runners is an incredibly fun and competitive platforming racing game. Each match can have up to four players and throughout levels you can pick up power-ups to either gain an advantage or to screw others over by using the golden hook or by dropping a load of crates down in front of them. I love the art style personally and the levels are pretty well designed and the user created levels are equally as good! One problem that I do sometimes experience however is network problems, namely lag when I'm spectating a match after being eliminated but also whilst participating. But, it is to be expected as this is an Early Access title. To be honest you can't really go wrong especially for the price.			"

However nothing is perfect, the soundtrack to this game while catchy at first does become quite annoying, since it's pretty much the same song in a constant loop.

Graphics settings are a little disappointing, however this really isn't that big of an issue for a title like this since the game is pretty easy to run.

An amazing original idea which works incredibly well. i would definatly recomand it to anyone that is looking for somthing new play or just to play in your spare time either way its a great buy.

												This is another one of my favorite games of all time and I have been playing it since the xbox 360 days. Destroying your friends has never been more satisfying. Also has a friendly community, (not at all toxic) which is a nice change from LoL. With its' full release the game has never been in a better state and I love all the new features it has brought to the table. Would recommend this game to anyone even if this isn't near their taste of gaming. Also all of the workshop content that users make keeps the game very fresh because original maps can get old eventually. Personal rating has to be 9/10 for its' amount of fresh content, trail making, fair pricing, the amount of fun with friends, and replay-ability the game has. (Speedrunners 2, please?!?) Love the game guy!			"

								It's fun, quick-paced action, simply to achieve a certain goal which is to win or wreck other players with mini power-ups. It's like Mario Kart on a 2D sidescroller game on just one main screen.I like how this is a quick-paced game where you can absolutely enjoy this with your friends (internet friends included) or your family.This is also a great game for killing time, having fun, or play serious as it has competitive ranked matches.So far, I haven't encountered any bugs, glitches or crashes. Will update this review after any update is released from this game.I do hope this can provide more seeing as they will also release this game as free to play but restricted access to online play.

Lots of laughs and fun times (and extreme rage!) to be had while playing this game. Here are some great features of the game:+Great for playing with friends+Addicting gameplay+Custom colours for your character+Constant flow of awesome updates and content+Awesome gadgets and power-ups at your disposalDownsides to the game:-Bugs yet to be fixed (this applies to any game, really)-Screen freezes-Occasional connection issues with hostOverall:Addicting and fun game to play with friends, and awesome community and updates.

								This game is in beta right now, but I have really high hopes for this. A racing platformer game. So simple, yet so damned fun. You race three other people through a course, with powerups, and boosts, switches, shortcuts, and more. The game is pretty basic right now, but oh god is it fun. I've played a few rounds with my friend, and we had a great time. The singleplayer part is okay, just kinda helps you refine your skills. Playing MP with other people is a blast. The bots are kind of broken, however. When my friend and I played, we saw the bots going in the wrong direction once. It's still buggy, which is to be expected from a beta, but this game is fantastic. Looking forward to the full thing.			"

								Ahh. Speedrunners: the death of us all or as I like to call it, The Friendship Destroyer. Introduction and anecdotes!Yes, that's right this game is overwhelmingly competitive and would spark rage into your opponents as you all battle it out on 13 official maps and a variety of workshop maps that are being made everyday by the community via their very own level editor! What do you mean, ""the friendship destroyer""?Well then my friend, let's just say that continuously blowing them up with rockets and bombs (two of the many item pick ups in the game) didn't really appeal to them as much... Turns out they must've un-installed the game or something... Shame really I would've loved to hear the sweet sound of keyboard smashing :( But in all seriousness, this game is fun, exciting and unpredictable. Full of intense 1 on 1 situations as the death border comes closing in on you and your rivals masking the map behind it relying on your knowledge of the map to guide your superhero player in the right direction...Speedrunners is a very easy game to get into..... or should I say, get addicted to; wanting to win just one more game or to just get that final few points to rank up to the next league it's definitely hours worth spending...When you first open speedrunnersThe game puts you straight into a tutorial as soon as you load it in teaching you the basics of speedrunners and the controls you're using to jump, slide and swing and all the other jazz such as using your pick-ups... This means that new players will pick up the game quickly and will be soon off to get to their dream league...How long I've been playing and what to expect from ranked:I've been playing for at least 74 hours now (in total aha, as addicting as this game is I don't think I'd do 74 hours in one session :P) and I've managed to get up to expert league and I'm in the top 10 in getting to the bronze league... Which is harder than you'd think... The higher league you go the more advanced players will be and the more skilled they will be too. More experienced players would know the best routes and would be quick on their feet to secure their wins using all tactics built up from previous experiences and knowledge built up over time.This amps up the competitiveness of the game and draws you in. Tips, tricks and routes:As you do this, you tend to pick up on some of the tricks other advanced players use and you'll notice tips such as saving your boost and being sure to hit those angle blocks to gain more momentum and speed.. It will be vital that you learn new routes too for the individual maps as going certain routes will be faster than others and some may be more advantageous than others too such as getting into the VIP Area on Nightclub, A tricky route to learn at first (how to get there) but getting there or not can be a great game changer and would definitely score you some easy rounds IF your opponents don't manage to get there.AdditionalThe artwork/visuals and mechanics of the game are very good and look very pretty (you won't get bored of it too easily is what I mean) and it's being updated constantly; this includes layouts, new characters being added and even secret characters which you'd have to do some digging around to find out how to get them ;) and many more. The animations for all the characters are great and are unique to suit their design and style and they are all fun to play with. Some characters have different skins such as the main Speedrunner can be blue, white, yellow or black for example so you can personalise your favourite characters to suit you..ConclusionI would totally recommend this game for anybody who is competitive and/or wants to have heaps of fun in one single session. There are a few bugs scattered around the place which is reasonable for an early access game but with an amazing community and an active team they're being fixed regularly thanks to the wonderful community reporting them and requesting ideas or changes to the game that are always considered by the developers to make the game ready for launch.And for a game only worth £6.99 It's definitely worth it!OutroThank you for taking the time to read through my horribly structured reviewIf you would like to play sometime then don't be shy to add my steam and let me know you came from this review! :)-Syrunner (/Cloaker is MINE!)

The controls, graphics, gameplay mechanics, power-ups, characters, music and levels all contribute to making this a very great game.I hope that with time the developers continue to iron out all the bugs and continue to add great material!

								Highly addictive and extremely fun, competitive gameplay with friends. There's so much tension in those epic showdowns with your buddies, BUT it doesn't have that frustration that for example trading card games have. However, I don't really think it's worth 15 bucks... that's so much money I could get drunk with it. Get it on a sale			"

								Of all the games I bought during the holiday sale, this is by far the most fun.  With most popular games only getting more complicated, SpeedRunners is pure, simple enjoyment from the the word ""Go!"".  An excellent game to play between more serious games, especially with friends.			"

								A fun game to say the least with alot of laughs and a great selction of character customization great power ups and maps.But there is one flaw, when 4 people are in a game and 1 isn't ready no one can start at all which annoys the hell outta everyone so I would really like a votekick button to get the player who is stalling outta the server.

												Originally bought SpeedRunners on sale for the Payday 2 collaboration masks. Skeptical at first, I decided to play it and now I have barely played Payday 2 since.SpeedRunners is a fantastic side scrolling 2-D racer, in which practice and strategy are key to keeping up. You have to push the limits of speed and discover unique ways to use the course to your advantage. If you watch high ranked players on live stream, holy crap. The focus and determination is incredible. SpeedRunners community is pretty chill and it's fun working on skills and showing them off against people.One of my favorite games and will continue to come back to it.			"

								Played SpeedRunners for a free weekend, out of the 2 days I played, I spent about 5 hours. I love the game, it's addicting, and fun, fast paced, and keeps you moving. Great graphics, gameplay, music and sound effects, and the controls are great, even using a keyboard, although a controller would probably work better. My only issue, and this is a big flaw, finding a game online, sometimes you will sit in the lobby for up to 25 minutes. Other then that, this is a must buy!			"

								Okay... gue edit lagi dengan menggunakan bahasa Indonesia.SKOR: 9 dari 10.Wait, serius lo Wing?Kesan pertama: ini adalah game platformer tentang balap lari. So, lo dengan 3 orang lo berlomba lari menuju.... nope, tidak ada garis finish. Menariknya adalah ada buanya tantangan disetiap map, mulai dari duri, jurang, angin, dan sebagainya. Belum lagi kalau player lain memberikan roket, menarik lo, atau mengebom lo. Iya, ini semacam lomba lari tetapi juga survival. Grafik: Kartun sederhana. Bukan berarti sederhana lalu jelek. Justru game seperti ini sebaiknya memang pantas dengan grafik kartun yang sederhana. Tujuannya adalah agar bisa dimainkan disemua tipe PC. Walau pun begitu, Dev nya termasuk Dev yang rajin dan terus mengembangkan animasi dan berbagai macam bug yang ada di game.Gameplay: ADDICTED! Serius game ini itu bener bener dibuat untuk main bareng dengan temen lo. Bayangin lo dan 3 orang temen lo saling tarik menarik, saling membuang roket, atau saling meledakan bom sambil berlari menuju lingkarang yang gak ada batasnya. Eh siapa bilang gampang? Justru dalam waktu kurang dari 1 menit lo tau tau berada dipaling belakang, keluar dari 'layar' dan akhirnya kalah. Game ini mungkin waktu pertama kali agak susah untuk dimainkan, tapi semakin lama lo memainkan, lo semakin teradaptasi dengan map nya, senjatanya, turbo, dan berbagai macam rintangan lain.Storyline: Biasa aja. Story line disini menurut gue bagaikan practice ground. Jadi sebelum lo head-to-head dengan teman lo, ada baiknya lo memainkan story line sendiri agar 'lenjeh' dengan gerakan gerakan yang ada didalam game. Gue berani kasih skor 9 dari 10.Kenapa? karena developernya rajin update, gameplaynya addictive, grafiknya sederhana tapi menarik, dan terdapat steamwork sehingga lo gak bosan untuk memainkannya lagi dan lagi.

								People in other reviews say that it is like Mario Karts with legs, and they'd be right, when you're low skill.Now this isn't to insult anyone who's new to playing the game, but when you've learnt all the mechanics, unlike mario karts there is a way to counter every single item you come across, only sometimes would you need another item to counter. Also unlike mario karts, items are not the largest part about it. There are 4 things that make you go fast 1: those boats that give you boost which you can use at any time 2: the bubbles that are in some parts of levels 3: If you have alot of velocity downward and you grapple you get alot of horizontal velocity 4: Same applies with number 3 but with slopes(stairs included) that are in the level.3 & 4 is where I say that high-skilled players are separated from the low-skill that makes it unlike mario karts. Because most people who are new to the game don't know this(you should probably add it somewhere in the tutorial devs, or choose a different level that demonstrates these 2 well).  Anyways, these 2 important mechanics are what most of the useful tricks in speedrunners are basically derived from, it basicallys makes up the speed in speedrunners. Its these 2 mechanics that make it fairly different from mario kart, because in mario kart, without the items its basically who knows the map's parts and who's learned which kart is best to use and how to do the turns well(which isn't very in depth).That's what I wanted to say about how this game is not mario karts. This game is extremely fun and very competitive. I've been playing it for at least a few hours every day. I've put 229.5 hours into this game, just the last 2 weeks I've put 21.9 hours(which is more than what other people writing these reviews as of now have even ever played).Sometimes speedrunners is buggy, and perhaps it could use some more maps, but this game is top-notch, no doubt about it.the characters also amuse me. 10/10.

								I'm really loving the game so far, and at this price could already recommend it to anyone.Edit (19-9-15): As of the last update, most of my concerns aren't valid anymore. Though I haven't had the chance to play a lot, I noticed a variety of music tracks got added, and the game hasn't crashed since. The only issue I still have with the game is the fact that it can at times be hard to find a match, especially during off-hours. Hopefully this will improve in the future. Other than that, it's still a great game.Positive:-a lot of fun, and fairly original gameplay-a lot of variety in characters, though this doesn't really affect gameplay (which I suppose is yet another good thing)-the game seems quite polished in the sense that most things seem to work as intended, and there are a lot of things that make you go 'oh yeah, good idea' while playing (though, of course, I can't think of any now)-multiplayer works rather well, though it can take a minute to find a game, which I'm guessing will improve as the player base grows-ranked matches-pretty cool community so far. Seen some rage quits, but no proper moaning/swearing as of now-community made content (just maps as far as I can tell, but who knows)Negave:-the game occasionally crashes for me (haven't yet looked up whether more people have this, but I'm guessing they do). This doesn't happen frequently enough to be a major issue, as restarting and loading the game doesn't take much, but it still sucks when you happen to be in a ranked match or with a nice bunch of people-the music gets rather repetitive, which isn't that big a deal. It would be nice if the music selection had some more variety at some pointAll considered, I'd really recommend it to anyone who enjoys the idea of a side-scrolling racer (runner...) which had me actually laughing out loud at times.

Started it to get the Steamcards and was bored enough to try it meanwhile... and got hooked. Played through the whole single player-part and had a blast failing hard in multiplayer. Absolutely worth a try - also for people normally not into this kind of games (In that case get it when u find it for a really nice price).The 2 missing Kittens are angry on the following points:- no real Tutorial- to long waiting for not rated matchesHope they will fix this before release and throw in some catnip - so the 2 can come back.

												A good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!Speed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The gameplay itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters. More or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few). Levels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design. Visuals are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game. Sounds are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices. Overall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!Indie Rating : 7.6/10EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.95/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  C+PS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?

								SpeedRunners is an interesting hybrid between Sonic the Hedgehog, Ninja Gaiden, the Batman: Arkham games, and Mario Kart... which is to say it's a hectic mess of crazy fun.Oftentimes, the game becomes so insanely fast that you can't tell what's going on, but it never becomes frustrating or annoying.After one opponent is left in the dust (off screen), it sets off an explosion that begins to shrink the field of view, which makes long matches intense.As you try to outwit, outrun, and outluck your opponents, you can gain weapons with various effects (a homing missile that chases down nearby foes, a claw that yanks your opponent out of place and flings you ahead, a freeze ray, etc.). These can all be used brilliantly to mess up your opponents (or occasionally yourself if you're unfortunate).There's also your typical boosts, and the excellent grappling hook to help even the odds when you're falling behind, which adds even more to the fun.The graphics are simplistic but fitting. It's well animated, and has a very clean look. The downside is, when someone is far behind, the screen zooms out and makes it somewhat hard to see, or when the match has lasted for a great amount of time, it can be a bit difficult to see what's ahead as the screen closes in. However, this isn't a huge detriment.The audio sounds good and fitting, except the music is very repetitious. There's only one song while racing, and while it's catchy, it does grow old after a while.The vanilla stages are well designed, and have well placed shortcuts and traps, and have a very well placed risk-versus-reward-style layout for each one. The Workshop also provides random stages, which have varying levels of quality (naturally).Simply put, this game has a few flaws, but it's a blast, especially with a group of friends. It's a perfect example of a party game.			"

								Seriously addicting multiplayer-game. One of the best on Steam, both online and local. I would recommend playing with a controller though, as it's much simpler and easier to learn than mouse and keyboard. Mechanics and controls are smooth and extremely satisfying to pull of when you've gotten good at the swinging and the momentum based gameplay. Makes for some intense battles and salt between friends.Single-player is forgetable, but serve as good training, but even that's stretching it.Dosen't take away from the game, it's just not a single-player type of game.

												I seriously looked at this game a while ago and thought it wouldn't be interesting. A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person ""dies"" by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.			"

								I played this game with a friend at PAX PRIME 2014 and had a blast trying it out with other people in the room. I purchased it soon after the convention and was pretty sad to see few players online and bots that got stuck often. Now a year later, they have made great improvements to the game including a great matching system based on rank, better bots, and have fixed some of the more disruptive bugs. It's a fun game to pick up and play anytime.			"

Really fun couch multiplayer game - I cannot stress this enough. We have played alot of this, and certainly will play alot more. It plays waaay more fun than it looks, trust me on this.Pros:+Plenty of little control details that rewards knowledge of the play system (i.e. sliding will dodge the golden hook - there are lots of little details like this)+Lots of levels, plus Steam Workshop+Awesome ranking system for online playCons:-Music is meh-Graphical/art style is meh IMO-DLC is not worth it - although I bought it to support the devsThe Pros far outweigh the Cons. Pick this up for some local fun and you will not be dissapointed. "

								I really enjoy the game, yet I think the presentation and overall DESIGN (not the gameplay) is somewhat unpolished. The music is excellent and uplifting, yet I'd prefer at least 10 more tracks to the overall package.Right now, the design, personally, it feels more of a potpourri of singular good choices, that however don't really want to fit together as a whole:-> The stage design is very ""clean"" and sterile of some sort, yet the characters and overall design is aimed to be quirky?-> The music ranges from upbeat funk to Ska (please add more ;D!) and fits the quirky design, yet clashes with the sterile stage design, and even with some meaner looking characters-> the red ""borders"" when one player died are just ugly to look at - how about some fire animation of some sort, to actually ""see"" the danger?-> character design is highly (!) uneven in quality and ""charme""-> German translation is amateurish. It seems like somebody posted the stuff on google translate. And I'm not even kidding. English wordplay and puns are translated 1:1 and is REALLY wonky in german.-> I'd like to see instant emoticons or ""taunts"" in gameplay. Just add another button ingame for ""well done"" ""haha"" or ""lucker!"" :D Chatting while playing is nearly impossible - so why not allow ingame-taunting and ingame-feedback :)The gameplay however is very much fun, and I recommend you playing it! :o)Right now, in Beta R44 : 8/10 (With high potential up!)

But seriously, great game to sit down and have a play, it's quite addicting when you have a passion for reflex games like this and I love the way there is a ranking system so it puts you with people within your rank, or you can just play a quick match with a group of interesting people. Very well made and much love for this game.			"

												I seriously looked at this game a while ago and thought it wouldn't be interesting. A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person ""dies"" by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.			"

								Seriously addicting multiplayer-game. One of the best on Steam, both online and local. I would recommend playing with a controller though, as it's much simpler and easier to learn than mouse and keyboard. Mechanics and controls are smooth and extremely satisfying to pull of when you've gotten good at the swinging and the momentum based gameplay. Makes for some intense battles and salt between friends.Single-player is forgetable, but serve as good training, but even that's stretching it.Dosen't take away from the game, it's just not a single-player type of game.

												So i'm only silver league but i've been playing this game for nearly 2 years and heres my honest opinion:I have always loved this game and it was such an exiting, enjoyable and competative experience. But since its released most of the few good Australian players stopped playing, or at least arent as active as they used to. This makes at least in my case very difficult to find a game at all. Let alone being evenly matched.Gameplay whise this game opens up so much room for skill developement and the constant strive to be the best. With the limited singleplayer replay value this pushes most players to the online area of Speedrunners. Online can be very pleasant and fun to play whether it be playing with some old mates or making new ones by yourself everyone on there seems to be mature and friendly.As the online connection is P2P (No servers), one person with faulty internet can pretty much ruin the experience of everyone else as it breaks the game most the time and you end up frozen in a game.Recently with the games release they have introduced trails for people to buy with microtransactions, this really felt out of place with the whole arcade style of the game and I have rarely seen people using them.Alltogether this is quite an amazing fun to play game, I reccomend buying a 4 pack and gifting it around as it is best played with friends!

												This is that kind of game that you buy not to write a review or to get achievements, but to have fun. If you bought this game to write a review, you probably already forgot it and have a few hundred hours now. It's absolutely an immersive experience - it is simple, fast(depending on your skill... or luck), fun and interesting. I don't know any similar games to this and it is indeed how they describe it themselves. It is really interesting to play with better players and get knowledge from them, while also it's really cool to teach some. And apart those two things, then there's insane fun when lots of unintended things happen, where you could accidentally win by insane luck against a pro.I have it since the early stages of the game, been watching it even since it was r2x or so. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, at the start it might be confusing, but with time it gets only better. It is fast, and you get a hook. And items. I think that is fun enough to do insane s*** haha.GraphicsWell, its obviously not a realistic 3d real life game. Personally I love the art style and the design. It's a really nice style, an open style I would say. The animations are really nice, plus the taunts. Wonderful. The animations at times is like a type of communication between players, and it is interesting for how many expressions a single taunt can be used.Fancy styleGood animationsGreat tauntsStoryWell, it just got there not a long time ago. But it is not what you're buying this game for haha. It is what will probably introduce you to the game as a new player, and for a new player the unfair difficulty can be really unfair.Short storyRather newbie-friendly, but good introduction to the game mechanics as a storyVery easy for early access players.
Sound(track)The sounds in the game are really well done, the soundtrack is amazeballs. it's really fun to play listening to it and it gives you lots of fun. Great sounds(grapple, swing, items)Fancy and fun soundtrackA little con might be:Characters do not talk or suchOverall, yes, this game is worth every cent it is sold for. It gives you all the features you need to have a great time and to get hooked to spend a million hours of playing. If you see it on a discount, grab it immediately.			"

												This is a fast paced insanely fun game with a great art style (reminiscent of the movie Incredibles) and a fun soundtrack. The beginning of SpeedRunners is a bit problematic for example it took me a while to figure out how to change the controls. And the story is only useful because of the new characters you can get, but the dialogue is painfully cliche. It's obvious that this is truly a great game but I would only recommend getting it if you have someone else to play with. PDHD gives this game a 7/10. Fun.			"

												This game needs to die!It takes up too much of my time generally early in the morning when I should be sleeping.Other than that which isn't that bad I'd recommend getting this game it's a really fun game.The controls were interesting at first (""Z"" to jump???) but as I kept playing they just fit.I'd recommend the tutorial first then play story mode befor you jump into quick match.Also if you can't find a Quick Match go into custom add yourself (add Local) then add a bot and make the other two slots Add Online so that you can play and others can join through a quick match.I liked this games graphics and the way the play area gets smaller just adds to the competitiveness which leaves you furiously hitting buttons to get in front of your competitors to have them explode.The amount of times that bloody golden hook has stuffed me up or been used to stuff one of my enemies up.... I don't think the game would be the same without it.If you ever want to mix it up add triple rockets, they are OP and definitely evil. "

												Fantastic, competitive, fast paced fun. Easily the best use of money I've made. Swing, jump, slide, and, yes, run through a variety of original and user made levels. Use items to make your friends (or enemies) fumble, stop, and get knocked out so you may burst through the pack. In that sense it is similar to such masterpieces as Dokapon Kingdom and Mario Kart and Party, it is a fun ""friend destroyer"", Level up to get new items, maps, characters, and skins. The only problems are that it's best with friends, so you'll have to convince friends to purchase the game, or you'll have to buy the 4-pack, the story lacks, though that isn't the main focus, and that, without expansion packs, there are few characters (but the workshop makes up for that). I give it a 9/10.			"

								Lots of fun to play. It's Competitive, Addictive and Skillful.One of the best Couch Co-op games because everyone is on the same screen.Default levels can get boring after 100 hours but there are some really good Workshop levels for that.Great Community as well.

												So i'm only silver league but i've been playing this game for nearly 2 years and heres my honest opinion:I have always loved this game and it was such an exiting, enjoyable and competative experience. But since its released most of the few good Australian players stopped playing, or at least arent as active as they used to. This makes at least in my case very difficult to find a game at all. Let alone being evenly matched.Gameplay whise this game opens up so much room for skill developement and the constant strive to be the best. With the limited singleplayer replay value this pushes most players to the online area of Speedrunners. Online can be very pleasant and fun to play whether it be playing with some old mates or making new ones by yourself everyone on there seems to be mature and friendly.As the online connection is P2P (No servers), one person with faulty internet can pretty much ruin the experience of everyone else as it breaks the game most the time and you end up frozen in a game.Recently with the games release they have introduced trails for people to buy with microtransactions, this really felt out of place with the whole arcade style of the game and I have rarely seen people using them.Alltogether this is quite an amazing fun to play game, I reccomend buying a 4 pack and gifting it around as it is best played with friends!

												This is a fast paced insanely fun game with a great art style (reminiscent of the movie Incredibles) and a fun soundtrack. The beginning of SpeedRunners is a bit problematic for example it took me a while to figure out how to change the controls. And the story is only useful because of the new characters you can get, but the dialogue is painfully cliche. It's obvious that this is truly a great game but I would only recommend getting it if you have someone else to play with. PDHD gives this game a 7/10. Fun.			"

												I seriously looked at this game a while ago and thought it wouldn't be interesting. A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person ""dies"" by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.			"

								OMG what a game, I don't recommend you this game, no, I put a gun in your head  and I'm gonna shoot if you don't buy it. Is one of the best game ever. Is like, playing an old game, but, multiplayer, online, and competitive, is like... I don't know, play Mario or Megaman with a friend who is in another country, but both are competing who beat the level faster. Let's make it clear, you don't shoot, you dont jump in enemies, you just run and throw items and usea some kind of nitro, but it have that old retro controller just like Super Meat Boy. I'm happy with this game and I know is gonna be free when it will be released, but, you have to pay for it, trust me (and of course, when the game goes free you will not have multiplayer online ♥♥♥♥).9.9/10(There is no 10 points game never in my life)			"

								Speedrunners is easily one of my favorite multiplayer games. Think 'Mario Kart if it was a platformer' or 'Smash Bros if it was a racing game'. The gameplay is super addictive once you get a handle on the controls (supposedly it's easier with a gamepad/controller, but I like the keyboard controls fine), and the community is pretty nice for the most part. My advice for new players would be to try out the origins mode in addition to the tutorial: it allows for instruction/practice on individual game mechanics as well giving some backstory on the game (even if it's pretty basic).The workshop is super cool too. It's really interesting getting to see the creative and challenging level designs made by other players.			"

								So, you've heard about this game and you question yourself should you buy it. But, you don't like 2D games because they have shi*ty graphics and are really boring. So you decide not to buy it. Soon you get bored because you've been playing some better games, which are 3D and have much better graphics. But then, you see this review. You know no one would spend half an hour writing a shi*ty review for a shi*ty game. So you realize that this must be a great game. Congrats, you bought it. And now you're addicted. Can't stop playing. Your life is ruined so you decite to sue the developers for ruining you life. You lost at the court and everyone thinks you're insane, so they send you to jail to prevent you from killing someone because you're too desparate. But, you don't care because they gave you a PC with SpeedRunners installed to keep you calm.This review was probably too long, but I don't care and I have one more thing to say: Sorry for my bad english  "

As other reviews have pointed out it is a lot like Mario Kart in that you pickup weapons along the way that you can use to get ahead of your oppoents, except it's a side scroller with levels that can twist and turn and be as dangerous as the other players!It's still in Early Access so there are still some bugs but hopefully these should be ironed out for when it's released officially :)If you enjoy Mario Kart, side scrollers and like to play with friends, this is definitely a game for you.

								SpeedRunners was an unexpected gem for me, this game is super fun! the game is hard to describe, I basically racing on foot with all sorts of tools to use to hinder your opponents or help yourself get into first place.  You can only win by knocking your opponents out of bounds on the map, otherwise you just do laps until the first player dies, after this the playable area on the map will slowly shrink until there is only one player remaining.  There are a large amount of playable characters, and even secret bonus characters like the payday crew, goat from goat simulator, or even a potato, just a potato.  Couple the unlockable characters with the unlockable colour schemes and you have huge variety. It even gets better with user created maps! There is a lot of fun to be had in Speedrunners.Overall I enjoyed my time with Speedrunners over the free weekend and would recommend it to a variety of people, indie fans, racing fans, anyone who is a fan of fast paced sidescrollers.

								This game is so simple but so intense at many of times. When I first started to play this game I figured it would be just your average casual party game, (which it still is) but the longer I started to play the more intense it got. There is nothing more exciting than RUNNING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND, esp when you are having to doge rockets and boxes that are being thrown at you like a bloody prick slapping the ♥♥♥♥ outta you with a pile of rubberbands he got at the dollar sotore. The maps are very simple (not talking about the community made ones though) which is good because as the game goes on the screen will get smaller by the second, making you have to ride your opponents behind like two angry cars during rush hour on the San Diego Highway.Overall I give this game a 8/10			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only played through the story mode, but I feel like that actually captures the essene of what the game is, if not the entire spirit of it.I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow.  I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game.  Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?The game is hectic.  Chaotic.  Deliightfully retro.  There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish.  Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration.  I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too.  Probably a party.Long story short: buy it.  It's a good time, even on your own.  It only gets better from there.			"

												It's literally just a game about going ♥♥♥♥ing fast. Also has items to screw over your opponents. Has workshop support, mostly for maps. It also has plenty of maps to choose from in the vanilla game. The only negative about this game is that it puts the 1st place runner on a disadvantage, because of the way the camera works. So basically, The first place runner will have a smaller field of view than all the other runners.Edit: also, you get lots of skins throughout the game as you level up. They're really cool. I think they're 70% of the things that make me keep playing the game, to be honest.			"

								So, you've heard about this game and you question yourself should you buy it. But, you don't like 2D games because they have shi*ty graphics and are really boring. So you decide not to buy it. Soon you get bored because you've been playing some better games, which are 3D and have much better graphics. But then, you see this review. You know no one would spend half an hour writing a shi*ty review for a shi*ty game. So you realize that this must be a great game. Congrats, you bought it. And now you're addicted. Can't stop playing. Your life is ruined so you decite to sue the developers for ruining you life. You lost at the court and everyone thinks you're insane, so they send you to jail to prevent you from killing someone because you're too desparate. But, you don't care because they gave you a PC with SpeedRunners installed to keep you calm.This review was probably too long, but I don't care and I have one more thing to say: Sorry for my bad english  "

								I really LOVED this game, i just bought it like, 4 days ago and i already have one whole day of playthrough, but as well i saw some bugs in it, and there are some that i would like to relate1º- When 1 person is entering in the start of the match sometimes the screen frozes and bugs the game.2º- Game closing itself for no reason3º- Game freezing and making me the last in a match4º- some lag bugs that can be fixed5º- also a bug with other players lag spikes causing the camera to just bugs itself and making a random person to winThere is also some other things that would be AWESOME to be added in this game, in example:1º- A race mode, with no battles, own player screen and laps to finish a level.2º- A deathmatch, with lives, and weapons to kill other players in a level3º- A sudden death mode, players will be placed in a race with a timer, and when this timer stops, the last player dies, and restart the timer till the last player stands out4º- More players for these modes i said before5º- More musics into the game cause the only one that it has gets bit boring ;3And what i would really like, Workshop customized characters, really, it would be awesome to use like, a miku as a speedrunners model, well this is just what i think, but either ways, i really love this game <3i'm also editing with stuff that i found more into the game so yee			"

								For those of you who are wondering, SpeedRunners is basically Mario Kart meets Smash Bros. The goal? Race ahead of other players using items, speedboosts, and grappling hooks until one by one your opponents fall behind, touch the edge of the screen, and die.This game is a blast both local and online, and run pretty smoothly for the most part. I do occasionally run into weird bugs where the game will randomly kill everyone, refuse to kill someone, or follow someone other than the leader, but it's never much of a problem.The single player time-trial-like mode isn't that great, but you'll probably have too much fun in the multiplayer to notice. There aren't as many items as a Mario Kart game, but most of them are pretty cool: a hook to latch on to a player in front, a bomb that can be remotely detonated, a homing missile, a drill to speed you up and make you invincible, and crates to block incoming missiles and hooks or to trip up opponents. The stages are also great, featuring hard to reach shortcuts and alternate paths that can be closed off. Also, I have to say, once you master the grappling hook, getting around the stages feels so good.			"

								The game plays awesome. Simple, yet spot on !It has a fairly steep learning curve, even after 50 hours of gameplay I can still find a faster route, or even a way to get from point A to B.It is your typical 2D chasing game with fun elements up to 4 players. Rules are simple. If you fall behind the edge of the field-of-view, you are out. There are multiple routes you can choose from,  boosts, items to pick up and use against the opposing players, and you can trip them as well. There are a handful of fixed maps to play (they just don't get boring for some reason), and also every week there are new featured workshop maps.I play it with 5 of my friends, so I would say the game has it's replayability in playing co-op with your friends, tho ranked matches provide enough fun fof quite a few hours.May the fastest win !

Early Access Review
								Where to begin with this one.. I love it. Made some custom maps (which aren't GREAT, but demonstrate my appreciation for the game) Imagine Mario Kart, but without split screens. You get power-ups and momentum from swinging around with your hook (45 degree angle, keep that in mind if you intend to play) and the point is to stay in the screen, and eventually ahead of your opponents (up to 4 player matches). When you move out of the screen, your OUT for that round.The downside is that it is in Beta (hence the early access thingy). So expect frequent reload from your desktop. Ignore if it isn't in early acess anymore. Also, for now, there is no league and so you will sometimes face very skilled opponent who won't give you any chances at all (unlike me; i will wait for you and show you the good path for a ""speedy run"" if you are new to the game). Also the music is not really varied as of now, febuary 2014 (only one track for all the stages... enjoyable at first.. but you might want to drop the music down and use your own playlist after a couple of hours.)But, again, this is a really enjoyable, very competitive racing game and you can play local co-op or online co-op or even a mix of both! >I would also recommend that you use a controller if you want to be the best, but then again I havn't really tried on mouse/keyboardPlease forgive my poor english			"

								This game will literally crash every other time you try to play it. It will baffle you with it's score mathematics at the end of a round. There will be one guy that's way better than everyone else. Nobody will ever play the custom levels for some reason. The game will randomly start another lobby on you mid match. Then it will crash when that game launches. It will be the buggiest, most annoying game you've ever played and you'll put fifty hours into it because it's addicting, stupid, and a lot of fun. Buy it and love it. Great game. I hate this game.			"

								Great game, horrible player base. I enjoyed this game for a long time up until i got to expert. First of all people want to ban part of the game, i can live with that but the real problem is that people will quit the game when they are about to lose I must have lost 500 points to dc's. The other problem is theres not that many players. It is quite rare i find another expert when i play, i usually get bronze or silver witch is way above my level so i get my ♥♥♥ kicked and it takes the fun out of it. Like i said up until expert i had lots of fun with this game and thats why i still recommend it but it has serious problems.			"

								SpeedRunners is a fast-paced, competitive and enjoyable experience especially if you're playing with friends or with other individuals around the world. What makes this game so thrilling, is that you're trying to become the best runner within the match while facing some frustrating obstacles and hazards, but the real dangers are the players within the game what makes this game so exciting and worth playing. However, if you do want to play online and go up against people with bad WI-FI signals, then that takes the fun out of the game, but I'd recommend you playing with individuals you know, but if you don't have friends pray if you find people who have good WI-FI connection while playing ranked or quick match. In the end, that's what the game is all about fast, fun and a crazy experience and I truly recommend it if you want something simple, but competitive.			"

												Speedrunners is a game where you race in a map until one person achieves 3 wins at which point the lobby chooses another map. It is played with 2-4 players and has a variety of uses. At first when I played speedrunners I got it for a fun party game as well as online play with my friends. It would be a lot of fun running, jumping, and grappling around the map as we laughed. I didn't play it much like that when I started playing Online Matchmaking. People started crushing me in speed and that's where the game took more of a competetive feel. It wasn't until I felt like I was good enough to go on Ranked, where the real fun begins. I would've never expected such a simple game to have so much depth to it. The great thing about this game is that it has a variety of aspects that all do well. It is a party game for if friends come over, it is a fun online chill-out game to have a laugh as well. Then it is more about winning in online. After online and into ranked you start in entry league and it is pretty basic. It is around when I am now expert league and I am facing bronze league's where the game really starts to show what it has to offer. Serious competition, but still about laughing and having a good time with random people you are facing. This game is for almost anyone except people who rage easily for no reason. Please don't get the game if you are that person. Nobody wants to play with that person. Actually nevermind, just don't get any game that I play. I never want to play with that person.tl;dr  The more you play, the more you discover about the game, the more you have fun. If you don't want to pay full price that is ok because if you want to support the devs more you can buy trails for .99 cents each. It's an in-game store I actually enjoy having for many reasons. Whenever you are playing, always remember that there is room to get better so don't worry!			"

								It's basically a 2D platform version of Mario cart, on crack. Pros:- Runs really well for beta- A fun party game- Great heros, skins, and levels- There aren't a bunch of annoying in-game purches - The little details are enjoyable. For example, every hero has a humorously different reaction to the traps.Cons:- A few typical beta glitches- Hard to find other players to join your games, and the bots aren't great, so it's pretty much only fun when you have friends to play with (and then it's a lot of fun).- Takes a long time to unlock things			"

								Pros:- A very fun original game- Doesn't get boring too quickly- Balanced powerups (No unfair op ones that change the game completely to your favour)- I have not encountered any bugs or map exploits- Really fun with friends (Private lobbies can be made without third party applications)Cons:- Being at first place does handicap you, as most of the time you are put at the edge of the screen without any vision for incoming obstacles. To overcome this you need to memorise the maps and where the blocks and obstacles are, which is not very fair for newcomers to the game- Ranked matches can be very toxic sometimes (Like pretty much any other game you play on ranked these days :P)Overall I think it is a very fun game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time!

												This game's controls are a little odd but they can be adjusted. The graphics are subpar and the character selection is massive and unique. When it comes to what you can do with them or how different they are from each other, it's another story. There's no special abilities or features that would convince you to play as someone else; this makes for close competition with no one person having an advantage, which can be viewed as good or bad.SpeedRunners does offer lots of gameplayer, as it boasts both an un-interesting but none the less existent singleplayer and a plentiful intense online. Simply put, SpeedRunners is an interesting spin to the racing/parkour scene with little variety, unique graphics, extreme competition, and character differences (mechanics wise) so non-existent that they're sure to make you quickly unenthuastic about their large roster.As you can tell, I have mixed reviews about SpeedRunners. If you have some money lying around and you're looking for a competitive game to play with friends, get it. But if you're looking for singleplayer content, or unique artwork, or character variety, don't get this.			"

								Really fun + awesome game! :) If your into fast-paced platfomers with action then this is the game for you! :) SpeedRunners (the name kinda gives it away) you have gotta go fast (sonic reference intended) but really, you do. If you fall behind (go off the screen as it is constantly scrolling as you run) then you will be elminated (first to win 3 games). Think its that easy to keep ahead of the pack? not necessiarly as the items may change who wins, you have items that can give you a boost (Blue rocket) and items you can throw at your opponents to get them to the back of the pack (golden hook is known for doing this and rockets can help too) there are many items in the game and they are all are great in their own way :). Many maps to choose from both Dev created and community created and many characters to choose from also (if you put /gangbeast in superchat you get to play as him in game in any colour) you can do this with the payday 2 chraracters too just by putting /Payday2  character so you can play as one of them e.g. /cloaker /wolf. The game is still in beta/early access so you can expect updates to this game (one was character commands and this new XP system) which is cool :). You may encounter some glitches but beta + very rare that i find them to be honest. The game has online and local play so this game is great for couch play too and online play :) the community is a mix really as you can get poor losers XD and players who are lke ""fair play gg"" but again, rare you'll see poor losers so don't let that put you off + bots are in this game too along with a single player origins story mode. With many modes to choose from (like ranked where you progress leagues) and custom match where you choose the rules (one being this wheel that decides your fate) you will be coming back to this game quite a lot as it is a lot of fun :) if you see it in sale or at full price (£7) its defo worth it as it also supports the devs! :) (check out the demo if your un-sure about it though :))			"

Once it's out of beta i would expect that most of the glitches have been fixed and ranked is up so that matchmaking can be better. Would definitely recommend this for people who enjoy fast paced and quick decision making like games. Sorry for being so lengthy.  "
