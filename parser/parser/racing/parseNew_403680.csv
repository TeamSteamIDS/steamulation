												As deep as it is challenging. If you're a fan of Marble Blast like I was as a kid you'll feel right at home with Dexterity Ball 3D.			"

												It's fun, challenging, and infuriating. The challenge is enough to glue you to the screen and make you want to WIN!! It really tests your hand-eye coordination.			"

												I don't think this is an early access game, but I do believe this game is unfinished or unpolished. While not an awful game, it is not one I can personally recommend. On the other hand, I do believe that people who have enjoyed similar games will enjoy this one.			"

Key provided by developer/publisher. This does not effect my review.Dexterity Ball 3D is an unconstrained, physics and skills based platform game, which can be played in three modes. There is no convoluted back story or adventure included. Your goal: collect all the gems as fast as possible. Are you ready to be challenged?!Tags: Action, Indie, Racing, Physics, Difficult, 3D platformer, Puzzle-Platformer, Singleplayer, MultiplayerList of notable featuresLevels: There are 20 unique “speed run” levels, each with a different focus. However, all of these speed run levels have the same priority: collect ALL of the gems in order to open the teleporter at the end of the level. My favorite level is #3: Yeah Magnets. It throws you into a map with platforms that have no guide rails. Situated along the map in similar locations to gems, you can find and collect magnetic power ups which allow you to stick to walls. This provides for a very unique platforming experience. There is also another game type: which is called endurance. There are 3 different endurance levels. The goal in this game mode is to survive the longest (while collecting gems). By survive, I mean don’t let the timer run out. So, it’s more of a timed trial in which the time can be extended by the player collecting more gems. I had fun playing this once, but other than that, it’s just an extra feature that does not appeal to me as much as the speed run does. I forgot to mention that all the levels are accessible immediately when starting the game, and not unlockable. This is interesting, but it takes away the challenge of unlocking levels as you progress.Achievements/Trading cards: the distance achievements are currently bugged, when I traveled 10 km, I got all six of them. The others are pretty good, some hilarious, and other tedious.Challenging: requires skill and precision, as the controls are a little difficult to work with. You will die a ton, and some levels can take over 10 minutes to beat just because of how difficult they are.Multiplayer mode, also focused on gem collecting.Fairly high price at $7. I would consider $5 to be a little bit more reasonable for what you get gameplay wise. Plus, it has a sort of early access feel.The ball speed feels a bit weird. When you start going forward, the ball launches off at a very high speed. The ball physics take some getting used to for sure.Some suggestions I have: suggestions for game improvement: I think there should be an option that eliminates the necessity of collecting each gem to progress in a level. This would allow the freedom to complete a level at your own pace, not held back by collecting all the gems.Option to adjust mouse sensitivity. This is for UI only, because in-game, it is just fine. It is a hard and slow process navigating through the menu.SummaryIf you like racing, physics-based puzzle platformers, you should definitely check this game out. The few complaints I have are about the price, the way you progress through levels, and the low mouse sensitivity in the UI. Each level in uniquely difficult in its own way. Prepare to fail time and time again.My implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10Handle with caution… 3-4/10Buy on sale: 5-6/10Every day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10This game's rating: 6/10.

												A marble game, where you have to collect Gems leading to the end, in pretty hard levels, and where most of the fun lies in breaking the game in amazing ways.This game has the advantage of being amongst the few marble games on Steam, and it's actually miles better than its predecessor, Spectraball.  There's little you can do, but that's not a bad thing, as you'll be navigating your ball on thin platforms and scale up arrangements of beams, shifting gravity along the way.  Collecting Gems makes even the more open levels linear, but that's an ok enough goal, although it could've been nice if you could see the ghost of the next Gem; you can't collect them out of order.  This game delivers on ""good"" difficulty for the most part.Well, almost, the jumping mechanics sort of doesn't work, pressing the jump button once makes the ball do one of the pathetic jumps I've ever seen, it feels unnatural; you can do a Double Jump, but it's a strange learning curve that might annoy people, as it did for me.  The Magnet Ball, which is used a few times through the game, doesn't really work as advertised, it sometimes sticks off walls and makes gravity shift in unexpected ways, it's almost a better thing to abuse the game's physics (mmh...).  The speed boosters also doesn't really work well, I would go up the ramp after getting the speed, and then I wouldn't get any height.  You'd also have to go though Portals, which does keep you momentum, but there were times where you would go trough one and it dumps you over a small platform, and as the camera freaks out over the sudden change, you would often fall off without being able to do anything.So, it utterly fails at basic things (much like Spectraball now that I think about it), so why am I still giving it a positive review?  Well, as I've said, you could abuse the physics of the game.  For one thing, if you rapidly press the jump button, and I mean Mary Canary fast, the ball makes amazing leaps that break levels, a freaking lot.  Bumping on walls and ceilings also resets the ""Double Jump counter"", which means that you can do wall jumps and scale up things.  Additionally, the Gems have a rather big hitbox, so you could cut corners by being on the opposite sides.  It's surprisingly fun breaking the game like that, and it shaves off a lot of time in trying to do the best time on the leaderboards, for each levels.  The camera also stays perfectly fine on normal instances, despite the Portal incidents, and there weren't really a part of the game where it was being a total meanie.There are 20 normal levels, and 3 challenge levels, the last of which really didn't thrilled me, but it's there.So yeah, Dexterity Ball 3D is quite an oddball, it doesn't really work right most of the time, and yet can be very fun if you abuse its physics like I did.  Dunno, it makes for a very fun speedrun game, and a nice and quick diversion, although perhaps tread carefully, I'm only enjoying this because I'm freaking bizarre.			"

												The majority of the time I can't tell which mechanics are intended or not, it seems broken in a fun kind of way. If $7 is a big investment for you maybe wait until a bigger discount. If you like Spectraball you'll probably like this.			"

												think super monkey ball but you have to get ALL of the bananas, but you can jump and you will die. a lot and it will be your fault. i'd recomend it if your a fan of super money ball, marbel blast and really any other games that you control a ball and die a lot in like dark souls			"
