								Buyer beware!Negatives:- There isn't much game in this current state.- The quality is right there with the worst that came out of Early Access (Surprised they'd allowed this on sale).- Price is way too high, one can have far better and finished games for a fraction of the cost of this one.- The attitude of the developer is rather 'agressive' in the forums (young and his pet project so... He needs some time.)- What is there doesn't make me optimistic that it will improve much.- Bugs bugs and more bugs.To be fair... it's an Early access title so most likely there will be bug fixes, content to be added. I am not optimistic on the capacities of the developer so I imagine the game itself won't be much better and never will be worth the price they will ask. My advice to the developer: Work on your communication skills since the way you handle it atm will only draw in more people with negative opinions and even people who are just out to taunt you.Keep working hard on this title, while I understand it's your first game... it was way too early to put it on steam/ask money for it.

								So this is how I spent 0.6 hours on this game:0.4 hrs meditating at the loading menu (not joking)0.16 hrs trying to figure out whether something is wrong in my game or the plane actually won't fly0.03 hrs wondering why they released it too early0.01 hrs driving a carThe game has potential but it's just... way too early. All you can do is basically driving in circles, and I have no idea why the ♥♥♥♥ they added planes when you cannot throttle even (from my experience at least).Edit: So yeah, alpha v2.0 is out and I still can't get it to work, the long loading times on menus are gone but once I select a track, the game just freezes.

								The game has potential but they did release the game way too early (even for early access).Atm there isnt really a point in playing it cause you can't do anything else other than driving in circles.

The menu is horrible to read.Only 1 car to drive (I heard that this was because of issues with copyright so there might come more soon)Not a fan of the graphics, i do only like the graphics of the vehicles.The game is buggy.There isnt much to do, there are no laps or time.Loading time is really long.I will be checking this game out again over a couple months for sure again cause ive got faith in it.

								This game was first on sale in 2013 (on Amazon). It is still in alpha. Judge for yourself.Update May 28, 2015: The dev team shrinks from [one or] two teens to [definitely] one [see comment section]. (source)Update May 20, 2015: CMS v2.0 alpha (fresh out)Currently, the game has a single mode, which is freeroam, with no AI and no way to run timed laps. The available tracks are Monza and Daytona, and Daytona looked glitchy to me; someone put advetising billboards on the tracks in Monza, creating traffic hazards. There are 7 camera positions per car, which includes an interior cam, but there isn't a bumper cam for all of the models (well, technically, there is, but a ""back bumper cam"" is quite useless for racing), and many of the positions are unsuitable for driving. The deformable tire physics seem gone, and the only bit I was able to deform on the Lamborghini clone was the front. Note that right now, you'll be driving in the dark some of the time, without any street lights. Judging from its current state, it's still going to be years until the game lives up to the promises made on the store page.Sadly, I am now the reviewer with the most hours clocked on the game (and that's not even counting the beta version I own).----------------------Store page promises vs. reality (v2.01 alpha):The first annual Corona MotorSport World Championship is here. Take charge of several of the worlds most exotic and lusted cars and claim your place at the top!No Championship mode, Free Roam onlyMost cars on the store screenshots are no longer in this version of the game.Due to copyright reasons, only two actual cars from Factory Five are in the game, the rest are fantasy cars.No highscore table = no place at the topPlease note this game is currently in Early Access, It will drastically change from alpha to beta to final. More and more content is being added every day.More and more content is being removed with each update; compared to half a year ago, there are now less cars and less tracks. The latest update added 2 new cars. This took over a month.The next generation of indie racing games is here Get behind the wheel of 5 (more added every week) exotic cars and 2 licensed Factory Five Racing cars and wreak havoc! There are currently 3 modes planned for CMS. Freeroam, where you can go crazy on the dozens of maps with every car, truck, helicopter, and plane unlocked. Multiplayer (coming soon) where you can compete against your friends in races or freeroam around the massive city with up to 16 players. and Story Mode: An action packed, tragic, and emotional story of a young aspiring pro racer that ended up in the wrong place and the wrong time(coming soon).  I'm skipping over the issues I mentioned above.7 cars now, but they're not being added by the weekCurrently, there's one game mode: free roam.Currently, there are two maps.No trucks, helicopters or planes.No multiplayer.No races.No city, massive or otherwise.No story.Tracks Transfăgărășan - A beautiful, scenic hill climb, Transfăgărășan has been called one of the best roads in the world spanning over 90km or 55 miles in the Carpathian mountain range - Coming Soon Autodrome Di Monza - A nice track with plenty of straights and challenging curves Nurburgring Nordschleife - A dangerous, 20km track in Germany with plenty of opportunities to wreck - Coming Soon Sochi Autodrom - a beautiful track just recently completed and built around the 2014 winter olympic center in Sochi Miseluk - Serbian street rally with sharp turns - Coming Soon Asia Town - Drifting city based loosely in Hong Kong Snow Island - A large, detailed island racetrack covered in snow - Coming Soon Punta Cana, Dominican Republic - Hi-res satellite imagery of Punta Cana perfect for a stunt plane Large City - Soon to be a massive open world map filled with traffic to smash into (coming soon) Dunsfold Airport - Airfield in Dunsfold, England. Now used as a test track for cars - Coming Very soon Bathurst Circuit - Coming soon Tracks are Monza and Daytona.No traffic of any kind, all you get is your own car.Features Tri-Dimensional Tires Unlike other Unity games, which use Wheel Colliders that only detect a single point on the wheel that create an unrealistic look and feel, this algorithm recognizes the entire wheel model for beautiful suspension simulation and realistic handling. Next-Gen Graphics The Unity 5 update (Alpha 2.0) brings great new features such as Global Illumination, Real-Time vehicle/environment reflections, Dynamic Skies, improved Anti-Aliasing, Bloom, DirectX11 (coming very soon), and much more!Real-Time Damage Physics Using precise mesh calculations and hinge physics, realistic damage is now possible in-game with no lag as well as detachable parts to make you feel guilty wrecking your car! Unrivaled Aircraft Physics Thanks to the power of UnityFS, Corona MotorSport now has realisticly controlled airplanes. The alpha comes with one stunt plane on the Punta Cana map. Aircraft DLC's are planned for the final version.Tires seem to have been changed back to conventional models.Damage looks unrealistic to me and doesn't seem to affect car performance.The track models have little detail, so photorealism goes out the window.When the sun is low in the sky, the car is flashing reflections at me while driving from various points on the body. That looks decidedly unrealistic.The glass on the instrument panel reflects the scenery - in a closed car.No aircraft, no stunt plane, no Punta Cana map.The helicopter in a previous version didn't have realistic controls.

								I've got this game for free, i guess that this game will have more changes coming because actually is an incomplete game, i'm gonna tell you how was my experience with this game:- The loading time at the startup is ridiculous.- Then the menu is not clear and the frame rate is not optimized.- I spend like 15 minutes trying to see: How i can play ?- I tried pressing all the buttons and nothing (the menu only have the settings, credits and photo mode options but not the race mode).- After to press the spacebar, Finally ! a new menu appeared, a global map with some race options. :D- I was happy because i thought that finally i will play but ... SURPRISE, you can only run in circles, no bots or other racers. Also you can drive through the walls.- And maybe you thought what is worse than this ? ... after 1 minute of run in circles i fell off the map and the game crashed. :(They should finish the game first after release it on steam.2 / 10			"

								PLEASE NOTE: I RECIEVED A FREE KEY FOR THIS GAME, BUT AM REVIEWING IT AS IF I HAD BOUGHT ITAs it stands, there isn't a lot going for it. The cars look pretty sweet, they handle and drive ok, and the tuning feature is interesting, but thats about it. At the time of this review, the AI racers are not in the game, so you can only race for time.There are currently 3 tracks, and the textures feel pretty underwhelming. There also aren't that many details to the tracks, so they feel a bit empty.This could be another great racing game, but there are a few things that need attention.1. The HUD is passable, and everything works but it could look a bit better2. The AI racers need to be put back in3. More tracks. there are just 3 tracks right nowI would not recommend this game in its current state, and if I had paid $10 for it, I would probably have used steam's refund feature. It really doesn't feel like a racing game.			"

TL/DR: STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!! don´t even activate it or use another than your regular account for that. ;)where should i start with this one now!?i replayed it, to see if it did change to the better. guess what!? it did change... to get even worse than it was before. i´m not talking about any copyright infringement here (but you might remember the modesl from different games, even if they have been changed a bit).the xbox360 controller works, but no triggers are used. you can activate the controller through the game-menue, but the keyboard isn´t working anymore then (ESC still does though). force feedback is active when it doesn´t make sense at all (on flat ground rolling, not breaking or accelerating). even if you don´t activate the controller and play with the keyboard, force feedback kicks in. if you don´t activate it, you´re stuck with RB to accelerate (exactly...only 100% acceleration that way!)the graphics are just...ugly. the textures look worse than from 1999. there are so huge spaces between map-elements, that you can look right through the world. when you start the game, you can watch the sun and shadows move really fast. at some point it gets pitch black. no ambient lieghts at all (only purple glitches glowing on the sides). it also takes some time for the game to actually activate the lights. obviously that isn´t working like expected at all. you can´t see far away and the light isn´t even realistic one bit. there are no spotlights for the race-track at all.you have the button ""settings"", but it´s locked, so you can´t change anything through the game. i didn´t see if there are *.ini´s to change, because it should work in-game.the physics feel absolutely not like anything i have played before (not even close to real life). that isn´t a compliment. steering is almost not existent at high speeds. feels like a tank, powered by rockets on a frozen lake.

								I don't know what everyone's going on about. Maybe they're in a bad mood or somethin'. Where I'm from, we give a game a gosh darn go at it before we criticize! It says ""Early Access"" for a reason, people!!! Which means, the durn game isn't done yet. So give it some time. Do you criticize the caterpillar for not taking flight??? Exactly.But in all seriousness, please don't buy this at full price. As much as I love this game for a good goof or two, and as much as I respect the developer for gaving a good sense of humor and wish him the best, at its present state, this game is a dud guys. No offense, Lucas. Big proprs, respect ya. Just tellin' it like it is. I'm a simple man with simple tastes and large dreams.Happy Easter everybody.			"

								+ A nice selection of great looking cars to choose from+ The interior / first person view of each car is very well done and highly detailed+ You can fine tune a variety of car settings such as the engine, transmission, suspension, wheels etc. with a surprising amount of options which will impact the performance of the car. The great thing about this is that you can change things at anytime without having to reload.+ Great engine soundsThis game is in Early Access, so these are subject to change- Various bugs / problems that occur frequently. Things like wheels going missing, sliding around while not pressing any buttons, and game breaking issues while trying to load up a new car / track causing you to have to restart the game.- I could not get my controllers to work properly. For some reason the throttle / brake were not bound correctly, and I could not figure out how to rebind them. It shows an Xbox 360 controller in the help menu, but for some reason my xbox controller did not seem to work.- Very limited amount of content. There's really only 2 race tracks or 4 varients. There is no AI to race against. You drive around alone, and I suppose the only real thing to do is the ""hotlap"" which is simply trying to get a good lap time. - The steering feels off...it is VERY hard to make turns without slowing down to a standstill.

								Corona Motorsport is a really good looking Early Access game, but that's what you need to remember, it is still Early Access, don't buy this game if you are looking for a finished product, because it is not. What it is however, is a game with a lot of potentional, the models are fantastic and the art style is really beautiful. One down side to the game for me is the controlls, they're quite unresponsive on most of the cars, this should be improved in my opinion. The price is perhaps a little high at the game's current state but after a few updates that I've heard are planned, I can see the game being a lot more valuable. Overall, it's a fun little tech demo for a game that will one day will be a very accurate simulation of driving and racing.			"

								Corona Motorsport is a marvel of modern game development. I wish I could play it in the shower. The game has enhanced AI that you can race against, and very few bugs during gameplay. There are constant updates to this game to improve it. In regards to Sakif X9's comment, on the overall quality of the game- http://prntscr.com/78cids - this is simply false. What he had done was turn all the graphics setting as low as possible, in an attempt to make the intellectual genius behind this development look bad. With new updates always coming to this game, I find myself constantly coming back to it, much like Skyrim or Fallout. The new graphics shader and reflections packages from a recent update makes everything look professional and clean; the graphics are simply beautiful.With expert game design and a fantastic graphics quality, I could not recommend this game to you more. --Davedkncus.wixsite.com/davidkubala "

								Hmm an interesting one, in some ways its gone well and others horridly. My largest issue is no steering wheel support.Regardless lets get into what the game has to offer.4 cars i refer to them as kit cars you know what car they are meant to be alas they have been altered: there is a veyron, a sixties ford, shelby cobra and i forgot the last one. The model quality is fine, im not sure how i change the colour, not sure how the see the cockpit but without a steering wheel its pretty pointless.oh yeah and theres a plane, i think its that redbull stunt plane but im not sure.There are a few tracks like monza and nords but yes the track selection is rather good. The model quality is passable, id say its about race 07 quality but the nice lighting system just it a lot of justice.On that topic onto the lighting, its easily the best part of it, day night cycle and it allows for more then a single light source(you will be surprised about how many games dont offer this).There are currently no AI, no campaign, its pretty much a hotlap simulator.Im actually going to recommend this, in its current state its not gonna blow your face off alas know more tracks and cars are coming, i also know a campaign and modding support will come also, other features im not so sure currently but we shall see.Currently its not worth £8 but if you can grab it on a sale then its worth a shot, if mod support is done well then this game could last very long. Mods and racing games are a match made in heaven.			"

								As a developer of this game, I've seen this game get built on a sturdy foundation and fall off that foundation many times. I am happy to say that the game now seems to be on a very stable foundation. If you're hesitant about playing a game this early in its life, my advice is to wait until the game is at least in beta, otherwise knock yourself out.			"
