								This game, even in its early stages, is a very satisfying and entertaining couch co-op. If you're a fan of this genre, I encourage you to pick this up, get some friends together and play locally, or gift a few copies for the holidays and play online! I'm excited to see it develop, and was pleasantly surprised to see how quickly the dev's are working out current issues with the game.			"

Pros:Looks niceSounds niceCons:Weird steering/controls;No tutorialNo keyboard supportNo controller mappingNo player marker, I kept getting confused as to which car I was controlling when there were more than 3 cars on the screenOversensitive menu when selecting car colorCar kept getting stuck on barriersCar jittered left and right when turningMaps feel crampt and smallFinal Thoughts:This game has an interesting concept. I would love to see how this game plays in the future with more refined controls and larger, different maps.			"

								Really entertaining game, great core gameplay and lots of fun with other people. Early access so still lacks some polish.10/10 would recommend if you're looking for fun multiplayer games with friends.			"
