								This game is great, just get it. But listen to what i have to say!FOR EPILEPTIC PEOPLE in the level editor i found i rare bug where the screen does basically the most sure thing to trigger an epileptic seizure. The entire screen just flashes at varieing speeds with random colors and shapes. DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF EPILEPTIC SEZUIRES.  Like this comment so other people know, and someone doesn't get hurt.			"

Early Access Review
								[Review date: Dec. 2nd, 2014; one week before Early Access][Edited on March 16th, 2015]Alpha Backer hereFirst and foremost: For a title that just now hits Early Access the game is working surprisingly well. The implemented gamemodes work, offline and online Multiplayer works, leaderboards and steam workshop work too :3+ postive- negativeo neither, but wanted to mentionGameplay / Controls+ Car controls nicely+ Lots of obstacles to avoid. Placement of obstacles can make for great flow in levels, ranging from hectic dodging to smooth precision driving.+ Getting cut to pieces by lasers does not kill you. Instead it chops off a piece of your car, and you can continue with a few missing wheels, greatly impacting the car controls.+ Flying and rotational jets allow for a great amount of agility. It feels badass to just throw in a random backflip.+ Possible overheat from boosting too much keeps player on his toes. The best players will find ways to boost for entire levels by utilizing the stunt-system for heat-management.+ Checkpoints are optional, allowing for offroad search for crazy shortcuts.+ Sprint and Challenge gamemodes require a surprisingly different approach, making for nice variety.o No AI vehicles, but to be honest who would expect that with such a powerfull level editor.- Main menu does not react to mouse input at all. Only part of the game that accepts mouse input is the Level Editor.- No way of saving ghosts or up/downloading replays. All that gets saved is the time / points (depending on gamemode) you got on the track. (Devs plan to implement this)- Game's physics are tied to the FPS, resulting in inconsistent physics below 60 frames per second. Can rarely cause going straight through solid objects unharmed or blowing up on steep quarterpipes that suddenly count as walls.- Stunt-system is lackluster, making both the Stunt and the Speed&Style gamemodes kinda ""meh"". Not a wide variety of tricks, no comboing, cooldown given for stunts doesn't value the aquired points / the stunt difficulty properly (One barrel roll cools 50%, two rolls cool 50%, three rolls cool 55%, so why would I ever do more than one at a time?).Visuals+ Bright, neon-y graphics style, somewhat reminding of TRON.+ Great futuristic racing atmosphere, scrating that itch the same way games like F-Zero or Wipeout do.+ Decently detailed car, which can be recolored for a feeling of individualism (said recolor will be shown in online multiplayer matches!).+ Getting cut to pieces by lasers can look entertainingly goofy.+ Looks great even on lower graphics settings, as long as texture quality is set high.+ A lot of graphics options.+ The entire HUD is on a screen on the back of the car, making the game more emersive.o Activating Bloom is often overkill, causing you to get blinded frequently.o The entire HUD being on the back of the car takes a bit of getting used to. HUD gets pretty much disabled when you get cut in half by a laser.Audio+ Catchy techno soundtrack that has something fitting for every kind of level.+ Music adjusts to surroundings, e.g. becomes muffled in tunnels or gets almost drowned out in zero-g.+ Futuristic soundeffects that always fit their origin (shrieking sawblades, low-pitched rumble for big drones hunting you etc.)+ Can set audio levels for several sources (car, music, environment etc.) independentlyo Music can get old after grinding a level for a few hours, since musictracks are fixed for each level.- The sound of the car's engine is basically just a low-pitched buzz which gets old pretty quickly.Multiplayer+ All tracks are available in Multiplayer, plus tracks from multiplayer-only modes Reverse Tag and Soccer.+ Fully working splitscreen mode for 2-4 players (car collision is ON, so shove that guy off the track! :D ).+ Fully working online mode for up to 6 players per server (no car collision).+ Can connect to a server via serverbrowser or via IP, essentially enabling offline LAN play.+ Host can set password for a lobby, making it private.+ You can play all custom levels from the Workshop online, there even is an auto-download feature in case you're missing a level!o Ingame chat and server messages (e.g. ""x finished the race!"", ""y got wrecked!"") share a chatlog, making it difficult to maintain conversation. But who has time for that anyway, gotta go fast VROOM VROOM.- No dedicated servers.- Soccer and Speed&Style gamemodes cannot be played online, they are local-only.- Reverse Tag mode suffers greatly under higher ping (does not affect other gamemodes).Level Editor+ Big amount of functionality, tons of settings for each individual object. + Can place, resize and rotate objects with high precision for seamless leveldesign.+ Splices on the ends of all track-like pieces, allowing for easy connection between trackobjects as well as intuitive manipulation of tracks.+ Can individually disable abilities of the car for a varied experience, or even set triggers for reaquiring selected abilities mid-level.+ Atmosphere triggers like music changers, skybox changers.+ All advanced hotkeys and shortcuts are also listed as clickable buttons under the 'Tools' tab, making learning the advanced functions less frustrating.o You cannot import custom assets to the editor, like custom models or custom music.o With complexity comes a learning curve. No ""let's just put down some trackpieces"" a la Trackmania, but not too difficult either.- UI sometimes a bit buggy, but can easily be fixed by saving, quitting to menu and re-entering the editor.- Some moving objects have strange behaviour under extreme conditions (like very high movement speed or very small size).

Early Access Review
								It's probably a good time to review now. The developers behind Nitornic Rush made Distance after a successful Kickstrater compaign, in which I was a backer. I played the game since pre-EarlyAccess beta and it's one of those titles that doesn't have a long-lasting attachment feature, yet immediately sinks in as being something unique and great.The production quality of this indie racer made by 6 people is 100 times better than something like The Crew, which shows something... At the very least a clear ability to estimate the workload and project scope in regards to the team's resources. There is no question that the game will be delivered exactly as was promised, if not better, and completely bug-free with great performance. Because it already is. I have no qualms with recommending this even under Early Access because really it is complete. All features promised by Kickstrater campaign have been delivered in time and as advertised. It is strange to praise a company so much just for doing things how they have to be done, but lately so few have been doing so, that as sad as it is, Refract really do stand out as being exceptionally professional and honest about their goals. And having a solid vision to boot.Now the actual game. It's a survival racer where you can drive on tracks, under tracks, on walls, on roofs, you can fly, jump, there are zero-gravity sections and generally a complete and glorious cluster♥♥♥♥ every time you spawn on a level. No signle race will be the same because at some point, someone will decide ""Racing on track is 2lame4me"" and jump on a nearest skyscraper, ride on it's wall to cut, screw up the jump-off, fall onto a lazer and cut off his front wheels (the car doesn't die from that, as long as you can get it to a next checkpoint where it will regenerate any missing parts, it will keep going until it overheats or smashes into something). After that they will make a best attempt to use side thrusters to turn and sprint thruster to get more airtime, overheat, explode and everyone will laugh hysterically.This game is one of those LAN party games that becomes and instant must-have. It is full of hilarious moments. But if Goat Simulator, which is similar in that respect, only has funny moments, Distance posses a huge mechanical depth and complexity unparallelled by any racing game other than Simulators. If you can get past the flying controls and master the ""EveryTHING is a race track"" mechanic of switching between tracks, walls, ceilings, portals, all the while avoiding obstacles and performing tricks to get cooldown and boost more or get more flytime, you will find a very satisfying experience due to the amount of ways every track can be completed in. You can drive to next checkpoint. You can fly to it. You can jump to a wall, drive up, jump off, do a 180‘ flip to land on the part of the track above you and skip to the next checkpoint. You can fly off the track at any time and use building rooftops to skip track parts. And it's not cheating because it takes an enormous amount of skill and training to pull that off without meeting your demise and being reset far back. There is really nothing like this. Distance takes the ""alternative route"" of racing games to a completely new level.Also a very advanced level editor, a ton of levels on Steam Workshop, incredible soundtrack, great graphics and atmosphere, fantastic production quality and a fair price. If you can find friends for a LAN party or organize a group to play in online multiplayer (because generally that part is pretty dead, if you don't organize and host, there are no random servers to join and race), you will have a blast. It is very difficult to properly master this game's 4-dimensional racing, but it's worthit and if you don't want, you don't have to do it. I had a blast taking 14 minutes to reach finish line, just because in those 14 minutes I discovered 34 ways to reach it. Also I love driving half a car. I mean look at my screenshots.TL;DR:RaceWTF I can FLY?Вitch Ima fly past whole track and finish in 15 seconds!*explodes and respawns*Ok, Ima fly to the building, drive on it's wall and jump off 3 checkpoints later!*Does it all*I am so pro biаtches! *Accidently cuts off half a car while flying, with left thuster gone car spins out of the track*♥♥♥♥! Boost! Fly! Next checkpoint! *Explodes from overheat and resets*Ok screw this, I am driving on track.........What's that glowy thing over there? Can I get there? Oooh I can...10/10 would explode again.			"

								Dear Refract Studios,     Nitronic Rush was a revolutionary racing game and the only car game I used to play. Turning such a good idea into this, its incredible. I know this comment will most likely get lost in the others... so sadly yo may never see this... but thank You. Thank you so much for all the hard work obviously put into making this amazing game.

								This is the most entertaining and satisfying action game i played since ... i don't know... 10 years?A 37 years old, moderate geek shouting loud in the spirals devastated by deadly lasers and fire blades. Can't remember when was the last time when my fingers were sweating on the keyboard...Stunning visuals, greatly designed tracks filled with surprises over every corner. Excellent play with gravity. I didn't know that i needed neon lights and lasers so bad. Music is also good, fitting well to the scenery. Hm, what else..If you have little time, but need some distraction from everyday weariness after a long working day, this will shake you up!10/10Ps. hopefully the devs won't stop here and finish the game. It's already a great take, but still has a lot of potential to be even greater. Big up Refract Studios!			"

								This game is really awesome.  As the developer of Road Redemption, I take physics and handling very seriously, and you can tell these guys have spent an amazing amount of time on the little nitty gritty details that makes a racing game feel great.  This game is highly polished and amazingly fun.  It's in Early Access, but I think it's worth the price now, even if they make no further improvements (though it's clear that the devs are updating it regularly, and it's sure to just get better and better as it approaches full release).

								There are few games that can sell me on the gameplay alone, and Distance is one of those titles. If you enjoy arcady racing games with friends with style and substance, then you might want to pick this game up now. Or wait until there is more to come.Is There Enough To Go Around?A common complaint about Distance is the minimal amount of creator made content. There is a servicable ""story mode"" that is a good tutorial to wrap your head around the game's basic mechanics, but it's only halfway done. It also doesn't utilize all the game modes in it, so it's not a tutorial for everything. And if you don't screw up too much, you might get an hour and a half of substance.But then you have to take into consideration the wide variety of user-created Steam Workshop maps right now. Currently there are over a thousand user-made content. Most of these maps are probably meant for solo so-hard-yet-so-fun players, not so much for multiplayer players. (Or it feels like it from what the devs showcase on their updates.)The best way to think about Distance is to think about it as a game similar to Audiosurf. You can plug in your own tunes into the game, you can get tons of hours of enjoyment out of the game itself, and the amount of content is more to what is to your tastes.Thankfully, you won't have to rely on crap-shooting for good user-made content. You can type in a custom search engine in-game to find the types of tracks you are looking for, whether it be thematic things like LIMBO or TRON or Super Meat Boy levels of challenge.I've only played a single game of multiplayer with one friend, so I cannot say anything about the merits of tis multiplayer longevity. We had fun doing challenge tracks meant for one player while racing one another. (We intentionally crashed into one another a lot.)Oh, and best of all, the game's multiplayer can be online or split-screen. Leave it to an indie game from EA to bring back the couch.The point of this section is to state that however much content is left to add into the game, which I sometimes wonder what is left to do other than better optomize the game itself, you will find as much content as you're willing to put into the game. You Sold Me On the CarI'm not going to lie. When I saw what the car can do--fly, do barrel rolls for boosting, and for doing precise jump manuevers with antigravity tracks in Tron--I wanted to get into this game immediately. The inner child who played with Hot Wheels and who wanted to go drive around in Tron came out with this game, and I have no regrets for it.However, because of the complexity of the controls, I don't think everyone will find them comfortable on the keyboard. Doing the necessary tricks to hop off one track and continue on another requires a lot of quick-reactions. Sometimes the maps themselves will limit your abilities, so you need to be comfortable with your controls.It's a little difficult to explain, but the gist of the controls is you steer with one thumbstick and rotate the car with the other. You have a button to boost, another button to jump, and another button to engage flight-form.The game utilizes all of these in complex manuevers. Sometimes you'll need to do a ninty degree flip to swtich lanes, or you need to maintain your boost by doing tricks to maintain your energy. Or maybe you need to engage flight-mode to get back on to the track when you fall off. It feels all natural to use when you get a feel for the controls.Your car is also able to be split apart by lazers, buzzsaws, etc. It's a really interesting visual effect to cut your car in half--but you won't immediately lose if your car gets damaged. If you can sustain the car to the next checkpoint, your car will get auto-repaired. However, based on what gets hacked off, your ability to control the car is also changed.The gameplay is very simple, but with all the different modes takes those mechanics into different manners of playing the game. You have a HORSE style mode, a time-trial mode, a Tony Hawk tricks mode, and a no-checkpoint-shorter-levels mode.There is no weaponry or other arcady elements from other racing games if you were hoping for something like Sonic All-Star Racing/Mario Kart/Diddy Kong Racing in Tron. Nor are there AI opponents to race against like with those games. Distance isn't that kind of game.At its core, Distance is a racing game with more flash and style. But with a really, really sick car.Are There Other Dents?The game can run very shoddy at times because of all the visuals thrown into the game, so if you want the best experience you should close other applications for the best performance. Other than the optomization issue and the questionable amount of content, I don't know how else to criticize the game. The controls feel responsive enough; the gameplay offers more than racing itself; and the game itself is really, really good.You'll have to ask yourself if that is enough to sell you on the game. If not the car, then check out the soundtrack too.Rating of Completion/CompetenceHere is a detailed list of my scale: 1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features. Far too early to get into the games. Also, games that get updates infrequently. 2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates.4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers. Of course, the timing of these updates should be with respect to the size of the development team. 5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.The simple raiting is a brief summary to describe the state of this game. The detailed rating goes into the nuances of what is available in Distance.Simple Rating: 3/5Detailed Rating: 11/20 (55%). A cautious recommendation only for the gameplay.Content: 3/5Multiplayer, all game modes, the second type of car (which gives a double-jump at the cost of no flight mode) and the Steam Workshop level editor are in the game. However, what remains besides the story mode is vague. Quality: 4/5The core gameplay is refined enough that I would consider it in a complete state. The only thing that may hamper it are the optimization problems.Optimization: 2/5If you wish to get the best mileage with Distance, then you don't want other programs to be in the background.Productivity: 2/5While I appreciate the community involvement from the developers making fan-made contests and showcasing their creations, I would appreciate more if they added their own content more frequently. Or simply finish the rest of the game to be in a playable state to get more interest.The updates and bug fixes are frequent enough to let me know they are still working on the game. But I think so many people on the fence with Distance would buy this game if all the features were complete. We're nearing the first year mark of Distance--hopefully, as the devs state, we'll get the full product by 2016.You can only get so far with selling me with the car before I start to question whether we'll ever reach the end.

INTROWhen you think of some of the more polished, visceral games made by indie studios, you may be thinking of Rocket League, ARK and Space Engineers, but you haven't heard much or anything about Distance!What a shame! Time to change that and get you invested into this wonderful game, I have tried to explain every aspect of the game after playing for 90hrs;--------------------------------------------------------------SUMMARYDistance is a survival racing game, it combines the intense action gameplay into an arcade racing experience, speeding through a futuristic world. You have tight control of a speedy car that allows you to, boost, jump, rotate, fly and avoid obstacles through intense levels. An extensive level editor allows you to create any track you want to make and there are dozens of high quality tracks to choose from in the workshop that are all playable in multiplayer and local (split-screen) co-op.  While you may find yourself exhausted by Distance's mechanics, there are different game-modes, sprint, speed and tricks, 'catch me if you can' and even a soccer game mode to play. The many different tracks will surprise you time and time again and challenge you to race on until you complete the track successfully. Currently 20$ is more than fair and you'll certainly not be bored quickly by DISTANCE.--------------------------------------------------------------PROS Diverse tracks to play in the base game, bundled together in 'campaign' mode that'll teach you the mechanics of the game, serves as an  introduction to the game  Extensive and tight controls; offer a complete and very responsive control over your car (all controls are completely re-bindable to your liking) Nimble and flexible gameplay mechanics; not a typical stale A to B racer; obstacles, short cuts, loopings, riding on walls, skidding and jumping off walls, jumping from one platform to the next, rolling, traps and even flying! Multiplayer; with a fairly crowded community, at least 5-10 players online when I've tried, local ! split-screen multiplayer (whens the last time you've seen that?)  Extensive level editor; to make your own levels for the game, you can create pretty much any kind of level you want, all the tools are there to be used, tracks, traps, decorations, lots of assets. All of them can be played in multiplayer.   Learn from the workshop; there are already dozens of fun tracks to downloaded live (no need to restart your game) into your game and play. - See what mechanics will work for your own levels.  Mechanics react to your actions; sprinting heats up your car and you will explode if you use it for too long, 'cool-down' gates reset your heat, car reacts to damage taken meaning half your car can get chopped off, still you'll be able to get to the next gate, perhaps with greater difficulty  All the HUD, is on the back of your car, your screen remains largely uncluttered  Neat futuristic sound track  Ability to add your own music   Tense atmosphere; neat effects, futuristic surroundings, and diverse assets  Control over many gfx settings, AA, shadows, film grain, borderless fullscreen... it's all there  Leaderboards and scores, not really a pro but ups the replayability per level slightly- trust me you will want to replay a level and improve your score --------------------------------------------------------------CONS  The level editor; it is a bit of a hassle to get started with and the few tutorials are a good start but it will all be overwhelming to start with, I suggest taking a look at Niven511's detailed start on building levels   The main campaign offers too little, too few; It's a rather short, high quality intro to the game that will leave you asking for much more, you will need to re-route to community made levels and multiplayer [Dev has said campaign is already much longer in an internal build, update soon]   The game may feel light-weight; beneath all the flashy, innovation the game offers you may find yourself unsatisfied that there is little to do than to reach the end of each track, there isn't much sense of progress; the diverse traps, effects, the heating up mechanic and different game modes counter this con to an extent but leave the game feeling like it may be missing something after you have played it for several hours. The moves you can do remain limited, there is no AI to beat, the obstacles remain fixed as an 'add-on to the track', only 1 achievement currently  There is only one vehicle model; no other cars to pick from. You can customize the the colours of your car though [Dev has said there will be another car added soon]  A bit of a learning curve; you might get lost quickly, find yourself frustrated with the little mistakes that punish you, the overheating and the controls you'll need to learn. You'll can get over this after you've played for a few hours-------------------------------------------------------------9/10I recommend you go the distance and buy the game! "

								Wow. Not very far in...about 3-4 hours. But when I know I have found a badass game, I know.Imagine those fast paced old school games of dodging obstacles moving at high speeds.Now add in jumping.Add 4 pivot jets to control airborne movement.Add wings for flight, dogrolling and all.Now add gravity.Now add gravity in not just in 1 direction.Now add other people.This game has the best kind of video game progression. You gain skill.You start with fundemental basics. Die alot. Suck at controls.You learn. Now you are boosting and dodging good now.You overheat if you hold down boost too long.Now you learn that doing tricks (barrel rolls, backflips/frontflips) reduces the cooldown of your boost.Later slow driving. All of this adds more and more and more the more you play. You'll amaze yourself at what you can do after 5 hours of play compared to the first hour.Insane fun. Easy to get in games, easy to leave.

								So I guess I have enough time in game to finally review this game. It's pretty good, when you start playing you are focusing on just finishing the track without dying, then finishing it without scraping anything, then getting diamond, then you realize the roads are really just a suggestion so you start making your own routes, and on and on and on it goes. I have put in an honestly rather disgusting amount of time playing this game and still feel like I'm improving and have things to learn.

								It's like Trackmania but tracks are littered with lasers and moving circular saws.It's like Rocket league but with actual racing.It's like Mario kart except it doesn't help losers.It's all of the above, but more awesome than it sounds.It kinda requires a controller, though. So make sure to buy one if you don't already own one.I *would* tell you to drive safely, but yeah......it's not gonna help.			"

Early Access Review
								Personal note (18/03/2016): One of the few steam games that you always get back to and never get bored of.Personal note (23/12/2015): Most underrated game on steam.---------------------------------This unique racing game is a lot of fun! I played the story mode, uploaded my own level ('[Challenge] Damnation'), started multiplayer and instantly met friendly players whom I played hours with!Pros Level Editor (Easy to handle; getting started tutorial; comfort tools like 'move along the track' or 'flip' makes it easy to decorate a track.) Workshop with a lot (and by that I mean 'freaking grains of sand at a beach' lot!) of user created levels. Cool driving mechanics like deployable wings for flying capability, deployable jet thrusters and hydraulic jumping to manoeuvre in zero gravity fields or to twist the car around for wall/ceiling rides.) Kickstarter project with already unlocked goals which will be implemented when the game is out of beta: ClickThose are for example: Replay/Spectate Modes (With fast forward/play/pause and driving against your Ghost.),Cinematic camera angles/free camera and Random Track Generation Mode (create vast number of unique tracks at the click of a button with parameters for tweaking and capability to share specific seeds so you can show discovered tracks to friends. You shouldn't be able to workshop-up those!) Various Modes like Challenge, Sprint, Stunt, Speed & Style, Free Roam.. Multiplayer with easy to set up servers. Great audio which makes the tracks colors pulse with the beat! (Importing custom audio is suggested.) Nice, friendly and funny community Support for various plattforms and controller. Small team of devs who  are really confident to make a much more polished and professional game sequel to Nitronic Rush. They have key developers from Nitronic Rush in their team and bring much experience with them. Great forum moderators who take every suggestion thread into consideration and give constructive criticism. There is also a thread with many already suggested ideas listed: Click[survivethedistance.com]Many of those got green light from the devs. Moderators and some devs are playing the game nonstop themself and checking out on the workshop levels, too!Cons Not a fan of the Unity Engine, but I start to like it when thinking about what Distance accomplished with it. Beta status is missing many promised features and is short on many Multiplayer Host options like kick/ban.Also, Adventure Mode & everything is incomplete and subject to change etc.. Not being able to import custom content (audio, textures, models, scripts) to the level editor yet. (But there're simple objects like cubes you can create objects with, group them and save them as ""costum object"".) Multiplayer is sometimes dead. No servers or anything. People come to live when it is getting midnight in europe.As you can see this game is pretty much worth a buy!The next stable update will have better physics, better handling and a great cockpiet view!! I already tested it on the experimental build.			"

Early Access Review
GeneralI've been waiting for the right time to post my review for Distance, and the most recent update (build 3520, the workshop discovery update) provides the perfect time for me to do so. I bought into the late alpha backer stage in June 2014, and as my playtime would suggest, I've not regretted this in the least bit. Distance was well worth the almost 3x price to buy into that stage ($55), and it has only improved it's features and content since then. This game is a steal for the current $20 it rests at, and I am confident any cons listed in this review or many of the other reviews will be ironed out before it leaves the Early Access stage.Early AccessYes, this game is still in the early access stage. For many games that may means bugs, few updates, lazy devs, and etc. but Distance, and its devs, are far exceeding those predispositions people may have about early access as a concept. It had a very successful Kickstarter campaign and it was also a Steam greenlight game. The game itself is in a fully working and stable state. The main reason behind staying in early access instead of going ahead and releasing is one thing - Features. The devs are very dedicated and have a laundry list of features they expect to be in their game before they consider it complete, and this is why it is in early access. The main features left to be added to the game at the point of writing this review are as follows: At least one alternative vehicle to choose from (+one other for kickstarter backers), an ""announcer"" similar to that of Nitronic Rush but in a different styling to fit the desolate Distance atmosphere, a full replay system with ghosts to race against, randomly generated tracks, and a full adventure story mode (part of which is currently in-game). I'd encourage whoever is considering buying this game to look past the early access tag and see the game for what it is, a very complete experience with some major new features on the way.DevelopersThe developers are not treating this (early access) as a cash cow opportunity to make a profit and run, abandoning the game - they are very active within the community and are an easy bunch to contact if need be. There is no downside I can speak of when talking about the developers in the 9 months I've participated in the community thus far - they are an amazing team and I'm glad they are the ones to be making this great game. Anyone active in the Distance community has probably talked to them at some point, whether it be about a bug report, feature suggestion, or just discussing some of the many community workshop tracks. Occasionally they will host a livestream event to show off some of the community-created tracks on their Twitch[twitch.tv] and we have some great fun asking questions while they host a multiplayer server. All of their contact info is in the bottom-right corner of the Distance homepage[survivethedistance.com].Level EditorThe level editor is very complex, and a few reviews have listed that as a con, but I see the complexity of it as a good thing. The more complex it is, the more can be done in it. Yes, it won't be easy to do, but the complexity means that it can be done. There are a few level editor tutorials in the works, so they should help new players learn how to use it more easily. If you have the patience to sit down with it for a while and just play around, then you'll find that it is a very extensive editor that allows you to create pretty close to anything you want.Pros ListI'll be stealing some of my pros and cons from other reviews, but we are all talking about the same game so the lists would be fairly similar anyway. I suggest taking a look through Icebound777's review for a comprehensive pros/cons listing.The controls are tight, and the game supports many, many types of controllers including racing wheels and flight sticks.There is a lot of track variety and full Steam workshop support for the level editor.The agility of the vehicle makes the game handle more like a platformer than a racer, giving it a ""new"" feeling to the racing genre.There is no concept of ""out of bounds"" in Distance - any surface can be driven on and treated as a potential track. This leads to some crazy routes to get to the end of some tracks.The competition on the global leaderboards is tight, even with all the off-road routes driving on buildings.The community encourages players to use the vehicle mechanics to their full potential, and even publishes videos of how to complete tracks faster to help any players improve their times (people don't keep ""fast"" routes a secret).You can watch a replay of any time on the global leaderboards and race ghosts of them.The vehicle can be recolored with completely custom colors and those colors show up in multiplayer.There is splitscreen with up to 4 players, fairly rare on pc games - as well as online multiplayer.Extensive graphics settings to be configured, including things such as ""Film Noir"" for a black and white look or ""Stylized Outlines"" for the Borderlands look.The car can be cut into pieces by lasers or saws, making for some interesting gameplay trying to control the vehicle without a couple wheels.The soundtrack. Seriously, just go listen to it[soundcloud.com].All audio levels can be edited separately (music, car, environment, etc.)Local custom music support to play mp3's and have the game lights react/pulse to it (Windows only currently).All official and workshop tracks are available in multiplayer. The host needs to have the tracks locally in order to play them however.Not having a workshop track in multiplayer is no big deal, say hi to automatic workshop downloading!There is the option of creating private, password-protected, servers, and a ""connect via IP"" to allow for offline LAN play.Comprehensive and complex level editor allowing you to run wild with whatever crazy ideas you may have.Multiple gamemodes including:Sprint (point a to b race/time trial)Challenge (similar to Sprint, but no checkpoints and no deaths allowed)Stunt (do stunts to get the highest score)Speed and Style (similar to sprint, but the score you get from doing stunts is subtracted from your time)Soccer (only available in splitscreen, it's soccer with a giant ball and nets)Reverse Tag (capture the flag/king of the hill type gameplay where you try to hold onto a bubble for a cumulative 3 minutes and the bubble enlarges the longer you hold it making it harder to keep)Cons ListIf you've played Nitronic Rush, there is currently no announcer in Distance - It is planned.No option of a standard HUD apart from the back of the vehicle, making getting cut extremely annoying in some situations.Currently no dedicated servers, the host has to be playing the game and picking which tracks to play - however this has been hinted at as something the devs want to be in.No custom assets in the level editor - that means objects or music. Local custom music is supported, but no workshop support.Difficulty and skill curve could use some tweaking but if you stick with it, it is possible to learn the ropes fairly quickly.General bugs/glitches "

Early Access Review
								Call me a dork, but I would never buy this game on sale. It is worth every penny the developers have put on it's price tag, and here's a lazy amateur breakdown of why:• It looks amazing. The game really is very atmospheric, with great sense of speed, and every level feels unique. It's arcade with personality, and pretty great graphics. Honestly, I don't need to say much when there's beautiful screenshots up there.• It sounds amazing. As with Nitronic Rush, the music is one of the greatest things about this game. Even if you don't like the genre as much, you'll find it fitting and very well crafted. Not to mention it interacts with the level, making lights blink to the beat and things like that.• It plays amazing. When we talk about controls in this game, it's important to note that you actually feel you're in control. Which is very important, considering this is survival racing. You often need to act fast, and everything is as responsive as you'd expect. Oh, and the delirious stunts you can pull make you feel awesome. And when you successfully recover from a mistake instead of resetting? That's the stuff.• The developers are extremely passionate, and very good at what they do. That combo means a handful of things: They are very thorough, listen to the community feedback with great care, and in fact get really involved with the player base. A chance to play with one (or more!) of the devs online is barely difficult.• It's got a powerful level editor. And people make the most amazing things with it. It's got primitives, which means you can basically create anything you think of, if you have the time. As a matter of fact, most of my play time was spent in the editor. Creating is fun, and sharing is easy.• Failing is often surprisingly fun to watch. Being suddenly flung out of the track, spinning ferociously, crashing into a nearby building, and exploding into many pieces, all in a matter of seconds... It can be a good laugh. Why be frustrated? It looks great even when you suck.This is one early access game you can trust. It's the most polished and feature complete beta of a game I've seen, and yet it seems to only grow and improve further. Buy this game, buy this game, buy this game. Sorry, that's a bit pushy.			"

								    If you like Tron, Nitronic Rush, challenging games, car-parkour, dubstep/techno, and atmospheric Indie games that are better than most triple-A titles, you will love this game.     Distance is a really good example of Indie done well, from the music to the visuals, Distance is not just a game, but a masterpiece of art. The atmosphere is prominent, the community is amazing, and the game itself is a very good successor to Nitronic Rush.The good things:-Visuals are fantastic, one of the best looking Indie games I’ve ever seen-The controls are fully customizable-The level design is stunning, beautiful, and fun-Hundreds of community levels, many of which rival the official levels in terms of quality-Music is extremely catchy and fits the visuals really well-Many graphics options-Online multiplayer-Experimental branch for those interested-Challenge levels to put you skills to the test-Unique game mechanics-Short loading times-Powerful built in level editor-Controls are very responsiveThe not so good things;-Performance isn’t always amazing, but a decent PC will run the game fine (keep in mind physics is FPS based, lower FPS = worse physics)-Physics will be weird on occasion (not very often)-Some obstacles are difficult to see, not all obstacles stand out very well (you’ll get used to it though)    As you can clearly see, the good heavily outweigh the bad. If you are looking for a high quality Indie experience you can dig right into, this game is for you.			"

								If you like racing games, buy this.If you like neon lights, buy this.If you like EDM, buy this. The soundtrack is amazing!The single player adventure mode does what other racing games can't do which is provide emotion to the player. You are actually pretty terrified of the drastic music and atmospheric change the first time. And the f***ing sound the orange ball thing makes is still disturbing. The music seems to sync with checkpoints and when you die or pass objects. It is immersive and really cool. Can't wait for when the rest of adventure mode is out.			"

Intro Distance is a racing game where your main goal is to survive and to get to the end of the level. It’s just you and the track. There are no opponents that can run you off the road, but there are many obstacles. But is it interesting enough to keep you going ? Gameplay When you first start you’re put into the seat of a futuristic racing car where you have to race across tracks and just survive. Just. Survive.But this is not just an ordinary car. Your car can, besides racing at insane speeds, also turn mid-air, fly, boost and jump. It’s quite spectacular to see your car appear, especially with the HUD being projected on the car itself. There’s no true HUD, because the car will show you all the vital information: the direction you need to go to, your boost meter, your speed-o-meter and a timer. The timer allows you to set a high score and I guess that’s the true goal of the game: repeating a level over and over again and hoping that you get better and beat your previous high score(s). All of this is done while you complete random tracks. At the end of the track you’re being teleported to a new one where the whole process begins anew. Except that it gets more difficult with each new track. You’re gradually introduced to new gameplay mechanics and after about 10 tracks or so you should know exactly what to do when an object appears out of thin air or when a new part of the track suddenly appears beside or above you. That still doesn’t make it an easy game. On the contrary; it’s a hard game and you have to choose when and how long you want to boost and you have to perfect your flight and trick abilities at the same time. You’ll frequently crash and burn.That’s partly thanks to the game itself (well, the game designers really), because it doesn’t always let you fly whenever you want to. For me personally it was very confusing because I had no idea when I could or couldn’t use it. Whenever I was about to drop down a track I just pressed the button and hoped that it would work. Unfortunately this didn’t work more than half of the time. When you’re playing a game where the goal is to get to the end of the track as quick as possible then you don’t want to have worry about if you’re being able to fly or not whenever you’re about to crash. It’s a small design flaw in my eyes. You either let people know that they will be able to fly during a track or you don’t. You can’t just change things up halfway through a track. But enough about that for now; it’s still an Early Access title and we must have faith that things can still change. And obviously I understand that the developers want to add an extra layer of difficulty to the game this way. I haven’t yet talked about some of the things that will appear on the track so I’ll try to spend a minute talking about that. The game starts with introducing ramps and other basic/common things you find in most race games. After a while, huge, sharp rotating blades can be seen cutting into the tracks as well as laserbeams moving around trying to cut your car in half (which really does happen and you can then decide to either try and get to the next checkpoint or you can reset to the last one). Not much later you’ll also encounter blocks appearing out of thin air, rotating fans and spikes coming in from all sides. Plenty of stuff to keep you on your toes, as you can see. The game has an Adventure Mode and an Arcade Mode. Adventure Mode is the single-player mode that I was just talking about where you follow a story (yes, there’s a story). Arcade Mode lets you play solo, split screen or online.  Solo gives you different choices than split screen and online so there’s plenty to do. I haven’t yet tried any of the modes except for Adventure Mode but unfortunately that one is incomplete and still being worked on. I’ve seen glimpses of the story but I’m not quite sure that I understand what it’s all about. Maybe soon. Graphics & Audio Graphically Distance is pretty impressive with dark lighting and a dark atmosphere in general, only brightened by colorful neon colors that appear on the tracks and specific objects (now I think about it; it’s shown on pretty much anything that can kill you). It has a cool Tron-like vibe but unfortunately the game uses a lot of basic geometry. Levels are kinda boring and the car itself doesn’t have much detail. I get that it’s futuristic but a little more variety in the tracks would’ve brought the game to life. But, since I don’t know if it’s part of the story I can’t properly talk about it I guess. So again, maybe we’ll know when the game finally releases somewhere next year. The audio consists of sci-fi music with a somewhat frantic tempo. It fits the game completely so this is all good. Sounds like your car crashing and beams and blades closing in also sound great. No, the sound department is just fine. Length/Replayability Since this is an Early Access title the game isn’t yet complete. Still, the Adventure Mode can take you anywhere between 1,5-3 hours I think. After that you will probably have seen it all until the next part of the game releases.But, of course, you can always spend some time with the Editor to create some new tracks yourself, or download custom made tracks from the Steam Workshop. That will add at least several hours extra to the total playtime. Closing Distance hasn’t entirely become the game that I initially expected. I don’t know exactly what I was expecting, but I think that I was expecting a game similar to WipeOut maybe. While it doesn’t even come close to being that game this game is good in its own right. Partly thanks to the fact that it tries to do something different. I honestly can’t think of a game that uses these kind of mechanics so that’s absolutely a good sign. While it can definitely use some more polish and maybe a few changes here and there I certainly like what I’ve been playing thus far. And who knows what more we can expect in the near future ? I for one am looking forward to the final release. For now I’ll rate this as follows: [Rating: 76/100]			"

 Distance is a supurb experimental racing game sure to hook you instantly and not let go I have been following this game for years anxiously waiting for the release, and Im happy to say it even   exceeded even MY expectations  Design Everything about the visuals is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and it is no understatement to say that you will be sitting there in awh at points in the campagin. Even the lowest graphic settings makes the game look pretty good. The visuals are also very very optimized, guaranteed to run on almost any machine, which seems to be quite rare with these Early Access Games. Very tron inspired and im a sucker for those kind of aesthetics. Sound Crisp and clear. I was suprised at the amazing sound quality. From the woosh of passing large objects to the crashing sound effects everything about the sounds are just awesome. Music One of the games HUGE strong points. The music fits perfectly with everything. From the high octane Drum&Bass tracks to the chilled out electro you'll defenitley find yourself bobbing your head to the beat. Amazing soundtrack (If only they separately sold it) Gameplay I personally play with a gamepad but keyboard and mouse feels excellent with little to no complaints. However it's prefered to play the game with a controller/gamepad to get the full feel of the controls. With it everything feels so much smoother and I also recomend using the advanced controls for more finer flips tricks and stunts! Wonderful controls Multiplayer The ""Distance"" community is some of the best I've run into. I havent encountered a single problem with the people. The multiplayer gamemodes consist of a simple racing mode, to reverse tag (my personal favorite) and a challenge/stunt mode. All of which you can sink hours into, and theres even more gamemodes to come! Level Editor / Steam Workshop Possibly the coolest part of this game. The level editor is so easy to pick up and learn and you can just upload to the workshop with a press of a button. And getting maps is even eaiser! Overall thoughts A MUST BUY. You have a unique racer combined with an explosive soundtrack, breath taking visuals, a friendly community, and a wonderful level editor. What more could you want?!     "

								In a game you are racing a car.Against what? Time, death, the apocolypse? No, you race against yourself.Whether you are hypnotized by the somewhat calming but exciting frequency as the sound of tame but chaotic percussion on your long midnight drive into the abandoned areas of which you so delicately turn the wheel to.Or maybe perhaps you are simply keeping your head, making only the absolute minimal turns as you dodge the exonerate obstacles and navigate the sleek paths while never intending to let go of the accelerator.Perhaps instead you are instead the type to take the eloquent route of the persuasive vocal pathways, and yes, the walls do speak to you my friend, they always have, and you listen, you even hear the ground beneath you grow ineffective as you lift up from the road into a much greater road.And even if, you just so happened to be the daring type, trying your best to be in complete control of kinetics, the forces as your final goal is to bring your car back onto a path only after such a prodigious display of control and finesse.Whatever it is, it is you, and you continue only to better yourself, you have only to gain, you are the driver, you are the car, and you are free.

								YES YES YES YES!!!This game gave me the goosebumps when I first played.The audio from music to sound effectsed, the models from cars to these huge structures are truely AMAZING.The controls for the keyboard are great for a game that would be better played with a controller.In the storyline each new feature of the car and obstacle on the course are introduced FLAWLESSLY.I never knew that I could be scared in a game about driving, but that proved me wrong.Although there is a flying mechanic, I prefer to stay on the ground, but it's still fun.This is not like any other game I've played. The audio, animation, gameplay, muliplayerability. IT'S AWESOME!Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!			"

								I've been playing the game for only an hour now and I can tell:+Game graphical side is beautiful, at first you may have some problems to see upcoming objects, but thats no deal later.+Adventure mode at the moment (1st day of August 2015) is still in development, but the story is indeed intriguing.+Arcade mode is hell out of fun to play on split-screen mode (yes, this game has a split-screen mode!)+The in-game editor will let you do anything you desire with the game, its complexity ends only on the interface, rest is easy and the effects are amazing!+Soundtrack is good for all the electro-style people+Optimalization is really well-done, I had full settings and fps dropped only 3 times to around 35 fps (I'm using 4 years old PC)What's bad about it tho:-We have to wait for adventure mode to be completed to see what's up with the story.-The online mode is yet empty (atleast here in central europe)Obviously recommend to anyone that loves crazy, skill based type of racing ! ! !Also a little bonus:This game synergize with the music you play, the car tone bars are playing and the track is bouncing with your beats. :)			"

								Although the game isn't finished yet, what they did to it in a little over three years is amazing. As other people probably stated in other reviews, this game was based off of a college project game called ""Nitronic Rush"" (look it up and you could try it out for free). It stood out from other racing games in the way that you had to survive several deadly obstacles in order to finish the track. The biggest complaint about the game was that there was no multiplayer. So that's one main feature that they added into Distance. Another interesting feature that they added into the game (kinda shocked me) was a level editor with Steam workshop support. This definitely had me sold when It was finally released. So if you're finally board of track mania, give this game a shot. It's much better and much more challenging.			"

The developers behind this are SUPER awesome and you can feel that they truly want whats best for the game at all times. They arent in this for the money. They are in it to make the dream that is Distance come true.If you in any way enjoy making levels for games. This is a MUST have. The level editor is amazing and will allow you to do pretty much anything your heart desires!			"

								Hands down love this game! It has that arcade sensation, high speed ""must go faster"" mentality while smirking at the wreckless destruction of your opponents' failed attempt at flying to the other side of the track when you need to change gravity. Pressing down the accelerator with the firm grip of your hands, cracking your controller/keyboard with the hopeful desire that the working half of your car, divided by lasers or saws, will pass the regeneration checkpoint so you don't have to redo that one part over and over and over again is a thrill like no other and when you do cross that line--it is a high like no other.It reminds me of Rush 2049 with the wings on the car and the stunts; I am sure it had some inspiration to this game. The tracks are wonderful, the workshop gives it tons of replayability. Create your own tracks. Game modes like Tag, Challenge and Stunt. What else could make this game perfect? More car customizations? More obstacles? Ambient supplement? I mean we could ask for a lot, but the bare necessities are there and they are glorious. If you play with controllers, be prepared to have some spares. The frustration is beautiful.			"

								I loved Nitronic Rush, so I could easily recommend this game. This also makes me a bit bias, so stating this outright. If you wish for a Demo, search for Nitronic Rush. Over all it is a well-polished game with little to no bugs, and only increases in its polish and content.-----Distance is a survival racer; Get to the objective as fast as possible with minimal deaths. Go upside down, dodge lasers, and do it in style doing flips and tricks using small rockets inside the car, along with wings to fly through the map. By default these are controlled with the sticks on gamepads or wasd with the arrow keys.Multiplayer, co-op, a rocking sound track and Steam workshop make this game all the better, with new songs being added all the time and a massive dedicated community of map makers who have been around since the map editor was a hidden asset in the original game.Current complaints are no mouse compatibility for menus, and as of the time of writing, the campaign is missing quite a few levels, a bit of a steep learning curve for the level editor in my opinion and an inability to sort levels in menus when using the level selector, but both are easily fixable as the beta continues. In terms of difference from Nitronic Rush, flying is bound to space when in air, which I’m not a fan of personally but it's preference (and can be changed in menu).The Developers have been very open with the backers through this process and have been providing plenty of updates to keep backers of the original Kickstarter up to date, I personally believe they will finish the project and it will be fantastic.

What is it?A futuristic racing speed/style game very much in the style of Space Haste and Megarace and other one-time futuristic racing classics, but without opponents and set in a dark, neon vibe.  Atmospherically, this is the best sci-fi racer I've played.  The game offers a single player story campaign, arcade racing mode, multiplayer and a fully fledged Level Editor in which you can build your own tracks.  The Steam Workshop is already integrated, offering an infinite resource of game content far beyond what is already offered in the game itself.  Best of all, you can specify any random phrase or word in the editor - and a track, with scenery and such as in the campaign will be added for you.  While it IS just as easy as typing a word and racing the resultant track, there is some sophistication built in: using certain words in your 'phrase' will add more sprint sections, particular effects, or more flight etc.  It's utterly brilliant and you don't have to be a boffin in order to use it (well, I used it - 'nuff said...).  There is also a full-blown track editor too if you really do want to craft your own by hand.How difficult is the racing?The racing part has absolute precision controls and difficulty in the single-player campaign curves gradually.  There have been past similar titles where you can find yourself bouncing from one wall to the other, but not this one - it's lovely to play.  Jumps and flips are taught by button-prompts on-screen.  Flight sections can be a fair bit tricky however.  Straight flight is easy enough, but the roll mechanics of the vehicle are very strange and I find it very tricky to fly around corners without rolling uncontrollably and spiralling to death.  It takes some skill to play these parts, but practise does pay off and reaching the end of the campaign feels like a genuine achievement. Until then, expect a challenge - especially with gravity being a thing when you're not sure which way up you're facing!  Falling to crash UPWARDS is often the only time I realise I'm completely flipped.  It's crazy and it's silly - but above all it's fun.  Gamepad ninjas will blaze through it, and then roll around the floor laughing at the rest of us with our 50+ attempts to get through that maddening flippy dodgy section without burning up.  The game offers full controller support, including racing wheels and gamepads.  However, while the game can be played with a wheel, the best experience is experienced either with keyboard or gamepad for lighting-fast reaction play.A word of warning: if you suffer from any photo-sensitive condition like photo-sensitive epilepsy, this game might not be for you because there is a lot of flashing neon.  Watch the trailer videos first and judge for yourself.About that Early Access thing...The single-player campaign is rather short at the moment and, on its own, is not enough to warrant a typical AAA full game price.  However, there is a ton of content already in the Steam Workshop (some 700 new tracks the last time I looked) and these are seamlessly integrated with the game's 'Arcade' mode, plus the infinite possibilities of randomly seeded tracks, you'll never be bored.  As far as multiplayer goes, it seems really popular but check the game forums (I don't play multiplayer so I can't offer comment on this).  As a single-player product though, Steam reviews are giving an ""overwhelmingly positive"" for a very good reason: it really IS a great game already.  If you enjoy Wipeout-style games and not troubled by a lack of AI racers, then this should definitely be in your collection - it's worthy even as an Early Access title.Highly recommended!			"

								Distance is one of those few racing games that feel really unique. There is normal racing, wall jumping, no gravity, flying & jumping. These are all ways for you to finish the different tracks (And there are a lot due to a good community), many tracks have more than one way to finish the race, and sometimes one of the options might be better, other times it's the same or just up to your skill. The game offer a few different game modes, spring which is normal racing, go from start to end, you can respawn if you fail and so on. The other is challenge, it's like sprint but shorter and no respawn, so prepare to fail quite a lot. There is also stunt, the least attractive game mode this far, where you are just suppose to do different stunts to gather a high score. There is also a multiplayer only game mod with the name ""Tag"" or something like that.Tag works like the classic child game where one or more are chasing the others trying to ""tag"" them, however here it's the other way around, everyone is chasing the one with the forcefield, and you win when you've held the ""tag"" for three minutes. Quite fun. The car is customizable when it comes to colours, I do hope they add more customization though, since it's always a plus. But for a early access game this game works really well! It never crashes unless you've tabbet it for quite some time. All maps have a high score screen where you are not only competing against your old record, but also against all other players who play this game. I would love if they added something like Trials where you can see how the different players have been driving, because sometimes you do suspect cheating.I really recommend this, one of my best buys this year!

								Have had this game since December 2014 (When it first went into early access). Distance has more polish to it now than most Triple A games out nowadays, and it's very impressive considering it's not even done! Best and most functional Early Access game I've owned or seen on Steam.With Distance, the main game mode is getting to the end of a track as fast as possible. Some levels can be scenic, and others can be a ride through hell, but it's insanely fun regardless. Slick visuals, tight controls, and metric butt tons of community content to go through and download (I have 500+ levels downloaded so far!). The level editor is incredibly deep and allows for tons of creative levels to be made.As it is Early Access, the adventure mode isn't complete but will be when the full game comes out sometime soon.I don't regret grabbing this at all since it's been basically fully functional for over a year! It only gets better with every update. 10/10			"

								Incredibly polished for an Early Access title. It gets difficult very quickly, but in Adventure mode there's no penalty for failing, you just restart at a checkpoint and try again. The additional Arcade mode, where you compete against others for the best score, time, or a combination of both, along with the user created levels, means there's almost infinite replayability. The graphics are gorgeous, as you can see in the screenshots above, and the soundtrack is incredibly well integrated with the action (although there's also the option for a custom soundtrack - which I have not tried - if you get bored with thumping techno). The sound effects are also really well done. The ""whoosh"" as you pass an obstacle really adds to the sense of speed. Well worth buying for anyone looking for a different type of racing game.			"

								I imagine if you are reading this review you know already that Distance is a futuristic racing game.  A lot of the time you will be racing flat out, that is until your boost begins to overheat which cools at the next regeneration point.  You also get to jump obstacles, fly and wall/ceiling ride.  The game requires a high-level of skill and concentration, especially on some of the tougher levels!

The devs have included a track editor which mean there are around 1350 tracks at this present moment, and remember this game is still in Early Access!!  Not that you can tell this is a beta, it has the functionaly of a finished product and is extremely rich with features.One planned feature not yet implemented that I'm most excited about are replays!  The game, as you can probably tell from video and screenshots looks absolutely gorgeous.  To have the ability to watch back (hopefully from external views!) a race in replay mode will be divine!  The engine appears extremely optimised and on my i5/970 runs extremely smooth, not even the smallest sign that any component is breaking a sweat!The current campaign is quite short but also acts as a tutorial or introduction to the various moves at your disposal.  Although it is short it is extremely fun and very atmospheric.  The lighting rythmically flashing in time to  the dark techno pounding out your speakers and the weird static effects hurtling you through the environment really create for a highly enjoyable experience.  They are still adding to the campaign, but it's so fun I've replayed it a few times.You've also got leaderboards, online play, time/score challenges to keep you more than occupied.One problem I had initially was with the controls when attempting to switch surfaces to drive on.  Using the control pad to switch from floor to wall for example meant using the left and then right analoge sticks.  Previously this was my only apprehension about the game.  After perusing the forums a couple of other players recommended to switch the controls to advanced mode.  Now this frightened me a little!!  The game requires enough skill as it is without adding to it!!  Advanced mode meant that I now only have to use the left analoge stick to wall-ride.  So I can steer, jump off the road and then use the left analogue stick again to adjust my angle in the air to meet the wall.  Previously movement in the air would've been with the right stick and it felt extremely unintuitive.  Maybe this information can help someone else too.Full release is planned for later this year.  There's really no reason to wait, the game is an absolute stack of fun and a dream to look at.  Sci-fi racing at its best!!			"

								Well, I clocked over 600 hours on this game and I can tell you that it's very fun & addictive because there's many levels from the official ones to the custom-made ones. The level editor is very good because it allows you to use your creativity freely. You can also choose game modes from Sprint (the most used one) to Reverse Tag (battle style but with tag rules) or play Adventure Mode, which can be both fun and creepy at certain times. The devs are great because they listen & communicate to the community and add suggested features to the game.Pros:+ Great gameplay+ Great level editor variety+ Great communication with the communityCons:None that I think of.Overall, definitely buy this game if you are a arcade racing fan!

The community is amazing and the game isn't even finished yet. It's able to create atmospheres of futuristic and dystopian environments extremely well. Jumping around doing crazy tricks, dodging obstacles at high speeds and making the tricky track switches is still very rewarding.If you love driving cars, beautiful environments, and crazy high speed tricks and flips, get Distance. :D			"

								Distance is the perfect blend between a racing and a platforming experience. It reminds me of the classic Trackmania which I loved. It is really addictive trying to master a track by shaving off fractions of a second on every corner or just doing crazy stunts while avoiding over-the-top obstacles. Here is my experience with the Beta...Driving: Responsive, arcade controls for driving, jumping and flying. The game works well with a gamepad and provides sensible layouts for many controllers. It would be nice to have a button to reset the camera though. I like the way the car handles mid-air maneuvering. Sometimes collisions with obstacles can feel a little bit off. I also wish there were more obstacles that you can interact with, like the lasers - how about destructible surfaces or gravity fields?Aesthetics: The world looks like it was partly inspired by things like Tron, but feels much more gritty. It features impressive lighting effects and a great soundtrack. You can get an amazing sense of speed through the visual and sound effects, combined with the track design.Story Mode: A good way to get accustomed to the controls and obstacles, as it has a very nice learning curve. It sets the mood with some awesome set-piece moments that don't feel tacked on.Tracks: The track you choose determines if you are playing a race against the clock (Sprint), a hardcore platformer (Challenge), a Tony Hawk-like playground (Stunt) or all at once (Speed & Style - my favorite). The various tracks often allow multiple paths which require some skilled driving and creativity while making split-second decisions. If you get off-track, there is usually a way to recover. The ability to make your own tracks in the editor or download community ones gives this game longevity. Multiplayer: I have not tried the different multiplayer modes yet but I am eager to get into it now that the game is on Early Access.			"

								You start off playing a very innovative and unique (in my experience at least) racing game. As you continue you notice that it is incredibly well polished for an early-access game, and could very easily be confused for a finished product. What's this? You can add your own tunes to the game and activate something called ""Boombox"" mode. Neat!It is at this point that you realize during your lesiurely drive somebody has slipped you some very bad ganja. But that's all well-and-good, because even though you're dodging neon buzzsaws and freaking lasers, your co-pilot squirrel Mr. Nutters is pumping your favorite phat beats into your pulsating cranium and any real danger can be easily dismissed from high up in your flying car.

								""Overwhelmingly Postivie"" and deseriving. I've never seen so much done with a racing game before. A slew of insanely creative mechanics, beautifully futuristic landscapes, and awesome controls. There's everything from a twisted contored labrynth of death traps, to flying in zero gravity, and even a psuedo-jumpscare somehow- that's all in just the campaign (which isnt even done yet!). The devs are updating constantly and alongside the campagin is an arcade mode with several deep modes inside all in coop, single player, or online. Great slew of options and customization too. If this is the future of racing games I want to be a part of it. Highly Recommended			"

								TL;DR: Awesome game for a decent price with graphics that're way better than the screenshots above make them look. Buy it YESTERDAY, but don't expect a super-realistic driving game or even a MARGINALLY realistic one. I don't even think the cars have breaks--but if they do I've never used them.A pretty unique game that feels less like a driving or racing game(due in large part to the slippery and unrealistic car) and more like a sort-of... Sonic-y runner with survival elements. Irregardless of how the game feels however it is inarguably one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. The game is challenging at times but for the most part is very fair, even in most of the workshop levels I've played, and it introduces a pretty cool universe(though one which reminds me too much of Tron to call it wholly original) that I REALLY want to learn more about, as well as some mechanics that I can't really say I've ever seen before.You'll find yourself frequently and seamlessly switching from driving on the ceiling and on the walls, only to jump off two and a half seconds later and flying over an endless void. After a while, you'll land on solid ground again-- and if the planets align, you'll be actually horizontal on the GROUND and not on a wall or the ceiling, and nothing will be trying to kill you. At which point you'll probably make your car JUMP and do a couple flips for bonus points. This is the game's biggest asset, in my opinion. Everything just works--and works so very, very well. Jumping from a walll to the floor or vice-versa has some occasional hiccups, but otherwise the physics engine is constructed so well that the game just FLAWLESSLY and instantaneously responds to your commands in a way that I'm too illiterate to describe. The controls just feel so right... I'd even call them close to flawless. When you're a car, it drives like a car--a car that can jump, flip, and drive when half of it gets shredded by laser beams, but a car nonetheless. When you leap into the air and deploy your ♥♥♥♥ing WINGS, it feels like a plane. The game instantly transitions from a really solid(but floaty and weightless) arcade driving game into a really solid flight simulator--but it does it so well that you don't even notice most of the time.Another huge plus is the striking art style. It feels reminiscent of Tron, but it has its own unique flare that defines it as its own, like most of the rest of the game does. It looks really overly shiny and neon and it's not something that I'm usually very fond of, but it works REALLY well. The screenshots and footage on this page seriously do not do the game credit in this respect.The obsticles in the game are also pretty awesome, in combination with the car's damage model. Imagine Metal Gear Rising where Raiden's sword is a grid of laser beams, and you are the watermellon. Obviously your car does not like to drive as well if it is split in half, but it can take a lot of abuse as I recall.The lore and universe in the game gives me mixed opinions. The developers have made it clear that they'll probably change a lot of the ""story"", but as of the time of this writing the game has a really solid universe and what seems to be the beginning of some AMAZING lore to build off of, but it doesn't really do anything with it. It attempts to almost tell the story through the tracks as you race through them, and while it translates pretty well in some ways, it doesn't really allow you to get a good idea of where you are, why you're there, and what the hell is going on around you, and it certainly leaves you drawing blanks for specific details. Story is by no means of any importance in a game like this and when the tracks are designed so well that they should make AAA publishers feel inferior, I really don't mind too much, but I simply can't help but lust for more lore. Hell, I'll sebtle for a two-issue tie-in comic for god's sake.In conclusion, the game has its faults, but I'll be damned if I can name any of them. I'm too busy trying to beat my backflip record.In a car.			"

								I can't really describe the feeling I have while playing Distance and I don't do much reviews of games so it's gonna be a bit clumsy.Anyway. Let's list the awesome points :- Excellent EDM music that puts you into the action and the race like nothing can do. (Unlike in the previous game, Nitronic Rush (which I recommend too), you don't have the ""interactive"" music where it does some more sounds & notes when you jump : I personnaly liked that a lot but I can understand that it's not added in this game)- Intense speed sensation when in fullscreen and with the right setup.- A tight gameplay that will challenge your skills and reflexes, I think that's one of the most interesting gameplays I had on a race game. You get the fiber really fast and once you have it : badass race at every corner.- The decor (mostly in space) really matches with the music and the speed : combining colors and speed brings you into a psychedelic experience that is really enjoyable and made me feel a bit of that 90s vibe I got in Nitronic Rush.EDM, Speed and Space what can we ask more to have a badass experience ?Now let's list some of the bad points that could be improved : - More content (like the story). But you know that's the principle of a game where you put passion : forever getting better. And I don't doubt they put passion in it.I sincerely don't have anything bad to say about it because I know that with time things that are missing will get implemented. Full confidence into the dev-team.Freaking buy it my dude.			"

Most entertaining racing game I've ever played and I'm not really a big fan of racing games but I keep coming back to this one. Highest replay value I've ever seen for a racing game, once you start learning how to master the controls of your car you'll start finding unconventional alternate routes you can take on most tracks that make you think outside of the box and makes for a really fun adventure.

It's [Beep]ing awesome.-It gives you a lot of control over the visual flashiness of the game. [Stylized Outlines on/off, Vignetting on/off, neon bloom on/off, Etc.]-Since it allows you to adjust the steering sensitivity on-the-fly, you can just as effectively play on a keyboard as you can on a gamepad.Cons:-If your computer isn't above-average, you probably won't be able to set the graphics very high [but in my opinion it looks fine anyway.]-The online community is nearly nonexistant, and when you DO find a server, it's either private, full, ongoing or for some reason you can't connect properly. However this game is entertaining enough in single player anyway.-On the rare occation you get into an online lobby just fine, it's almost definitely going to be a track that's nearly impossible to beat.

First of all, should you buy it? Hell yes!Great concept, nice and smooth gameplay, amazing community an quiet beginner-friendly. There are some official maps, but tons of community created stuff which is really nice and challenging. The game itself is like a mixture of Trackmania, Rocket League and SAMP DD/DM Servers. The only actual goal is to finish the map in the fastest way.Since it's still not complete there are of course things you could still add, like achievements or something else to unlock, custom vehicles, tuning parts or a money system to buy these cars (which don't exist, yet). So far, you have 1 car model which you can't modify except some color options and ranking lists (Current Party, local, friends, global).Beside this, the music fits in really well and isn't getting boring after a few hours of playing. But if it does so, you still have to possibility to add your personal music straight into the game.The price of 20€ is very okey, too but for 10€ on sales it's definitely worth it! The game may still be in progress but you can play it already perfectly fine with nearly no bugs at all./Edit: One negative thing is, that there don't really come updates...			"

								I don't really know how to feel about Distance. It's not a bad game at all, but having owned it for the year it's been in early access, I was expecting more to be added I guess. I bought it wanting to see where it would go, and it hasn't really gone anywhere. It was kind of already done when it came out.I've had this for a year and all that's really been added is tweaking/bug fixes, workshop optimization, and new stuff for the level editor.There hasn't really been anything major that's been added. All I can think of is a cockpit view and some new camera angles. And the ability to change how bright and intense the visual effects are. No new cars, no real customization like tricking out your ride, no new modes, no new mechanics. It's fun but you're just paying for community made content honestly. That's where the bread and butter is.It's kind of like Trials Evolution in terms of base game + insane community created content. Only that game was finished when it was released. I guess I was just expecting this game to grow a lot more than it has.I wish there was a neutral option. It's a fine game, but my own disappointment due to my expectations has made me not want to recommend it. Maybe this will change when it's released. I guess judging it solely from a vanilla experience the answer is no.Update December 2016: It's still gone nowhere.			"

								For the record, I got this game recently. Not because anyone recommended it to me, but i stumbled upon it and thought. ""hey. what the heck. looks cool"". I couldn't have been more wrong.This game is more than good. It's Absolutely Outstanding.From the moment I started the game I was greeted by disclaimers saying it was an early access game and may change. and to report bugs if I saw any. Off to the main menu I went and by goodness was I surprised on all the features it has!You can change the graphics to black light, film grain. shell shaded. <- (which is my personal favorite) and you have a feature to pretty much bass boost your game into completely shaking the maps. which is. Let me tell you. Just the best.My first few tries at racing were. pitiful to say the least. But wait.. racing would mean you have competition? In this game really the only competition is you. and multiplayer have you, but you feel so compelled to do better. to get gold.. (i've seen diamond but i'm just not that good yet) and I have to say that even though it's been years since i've played a racing game. I find this game to be one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had. There is so much fluidity with all the functions of your car. and learning about them and hell. even mastering them makes you feel like a badass.This game's artstyle is to die for. but the best part about this is that the music. dynamically changes the maps. not in obstacles or things it throws at you. but Interacting with certain colors. pulsing. and it's mesmerizing to say the least and albeit very distracting that it becomes an obstacle some in itself (not a bad thing mind you) and to top it all off it has VR support and you can add custom music, user made tracks. and even play splitscreen. all in an early access game.TL:DR Please buy this game. You will not regret it. It has something for everyone. <- i bought this game 1 day prior to this review. and haven't dropped it since.			"

								EDIT: I'm editing this review to say this truly is one of the best racing games I've played in a looooooong time.  This may even be my favorite racer of 2014 (Although, to be fair, there weren't too many racers in 2014). The track editor seems really confusing to me, but apparently not to others because the tracks on workshop are ridiculous. Also, 3 hours may not seem like a lot of time for this game, but considering the short ""campaign,"" most of it is workshop levels. Of course, keep in mind this is still an EA game and there are bugs (like being able to take advantage of flight and skip entire portions of track) but overall this is a fun, refreshing game. Disclaimer: I came into the game with absolutely no expectations. I had never heard of the studio or the previous game.Summary: Distance is a game that's reminicent of a combination of Trackmania and the Hotwheels stunt games. Even in this state, it's very polished. My one complaint thus far is the lack of content, however, like Trackmania, this game offers a full fledged track editor even this early in development. If you like survival racing games but you're concerned of the shortness of the campaign, wait until the full launch. If you like the aformented but enjoy creating content yourself/playing other player's content, just get this now.Gameplay: The gameplay consists of survival racing, where you manuever your car around obstacles and flip the car to reach other surfaces. Very fast paced and fluid. Only complaint thus far is sometimes it felt like the car flipped too slowly, but it's minor. Also want to note the attention to detail here. When a lazer cuts the car in half, it actually feels like that half is missing and the car is considerably harder to drive.Graphics: Game looks pretty nice even now. There are more graphical options than most AAA titles that come to PC. Optimization is okay right now. On a 760, 3770, and 8GB of RAM, I'm getting 30-60 fps.Story: There is a story, but frankly I skipped the cutscenes.			"

This game gives me an anxiety attack as I try to beat the levels. I got so high and couldn't stop freaking out to the music. This game is perfect. Get ♥♥♥♥ed up then play this game.			"

								What would you get if you got F-Zero, added the ability to jump and fly, allowed you to go off track, and made it look like tron?  You would get Distance.  Distance is a game where you have to drive, and fly, through a winding track.  This is one of the best racing games I have ever played.  But I will have to warn you that the controls for flight are very clunky.			"

								Distance is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Robot Car on your journey through a strange city like landscape who's roads just so happen to make a sick race trap. Robot Car was speed through the city, avoiding danger, harrowing death traps, hostile defense systems, and a strange alien entity hell bent on destroying Robot Car.So it's basically Brave Little Toaster, only faster. Distance is a driving game where your main objective is to reach the end of the map as fast as possible without crashing or slowing down, the faster you go, the better your time ends up being. There is also a story mode where you have to go through a long gauntlet of tracks, but as of writing this review, the story mode isn't 100% completed.Each track takes the form of a long street filled with twists, turns, loops, and traps, and your car has all of the abilities necessary to reach the finish line without turning into that strange red substance I find on my mattress. You have turbo, jump, flight mode, the ability to descend quicker, and wall/ceiling riding. Much like the clothing I steal from the back of goodwill trucks, the controls in this game are tight. Taking corners, drifting, flight, and jumps all feel satisfying and easy to pull off. There's nothing more satisfying than going full speed from wall to cieling to floor to wall to floor without slipping or crashing into the wall like a drunk suburban girl who can totally hold on to that mechanical bull. Distance's biggest bonus is it's multiplayer. Not only can you race others for best time, but there's a workshop in place where other players can upload the maps they made. These maps range from stinky maps that suck to maps that put all the tracks in the main game to shame. Some times you're tested to the limits of your skill as the creator throws everything he can think of at you without making it impossible. Should you play Distance?Yeah, probably, do what you want, I'm not your dad. Distance is fun, fast, thrilling, and basically everything I want in my outrageous action games. Refract Studios, the developers of Distance also made another survival racing game called Nitronic Rush, which you can get for free off their website if you want a taste as to what you might get in Distance. I'd check that out too, because it's also pretty rad.Length gets 8 walls popping out of nowhere and you're going too fast to react on time out of 10. According to JK Rowling, wizards are constantly crapping in their pants. Multibillion dollar franchise here, folks.

								Distance. Named so, because that is the challange. Getting from point A to B. But really, so much more than that. Sure, you could say that time is the challange, or that it's other players in multiplayer, but really, it's yourself.This game... I don't even know where to start. It's AMAZING. Most car-based games I've played are limited to racing, and driving on the GROUND. In this game, what even IS the ground? Sure, there's gravity, (most of the time) but you can drive freely on any flat or flat-ish surface you can get to. This game has NO invisible walls, no limits.Most games in Early Access are unfinished shadows of what they could be, lacking most gameplay, and just a proof of concept. This game is in a state that they could release it from beta, and it could be considered finished. Years of work have been put into this game, and I'm glad to have played it before it offically came out on steam. The game has a level editor, and while it IS a bit tricky to use, it's limitless with what you can do. It has Workshop support, which means you have 100's more levels than the developers could make in the time they have. Already I've seen some pretty cool levels.  I've seen levels that look like Tron, and levels that looks like natural mountions. My SINGLE complaint is the sorting system for the levels. They should have a way to sort from most recently updates, by name, and a few other things.Over all, 10/10. This is NO exaggeration.			"

								I have put over 500 hours into Distance at this point, and I thought it would be a good idea to give it the review it deserves. I eagerly awaited early access, having been introduced to Nitronic Rush by one of my coworkers. My first playthough of the adventure mode left me stunned; in its incomplete state I still felt that I had just experienced a Portal game for the first time.Adventure mode ramps up the difficulty nicely, teaching you the skills you will need in multiplayer. After cutting your teeth on adventure mode, there are hundreds of community levels available on the workshop, and this is where the game is played. After earning a gold medal on all the official levels, and sampling the best that the workshop has to offer, it's time to start publishing your own levels. I've made six levels to date, and I have a seventh in works.The Distance community is also extremely friendly and easy going :D "

								Got this on sale, spent 9.99 EUR, worth it.I just finished the so-called ""Adventure"" mode, which is a tutorial and ~10 levels with (mostly) increasing difficulty.After watching a few videos and being 80 minutes into this game I can say this is something good, something new. Something cool. The music fits the gameplay.Briefly, this is Tron, TrackMania, Blur and Death Race mixed up all against you.I haven't already tried, but as far as I can see, there are several types of multiplayer modes (add Rocket League to the mix), including soccer... One thing I fear that knocking opponents into the void is disabled.Good stuff.Can I recommend it with two thumbs up?			"

								Incredibly fun. The game is as great as it looks and is surprisingly well polished for a beta. I wouldn't have even thought it was a beta if I hadn't seen a message at the start saying so. The only thing's still missing is the remainder of the missions in the Adventure mode.There are no timers which you have to beat and no other cars to race against (unless in specific game modes). For the most part the game requires you to traverse and survive the level which throws a variety of obstacles at you, such as looping roads, lasers, moving saw blades, ramps, flying sections, and so on. Add in the stunning visuals and nice music and you have an awesome high-speed sci-fi driving game.There's plenty of content. Adventure mode has you go through the official 'main story' levels, which get gradually harder and introduce you to new challenges each time. Then there is also a level editor (which I've not explored thoroughly yet) and plenty of community-made levels to try out. And if that's not enough, there's a feature called Trackmogrify, where you type in a random word or anything else and it generates a race track based on it using some sort of seed generator. You can literally type in anything. Just whack random letters and numbers in and see what comes up.I particularly enjoyed the nice little touches, such as the car receiving very visible damage from the obstacles, like laser beams cutting parts of it off or even slicing it in half and the car still going. There seems to be an enormous attention to detail.Only thing I am not too fond of at the moment are the parts where you have to jump and land onto sideways or upside down roads as it feels pretty clunky and requires absolute precision to get right, especially when a level chains up 2 or more of such parts within a short distance. Is it unfair? Most times no. But it can get very frustrating, because it creates a sudden difficulty spike in the level and causes you to die again and again and feel like you're not making any progress. In essence, the learning curve for those sections is very steep, even though they're very much doable.Overall this is a great game. I would highly recommend it for those who enjoy some high speed challenge.			"

I'm really happy that I stumbled upon this game, and knowing that it was created by the people who created Nitronic Rush, I bought it hoping for another expreience like it.Turns out, even though I have only played it for an hour (as of writing this) it still has the same magic that Nitronic had. I really like the feel of the game, it feels more dark and mysterious than the first game, and it makes it feel even better. Its a visual treat, and it looks and feels amazing.-ProsCustomizable controls (HUGE improvement over the original game)Custom color schemes for vehiclesWorkshopTrack design is incredible and creative like the first gameThe story in this game feels more like a story compared to the first gameCustom musicTrack editorAnd so much more....-ConsThe wall jumps. I've hated those with a burning passion since the first game. You get used to it after a while though. So, its not too bad.It really amazes me how much this game takes from NR, and I really hope to see that same expreience in this game as well further down the road.			"

								This game is fookin awesome for a completely finished game.  The only thing is... its still early access...  Yea, think about that for a second...  How many games (ever created) can claim something like that.  My PC hasnt had an upgrade in a few years and it still runs this flawlessly.  Graphics: kicks♥♥♥♥♥  Music: kicks♥♥♥♥♥  Every track I've played kicks♥♥♥♥♥  Loading Time:  Shorter than an ADD kids attention span.  Race track?  Screw that, I'm going to outer space.  See you at the finish line whenever the hell I feel like!Also, Im not sure why, but I *really* like the way the items on the course blink with the sound tracks.  And the very nice transitioning of music between segments and courses (and when you crash and burn).So far I have only downloaded one community track but it was just as good as the ones that came with the game originally.  I tried the map editor for only a few minutes so far just to see what it was like.  Honetly, it's going to take a lot more time to get comfortable with the massive amounts of tools at your disposal in there.  But that is a good thing, I think.Im not completely sure at this time, but I think I read someone else mention there are only 6 people making this game or something.  If that number is even close, I have to salute these guys.  Amazing quality!Im not just giving this a thumbs up, Im recommending it to anyone I know that likes racing games and will be gifting it to a few people for Christmas for sure.  I am definitely looking forward to where this game is headed and I am glad to have been an early supporter.  Thanks fellas, and keep up the good work! "

An amazing editor with all assets included and thousands of tracks available free from the community right now.I don\'t want to spoil anything, suffice it to say arcade style racing, single, split screen or online with global leaderboards. Some really inventive driving options, including the ablity to jump/fly/boost, ride walls etc. Your car sticks to the track like glue, not a lot of drift ability at this time. Some crazy obstacles with stunning effects.....you/'ll see....Get it on sale it\'s worth it. Entrepeneurial Option: Get the game, throw a Rave at your house, use the level editor to play the music through a stereo and charge 10$ a head to get in. Voila, you\'re rich!			"

When you race, you can 95% of the time just spam the speed-boost making the drive button useless.All in all 9/10 fun racing game, AMAZING mechanics and feel complete aside from content.

Early Access Review
								Very artistic and quirky style game with heavy leaning towards fast arcade style action on wheels. Almost like TRON in terms of visual style. The techno soundtrack adds a very definite atmosphere and style that will propably either help you either hate or like this. I personally am mixed how to feel about this, I like the style and innovation, and for me the techno is no real deal breaker either, it adds to the genre. But there is something in this game that gives me an unnerving feeling. The levels are innovative but somehow it just does not feel enough in terms of longetivity or variety. And by longetivity I mean not how many tracks there are but the repetition gameplay wise. It never evolves beyond that. This is a bit like wipeout was on ps1 but somehow that game for me was more fun and entertaining than this one. This game looks and sounds really cool but I'm not really feeling it. Also there is this weird vibe to the general feeling of the game. Wipeout had this upbeat positive vibe. This feels like the opposite somehow. These are propably a matter of personal preference. I still recommend trying this one out. It's definitely either a love or hate type of game depending on your preference. I'm not really delving in to the details of this game because theres enough coverage of that. I just add my 2 cents in which is more about the way games make me feel, good or bad. This one gets a mixed reception.			"

								Quality of early access game:Very high, the devs keep adding content and have the game already very polished from the get-go so you don't feel ripped off that it took them forever to finish the game.This game has full workshop support!Glitches:To be honest, it already feels like a finished game, it just has a few glitches here or there that are mostly User interface.There IS currently a very obnoxious part of the game where you have to go to the workshop > collections > all collections and subscribe to all of them so the people hosting the multiplayer games can host pretty much anything.This is the result of the fact that downloading host maps in-game is currently not possible.Have you played Nitronic Rush?Yes? Then this is a better, faster, more polished version of that with multiplayer, fun new gametypes and the best damn level editor you've ever used.Haven't played Nitronic Rush?Distance is an (currently as of writing this) unfinished early access racing game by the digipen grads that made Nitronic Rush as their capstone project.Gameplay: You drive a car that seems to be a mix of an electronic sports car and a jet pack, as the car itself can not only fly but also has small thrusters on every section of the vehicle which are 100% necessary as the roads will end suddenly and this forces the player to literally jump, spin, and twist to another track section. The controls are tight and feel satisfying when you pull off a trick or make a perfect landing.It's about going fast and avoiding MANY obstacles, which can range from pretty much anything and everything. If you get hit by a laser the game will remove parts of your vehicle realistic, and you can keep going to try and rebuild at the next checkpoint, it's often hilarious!Graphics:wow, just wow. The game is absolutely beautiful. I haven't seen such amazing reflection (specular) mapping on anything in video games in, ever. The game has some CRAZY filters and lighting that results in areas having feeling to them. I.E. a VIBRANT red area that is very in your face with it's obstacles will make you tense up and concentrate as you dodge as much as you can. While a cool blue zone, even if it has more obstacles, might make the game feel a bit more relaxed.Even in multiplayer the game is very atmospheric, allowing creators of custom maps to be extremely creative.Story?There IS a story, it's very abstract. Not as in it's trying to be artsy, instead it goes for a more vague, mysterious and atmospheric feel. Without spoiling anything, I think you'll enjoy the story if you like video games that don't shove the story down your throat. Do keep in mind, as it is early access, the story is not currently complete and only has about ten levels. Which will actually take you a good hour or so to complete them all, much longer if it's your first time playing it. Multiplayer: Yes, it has multiplayer. Currently players cannot collide with each-other. Instead every player shows up as a real-time ghost, which surprisingly doesn't actually make the game less fun.There are a few issues here or there unfortunately, as the physics for the game are connected to the frames-per-second, you may collide with walls or pieces of track even though you thought you landed just fine. Do keep in mind this has happened to me only two times in the over a hundred multiplayer races I’ve driven.The other game modes are pretty fun too, reverse tag is just a big game of keep-away, It's pretty fun, and results in some silly moments.Difficulty:This game is has a very subtle difficulty curve. It starts off easy and explains mechanics as you go by, then it gets surprisingly difficult. When you finally get used to the difficulty of the game it semi-mellows out to the point of making it easier but still challenging. Once you get good at it, you'll start trying new shortcuts and attempt tricks to skip parts of tracks. The custom maps however range from incredibly easy, to insane in how difficult they are. If you get a large amount of them and play with some people (or friends if you have those) you'll have a blast.Conclusion:Distance is fun, REALLY fun. It breaks many of the assumptions we have for racing games and makes the game feel fresh and new with it's style and feel of originality. It's very atmospheric, and that personally is very appealing. The addition of multiplayer and custom map support is genius and makes the game feel fresh almost indefinitely. It may not be finished but it sure feels like a complete game at this point. 9.5/10 One of my new favorite games. Can't wait for them to finish it!P.S. If you want to have a demo for this game, Nitronic Rush is the best way to do that, it's free; just Google it.			"

								This game is super good.There's not much of a story of to it yet, so to speak. In a nutshell: You're a car, and♥♥♥♥♥♥got ♥♥♥♥ed up somehow, so you have to un♥♥♥♥ it by driving really fast. And that's about it because early access.Gameplay wise, it's solid. You have two sticks, two triggers, and two buttons. Fairly simple, but then you learn you can drive on walls by jumping onto them, and it's really rather good. You can also fly, and that opens up a whole world of opportunity for track skips.Graphically it's pretty good as well, so yeah.The soundtrack is exactly what you'd expect from this sort of game: Lots of EDM and dubstep. And surprisingly, it works. However, if that's not your thing, then you can play your own music so that's good too.But what's really, really, super good about this game, is that the developers put in a random track function, which generates fairly short tracks to race around based on a seed you put in. This essentially turns the game into the video game equivalent of potato chips: You start with just one, and then you do another, and then next thing you know it's two hours down the line and you've eaten the whole bag.And the workshop's pretty good too I guess.Overall 9/10.

You not only race, but you roll on twisting roads, right walls, race on ceilings, and even fly.. There are so many things that can slice you in half it's crazy! Car sliced in half? Survived it without flying off the track? Do you best to get to a checkpoint. It'll regenerate you.. Trying to get there is hilariously fun though!Bottom line, if you're bored and don't mind spending $20, GET THIS GAME! You won't be dissappointed!*There's an online option and an editor for tracks on there. I'd avise those with experience in graphics programs to try this out as the editor is very very detailed. You can do a TON with the editor :)			"

Now you are driving upside down on a spiral and wants you to kick off the wall, flip over and land on a wall parallel. Then from that point another portal and then you are at the top of the map. No gravity. Go through another and you are going straight down..through a grid of lasers and saw blades""Beautiful. Just.. Wonderful. Refract Studios. Give us More. "

								Even though Distance has won other awards, ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" and thus have nominated it so. I mean, come on. Lasers n'Tron style car parkour, flying, awesome community levels, and it still has a story mode coming out soon. The devs and community are also wicked awesome, so if you haven't yet, try this game out. Definitely worth it			"

								If you want to know what this game is like, compare it to a combination of:  F-Zero, Star Fox, Portal, and Rocket League. To me, this game seems awfully similar to the old Hot Wheels Acceleracers (in terms of just about everything), which was my absolute favorite movie series when I was younger. I had always imagined what type of game Acceleracers could be made into, and Distance, by far, exceeded my expectations.10/10 A dream turned into reality :D "

								Really fun and addictive little game, especially for being in beta. Some of the user tracks are a little iffy, with questionable layouts (there was walljump where the wall you're jumping to was bending away from you, which was no small annoyance, and another where you basically had to jump off the track, deploy wings, and then land back on the track slightly later because the walljump clearance was so small that you literally couldn't spin your car around unless it was perfect), but there are some good ones if you're willing to do some digging. Also, it plays your music for you, and since the devs have expressed an interest in increasing mod support (the way I understood it, at least), this is only gonna get better. As far as value for money goes, $22 CAD is a decent price if you like this genre of racing game, but I'd still recommend holding out for a Steam sale if one is reasonably close at hand.			"

								The game is great.To start off the game is atmosperic with its abandoned, futuristic world. the gameplay is great and allows many approches to a problem. For instance one time I was playing a level and there was obsticles I couldn't find a route through so i flew over them. That bring up another point, this game is hard, but it is managibly hard. Respawns are quick and you are always close to your faliures. If you are finding something too hard you can play one of the many other challenges and there is alot of content, from pre-made levels to community levels and even the trackmogrify tracks. The game's level editor is good, if you can use it but it can be challenging to make levels if it's your first time.The only big promlem, that is still small, is that the framerate does sometimes drop.overall it is great with alot of content.

								Distance is a very high-speed and reflex-intensive racing game. It's still in Early Access, but the experience (in my opinion) is already extremely satisfying. It's the kind of game you can play for 5 minutes or for hours on end. Currently, there isn't a whole lot of official content, but the amount of community maps is absurd, and most of them are amazing. For now, the (still in progress) story mode serves as a kind of tutorial which runs you through the official maps.When you go online, there usually aren't many (or any) hosts, yet invariably, within ~3 minutes of hosting your own server, people will quickly begin to join. I don't know why people are reluctant to host matches, but they're there, and ""if you host it, they will join."" Furthermore, the community is friendly and helpful.This game is perfect to get your mind off of things, as you'll quickly be engrossed in the satisfying mechanics/gameplay. It has a strange ability to demand your attention, present you with mass chaos and intense gameplay, yet somehow be very relaxing at the same time. I've never been big on racing games, but I wholeheartedly recommend this game for people who have a need for speed and people who love skill & reflex-based games  "

A gripe only.  It's 20 bucks.  A bit much for this, but honestly, it's barely even a con.  This is really cool.			"

								Let me start by saying that I absolutely loved Nitronic Rush, a college project made by Refract before they were, uh, Refract. Nitronic Rush was basically Distance except with a different story, car, graphics, and music. Now the car mechanincs were exactly the same, this is obviously a good idea for Refract to do. I really liked the way Music played a big role in Nitronic Rush and it sorta does in Distance, though not as much. I can't tell if I miss the narrator from Nitronic Rush or not, it was pretty funny to hear him narrate all the tricks you did. (""Holy Teledo!""   ""Sad Day!"") Moving on, Distance is truly a unique and wonderful game, posing a challenge and new gameplay style. I haven't seen many ""Survival Racing Games"" Before, and Distance is a good one. Everything Feels really smooth and the levels are satisfying and Challenging at the same time, not to mention that multiplayer is a lot of fun. Even though the Adventure mode is really short, I can guarantee that you will have endless play time. This is because the game has a level editor, and ""Trackmogrify"", which is an element where you enter a word or phrase, and it generates a track for you to play. The VR support looks nice and any new updates I can expect to be just as good. But this game, it is worth it, but do give Nitronic Rush a go, it's free!      http://nitronic-rush.com/P.S: Nitronic Rush Gives more of an Arcade Racer, while Distance is more Serious, but both retain a huge amount of fun!

								A neon-style Trackmania with VR support. I bought the game a long time ago but never realized it has full VR support but as I got my HTC Vive and played the game in VR again I had a blast!It runs really smooth (most tracks with stable 90+ FPS), looks stunning and it has a lot of content due to the workshop support and all tracks can be played in VR which is really awesome and so much fun! The soundtrack is good as well and some light effects in the game are synced to the music which makes it look and feel even better.Anyway you could get a bit nausea on some tracks in VR. I didn't have problems with motion sickness in any other game yet but sometimes I felt like I have to stop playing after a while and driving intense tracks.Distance is my favourite seated VR game yet and if you own a Vive or Oculus and you like games like Trackmania I can only recommend to buy it!

								Tron, mixed with the ability to race or fly at almost any time, seemless teleportation through warp gates, some damn awesome community made maps, Variety of game modes, although Sprint with 5 of your best mates is likely to be the most popular and heavily played. The ability to jump onto walls and drive on the ceiling, defy gravity, pull crazy stunts and drive with half a car after recklessly driving through a laser grid is just pure awesome. Most tracks have various routes that can be taken, shortcuts that are filled with dangerous traps but are all the more satisfying as you weave, fly and boost your way through those hectic shortcuts to leave your rivals in the dust. It is still in early access, meaning the adventure mode is yet to be fully completed, however bugs and glitches seem to be quite rare. However i WOULD recommend a controller, using the keyboard is a tad difficult for quite a few of the maps.			"

								This game is intense. -It packed with content and user created levels. -looks absolutly breathtaking -simply fun to play-If your a fan of electronic music this game is for you!! Add your own custom library and fly awayif you have been shafted with early access games before like me, prepare yourself to play an early access game that feels more complete than most full releases out there. Its totally worth the money trust me!Things Id love to see added that would feel right at home with this action:-Machine gun turrets- Missle turrets-Lazer turrets that cause you to overheat  "

								Game is great and good and i would recomend this game to any one who likes to race and defy physics even though it is in beta. Like playing around with the lasers to see how chopped up i get.Pro's:- Cool environments.- Ability to fly.- WALLRIDING!! - Nice physics- Lasers!!!!- Effects on when you get sliced by lasers which can make racing a little more challenging since you may be racing with half of a car.- Lasers!!!- Visual effectsCon's: - None unless you include: Laser's, falling, crashing and dying but who cares.To the creators of this game. Keep up the good work. Also on extra note, 10/10 for the game.			"

								WOAH! This game isn't your average racing game because of all of the obstacles you have to dodge as well as the flying mechanic. Now that is cool. You know what? Don't even spend another minute looking at the other reviews on this game! Buy while the game is still in beta. Now. I MEAN IT. NOW. I AM NOT KIDDING.			"

								Would I recommend Distance?WOULD. I. RECOMMEND. DISTANCE?In a word, yes.But let me tell you why.I should start with the fact that I've been playing Distance since the later stages of alpha. I've put almost two-hundred hours into the game and more into building the community, from starting a weekly event (Speedy Saturday!), doing weekly community track showcases (with over 600 tracks at the time of writing this, there's a lot of tracks to go through!), and doing a 24-hour charity livestream called Distathon to raise over $2,000 with the help of the amazing Distance community and the developers!Not only are the devs some of the coolest people, but the community is boss and just keeps growing.The game itself features tight controls, a solid learning curve, a sick soundtrack, intense level design and so much more. All wrapped up in a nice little burrito of tron-hotwheels-mashup goodness.One of the VERY few games that's able to keep me coming back, I believe if you're at all interested in a game that's the lovechild of tron and hotwheels, you'll enjoy this.:)			"

								lol decided to update my review, because my previous one was not helpful :PDistance is a great game. It has all the stuff that will keep you coming back for more, and for it's current stage in development, pretty much bug-free. The game's mechanics are awesome - stuff that I've never seen in vehicle games before, such as your car getting parts sliced off wherever lasers pass through, and the ability to fly, flip, and drive upside down.The inclusion of 4 players splitscreen, AND online multiplayer really makes this gem of a game stand out.The best way to describe this game is probably TrackMania + Tron + Jet Car Stunts. In my opinion, the only thing it's lacking is a battle mode (i.e, weapons). I understand that a lot of fans of the original Nitronic Rush want Distance to be very similar, but that's no reason not to add a separate battle mode - why not have the best of both worlds?In all, definitely a ""must own"" in my books, and it's something that I'll always come back to for a quick 'fun' fix :)			"

								Hands down, the BEST $20 I've ever spent on my Steam account, developer did an amazing job with this one! To me it clearly evokes the the style of Tron, but that's merely my opinion. As much as I appreciated the game's soundtrack, the tempation of killing the game's master volume and replacing it with Daft Punk's Tron Legacy Reconfigured album proved FAR to great. SImply put, racing nirvana. 5/5Pro's:*Silky smooth controls for gamepad*Beautiful, gorgeous Tron themed visuals*Soundtrack*SPLITSCREEN*Track editorCon's:*Updates to fix minor bugs like tutorial button prompts*Haven't tested multiplayer (not a con, obviously)-it could be the dopest aspect of the game for all I know.

								This is so incredibly fun! As some of you know this is from a concept that was created in college by the guys, it was called nitronic rush. After what they have achieved from there to Distance is particularly amazing!  My first thoughts I had in my mind that this was early access (just released as early access on december the 10th). As soon as i got into playing the visuals are spot on, the gameplay is extremely fun and addicting and the overall concept is great. Yes, then i discovered the mechanics: Boosting, jumping, flying and wall jumping; crazy stuff like that! THE POTENTIAL I can't even begin to explain the potential this game has, at the moment it actually is decently polished but not many official levels and progression pointers and goals, i'd imagine that to be fun. But there is the community making levels and there is a powerful level editor, it's nice that it has that. There is the Adventure mode which is short at the moment (and there isn't a story to it really). Arcade mode which has various gamemodes in it to play your community levels and official levels.  So, do i reccomend this game? Yes, i do. If you'd like to support it at it's current state i'd definetley reccomend for you to purchase it. It also has multiplayer and a friendly community which is great! SIMILAR GAMES: Trackmania, LittleBigPlanet Karting.			"

								Distance is an experimental survival racing game made by Refract, who previously released Nitronic Rush during their time at Digi Pen.  Nitronic Rush can be downloaded for free at http://nitronic-rush.com/.  If you are at all interested in Distance, play Nitronic Rush first, as they are very similar.In Distance, you control a kickass sci fi car with thrusters, wings and a giant rocket booster.  You race through digital, TRON Legacy styled cities filled with lasers, buzzsaws and angry computer viruses.  While the new art style is very pretty, some clarity is lost behind all the bloom and neon lines.  In Nitronic Rush, obstacles and hazards were always a very bright red, while in Distance they can and often will be a similar color to the rest of the track, making it somewhat harder to see them at a Distance (heh). In addition, the world seems more lifeless compared to the 70's TRON world of Nitronic Rush.  While this seems to be a deliberate choice on Refract's part, given that Story Mode seems to focus on an abandoned world, this doesn't change the fact that the levels are rather sterile and samey.  With the exception of one song, most of the soundtrack, while great, is also very similar which is an odd change after Rush's varied beats.    While the game is still in beta, it does have a slight lack of content when compared to Rush.  There are more Story levels, but fewer Challenge levels, and no Hardcore levels.  The overall level design is a bit more tame and safe than Rush's was.  There is both a track editor and a random track generator to make up for this, however, and many of the community tracks are incredible (and a good deal tougher than the rather easy official levels).There are a few other game modes besides the races.  Stunt has you doing mad tricks in an arena to score big points, Speed and Style is a mix of Stunt and Sprint, Reverse Tag is a game of keep away/king of the hill, and Soccer is, well, soccer.  Stunt is rather boring due to the lack of an announcer, another feature missing from Nitronic Rush.  In addition, several stunts possible in Rush are missing in DIstance.  Speed and Style is good fun, as you have to win the race AND pull of tricks to win.  Reverse Tag is a fun game of wits, though the official arenas are all either too big or too small.  I recommend the community level ""Pipe Plaza"" for this mode.  Soccer is a mess, the ball is nearly impossible to control and  the levels are a cluttered nightmare.  It might be good for some couch laughs with 4 players (Distance features Split Screen for all modes) but should be avoided in smaller groups.Now, despite these complaints, I still highly recommend this game.  It's the most fun I've had with a racing game in quite some time, and is beautifully creative.  Even if you don't like traditional racing games, give Distance (or Nitronic Rush) a shot.  They're very different from the competetion.To finish this review up, I'll make a list of little things that you probably don't care about-Default control scheme on controllers is flawed, thange LB to boost like it was in Rush-Bring back the announcer-Bring back wheelies and side wheelies-While you're at it, just port all of Nitronic Rush's levels into Distance			"

								I started playing racing games during the glory days of Carmageddon and ""FZR2000"" ;) and i have remained unimpressed ever since NFS Underground.It's hard for a racing game to impress nowadays... Why ? well we kinda seen it all... haven't we ?I mean.. what could they possibly do to impress us ?Well Distance did it...The game features a fresh take on the trackmania recipe with pleasant Tron-ish graphics.The soundtrack is ok but considering the way the actual game plays ...perhaps something a bit more ""strong"" would have been better.You don't get to chose from X number of cars and have only one which is slightly customizable...a color here and a accent there. Strangely i never felt the need to change my car and i never felt like the game would benefit from a larger variety of vehicles.So what is this game all about ?Driving as fast as you can and avoiding all obstacles as swiftly and as elegantly as you can.The game features several game modes such as Sprint, Stunt, Speed and Style, Challenge etc...When it comes to multiplayer we have either split screen (up to 4 players, only one can use keyboard the rest have to use controllers, and in 2 player mode you can chose vertical or horizontal split screen) And then we have the online component for up to 6 players.The game includes a full and very complete level editor and steam workshop support (for which you can already download over 100 tracks). Obviously this can ad a ton of replay value, and if you fancy yourself a hot-shot designer maybe you will make the next ""epic track"".There is even a single player campaign which is used as a tutorial and introduction to this futuristic high tech world (full of sharp/pointy/blunt death-traps that are in your way!).During this campaign you will learn how to barrel roll, fly, hover and glide in zero gravity.The games main mechanic is the boost. There is no recharge time for it like in most games but you do need to be careful not to overheat or else you go BooM! There are some gates which will either partly or fully cool and regenerate your car for all the damage taken up to that point.Something i really liked was the way the HUD is done, it is mostly integrated into the game elements, which dose lots for the overall feel of the game. There are some who do not like this aspect because at times the HUD is not visible. In my opinion this is not a big deal because a game such as this should be played by.. ""feel"" if that makes any sens...Another design element i really appreciate is the way vibration is done for the 360 controller. This is used to GRADUALLY warn you about how overheated your car is. This means that you can keep your eyes on the track and off your rear bumper. When it comes to the ugly ""early access"" tag i would go as far as to say that Distance dose not really need it. The single player campaign is not complete and the mouse is not functional in all menus... but these are all the early access ""scars"" i could find in my time with the game.I can go on and on about Distance but i don't wanna bore you to much so let's wrap-it up.""The Good""-The Track Editor- is not exactly user friendly but its a very complete tool-The Graphics- although graphics are a rather subjective topic in my opinion-Gameplay- rock solid, pure gaming, no nonsense-HUD Design- this is the way a HUD should be done in modern games, yes it has some issues, but its a big step forward from the classic and outdated designs.""The Bad""-Only 6 players in online multiplayer...How Could You ?!""The Meh""-Soundtrack- I believe there are much better options for a game that plays like this...but again this is a subjective topic by nature.What else is there to say ? Drop the clutch, boost to max, juke the spikes and i'll see you at the finish line...if you get there ;)For a clearer view you can watch my first impressions video :

								Distance is one of the games that takes your breath away. I know that you can give hundreds of games that has graphics that are better than these, and you can suggest many other racing games that are much more exciting than this. But Distance just provides something much, much different. In that you are met with such exhilerating challenges, as if you are in a roller coaster. There are several times when I am truly surprised at the turn of events in every sector that was played. I mean, jumping roads, flying, boosters, zero gravity floating, spinning road spikes, blades in roads, dark skyscrapers, portals, and more. You don't get that in a normal racing game.You won't regret it, you wontOne of the most exciting games I've ever played, 100/10 would play again.			"

								What would it take to redefine a genre?I guess in the case of racing, Refract decided to try throwing in cars with boost jumps, parkour, wings, and tracks with deadly traps.And my god does it work in extraordinary ways.Distance is the successor to the cult hit Nitronic Rush, now with online support, a slick new art style and some intense, dark music to go along with the split-second adrenaline rush of dodging traps by the skin of your teeth. It has some superb, abstract track design reminiscent of any of the TrackMania titles, but adds in the insane speed of a Need for Speed or Burnout game combined with obstacles taken right out of a kart racer. It could also be safe to say it's the Tron: Legacy we never properly got and then some, cuz it's got the bells and whistles but is a much more enjoyable and entertaining experience. That's also a major disservice to this incredible beta to an incredible game.The Early Access version of Distance offers quite a lot for a small package, including the makings of an adventure mode that add in a Journey-esque dash of story... if Journey had lots of giant sawblades, lasers, and death-defying jumps in a cyberpunk setting, on top of a traditional Arcade mode that games seem to have lost touch with in recent years. And of course, there's the aforementioned multiplayer which throws in your traditional races as well as a briefly novel tag mode and a stunt mode that takes another queue from Burnout minus the exploding cars. Buy and large, the main reason to play the game is for the ""Survival"" or ""Speed and Style"" modes, where it's testing your reflexes and split-second maneuvering around traps and finding clever (and stylish) ways to beat a track in the quickest time possible. Mastering these stages is a delight and even just killing five minutes to feed a need for speed while jamming to some intense electronica that makes you feel like a badass when you nail those impossible jumps is an insatiable feeling that makes me always want to come back for more.It's just a shame the current version doesn't have a lot to offer when looking at the official offerings, but the game's taken a life of its' own with the community created maps. It's just a small shame that one of the problems the game suffers, and what goes into common community level design, is the confusion of good map design with unfair memorization challenges. It's these types of maps that make for way too many unofficial tracks that feel overbearing, sloppy, and infuriating when compared to the more official offerings that have good ebbs, flows, and difficulty curves in each track that were both challenging but also more than possible. However, that's not to say that there haven't been rising stars in the community mappers as there have certainly been tracks that rival even Refract's stages, which make slogging through the sloppy maps worth it when you come across that solid, tightly-designed gem. But as it stands though, the map-making scene isn't as vibrant as, say, most of Valve's games or Unreal Tournament, so the Workshop might feel barren, at least until the game picks up in popularity and creative level designers.That said, this game, frankly, deserves a lot more of that popularity, because it's just an absolutely fun game to play, with the bonus of being a great looker with a damn fine soundtrack. Refract might be one of the new Indie kids on the block, but they are certainly no amateurs at making a great racing game. Distance is worth your time, your money, and your commitment to beating your own and your friend's high scores. In this day and age of more realistic, simulated racing games, it's time we had a game like this to come along and remind us we're playing video games for the overwhelming, exciting, and expansive possibilities of the medium and not needing to be bound by realistic settings, physics, and speeds.So, can you survive the distance? You should jump behind the wheel and find out.			"

								Right, so first of all this game is in Early Access so yes there is tweaking needed and a lot of other stuff however that will not change anything about this review.-------------------So I bought this game after seeing something on Youtube about it back in June 2015 and like most of the games I've got I thought It was an amazing concept, looked stunning and looked very well made so I purchased it.Throughout the course of this game's development it has went through some very good changes and the developers are constantly looking to add more.I recently contacted the company asking them if they would be open for some feedback and they were! It actually surprised me that they were, not many developers/companies these days want to deal with feedback. They have replied to me everytime I have responded and honestly I am glad I purchased this game to support their hardwork.I recommend this game to anyone, it has an amazing concept and look extremly good for what it is. I can't get enough of this game and to be quite honest I can't wait to see what they add in the future! They have already added some amazing things and I'm looking forward to many more!			"

								What a fun, unique little gem of a game!  A driving/platforming/flying/puzzle game in a beautiful (and at times dystopian), TRON-like world.The game is mostly about driving and jumping over or dodging road hazards, but with touches of flying. The puzzle element comes into play on rare occasions where it is not obvious where you are supposed to go.  You can use your set of driving/hopping/flying moves to find the level's exit portal.  You can also sometimes jump on the sides of walls and grip to them.  It can leave you not knowhing which way is up.  That is what the 3D compass display is for.The level aesthetics, atmosphere and music are all excellent.  It can be very trippy.  Not in a psychadelic way but more of a zooming through a chill, digital soundscape kind of way.The only negative I can think of is in terms of it's control configuration system.  The game works great with the Steam controller's trackpad for steering.  Turn the steering sensitivity all the way up so it does not dampen your trackpad input.The problem is the game wants to use only your keyboard or only your game controller.   While editing your profile you can not mix and match Xinput controls and keyboard controls.  And the game has a bunch of controls to assign.The game does respond to both Xinput and keyboard inputs.  But pressing something on the keyboard disables the right trigger until you move the analog stick (via the track pad in my case).  So it only listens to one at a time.  It is still early access so I hope the devs can make this more flexible.Control weirdness aside, I highly recommend!			"

Here is my review of DistanceDistance is being developed by Refract Studio which also made Nitronic Rush ( a free game ) when they we're in DigiPen as Student, so Distance is a sequel of Nitronic Rush.Distance have in content - A short adventure mode who learn you the basics tricks of the game- A Arcade mode with others mode of racing, Like Sprint, Stunt and others.- A Level Editor where you can create your owns track and share it on the steam workshop- Like i said above you can download tracks from others user on the Steam Workshop, you have more than 1600 tracks on it, all i can say these track are really nice and some are hard but can be done by using what you learn in the short adventure mode.About the adventure mode which can be completed in 30-45 minutes, but this one have some decent tracks with decent music. I really liked it. the difficulty is not hard and you learn all the tricks you can use in others levels. My favorite adventure mode tracks is the Monolith one. When you completed this mode, you can go in Arcade mode than sprint, to re do them and get medals, and unlock 3 more levels ( depend of the medals you get )The game is using the Unity engine, which run pretty nice on lower end pc or laptop. If you plan to buy it, i suggest you for the moment, to use the Experimental Build which run better on low end pc.About the Level Editor, this one is really complete you can use the music you want on your tracks, and others cool feature :).I hope you liked my review, and then probably you will buy it. The game is still in Beta ( Early Access & soon in stable build ) but the developers always listen their community, even on twitter and steam forums.The game cost 20€ or 20$ depend of your country, but you won't be disappointed of Distance.

								I'm gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that, even though this game isn't even finished, with all of the fresh mechanics, sheer amount of levels, and raw epicness it already produces, this is definitely the best racing game I've ever played. Even better than Motorstorm.The first thing that struck out to me was, before I even realized how tight the jumping was, that I could even jump at all; I'm not used to that! Yet here I am now wishing that almost every arcade racer took advantage of this mechanic. Another thing I love is how Refract makes great use of Motorstorm-style boost mechanics rather than standard nitrous, where instead of running out of extra speed, you keep going and going until you overheat and blow up; sure, it's not realistic, but hey, it's much more fun and superb this way as it is.And finally, the sheer intensity and awe you generally feel as your vehicle strolls down the levels are a sight that I honestly cannot match with any other game within this genre, or any game ever for that matter. I mean, your car keeps going even when sliced in half by lasers! Not even Wipeout could match this.I doubt I said anything somebody hasn't already brought up, but it feels great being able to express how amazing this game is. Definitely worth full price. Even in early access.			"

								Well, this is toughie. On the one hand -- excellent initial idea, simple but very ""tasty"" visuals, catchy gameplay and absolutely gorgeous soundtrack. On the other -- there's definitely very little of in-house made content, and this is the most serious issue. When I played Distance, it reminded of Trackmania in a way, an old one, without all the bells and whistles -- a 2007 Nations, for example, and while the physics here are, well, rudimentary -- the feeling is pretty much the same. But while Trackmania was intended to play online, it still had heaps of content for single player mode. In case of Distance, I was finished with its Adventure Mode in less than an hour.Online mode is something else. Well, that if you'll be able to find public server. And if you'll be able to connect to it. Because there's no official servers or dedicated server software, people should host sessions from their own computers, and since pretty much everybody are behind a NAT these days, it makes a task of finding suitable server really difficult.Ports are okay at the very least -- as Linux gamer, I'm very pleased with how smooth and troubleless game runs on my not-so-fast-by-novadays-standarts-rig. As far as I know, Mac version runs pretty much the same.If eventually campaign will be like four or five hours long, then I guess my money were well spent. I'd like to believe that this is how things will turn up. For now, you'll have to dig deep into Steam Workshop, looking for decent maps.			"

								I really don't know what to say about Distance. I've literally been staring at the review box for over 10 minutes now, trying to find a way to describe how simply amazing this game is. Distance is one of those games that is just an absolute blast to play. You'll never find a dull moment while playing this game, unless of course you are exploring the ♥♥♥♥♥ier portion of the community made maps, which I even have fun doing occasionally. The fast-paced madness combined with the epic, hypnotic music makes Distance a game to truly love. I can say with confidence that this is one of my favorite games of 2014, and it deserves more recognition. Unless you hate fast-paced racing mixed with compelling concepts, you'll adore this masterpiece called Distance.			"

								Wow. What a ride. Not only is Distance a lot of fun to play, but it is quite an accomplishment for a piece of artwork as well. The soundtrack is killer, the visuals are both beautiful and stimulating, and the coding seems solid and gameplay is fun. It reminds me of trials, except with a different kind of skill focus. Not only are all of these aspects well done, but they are also fantastically blended together - they compliment each other. The visuals go to the beat of the music, and the feel of the tracks blend with the flow of the audio and visuals. It's great. Kind of a ""Audiosurf meets Spy Hunter meets Trials"".Two thumbs up.			"

								This is a pretty fun racing game because of 1. The ability to fly, and 2. The challenging tracks, but most of my game time was on split screen mode, and tracks are limited unless you download more. It is fun for a while but has no customization, and the maps are very similar. I would reccomend buying it for 10$ like I did, only if you are looking for a fun split screen game, other than that I prefer more open world racing games:-)    8/10			"

								Distance is worth buying if you're looking for a racing game that involves more than driving down a basic track. It will only take you about an hour to drive through all of the tracks, but there is multiplayer locally and online, and you can retry tracks to see if you can get to the top of the leaderboards. The mechanics definitely make the game more hardcore than other racing games, but if you don't care about leaderboards, the game's difficulty goes way down if you don't continuously boost and ignore the shortcuts and other harder areas to drive through.Video of a near perfect run through the hardest level(Currently ranked 3rd)

								A heavily Tron inspired, post apocalyptic descent into racing madness.The music pairs well with the increasing difficulty of the tracks (pun not originally intended) and half the time during gameplay I couldn't tell if using a power or two to save myself was intended or not.For instance, on more than one occasion during playing, I had flown off of the track, only to save myself by activating my car's flying powers and returning to it. Were it not for my adrenaline-rushed self preservation instincts kicking in, I might have tried to land on one of the many cyber buildings dotting the landscape- in fact, i ended up doing just this by accident a few times during gameplay.The campaign is still a work in progress, but I find that a short and sweet campaign for this game is the best ticket anyway. It doesn't explain much, and I'm still figuring out how I managed to ""kill"" the first boss, but I did find myself distracted several times throughout the first few levels, trying to read the signage and propaganda scattered across the map. Once again, it reminds me a lot of Tron, especially the internet levels, as it should.In the background, you can see what might be planet Earth, but the geography is bizarre. In the distance I see what I can only assume are inhabited continents, but beneath there's only a maelstrom of some kind, with an ominous symbol in the middle that looks suspiciously like the ""Alliance"" symbol you encounter repeatedly through the game. Further on in the horizon, pillars are visible. What could they mean? Is this all a computer simulation, or is this our horrible future?But if our eyes are real, how can mirrors be real?10/10, would go the Distance as many times as is automotively possible.			"

								I enjoy Distance, because I'm a guy who loves arcade-ish racing games in general. The question whether you'd like it is depending on your taste of games. It's a racing genre that needs more explanation.So here is my review with a comparison to the older, yet free game ""Nitronic Rush"".The control of the car is great and is heavily improved upon since Nitronic Rush, where you'd fling around carelessly by accident (though this was a lot of fun). Small turns in Distance are not as easy to make though. A controller is nice to use in case you want to aim for a nice time on a track.The story mode, despite being minimal, has an enjoyable exploration feeling; much like it's earlier version. Shame it's not finished yet, but it looks to be promising. Playing this with some friends by giving each other the controller or keyboard is a lot of fun too.This all is nothing I was worried about when it came to purchasing Distance. What worried me and still slightly does is the replayablity of the game. As of now Distance, does not have this so much. Nitronic Rush was free and for me the joy was kinda out of it when I completed the storyline. You've kind-of seen it all by the time you're done with it. Distance's multiplayer aspect improves on this a lot, so does the custom levels and level-editor. If all this to improve it makes the game worth the price tag of 19,99 euro's; I'm not so sure.Eventually after fully experiencing the Story Mode the game turns from survival exploration racing to precision racing. It's kind of the same thing as Trackmania actually. Although there's more control over your car and it's set in a whole different setting. If you're much into precision racing; I see you'll have a decent amount of replayability with this game. Yet if you're only in for the exploration, I think you're through the game rather quickly.Get this game if you like precision racing, otherwise wait for a 40% discount. 33% works if you're desperate to try it.:^)7.6*/10*grade improves as the game improves "

								Distance takes the racing game genre and instead of some derpy AI cars to annoy you throws you into a world of sawblades, grinders, lasers, zero-gravity and several ways to crash horribly with only yourself to blame.Jimp, flip, spin, fly and boost your way to victory with the thrusters and wings at your disposal on this strange car that can operate after being cut into a single wheel, or fall into the abyss below the track and crash for the millionth time.This game is one I will be sure to play for a very long time, trying to squeeze those extra milliseconds out of the turns or shaving off several whole seconds by finding a new shortcut to try and get higher on that global leaderboard.With several other gamemodes to keep you entertained you'll easily want to keep coming back to this title, especially with friends.In it's current state I'd rate it as a solid: 9.5/10It's not a 10 because of a few optimization issues here and there.

								Distance really is a phenomenal game. It's fast, it's flashy, it's gorgeous and it's as casual or hardcore as you like. Its main game mode, Sprint, is all about getting the best possible time to the end of a track, while dynamic obstacles are in your way, including lasers, buzz saws, etc. Community-wise, it is the follow-up to the outstanding Nitronic Rush, which you should try if you're not sure about Distance. (It's free.) Distance has a great community already, churning out several maps a week. That fixes all that I would have labeled damning about Nitronic Rush. Additional improvements are a better physics engine, updated graphics, customizable vehicle appearance, etc. Just an amazing game, and the multiplayer is very stable. "

								Back in 2011 a small group of 11 DigiPen students created a survival racing game. But this wasn't your typical racing survival experience. Players were thrown into an aesthetically pleasing digital world where you had to avoid various amount of obstacles as you drove fast, spun, flipped, flew, through an infected computer mainframe that doubled as a city. The game was released to the masses soon after DigiPen awarded it 5 awards including Game of the Year, Best Junior Game, Best Graphics, Best Physics, and Best 3D Visual Design. It won many awards from other Indepedent Game award shows in the following year.What originally started off as a freeware final project for school has evolved into a sucessor worthy of it's asking price. Distance is entirely built around the control scheme and physics of it's older brother so veterans will feel right at home with this installment. And, since it plays like it's predecessor, newbies won't feel overwhelmed. This is the kind of game that's easy to pick up but insanely difficult to master. So far the devs have shown a lot of promise in new design choices and the game is updated quite frequently. For example, one significant improvement is the change to cutting hazards. In Nitronic Rush, lasers and saws would pretty much destroy you in a single hit. Now, the devs have changed that so those hazards use a dynamic damage system to actually destroy the car without ruining your run. It's so absolutely crazy to be going at full speed, cut your car in two like a banana, and try to maintain control towards the next regeneration checkpoint. At the moment the game's campaign is unfinished but that doesn't mean other elements aren't completed. The developers generously included the entire development kit within the game itself and integrated the Steam workshop. This allows anyone to create their own tracks and, as an added bonus, gives experienced game designers the ability to add unique and original content to the tracks they make allowing for endless creativity. And, thanks to an active community, endless replayability. All this and it even has multiplayer... all for a deliciously low price of $20.			"

								I first learned about this game way back when Steam Greenlight was starting and insantly gave it the pass. When I finally got my hands on the BETA, I knew right there that this was going to be an amazing game. Its not even out yet and its already phenomenal! I will have to do a full review when its fully released.			"

								I really don't know why I doubted this game.I was iffy on buying this game considering it was indie, and early access seemed to plague it which tends to have a effect of making a game utter crap.But I picked it up anyway, it looked interesting, and god yes it is, this game is fun, doesn't matter that its in early access, its worth the purchase.

								So, Distance, this game is about you, a car, driving through a crazy and confusing world full of dangeround hazards, and amazing music. This game has a story mode, which has you racing through a few levels, 12 right now the devs are worink on adding more, it has a arcade mode, which I didn't play and it has community games, which are on story levels, or on custom made levels. The level creater is verry well made, for a racing game. This game also allows you to customize you racer, it allows for a few profiles, which I used for my IRL freinds when we did the split screen games. The thing I had the most fun with though is the split screen mode, which I played a rocket leaugh esk game in which you hit a ball into a goal, but the course is covvered in lazers, saw blades, and other werd traps. I give this game 10 dubstep lazers out of 10.			"

								Did you ever play the Rush games? Specifically Rush 2049. This game feels a lot like that, minus AI opponents. Your car has wings and you can flip around and do neat tricks. A big part of the enjoyment I've gotten out of this game is the community levels since the campaign is pretty short. Once you learn all the abilities the car has you get a real good sense of speed and the difficult tracks have you jumping and spinning onto walls and ceilings into half-loops in quick succession and it just feels great!

								Distance is what Aperture Science would have created if they had watched Tron Legacy. This game is absolutely gorgeous! I had to buy it the moment i played it in my friends PC. The visual, the gameplay, even the credits is a masterpiece! If i had to choose the top 3 racing games i've played this decade, i'm sure Distance would have made it second or even first position.Enough with the compliments, let's talk more about the game.Distance is a futuristic racing game like nothing else. You are in control of a car that can boost, jump and fly (yeah, it's a transform). The game has a storyline that feels a bit artistic. It has no narrative, just you, the stages and the musics (that i have to say, it fits just perfect with the game). Since it is still Early Access, it isn't complete yet, but i can already see it developing really good!The arcade mode seems to be really good, even better when played with a friend or in online mode. And now with custom tracks made by the community, i can't even describe how big is the potential of this game.BUT, it has it cons (for now, it might change in the future). In current stages, there is no bots in arcade mode. I feel like this is needed in every racing game, mainly in this game! I want to play the arcade mode when my friends aren't avaliable and online mode isn't quiet what i'm looking for everytime.The storyline NEEDS a narrative. Sometimes you feel a little lonely when traveling through the stages and the music is low. The storyline of this game shows potential and a narrative like the one in Portal games would fit just perfectly.If i would recommend this game to everyone in this planet? OF COURSE! This game needs more attention! I would easily pay 60 bucks for this game when it gets out of early access. It really looks like a AAA game.Plus, spin my car in the air and land it like a boss IS SO DAMN COOL! 10/10			"

								Distance is one of the best ""betas"" I have ever seen, and I almost cringe at the fact that it is still called a ""beta."" The fundamentals of the game have already been so fleshed out, including a great multiplayer and single player expereince and gives you one of those feelings that you need to do something in tune with the music, as this games soundtrack, if you enjoy electronic/dubstep music, is astounding. This game offers a great expereince for those that just need a little game to fall in love with. The environments are also a great feature, with great futuristic aesthetics to them. Overall, pick this game up if you just want a little game that gives a great satisfaction whenever you do anything remotely awesome.Pros:- Fleshed out, despite the ""beta"" tag.- Great soundtrack.- Great singleplayer or multiplayer experience.- Great Steam Workshop compatibility, with some great maps out there already.Cons:- The singleplayer ""story"" could be a little longer, but the game distinctly tells you that it will probably change from the time of this release to the final one.

								Fun, fast-paced racing game with an awesome soundtrack and a very healthy content-creating community. Good polish for an early-access game, though futher optimization would be greatly appreciated. Online community has been both friendly and helpful in my experience. Attractive art direction and a great setting. Online isn't feature-rich at the moment, but it'll get you by. The difficulty might be a little high at the beginning, especially regarding jumping onto walls and ceilings as well as gravity shifts, but once you learn how to deal with it it becomes a joy.			"

								As a 'Nitronic Rush' player there are lots of things I like about this game, but there are also a few points which I'd like to adress (note that this is a beta).Let's start with the good stuff:*Amazing style & graphics*Intense music*Great athmosphere*Smooth gameplay*Lots of different areas and modes to play in (race, challenge, stunt etc).*A multiplayer (both online and splitscreen, which Nitronic Rush didn't include, not in real time that is).*A level editor*Good gamepad supportAnd the less good things (along with thoughts):*I have an up to date and strong computer, yet this game sometimes has major framerate issues! Especially during the multiplayer (I'm not the first one complaining).*This game would benefit if it featured a 'drift' system. As it is now the breaks feel a bit off and stiff. I think drifting would make this game extra intense (maybe even awarding the player with points/small nitro bonuses for a good drift?)*The engine/nitro sounds were a bit soft and dissapointing, especially in comparison with Nitronic Rush, which felt much more faster.*In Nitronic Rush there were big spinning blades on which you could drift/slide. Why not make those without the teeth as a drifting platform in a few areas? (as an extra).Still this game is extremely cool and well made thus far, and don't forget it's still in it's beta state!

								This is a review WITHOUT the multiplayer experieance, just single driving throuth the course experieance.Want to see flashy lights and fly with your own music? Distance is here for you.The story mode is not yet complete and adds no real depth to the game as the storyline is non-existant, however it serves as a perfect tutorial without much use of words.There DEFINATELY needs some customizations with the car, custom maps are marvelous but the same car makes it slightly off focus time to time.Maps, lets talk about maps, it's just MARVELOUS! MARVELOUS! I wrote that twice for emphasis. The community maps are all works of art as I wonder how on earth they managed to imagine everything.Blaring flashing lights and the twists, curves, confusion of which way is sky and which way is ground. You may think you're on the ground until you jump to know that you were on the celing.Feel the speed when you speed up, controls start to get difficult as you reach the max speed just blaring your booster down the lane, the subtle shake of the car and blurring experieance is a stress reliever for me!Gameplay is absolutely friendly, as dying is just to reset and get back on course. It sometimes actually helps to find the road where you are stuck on.I would love to use a VR for this game, it would be dizzy and some custom maps seem high on drugs but the feel like you're flying is something that is needed.I wouldn't recommend it for hardcore gamers as it doesn't have depth but if you want to ride and want to defy gravity with speed for an hour or two, I will definatly say it's worth the money.(Though it would be better if you could get at least a 15% sale or something $20+ seems a bit too heavy to be 100% casual.)

								I've owned this game for a while now, and I can positively say it's one of the best arcade scifi racers to come out in a very long time. I really only have two complaints about the game. One, the text that appears on the right side of your car more often than not obstructs the player's view of the road. This has resulted in a few slightly hilarious ""deaths"". Two, mutiplayer could use a bit of work. Very rarely am I actually able to connect to other players' servers, even after recommended firewall and network settings have been applied. Do I think it's worth the $20? Well, yes, for the most part. I feel like a price point of $15 would look more appealing, but $20 is fair. Overall, Distance is an enjoyable experience. I have and always will recommend it to players looking for a thrilling racing game.			"

The game will start off challenging as all hell as you try to clunkly get the hang of jumping to different surfaces but once you do you'll never let go of the boost button making it a game of true skill. The community content for it is also extremely well done and extremely difficult but in the good way. Most of it is made by people who have the mentality of mastering the games mechanics so you'll have to do so also but once you do it is a game of pure bliss.			"

								To people who may be looking for a demo, Nitronic Rush was a single player game made by the same team that plays very similarly (at least in terms of controls) and that was totally free, so even if it's not as polished (graphics are subjective, but I much prefer the updated version) it's worth a try. Also, the game has enough content (on it's own and with the level editor/workshop) already to justify a purchase and constant updates so a very good Alpha/Beta release. Also, the game tends to run very well on my PC, but I can't say much else in regards to performance. (Disclainer: I did back this on Kickstarter, so I may be a bit biased towards it)			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to start out this review by saying that I have a lot of faith in this game.Despite Early Access, Distance has shown a lot of promise and is alerady an absolute blast to play. There are other, better reviews that discuss game mechanics and what it has to offer, so I'm going to skip that and ask:Do any of you, like me, remember the show Acceleracers?Formed by Hotwheels, this was an animated series that was, in my opinion, one of the best to existance. Basically, the top racers from around the world are chosen to form a small group known as the Acceleracers. They use a portal to warp to other dimensions with prebuilt tracks that they can race on. Each of these dimensions had a different feel and driving technique needed to master it. If you got to the end portal before the one hour time limit and before anyone else, you gained an acceletron; a small card-like device that gives your car ""superpowers"", and is in line with the theme of the dimension that you gained it from.Anyway, the series was insane not because of the tension between the human racers, evil robot racecars that tried to kill them, a secret society formed by the main character's own dad, and the amazing plot, but because of the stunts that all the cars pulled off in the show. Vert, the main character, is known for his car's jets being able to give him a boost upward, effectively ""jumping"". Additionally, cars were souped up with things like nitrox (a glorified version of nitro) and things that allowed them to fly, shoot a grappling hook, etc. One of the most memorable things is when, in the final movie, was when Vert was directed by Tesla (the guy overseeing all the human drivers) to go through one final test. I'm not going to spoil it, but anyone who's seen it should know what I'm talking about. Anyway, it's a 1 on 1 race through every single one of the dimensions, and the thing is that Vert doesn't have any acceletrons. So, it's his pure memorization and skill that he needs to speedrun through the entire Accelerace before time runs out.This game captures this perfectly.Almost every game, I imagine myself as Vert driving, nimbly avoiding all obstacles, using boosters to jump, and maintaining a rediculous high speed while knowing that one slip up could destroy me and my car.Additionally, in the series, there were always memorable moments of cars getting wiped out, flying out into rocks, smashing themselves off the road while the other cars kept it cool and just drove like life depended on it (which it did). There was even one scene where a car was lasered in half, and cars flying off the edge of the narrow track into oblivion. Sound familiar?Anyway, it was not the look or feel of the game so much as the fact that I had finally discovered an accurate representation of Acceleracers I had always been looking for. Whoever knows the show will be amazed at how many moments you've thought, ""wow, just like Acceleracers"", I know I have.Not many will know what it is though, I'm sure of that. But anyone who does, this is the game you've been waiting for.			"

								*WILL BE UPDATED AT FULL RELEASE*Distance is simply one of the best games on Early Access. The sequel to Nitronic Rush is fast, intense, and a joy to play.The graphics in this game are glorious. The tron-like style is perfect for this type of game and the amount of color on the screen is a treat for your eyes. The cars look great, with the ability to edit the car's color and glow - making each unique to the certain player when playing online. The graphics are also optimized well, making it run on lower-end machines. Distance at it's core is a survival racing game. Throughout the levels, you can do things like jump, boost, twist and fly. The levels have a directed path, but with the ability to fly - it adds an extra element of exploration and freedom. The game as of now has a strong amount of game modes. Adventure is Distance's story mode, it's short and doesn't really have a clear story; the levels are well designed and are fun. It's more so of a tutorial the first few levels which is good for those who have no clue what they are doing. In these levels, there are ramps, lasers, twisting roads, sawblades, and other things there to kill and confuse you. It requires a solid amount of skill, the boost has the ability to overheat and flying requires boost to actually use. It's a nice balance that doesn't feel restrictive. The sense of speed is fantastic, speeding past 3 lasers then twisting, dodging a pole and then flying over the sawblades just making it towards the regeneration checkpoint is exhilarating. There are also a bunch of other game modes as well - Sprint (time trial), Speed and Style (Time + Tricks), Challenge (Mini Challenge Levels), and Stunt (Tricks); there is also a reverse tag mode that I have yet to play. The amount of game modes are fresh and give players more to play. Lastly, is the integration of Steam Workshop. The community have already made some fantastic levels, one highlight is the replica of Rainbow Road from Mario Kart. The amount of levels and the quality of those are only going to grow. It's a match made in heaven. The audio is solid. It's sharp and clear. Where the game's sound shine though is the music. It immerses you in the game and only boosts the intense nature of the game. The controls are extremely smooth and responsive. I personally use a gamepad. If you do choose to use a gamepad, try using the triggers for both boost and jump as things can get awkward sometimes. With the amount of developer-made levels, gamemodes, online play, and community levels - there is tons to do already. The best part is, the game is going to keep on growing. If you live fast, survival racing games, you must get your hands on this. At $22 (CDN), it's a steal.

This game is excellent!First of all, this game is still in beta so if I wont talk to much about the game.PROSThere are five different gamply modes: Sprint (used for story more), Stunt, Tag and Soccer just to name a few. There are several diffrent features to this game (I haven't tried all of them only a few) VR, Track Editor, Trackmogify (Random Track Generator) and online play. The controls are incredibly responsive both on the keyboard and the controller (Logitech F310). Gameplay-wise the modes are diverse enough to be different, but similar enough that they are easy to pick up and play. The graphics with high graphic settings look absolutely beautiful. BUT BE WARNED, if you don't play on a very, Very, VERY, powerful computer, frame rate may be pretty bad if you play on a core i3 laptop in comparison.CONSWell, there isn't really a CONBut if there was, then I would say...Price.$19.99 might be a bit overpriced for you, it's not bad at all because of all the features tht are in the game. It's a good time to mention that Distance is a spiritual sequel to Nitronic Rush, an older game from 2011 by the same folks that made this game. (NR is Free BTW)OVERALLThis game is great, I personaly find this game to be just as good as NR. Price may be a bit much but, I can forgive since it's an indie game and Refract Studios deserves the money to make sure this game will be better than the Very Very Good Nitronic Rush.			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutely fantastic. I loved Nitronic Rush and Team Nitronic (now Refract Studios) have definitely lived up to, and gone way past the fun and excitement of it with Distance. I've been in since the beta, and so far I've loved every bit of it.While this game is in early access, I highly recommend it even if the game never updates again (which it will by the way, Refract are cool guys)First, the level editor: Steam Workshop support and a built in level editor is a game changer for any game, and this one especially. The editors advanced features reminds me of such things as Autodesk Maya, but can be simplified down to the Portal 2 in-game map creator. Tracks in the editor snap together and can be automatically resized. They act like splines and the track automatically is generated along them, so you do not have to worry about that at all. Everything is very easy yet advanced at the same time which will make some really brilliant levels (and has already infact).Multiplayer: This was the most requested feature from Nitronic Rush, and they've implemented it right down to the core of the game. It is done extremely well and I couldn't ask for anything more (well, maybe auto downloading of workshop levels to clients who dont have). It's really fun with mates or strangers on any of the modes: sprint, speed and style, challenge and reverse tag (shame they removed the football gamemode though).Atmosphere: The atmosphere of the game is clear from the start and I think it works really well. There's less of the really bright colours from Nitronic and the announcer is gone (for now at least). The world is dark and gloomy but mixed with flashing lights and exciting music makes for an interesting yet enjoyable experience. The soundtrack itself is incredible, Torcht and the team really have outdone themselves this time, it's much better than Nitronic Rush's music (and for the record, I loved Nitronic Rush's music).There are only a few things that I think should be worked. The first is optional realtime portals, since right now they work like a static 360* image wrapped around it - but don't get me wrong they look great and aren't noticeable at high speeds, of course this should be off by default and as an advanced graphics option like realtime reflections since they would require a beefy GPU. Another thing would be mod support for custom gamemode types. My biggest issue currently is no mouse support at all, not even for menus - but I'm sure it's planned (we are in Early Access right now, after all), but these are more like feature requests than actual issues - and I'm certain Refract has more up their sleeve for us, so we'll see.Conclusion: Get this game if you love any of these:A. Arcade racersB. Splitscreen gamesC. Sci-Fi gamesD. RacersE. Playing tag with your friendsF. Games with an amazing soundtrackG. Calm drivingH. Exciting drivingI. Polished gamesJ. Multiplayer racing with friendsK. Multiplayer racing with not friendsL. Nitronic RushM. Ex-DigiPen studentsN. Refract StudiosOkay I'll stop now, but seriously, get this game - you will not regret it.			"

								Amazing racing game with tron-like graphics. It is a very fast paced racing game, where a second can be the difference between literally life and death. Your car can be damaged-sliced in half, dented, and more. Graphically wise, it can be quite pretty with neon lights all over. When played with friends or online the gameplay is amazing,  the competition fierce, but even when you lag behind you will be cheered on by the willing and watching crowd. Adventure mode is a nice introduction to the game. It also has an amazing level editor that is easy to use, allowing you to create hundreds of maps-just look at the workshop to see some creations. Music is one of the things that truly fits this type of game, think techno-beat meets trons daft punk, makes you want to hit the nitro for even longer.			"

So, not sure if you want to buy this game, play Nitronic Rush (Its free, so just play it)(Link:http://nitronic-rush.com/). There is not much else I can do to explain this game, just know that the developers of this are very passionate in their work and that is clearly reflected in this fantastic game.			"

Early Access review, FEB 15.Great graphics, cool presentation (like music-bass pulsating colors), awesome !!! music. It's a pretty fast racing game; easy to learn, hard to master. Good reflexes are a must. 4/5 Official tracks are really good. From easy tutorial-like tracks to weird and fast paced ground-ceiling-wall-avoid-jump-through-hole. They look great, stuff pulsates colorful to the beaty music. They usually take about 2-4 min. so great for ""just another map"" feeling :D Graphis is awesome. Although some effects are pretty performance consuming (e.g. car reflections), even with a mediocre pc it still looks cool. Big screen/tv is a plus since all the effects can sometimes make orientation a bit hard, especially when playing split screen MP. Controls are fine (no mouse support though, but I don't mind). You can customize them and even put one action to 2 different buttons, but I think the default settings are just working good. Best played with controller in my opinion (worked with xbox 360 controller instantly). Sound is, as title says, fu**** awesome! Great beats, everything is responsive to the track (which works even in MP!), which really improves imersion (if you can say that for a SciFi racing game :D). Nothing to add here. Just turn up the bass + volume! (yes the music in the steam shop video is also in game music) Stuff like ""gold medals"" is not really necessary imho - but every player gets a profile and you can check your local player and global ranking for every track. Nice for local MP with your friends, as you can always check who's the best on which track if you'd like. Some customization is possible: you can change your cars colors, like primary, secondary, glow and sparcle color. Gets saved to the profile, so every player can make his own colored car. Design is still always the same, though.If you like racing games and are playing MP (and don't necessarily need weapons like Mario Cart), get this gem right now.If you play singe player only, maybe wait a bit for more content or a sale, as currently you can ""see and do everything"" in a couple of hours (unless you're the type who has to lead every ranked table there is :D).Did not use the map creator.Did play with controller only.Did not play online MP, just split screen.

								Below you'll find a video and a written impression on the game


YouTube™ Video: Distance: Early Impressions (Indie game arcade racer review and gameplay) 

			Views: 529		

			Distance: Early Impressions Distance video created on version: Beta 3297 Distance is a pretty nifty arcade racer... ""Early Impression"" are impressions on early access games available on Steam.		

Distance features high quality visuals and audio, with a great sound track. The game is essentially an arcade racer that focuses on avoiding obstacles and quick reflexes. It has a lot of very interesting ideas and mechanics, including flight (yeah, your car can fly), interesting play on gravity (drive on walls and ceiling), and some environmental hazards that are quite unique in how they can affect your performance.The game excels at giving the player the sensation of speed, but also keeps him/her on their toes as the tracks are always littered with piles of hazards. When you first jump into Distance, some parts of the game may get frustrating at first, and your first flight will probably end in tragedy. There is a learning curve, but if you can get over that hump, this game can feel incredibly satisfying as you learn to needle thread through obstacles, and flipping your car just at the right moment, you'll find that ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moment more than once.My only real complaint is how the game handles gravity some times. As mentioned previously, you can flip your car to drive on ceilings and walls, but the game some times doesn't know what to do with the car if you don't jump or flip exactly as the game wants you to. Instead of making a landing that looked perfectly reasonable, you fly off into the nether, then your car blows up... I hope the developers can make some adjustments in the future and tweak the gravity to be more consistent and user friendly.Distance is in Early Access, but unlike many in the same program Distance feels very complete. It already features a full and robust options and graphics settings, level editor with over 150 user made maps available already, local and online multiplayer, and multiple ways to play the campaign maps. Distance has raised the bar of what gamers can expect from early access games, and this is a good thing.Overall Distance is a very enjoyable arcade racer that will have you pulling your hair out one minute, and in the next, your nose will be touching the screen with focus and determination. It's a hell of a ride. Pros:- Great visuals and audio- Fast and visceral gameplay- Challenging- Tons of interesting ideas- Feels extremely complete for an early access (Beta 3297)Cons:- Gravity feels wonky at times- Can be frustrating at first			"

								Distance is a really fun game and has you dodging and diving between objects to reach your final goel. the adventure mode has a great experiance that will push you and challenge you to start with, once you have mastered that, sadly there is not musch else to challenge you besides the workshop. This does not mean there is no more content because oh boy is there more content. there are random geniration maps so that is infinate fun and also challenge mode and user maps, so yeah there is a lot.BUT the game really leaves me craving more speed and more split secound decisions. i really feel that they should make the tracks a tiny bit wider and add more speed and faster handeling later on in the game. i love the game and i love the small challenges it offeres but at the moment after playing it for a little while i feel i have mastered it and i just really want more speed and variation.TLDRGame is fun with a lot of contentfun to get good at, can bore when masteredneeds more speed with better handeling (only add better handeling if more speed is added)limited variationshort tracksIm going to give this game a thumbs up, because i really enjoy it and its great fun to play, i just feel that it has the possibility to be a great deal better if it was made harder with longer tracks and more speed.

			Steam Store Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/233610		

Quick Impressions: Initially the game feels kind of slow even when you have that blur-thing happening. But the first few stages are tutorials getting you accustomed to the game. Even though the game never actually gets any faster, the obstacles thrown in front of you creates a very real feeling of speed. Looking back at my LP, it does seem slow, but when I was playing, it was hectic.There is a nice magnetic grip to the car. It's not way overpowered, it's tuned very nicely and helps with all of the crazy go-nuts car flipping to perpendicular roadways. I've already seen some speed runs and I'm excited to see what comes of it.There are already UGC for the levels!  http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/workshop/ Which is NUTS!  Really cool that there is so much UGC on day one when the game launches.  Easily has to be some kind of record. I toyed around with the level editor at the end of my LP and I have no idea what I'm doing, but it seems fairly simple after you get the hotkeys situated in your head.Lastly, I want to mention that there is a very real kernel of a story present in Distance.  Which is kind of odd, because you usually don't expect stories in racing games.  But something is definitely up.All told this game is precision racing.Excellent job from the Nitronic Rush guys!			"

								The most inventive and original racing game I've played in quite some time; Distance is an Incredibly fast and highly-engaging arcade racer with stunning Tron-esque graphics and audio.The adventure mode is truly unique as you attempt to 'survive' a series of monolithic tracks full of bizarre hazards like buzzsaw blades, laser grids, portals, spaceships and more. There's alot of mechanics to master - like boosting, jumping and flying - but Refract have managed to tie them together in a seamless/rewarding fashion. There's also arcade, multiplayer, track editor and community support so there's plenty to enjoy with Distance in its current Early Access form.Highly recommended for fans of games like Burnout, Split Second, Need for Speed and TrackMania.

You can set up the controls to have control over every little movement and setting you like, or keep it simple and standard.  The music is fantastically produced, and the level editor is easy to use once you figure it out.  Workshop puts out some great tracks, and the community is as friendly and helpful as could be.  I'd reccomend this game to literally everyone that plays more than just FPS.			"

								Best Game Ever.Pros- Graphics are amazing- Level design is outstanding- Soundtrack is amazing (don't like it? Add Your Own Music!)- Playable with both Keyboard and Mouse, but a controller is best- Amazing physics and easy to navigate menusCons- Still Early Access- Not to many updates (few and far between)- Multiplayer Lobbies are often non existant (but if you have some friends that also own the game, you can create a Private Match to play)- VERY STEEP learning curve It's truly a amazing game, but the levels are difficult (except for starter levels), the game is often Hectic, and it can be frustrating. This game is overall good, not too many things that ruin it. Get it if you like games that are crazy, fun, and awesome.Time Posted: June 29th, 2016 9:44 PM			"

								Great game. Since the early prototype i tried it again and again, and it's improving all the time. It's coming together really well! I like the twisted racing mechanics, and the also some really neat ideas in the track layout and shifts in mood along the tracks/sync to the bg music. However, sometimes it's difficult to handle the challenges right away. I'd like to master the jump, rotate, friction controls for example - there might be potential for ""less cluttered"" open fun park style levels, without a linear track. I think there's already something in there... need to try again!			"

								Anyone who's played the free game titled Nitronic Rush will feel right at home with Distance.  In fact, Distance is being developed as the spiritual successor (sequal) to Nitronic Rush.  And what a fantastic sequal it is.  Here are my opinions on the game as a Kickstarter backer (beta).Pros:-Superb graphics/environment.  The theme of the levels is fantastic (almost Tron-esque), and the music goes with the environment very well.  Light will pulse along with the music, and the overfall feeling is just fabulous.-Excellent handling.  The cars handle beautifully, and really are easy to drive but hard to master.  Mechanics such as boosting (which has a heating system a la Motorstorm), jumping, and flying are all implemented very well.  The levels often utilize these too, creating for a unique driving expirience.-Challenge.  Distance is fun for just your average racer, but it has a suprising depth for speedrunners.-Level editor.  Have not used this much personally, but you can see by other people's fantastic creations that it works well.Cons:-Content.  The game's in beta, so I can't be too harsh here.  However, at the time of writing this you can complete the story in an hour or so.  -Level editor.  While very robust, it's not particularly easy to use.  Tutorials can be found on Youtube; they help.If you enjoy racing games, challenging games, or speedrunning games I strongly recommend picking this up.  I have been anxiously awaiting this game since it was announced and it's been anything but dissapointing.			"

Early Access Review
								Distance is quite easily the best Early Access game I have played in the last two years.There is one simple reason behind this: IT WORKS!TLDR OR SEE MY VIDEO BELOW : Distance is a fast paced time trial racer, it has a few different modes available and is opened up to Single player, multiplayer and split screen LAN multiplayer.There are plenty of unique and interesting official maps to keep you busy, but if you set the best times on these there is the extensive community workshop with over 200+ tracks (from date of writing) available to download separately (or all at once).Compete against friends or the global community to try and dominate the leaderboards. ------ FULL REVIEW ------ Adventure Mode:The game sports an adventure mode where you race your car through the official maps in as quick a time as possible while avoiding all the crazy lasers, buzz saws and twisting and winding roads while preventing your car from overheating by quickly getting through the next checkpoint.Although there isn't a story per se the tracks are highly immersive and draw you into what can only be classified as a dystopian city scape. Throughout the adventure you seem to move from a potentially busy vibrant city into a dark lost society. If you put your imagination to it I am sure you can come up with some interesting scenarios as to what happened to this world!Arcade:Arcade mode is where it really gets interesting. There are a few modes to choose from:Sprint: Basically get to the end of the track as quickly as possible to get your name on the global scoreboards. Go through checkpoints to prevent the car from overheating. Reset if you screw up too badly and push yourself to the limit to gain the fastest time possible! (this mode counts towards global leaderboards).Stunt: Try to do as many flips, flights and wall rides as possible within the time limit to gain the greatest score. This is played in an arena mode with plenty of ramps and heights to get the maximum amount of flips in before that inevitable landing, just be sure to land upright or the subsequent landing may be more of an explosion!Reverse Tag: There is an orb which must be collected. Each player will compete to steal the orb from the other player. Whoever can keep the orb for the longest time will win. This is played in an arena style map which has plenty of cheeky little areas to try and trip your competitors up.Workshop:From the date of writing there are over 200 community created tracks to try out. There are different tracks designed for each individual mode. Each track varies in length and difficulty with some sprints taking less than a minute, to first time tries clocking in at over 10 minutes.One problem with the workshop currently is everyone must have downloaded the community maps themselves, they don't just download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a ""subscribe to all mods"" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.Track Editor:The game ships with its own in game track editor which provides all the tools you need to create some really exciting / wacky tracks which you can then upload to the Steam workshop and let others race and rate. There is massive room for some truly exciting and unique track experiences.Leaderboards:The leaderboards are what help to make this game what it is. You can see times set by the top 1000 in the global community but also filter down to personal best times and friends. If like me you want to be at the top of your friends leaderboards you should definitely give this game a try!Controller:The front of Steam says the game has partial controller support although while using my Xbox controller it seemed to work 100% fine, I was able to re-bind keys however I liked, vibration function works no problems.If you prefer to use the keyboard then this is fine too, again it has 100% re-bind capabilities.---------  CONCLUSION ---------As mentioned at the start this is the best Early Access I have played in a long time. It works flawlessly without any crashes and very few if any bugs. One issue I have noticed is when watching another person finish a race it can get stuck playing the same loop, however this isn't game breaking and when they finish / the timer runs out the game will continue as usual.One small problem with the community maps is every person wanting to race online must have individually downloaded the maps. They don't download from the host. There is however a quick solution to this on the workshop with a ""subscribe to all mods"" tool which allows you to instantly subscribe to all the tracks available.The game is still in beta and already I would say 8.5/10 I can't give it more because the adventure mode is not yet finished and the issues with online downloading of maps. But it is well on its way to becoming a fantastic game which could give hours of fun and frustration!

								This is an oddball. I purchased this on a whim during the Christmas sale and was pleasantly surprised. This is a small Alpha version of a high octane Wipeouty influenced alternate dystopian reality racer. Whew. Honestly I have no idea what it is. It's basically an insanely fast racer where twitch reflexes reign supreme. The game itself is quickly easy to master and theres only one car that comes in a few different colors. The official track selection is rather small too but theres a massive amount of great user made tracks free for download on the Steam Workshop.To be honest the creators rarely ever update this game, and I honestly never see this coming out of early access but it's a cheap thrill to be had and an okay overall experience. I wouldn't pay over $10USD for it though. Buy it on sale.			"

								Distance feels like a wipeout-like game. While the ""car"" (there is only one) is not as cool as the pods of wipeout, the tracks + sound-track is phenomenal. The game succeeds in delivering a very high paced racing game.-The additional control options (jumping, boosting forward, ""boosting down"", flying) are a clever additon-crazy objects like portals are a very nice upgrade from wipeout-like games.-graphics are supporting the player to find the right way, while the speed is insanely high.

								Not 100% sure about the $20 price-tag. But I'm damn sure this is worth the sale price I got it for. I've only got 7.5 hours so far, but I'm going to enjoy this game for a long time. The community levels/support is probably what will keep this game fresh for me even longer than the SFRUSH series (back in muh day). The game is very polished as I would expect for something that's been ""out"" for 2 years. One complaint I have is the slightly lazy turning physics... at extremely low speeds the turning radius for the car is absurdly huge which makes recovering from a slide into a wall much more arduous and difficult than it needs to be. The only other whinging I can do is over lack of styling/car choices. It'd be nice to have more vehicle choices (preferably with limited tunable stats to suit play-style/track-specific setups).			"

								An amazing game! Distance is oozing with style. Fantasic art, clever game mechanics - boost, jumps and even flying is incorporated enabling you to stunt in order to survive the visually incredible and thoughtful crafted maps with their changes of gravity and obstacles (including razors and lasers trying to cut you in bits at times). The gameplay is absolutely fluent and real fun using a controller, very responsive.There are different game modes;  Adventure (sort of campaign) and Arcade with sprint, speed & style, challenge and stunt, offering solo, split screen and online playOfc there is also a level editor and lots of custom maps already available.And not to forget the great soundtrack. Fits perfectly.A great way to test and train your reflexes. The first maps are easy and introduce you to the gameplay, and the later expert ones are pretty challenging, if you wanna get a good score and a gold medal. ;)Before I forget: I haven't encountered any bugs so far, so no worries about its early access state.

								Distance is a really good racing game. The car handles really well in both driving and flying mode, and gives you the chance to learn new techniques in order to improve your track times. The base game comes with a kinda limited amount of tracks, but thankfully the steam workshop contains many excellent new ones.If you like time trials and leaderboards, this game will have you constantly retrying the same track over and over till you set the best time you can, only for you to then realise that track is just a guideline through the course, making you have to learn a whole new route to get gud.

								This game is very interesting, none the less. Even if your taste is not in racing games, it is a good pass time if you're overwhelmed from playing that Multiplayer game you typically play when you wake up in the morning. God knows when I am annoyed after playing Rust or Counter Strike: Global Offensive that it's these games I like to turn to. Overall, Distance has very many wonderful mechanisms to it. Gravity being a very affected party of this game; you need to understand how the physics of this game works if you want to play it properly. Once you get the hang of everything, however, you start to receive a lot of enjoyment out of playing the maps that are preset in the game, and even custom ones made by the community. Not only does Distance have wonderful mechanics to it, but it also has a nice developmental structure to it, and what I mean by that is it includes its own level editor, and you can make maps, such as a Rainbow Road and a Mario Kart map I've already took the liberty of playing on. I can say that this game is very enjoyable as a ""I have spare time and I'm not doing too much,"" type of game. Almost like listening to music or watching Netflix while you're idling in your game server trying to get rid of that TF2 item you don't like.The only problem I have with this game is the Multiplayer. You have to set up your own server and typically invite people to your game, because there are not a lot of random public servers to play on. They are all typically private for friends or a group of people. If they had a matchmaking feature like Left 4 Dead 2 does, then that would make Multiplayer a bit more appealing in my eyes.Overall, I do enjoy this game, and hope that it's carried out in development further than what it is now.Wonderful potential here, just don't end up like a lot of other Early Access games that are, very unfortunately, ""In early access"" for two and a half years and never actually goes anywhere often. Yes, that was a shot at DayZ. Sorry!			"

								Current Edit:  Having put a few hours into Distance, I can safely say my money was worth it, but for reasons many others may not benefit from, but hopefully a few may.   I suffer pretty severly from panic attacks (often leading to mild seizures) from time to time, mostly at night after dreaming about situations more ♥♥♥♥ed up than Im willing to describe.  I wake up sweating, my chest in a vice, diaphram contorted demonically, mind racing, heart about to explode...  I stumble out of bed, into my chair and manage to flick on my audio interface, boot up my computer and log in to steam.   Distance only takes a few moments to start and the music is soothing.  I always start with the first track, I forget the name... Broken Symmetry?  Regardless, the slow build up of piano, filter-modulated white/pink noise and easy curves wittle away at my stress.  Upon finding a sense of calm, meditative trance begins to set in.  The beat kicks up and I find myself no longer panicking, but positively charged, ready for challenge. My adrenaline flips polarity to positive and I am back to being ME.  No worries, no stress, no job, no lonliness.  Just pretty lights and sounds, a simple goal, and a sense of peace.  I have not tried any workshop tracks, but I would love to see something in the form of straightaway tracks like the first few, with little challenge and more empahsis on cinematic thrill.Initial Review-------Playing this game is what I imagine driving a Tesla might feel like.Sexiest sight/sound match in a racing game since Extreme GAdventure needs to be more.. erm, adventerous... I loved the build up intro but it was the same as arcade otherwise.  Maybe there could be some enemy responsible for the obstacles, cliche but it would be cool to have some depth. I would also love to see some sort of upgrade system or at least some aesthetic customization, it would make 20 dollars seem acceptable.  I got it on sale at 15 and it's still a stretch of money at this point in the development, that being said I do not regret the purchase at all.Will update.			"

								I haven't taken the time to review that many games in the past, however, this game was too good to pass up giving attention.Its been awhile since arcade racers were in their prime. People are lost to the unrealistic stupid fun genre that is arcade racers, Distance by Refract Studios didn't only remind me of that same rediculous fun I used to have in arcades, but grew on it in so many wonderful ways.in 2011 the small indie studio released Nitronic Rush, a fun experiment using a physics engine built entirely by them in C++, and it was awesome. I got my friends to download it and they all loved it, it was such a refresher from the generic races that have been coming out in years past, the ammount of insanity involved is something I hadn't dealt with in a long time.Then came Distance, made by the same studio under the name Refract, and it gave me that same rush as the first game. The game has cars going at a rediculous speed, set in a world similar to that of Tron, with flying cars, stunts, an amazing multiplayer and one of the most challenging but entertaining single player's i've been offered in a long time.If you're on the edge about this game, just know you wont be dissapointed, Distance is one of the most refreshing experiences i've had in a long time, and im confident Refract Studios can only make it better.

								**Summary: A very good game to race on, but its level editor needs a complete overhaul, in my opinion.**Positives:Excellent graphicsExcellent sound designController supportRacing gameplay feels fantastic to doWide variety of community made levels of varying challengesThorough options menu with ways to compensate for less powerful rigsNegativesLevel EditorI'm not going to devote time to explaining Distance's graphics and whatnot to you, you can see them easily in the trailers, which, from my playing of it, reflect the game as it is. I also will say that I can't stand the keyboard controls for the game, but that's just me. Try it yourself.The racing gameplay is fast and fairly easy to pick up. Running through the tutorials once should teach you everything you need to know. I do wish there were better, crunchier sound effects for vehicles hitting things (especially on landing a jump), but that's just me being a bit nitpicky.This game's main issue (in my opinion, of course) is its level editor.Ooh boy. That UI. It's an absolute clusterfrak of buttons, poorly organized pieces and annoying camera control. Stretching, squashing, scaling and rotating pieces feels finicky at the best of times. Not to mention it has the major problem of making it extremely difficult to tell where anything is in relation to anything else.No, I do not think it's acceptable for a game that banks so heavily on user-created content to have such an annoying toolset to use. It's not like a lot of this couldn't be fixed, either - just organizing the pieces in something that vaguely resembles a logical manner would be a great start. Why is the *End* piece near the top of the selection, and why is the *Start* piece buried much further down? Why aren't they right up front? This is just one example of what I mean - there's plenty more where that came from.The icons also often don't do the best job conveying what piece you're actually clicking on, and the text is all strung together into one blurb - stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like this should not be this way. At all.And before you say ""There are guides available,"" I will say that a game that banks as heavily on its toolset as Distance does should have a UI that's intuitive enough for a person who's never touched or looked at the game before to be putting levels together within a couple of minutes.Try to imagine, for instance, if something like Planet Coaster or Trackmania had a track editor that, rather than being user-friendly to the point a person who's never played a video game could get a handle on how it worked, was instead a headache-inducing mess. Those games would be awful just because of that - so why does Distance's level editor have this problem?What the hell does this game gain by its level editor being as confusing and frustrating to use as it is? Nothing, that's what.Overall, I would buy this game to race. The level editor is utterly unintuitive and I find it's a headache to do the simplest tasks with it.But the actual racing, flying, jumping and whatnot feel fantastic - though I prefer a controller for it.

								The game is very pretty and kinda interesting (if you can have fun alone against the track), I do recommend the game.But let me warn anyone thinking about getting it for VR: do not get it only for the VR. You will not have a good time.VR performance is good, works well, interface support is top notch... But the gameplay is not suited for VR. Too many bumps, camera shakes, unpredictable sudden changes of motion, spins in every direction, visual refraction and color distortions, All that very fast. The abstract tracks that curves vertically are nice, but in VR you feel every polygon collision.Again: the game is great and you should play it, but you do not want it just to increase your VR library.(disclaimer: please use this review only if it applies to you)			"

								I've had an eye on this since I first found Nitronic Rush ages ago, and only finally broke down and bought it when I caught it in the Humble Store's sale for half off.It's absolutely wonderful, to say the least.The driving handles infinitely better than in Nitronic Rush, at least in my experience, remaining familiar enough that I grasped it without problem. The soundtrack is as brilliant as that of its predecessor, leaving me searching for a place to purchase or download it.There are many other things here that I could go on about, but I needn't.

I'm not liying when I say I died multiples times on some tracks. Like the game itself says is a survival racing game.For an early access game, this game feels like is almost or complete. Stunning visuals amazing music, if you like the type of racing game with an futuristic-style or a TRON style this is your game.The game is also well optimized, it runs smoothFor 9.99 is worth the price.

								Imagine you have a boring normal car. Now you get to paint your car whatever colors you want. Might as well throw in a back booster and the ability to jump. Now add in some lasers, crushers and buzz saws and scatter them all around an alien world straight outta space. Track is gone? Oh well, might as well drive on the walls - maybe even pull off a sweet trick while you're at it. Falling towards your demise because you just totally failed that triple backflip? Well admire the beautiful scenery and pretty lights, then open up your WINGS and fly back up to try and survive just a little bit longer. Yes, that thing IS trying to kill you.			"

								Sci-fi Arcade racing at its best since the golden age of gaming. Distance has a fantastic theme, bringing Tron-esque styles to twisting tracks, gravity swapping jumps and devastating obstacles that can literally leave you with a small portion of your car left to scrape over the finish line (or check point), regenerating it ready to go.The music, style, graphics and controls all feel very well polished and add a great atmosphere to the game and while the campaign is not massively in-depth, it is not yet finished and does give a decent challenge to new and veteran players alike.The level creator is a well-built and friendly tool that allows anyone to easily create their own levels to share and is one of the best level editors I have seen in a while.Overall, very fun alone or with friends, with different online modes to keep you entertained.Highly recommended even if you are not really a racing fan, definitely worth the price.

								Like many, I had played Nitronic Rush, a game developed by the creators of Distance as a college project. And, like many, I fell in love with the sense of speed and control, as well as the impressive attention to quality these unpaid students had shown. If you are not sure about purchasing Distance, I urge you to try Nitronic Rush first. Now on to the review, which will be in simple slices from this point on:Gameplay:+Great sense of speed+Wow factor very high+Ability to be stylish+Extremely hectic but fun and skill based multiplayer-Occasional Gravity quips, but mostly as solid as nitronic rushGraphics:+Stunning enviornments+Great in motion or a still screenshot+Stylized world portrays the mood of the adventure mode well. Speaking of which...Story:+A visual adventure with great portrayal  of mood+Still in beta, so improvements and overall increase in narrative are likely+Music conveys most of the messageMusic:+I love it+You want more explanation? Okay+Electronica, progressive house, and dubstep fused together.+Sound good?+You betLasting appeal:+Workshop support for hundreds of levels+Still in beta, expect more content!-As of now, lacking enough to keep you busy for more than a couple days. Will improve with time most likelyOverall, team Nitronic (Now known as Refract Studios) is raising the standard for the racing genre.Much like Sonic the Hedgehog gave the platformer genre a faster, fresher experience to the platformer genre, Distance is the new way to experience the high speed thrills of a racing game.The Distance Beta gets a whopping9/10 for Pre ReleaseAnd a predicted10/10 GoTY for 2015 racing enthusiasts.

								Just finished the 'story' mode in under 2 hours. There is alot of hype surrounding this game - and it is fairly well justified. The graphics are killer, and the music is perfect. Its really fun. There are some cool flying/flipping mechanics that feel great with a controller - overall controls are really tight. Lots of great graphics options too.My only complaint is the price for the content available now. I am less interested in the level editor right now, but thats a good start. The multiplayer didn't work for me, but I am not knocking the game for that - I didn't try too hard, and it is an indie title.Overall, this is one of the better race titles I have played in a long time. Even for the steep *ish* price, I don't regret it for a second.			"

								Ever since I was little, I was a huge fan of the Burnout racing game series. I played those games a lot over the course of a few years. Those games, however, made me create a standard for all racing games. If I felt a certain racing game did not meet that standard, I wouldn't buy it. In fact, In the past 7 years, I have only bought and played 2 other racing games besides Burnout. One of those, I didn't like, the other one is decent. When I saw this game, I was intriqued. It looked unique, but I still went by my standard. I decided that 10 dollars (on sale) was a fair price and purchased it. When I started playing, I realized this game did not meet any of the standards I had set. That was because this game was truly unique. It's nothing I have experienced before. I've only played this game for a few hours so far, and haven't even scratched the surface of what you can do in this game.The graphics in this game are stunning and it is well optimized as well. I can run everything on ultra and get 50+ fps. Even though it says Early Access, I have not encountered any bugs. It's labeled Early Access mostly because they have more content to add. If you enjoy using a controller like myself, they have good controller support as well. It has a level editor, allowing you to make custom levels and then share them on the Steam Workshop. It has nearly unlimited levels, just type in a phrase, and it will generate a random level. It has multiplayer, allowing you to play with others on any map you want. It also has a singleplayer and split-screen mode. And to top it all off, it's only 20 bucks (not on sale), which makes it even better.To be honest, I can't really think of any bad things to say about this game. If I encounter anything, I will update this review.In conclusion, this game is a unique racing experience unlike anything I've played before. There are so many good things about this game, and the developers are continuing to add more content. I highly recommend this game to support it as it develops.			"

As an avid flight simulator player the flight controls are just so wrong that i keep crashing everywhere, the pitch and turning controls are all messed up, Im used to roll and pitch ""up"" to go to the sides (eg, i want to go right, i roll 90º right and then press the pitch up button wich will make me turn right) instead I go UP and that confuses my ace wannabe brain. I tried several  controls config with no success. If im configuring it wrong please tell me. if not I request to ""fix/add"" this feature to the flight controls.			"

It's bigger than that.It's about stretching the mental capacity of the player - and it doesn't require ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of menus or items - all you need: is the car, and some mental dexterity.You drive in crazy loops, jump, fly around your own axis, you flip, bend, twist - and hopefully: land.

YouTube™ Video: Distance's Tracks - Rainbow Road By Krispy 

			Views: 14		

			I would just like to once again give the person behind this ""Krispy"" another shoutout for this amazing level. If you don't know what Rainbow Road is, Go buy a N64, Get Mario Kart, and play this track...		

Here's why I think this game is good.I really never played a game like this before. Maybe Trials Evolution but this game by far is better than that game. Distance brings the intense back to racing. I'm so use to racing on some real life tracks but Distance is so much more better than that. When you very first play it and can be a little difficult but once when you know what you are doing then it ends up being the greatest. I really feel like a game like this can really help your reaction to stuff around you while playing driving games. Probably only downfall is that you only got one car and it sounds like it doesn't have a engine. Probably in the future I would like to see something like that but other than those 2 downfalls this game by far is the best racing game on Steam and I am so glad to get this game in the Early Access stage so I can see this game progress. I highly recommend if you like racing games you should no doubt play this game and see the amazing levels the community has created and even the missions the devs have created.			"

								This game still misses a lot. It's more of the concept, than a finished game.But it's really fun. Pure arcade. This game gives you some kind of a supercar with player-friendly vehicle physics and some crazy tracks to drive. Your car can jump, drive on walls even fly. It can regenerate instantly when you're passing the green checkpoint even after being cut in half with a laser. And there are a lot of lasers, razor discs and other stuff, that wants to cut, smash or burn your car. And a lot of places to do some crazy stunts.			"

Distancetl;dr: A good racing game, a bit shortThe full review: Distance is a futuristic survival racing game, in which you try to race to the end of each level without being obliterated by the ever so many threats. All in all, I believe the developers did quite a good job at delivering.However, it still feels a little too focussed on racing and not enough on survival, which I would like to have seen more.As for Early Access: The Adventure Mode is indeed a little on the short side (about 1 hour of playtime), but it was definitely fun and quite mysterious - as the game gives you very little narrative. Who are you? Why are you racing? What is the corruption?In general, if you like racing games like TrackMania, you will likely enjoy playing this game!			"

								***OPEN BETA REVIEW***A fantatically designed game. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and all the neon cityscapes that the game generates are honestly eye-boggling. The driving controls feel very smooth and easy to learn - the tough part is mastering it and beign able to maneuver the vehicle through some ridiculously hectic and action-packed tracks. Soundtrack is quite good, actually, very fitting, and all the lights actually pulse to the music with a certain setting turned on. You can even give the game a directory, and it will play any MP3 music files you have there instead of the EDM/dubstep norm. Very creative and awesome special effects and innovative ideas I've never seen brought into the racing videogame world until now, including a gamemode that randomly generates a track and environment based on a random phrase that you input. This product is very well-polished, ESPECIALLY for a beta. All it's really missing is content. I got this game on sale, but I am almost positive that it will be well-worth the $20-asking price on its full release.			"

								Fantastic level design, high speed tracks that are essentially puzzles, very fitting music, workshop support, being able to mess up so hard that you fly off the track and are able to explore the geometry and even possibly recover, physics based vehicle damage, and a very nice looking cel shading. The only flaw I have is that the Nightmare levels seem a bit out of place. The ending of Adventure mode stating that more levels coming is great. I love games that seemingly break your hardware, but don't really.Edit: After owning the game for over a month, the developer is constantly updating and improving the game.

								Ever wanted to play the role of a Hot Wheels car, only way ♥♥♥♥ing cooler?  This is the game for you.  And you have wings.  FLIPPING WINGS!  Don't be fooled by the Early Access tag, the game is completely playable and ran very smoothly on my old GTX 750 Ti at max settings 1080p, looking beautiful.  Crank down the settings a bit and you could run this on integrated graphics, probably (don't qoute me on that).  My R9 390 has no problems whatsoever.  I still can't get over how cool this game is...  The only gripe is the length of the campaign, but there's a keyword-based random level generator and a level creator with Steam Workshop support, and multiplayer, so the content is infinite, anyway.  The campaign is still a work in progress, I gather.  THIS is what the early access model should be used for.  Huge props to the devs.			"

It was a fun game at first, and the updates keep making it better.And thanks for Linux support!EDIT: Using a Steam Controller is not a fun experience (Linux, or with another controller splitscreen on Windows.  Not sure about OSX.) Native support is in the works, per the developers remarks in the forums. I had my SC improperly configured. It works fine.EDIT2: Turns out this isn't (just) a racing game, it's a 3-D platformer. And I'm getting a lot better at platforming.			"

This game is virtually infinite and well worth even its full price. "

								Ever since I was little, I was a huge fan of the Burnout racing game series. I played those games a lot over the course of a few years. Those games, however, made me create a standard for all racing games. If I felt a certain racing game did not meet that standard, I wouldn't buy it. In fact, In the past 7 years, I have only bought and played 2 other racing games besides Burnout. One of those, I didn't like, the other one is decent. When I saw this game, I was intriqued. It looked unique, but I still went by my standard. I decided that 10 dollars (on sale) was a fair price and purchased it. When I started playing, I realized this game did not meet any of the standards I had set. That was because this game was truly unique. It's nothing I have experienced before. I've only played this game for a few hours so far, and haven't even scratched the surface of what you can do in this game.The graphics in this game are stunning and it is well optimized as well. I can run everything on ultra and get 50+ fps. Even though it says Early Access, I have not encountered any bugs. It's labeled Early Access mostly because they have more content to add. If you enjoy using a controller like myself, they have good controller support as well. It has a level editor, allowing you to make custom levels and then share them on the Steam Workshop. It has nearly unlimited levels, just type in a phrase, and it will generate a random level. It has multiplayer, allowing you to play with others on any map you want. It also has a singleplayer and split-screen mode. And to top it all off, it's only 20 bucks (not on sale), which makes it even better.To be honest, I can't really think of any bad things to say about this game. If I encounter anything, I will update this review.In conclusion, this game is a unique racing experience unlike anything I've played before. There are so many good things about this game, and the developers are continuing to add more content. I highly recommend this game to support it as it develops.			"

As an avid flight simulator player the flight controls are just so wrong that i keep crashing everywhere, the pitch and turning controls are all messed up, Im used to roll and pitch ""up"" to go to the sides (eg, i want to go right, i roll 90º right and then press the pitch up button wich will make me turn right) instead I go UP and that confuses my ace wannabe brain. I tried several  controls config with no success. If im configuring it wrong please tell me. if not I request to ""fix/add"" this feature to the flight controls.			"

It's bigger than that.It's about stretching the mental capacity of the player - and it doesn't require ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of menus or items - all you need: is the car, and some mental dexterity.You drive in crazy loops, jump, fly around your own axis, you flip, bend, twist - and hopefully: land. This game is a true gamer's game.Put short; this is one of the most pleasantly surprising games I've ever found on steam.The community is great, the devs ACTUALLY LISTEN.

Crank down the settings a bit and you could run this on integrated graphics, probably (don't qoute me on that).  My R9 390 has no problems whatsoever.  I still can't get over how cool this game is...  The only gripe is the length of the campaign, but there's a keyword-based random level generator and a level creator with Steam Workshop support, and multiplayer, so the content is infinite, anyway.  The campaign is still a work in progress, I gather.  THIS is what the early access model should be used for.  Huge props to the devs.			"

								Good luck finding another game like this, let alone one as good as this. It was a fun game at first, and the updates keep making it better.And thanks for Linux support!EDIT: Using a Steam Controller is not a fun experience (Linux, or with another controller splitscreen on Windows.  Not sure about OSX.) Native support is in the works, per the developers remarks in the forums. I had my SC improperly configured. It works fine.EDIT2: Turns out this isn't (just) a racing game, it's a 3-D platformer. And I'm getting a lot better at platforming.			"

								Honestly, if the developers stopped working on the game today I'd still feel I got my money's worth.It's a fantastic game that lets you build your own lovely death traps, gauntlets and sprints that you can enjoy with your friends, with a fun challenge mode and a simply GORGEOUS art style.Give it a shot. You won't regret it.			"

								Great graphics/aesthetic. Really digging the glitch stuff that gets thrown in the (short) story mode. Multiplayer isn't too active, but you will almost always find a server. Good level editor, which really brings the Trackmania nostalgia. Tracks are fast-paced and fun. Highly recommended for arcade racing fans. (and hey, who knows, newcomers as well)			"

								I crashed a lot in the beginning. I still crash even now and I've figured out most of the controls. The game is beautiful and the concept is awesome. It can be a bit daunting because the gameplay is centered around reflex in some areas but once you get into the zone and master driving it gets easier. The first person view is even crazier than the third person and personally I find it easier to control my car, from the first person view, even though having spacial awareness from this view is a bit difficult. All in all it's a awesome game. The music gets you pumped once it gets going. I feel like this game is a hell child born from a threesome Rocket League(with it's car jumping mechanics and boosts), Burnout(because it's the only game I can recall that's environment could really bone you over) and Tron.9/10 Would crash into lasers again.

								Although still in development, this game is awesomeIf you liked Hotwheels' Acceleracers or anything like that as a kid, you'll love every second of this high-speed, frantic, very well made game.The graphics are on point, as well as the dynamic soundtrack. There is still only one car option, although customizable color-wise, but they'll eventually add more I suppose, as it was with Nitronic Rush.The levels are always fun to sprint and trick through, and the later ones WILL be challenging. No matter what your skill level with racing games is.You'll see that I've not played that many hours of the game on steam, but that's because I've already played a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of it through unofficial means, and finally decided to show my support and gratitude to the developers.TL;DR: The game is awesome, has pretty good compatibility and is definitely underrated, GO PLAY IT! :^)			"

								So far through the early access the game is great. It has cool physics, looks fantastic and awesome music. It leaves me wanting for more of a story mode that is not avliable at the time of writing the review. (7/18/2016). The game also has a functioning multiplayer which works great and syncs very well with people online. The steam workshop for custom tracks is awesome as people have made tons of maps (wether they are good or not is up to you). The game has potential but it needs to be further expanded. The Devs seem to be here and enjoy what they are doing. So i would expect further updates.(Quick side note, it has virtual reality support so you can go first person in the car while you drive which is cool AF lol, like driving a futuristic car in a hotwheels crazy world. You can also drive in first person mode while not having any virtual reality equipment but i dont think it would be as cool) If you have ever seen the TV/Movie series ""Hot Wheels Highway 35"" and ""Hot Wheels The Acceleracers movies 1-4"" . It feels as if it were inspired by the movies as it has similar car design choice and level design. But that just may be a complete  coincidence. This is just a positive note from my side it makes the game feels nostalgic in a way because i watched the movies as a kid.			"

								I´m recommending this game, even thinking the game looks abandoned, because I think the price versus the content that the game already have, worth it. I said abandoned because it has being passed more than 3 months since the last update. In my opinion, for an early access game, it is too much. But I don't follow the developers, maybe they are planning to release a big update in the near future. Anyway just keep in mind that this game does not receive updates too often.One more thing to consider before buy it is: when I said that the content worth, is mainly because of the modes that allows you to play with your friends. But I do not recommend for whose are just interested in Single Player mode, at current stage it is too short and incompleted, although it is fun and promising.Hope this help.			"

								I find it crazy how such a good game is so below the radar. For only $20 you get a bunch of amazing tracks from the Workshop to sink your time into thanks to the great community this game has. It's a fun and thrilling experience with a great soundtrack and multiple game modes to choose from like Sprint, Stunt mode and the work in progress Adventure/story mode. The game looks stunning as well with it's sci-fi theme while at the same time not being too demanding on your computer. The only gripe I have is the fact that it has such a small playerbase so you'd have to hop on the weekends when they hold play sessions to find people online easier. Which is a shame since it's not the game's fault, just not really a well known title on steam : / On the good news, that doesn't affect people who just want to chill and survive the tracks/get the best times on their own. For a game that offers more content than a AAA title (thanks to the workshop/community content) it's certainly worth the price.			"

								Distance is a mysterious, neon styled racing game set in space, somewhere above earth a long time from now. The general goal is to reach the finish, go fast and avoid various hazards on your way. Your space car comes equipped with a nitro boost that refills when landing stunts or driving through checkpoints, a set of wings that also use your boost meter to fly and a killer suspension system that makes sharp turns and airborne maneuvering easy. The stunt game mode deviates from this general goal as you only rely on GOOD STUFF like doing as many ASTOUNDING stunts as possible in a set amount of time to get you GOIN' THE DISTANCE. Distance is still in early access but it's already perfectly playable, there just aren't many official levels yet. However, thanks to the level editor and Steam Workshop, you currently have 885 custom made levels at your disposal... plenty of gameplay. So far I've tried several of the higher rated ones and they were all great.There's also a neat Transmogrify game mode that creates a random map based on what you write. Try ""super long never ending ride"". Spoiler alert: it ends and it's not even that long but it's got a great, sinister atmosphere about it. Everything fits.The kicking soundtrack fits the game perfectly. There's also an option to import and listen to your own music while you play. There are a lot of options.That said, I have a few minor complaints. I think the beatbox sound mode would be better if there was no screen shake and just a bigger emphasis on the blinking lights. I also miss the over the top announcer from Distance's predecessor - Nitronic Rush. I understand that the game is a bit more serious, lonesome and mysterious this time around. In fact, I really dig the whole space neon-machine atmosphere but If they added the announcer as an off by default or at least stunt mode only audio option, that'd just make the game BETTER THAN SLICED BREAD.

								The ambiance. The concept. The visuals. The simple pleasure of driving a futuristic, bouncing, nitro-equipped flying car around.This game is Distance, a game where your goal is to beat levels. Wether it be by speedrunning, scoring points, or simply not dying.Distance comes with a campaign. Short, unfinished, and with (basically) no replay value.But Distance also comes with the Steam Workshop. And a level editor. What does this mean ? It means thousands of user-created levels for you to enjoy !1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

								i really recommend you try this gameThis game is a survival racing game which mean you can die.. I heard a lot of people had played a very similar game to this, so if you one of them, tell me more.. This game has a lot to going on.. and the multiplayer is becoming active again especially when there is sale..There is a few flaw here and out but overall is just really good..The graphics are nice, the level are difficult and the leaderboard sure add a little competive in there..with people constantly making workshop level, you can never end this..plus with the level editor, make one.. its easy to use Trackmogrify is randomly generated level with a phrase..Like minecraft, type a phrase and it randomly generate..Plus there is reverse tag mode, which is quite fun to payAnd stunt mode which you make a lot of pointsLastly, challenge.. no checkpoint, just pure difficult levels..Now stop reading and get it.. if you dont like it, refund XD			"

								Distance feels like a game that should have been around for decades. If it had been a contemporary of WipEout it might have shared that game's halcyon techno and Designer's Republic aesthetic. Instead Distance soaks in retro cyberpunk, floating Brutalist monoliths with refracted Tron: Legacy trim, menacing the twisting ribbons of future-road that are the treacherous way through them. This is pure arcade thrills, Burnout-boosting down a glass and neon highway that flips upside down while you ceiling-ride past hell's own road works equipment through an impossible cyberpunk nightmare city to a pounding electronic soundtrack. Despite being in Early Access there's a healthy game here already, with multiple modes and tracks for days in this unique cyber-horror score-chaser.			"

								Cooler than Nitronic Rush! Faster than Nitronic Rush! Dynamically than Nitronic Rush! In Distance is all that was missing in Nitronic Rush! Cutting the car in half(This is brilliant)! Speed, music, dynamic, action and adrenaline, these sensations you experience playing both games. But if Nitronic Rush only set this threshold, then the Distance jumped above, it means that the developers have outdone themselve. Welldone!)But that's not the full game!!! I can only imagine what will end PRODUCT TO!The game is excellent, from all sides: music, graphics, physics, objects, textures, lazers and saws!!! Everything here is top notch(In my view).I recommend to all fans of this genre of games (especially if you've played Nitronic Rush).I will look forward to future updates and enjoy Torcht's music!!!

								Distance has a real pick up and play game style, the campaign rewards you with straight in action that you can pick up your progress from quickly. The campaign plays to its strengths well using some quite novel ways to introduce players to new features. Multiplayer can get boring quite quickly, I have not found a way to turn collisions back on with all players ghosting through each other, I hope this changes in future development as a toggle function would be great.The Seed geenrating does keep things interesting, using words to generate maps in quick succession			"

								The game is really fun. It's basically about Racing through a track with a futuristic car that can not only drive, but fly. The game itself has amazing graphics and usually performs really well. I almost always have over 60FPS on my R9 290. It may run a little bit laggy on weak systems though.Also, for an early access game, this one works really well. It's not plagued by bugs. Sure, there may be some minor ones, but after all, the fact that lets you know for sure it's early access is the title screen that says ""BETA"".EDIT: Play this game on shrooms. I ♥♥♥♥ing dare you.

								I AM SORRY, I AM EXTREMELY TIRED RIGHT NOW [life story], SO IF I AM RAMBLING IN MY SENTENCES, PLEASE FORGIVE ME INTERNET!""You're not forgiven."" This game is just AMAZING!  I think I did that header right but aside from that, this game is just awesome. The game itself is a good idea, it's entertaining, very well detailed, and multiplayer too. I think my favorite parts are the TrackMogrify and the custom map creation pieces. The other sections are really entertaining too, the Adventure mode has a story if you understand it, and the Arcade has many things you can do from Sprint racing, to Style races. What again makes this better is the fact that you can play on multiplayer servers. So if that wasn't enough enjoyment, you can now scream at the other guy who beats you countless times on every track as you break your computer in half with a chainsaw.So in short, here are the things I love about it!1. The Game itself.2. The Custom Track Generation (TrackMogrify)3. The detail of the game4. The Custom Map Creator5. The Mutiplayer modeI really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys racing and adventure type games, it just entertains you when you need it the most.--If you're special and you know it eat a donut.""Do you want to pointlessly explode your car over and over again with the press of a button? No? Well now you can, with the new and improved Reset feature! Just mash that default T-Button over and over again when you start failing that one race! It's pointless, it's uneducational, it's even directed by Micheal Bay! Only for three short payments of five -cough thousand cough- dollars! Don't delay, buy today!""			"

								(This is a review in progress.)A great sequel to the free Nitronic Rush, (Which I also recommend, if you haven't played it, it's free!) even in Early Access it has a lot of content to play with, as well as improved mechanics that still stay true to the original. For those who haven't played Nitronic Rush, you effectively ""drive"" an anti-virus into the heart of a city that's infected in order to cleanse it. As for Distance, it looks like things are much more corrupt. The Adventure Mode hasn't been finished yet, so I'm not sure how that concludes at the moment, but it's really exciting to play a survival racing game.Pros:Improved MechanicsHuge boost in aesthetic details.Nice level-editorMultiplayerCons:I've yet to find any! As always, this is early access, so players might come across some bugs here and there, but I've personally only ever come across one where I fell through the world due to a clipping error, but I've not had any problems since.

Early Access Review
								A technical achievement, with innovative gameplay.  Unfortunately, even if they flesh out the `story mode`, there is little to do in this game other than proceed to the end of each track, each of which seems to be composed of cookie cutter components.  There are no deeper goals, no unlockables, no sense of progress, and no sense of reward.  There's no chaining combos, or learning new moves, or devious AIs, or special challenge levels, just an endless runner that happens to have wheels and loading screens every 3-7 minutes.Am I in love with the controls, the moveset, and the motif? Absolutely.  Can I spend hours browsing the workshop for more levels to add more content? Yes, but custom levels alone cannot expand the experience to the point that this game graduates from tech demo to actual title.  When every level feels like a repeat, and the only game mode is shallow, I can't recommend this as a full priced title.  Sure, the game is in early access, and things could change, but the developers seem pretty clear in their direction, happy with the trajectory and `Overwhelmingly Postivie` feedback so far, so adding depth to the game doesn't seem to be on their radar at all.  If I thought it would change, I would hold off on the negative review and see, but I find the possibility highly unlikely, so I'm going to go ahead and say it's not worth the full price, and it probably won't ever be.In short, the gameplay is amazing, there just isn't a game to go with it.

								This game is Trackmania combined with Need For Speed and TRON and just as good as that combination sounds! It's a unique and really fun racing game with beautiful visuals, tight controls, awesome stunts and level editing, atmospheric music. It's got the works.I'm a beta backer of this game, so I got it for 15 euro. This game right now ( with the -15% 16.99 sale ) is a bargain! If you've ever loved racing games, I don't see any reason to not get this.If you want to play the ""demo"" version of this game, go play it's prequel, Nitronic Rush. It's a little different, but mainly the same game.8.5/10 - Lowered the score simply because it's still early access, so it's lacking some optimization, options and more importantly ( to me ) the old narrator from Nitronic Rush and the music tracks. They have announced that they plan to add the narrator with the original voice actor as an option in the game in the future though, so there's that!			"

								 This is a great racing gaming for any type. Whether you're a speed demon who likes high speed, think-fast gameplay with rapid and precise movement, a dare devil who wants to perform while they race, or just a casual gamer who'd prefer to take a smooth and sweet ride to victory, Distance is definitely for you. Assuming you're into some dubstep and neon, that is. I really can't recommend this enough for anyone who wants a fun racing game.			"

								Amazing mix of car driving, jumping, gliding, boosting, rotating, wallriding, blade and laser dodging, great, electro music and even randomly generated tracks. I don't know how else can I describe this game. If you're either a fan of trackmania, futuristic cars, arcade racing games or just wanna see something that is almost completely new and may just blow your mind away, then you must buy it. This game is in beta stage of development, and except maybe just a little lack of official levels (there are lots of community levels already and seed-generated levels as well), it just feels like a complete product. Oh, and you can add custom music to it, and let some levels flash into beat of it as well. Fancy.			"

I played through what is currently available in the adventure mode and am rather fond of how they delivered the ""sorry this is all we've got right now"" message.

								To start off, I'd like to point out that I do not like most racing games, and I'd also like to point out that Distance is not most racing games. Distance puts you in control of a vehicle that can fly with wings, has jets on all sides, can wall ride, jump, flip, and do anything in between. The controls feel fantastic, the music is amazing, the enviorments are immersive, huge and explorable. There is an adventure mode that acts like the tutorial and tells the story of the game (which is actually quite good, especially when you realize it's being told through a race track), however the real fun begins when you enter the challenge maps of the game. The developers respect player skill and are not afraid to give you a real challenge. Add in community levels and steam workshop, and you'll have replayability and new maps forever. I can't love this game enough, if you feel on the edge about it, I'd highly reccomend trying out Nitronic Rush. It is free and it is the predecessor to Distance. It functions relatively the same as Distance, and will give you a feel for what you can expect from Distance. However, keep in mind that Distance is much more polished, detailed and has a lot of improvements.			"

Some of the workshop content I have experienced is truly epic.The game keeps a good framerate and there are not too many glitches to be found.Overall this is a very good game with huge potential and I really reccommend it.Side Note: It is VERY hard!

								tl;dr If you have VR, buy this game.  Campaign starts slow but will surprise you quickly.  Many game modes including random levels and a level editor, and multiplayer support.  Right stick click resets view in-game.This game is now my second-favorite VR game after Elite Dangerous.  It does have a couple rough bits and the campaign is ""short"" though I found it quite satisfying even at the current length.VR enthusiasts will note that there's many interesting VR games but many of them are a pain to set up and operate; bad control schemes, no positional resets, etc.  This game only has one minor problem in this regard: the reset key/button does not work except during gameplay.  This is the only major problem in the game.  Otherwise, all menus can be operated with a controller or a keyboard, a reset button is available on the controller (Right stick click in), and the game is ready to rock out of the box.FInally, there's a very fun random map generator that I am really impressed by.  You can generate a level with any phrase (Try ""rainbow road"") and you get a unique level.  You can play these levels against other people online too!  And there's a POWERFUL map editor included, and any map you download can be played online as well; the game will automatically send the data to other clients even if they haven't downloaded the map before.I REALLY love this game!

								So.  Distance.  Hmm.  How to describe it?If I were to summarise it in one sentence, it would be ""It's like Dark Souls and Tron had a baby, and the baby was a game which was allegedly a racing game but was actually an adventure game where you play a car in a post-apocalyptic cyberscape"".  Which is certainly an idiosyncratic description, so perhaps I'll go into more details.Graphically, it's gorgeous.  The art design is incredibly strong and the different areas of the city feel very distinctive - and the challenges you'll encounter vary based on sector.  The audio is likewise near pitch perfect.  The controls are tight, and the game always felt fair.  Yes, I died a lot in some sections, but it always felt like it was something I'd done wrong, rather than the game punishing me for bad luck.  That's high praise and speaks well of their design ethos.As it stands, the game is somewhat lacking in content.  I burned through Adventure mode in about an hour.  It was incredibly polished and I encountered no bugs - it's just not very long.  So if you're looking for a full game, hold off until it's out of Early Access.  However, once it's finished and if it lives up to the current high standards, I would freely recommend it.			"

The graphics are good, not the best but you have not much time to look around, and the Vehicle-""slicing"" is a nice gameplaytwist. The real heart of the game are the arcade mode and driving for the best medals on the tracks.Also the community made many levels for the game, which are all well designed and partly can be like Dark Souls on Wheels.

								Just buy it already. It's a lot of fun, especially with a controller. The only downer is that even on my high end rig (5820k, gtx 960, 16gb ram) the game will freeze and stutter on occasion when playing. Might be something to do with the game not bringing all the resources it needs into ram and then looking at the slower ssd for the resources, just a guess.			"

								Distance, the sequel to the great game known as Nitronic Rush. You are are a car in a system, getting from one point to the other.  A very simple concept, but the way it was executed in Distance is simply beautiful. The main point I wish to address in this is that the car can be sliced in various different ways from the dangerous lazers found along the tracks, and you can keep going, even with just two wheels! Even the concept of the car flying is invluded in this game, which adds to the overall experience of the game, making is definitely worthwhile.Though the game is not very large, it is a ton of fun and has the inclusion of steam workshop, which adds to the entire fun of the game, constantly giving you more things to do, and explore and make your own tracks to enjoy with.There isn't much else to mention, the music in the game was fitting, but nothing to be really worth mentioning. The gameplay is smooth, graphics are good, and the variety is great.To me, this game is definitely worth getting, even if it isn't on sale. It is worth the money.			"

								As A kid, I used to watch, a LOT of the old Hotwheels cartoons, and I think that this game (And it's predecessor, Nitronic Rush, which you should definately play before buying this, which you should also do) captures the air of those shows perfectally. It isn't like your normal racing game, of course, you do have a track... because no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherelock, ya gotta drive on something, but the track isn't empty. It isn't a cart racing game either, as there are no weapons except for smashing your opponents into obstacles. What makes this game ""survival racing"" is the fact that the obstacles don't merely make you ""crash"" (which they can do if you hit them at light speed), they can chip away at your vehicle as well. If you cruze through a vertical laser, you're gonna get cut in half. Of course, you can still drive this way, but it isn't exactly a comfortable way to drive, as you've lost all of your previous control. NOW TO THE PROS AND CONSPROS:1. Getting cut up instead of insta death2. Flight, it adds a different dimension to racing3. It tends to run well, and if you're having trouble, just mess around with the settings, and it'll still look beautiful with lower quality graphics.4. THE COMMUNITY TRACKS! Some of them are outstanding, and really fun to mess around in, and the community for this game is amazing. 5. CAR CUSTOMIZATION! Stand out from the croud with your garish Pink and lime green car.CONS:1. The car is a bit, floaty sometimes... maybe a drift mechanic is in order.2. Going quickly can feel a bit... slow, IDK why, but... maybe that's just me. 3. MORE DEV MADE TRACKS PLEASE! The custom bits in them are uniquely awesome.ALL IN ALLYou should get this game. Scroll back up. And hit that button. NOW!  "

								I play Distance with an Oculus Rift, and upon firing it up was initially disappointed by the weird tracks and game mechanics. It's a reaction that I think a lot of players will have at first. But after getting used to the controls, and discovering the random level generator and edited tracks which extend gameplay considerably, I quickly went from disappoint to gleefullly enjoying this game. In fact, I think I have played this game in VR for longer play sessions than what I usually tolerate with a headset on, including relative to stuff like Elite Dangerous. I could probably play this for an hour or two even with a headset on, if I had the time, as it's easy to lose track of time playing random tracks and seeing what other crazy tricks the game can throw at you. For my part, I did not experiene nausea or stomach churning in VR, and the game does not induce my fear of heights as much as a game like Radial G can.  This isn't to say that the VR implementation is better than in standard establishing games like Elite, cause it's not. In fact, the VR adds less to this game than some others like Elite or Radial G, which feel more like VR can be an integral part of the game, rather than an add-on. But if the VR feels like a nice but not revolutionary addition to this game, it's well implemented enough to at least add to the immersion, and may even make the game a little more playable as you can look up to see oncoming parts of the tricky tracks more easily. Just don't expect the same level of presence that some purpose-built for VR games have. This is not like other futuristic VR racing games with some obstacles and the occasional surprise, like the excellent Radial G. It's also not like traditional racers such as the also excellent Project Cars. At least for now, there don't seem to be computer controlled opponents, which is a bit of a disappointment. But what keeps the game interesting is that the game's tracks are, essentially, trying to kill you. While you generally have a chance to respond to things as they occur enough so that absolute track memorization is not necessary, things do start to feel a bit like a puzzle game all the same as you learn to navigate using a mix of odd car abilities from jumping to even flying. Yeah, flying. This game forces you to try all kinds of crazy stunts in order to survive each track's tricky obstacles, including lasers, saw blades, moving walls, and the need to wall climb or fly to reach other levels. At first, this can be frustrating. But it can soon become quite engaging as it all starts to make a weird sort of sense. A gamepad is recommended. And the tracks really are trying to get you. In one random level I generated, a bot-like moving wall hovered above me, following my car until it could pounce down in front of me at just the right moment to score a kill. That's one tricky obstacle! You quickly learn not to take anything for granted while playing this game, as it's more of a survival challenge rather than a conventional racing game. Not all jumps are good to take, turns that look sensible can get you killed, and there are tracks where, instead of only being able to turn left or right at a fork in the road, you also have the option to take a jump right down the middle. Which path is right for you? You can play repeatedly to find out! Come for the pretty colors and Tron-like graphics, and stay for the addictive gameplay.			"

								I've waited for this since first Alpha! It's everything I love in a racing game. Learning curve is great, controls are easy to handle but it's still challanging due to in-game challanges and not due to bad controls, just the way it should be. Love the mid-air movement controls and wall jumping. Would love even more chaos in some levels, but since it's not finished yet I guess it's on its way :) Level creator is not that easy to handle though, too crowded, but I get it just takes some time getting used to. Music and graphics are also great and I love how it has a kind of ""hacker"" feeling to it.			"

								While its advertising describe it like a racing survival game, I would prefer to call it a mix between wip3out and a 3D version of Geometry Dash. And it works so well.Driving in Distance is great, it takes a break from the standard simulation racing and gives you very responseive, fast turning. And when you crash? It still really fun, I intentionally crash into lasers cause it is probably the best looking aesthetic in any game.Speaking of which, Distance also has an amazing art style and music. Get it now.

								This game is a hidden gem that I adore, and the thing is I don't play racing games that often and I tend to not care for them either. However, this one is special. Distance, to describe it simply, is the hotwheels game you've always wished for and/or wanted, was placed into the Tron universe, and implements Burnouts self-destruction to your car, which can fly, jump, and stick to walls.Distance is still in its beta stage and has not finished its story mode, but these brilliant developers made a level editor so detailed, that many of the player made levels are equal to, if not better than the current story levels. These levels, in my opinion are what is causeing this game to live and thrive within its own community.Now, I will admit the game has its small bugs, I have encountered latency issues when racing others, the game only has one achievment, and the UI could be improved some. But I'm not worried about these things not getting fixed, because after playing this game for so long, I can see that this is a soul project. That these developers arn't just making this game to make some cash, they  CARE , and they  LISTEN [i/]. It may take time to get these things updated but I have no doubt that they won't fix these problems.If you want a awesome racing game, buy Distance, and SPREAD THE WORD. I only heard of this game 6 years ago, and that was from some youtubers, only within the last year did I hear about it again and also have the cash to buy it!I promise, you will not be dissapointed in this purchase.Have fun racing folks!

The concepts of thrusters on the top of your vehicle to push it down to in a way grab on to new surfaces is facinating, there are parts of the track that lead you to doing this but with this your car can leave the road and wall ride or even ride some surrounding environment terran.

								It is spherical vacuum arcade racing game. With style. Simple, yet facinating futuristic neon-style graphics combines perfectly with modern EDM music and all the game visuals extraordinary well conveys the sense of speed. Strict lines and bright colors make unique mood for every race track: aggressive, calming, refreshing etc. and yet unobtrusive. With cool style comes great gameplay. Old good ""simple to learn but hard to master"". Familiar to all arcade race being enriched with advanced 3D maneuvering provide unique experience. It's hell of a fun when you can jump off track at full speed into small gap between buildings performing a barrel roll and then sucsessfully land. Every time it's like ""HELL YEAH!!!"". And when it comes to leaderboards great challenge occurs. It's suddenly becomes ""not that simple"" and to enter at least top 100 you will need a good sence of timing, reaction and spatial thinking.And as bonus with every patch devs manage to polish the game and make it even better. Can't wait till final release and will definitely race with style again. 10/10.			"

This is a game that I can easily keep putting more hours into since there's a pretty much non-stop stream of new surprisingly high quality courses to run through made by the community. The ""beta"" tag really only refers to the shorter single player mode, as the rest of the game is incredibly well polished and plays amazingly. There are a few downsides: If you want to be good, this game is HARD. But there's also a lot of fun gameplay to master. You start by becoming good at avoiding obstacles, then you get good at using your thrusters to rotate your car in a pinch, and finally you can learn more advanced techniques like using your boost to direct your movement in the air and using your thrusters while on the ground to make quicker turns and stick to walls and such. Even beyond that is far more advanced techniques, but those are really only used if you want to do shortcuts, not really for just going through a difficult course normally. However, if you're not confident in your gaming skills, you can always stick to the easier courses, just be aware that most servers tend to run courses that are on the more difficult end of the spectrum. If that's the case, just find some easier courses in the workshop and set up your own server, there are plenty of beginner players out there that will gladly join you for some races. The servers oftentimes are pretty few, especially in the off hours. I usually find myself starting up a server most of the time, but after a couple of races I'll usually have gathered 5 other people to fill the server. In the really dead hours though, you're lucky to find even 3 people online to join your server (however to be fair, most people aren't going to play this game at 3am EST). There are some bad courses. For every amazing course, there are 3 horrendous ones to take its place. On the bright side, people rarely choose these courses when they're running their servers, so most of the time you only race on the truly exceptional courses (if you open your own server every time, you can of course control it so that you ONLY race on the good courses, but you don't discover any new content that way aside from browsing the workshop previously). What's cool though is that once you race on a course from another server, it's added to your library. If you don't like it, you can rate it negatively and delete it later, but if you do like it it's great because you can just keep it and play it later without any extra steps!Finally, I know that most people won't do this, but playing this game in the first person has been AMAZING. It can make it more difficult to do corkscrews and flips and such (although in some cases it actually makes some tricks easier), but once you adapt to it it truly becomes an incredibly immersive and engaging experience that I could easily recommend to everybody.

								I would like to give out an honest but quick review of the game, even though it's still in the beta.Pros- Visually stunning- Great Adventure Mode (so far)- Workshop wonderland- Pumpin' music- Good connection on some of the servers- Car color selection options are limitless- Not bad for a betaCons- Some areas on the car and the world need more shading and better lighting angles- Multiplayer: Warping to the next track while others are not finished with the current one- Camera angles get weird when hitting a sawblade or grinder- Far as I know, isn't game controller supported- Jump button sometimes not registering when pressedOverall score: 8.9/10Definitely not your average racing game, that's for sure.

								This game is brilliant:-A very large and acomplished Workshop Community, consistantly producing maps with great gameplay, challenge and visual bombardment.-Unfortunately, this game doesnt get the reception/publicity it deserves in my opinion. Its like Mario Kart + Audio Surf + Wipeout. The epic music is timed perfectly with visual beats and map choreography. The gameplay is smooth and allows endless combos and excitement. Funny when playing with noobs, intense and exciting when playing with semi-pros.-This game is one which is great to play either by urself (because your so enthralled by the bright collours and effects) -- Or with others, due to the awesome competition and skill required to race round the maps.-Would definately recommend, but have practice; dont just give up if u cant work out at first. I did, then came back a few months latert, completed the campaign and have had loads of fun since. "

								Aside from the unfinished adventure mode, this game is looking fantastic. The mechanics are pretty much completely solid for a modern and physics-driven, yet arcade-y car game, a lot like Rush. Especially Rush 2049. You guys remember that, right? Well, that's immediately what the wings reminded me of, although you have a Spy Hunter-esque turbo which doubles as a jet engine in Wing mode.The other amzing thing was the procedural damage to your vehicle's model.I don't know if it's really being torn in half or if it's just for looks, and the whole model is still there, but the fact it even knows what part of the car to disapear is still fantastic. You also regenerate less serious damage like having a laser graze the side or top of your car. And even if you take serious damage, you can still go for a regen checkpoint. I've survived with like a third of a car left. IDK how, but okay. Typically crashing will kill you faster than lasers, but it they do destroy your ability to move, and then you'll probably crash into something, like a grinder.EDIT: Lasers generate heat and can kill you with that. Also, Torcht (composer and dev) demonstrated that you can survive with a sliver of your car left as long as its got wheels.I also like the mix of predictability and unpredictablity of various hazards, including non-static hazards that follow you before deploying. Protip: you can cheese them by slowing down.The campaign pulls off proper progression of both difficulty and music in spades. The first time you encounter the anomaly  it comes all sudden, the music is ♥♥♥♥in creepy, and there's not much change in diffiuclty but still leaves you like ""OHHHH♥♥♥♥♥♥"" but then when you encounter it again, the music is more rhythmic, like ""I've dealt with this before come at me, scrub,"" while the maps are much harder.And the ending you get because the adventure mode is incomplete was incredible. I've never seen anything like it, and mostly because at first I thought it was actually part of the game, and something crazy was about to go down. Hopefully this same, crazy bug-out becomes a part of the story at some point, a lot like how the anomalies work.btw, what the ♥♥♥♥ was that detour? That was a wild experience.Silence. No gravity. No heat buildup. Bruh.I would love to see more of these mind♥♥♥♥eries in the campaign, and be a part of the story somehow as well.If you need any pointers, I'm sure Ransom Arceihn would know what to do.No, I'm not even going to comment on the graphics because they speak for themselves, although I will say it's fantastically optimized, and I get ~60 frames running FXAA3, medium reflection, full anastropic, and medium shadows, all on an old, 2010 video card from when DX11 was first supported. Oh, and my motherboard is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and has bad timings (constant RAM addressing errors). Really need to get a new one. The only other game that can hold it's own despite that is Star Conflict.			"

								Kickstarted this game, but havent written a review until now. The game is a total blast, its everything i hoped it to be.. And the Vive support is awesome.. the editor is very powerfull, the traps varied, the rush while driving... Either the game gets harder in VR or my skills have faded since i played this alot... The levels i made my own is really hard in VR, and doesnt feel to me as much as awesome F-zero like levels like i thought when playing on a regular monitor... i guess i have to make some  levels custom made for VR when i get the time to stop all the other experimentation with Vive... If you own a vive, or a computer, or something similar to a computer.. get this game. highly recommended.			"

								To start off, I'd like to point out that I do not like most racing games, and I'd also like to point out that Distance is not most racing games. Distance puts you in control of a vehicle that can fly with wings, has jets on all sides, can wall ride, jump, flip, and do anything in between. The controls feel fantastic, the music is amazing, the enviorments are immersive, huge and explorable. There is an adventure mode that acts like the tutorial and tells the story of the game (which is actually quite good, especially when you realize it's being told through a race track), however the real fun begins when you enter the challenge maps of the game. The developers respect player skill and are not afraid to give you a real challenge. Add in community levels and steam workshop, and you'll have replayability and new maps forever. I can't love this game enough, if you feel on the edge about it, I'd highly reccomend trying out Nitronic Rush. It is free and it is the predecessor to Distance. It functions relatively the same as Distance, and will give you a feel for what you can expect from Distance. However, keep in mind that Distance is much more polished, detailed and has a lot of improvements.			"

								Normally I don't play racing games. It's not that I don't like them, I just find that there's not enough content. Now, I have no idea what Nitronic Rush had... Perhaps the colorscheme, or the feel of actual speed, or more likely the insane gravity defying mechanics ...but somehow I absolutely loved it. Naturally as the predecessor of that game, I'd expect just as much from Distance, And they delivered. not only is there a stronger sense of speed, they also enhanced the engine, allowing for some crazy gravity-defying roads and unique obstacles that launch you, explode you or just plain cut you in half and let you struggle to the next checkpoint. Now I'm not saying the game is perfect, there are a few tiny things that bug me. First of all, the colors don't seem as extravegant and intense as I remember them in the first game, also it get's anoying randomly exploding because you are riding along the wall to just barely pass by a sawblade. But as a fan of Nitronic Rush, I can't help but love Distance as well. 9.5/10			"

Although I wanna say to the devs that the campaign was the best part for me, you guys really have somethng there. I love how relaxed it was then how it slowly built up to frantic chaos. You should pour everything into that adventure, make it so much more, a lengthy story, a drop of fear, and an epic soundtrack - which you guys should release when the game is complete.			"

								Ok so I began to get excited about this game long ago when development was first announced.  As one of the seemingly few Racing genre fans left out there, this was high on my list for arcade style shenanigans.  When I saw it up for Early Access, I just had to try it for myself.  Firstly, let me start by saying I didn't know it, but I've been waiting my whole life for this game.  The flying mechanic is awesome and it brings a totally unique spin on survival racing genre.  The look is fitting, the soundtrack rocks, and the graphics are modest but sweet.  If you enjoyed Extreme G on the N64 or any of the F-Zero games, or games like them, you should enjoy Distance.  A big thing that's different though that I haven't seen often is what makes it a survival game.  There aren't weapons on vehicles or combat in any traditional sense.  Instead, your faced with a myriad of interesting obstacles to overcome.  Some of it is track memorization but there's plenty moving around and enough nuance that it's going to take on-the-fly skills to get a good time in this game.  Ok, so it's kind of a dream come true, but what's wrong with it?For fairness sake, I need to talk about what I think isn't so great about the game too.  For starters, I think the multiplayer is going to be a tough sell since people have to host their own servers.  That's hard to get people to do even for games where it's expected, like FPS games.  I hope a dedicated few make a nice online scene for the playerbase, otherwise we're gonna have a hard time playing together.  Secondly, there's still something to be desired in the handling.  They've got a really solid base for how the controls feel (I'm using a game pad), but there needs to be some more precision to it.  Everything feels just a little bit soft, so hopefully they can tighten those knobs.  Finally, there needs to be better programming to handle bumping into stuff.  If you full blown crash, you're out of the race, and that seems to work fine.  It's when you ram a wall, or awkwardly get turned upside down, or stuck in a corner, or land funny from flying, that you find yourself pressing buttons that don't help.  There needs to be more protocols for what happens when X fails.  This is of course beta, so stuff like that is already on the to-do list I'm sure, but that will help a lot with the replayability of levels and it will make failure less frustrating.  All in all, this game is a solid buy for any fan of the racing genre, particularly those older arcade style games that were focused on external stuff like survival rather than pure-racing.  I will be spending plenty of time in this title.  I think there's a lot of room for improvement but the game has a really solid foundation and so with proper support I'm excited to think we'll get an iconic title out of this one.  PS: I'd like to add that they really did a nice job with the mechanics and how they teach them to you.  They took all the advice I see directed towards newer developers (not saying these guys are new, I don't know the company's history) and they used it to their advantage.  The overheating system in juncture with the restoration circles is beautifully simple and very well tuned.  The story mode teaches you all the crazy things you have to avoid in a perfect way.  Very non-tutorialy while at the same time being an excellent tutorial.  - Nice job on the basic mechanics.			"

								This game is great. I can't say too much about it as I haven't played a lot, but from the time I have played, I've really enjoyed it. Here are some pros and cons to the game:Pros:  - The music is really nice. If you're into any sort of electronic music, the game has some decent songs in store. If you don't enjoy the songs the game provides, it's simple to choose your own songs from your computer - Good levels. The levels are fun, fast-paced and keep you on the ball constantly. It's easy to get caught up playing many different levels without realising where the time has gone - Fast-paced. This game is incredibly fast-paced. Every single second counts and misjudging a jump, a turn or an obstacle can be very problematic. This makes it very fun as the level of focus required is great. - The community. The community is constantly creating new levels and this provides all kinds of fun, with new designs constantly coming out - You can create your own levels. If you want a break from the action, you can create your own levels to submit to the steam workshop for you and other people to play. Cons: - The design capabilties of the cars isn't too expansive, but the design of the car doesn't really matter, but for those who like cosmetics, this may be somewhat annoyingOverall, this game is really good, and I'd recommend buying it in a sale as the price is a little much. But regardless, this game is fantastic, intriuging and fun to play always.9.5/10			"

It carries a lot of mechanics from NR and improving them at the same time, plus it adds a few things to the NR formula that I'll let you discover. Accompanied by a great soudtrack from the guys for the previous game,. you'll have a great experience with this game!The game has a lot of eye candy, which can be a bad thing for some levels, reaching 45 FPS on the worst of days, for a game that should be smooth, it does breaks the experience a bit. But if your computer's up the the task, go ahead :D....Oh... and there's a level editor and multiplayer inside... if you're into that kind of stuff :3.			"

								This is a good game with an incredibly big potential to become something great. The only downside I've found with this game is that the main 'Campaign' or what ever you would choose to call it is very short (took me less than 2 hours to complete), but on the other side the devs have left it to the community to ensure that there's alot more enjoyable playtime through community made maps. The devs have thought outside of the box on this one, and the game is very satisfying to play in general, but I think it lacks just a little bit of speed. I can't help saying this, but I wish I could get a higher top speed at some points. Still -Music is great 10/10Layout is great 10/10Physics are great 10/10Map creator is great 10/10Buy the game, you won't regret it.			"

								So.  Distance.  Hmm.  How to describe it?If I were to summarise it in one sentence, it would be ""It's like Dark Souls and Tron had a baby, and the baby was a game which was allegedly a racing game but was actually an adventure game where you play a car in a post-apocalyptic cyberscape"".  Which is certainly an idiosyncratic description, so perhaps I'll go into more details.Graphically, it's gorgeous.  The art design is incredibly strong and the different areas of the city feel very distinctive - and the challenges you'll encounter vary based on sector.  The audio is likewise near pitch perfect.  The controls are tight, and the game always felt fair.  Yes, I died a lot in some sections, but it always felt like it was something I'd done wrong, rather than the game punishing me for bad luck.  That's high praise and speaks well of their design ethos.As it stands, the game is somewhat lacking in content.  I burned through Adventure mode in about an hour.  It was incredibly polished and I encountered no bugs - it's just not very long.  So if you're looking for a full game, hold off until it's out of Early Access.  However, once it's finished and if it lives up to the current high standards, I would freely recommend it.			"

								Trackmania on Acid This game is fast and can be punishing, but it is always fun.The short storymode, so called adventure, is a mix made of tutorial and training.You learn to drive and what you have expect from the game. The graphics are good, not the best but you have not much time to look around, and the Vehicle-""slicing"" is a nice gameplaytwist. The real heart of the game are the arcade mode and driving for the best medals on the tracks.Also the community made many levels for the game, which are all well designed and partly can be like Dark Souls on Wheels.  Entertaining for hours.Overall a good early access version of a game. Hope to see more coming.			"

( I'm more a fan of rock music, but this soundtrack put me to listen eletronic music for several days in a row )º Graphics - AMAAAAAAAAAAAZING!º Replay Factor  - I'l never stop playin, understand ya?Review: I started this game a few months ago on a friend's account and kept playing this for hours no matter what this game is awesome and I love the futuristic TRON like graphics, the car being beatifuly designed and an alive system wich BOOTS when you start a new game, like WHAAAAAT? Yes it boots his OS system, and YES you can see it booting and starting its engine, wich makes no noise, it has an awesome boost system and the HUD and everything you need is displayed on the car leaving that 65'' amazing sharp and bright screen of yours all to the game graphics, or whatever screen you guys have, my point is: I LOVE THIS GAME!The game is well presented, it has a good stability, minor issues wich is awesome because It's on beta yet, X360 controller support (I only have an X360 to test), level editor, online gaming, random track generator, you can choose your own music to play in game.OMG!

								This is shaping up to be a very fun little game. The art design and music are great so far, the city has a distinctly Tron-like aesthetic and the music in each stage really brings out the atmosphere. Despite having no story to speak of it's stages string together a visual narrative that not only keeps you from getting bored but brings out a modicum of emotion as well. The tracks are well composed, nothing is unfairly unforgiving and one is rarely left scratching his head while stuck somewhere wondering what he's supposed to do. All in all I'm excited to see the final product.My only major complaint is the controls, or rather the way the game introduces you to them. Early on if you are using an XBOX controller it instructs you to use A to boost and X to jump. And early on this is fine, later you also need to quickly use the right stick which proves difficult. What the game doesn't tell you is that you can also use the shoulder buttons for boost and jump freeing your right thumb to do the tricky bits. But relearning the controls half way through the main game is kind of annoying. (As the game is in development this may all change)			"

								I picked up this game expecting a successor of Nitronic Rush, but instead I got something more. This game has an amazing soundtrack, but that should be expected of any good racing game. The mechanics are fantastic, the driving is smooth, the physics and destructability of the car are impressive. The gameplay is pretty nice, its fast, fluid and clean. There is no written story (as far as I know) but the scenery and soundtrack tell it. Some parts it actually is kinda spooky, in other parts it is fast paced and upbeat. There was one point in the Adventure mode, that I literally was in awe, im sure you will be too once you experience it (no spoilers, sorry =P ).  I personally feel that this game is beautiful, less of just another game, more of a work of art. However, that is only my opinion, and you may feel differently. With everygame (especially early access ones) there is always room for improvement. I hope to see this game get somewhere.  9.5/10 Fast like Sanic, Impressive like the Booty ~Tofu			"

								This game is simply amazing, the mechanics introduced from the former game, nitronic rush, are vastly improved for all the better. Not to mention its only a beta thus far. the biggest change is the addition of regeneration mechanics, through the courses your car will be crushed, sliced, and mangled by the various obsticles track. Checkpoints are spaced out in sucesion that act as normal checkpoints, in adition to this they also repair your car, this is vital to the later stages. One of these instances dawned upon me when my car got cut in half virtically by a laser, not only did my car get damaged, my controls were also altered so that i would veer off the course if i was to hasty.Or getting cut horazontaly leaving you with no lateral control forcing you to adapt to survive. (or you could just restart, but thats no fun is it?)  No matter how badly you get cut you would only die if you chose to self destruct or fall off the course, and for that i greatly recommend this game to anyone looking for a high tension racer, or just a streight up innovative game.

Whether you're screaming down the track at near, possibly above supersonic speeds in a mad dash to get to the finish line faster than your opponents, executing dazzling and sometimes hypnotizing flips and spins to rack up points and make your peers jealous of your finesse, avoiding buzzsaws, lasers, walls that pop up almost faster than you can react, and a whole mess of other obstacles in place to keep you from your goal, or just taking in all of the atmosphere and laser light shows of this electronica-driven masterpiece, Distance doesn't fail to please on any fronts.  If you're a fan of balls-to-the-wall, high-speed action that demands your full attention and split-second reflexes, I very much implore you to check out this game, you will not be disappointed.			"

								May not be the racing game you've been looking for to put years of commitment into, but, at the same time, it is. Believe it when it says ""Survival Racing"". I can't wait to see more of this game. Great concept, amazing execution, loads of content thanks to the in game level creator, and plenty of overall content to keep you coming back somewhat consistently at the least. The best game I could compare it to would be San Francisco Rush 2049, Cruisin Exotica/USA, or even Hydro Thunder. It is absolutely amazing, even if you're not into racing games, this is one you could really sink time into.To play the game, all you need to do is play the tutorial and pay attention. To win, you need patience. There is no learning curve to this game; it is a cliff. You just have to throw yourself off the edge over and over again until you learn where the pull chord is, only to drift into lava or get grabbed by a passing airplanes turbine. Even so, it is fun in its own right. "

								If you came here to check the reviews to see if the game is worth it. You have your answer.Just scroll down and look at all these happy people.Over 90% of people have recommended this game.Why are you still looking at reviews.Why are you still thinking about it?Why are you on your computer when you could be outside enjoying nature?Oh, wait. I think I know the answer to that one. Because games like this are fun, and the outdoors isn't a NEON FUTURE CITY WITH FLYING MAGNET CARS. At least, not yet.While we wait for that time to come. Just play this. Oh? Don't wanna spend $20 yet? Still want to mull it over? Look up ""Nightronic Rush"" on the internet and play that. It's a game about a neon future city with flying magnet cars. Sounds familiar right? Because Distance is kind of a more polished ""Sequel"" of Nightronic Rush. Same guys, same concept, much more polished. Much prettier. Yes.Now, to be serious for a moment. If you like what you see. It feels as cool as you can probably imagine. It doesn't get dull.The only time it gets dull is when you start to memorize a track too well. So? Download a bunch on Steam Workshop. There's like 5 more tracks every week.Some of these tracks will suck and I still don't know how to get rid of those ones. But most of them are pretty good. Hopefully the devs add a way to manage tracks and make playlists of tracks.That being my only gripe about this. Download it. Enjoy it. And if you're playing on a gamepad? Assign boost and jump to your bumpers. Trust me.Have fun. "

								I've been fooled by quite a few games on Early Access and become quite hesitant to even purchase them anymore. But I have to say this is one of the few gems inside of this program. Distance is just plain addicting. I can just spend hours on end replaying the same levels (Or going through the library of community made tracks on the workshop! ) over and over again. The car itself is amazing allowing you to boost, jump, fly and rotate giving you many options for sick tricks that you can do. The teleporters I have to say is another one of my favorite things about this game, nothing is as  cool as doing a flip through a teleporter and dodging multiple blades and lazers before landing it or suddenly being taken to an area with Zero Gravity or where you're upside down. Did I mention that the car also lets you ride on walls and ceilings? This game is fast paced, and very awesome if you can stay up to speed and stick to your reactions as you dodge anything that blocks your path. It has multiplayer already in the game from the get go which works pretty well for an Early Access game so far. The game also lets you customize your car to a limited extent along with an easy, but deep level editor. Also if you were wondering, you can go first person as well! There's no interior just the front of the car but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's tough but cool as hell to drive in that view. Recommend this game to any of your friends if you own it, this needs a larger community to support it!tl;dr: Game is like hotwheels, and trackmania with it's own little twists (Teleporter, and the car.) Very fun, awesome tricks. If you've been hesitant on buying it, don't hold back.I'd give this game personally a 10/10. Can't really find anything I don't enjoy about it. It's one of those fun, addicting little games you find that you can't put down and keep coming back to. Going from highspeed races, to doing sick stunts with your friends, along with making a level or two if you have the creativity and time. This game has quite a bit of content and love put into it for only being out for just under two months. I can't wait to see where it goes.			"

								Distance is a wonderful racing game.  The second game by the developers following Nitronic Rush.  This game is amazing in so many ways.  From the high speeds you can reach, to the tricks and stunts you can perform and the different game modes.  There is an incredibly detailed and awesome level editor, while the TrackMania series has the title for level editors, this game definetely is up there, with the ability to change light and colour of track pieces and the amount of scenery objects that can be placed.  When I play this game, I am constantly being remminded of Trackmania and how the cars felt when climbing up steep ramps and walls.  This game takes it further by adding in a jump feature allowing for some awesome manoeuvring over gaps and jumping from wall to wall like a car ninja.  For an early access, this is definetely something amazing.  We can all expect that this wil continue to get better with each update.  This is a game I would easily reccommend if they liked the TrackMania series cause they would almost feel right at home.  While anyone who has a fancy would enjoy it, TrackMania players would probably start off better.			"

								Awesome game. Even uncomplete it is better then any other racing game ever. I played Nitronic rush when it was first put on the Digipen site and i wished for a multiplayer version. my wish was more then granted. Custom car colors. getting cut in half with lazers and barely driving. 6 player online multiplayer 2 player local splitscreen. a workshop for custom maps. user friendly editor. Best game 200/10			"

								Highly recommended. Maybe the best racing game on Linux. If you ever wanted to race with a futuristic car in a very futuristic world, this game is for you! Its racing with a twist, your car can perform various new functions such as jumping, wallriding and even flying! All this makes for very interesting race courses where the quickest way sometimes requires a lot of creativity. Something like extreme-G mixed with Trackmania.Graphics and sound are excellent, but my favourite part is the gameplay. The car really controls so well, it is even possible to play with the keyboard. Good control is important as the game requires lighting fast reactions.Note there are no AI oponents, hopefully this is something that will be added later. I had a lot of fun playing with random people through multiplayer though. The split screen option is also a very welcome addition and this can very easily be a fun game to play when having friends over. Just make sure to find an easy level pack first as most of the default levels take a lot of practice to master.			"

								Hi! I'm Andrew, a long time veteran from Nitronic Rush. I played it a ton when it first came out!! Loved it! I've also speedran it and enjoyed the heck out of it. The optimization in the tenths of a second on community and story levels in Nitronic Rush gives me a great satisfaction.Distance surprised me at first and the controls were slightly different, a little more clunkier. However I had a very positive transfer effect that I immediately noticed when I first started playing. I was also very accustomed to the controls, thruster boosting, and flying.Positives:- Incredible interaction with the developers, almost immediate and positive feedback. Bug reports are addressed very quickly.- Promotional events consistently every Saturday, tournaments occasionally- Updates are constant and positively improve the game each time. Features are added onto and changes make a lot of sense with development, user experience, and overall gameplay design.- Fun single, and online multiplayer experience.- Great solo experience that offers improving your times, finding skips, and optimization in movement of the car- Game modes are plentiful and offer a lot more gameplay time and hours into the game in addition to Adventure mode, community levels, and multiplayer racing.- Fast, quick reaction time, and game sense is awarded to avoid obstacles and finding faster ways to complete the track. This allows you to leave your opponents in the dust and gives you a slight advantage.Overall, I feel distance is a solid 9/10 for me at the moment even in its current state! :) The developers have already mentioned that they will be still improving and refining the game even after release. They also are working on completing Adventure Mode for next year in 2016 and getting the game out of Early Access. I've already recommended it to many friends and many of them enjoy the game for what it offers.			"

								A great game even when it is still not finished.-The soundtrack is great, it fits the theme and makes you want to try all over again the difficult tracks.-The driving model is great but could use some minor tweaking.-Great Visuals.-You can race against different players.-There isn't much in terms of storyline but it is not an RPG but a racing game, which it does really well.-It can get frustrating and tiresome. It is not a game that you can play for hours without a rest, since it requires focus, concetration and good reflex.-Many different tracks, for casuals and hardcore players alike, some of which can take countless attempt to complete them, even with terrible time like 15 minutes. -Trick system could have more usage during the race.If I have to give a score right now I think it deserves 8/10, great game but it may not suit everyone.

								Reminds me of wipeout but, there is no need for the cars to have weapons as the track is trying to kill you!! Freakin mental tracks not even tried the community ones yet but just did a burst on the adventure mode and boom just over an hr gone and i didn't even notice, sick game. will have a dabble in the track editor later which also looks incredible, with tons of options. only one thing could make this even better, car mods/different cars, maybe a garage of some kind to buy and use new parts on the cars. 9.9 out of 10 cos i almost threw my controller a few times lmao. If you think this is some casual racer you'd be wrong, lasers, giant circular saws, and huge floating spike barricades slamming into the track right in front of you with a millisecond to dodge, make this game badass with a side of how the♥♥♥♥♥♥am i still going with half my car sliced away :O. insane... :D			"

								Aside from the unfinished adventure mode, this game is looking fantastic. The mechanics are pretty much completely solid for a modern and physics-driven, yet arcade-y car game, a lot like Rush. Especially Rush 2049. You guys remember that, right? Well, that's immediately what the wings reminded me of, although you have a Spy Hunter-esque turbo which doubles as a jet engine in Wing mode.The other amzing thing was the procedural damage to your vehicle's model.I don't know if it's really being torn in half or if it's just for looks, and the whole model is still there, but the fact it even knows what part of the car to disapear is still fantastic. You also regenerate less serious damage like having a laser graze the side or top of your car. And even if you take serious damage, you can still go for a regen checkpoint. I've survived with like a third of a car left. IDK how, but okay. Typically crashing will kill you faster than lasers, but it they do destroy your ability to move, and then you'll probably crash into something, like a grinder.EDIT: Lasers generate heat and can kill you with that. Also, Torcht (composer and dev) demonstrated that you can survive with a sliver of your car left as long as its got wheels.I also like the mix of predictability and unpredictablity of various hazards, including non-static hazards that follow you before deploying. Protip: you can cheese them by slowing down.The campaign pulls off proper progression of both difficulty and music in spades. The first time you encounter the anomaly  it comes all sudden, the music is ♥♥♥♥in creepy, and there's not much change in diffiuclty but still leaves you like ""OHHHH♥♥♥♥♥♥"" but then when you encounter it again, the music is more rhythmic, like ""I've dealt with this before come at me, scrub,"" while the maps are much harder.And the ending you get because the adventure mode is incomplete was incredible. I've never seen anything like it, and mostly because at first I thought it was actually part of the game, and something crazy was about to go down. Hopefully this same, crazy bug-out becomes a part of the story at some point, a lot like how the anomalies work.btw, what the ♥♥♥♥ was that detour? That was a wild experience.Silence. No gravity. No heat buildup. Bruh.I would love to see more of these mind♥♥♥♥eries in the campaign, and be a part of the story somehow as well.If you need any pointers, I'm sure Ransom Arceihn would know what to do.No, I'm not even going to comment on the graphics because they speak for themselves, although I will say it's fantastically optimized, and I get ~60 frames running FXAA3, medium reflection, full anastropic, and medium shadows, all on an old, 2010 video card from when DX11 was first supported. Oh, and my motherboard is a♥♥♥♥♥♥and has bad timings (constant RAM addressing errors). Really need to get a new one. The only other game that can hold it's own despite that is Star Conflict.			"

Its like Mario Kart + Audio Surf + Wipeout. The epic music is timed perfectly with visual beats and map choreography. The gameplay is smooth and allows endless combos and excitement. Funny when playing with noobs, intense and exciting when playing with semi-pros.-This game is one which is great to play either by urself (because your so enthralled by the bright collours and effects) -- Or with others, due to the awesome competition and skill required to race round the maps.-Would definately recommend, but have practice; dont just give up if u cant work out at first. I did, then came back a few months latert, completed the campaign and have had loads of fun since. "

								I love driving 1/10th of my car. Best futuristic car ever.Seriously though, I love everyone who made this game so much, dude. They're geniuses. This game is frustrating and at the same time I can't get enough of it! It's so perfectly atmospheric. It's like Audiosurf had a baby with Mario Kart. It's so good. The developers seem so nice, too! Especially from the credits section. I have deep respect for them! I can't wait to see what's next.			"

								Distance is incredibly satisfying. It feels like Wipeout 2048, Burnout, and Trackmania had a strange love child. Yet somehow, Distance manages to be something all it's own.If you're a fan of over the top racing games or the arcade racers of the early 2000's, you'll absolutely love this game. The levels created by the developer are well thought out and look incredible, and the large number of fan made levels are quality from what I've played thus far. Refract does a great job integrating fan made levels into the different online and offline modes. Distance nails that neo techno vibe that looks equal parts Tron and Amplitude. The levels also pulse along with the music, which is a nice touch.There is something viscerally satisfying about the controls. A huge component of Distance is mastering how to ""jump"" from one piece of track to the next. Tilting the car, and learning how to work the controls is a fun uphill battle. I've played many games in this genre, and none of them handle the way Distance does. There is also the way the car starts to fall apart in between checkpoints. The sense of speed gives me flashbacks of F Zero, but the arcade style controls are much more remeniscent of Trackmania and Wipeout.If there was one criticism to be had for Distance's controls, it's that the drifting mechanic doesn't feel right. You don't really need to drift because of how the game works, but my brain is so programmed to from years of playing racing games. It feels like the game registers any attempt to drift at any speed as the same thing, which is a little frustrating. Also, I think Distance would really benefit from a ""bump left"" and ""bump right"" function. The game feels a lot like Wipeout to me, and without the ability to double tap to move out of the way of an obstacle, something just feels a little off.This is all nitpicking though. Distance is a phenomanal game. If you love time attack or arcade racers, I highly recommend picking this up. It's the best early access game I've ever played, and probably the best racer to ever come out of early access. This game will only get better over time. Better to pick it up now than when it's $40 or $60 in a year. It's worth every penny.			"

								This game is fun as ♥♥♥♥. I like to blast a bunch of electronic, speed metal, or J-pop (don't judge me) and play this drunk for hours. Very futuristic and cool looking tracks, pretty good car handling, abundance of community tracks, and nice graphics. If this were to come out on consoles back when X1 or Ps4 first came out it would have easily been the #1 racing game imo.			"

								This game is great. I can't say too much about it as I haven't played a lot, but from the time I have played, I've really enjoyed it. Here are some pros and cons to the game:Pros:  - The music is really nice. If you're into any sort of electronic music, the game has some decent songs in store. If you don't enjoy the songs the game provides, it's simple to choose your own songs from your computer - Good levels. The levels are fun, fast-paced and keep you on the ball constantly. It's easy to get caught up playing many different levels without realising where the time has gone - Fast-paced. This game is incredibly fast-paced. Every single second counts and misjudging a jump, a turn or an obstacle can be very problematic. This makes it very fun as the level of focus required is great. - The community. The community is constantly creating new levels and this provides all kinds of fun, with new designs constantly coming out - You can create your own levels. If you want a break from the action, you can create your own levels to submit to the steam workshop for you and other people to play. Cons: - The design capabilties of the cars isn't too expansive, but the design of the car doesn't really matter, but for those who like cosmetics, this may be somewhat annoyingOverall, this game is really good, and I'd recommend buying it in a sale as the price is a little much. But regardless, this game is fantastic, intriuging and fun to play always.9.5/10			"

								This is the racing game my brother and I have been searching for for weeks. It's fast-paced, with obstacles that aren't punishing but are rewarding to get past. It's got flight (if you've played Krautscape, it's like that) for when you fly off the edge, and boosters for that real high speed feel. It's kind of like rocket league in terms of handling, but without the bounciness...or the ball (unless you're playing Soccer mode!). All in all, I'm really glad I spent $20 on this. It's gorgeous too! Putting this on ultra everything was great.			"

								I have to give out my review to this, I hope Refract will read this.I played the earlier version of this game, Nitronic Rush, and seeing how much they've improved I had to by this version and support it. For a game in progress - It was absolutely worth it.I had so much fun sitting hours and hours, playing community levels, playing on online servers, just flying around in my car, doing very fast sprint levels with style and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of every level. This is the core of this game and it was very succesful, and I believe this is going to be a great game. Besides... this one thing.Playing all of those community made levels really made me want to make one of my own. The level editor is probably the most confusing editor I've seen in a while, even after the tutorial it took me a lot of time to position things correctly - like checkpoints or particles. Sometimes they don't spawn where you put the cursor if you build too high, other times it just takes years to position them right. Just like the teleporters - it took me ages to understand how they work, and how to position them right.Refract studios, you have an incredible game and an amazing idea, but you have to help us keep expanding it. There must be ways where we could make this editor more simple and more explanatory (If that's even a word) . I'm up for giving any suggestion you may need.Thank you for making such an awesome game.			"

								May not be the racing game you've been looking for to put years of commitment into, but, at the same time, it is. Believe it when it says ""Survival Racing"". I can't wait to see more of this game. Great concept, amazing execution, loads of content thanks to the in game level creator, and plenty of overall content to keep you coming back somewhat consistently at the least. The best game I could compare it to would be San Francisco Rush 2049, Cruisin Exotica/USA, or even Hydro Thunder. It is absolutely amazing, even if you're not into racing games, this is one you could really sink time into.To play the game, all you need to do is play the tutorial and pay attention. To win, you need patience. There is no learning curve to this game; it is a cliff. You just have to throw yourself off the edge over and over again until you learn where the pull chord is, only to drift into lava or get grabbed by a passing airplanes turbine. Even so, it is fun in its own right. "

								Distance is a wonderful racing game.  The second game by the developers following Nitronic Rush.  This game is amazing in so many ways.  From the high speeds you can reach, to the tricks and stunts you can perform and the different game modes.  There is an incredibly detailed and awesome level editor, while the TrackMania series has the title for level editors, this game definetely is up there, with the ability to change light and colour of track pieces and the amount of scenery objects that can be placed.  When I play this game, I am constantly being remminded of Trackmania and how the cars felt when climbing up steep ramps and walls.  This game takes it further by adding in a jump feature allowing for some awesome manoeuvring over gaps and jumping from wall to wall like a car ninja.  For an early access, this is definetely something amazing.  We can all expect that this wil continue to get better with each update.  This is a game I would easily reccommend if they liked the TrackMania series cause they would almost feel right at home.  While anyone who has a fancy would enjoy it, TrackMania players would probably start off better.			"

								I don't know what else to say about this game other than that so far it's the only racing game on Linux that I've played that is fun. It's very much an arcade style racer with lots of unique mechanics like being able to drive on walls, jump your car with the press of a button, and there are things like spinning blades in the track you need to avoid.Update: So I played through as much is done so far in the campaign mode and feel like I got my money's worth already! I can't wait to play whatever else these devs have to offer!			"

I would not only recommend this game for others, but I'd even gift it to people I'd want to play with!That being said.. It's very ""arcade-y"", so don't expect and ultra realaistic or open world racing game.			"

								If you came here to check the reviews to see if the game is worth it. You have your answer.Just scroll down and look at all these happy people.Over 90% of people have recommended this game.Why are you still looking at reviews.Why are you still thinking about it?Why are you on your computer when you could be outside enjoying nature?Oh, wait. I think I know the answer to that one. Because games like this are fun, and the outdoors isn't a NEON FUTURE CITY WITH FLYING MAGNET CARS. At least, not yet.While we wait for that time to come. Just play this. Oh? Don't wanna spend $20 yet? Still want to mull it over? Look up ""Nightronic Rush"" on the internet and play that. It's a game about a neon future city with flying magnet cars. Sounds familiar right? Because Distance is kind of a more polished ""Sequel"" of Nightronic Rush. Same guys, same concept, much more polished. Much prettier. Yes.Now, to be serious for a moment. If you like what you see. It feels as cool as you can probably imagine. It doesn't get dull.The only time it gets dull is when you start to memorize a track too well. So? Download a bunch on Steam Workshop. There's like 5 more tracks every week.Some of these tracks will suck and I still don't know how to get rid of those ones. But most of them are pretty good. Hopefully the devs add a way to manage tracks and make playlists of tracks.That being my only gripe about this. Download it. Enjoy it. And if you're playing on a gamepad? Assign boost and jump to your bumpers. Trust me.Have fun. "

								Distance is a fast-paced survival racing game.Yeah, I know that description is bad, but I really don't know how to accurately describe it. Once you start playing, it will just suck you in and all you will focus on is cutting down on your personal best, slowly climbing up the leaderboards. Videos just cannot accurately transmit how fun Distance is, it's a game you'll have to play to understand.It's got good music, fantastically responsive controls, the art style looks amazing.. It's just a great game. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys high speed racing games.			"

								I loved the previous game by this team, Nitronic Rush. But there was something I didn't like about it: Nitronic Rush had a lot of side content that got very, very difficult. Thankfully, it was pushed off to the side, in a place where only the the craziest players could challenge themselves. You could play Nitronic Rush's campaign and face some tough-but-fair levels in crazy, beautiful neon cyber future environments.Distance doesn't give you that option. It bills itself as a ""racing survival"" game, so by the time you reach about halfway through what currently exists in its singleplayer, Distance's ""Adventure"" mode starts dishing out masochistic levels that delight on taking away your fun abilities and (sometimes literally) putting your car through a meat grinder. The game frequently teaches you how to do something, and while demonstrating how to use it, you're expected to learn something brand new before you're comfortable with the previous ability. It's frustrating and a little overwhelming. It's everything I didn't like about Nitronic Rush's extended content. I'm still recommending it, however. It's still more of what I wanted, and when the game isn't being unrelentingly masochistic, it's still terrific fun (particularly if you dive in to the Steam Workshop for a better selection of tracks). The only thing I miss is Nitronic Rush's sense of humor -- Distance is a bit more self-serious, which is a minor bummer.			"

Only part the sucks is that it doesnt get alot of traffic as far as online goes but its pretty good on like a friday night or if you have some friends to play with i guess that doesnt really matter.it also has community made maps which you can decide if thats good or bad thing (great in my books)			"

								Really fun, good artstyle (reminds me of TRON), good music. Has a sort of ""WipEout"" vibe to it. It'll be interesting to see where this game goes when more is added to it, but as early access/beta/whatever games go, this is a solid one.Only slight annoyances are the flying controls and the WASD booster things, they just feel a bit wonky (you have to operate and think about too many things at once, also the camera points itself in unhelpful directions while this is happening) and interrupt the smooth speed of the ground segments.The Steam workshop functionality is well-integrated, meaning it's easy to play new community-created maps all the time, and even create your own. There's also online multiplayer which is pretty fun.EDIT: It seems as though the most popular online maps are ""parkour"" ones which involve awkward mid-air maneuvering and tricky jumps, as opposed to speedy racing. I can't say I like these parkour tracks very much - they usually involve repeatedly failing a certain segment before moving on to the next one and repeating that process until the end, but even so, the online is still fun, and the community maps can be quite creative.Overall if you like racing games, futuristic stuff and DnB, this is probably a game for you.

								fun mix of arcade racer with a bit of twitch gaming mixed in, where you have to avoid road hazards by dodging or jumping over them.  Not your usual hazards either - in the base maps you'll be attacked by giant sawblades, laser beams - some of which move and platforms to jump onto.  All in all it gets your adrenaline flying and it's a great achievement to finish a map.   Includes a ton of user-created maps already with more to come or you can create your own.One of the best Early Access titles I've seen at launch.  Game is 100% playable and great already.  Mix that with an excellent developer team and a legion of fans, and you know this game is going to be solid!			"

								""Wake me when the online connectivity improves."" The story of an Australian and his American friend.Kidding. While I would like to write out a short story on that, it's just a case of this game still being early in development. What's there is already great, and you're buying what's advertised. Flashy neon graphics that make me feel like I'm playing a GOOD Tron game, if one ever existed. A snappy electronic soundtrack to go with it. Gameplay that needs reflexes just as quick as the car you're driving (exaggerating just a bit, it's actually very forgiving but you'll need to be good with your reactions, because once or twice the game throws an obstacle in your face like a friend tossing a basketball at your face and shouting 'think fast'.)All in all, fun, but STILL IN PROGRESS. The single player is short, but we are told this is because it is incomplete, simple as that. Even then, the developers tell us that they want the campaign to be short, so if there's not meant to be much more beyond that, then likely the game will focus on user generated content (rather interesting level editor and steam workshop support! The editor may be difficult to grasp, not out of difficulty, but out of the sheer amount of options) AND its online mode.Which leads me to the next thing to talk about. Upon selecting the online arcade, the game tests your network capability. Both me and my American friend were told our networks weren't too great (limited connectivity to NAT servers), and his works eith every game imaginable. Clearing up a few ports to host a server is one thing, but being unable to connect to any server at all is another. If we knew which ports or remedies would solve the Network Capability test, then we'd be having a blast. Until then, we can't connect to any servers whatsoever. So beware of this if you're buying the game with a focus on its online.Until it gets fixed, I'll have to shelf this for now. Great game! Can't wait until it improves.			"

The adventure mode is very short, depending on your skill level. The game realy shines in multiplayer and its steam workshop support. Split-screen multiplayer is a blast when playing reverse tag. The game's user created levels are also fun to blast through. Also, I feel I should give some mention to the credits stage, which is a giant level that has all of the people that worked on it and even some backers I believe. Really nice touch in my opinion.

								Racing games usually aren't my thing, but Distance does to racing what a mescaline overdose does to an adolescent polar bear.It's one of the trippiest cyber-punk dystopia racing games i've ever seen, with an awesome soundtrack to boot!The game runs quite nicely, and that's usually because the game does not have an over-abundance of clutter, just buildings and racing hazards.There are several different gamemodes to choose from, but my favorite is sprint, where you have to finish the track as fast as you can.The game will send you into spirals, climbing up walls, and flying. Yes, flying, not the kind of flying where you are in the air for a period of time and then land but....wait that is flying, anyways, your car doors turn into ""wings"" and you go ""whoosh!""And yes, you can race against other people.Keep in mind that it is still in early access, and the adventure mode is still not complete, so there are still some tracks that have not yet been released by the devs.But if you're itching for more tracks, don't fret, because this game comes with a very detailed map maker!Already the steam workshop has tons of player-made maps that you can play on-- most of them quite good.So rev up your engines and get ready to go the Distance!

This game is made by the same students that made Nitronic Rush at Digipen Institute of Technology, I got the original Nitronic Rush off of the Digipen website after a student visited my school a few years ago, and I LOVED IT. Now that the students have made their own studio - Refract - they have made a more, polished version of the old game. Playing this game always gives a a rush of adrenaline, and a smile on my face, and with multiplayer, and worshop racetracks, what's not to love?!P.S. - One of the BEST Early Acess Steam games EVER.

Early Access Review
								So a note before this review, at points I'm going to reference ""Nitronic Rush"" which is the previous game that the devs created and it's pretty much an alpha of this game.  (Even though I call it an alpha, it was well enough to be one of my favorite games) Let's begin (TL;DR version at end)Graphics: -In general: The graphics are very nice. And the options on the graphics are very nice as well, letting you customize them to a good extent which should make this playable on most machines.  -In game: The levels have very contrasting colors and a good variety of them in levels making it fun to see what's next.  The timer, speed, and boost gauge are on the vehicle, which works even though it might seem like it wouldn't.  I have not tried out the custom music option yet, which is supposed to change the graphics even more in time with your music (which actually sounds really cool).Performance:-For some reason and I don't know why, this game seems a little slow to me. I have put my graphics to a good spot, but it still seems just a bit slow. I am comparing to nitro in this case, and I'm not sure if it's because of a new engine or some other factor, might even just be me, but it does seem like it runs slightly slow with the graphics settings on par with nitro.( I have been informed that the future builds are going to be more stable, and that the slowness is due to added physics and sensitivity changes)The Gameplay:-This is a survival racer, not a standard racer. Most levels have you going through a level past numerous obstacles, lasers, and more to get to the goal. Compared to nitro rush I have to say that Distance really upped the gameplay. Lasers don't kill you now, instead they slice apart your car into a bunch of tiny pieces which is actually really fun to mess with. The flying is utilized a LOT more, in much more entertaining ways. Certain areas disable the wings so you can't cheat through them which utilizes more skill. Enemies do actually change depending on how you move (one actually stopped me for a whole minute because it kept tracking me). There was even a spot with zero gravity and I can't emphasize how much I actually enjoyed this area. It's something unique and I haven't seen something like that in a racing game before. I'd really like much more of that area in the game. The levels at times are confusing, and I got lost at at least one point.  All in all, just from playing the adventure mode, I can say that this is quite the improvement to Nitro.-The only thing I'd actually suggest for an improvement is having more wall riding and ceiling riding areas similar to hardcore mode from nitro. Those are a lot of fun to drive withControls:-Controls are pretty good, not as sensitive as I'd like standard, but overall good. I have learned you can customize the controls and fix them to however you like. (I would not overly reccomend customizing the controls, but it's more of a personal choice.)Level Editor:-This thing... this thing is... amazing. I haven't seen a more customizable level editor. It looks very much like a full 3D modeling program. I thought you could add custom models, but apparently the maps so far have been using the in-game items which is very nice. Here's an idea, someone make a drivable map on a heavy from TF2. Overall it is a little intimidating to newcomers, but it should be fun to use and it is very cool.All in all, I really enjoyed playing this game so far and it's not even fully released yet. Once it's fully released, the bugs should be fixed (there aren't that many bugs to begin with) and there should be some new features to play around with.I have learned there is a car color customizer in the options. I do highly reccomend this game, and it's not even fully released yet. I look forward to the full release of this game.Thanks to Californ1a for giving me some info to make the review better and clarifying some things I mispoke on.TL;DR: Flippy car game with lasers, booms, flying and more. 10/10 would race			"

								A very abstract-yet-addicting approach to merging both puzzle and driving genres into one new-age racing game.rundown:+ amazingly crisp graphics+ an easy-to-learn level workshop editor with plenty of tutorials+ A catchy futuristic electronic soundtrack+ no HUD to block your view (for this kind of game, all you really need is a speed gauge and elapsed time)+ Your car can freakin' fly/flip/rotate/glide!!!+ Nice visual damage detailing to your vehicle. (from small dents in your fender to being sliced in half by lasers)+ You can still continue driving, even with your car diced up in half, as long as you have more than half of your car is intact!- Car runs somewhat slow without boost and turns/flips over on a dime- Only one car for the whole game (although it could be a positive thing for people who dislike complicated racing games) - If you're a racing fan, why are you still reading this?

Early Access Review
								The more i play distance, the more i feel like it could be THE racing game to pick up. and for an early access title it sure as heck is more polished than other games that share space there.the gist of it is summed up by the trailer and the game's description: you drive a super cool tron car of sorts through various areas in an attempt to get from point a to point b as fast as possible, while trying not to get sliced, smashed, flung off, or nitronic crash into a wall. the latter is silly because you can also drive on walls and cielings, which counts as a stunt (more on that later). you can also fly, but later levels tend to flip flop between letting you fly and not letting you fly, and you can shave seconds off the flying areas if you know how to.and that isn't all. you can cool down your thrusters by doing stunts. don't ask how it works, just roll with it. the controls feel buttery smooth and responsive, though some community made levels will make you think otherwise at times. the music in the game is top notch and i'd gladly toss my cash at Refract or Torcht just to get it through steam.and while the adventure is short and sweet, the replayability comes from the workshop. seriously, go check it out. there's dozens of tracks waiting to be conquered, either alone or in competition with friends and strangers alike. there's  the Stunt mode for those who want to do flips and stuff, or if you want to put it to more use on the courses, Speed and Style is a mode about doing tricks to cut time off the clock. finally, for the ultimate in keepaway, look no further than Reverse Tag. that assumes there's folks hosting that mode, which is often rare. but when it is hosted, it's the perfect blend of sprint, stunt, and king of the hill, with the hill being a ball of sorts that you snag and take with you, but others can also easily snag off you by driving into the ball while you have it.and if you intend to play this on multiplayer, be sure to hop on Distance on Saturdays. correct me if i'm wrong but i think that's the day when folks go outta thier way to host games of Distance multiplayer.EDIT:Californ1a Sep 3, 2015 @ 8:16pm  Yup, every Saturday 2pm-4pm eastern time is our community multiplayer event: http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/discussions/0/528398719786414266/Pinning this comment to the review. speedy saturdays is a thing, okay?also, figured i'd update this with some developments.Distance now has a Grip button (think Sonic's stomp in later games, but clings to walls and cielings if your wheels are pointed toward them, and slower, and also acts as the increased handling button) and has toned down a certain bug that allowed huge level skipping to the point it could be outright unfun. the trick is still doable, but now it's not capable of skipping entire sections of track.but the biggest improvement is the editor, which is now capable of more things than ever before. you need only look at ""Uncanny Valley"" for a decent start. granted, it could do that stuff before, but it was limited back then.on a side note, community is active enough that if you DL a map or two via workshop every now and then, you could get a good amount of maps to race on.TL:DR: Distance is a racing game all about going fast, and surviving. loads of community content keep the game fresh enough to last a while, and devs are hard workers, keeping the progress going.EDIT: if you see this review by any chance and get the game, hop onto the discord channel.this also applies to anybody who already owns the game. it's the best way to keep on top of Speedy Saturdays and community events, as well as the community showing off tidbits of what they are working on with the game's editor.oh, and the main levels of the game look like they're going to get prettied up when the adventure mode gets updated content.RIP Broken Symetry, though.

								I've had a DK2 for over a year now, and have played just about every worthwhile VR game currently available.  Out of nowhere, Distance is suddenly my favourite VR experience.Not only is it a really unique game in itself, like a cross between Radial-G and Mirror's Edge, but it has a seriously sweet soundtrack (especially love the transition to spacey ambient when your craft enters the zero-G bits, the kick drum thumping back in as you hit gravity again).  It's also the perfect game for VR:  the cockpit provides a wide view not only ahead of you, but beneath you thanks to a glass window in the floor that you'll be using a lot more than you might think.  Like Radial-G, you'll also find yourself looking up through the glass above you to see where the track vertically twists and turns in three dimensions.Runs like a dream (a rare but essential thing for VR games), plays awesomely.  Adventure mode will have you laughing and screaming, and has an unexpected sense of terror similar to SUPERHOT's story mode.  If you have a DK2, this is a must buy.			"

It's kind of like rocket league in terms of handling, but without the bounciness...or the ball (unless you're playing Soccer mode!). All in all, I'm really glad I spent $20 on this.

								This Distance is a fast and intense action survival racing game, where you drive agens other unique players in advanced atmospheric worlds.Have you ever wanted to be in that Tron legacy world with laser, future and amazing cool music? Well, here is your chance to live it in a car and do alot of driving, jumping, spinning, flying, avoiding insane traps and tracks. The game has a unique design of it's own, where the Tron legacy atmospheric world makes your hearth beat faster. Overall controlls with either keyboard or controller is simple to use, where you get a decent movement of your car. The game allows you to spin, jump, fly and drive with a health bar that might overheat to destroy you. Every map or custom map through workshop has checkpoints that resets/cooling it down.The music is fantastic, and makes you play all day, unfortunately the game has not unlocked the rest of the singleplayer, since it's in progress. The singleplayer campagin on the other hand throws you straight to basic's and into a interesting world of escape.Here is a demo:

								I'd honestly say this is one of the most entertaining racing games I've ever played. There's definitely not many games that require you to jump from wall to wall at high speeds while avoiding traps like lasers and saws while listening to fitting music before you've even completed the tutorial. Also the visuals look awesome, but it's not so overdone that you can't figure out what's going on.It's one of those rare games where you can join a server, find one of the best players in the entire game, and still enjoy yourself.To get the most out of it you'll need to play the community levels, since there's not many official levels. It's not a problem though, since a lot of community levels are on par with the official ones, and some are even better (plus the files are usually less than 1mb, so having hundreds of levels downloaded barely takes up any space).Anyway, here's a quick summary:+Looks and feels awesome+Challenging but not frustrating+Music fits perfectly+Hundreds of quality community levels+Procedural track generation (very early stages so will get a lot better)+Doesn't get annoying if you keep failing+Gravity doesn't even matter as long as you're going fast enough+Improved enough from Nitronic Rush to justify buying-Still no AI/ghosts (they'll probably be coming soon, but offline is a little lonely currently)-Some of the dynamic obsticles can feel luck based, which gets annoying if you're going for a fast time-Possibly a little harder to get good at if you have no controller			"

								Ok, before you buy this game, go play Nitronic Rush. If you like that you will like this. Distance is a Tron-esqe racing game where you speed along floating roads and fly through obstacles at very high speeds.Gameplay-10/10The gameplay in Distance is absolutely flawless. The controls feel fluid and are very responsive, and I know that I am in control of my car at all times. The gameplay consists of driving along roads at high speeds while dodging obstacles like buzzsaws, lasers, walls, spinning cylinders of death spikes, and so on. While you usually just drive along roads, you also can fly. Everything about the driving and flying is great. There is also a boost system that reminds me of Excite Truck, which was my favorite racing game until I got Distance. Also, if you get cut by lasers, you can still drive with half of your car. That's probably my favorite thing in Distance.Story-N/AThe adventure mode isn't finished yet, so I can't really review it right now.Multiplayer-10/10I haven't encountered any lag in multiplayer yet. You have to get to the finish as fast as possible, trying to beat the other players. However, the other players appear as ghosts and cannot effect your vehicle, making the race into more of a synonomous time trial. Graphics-10/10The graphics remind me of Nitronic Rush, but have a glossy new feel that fits with the atmosphere very well. Overall-10/10For what it is, Distance is a fantastic game. Even though it is essentially a remake of Nitronic Rush, it does everything right. It runs well on lower spec PCs, you can play it on Mac and Linux as well as PC, there's a level editor with workshop support. Just keep in mind that it is a racing game.			"

								One of the best games to fill your Linux game colection, maybe one of the bests if you like arcade racing games.Expect some crazy experience:-Zero gravity zones, (lot of potential here)-Loops.-Jump to wall driving.-Obstacles- Fly trought lasers.-Drive with half car.-And the best, take all that to make your custom track.The cons:-Hard to start if you go straight forward to Arcade and Custom tracks, so do Adventure first.-Sometimes fly mode makes you get lost in the track. Also, on the other hand, makes some sections too easy.-Some crazy tracks from community lower the performance with old pc becose abuse of lasers, obstacles... (although there are some realy cool tracks that run very smoth).			"

								Gameplay-wise, the game is less about racing, more about finishing levels as fast as possible. There's a difference. The base levels are excellent, the learning curve is easy, and the community made levels range from terrible to amazing with the majority (in my opinion) being amazing. More often than not, you'll be driving through these levels and resetting the entire race from the beginning if you die once, as most high score badges involve perfect runs. Oddly enough, I found this game almost as relaxing as Euro Truck Simulator. Almost.Visually, this game is very appealing to me. Think Tron. There's an in-game option of adding your own playlist which literally involves just linking a folder on your C:/ drive so the game can access the path, which I think is priceless. The base story mode can be done in an hour, so if  you want to get the most out of this game, check out the community made levels and the soundtrack the level-makers provide. Aside from that, the sandbox level editor is confusing to me (as all level editors are, I'm just not of the right mind for them) but it seems easy enough for other people to make some really beautiful levels.Improvements? I think this game has an excellent concept and would love to see up to 4-person local co-op, but I can only dream of a day there were more mass local co-op in many other games. I think the online servers could be improved by establishing P2P servers instead of player hostings for the sake of consistency and ease of use. Last, I think there should be a lap-based mode for legitimate racing as it would draw a more competitive crowd to this game, would mitigate the severity of dying, and would further promote the use of the car tricks to get ahead of other players via boosting (because I get the feeling items, like in Kart racing games, will not be added at this stage of development).Come to think of it, if this game had a mode that functioned like a Mario Kart game for the sake of lap or single stretch racing, but kept the gameplay mechanics and visuals as-is, I'd♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants and proceed to buy a 4-pack.

								This is such a great game, that there are a lot of words to describe it. It has very good levels both in the workshop and built in, the challenge part gives challenging levels to those that find the levels too easy. All in all I really recommend this game, only problem I see is the 6 player online limit at least for the most part, I feel to combat this it should be up to 10-15 since there are some people that with the current would need 2 servers for everyone to play. However, since this is early access I look forward to seeing how the game changes hopefully it stays at the same level or goes to greater lengths.			"

								I haven't played an arcade racer this much fun since Burnout Revenge. It plays like a Tron version of Split Second and Burnout with some nice racing trance music to set the tone.You can change from 3rd to 1st person view, learn some great anti gravity tricks and design you own track to troll people and its got a decent community of players to play against.  Don't make your track impossible though, thats just not cricket. They should just call this finished already.Whom ever deleloped this has clearly moved on to bigger and greater things. Edit: I stand corrected the dev is updating it on a regular basis. Thanks @Californ1aI would not pay more that 20 for it at the end of the day. Its a fast paced racer that will appeal to similar people. If you don't enjoy arcade racers, don't bother.			"

								I loved the previous game by this team, Nitronic Rush. But there was something I didn't like about it: Nitronic Rush had a lot of side content that got very, very difficult. Thankfully, it was pushed off to the side, in a place where only the the craziest players could challenge themselves. You could play Nitronic Rush's campaign and face some tough-but-fair levels in crazy, beautiful neon cyber future environments.Distance doesn't give you that option. It bills itself as a ""racing survival"" game, so by the time you reach about halfway through what currently exists in its singleplayer, Distance's ""Adventure"" mode starts dishing out masochistic levels that delight on taking away your fun abilities and (sometimes literally) putting your car through a meat grinder. The game frequently teaches you how to do something, and while demonstrating how to use it, you're expected to learn something brand new before you're comfortable with the previous ability. It's frustrating and a little overwhelming. It's everything I didn't like about Nitronic Rush's extended content. I'm still recommending it, however. It's still more of what I wanted, and when the game isn't being unrelentingly masochistic, it's still terrific fun (particularly if you dive in to the Steam Workshop for a better selection of tracks). The only thing I miss is Nitronic Rush's sense of humor -- Distance is a bit more self-serious, which is a minor bummer.			"

All in all it gets your adrenaline flying and it's a great achievement to finish a map.   Includes a ton of user-created maps already with more to come or you can create your own.One of the best Early Access titles I've seen at launch.  Game is 100% playable and great already.

								""Wake me when the online connectivity improves."" The story of an Australian and his American friend.Kidding. While I would like to write out a short story on that, it's just a case of this game still being early in development. What's there is already great, and you're buying what's advertised. Flashy neon graphics that make me feel like I'm playing a GOOD Tron game, if one ever existed. A snappy electronic soundtrack to go with it. Gameplay that needs reflexes just as quick as the car you're driving (exaggerating just a bit, it's actually very forgiving but you'll need to be good with your reactions, because once or twice the game throws an obstacle in your face like a friend tossing a basketball at your face and shouting 'think fast'.)All in all, fun, but STILL IN PROGRESS. The single player is short, but we are told this is because it is incomplete, simple as that. Even then, the developers tell us that they want the campaign to be short, so if there's not meant to be much more beyond that, then likely the game will focus on user generated content (rather interesting level editor and steam workshop support! The editor may be difficult to grasp, not out of difficulty, but out of the sheer amount of options) AND its online mode.Which leads me to the next thing to talk about. Upon selecting the online arcade, the game tests your network capability. Both me and my American friend were told our networks weren't too great (limited connectivity to NAT servers), and his works eith every game imaginable. Clearing up a few ports to host a server is one thing, but being unable to connect to any server at all is another. If we knew which ports or remedies would solve the Network Capability test, then we'd be having a blast. Until then, we can't connect to any servers whatsoever. So beware of this if you're buying the game with a focus on its online.Until it gets fixed, I'll have to shelf this for now. Great game! Can't wait until it improves.			"

								This game really shines when the courses are putting you through the paces.  Driving at breakneck speeds as you jump from wall to wall, dodging obstacles and lasers as they appear in front of you, Distance is amasing.  The only bad part of the game (at present, dont know how it will change in the future) is the flying.  It lacks the speed and tension of the driving with few obstacles and no real precision required.  Put in some tight corridors and im sure thatll change, but for now its a bit lackluster.  These sections are, however, few and far between generally so they dont really hurt the game.Be warned, the keyboard controls are a bit nuts (ya, im the guy that trys to play driving games with a keyboard) with way too many inputs to mange.  Fortunately, this is easily solved with a controller (havent felt a difference that big since Dark Souls).EDIT: I think ive figured out why i like this game so much.  Its very much like what a 3d Sonic game should be, platforming and all.  good on you devs, good on you.			"

								Really fluid, solid, fun gameplay, with some awesome mechanics. One of the few games that has genuinely given me a sense of boylike wonder in quite some time. Perhaps adjustments could be made to gravity shifts as they do not feel seamless, but honestly if this is a design choice to make the player choose between speed or safety, it works quite well.Maybe User Interface could look sharper, but it does not take away from the fun of the game as a whole and it definitely does not make it a worse game.

								This arcade racer has beauty, control, stunts, and is gravity defying in all the right ways.  Highly recommended on sale for fans of arcade racing games or speedrunners. Other people should consider waiting to get it until closer to release unless they have friends to play this with. Adventure mode serves as a pretty good tutorial that covers all the major mechanics even though its still being developed. The meat of this game are the workshop and generative levels. Online mode is decent, but the other player cars are basically live ghosts, so don't expect car smashing here.			"

								Story: 5/10 - So far in this game, the story consists of single levels which individually teach you how to use your controls. These levels are fun, but there are few of them and they finish rather quickly which makes the game repetitive after they are complete.Graphics 9/10 - The graphics were really good with a Tron-esque style. Everything was styled beautifully and nothing much wrong to say about it.Gameplay 8/10 - Gameplay was good with nice controls, allowing the user to take car racing to the next level with flying abilities and giving you full control over how the car moves and turns.Sound 10/10 - The soundtrack for this game was amazing. These pieces of music were composed beautifully with a heavy electronic theme and I come back to the game time and time again to listen to the music. The sound effects were also great.Overall 32/40 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED			"

								10/10: The game is tagged with ""Great Soundtrack"" for obvious reasons. The psy-trance or goa influenced tracks together with the futuristic, sci-fi race tracks make this game unique.Controlling the car with all features like nozzles pushing it to the track or rotating to ride walls are challenging at the beginning. Still, it is worth learning and somehow non-frustrating.Even if it's ""Early Access"", it is playable with almost no bugs and worth a try.  You get exactly what the trailers and preview videos in steam store show you.			"

								Full disclosure: I backed this game on kickstarter.Distance is basically what you'd get if you put Tron, a racing game, and a rave into a blender that made games.You can drive on the walls, ceilings, and basically anything else. Your car can fly!The controls feel really tight, and even when your car is damaged the physics kind of make it less annoying - having your car sliced in half and driving half a car to the next checkpoint is fairly entertaining.The game is, however, a bit short at the moment. Once you know what you're doing the story mode doesn't take very long, and neither do the other modes. There are generated levels and workshop levels, though, and there's supposed to be a story mode update at some point.Pros:- Cool car mechanics- Lots of modes- Everything glows. You can turn up the glowing if there's not enough glowing.- Replayability, level editor, random level generator- Still updating long after the kickstarter!Cons:- Really short story mode / modes in general			"

Distance is one of those games that will make you wonder why you didn't have it sooner.Update: IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS AND THERE ARE JUST AS MANY SINGLE PLAYER MISSIONS NOW AS THERE WERE WHEN THE GAME FIRST LAUNCHED.But hey look at these player created maps we picked this week.

								I never write reviews but... When i was a kid, there was this browser racing game called need for madness. the game is about doing laps and coming in first. You can play in two ways: 1. race and come in first place or 2. destroy every other car. You have a damage bar and a power bar. the more power you have, the faster your car would go and the stronger it would be but it's constantly draining. so there's ramps all over the map and to fill it back up again you need to do tricks much like in distance. This game is like Need for madness and Audiosurf combined. You can also ♥♥♥♥ing fly around. As soon as  i saw the trailer i was hooked. This game has alot of potential. Talk about a blast from the past.			"

								The more i play distance, the more i feel like it could be THE racing game to pick up. and for an early access title it sure as heck is more polished than other games that share space there.the gist of it is summed up by the trailer and the game's description: you drive a super cool tron car of sorts through various areas in an attempt to get from point a to point b as fast as possible, while trying not to get sliced, smashed, flung off, or nitronic crash into a wall. the latter is silly because you can also drive on walls and cielings, which counts as a stunt (more on that later). you can also fly, but later levels tend to flip flop between letting you fly and not letting you fly, and you can shave seconds off the flying areas if you know how to.and that isn't all. you can cool down your thrusters by doing stunts. don't ask how it works, just roll with it. the controls feel buttery smooth and responsive, though some community made levels will make you think otherwise at times. the music in the game is top notch and i'd gladly toss my cash at Refract or Torcht just to get it through steam.and while the adventure is short and sweet, the replayability comes from the workshop. seriously, go check it out. there's dozens of tracks waiting to be conquered, either alone or in competition with friends and strangers alike. there's  the Stunt mode for those who want to do flips and stuff, or if you want to put it to more use on the courses, Speed and Style is a mode about doing tricks to cut time off the clock. finally, for the ultimate in keepaway, look no further than Reverse Tag. that assumes there's folks hosting that mode, which is often rare. but when it is hosted, it's the perfect blend of sprint, stunt, and king of the hill, with the hill being a ball of sorts that you snag and take with you, but others can also easily snag off you by driving into the ball while you have it.and if you intend to play this on multiplayer, be sure to hop on Distance on Saturdays. correct me if i'm wrong but i think that's the day when folks go outta thier way to host games of Distance multiplayer.EDIT:Californ1a Sep 3, 2015 @ 8:16pm  Yup, every Saturday 2pm-4pm eastern time is our community multiplayer event: http://steamcommunity.com/app/233610/discussions/0/528398719786414266/Pinning this comment to the review. speedy saturdays is a thing, okay?also, figured i'd update this with some developments.Distance now has a Grip button (think Sonic's stomp in later games, but clings to walls and cielings if your wheels are pointed toward them, and slower, and also acts as the increased handling button) and has toned down a certain bug that allowed huge level skipping to the point it could be outright unfun. the trick is still doable, but now it's not capable of skipping entire sections of track.but the biggest improvement is the editor, which is now capable of more things than ever before. you need only look at ""Uncanny Valley"" for a decent start. granted, it could do that stuff before, but it was limited back then.on a side note, community is active enough that if you DL a map or two via workshop every now and then, you could get a good amount of maps to race on.TL:DR: Distance is a racing game all about going fast, and surviving. loads of community content keep the game fresh enough to last a while, and devs are hard workers, keeping the progress going.EDIT: if you see this review by any chance and get the game, hop onto the discord channel.this also applies to anybody who already owns the game. it's the best way to keep on top of Speedy Saturdays and community events, as well as the community showing off tidbits of what they are working on with the game's editor.oh, and the main levels of the game look like they're going to get prettied up when the adventure mode gets updated content.RIP Broken Symetry, though.

								This Distance is a fast and intense action survival racing game, where you drive agens other unique players in advanced atmospheric worlds.Have you ever wanted to be in that Tron legacy world with laser, future and amazing cool music? Well, here is your chance to live it in a car and do alot of driving, jumping, spinning, flying, avoiding insane traps and tracks. The game has a unique design of it's own, where the Tron legacy atmospheric world makes your hearth beat faster. Overall controlls with either keyboard or controller is simple to use, where you get a decent movement of your car. The game allows you to spin, jump, fly and drive with a health bar that might overheat to destroy you. Every map or custom map through workshop has checkpoints that resets/cooling it down.The music is fantastic, and makes you play all day, unfortunately the game has not unlocked the rest of the singleplayer, since it's in progress. The singleplayer campagin on the other hand throws you straight to basic's and into a interesting world of escape.Here is a demo:

								I'd honestly say this is one of the most entertaining racing games I've ever played. There's definitely not many games that require you to jump from wall to wall at high speeds while avoiding traps like lasers and saws while listening to fitting music before you've even completed the tutorial. Also the visuals look awesome, but it's not so overdone that you can't figure out what's going on.It's one of those rare games where you can join a server, find one of the best players in the entire game, and still enjoy yourself.To get the most out of it you'll need to play the community levels, since there's not many official levels. It's not a problem though, since a lot of community levels are on par with the official ones, and some are even better (plus the files are usually less than 1mb, so having hundreds of levels downloaded barely takes up any space).Anyway, here's a quick summary:+Looks and feels awesome+Challenging but not frustrating+Music fits perfectly+Hundreds of quality community levels+Procedural track generation (very early stages so will get a lot better)+Doesn't get annoying if you keep failing+Gravity doesn't even matter as long as you're going fast enough+Improved enough from Nitronic Rush to justify buying-Still no AI/ghosts (they'll probably be coming soon, but offline is a little lonely currently)-Some of the dynamic obsticles can feel luck based, which gets annoying if you're going for a fast time-Possibly a little harder to get good at if you have no controller			"

								This game is one of the best I've played all year. A good level of challenge, combined with beautiful graphics, and very smooth controls and gameplay. The Online is also very good. AND IT'S STILL IN EARLY ACCESS!!! I can't wait to see what else this game will have to offer in the future.			"

								Ok, before you buy this game, go play Nitronic Rush. If you like that you will like this. Distance is a Tron-esqe racing game where you speed along floating roads and fly through obstacles at very high speeds.Gameplay-10/10The gameplay in Distance is absolutely flawless. The controls feel fluid and are very responsive, and I know that I am in control of my car at all times. The gameplay consists of driving along roads at high speeds while dodging obstacles like buzzsaws, lasers, walls, spinning cylinders of death spikes, and so on. While you usually just drive along roads, you also can fly. Everything about the driving and flying is great. There is also a boost system that reminds me of Excite Truck, which was my favorite racing game until I got Distance. Also, if you get cut by lasers, you can still drive with half of your car. That's probably my favorite thing in Distance.Story-N/AThe adventure mode isn't finished yet, so I can't really review it right now.Multiplayer-10/10I haven't encountered any lag in multiplayer yet. You have to get to the finish as fast as possible, trying to beat the other players. However, the other players appear as ghosts and cannot effect your vehicle, making the race into more of a synonomous time trial. Graphics-10/10The graphics remind me of Nitronic Rush, but have a glossy new feel that fits with the atmosphere very well. Overall-10/10For what it is, Distance is a fantastic game. Even though it is essentially a remake of Nitronic Rush, it does everything right. It runs well on lower spec PCs, you can play it on Mac and Linux as well as PC, there's a level editor with workshop support. Just keep in mind that it is a racing game.			"

								One of the best games to fill your Linux game colection, maybe one of the bests if you like arcade racing games.Expect some crazy experience:-Zero gravity zones, (lot of potential here)-Loops.-Jump to wall driving.-Obstacles- Fly trought lasers.-Drive with half car.-And the best, take all that to make your custom track.The cons:-Hard to start if you go straight forward to Arcade and Custom tracks, so do Adventure first.-Sometimes fly mode makes you get lost in the track. Also, on the other hand, makes some sections too easy.-Some crazy tracks from community lower the performance with old pc becose abuse of lasers, obstacles... (although there are some realy cool tracks that run very smoth).			"

								AWESOME GAME. After 110+ MINUTES(not Hours) I can make a review, this game meets my expectations, the driving is simple andcomplicated at the same time which makes the game feeling quite exciting. At this time my review starts to be great but... the game lacks of more campaign levels, there's only one car model, no FPS view(Yeah it would add more difficulty but could be cool.), Sadly(or hopefully) no mobile version(Yeah for peoples who don't have a Portable Computer it would be cool), but apart of those missing things this game is a piece of fun, nothing to add about the funness and the difficulty of it. Truly a masterpiece. This game is in my top 10 PC games of 2015.And this concludes my review for this masterpiece. I won't put this game in ""Not recommended"" because I would find that stupid tonot recommend Distance.			"

								This has to be one of the best ""under the radar"" games on steam.   The environments are beautiful, the gameplay is fast, the controls feel great, the multiplayer is good, there are some very interesting custom tracks from the community, and the developers are active as well.  The only thing that I would count as a potential negative against it is that there are not a lot of people playing it online.  Hence, ""under the radar"".			"

Early Access Review
								tl;dr: I had a lot of fun with the game. It was decently challenging, has great visuals, a fun concept, excellent physics, an awesome soundtrack, and even online multiplayer for just being an early access game.Honestly, my only complaints about this game is that the car does not feel heavy enough. I do not know if this was the intent of the developers, but you are able to turn on a dime at high speeds and it feels more like the world is rotating under you rather than you actually turning the car. To go along with this, I would have wished that drifting the car was added into the game, as it would make taking corners at high speeds all the more fun, especially since it could be incorporated into the trick system. Another problem I had was that segments that required you to continually boost, jump, and rotate the car at the same time were difficult because all three of those functions use the right side of the controller and I had a hard time rotating the car once I got it in the air because I had to keep my thumb on the boost button instead of the right thumb stick. I know that this is easily fixed by the fact that other buttons on the controller perform the same functions, like left bumper on an xbox 360 controller activating the boost, but since in the tutorial, it was stated that the A button is used to hold a boost, you could probably see how this would become difficult if others did not know that multiple buttons did the same thing.All in all, the car should behave more like a car, and the tutorial needs to state that other buttons perform the same functions as others, but it was a fun experience playing this game and I hope to see what becomes of it further down the road.

								If you like tron, eye candy, fast paced arcade racing, a good car to look at, dropping acid and a chill mixtape, this IS the game for you. It's a beautiful enveloping experience with the music and racetracks they've put together. Escape into your monitor or span it along 3 monitors or♥♥♥♥♥♥even a large flatscreen, it's one hell of a ride. For me, each level/map/sector has its own unique feel and difficulty.If you play with a controller, it'll be a breeze, however if you're a keyboard user it'll take some getting use to. The controls aren't an instant WTF DO I DO. The game slowly introduces you to new tricks and tips for controlling your sexy little car. The physics glitch out at times for me, when I'm performing wall jumps my car will instantly flip around when I launch off the surface and it'll slide toward the gravitational pull of the map. If you're on a map with a portal and you go backward thru it, you'll get stuck in an infinite loop or sometimes spawn below the map (but you can blow yourself up and try again). The flying mechanics could use a bit of work as well. At times when I deploy the wings off a jump, the car will start rotating and gaining control of it can be tough if you’re on a keyboard. There is a lack of content for this game, but hell, the maps they've got are great and you can finish them in multiple ways with different paths. I've spent some time doing the time trial races and it's really addictive.The multiplayer functionality is good, however I haven't played it much but it is pretty fun (I'll update it as I play more online). There's usually a few (4-6) servers that have games loaded with their own maps. When racing online, there is a time limit, so if you're spectating a new dude you won't be sitting there for hours waiting for him/her to finish. All in all, I pretty sure I missed a few key aspects but nonetheless, it's a very fun game. The graphics are spectacular, the soundtrack is immersive it's a unique experience that I've lost myself in. I really hope the developers make more content for this game, it'd be a shame if they didn't because this software has potential.			"

								Distance is still in Beta, but already looks like a complete game. I have not really encountered any bugs so far and it's great fun to play solo. But it's way more fun to play split-screen with friends, you can play literally for hours. I'd highly recommend using a gamepad, it's much better than playing with a keyboard for this game.The music, while it's not what I usually listen to fits perfectly together with the game itself and the atmosphere it creates. One of the things that surprised me is the fact that it runs really well on my second, older pc, which means that for such a beautiful looking game it's really well programmed and not hard on resources at all. The level editor is complex, but great once you get used to it. There's a lot of really cool and interesting tracks in the steam workshop already which I highly recommend checking out. It also makes up for the fact that in the game itself there aren't that many different levels yet.The controls are very good for driving, but flying and walljumps are difficult to get used to in my opinion. It's pretty hard if you use a keyboard and still not easy with a gamepad (in my case an xbox360 controller).I highly recommend Distance for anyone who loves racing games and I still recommend to try it out at a friend's for anyone else.I rate this game at a solid 9/10.

It plays exactly like it looks it should play, and better. Did you eve play Wipeout on the Playstation in 1996 or some such time ago and remember the exhilerating feeling of super sonic racing? Well that's what this game brings me back to--except its wipeout for a new generation. Its got excellent graphics, great sound, wonderful arcadey controls, and in closing, if you like the looks of this game and aren't sure if its worth it, there is always the steam refund!			"

								Distance is a racing/parkour game where you drive a car which can boost, jump, rotate, and fly, and can even drive on buildings and walls, and it's awesome.While the game is in early access, you might want to ignore that tag; the dev team is active, and they plan to release the game before July this year. The game is pretty stable despite the fact it's in beta, and I haven't really found that many bugs, which is good. Adventure mode isn't complete yet, though, and there's still some refinement of the core gameplay mechancis that needs to be done - but other than that, the game's pretty much complete.There's two main game modes available - Adventure and Arcade.Adventure mode is meant to be a short story mode that also works as a tutorial for the basic game mechanics. It's currently incomplete, but the devs are hard at work on it. They don't want to spoil the full story, so they're keeping their progress on Adventure in their private internal build, and they'll release it to the public in one big update close to launch.Arcade is essentially a collection of different modes. Sprint is the main mode, where you have to get from the start to the end of the level in the quickest time possible. Speed & Style is pretty much the same as Sprint, but doing tricks to earn points will give you a faster time. Then you have Stunt, where you have to do tricks and get the highest score; Challenge, where if you die, you're out; and Trackmogrify, where you enter in a seed and the game generates a track out of that. There's also Reverse Tag in multiplayer (more on that later), which is a free-for-all battle mode where you're fighting for control of a sphere that gradually gets larger over time.While most of the game modes are fun, Stunt mode is pretty dull right now. All you really do is 1) fly in the air 2) do a bunch of spins and flips 3) land to score points 4) GOTO 1 until time runs out. The devs were planning to improve this mode AFAIK but unfortunately it might be scrapped for launch as they don't have a lot of time left now to work on stuff like this. Fortunately, they don't plan on stopping updates after launch, so this mode may return in an improved state afterwards.One thing that's pretty cool about Distance is that this isn't your traditional racer where you're restricted to the track -  this is more of a parkour/platforming game than a driving game. There's no invisible walls blocking you from skipping the track, allowing you to come up with potentionally faster routes. The road is really just a basic guide to the map layout, and being able to deviate from that route and come up with your own is pretty much the entire point. It's not covered well in the tutorial or in the videos above, which is why many players seem to miss this. I like this part of the game a lot, though, so I hope it's covered better in the full release (Actually, in the alpha, which I sadly wasn't a part of, they had tips in the loading screens, one of which was ""Feel free to drive on buildings and walls, the roads aren't always the quickest path"" - something like that needs to be re-implemented IMO) so more people are aware it and also that newbies won't call out the speedrunners for ""cheating"" when they're using a skip route.I mostly play Sprint mode, where playing the game itself is really enjoyable. I don't really know how to explain it, though - Jumping between ceilings and floors while dogding giant saws of doom and destruction at high speeds is just a lot of fun for me. I've found the game to be even more enjoyable now that I've learned the skip routes, but I still don't really know how to descibe my enjoyment or why I find it enjoyable. It's just fun.Also included in Distance is a powerful level editor with Steam Workshop support. It's a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do you can make some really cool stuff. Want to see for yourself? Just check out the workshop. There's a ton of excellent community made levels, so if you get tired of the official levels, check 'em out. Even if you're not tired of the officials, check 'em out. There's some great stuff that's been made, and because of that it's pretty much impossible to run out of content.As I mentioned a bit earlier, this game has a multiplayer mode. You can play splitscreen with friends, or you can join online servers hosted by other players, and even host your own. I haven't personally tried the splitscreen mode, but I have played online. When it comes to the multiplayer in Sprint/Speed&Style/Challenge/Trackmogrify, you're not really racing against the other players - it's basically the same as if you were playing solo, there's just other peole there. Stunt is a bit more competitive as you're trying to get the highest score, and Reverse Tag is only available in multiplayer, because it's basically a battle mode. There's no collision with the other players in online, but there is in splitscreen. To be honest, I like the no collision - it's nice that you can't be knocked out the way by other players. It just fits this game's style of gameplay more, where you're really racing against time rather than other players.I wouldn't recommend this game if you want it soley for the multiplayer, though. It's more of a singleplayer game - plus, the servers are player hosted, and that added with the fact the community is kinda small right now, there tends not to be many servers most of the time. Playing solo is still a blast though, so it's not all bad. At the very least, the small community means that it's unlikely to find someone being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and from what I've experienced the community is generally positive and helpful.The graphics are pretty nice, but some of the settings can be really intensitive. If you're experiencing low framerates, be sure to turn off realtime reflections, as that's a pretty big performance hog. There's a few bonus effects, like a stylised outlines option that increases saturation and adds an outline to everything, giving the game a slightly more cartoony look. There's also a film noir effect that makes everything black and white, and a cinematic letterbox option that adds black bars to the top and bottom of the screen to give the game a more, well, cinematic feel.The music is awesome, in my opinion. I don't really know much else to say about it as music is entirely subjective, but I just really like it. I'm a fan of electronic stuff, so it's definitely nice to me. It's also catchy and memorable (to me). As I just mentioned, though, music is entirely subjective, so your mileage may vary.There's also VR support, but I haven't tried that myself. I don't own a VR headset.Pros:[+] Very stable for a beta game[+] The game is just really fun, for me at least[+] There's no invisible walls, allowing you to come up with faster routes[+] Powerful level editor[+] Loads of community-made tracks, meaning it's basically impossible to run out of content[+] Splitscreen and online multiplayer[+] VR support[+] Graphics are good[+] Music is greatCons:[-] Stunt mode is kinda boring[-] The level editor is a little difficult to get the hang of at first[-] A small community and player-hosted servers means that there usually isn't many online games available[-] Some graphic settings significantly reduce performanceSo, yeah. I've spent the past ~2 hours on this review, and it's really long, and probably sucks. But still.I also recommend Distance's spiritual predecessor, Nitronic Rush[nitronic-rush.com], which is free and was developed by the same team, among others, as a student project at DigiPen. It's slightly different, but the core mechanics are the same, and it's also pretty fun (though I have not played NR as much as Distance).			"

								I saw this game get reviewed by OneyNG and within 5 minutes I had purchased it.This game has been constructed with player enjoyment at it's focus as it quite possiblly the most fun I have had in a racing game. It reminded me of years ago when I came across Track Mania. The game is fast paced and very intuitive, really easy to pick up. The extra game mechanincs though challenging at first become appealling and add so much depth to the possible gameplay. Not to mention I had my friends and family come check it out as it is a great competitive game, We hadn't even changed game modes. The level builder and strong community presence increases it's value as there are limitless levels which download as quick as the game is to get hooked on. It also comes with a random level generator if you feel like doing something more random. I hope this game continues to develope interest as it deserves the highest recognition.Overall it's definitely a 10 out of 10. Five fast paced high accelerating stars!			"

								Many games nowadays incorporate some ""drive-fast-and-you-don't-fall-off-the-ceiling"" mechanic, such as Grip or Distance.Although this mechanic originated around the time of the N64 and the original Playstation, Distance brought it back. This game will send you swirling though various tracks that loop, swoop, spin, and invert. You can stick to the track however it bends, but this won't achieve any record-setting lap times. To be the best, you must leave the track. You can jump onto walls and other obstacles around the world to find the quickest way to the finish line; you can even jump straight to the ceiling if it's not too high above you.That said, many workshop levels are simple roller coasters, requiring you to hold the boost without letting go. How boring, right? The best challenges this game can throw at you will have you jumping from rooftop to interstate overpass to rooftop, and will force you to dodge laser beams and sawblades the whole way. It's a bit like Meat Boy, if you're into that!			"

								The Steam early access title Distance shows lots of potential. The self described  ""survival racing"" feels a bit like Trackmania or Trials but the player is driven less by good runs and more by survival and exploration of their environment. The gameplay is rather deep, far more than I initially expected. Your car has the ability to boost but that's just the start. Wall-riding, mid-air flips, and even flying are often combined to traverse more difficult areas. I've been playing solely the adventure mode and there is much left to explore. I’m looking forward to development of this mode because it seems to hint at a more fleshed out story. A rarity in any racing game. Although, it’s still too early to say what’s under the hood I think it’s worth a ride.			"

								The trailer is badass. Most of the time when you are looking for a good game, you look at the trailer. This trailer makes this game look amazing af. IT IS!The art is very Tron inspired, the music has the perfect feel, and the handling on your car is pretty good. The idea of survival takes this racing game to a new place. With this style and feel, no racing game would be cooler to play.The only two complaints that I have is that the tricks you can pull off seem a little bland. The way the game works now, you can jump over things, fly over things, dodge things, and flip on to walls. Also, I wish I could control my car in the air a little more.Other than that, this is the greatest racing game I have ever played, and will be looking forward to new content.			"

								I've been on Steam for a while, and this is my first time bothering to write a review.This game is absorbing.  It's the game that I've been waiting for someone to make.  It's essentially a music-based racer, and it instantly reminded me of Rez from PS2 and XBLA, thrown together with elements of Burnout 3 and the original Extreme-G on the N64 (yea, I'm old).  The music is intense, the graphics are awesome, and the difficulty is just right.  However, the thing that kept me interested for a solid hour was the sense of exploration.  You'll keep playing just to see what happens next in terms of gameplay, track design and music, and the game keeps delivering.Highly recommended.			"

								Distance is a high-octane reaction-based arcade racing game set in what I can only assume to be a computer program with a sick EDM (primarily techno) soundtrack to go with it. A spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, you have only seconds to react to what's in front of you and sometimes not even that much time is given. While sometimes frustrating with no particular payoff other than beating your times, Distance is an exciting game with a cool setting and a great soundtrack. Gameplay: 8.5/10: Distance offers a variety of game modes including a short campaign, arcade sprint, stunt and style races, versus race, and split-screen up to four players. Each gameplay mode, outside of the multiplayer, is mildly lacking in replay value (unless you're a perfectionist and want to get to the top of the leaderboards which I personally could easily see myself attempting). When you enter the multiplayer it becomes an insane race for first, style points, or who can pull off the most wicked stunt. The last time I felt a game play this smooth and fun was Split/Second and that's what this game reminds me of... only if it were set in Tron.Graphics: 8/10: The setting is stunning and the tracks are intense to race on. Neon colours flash past you as you go from 0-250mph in just a few short seconds and the environment keeps up with the action you experience. However, upon closer inspection the environment isn't the most detailed setting, with speed of levels (no laps) and need for concentration aiding in the distractability from the environment itself. The car itself is physically stunning and fun to look at, particularly when you activate the thrusters or flight ability. When it explodes for the umpteenth time, you might be a little remorse at the fact that it constantly splits into the same fractal polygons and rains over the landscape below, but if you can get over that sort of thing you might just find yourself immersed in the reactive world around you, which brings us to our next point.Sound: 9/10: Arguably the star of the game is the notion that the environment reacts to the pumping techno beats and seems to simulate a synesthetic experience. The developers turn sound into visuals which vastly aid in drawing you in to the overall experience. I even found myself reacting and driving to the beat, which for some reason was always perfectly timed to the rest of the level, even if you were to crash with a digitally explosive sound. The soundtrack is genuinely something I find myself coming back to the game to enjoy over and over and over again. The car sounds beautiful and is perfectly matched to its sporty design. I keep returning to the game just to hear the music again and again. I love it that much!Last WordsDistance is a fun game for perfectionists but if you're into unlocks and specials outside of what you purchase, you'll want to look elsewhere. A visual and audible synesthetic experience that draws you in, Distance is the perfect spiritual successor to some of the most fast-paced and intense racing games on the market.8.5/10 - Give it a go, especially if you catch it on sale!

								So It took me a couple days just because once you hit the nightmare stuff it gets moderately frustrating. Best advice is keep calm and pay attention. As difficult as this gets in Distance its key. Theres a way I feel that a Hotas Dualstick controller system would do a lot better with this game than a Keyboard or Xbox 360 controller would. Thats the negatives so far.Positives are quite a few; Take Tron, a light touch of the Horror genre, and the Matrix Highways and the portals from Dystopia and you have Distance. The in game suspense gets quite affective at times. I put down the campaign a few times just to get my head clear from the in game 'stressors' but once I figured out what I was doing its quite fun. I enjoy racing games and this made my engine purr. Refract, I salute the skill put into this so far. Glad to be supporting you know, hopeful for your bright future. 10/10			"

								Full disclosure: I backed this game on kickstarter.Distance is basically what you'd get if you put Tron, a racing game, and a rave into a blender that made games.You can drive on the walls, ceilings, and basically anything else. Your car can fly!The controls feel really tight, and even when your car is damaged the physics kind of make it less annoying - having your car sliced in half and driving half a car to the next checkpoint is fairly entertaining.The game is, however, a bit short at the moment. Once you know what you're doing the story mode doesn't take very long, and neither do the other modes. There are generated levels and workshop levels, though, and there's supposed to be a story mode update at some point.Pros:- Cool car mechanics- Lots of modes- Everything glows. You can turn up the glowing if there's not enough glowing.- Replayability, level editor, random level generator- Still updating long after the kickstarter!Cons:- Really short story mode / modes in general			"

								This is really cool.......I dunno what it is exactly. It isn't a racing game.....It reminds me a lot of what Trials Evolution would be like from a first person perspective.....Sometimes it seems insanely difficult, and other times I just drift and hop right thru impossible obstacles like nothing......I love the visuals!This is a really good game to play when you are stoned!I had just bought Redout and I was gonna pass this up, I am really glad i didn't, this game is something special :)			"

Not to mention some custom realms based off of the card game.  Seriously this is the only reason I bought this game and I LOVE IT.  Plays VERY well too.  Not trying to say it's bad as a game, I just haven't tried the actual adventure, I'm that in love with these tracks.			"

								Great game for what they have so far! Looking forward to future updates.I only have a poopy/old laptop to play on but even with on the lowest possible settings for graphics I still get probably 20-40 frames. This is kinda a silly request, seeing as how I’m sure that the game runs fine on more current computers, but it would be awesome to have even more settings to be able to turn off to increase frame rates. Besides frame rate, the only other concern I had is some issues with input lag but as far as I know, those are tied to the frame rate. "

								Distance is hard to describe so I'll keep this brief. It's nothing like well-known racing games. It is far removed from Wipeout, F-Zero and any other racer that comes to mind. The closest comparison would have to be the Trackmania series, since both titles are all about getting through courses at the fastest time and have truckloads of user-made content. But Distance has deeper gameplay than Trackmania, and isn't about chaotic multiplayer challenges. Distance has more in common with platform games than racing games, and is superficially comparable to the day stages of Sonic Unleashed except that unlike that pile of garbage, Distance is an amazing game.As pointed out by others, if you are unsure of what you are getting yourself into, try Nitronic Rush. A free predecessor to this game.			"

								""Car Platformer""That's the term I'd use to describe this game.  It's a car platformer.  It's everything great about video game car physics, plus more.  You can jump, you can spin, you can fly, and for the most part you have the freedom to do so whenever you want.One of the greatest things about this game is definitely the freedom.  I don't like when racing games are just a track you have to go fast on.  In this game, though, if you get bored of the normal drive you can jump off the side and drive over all of the buildings and props alongside the track.  Granted, in the game world there aren't going to be a lot of extra places to go, but still.  Navigable scenery is a plus.There's also the unnecessarily entertaining aspect of it where you can continue to drive after having your car sliced in half lengthwise.  That's a bit of an oddball feature that makes for some fun.			"

								Basically, you control this sci-fi car in which you can fly, jump, do crazy tricks and even keep running after getting chopped in half. The developers based this on an older game with very similar mechanics named Nitronic Rush, which I also loved.They were inspired by NR, not based on it, as I thought before.Love the stylized outlines graphics, the killer soundtrack, challenging gameplay. When I saw the trailers I thought my laptop wouldn't run it, but to my surprise, it runs smoothly on ultra settings with Intel graphics. I've played the adventure mode about twenty times already, and I really hope the developers add more levels. There are tons of workshop levels to play.			"

								Up until recently one of the most original racing games I've ever played. If you like games like f-zero, track mania and Wipeout then you will probably also like this one.Distance primarly focuses on survival through stunting up, over and under things as you make your way through countless of haphazard areas full of razors and spiked steamrollers. At a certain moment the track starts to rotate horizontally and you even get to drive upside down, straight up and every other angle you can imagine. After a certain while you don't even really know what up and down is anymore, was it not for the arrow on the back of your car that indicates which way down actually is. I do however find myself never really looking at the thing as most community made tracks are so fast and require your full attention. After a while you will be constantly propelling yourself forward with the turbo, jump and angle your car 45 degrees with the thrusters and as soon as you land things might start popping up left and right trying to slice your car in half. You jump on the straight orientated road again and go through a portal which then suddenly leaves you hanging in mid air. The upbeat music has stopped and been replaced for the muffled sounds of you trying to maneuver your car in zero-g. There is also a story, which is something about you being inside of a computer-thingy which is infected by a virus. Which will become apparent in the storyline mode, but not so much right now. This game mainly thrives from the steam workshop integration as there are a lot of custom maps which can leave you playing this game for a long time.			"

								Ok, so I spent like 10$ on this game, and believe me, last game I've bought for more than 5$ was probably gta4 around 3 years ago. Why did I do that? Simply because I've fallen in love with its prequel, nitronic rush. You can check it out, i think it's 100% free to download.Imo, compared to NR, Distance still lacks these perfectly designed, not-so-trivial campaign levels. In return we get unlimited amount of tracks from the community, and some of them are really beautiful, some quite surprising, some surprisingly creative.Multiplayer works and it's pretty fun, haven't checked splitscreen yet (but it is there).Also, I can't really imagine playing this game without gamepad. My friend played on keyboard and, while he still had really good time with the game, he couldn't micro his movement while freefalling (or in 0G) that well.So, my recomendation: Download NR, try it for yourself if you like it, and then throw some money at these guys, because I think they really deserve it.

								Though there's not much to the game at it's current state, this game is a really fun experimental survival racing experience. If you've never played nitronic rush before, I would highly recommend giving it a try because it shares a very simmilar playing style. this game features racing at 999999999 Km/h, Being cut into five peices and still being able to get to the next checkpoint, various gravity shifts, flying a car, super mega turbo jets of doom and last but not least, customizable car... colours. (I really hope they add in a actual custom cars thing though.) This game was a great experience for me. There's also a great active community supplying levels left and right. Is it worth 22 bucks? some people will say yes and some people will say -Eesh-. Like I said, there's not much to the game as of this review, it is still in a very early state of developpement but has the potential to grow.... SO much. UPDATE:After playing more, I've realized that there is some severe problems in terms of taxing a GPU. for example, on some levels I get sub 50 fps though I clearly should run that slow considering I have an overclocked Radeon 7970 that can run almost anything at 60 fps no problem. this game shouldn't be an exeption especially with it not that stunning graphics. IN SHORT: people with low-end graphics solutions should wait this out until there is some better graphics optimisations.			"

								I give it ... Five Stars!If you're thinkin about getting it, get it! This is actually my first time posting a review of any kind, and that should say something.  I saw this game on the store page, bought it, and it was worth every penny.  This game is perfect for someone who is looking for a racing game but wants to step away from the traditional stick-shifter, and move in the direction of a sci-fi obstacle course where your pilot a highly advanced supercar equipped for land, air, and zero gravity travel!  It made me think of Sonic All-Stars and maybe the baby of Kario Kart and Portal or something.  I've never seen anything like it, very original gameplay and you can even make your own levels.  I just recently purchased the game and I've spent seven hours on it.  Refract did an amazing job and I wish them the best of luck! If I could make a request for the next update; pick up items for versus style gameplay, and a shuffle option for maps! That would be pretty radical.One last thing, the introduction video was very exciting and I actually saw a huge potential for storyline development.  I'm eager to see where it goes, I know you guys won't disappoint!P.s., It was awesome.Edit: I noticed the design for the car would actually be usable design for an all terrain sports car.  Just thought I would add that and cross my fingers that someone might comment regarding the car's design.			"

								So happy to have found this beautiful game. It has a level editor and a tutorial, and although it definitely takes some getting used to, will surely be taking a bunch of my time. The community levels already begin to show what can be done, the tracks are very adjustable, things like jumps from one track to another where one track is at 90 degrees (wall) or 180 degrees (cieling) relative to the other. Lots of decorations available too in the editor. Amazing value for the price, no bugs as far as I've seen, and works fine in three-screen surround. The nVidia 3D surround still seems to need some work, but already looks very cool.			"

								This is a great racing game that reminds me of TrackMania Nations Forever, but with so much content added to it. It requires skill like trackmania but adds a level of control to it that is incredible. This game has it all, jumping, flying, directional thrusters, zero g maps, very well done glitch effects, crazy obstacles that can cut your car into chunks, and regeneration checkpoints. The tools on the car are great fun and also allow you to recover in incredible ways that would otherwise make this game a demanding test to always play perfectly.This game runs great and the only minor issue I had was with the keymapping on my logitech gamepad.core i7-860radeon 5770If you want a racing game that gives you incredible tools to use with skill, this is worth a look.

Monolith comes close, but doesn't quite reach it. There's a variety of Community levels, but the base game could seriously use some more difficult tracks.			"

								Think Trackmania, Portal and Tron all mashed together. I absolutely love it! I loved Nitronic Rush but thought it felt a bit old. Then I got Distance, problem solved. Beatiful graphics and an epic soundtrack together with the lumo/electro/whateveritis lighting give it the most amazing atmosphere. And make it trippy as hell. Seriously, wow.The simple mechanic of the jumping and the directional thrusters to let you do tricks and twist the car in the air add so much more to this and put it ahead of all the other racing games I've tried. There is nothing else like in this game when you are moving at high speed and rapidly jumping and flipping to get onto the next piece of track.The obstacles can vary in function, which is nice considering there are only 3 or 4 types (saw blade, laser, barrier, but some can move, some can appear only when you're nearby, some can be different sizes, etc, the variety works here). Furthermore these obstabcles have a signifigant impact on you, hitting a sawblade on the side can send you spinning off the track, skimming too close to a laser will chop off a piece of your car leaving you with half a car, etc.Then there's replayability, so much of it, really. Many of the levels have multiple ways to get to the finish, some are marked 'detour' some you have to discover by keen viewing or complete accident, some are quick, some are harder/longer, some are simply an alternate. The currently released official levels don't show this as clearly but this game is in beta so don't judge. This brings us to another feature, the built in level editor. This gives the community a chance to make their own levels and if you look at the workshop page you will see... so many levels. And they are all great! They also make brilliant use of the whole 'multiple ways to get to the end' idea and have created some awesome looking tracks.Pros:Beatiful GraphicsAwesome soundtrackSlick controls (I would reccomend a controller though)Tracks with multiple paths -> Replayability for dauysCommunity levels -> Even more replayability (did I mention that these community levels are actually brilliant?)Cons:Keyboard controls are iffy and take some getting used to, even if you normally play keyboard and mouseThe whole 'early access' thing, aside from community levels, it does feel a little incomplete (but that's because it's in Beta still).Overall, for $20 I would not hesitate for a second to try this game. If anyone wants to try before you buy kinda thing, look for 'Nitronic Rush', it was essentially the prototype for this game, but it's free and will give you a feel for the control system, the jumping and twisting, the flying, and the trippy tracks. Really, if you like racing games and want something different, or if you enjoy games like trackmania, give this a go. It's fantastic.			"

								DISTANCE IS FINALLY HERE!!! PRAISE THE SUN!!!Distance, the most innovative racing game on the market. The immaculate child of Tron, F-Zero, and dubstep put together. Ever since I got hooked Nitronic Rush (the game's free predecessor coded entirely out of C++), I have been waiting for a true sequel or at least multiplayer of some sort. Then I heard about the Kickstarter for Distance Alpha and I was ONE DAY LATE!!! The game has been in development ever since the last Nitronic Rush update in 2012, maybe even before that. And now they release this game as Early Access? Hah! This Indie game is more full and complete-looking than many AAA titles on the market today! Distance is practically the only game I bought on steam for full price, because I think it is worth the full $20. (Note: in the world of $60 AAA games like CoD, $20 for a multiplayer game like this is pretty darn good)GameplayDistance is ""racing"" game but most of the time your objective is to simply survive the track. Fall off the beaten path, and it is up to you to get back on. Your car has boosters, rotational thrusters and even wings, but that doesn't make it easy. You are constantly riding on walls, doing tricks off jumps, keeping track of gravity, and avoiding evil robotic obstacles. These include but are not limited to: giant buzz saws, rollers, spikey rollers, lasers that cut your car in half, robots that fly ahead of you and land in your way, walls that pop up from the ground, and my personal favorite: the lamp post. The faster you ride on a wall, the more you stick to it. When you make a checkpoint, your overheat-meter goes down and your car is regenerated if it got cut by a laser. You can also reduce your overheating by landing tricks.The game supports singleplayer and online multiplayer (an upgrade from Nitronic Rush), sports a user-friendly level editor, and even allows splitscreen with gamepads (a nice touch). Downloading community levels is easy via Steam Workshop. There are the normal racing game modes, and some different ones like ""tag"", and ""speed and style"" where doing tricks will reduce your overall time.FlavorDistance would be nowhere NEAR what it is today without its awesome, intense flavor! The setting is very Tron-inspired. As you ride down the colorful circuit-y roads which twist and turn through the cybernetic cityscape, you can't help but admire the fact that everything is flashy and genuinely cool. Even some community level creators add a different flavor to the game with their levels; they will thrill you with all manner of trickery. Many things that light up in the game pulses with the intense beat. Which leads me to another topic: The Music. Oh God the music is amazing. It falls in that dubstep/techno genre. It blends SO WELL with the visuals of the game. And lemme tell you something: I hate dubstep, techno, or whatever it is with a PASSION. But for some reason the music in Distance, its just different. I can't explain it... but it sounds great.Distance, by the way, is appropriate and available for all ages. There is no language, gore (obviously), or even words spoken by a person. The community level designers are clean. You don't even need a mouse to play.I love Distance. It should be clear to you by now. PLEASE BUY IT!! The one downfall of this game, (mainly because it is in early access) is that it lacks a full player base, sometimes I cannot find a multiplayer game at all. It needs more players to survive. I feel this game can become a prime example to the gaming community, of how Indie games should be developed, put on Early Access, and released. That is why I recommend Distance to every gamer.TL;DR: Buy Distance.			"

The singleplayer campaign, while currently short does a good job at enviromental storytelling and I hope they do more with this in the future.The ingame level editor has allowed the community to create some really cool and creative maps that have their own style and feel.In an era where the Unity engine is used and abused by asset-flipping amatures, clogging up Early Access and Greenlight, it's so nice to see proper developers show the true potential of the Unity engine.The game looks, sounds, plays and feels great and is worth every penny of its asking price.

 Best early access game i've ever purchased 	Ok, if you've ever played (and liked) Nitronic Rush, then you will love Distance. The music is amazing, visuals are extremely good, the game is extremely smooth, as are the controls. There are multiple Game-modes, a level editor and Steam Workshop support, meaning you won't ever run out of levels to play.The games story and challenge levels are also extremely well designed, with shortcuts, unique levels and a story (which though isn't complete yet is still awesome). If you're like me and enjoy trying to get the best time and rank on each mode, then you will enjoy it. Distance is one of few games that i genuinely enjoy speedrunning levels on.The game states that it is in early access, so there are some bugs, and the story isn't quite finished. I personally, haven't encountered any bugs, and there are enough levels on the workshop for me not to care so much about the unfinished story. If anything, i look forward to playing new story levels. I can quite happily say that this is the best early access game i have ever purchased.			"

With this style and feel, no racing game would be cooler to play.The only two complaints that I have is that the tricks you can pull off seem a little bland. The way the game works now, you can jump over things, fly over things, dodge things, and flip on to walls. Also, I wish I could control my car in the air a little more.Other than that, this is the greatest racing game I have ever played, and will be looking forward to new content.			"

								A true diamond in the rough!  Great potential if it can just distill its essence and decide what it truly wants to be!  Strongly reminiscent of Wipeout series from PS3 era, a gravity optional racing sim with the strangest of tracks and perspectives.What do I mean by that? There are a lot of cool racing concepts (twitch avoidance, aerial ballet for boost cooldown, wall running, and completely tron-esque warping (level design? seamless loading?) throughout the levels. It's scattershot throwing stuff at the player to see what sticks. Some of it is really intuitive, other stuff not so much.Graphics: Supremely superb. Eye candy galore.Level design: Laid-back to Masochistic. Controls: Amazing and bad. Defaults to tell you to use the face buttons for boost and jump; but then when in the air you need to use right stick -- which your thumb can't really do. The 'advanced' controls of using r1 l1 make a lot more sense and should be the defaults.  Inverting flight controls (Y axis) only makes sense...but inverting flight doesn't invert thrusters which makes the zero gravity portions unbearable.@developerTHANK YOU for detecting a ps4 controller and just using it natively!  Supports plug and play with ds4 without having to use an xinput wrapper, then customs the icons in the game to circle square instead of abxy.Overall, not much yet (not counting the gargantuan amount of workshop fodder) but has so much potential!  Can't wait to see this fleshed out!  Full price? a bit much. On sale-- you must buy this.			"

								So It took me a couple days just because once you hit the nightmare stuff it gets moderately frustrating. Best advice is keep calm and pay attention. As difficult as this gets in Distance its key. Theres a way I feel that a Hotas Dualstick controller system would do a lot better with this game than a Keyboard or Xbox 360 controller would. Thats the negatives so far.Positives are quite a few; Take Tron, a light touch of the Horror genre, and the Matrix Highways and the portals from Dystopia and you have Distance. The in game suspense gets quite affective at times. I put down the campaign a few times just to get my head clear from the in game 'stressors' but once I figured out what I was doing its quite fun. I enjoy racing games and this made my engine purr. Refract, I salute the skill put into this so far. Glad to be supporting you know, hopeful for your bright future. 10/10			"

								Distance is a high-octane reaction-based arcade racing game set in what I can only assume to be a computer program with a sick EDM (primarily techno) soundtrack to go with it. A spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush, you have only seconds to react to what's in front of you and sometimes not even that much time is given. While sometimes frustrating with no particular payoff other than beating your times, Distance is an exciting game with a cool setting and a great soundtrack. Gameplay: 8.5/10: Distance offers a variety of game modes including a short campaign, arcade sprint, stunt and style races, versus race, and split-screen up to four players. Each gameplay mode, outside of the multiplayer, is mildly lacking in replay value (unless you're a perfectionist and want to get to the top of the leaderboards which I personally could easily see myself attempting). When you enter the multiplayer it becomes an insane race for first, style points, or who can pull off the most wicked stunt. The last time I felt a game play this smooth and fun was Split/Second and that's what this game reminds me of... only if it were set in Tron.Graphics: 8/10: The setting is stunning and the tracks are intense to race on. Neon colours flash past you as you go from 0-250mph in just a few short seconds and the environment keeps up with the action you experience. However, upon closer inspection the environment isn't the most detailed setting, with speed of levels (no laps) and need for concentration aiding in the distractability from the environment itself. The car itself is physically stunning and fun to look at, particularly when you activate the thrusters or flight ability. When it explodes for the umpteenth time, you might be a little remorse at the fact that it constantly splits into the same fractal polygons and rains over the landscape below, but if you can get over that sort of thing you might just find yourself immersed in the reactive world around you, which brings us to our next point.Sound: 9/10: Arguably the star of the game is the notion that the environment reacts to the pumping techno beats and seems to simulate a synesthetic experience. The developers turn sound into visuals which vastly aid in drawing you in to the overall experience. I even found myself reacting and driving to the beat, which for some reason was always perfectly timed to the rest of the level, even if you were to crash with a digitally explosive sound. The soundtrack is genuinely something I find myself coming back to the game to enjoy over and over and over again. The car sounds beautiful and is perfectly matched to its sporty design. I keep returning to the game just to hear the music again and again. I love it that much!Last WordsDistance is a fun game for perfectionists but if you're into unlocks and specials outside of what you purchase, you'll want to look elsewhere. A visual and audible synesthetic experience that draws you in, Distance is the perfect spiritual successor to some of the most fast-paced and intense racing games on the market.8.5/10 - Give it a go, especially if you catch it on sale!

								In great shape for an early access beta. The driving is smooth and action packed with sudden jumps, turns and flight needed. Two problems: 1. The boost doesn't really feel like much of a boost, in many areas there is not much of a sense of speed, so when I boost, I dont feel it. 2. The rotate mechanics for moving to walls and ceilings feels off using the right stick. I would prefer using the shoulder buttons for rotation. Plus after jumping and rotating to face a wall, the vehicle often did not gravitate towards the wall, but kept on the same gravitational plane. I do really like the game and am looking forward to final release.			"

You can do flips, fly, use boost, and just generally do what you want with your insane, tron-like vehicles.I've played through the official content in splitscreen (which works flawlessly) and the community content introduces a new challenge. I hope to see a more coherent single player game because the mechanics of this game are fantastic.			"

								As a programmer, I can appreciate how much time, effort, and stress goes into a project of this magnitude with a team as small as Refract. As a result, the game took quite a while to be released. However, it was well worth the wait- they did an amazing job! The level editor is my favorite part. Refract's strategy of utilizing their growing fanbase really makes this game unique. There are hundreds of tracks for this game from different people and their different ideas, rather than a team of a few people making tracks for their own game. The game is also really easy to learn, even if you haven't played their first game, and it is more than a racing game. There are other exciting game modes. There is a fast-paced survival aspect to each race with tons of obstacles that you need to avoid or your car will be torn to shreds. But each race is only as hard as you want it to be! Purchase the game and you will see what I mean. I want to recommend this game to anyone and everyone, and if anyone at Refract stumbles upon this review, I want to let you know you really knocked it out of the park this time! Great game!			"

								This game will make you re-imagine everything you thought you knew about racing games.It's an art game in its own right: a total genre-bender. It's like TRON meets Blade Runnermeets Black Rock City at night. It's hard not to get lost in the visuals.Graphic are breathtaking, even at lower settings (for those of us who don't want to turnour slow laptops into molten metal). Speaking of molten metal, the lasers are merciless,and thoroughly awesome. You can slice your car in half down the plane of symmetry andstill recover if you can steer your glowing hunk of car thru a green regeneration hoop.Gameplay is intense but forgiving, even for the casual gamer like me who's a novice atracing games and flight simulators. Skills like the 90° wall jumps, mid-air rotation, cominginto and out of a glide, etc. take practice, but they won't frustrate you into rage-quitting.My only complaint is that it has all EDM/techno-style music, which can get droning andrepetitive (in my opinion). That's part of the ambiance that the artists wished to convey,and I respect them for it, but I leave the music turned off.			"

When I saw the trailers I thought my laptop wouldn't run it, but to my surprise, it runs smoothly on ultra settings with Intel graphics.

								This game does everything right. I usually don't play racing games (I have none on my steam account), but I decided to pick this one up. The atmosphere, the colour, the mystery, and the overall mind-bending aspects of this game make it my favourite game that I've gotten so far. At first glance, it will just seem like a colourful driving game, but seriously, I have found EVERYTHING that I've wanted in a racing game here, it's fast paced, challenging (but not too difficult once you get into it), and certain aspects like spinning around to jump on upside-down surfaces, or suddenly having the gravity turn off and learning to adjust your playstyle make it super addictiveThis game is also packed with lore, but it's never explicitly shoved in your face. The story mode seems to be about some kind of society that released... something, but that's all I've been able to figure out so far. I don't want to spoil anything either, but every detail of the adventure mode is packed with information about what happened. The adventure mode makes me feel like I'm delving into the past, trying to uncover what happened to this society. I've actually played the adventure mode three times now just because of how awesome it feels, it's so fun, and there are a lot of parts that feel so ominous, like I'm watching the end of the world but I don't entirely understand how it happened. The starting cut scene, that just shows the car starting, gives tons of information on the story, but you won't realize it unless you play it through again, and even the loading screens give you a glimpse into what is going onOverall I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Every aspect of it comes together to make a masterpiece. One thing I'd recommend is making sure you have the right hardware to be able to run it, because the game is just so freaking awesome and having any sort of lag would take away from the experience (you can change the visual settings and that does help, but again the game looks so amazing on full quality)10/10, I can't wait to see this game when it's completely finished, despite how polished it is already			"

								Up until recently one of the most original racing games I've ever played. If you like games like f-zero, track mania and Wipeout then you will probably also like this one.Distance primarly focuses on survival through stunting up, over and under things as you make your way through countless of haphazard areas full of razors and spiked steamrollers. At a certain moment the track starts to rotate horizontally and you even get to drive upside down, straight up and every other angle you can imagine. After a certain while you don't even really know what up and down is anymore, was it not for the arrow on the back of your car that indicates which way down actually is. I do however find myself never really looking at the thing as most community made tracks are so fast and require your full attention. After a while you will be constantly propelling yourself forward with the turbo, jump and angle your car 45 degrees with the thrusters and as soon as you land things might start popping up left and right trying to slice your car in half. You jump on the straight orientated road again and go through a portal which then suddenly leaves you hanging in mid air. The upbeat music has stopped and been replaced for the muffled sounds of you trying to maneuver your car in zero-g. There is also a story, which is something about you being inside of a computer-thingy which is infected by a virus. Which will become apparent in the storyline mode, but not so much right now. This game mainly thrives from the steam workshop integration as there are a lot of custom maps which can leave you playing this game for a long time.			"

								Ok, so I spent like 10$ on this game, and believe me, last game I've bought for more than 5$ was probably gta4 around 3 years ago. Why did I do that? Simply because I've fallen in love with its prequel, nitronic rush. You can check it out, i think it's 100% free to download.Imo, compared to NR, Distance still lacks these perfectly designed, not-so-trivial campaign levels. In return we get unlimited amount of tracks from the community, and some of them are really beautiful, some quite surprising, some surprisingly creative.Multiplayer works and it's pretty fun, haven't checked splitscreen yet (but it is there).Also, I can't really imagine playing this game without gamepad. My friend played on keyboard and, while he still had really good time with the game, he couldn't micro his movement while freefalling (or in 0G) that well.So, my recomendation: Download NR, try it for yourself if you like it, and then throw some money at these guys, because I think they really deserve it.

								Was a big fan of Nitronic Rush so of course I was excited to get this game even though it is early access. Playing through the Adventure mode was very painful. Took too long to train you on the controls and I felt like it was holding me back. Ended up saying screw it and when into arcade mode. Man was I at home there. Fun times and let me free to play and enjoy. Played a few tracks and decided to not ask for a refund. Also very happy with how well this runs on my Linux Gaming Rig with a Radeon 7870 and open source driver.			"

								So far its a great racing game (especially for us non-racing game players). The art style is very colorful and appealing, invoking a bit of Tron's art style. So far the graphics have held up really well, maintaining a high fps even on my laptop and on the highest settings (something that not many AAA games at release can boast!)Look forward to seeing what they do with the story, though its pretty fun in arcade mode as well. Its a great game to have Steam Workshop support for, which already has produced some interesting and fun mods.			"

								This is a great racing game that reminds me of TrackMania Nations Forever, but with so much content added to it. It requires skill like trackmania but adds a level of control to it that is incredible. This game has it all, jumping, flying, directional thrusters, zero g maps, very well done glitch effects, crazy obstacles that can cut your car into chunks, and regeneration checkpoints. The tools on the car are great fun and also allow you to recover in incredible ways that would otherwise make this game a demanding test to always play perfectly.This game runs great and the only minor issue I had was with the keymapping on my logitech gamepad.core i7-860radeon 5770If you want a racing game that gives you incredible tools to use with skill, this is worth a look.

								Distance, cool name, nice eye-candy, very unique, and it has so much potential. I don't normally play any sort of racing game beside maybe the occasional mobile app but Distance really caught my eye. I watched a few videos on the game and it looked like it really gave the players something new to experience. Then I got it, I was right about that, I didn't know a racing/car game could be so cool, the multiplayer is fun, their map creator was a great idea, and once I found out I could customize my car, I had everything I wanted in this game. The only game with a racing tag in my library is Distance and there's a reason for that, it gives me a new impression on racing games and I can't wait for more of this game. Keep up the good work Refract Studios.			"

 Best early access game i've ever purchased 	Ok, if you've ever played (and liked) Nitronic Rush, then you will love Distance. The music is amazing, visuals are extremely good, the game is extremely smooth, as are the controls. There are multiple Game-modes, a level editor and Steam Workshop support, meaning you won't ever run out of levels to play.The games story and challenge levels are also extremely well designed, with shortcuts, unique levels and a story (which though isn't complete yet is still awesome). If you're like me and enjoy trying to get the best time and rank on each mode, then you will enjoy it. Distance is one of few games that i genuinely enjoy speedrunning levels on.The game states that it is in early access, so there are some bugs, and the story isn't quite finished. I personally, haven't encountered any bugs, and there are enough levels on the workshop for me not to care so much about the unfinished story. If anything, i look forward to playing new story levels. I can quite happily say that this is the best early access game i have ever purchased.			"

								Distance reminds me greatly of hotwheels Velocity X,* but with some key differences in gameplay: the controls feel fluid, and more importantly intuitive, with an excellent curve in difficulty that teaches you as you progress rather than all at once in a short bitter tutorial.What really struck me in distance was how relaxing it was. Usually when I look to play a racing game I'm expecting fast, adrenline pumping action and while the game didn't lack the action everything added together was a thouroughly calming experience.I feel this game has great potential, and no I don't mean the ""It'll be good someday"" potential, but a game that's already good that can become top notch. With modding support**, a few gameplay tweaks, and potentially configurable ai*** I feel the game would be able to reach a much broader audience and become not just a top notch title, but a classic.*For those of you gaming back then!**everyone loves a street race***That sounds difficult just saying that!

								A ton of fun, definetely worth the holiday pricing!As of this date, beware of running without Vsync, my graphics card was working itself to death running the game at 400 fps, you can lock it to 60 or 30 fps in the options and i reccomend that to any newcomer.			"

								This game is amazing.It is a must for anyone who has any interest in racing games. It is that good, and it's only in beta. I am looking forward to seeing it evolve.However, I do have a few cons to the game, one of which is rather major for me.- Requires internet to start the gameThe system requirements in the Steam Store do not tell you this, but it fails to get to the main menu if you are not connected to the internet. But as soon as you get to the main menu, you can disconnect. I'm sure it's not a problem for most people, but I have limited internet access.The rest are minor things:- would like to have more than 7 profiles for all my friends who like to play splitscreen with me- would like to be able to save more than 7 custom pain jobs for my cars (I love car customization)- this may be added later on, but I would like more car options, like different car stylesEven with these things, the game is epic.Totally recommend!!

								As a big fan of the original and completely amazing Nitronic Rush (the dev's college videogame project which this game is based on. It's a free game too, so you have no excuse not to play it), I absolutely love this game. There's already plenty of text on this page that describes the game, but that can't really do it justice. Here's an idea! If you wanna know if this game is for you, go and download Nitronic Rush for free from http://nitronic-rush.com/ and give it a try. If you like it, this game is very similar, only 6x the awesomeness. :)			"

								I bought Distance about a year ago; it's my 5th-highest ranking game in terms of hours played, so this being that high up is saying something.Pro's* Easy to learn, hard to master driving. You'll crash a lot but will rarely hate it and rage quit.* Car flying-mechanic and road-transferring mechanic pose a rewarding challenge.* Excellent music.* Very activite Steam workshop community. You'll never run out of maps to race on.* Trippy-as-hell-in-a-good way visuals.Con's* Few multiplayer server; have never seen 3+ hosts when browsing for multi-player games. Hosting myself worked fine though.* Some levels/obstacles are frustating hard.Tips/Other Notes:* Campaign is unfinished. That's fine, this is early access. * Still play the campaign if you're 100% new to the game.* Best with a controller, not impossible with a keyboard though. Some top players play on keyboard, actually, which boggles my mind.* Rebind controls to your liking. The defaults are fine, but after a while, you may find yourself struggling with some bindings that are hard to reach. Example: I rebound my brake button to 'X' on my X360 controller for those rare occasions I brake/reverse and put the ground-hugging thruster on my left trigger.			"

								This game has been on my list for a while, and I finally bought it. Maybe you're like me and you just wanted a nifty racing game with bots. Unfortunately, there aren't any bots, and I haven't minded one bit, nor have I touched the multiplayer. The tracks are all beautiful. I've downloaded 75 workshop tracks and all but three of them were fun, some were absolute gems. The controls are doable, I use a gamepad with a custom sort of setup that works for me, you'll find one that works for you.It's almost a puzzle racer, because you have to figure out how to solve the particular sections of particular tracks. And when you do, doing it at super high speed is very fun. That's why you don't need bots; the survival/puzzle racing aspect of the game makes it engrossing enough to where you forget you're alone on the track. That coupled with the awesome soundtrack and the amazeballs neon/whatever tracks makes this a really addictive, fun game. So if you're like me and you're on the fence because of the lack of bots, go for it. Price-wise, I bought it on sale. I'll almost certainly get 20 hours out it though what with how many community maps there are, but I'll certainly get 10 satisfying my 1$=1hr rule. So on sale I heavily recommend it and at full price I still say give it a try.			"

								Distance has blown me away. A stunning futuristic take on racing in a corrupt Tron like world, sat somewhere between Wipeout and Fzero but with a more twisted sense of level design and a focus on survival rather than straight up racing. Challenging and with a very active Steam Workshop community churning out loads of mind bending tracks to get stuck into. The graphics are sublime and the soundtrack is absolutely spot on - no complaints at all, well worth the money and looking forward to the final update to play the full campaign which will shed some back light on the world you are racing around. That in itself says something, I can see a huge fan base growing around the lore of this game due to the genius level design and dystopian atmosphere that the game just oozes. Buy it. Buy it now.

								In just a few hours I can already safely say that this game is awesome, unique and worth the money. Distance is a cyberpunk 80s new retrowave inspired racer. It combines flying, flipping and jumping through various winding courses and obstacles. You can go solo as a challenge for yourself or race online against others. The art design is amazing and each piece is well thought out. The music is great (check out /r/newretrowave for this type of music). And it runs silky smooth. Ultra settings on a R9 280 gets me a steady 60 fps with vsync on. Last but not least, steam workshop integration so there's unlimited courses available.And even though this game says Early Access, it's more like beta since it's already well optimized.			"

								I spent 4 hours on this game so far (I'm on mobile, so steam cloud isn't showing hours played), and I find it really enjoyable. The story mode acclimates you to the gameplay really well. Just a warning, the adventure mode is short, and they let you know that, and also, since it's early access, it cuts you out very abruptly lol. It scared me that something was wrong, but it is a new game. I read reviews of an extraordinary community, but when I went online, I didn't see many people. This may have just been my timing. Overall, this game shows great promise in integrity and growth. A note to the devs might be making the level editor more user friendly or elaborate more on how to do everything, or just point out where the instructions are better. Thanks! Great game so far!			"

								Distance is game where it takes you in a adventure in a high tech car that no one can ever dream of. From high tech boost jumps to thrusters, and wings plus turbo engine rear generator. Survive the tortue as you make your way out of the realm to find out what happened to you.			"

Early Access Review
								Fantastic game. Controls are tight, enviroment is beautiful, and even crashing feels satisfying.My only gripe would be the lack of prepackaged content. You are buying this game for access to the community levels. That said, there is an absolutely great level editor that comes with it from the start, and there's enough community levels posted to keep you occupied for a few hours every week or so.Another thing- this has to be the most well optimized game I have ever played. Seriously, I'm on a crappy, four year old Mac, and huge maps full of lighting and obstacles run smooth as butter. And this is on default settings too. The FPS in the promo is exactly what you're getting.			"

								Distance has a comfortable spot somewhere between arcade racer and gravity platformer. The game comes with a handfull of racetracks to introduce you to the futuristic anti-grav computer virus theme, but it really shines because of the workshop content. Community creations can range from hilarious, nostalgic, creative and interesting, to cruelly difficult. At some times the game can almost feel like a racing DDR as you flip between riding on walls and ceilings in rapid succession. Despite all the perspective changes, motion sickness isn't an issue.If you like speed platforming or non-simulated racing, you should have a blast playing Distance for a long time. Even if you get tired of it, come back in a few months and there'll be a slew of new community maps to impress you.			"

								Distance is a survival racing game that takes the speed and ""hit reset until perfect"" attitude from games like Trackmania.The spiritual successor to a free indie project by the same developers called Nitronic Rush, which offered the same style of gameplay as Distance, but doesn't look nearly as beautiful as this game. Set in a dystopian world, with futuristic backdrops and a car that looks gorgeous, you'll find yourself spiralling off track because of the pretty neon lights and flashy colours in the world around you.You'll spend most of your time pulling off incredible twists and rotations just to keep yourself on the track, and get that great time on each race. Even if you do fail miserably and miss a jump (which will happen a lot), you can rely on the games most interesting concept, flying cars. which, in a pickle, can get you out of any tight situation. I have to admit, the adventure mode is a little light at the moment, but the community is large and always coming up with new mind-bogglingly difficult levels for you to challenge yourself on. You can never say ""I have no levels to play"", because there will always be something strange and interesting for you to play.Even in it's early access state, Distance is a game that should be on everyone's radar, and I'm rather excited for the official release. Keep up the good work.			"

								Was a big fan of Nitronic Rush so of course I was excited to get this game even though it is early access. Playing through the Adventure mode was very painful. Took too long to train you on the controls and I felt like it was holding me back. Ended up saying screw it and when into arcade mode. Man was I at home there. Fun times and let me free to play and enjoy. Played a few tracks and decided to not ask for a refund. Also very happy with how well this runs on my Linux Gaming Rig with a Radeon 7870 and open source driver.			"

								So far its a great racing game (especially for us non-racing game players). The art style is very colorful and appealing, invoking a bit of Tron's art style. So far the graphics have held up really well, maintaining a high fps even on my laptop and on the highest settings (something that not many AAA games at release can boast!)Look forward to seeing what they do with the story, though its pretty fun in arcade mode as well. Its a great game to have Steam Workshop support for, which already has produced some interesting and fun mods.			"

								This game is really fun when playing with other people. The 'Adventure Mode' is pretty short, and after completing that, I felt no reason to keep playing by myself. However, if you have some friends who are willing to take on the learning curve of this game, this game can be pretty great, especially with the Workshop support.Also, the fact that they added VR is fantastic. Playing it makes me want to vomit from motion sickness, but it's still pretty cool.			"

								I've been following this game since they started the kickstarter a while back, which is actually the first and only game I've helped kickstart. I've played from the alpha stage up to now, and the game has shown significant progress. I know a lot of people are hesitant to purchase early access games, but trust me, Refract absolutely know what they are doing with Distance. They have been putting out consistent updates and improvements to the alpha and beta stages over the past year or two, and it is easy to tell that they are very passionate about this game. They also are very supportive of the community, evidenced by the fact they acknowledge and support the user created levels in the workshop. If I hadn't helped kickstarted this game, I would definitely purchase early access. I really trust Refract with creating a quality game, and I can tell you with certainty that this won't be an early access game that crashes and burns like a lot of others out there.Also, if you're not sure you like arcade racing games like this, you should download Nitronic Rush, which Distance is the sequel to.  It has very similar mechanics, an awesome soundtrack, and is free! Go try it out!			"

The car damage as you go through lasers and saw blades is quite entertaining, and the game is fast enough where you need to be on your toes at any given moment on the track. While the price is a bit high for my liking, the game is solid even in its early stages.			"

								Took a gamble on this, being that it's early access, but I was absolutely blown away by how complete the game felt.[Gameplay]+Hyper-fast racing, very similar to Track Mania with San Francisco Rush: 2049 mixed in+Tons of different track options. You could be driving one second, flying the next, then flipping sideways to wall ride+You will die often, and the spawn system is quick enough to keep you from getting bored+These tracks can be very challenging, so you will feel a real sense of accomplishment once you've survived them[PC Options]+This is clearly a PC game, with full blown graphics settings options, high framerate, and controller support too+Custom tracks galore, there are tons already and the game isn't even released yet-No mouse input at menus as I write this, but it's obvious this is a feature that is intended to be there[Style]+Hot damn, it's like tron blew a load in your face+Impressive visuals, actually manages to make me say ""wow""+Soundtrack is excellent, it really fits the game perfectly and makes every track feel intenseI really have nothing negative to say so far. If you like racing and you like crazy Tron/flying cars this game is excellent.			"

								Note: this game is early access, so don't expect a FULL game.Personally, it reminds me of the classic Wipeout games, so I really love it!

Did I mention anything about gravity?- Fast action! No thinking twice, be prepared or smash your face on that wall!- Level editor! Potentially infinite maps!What it lacks:- More cars- More multiplayer gamemodes- Power-ups, weapons and more stuff for better arcade and multiplayer- Decent SFX, for now the game seems just too quietOverall, great game, and I'm sure they will add a good part of what I think it lacks!

								I've kept my eye on this game ever since the alpha. Now that I finally played the game, I can talk about this game. First off, I commend the devs for making this game beautiful and easy to run. The graphics are cell-shaded, which threw me off at first, but it made this game much more special to me. The steering is very tight and I never has any instances where I hit the outer wall when making a sharp turn even when boosted. The boosting feels so nice, the thrill of continuously passing through the green rings to keep your boost up is very exhilarating. The controls are very tight and responsive. The tracks are varied and they never feel dull. Flying is fun as hell. The music is stellar. The fact that more tracks are made every day by the community is very intuitive. You'll never be bored with this game. I love this game. Get this game. You won't regret it.			"

The sense that you are always progressing and improving your game is far better to me than the techincal jargon many other racing games are all too familiar with. There is also a sense of hidden lore (note that I haven't completed the campaign mode yet) because of the aspect of driving alone in this highly futuristic city. There are certainly some secrets hidden away in the plot for this game. It is also challenging enough to keep me on edge and the custom soundtrack feature is very cool if you have a specific taste in music in your games			"

								Couple of reasons why to get Distance:a) You've played Nitronic Rush and you loved it.b) Point a) is true for you, but even after you have finished all the Hardcore tracks you have seen a potential for level design that goes even deeper than any of the tracks in Hardcore went.c) You would've payed for Nitronic Rush if it costed money.d) It's already unbelievably satisfying and the Early Access tag say more that there is more stuff coming rather than it does not work so buyers beware. This game is already more enjoyable and feature-rich than most full games. This is probably one of the most shining examples how to do it right.e) Steam Workshop is loaded to brim with custom maps.f) Story is kinda irrelevant so you do not have to be afraid that the unfinished Adventure mode would hurt your experience.

								Couldn't care less about Tron as I never experienced the golden side of it (Not to take away from those who do love it though), so that side does not contribute to my love of this game.Anyway, onto the review. I've only played for a short time but I can see this becoming one of my favourite racing games. The flight adds such strategy to overtaking, making you have to watch the road for obstacles, and the sky for rivals.You have to time jump, direct flight, dodge lasers, jump from road to road. Plus a great boost system of cool down by passing through gates instead of having to earn it on the go.Can't wait to play a local game with friends and watch the ensuing chaos			"

								At first, I thought the controls and mechanics would be mediocre at best, but other reviewers have said that they are very well done. And they're quite right! This game is awesome, their ideas are awesome, and the artwork is awesome. If you like racing games at all, but you want more of a challenge, then this is a great game for your collection!			"

								I would definitely recommend Distance to anyone who's looking for something different.First, some history: Distance was funded on Kickstarter in 2012. The team consists of many if the developers who worked on the game Nitronic Rush. Enough history.Distance doesn't truly fall into any one category, with its multitude of game modes, and openness to really just do whatever you want in any mode. With the level editor, you can create the race track of your dreams or make a playground for some high-octane parkour.And no matter what you decide to do in Distance, you'll be doing it to a bad♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack.Here's some videos from my channel:

Early Access Review
								I bought this game very early and was acutally quiet happy with it. The graphics were astonishing.there were a few intense and awesome maps and a creative Community so we could use  the workshop. I saw the latest update and started to play it again and saw all those changes. To ability to put in your own music, the boombox mode which turns your car and the world around you in a music synchronicing beatvisualizer, the option to customize the car a little bit , the little detail like the star screen on your car when you are staying at the same spot for a short time... i love all of these ! I realy love such details and i am very very happy that you can see that this game is still evolving, i swear, this is gonna be one hell of a game when it is finished.But the best thing about this new update is the Trackmogrify mode. You just type in some random words, number , sentences , whatever you want...and the game creates a racetrack. Type in stuff like ""rainbow road"" and fell free to have a nice journey on a colourful , rainbowcolored track... type in ""lightning storm"" to get yourself into an intense storm full of lightningstrikes. This mode got rid of a big problem Distance had. After a while you had yourself through all levels and there wasnt much to do. This new mode gives you an incredible, endless amount of new tracks you can generate in less than a few seconds and can be quiet funny. Now Distance isnt just a good game anymore. It turned into a very good game, full of potential. If the designers behind this gem are still updating it in the future and bring even more content out this game will be on my top games of all time, it has so much potential and i can see that the creators have some neat ideas and i am excited for the future.Graphic: 10/10 , very beatiful and uniqueGameplay : 8.5/10 , unique and awesome gameplay, but i feel like there is potential for more and different modes, the new Trackmogrify mode is a good start!Sound: 10/10 , nice futuristic sounds, clear and good quality Music: 9/10 , very fitting, has a electronic style and sums up the level you are playing but not much variety of soundtracks BUT you can bring your own music into the game now which is absolutly awesome. The game even responds to your music in very different ways , like visualizers.Variety: 8/10 , thanks to the new gamemode , the workshop and some implemented level you have a nice variety of different tracks, but i have the feeling the game could use some more ""Items"" to put into the world. New traps or stuff like that ;)Story: 4/10 , the game has a short adventure mode but its more like a longer tutorial. There are some interesting scenes , levels and more in it but there isnt realy a good or long story, but this game doesnt realy need one, because it isnt a game which is designed for an overwhelming story but for the pure amount of fun you can have whilst playing it.

								A classic in the making. Distance seems to meld the twitchy perfection of racers like Trackmania (with an even more intuitive map builder) with the classic, hyperactive rush of old school arcade racers. If you yearn for the days of Wipeout, POD, MegaRace, and STUN Runner, this is a ticket back to those wild, futuristic flight racers.			"

								Amazing mix of car driving, jumping, gliding, boosting, rotating, wallriding, blade and laser dodging, great, electro music and even randomly generated tracks. I don't know how else can I describe this game. If you're either a fan of trackmania, futuristic cars, arcade racing games or just wanna see something that is almost completely new and may just blow your mind away, then you must buy it. This game is in beta stage of development, and except maybe just a little lack of official levels (there are lots of community levels already and seed-generated levels as well), it just feels like a complete product. Oh, and you can add custom music to it, and let some levels flash into beat of it as well. Fancy.			"

								One of the very few great examples of an early access game. Where do I even begin with this review...Gameplay, It's phenomenal. Driving the car feels extremely smooth, and doing tricks to dodge the obstacles is great. Playing the game on adventure mode presents all commands slowly enough to learn things on the go, while each track gets more insanely twisted as the game progresses (currently unfinished as of the time of this review). If you want more challenge, go for the arcade mode, and race against the time to get yourself on the global rankings.Music and graphics, also great. It's an athmospheric futuristc setting full of neon and style, that will keep you pumped for action all the way. The lights also even blink along with the beat of the upbeat techno music.Content, although the adventure mode is still unfinished and isn't intended to be too long, there's still a bunch of gamemodes for both single player, local and online multiplayer, and of course the level editor and the workshop tracks. Don't be afraid of getting many custom tracks, they don't use that much disk space.Overall, this game's amazing, and its future is very promising. It's an example of early access done right, a finely crafted experience that shows early access CAN work.			"

								This game... is REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD. You ever see those crazy japanese kids who play DDR on the keyboard at speeds faster than light? Well, this is a game like that... but for racing. It's easy to learn, but hard as hell to master. This game is on the way for my GOTY of 2016, and I will update this review on January 1, 2017 (or sometime after) if it comes to be so.GOTY:This game has a lot going for it. It really does. This was the most fun game I played on Steam, and I mean THE MOST FUN OUT OF ANY GAME ON STEAM that I played in 2016. My 2016 GOTY award goes to this game. For being absolutely the most fun I've had in a while. The community is awesome, the tracks are off the walls great, and everyone playing is just looking to have a fun time.			"

								Early Access game that will probably never leave early access. Still a really ♥♥♥♥ing fun game to play while high as ♥♥♥♥. You can sink tons of time into this game if you are willing to learn the mechanics. Verdict: Buy if on sale or if you can't help yourself. Pros: -Good soundtrack-Boombox setting and custom music allows you to jam out to your favorite edm and go super saiyan-Excellent car handling-Litterally too much good tracks to race on-Unique as ♥♥♥♥-Excellent split screen game to play with the buddies-rewarding-4 different views-VR-Multiple Gamemodes-dat atmosphere-different angle on racing games (litteraly)Cons: -In online multiplayer you cant run into other cars but in co-op you can-Handing while in mid air or flying feels wonky unless in first person view-wonky camera positioning If you turn around too fast-No dedicated multiplayer servers/matchmaking-Not really a racing game more of a trick/parkour game. ( This might not be a con to some people)-No car variety; litterally just one car-No 'progression', the only progression is just becoming a better driver-Hard to tell which direction is up and which is down which isnt a problem because the car can ride on walls but if you hop off the walls gravity kicks in and it becomes a problem. -Highscores on most maps are from people finding unintended exploits/skips in a map.I think the only thing this game NEEDS is dedicated servers/matchmaking for playing online with strangers. But I would also really like to see more car variety/aesthetics just to spice things up.			"

								I spent 4 hours on this game so far (I'm on mobile, so steam cloud isn't showing hours played), and I find it really enjoyable. The story mode acclimates you to the gameplay really well. Just a warning, the adventure mode is short, and they let you know that, and also, since it's early access, it cuts you out very abruptly lol. It scared me that something was wrong, but it is a new game. I read reviews of an extraordinary community, but when I went online, I didn't see many people. This may have just been my timing. Overall, this game shows great promise in integrity and growth. A note to the devs might be making the level editor more user friendly or elaborate more on how to do everything, or just point out where the instructions are better. Thanks! Great game so far!			"

								The only reason I haven't played this game a ton is because it wasn't what I expected. The dark themes, the kinda awkward display, the crazy things happening everywhere; that was not what Nitronic Rush was about. But, as I played, I started to accept Distance for what it was: a masterpiece (that still needs a little work, but that's what Early Access is for).The music is amazing. Like I said, darker than the prequel, but amazing. The first song I heard started of beautiful. Then, it got even better, introducing me to the real soundtrack. I was amazed. I don't even know if there's any way to get the soundtrack, but I want it.The graphics are good. I don't care much about graphics, but in the artistic sense, not necessarily the quality sense, the graphics are better than most. They are able to set the mood so well, and make me feel whatever they want.I haven't even played multiplayer, so I can't comment on it. But the thing is, you don't really need to to get your money's worth. There are a fair amount of levels, and beating them doesn't mean you're done. I've spent hours slowly getting better at Nitronic Rush's measly six levels, and I'm not afraid to admit that I still am. I know, from what I've seen, that I will have the same experience. But wait, there's more! There are a crazy amount of custom levels to get, and I only have a couple, but that's got to keep you entertained! But it doesn't stop there! Trackmogrify offers a track to match your specific search terms, for more crazy fun! Now maybe we're over-glorifying it a bit. It's not a perfect tool, and the levels are never as unique as the community ones, but I still think I could use it a lot.Now let's talk about gameplay. This game can make me rage a bit, but not too much. Mostly it's just super cool and thrilling and sometimes a bit scary. I'm serious, I could compare this to a rollercoater, but I'm not good at analogies. Who gets tired of doing tricks on a cool car in a crazy neon area? Who gets bored while constantly dodging sawblades at hundreds of miles per hour? Not anybody I'd reccomend this game to.We've talked about music, graphics, replayability, and gameplay. I don't know what else there is, but ten out of ten already. Wait, you say you're still improving on it? Well, I wouldn't know what to say if it got any better than this.			"

								This game is amazing. I am not normally one to enjoy racing games much, but this one is different. First off: Thank you developer for the 21:9 aspect ratio support. It honestly does mean a lot. Now let me say that thge visuals in this game are stunning. Even though it may not have the most technically advanced graphics in the world, it is one of the best looking games I have seen. The gameplay is also very fun, and when I first started I thought this game was going to be really easy, but I was wrong. The game quickly introduces more mechanics to the game that add to the complexity, keeping every level fresh and fun. Overall, it is a great game, and the fact that even two years after launch it is still revieving updates makes this a definite recommend on my part.			"

								This game does a lot of things right. If you like ""arcade"" style driving games that are very responsive (albeit not very realistic) like the Burnout series over say, something like Forza, you'll like this game. It's fast, it's responsive, you don't spend your entire time against the walls and it's generally pretty fun.Graphics are pretty smoothe and visually appealilng, although a bit too ""dark"" for my tastes.Overall, it's a solid driving game and the flying/jumping adds a really fun aspect to the game. But where this game loses the appeal for me is: it just doesn't make me want to play it. There aren't a lot in the way of goals, or trying to master the levels, or things like that. The levels are also uninspiring from each other, they're all pretty much the same thing.It's one of the best driving games I've ever not wanted to play... if that makes any sense.I'm still going to recommend it because they did one thing right that a lot of games don't, and that's the actual racing. It's solid. Maybe make up your own goals and you'll be fine.			"

								This is my favorite VR racing game available.After playing Nitronic Rush (the game's free predecessor) I was immediately sold on this idea and how polished and fun it was from the get go. When Distance kickstarter went up I  immediately paid for alpha access. The alpha was impressive from the start and the game has been continuely updated literally every few days/weeks with not just fixes but new content. I haven't even looked at much of the workshop content yet, but what I have played is amazing. I have played the game with my Oculus rift, and it ""just works"", literally one of my favorite VR experiences.I haven't played such a fun""crazy"" scifi racing game since F-Zero GX, and Distance trumps it.

Might be something to do with the game not bringing all the resources it needs into ram and then looking at the slower ssd for the resources, just a guess.			"

								Distance, the sequel to the great game known as Nitronic Rush. You are are a car in a system, getting from one point to the other.  A very simple concept, but the way it was executed in Distance is simply beautiful. The main point I wish to address in this is that the car can be sliced in various different ways from the dangerous lazers found along the tracks, and you can keep going, even with just two wheels! Even the concept of the car flying is invluded in this game, which adds to the overall experience of the game, making is definitely worthwhile.Though the game is not very large, it is a ton of fun and has the inclusion of steam workshop, which adds to the entire fun of the game, constantly giving you more things to do, and explore and make your own tracks to enjoy with.There isn't much else to mention, the music in the game was fitting, but nothing to be really worth mentioning. The gameplay is smooth, graphics are good, and the variety is great.To me, this game is definitely worth getting, even if it isn't on sale. It is worth the money.			"

								As A kid, I used to watch, a LOT of the old Hotwheels cartoons, and I think that this game (And it's predecessor, Nitronic Rush, which you should definately play before buying this, which you should also do) captures the air of those shows perfectally. It isn't like your normal racing game, of course, you do have a track... because no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherelock, ya gotta drive on something, but the track isn't empty. It isn't a cart racing game either, as there are no weapons except for smashing your opponents into obstacles. What makes this game ""survival racing"" is the fact that the obstacles don't merely make you ""crash"" (which they can do if you hit them at light speed), they can chip away at your vehicle as well. If you cruze through a vertical laser, you're gonna get cut in half. Of course, you can still drive this way, but it isn't exactly a comfortable way to drive, as you've lost all of your previous control. NOW TO THE PROS AND CONSPROS:1. Getting cut up instead of insta death2. Flight, it adds a different dimension to racing3. It tends to run well, and if you're having trouble, just mess around with the settings, and it'll still look beautiful with lower quality graphics.4. THE COMMUNITY TRACKS! Some of them are outstanding, and really fun to mess around in, and the community for this game is amazing. 5. CAR CUSTOMIZATION! Stand out from the croud with your garish Pink and lime green car.CONS:1. The car is a bit, floaty sometimes... maybe a drift mechanic is in order.2. Going quickly can feel a bit... slow, IDK why, but... maybe that's just me. 3. MORE DEV MADE TRACKS PLEASE! The custom bits in them are uniquely awesome.ALL IN ALLYou should get this game. Scroll back up. And hit that button. NOW!  "

Overall, if this game recieved more support, it could grow into a respectable game.But for now, it's subpar due to it's lack of content.			"

Early Access Review
								To start off with a caveat: I NEVER play racing games, except maybe Mario Kart, so my opinion is not the most nuanced on the topic. That said, to me, Distance is a fabulous and inventive game. The movement mechanics of the car are actually suprisingly intuitive after the first few times that you use them, and these enable really cool tracks. Seriously, the tracks in this game are tons of fun to race on, even if you die a lot. And that's another thing: dying. Dying is quick and easy and can be self-triggered if you find yourself in a bad situation. I don't know how common that is in racing games, but it was quick enough that it didn't kill the pacing as long as I didn't screw the pooch on driving too hard. You'll lose SOME time, obviously, but it still feels really quick and easy.At this point, the story is barely developed, but that's not a huge problem. The game tends to tell its story through the environments anyway, and it's amazing to me how well it manages to convey unease or awe through the use of music, noises, and visual effects. Getting new tracks off Steam workshop is really quick and easy as well; you can even do it from the Steam browser in-game, the game will check for new levels, and you can play pretty much instantly.If there's any complaint I could make about the game, it's that the developer's levels (the official levels) are a bit too easy overall, and there's not that many of them. To get a real challenge I had to look to the Steam levels, but the community is really pretty good, so you can find a lot of difficult and inventive levels on the Workshop.So, in short, if you like racing games, I would say Distance is good value right now even in its unfinished state; it's a barrel of fun and provides enough content (by way of the Steam Workshop) to keep you entertained for hours.

The stunning visuals and soundtrack mixed smoothly with the responsive and tight controls make for a visceral gameplay experience unlike any other available on the market as of right now. Sure, it's in Early Access, but there are many times where I have forgotten that entirely due to its polish and attention to detail.Backing everything up is a stream of user created content and an in depth level editor at the disposal of all those who take the time to learn it.The only downside is the performance drops in very heavy scenes even with a high-end machine.

								An incredibly fast paced and well done early access game. The graphics are smooth and the tracks are all well designed, if a bit sparse. This is a bit expected in an early access game and the workshop more than makes up for it. It's a true sequel to Nitronic Rush and it really lives up to one of my favorite games of all time.Though, I really hope they offer back the system which allowed you to orient yourself using the right-analog stick, because the recently added system of holding X to push yourself against the track has broken some of the older tracks rhythm. Soundtrack is still as great as ever and I hope for a future mod or addon to add in the announcer from Nitronic Rush or something of the same kind.			"

								So far, I have only played the single player, but the game itself is quite good. There is a lot of the feeling of speed you get from other high speed racing games. I really like the addition of the wings which allow short flight. In a game that is difficult and requires highly precise manipulation of the vehicle, this is a godsend. However, the game is still quite difficult to keep up the challenge. As of the last time I played, the story mode is not yet complete, but it is still longer than I thought it would be in Early Access. There is also still a lot of community content that I have not played yet, but look forward to playing soon.Playthrough and first look at the story Mode:

								Distance is what you would get if TRON and F-Zero had a baby. The game is a joy to play; which is something a lot of modern games seem to lack. The Steam Workshop integration and the in-game level editor and online modes will no doubt put an end to all that pesky free-time I had...			"

								If it weren't for the warning after the initial loading screen and the watermark in the top right corner of the window, I'd completely forget this game isn't finished. Even though the campaign isn't complete, there are enough community levels to keep you busy for quite a while. Some are really challenging while others make you feel like some kinda car-ninja... Everything about this game is pretty solid so far and if they quit development tomorrow I'd still recommend it.			"

								Awesomely intense VR rush!Picked this up today had a blast racing with a friend, cool level design great aesthetic style and tight control handling. The extra controls at first didn't sound appealing to me but the way they design the tracks around the jumping, flying and rotating it works really well and I enjoyed that too!Highly recommend if you are looking for an intense racing game to play with a friend or solo in VR.

								This game is awesome and it really makes fun. With thousends of tracks in the workshop you wont get tired.  In the evening you often will find some people in Multiplayer, and if not than you can make one yourself. And  often someone will join your instance ( in the evenings). The game will download the needed workshopmaps automatical.                       If you dont know if this is for you, try out  NITRONIC RUSH                Nitronic Rush is theit first game, and you can  download it from their Website. I also tried Nitronic Rush and it convinced me to buy Distance. Try it and buy it  you wont regret it "

								I've bought it, i've installed it, I've played it a bit. It was nice and fun. Good music. The controls are easy enough, at least in the beginning. The became gradually more and more complex up to the point of confusion of what to do at all.I liked what I saw, so:  recommended!Since I was in the mood for some casual fun, I had to stop playing :) Never tried it again.So, if you have time to learn complex controls and enjoy fast racing and moody music, this game might be for you. If you just wanna play this game an hour every two weeks, you should probably look somewhere else :)I kinda was a bit reminded of DeathKarz, still my absolute favorite racing game on PC ^^ "

								This review can be found with additional links here: http://theikim.com/the-good-the-fad-and-the-ugly-distance/Saw blades, large cylindrical grinders, Pumpkins and Lasers. These may sound like standard sci-fi and horror film props, but would you be surprised to find them in a racing title?One that pits you against the hazards of the track in addition to the traditional clock. There are no laps, nor items. It’s you, and the track. The aforementioned hazards are all standard obstacles that will stand in your way, minus Pumpkins. They’re ready to slice, dice and completely destroy your car. However, you have the advantage of a rocket-boosting-self-repairing car. That last part can only be done at specific Checkpoint/regeneration rings however. As long as you have at least one wheel you can keep going. So, yes, driving half of a car (or even less) is a mechanic in this.Did I mention this car has the ability to jump, and take flight as well?The controls are simple and easy to grasp. Although, I can say from experience that Rocket League did somewhat mess me up. The Boost option is normally where Jump would be. Although remapping the controls is easy.The HUD is, rather cleverly, displayed on the back of the car itself. Every now and then a trick notification will show up, but this is only for a moment. Boost and flight are tied together. The engine can, and will overheat if left to run for too long. Pulling off tricks, or going through rings will cool down your engine, keeping you from exploding.In terms of the car itself, it handles incredibly well. Not just on the track, but in the air. This thing may as well be a spacecraft. With not just a rocket motor on the back, but rotational thrusters as well. They’re not just for show though. The road at some points may quite literally flip out.If you weren’t already sold on this car, its colors can be customized as well.As seen above, the game itself is set within a rather mysterious floating city. There’s really no sign of human life other than large propaganda-esque signs reading things “Salvation in Science” or “Together We Progress.”Without giving away too much, whatever it was that caused everyone to leave appears to still be out there. One of the first things noted is that an “Anomaly” had been detected in Sector 11.It’s your job to find it.You’ll be travelling through a world with design inspiration from things like TRON. If the Wipeout games sound familiar, this visual and musical style should be of no surprise. It’s electronic, but not harsh dubstep. It’s more in the ballpark of the Rocket League soundtrack. The world will also illuminate and pulsate according to the music. All music is also able to be replaced with custom tracks.So, I could be barrelling down a course to F-Zero’s Mute City theme.Currently the Adventure mode mentioned with the vague plotline above is incomplete. However, an extremely robust Level Editor and Automatic generator both exist to allow for completely new races. The community has created some excellent levels. Some are obviously better than others, but in my experience one has to work in order to find the more iffy levels.There are also a few other additional modes. A One-Life run through a small course, a “Reverse Tag” that acts like keep-away and finally, Soccer. So, Rocket League without Boost and flips if you will. These are fun little additions, but they are just that. Additions.Although, if you search “Horror Racing Game” an article about this game is the first result. The developers have noted that they do intend for it to be somewhat frightening. Now, I’m no fan of the horror genre, unless you consider the Ghostbuster-esque title Luigi’s Mansion a horror game. Either way I’m oddly excited for this.In terms of non-horror Spooky things, the sole achievement available for this game is called “Pumpkin King.” You have to smash every pumpkin on the Spooky Town Reverse Tag Map.In its current state, Distance has a heavy focus on gameplay, rather than plotline. Because of this the rating itself will be given on the core gameplay and visual/audio design rather than level structure or plot.Distance earns a Good rating, with a score of 9/10. Easy to grasp gameplay along with a great visual and audio style lead to something I desperately want to see brought to Arcades. The sole reason I can’t give this a full 10 is due to it currently being in beta. PS: Distance is the spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush. A free student-made game that set the foundation for this title. Some of the original developers are currently working on Distance as well!			"

Also, fans of the Speed Racer series and the Hotwheels Acceleracers series can blindly go for this game. The essence of those movies is brilliantly captured by this game, trust me, nothing else comes even close.

Krispy Picks [Sprint] 

By: Krispy

			Krispy Picks With early access available, it seems that finding those awesome gems in between all of the questionable level design is getting rather hard.		


 (Collection Credit - Krispy)UPDATE: For those who dig map-making (track-making), I gotta say that the Level Editor of this game is just fantastic. It's incredibly intuitive, powerful and well optimized as well...truly feels like a professional standalone program (except minor issues here and there). I feel the full price is warranted just for the Level Editor itself, leave alone the rest of the game.WARNING - Do NOT judge this game by it's campaign (Adventure mode), it really sucks hard, especially if you come from the predecessor Nitronic Rush. First one hour of the game had me thinkin' it was garbage, I was hangin' on just because it was from the Nitronic Team. Really glad I hung on though, as Community Levels are where it's really at, so many of them are like...Holy Toledo! The campaign is apparently being overhauled, but it aint really worth it at the moment.Thanks for reading,Sel.*Updated Jan 24, 2017*			"

								The prototype was just splendid, and the real deal is very worth it. I love that this game does so many new things for a racing game, or at least things that you don't usually see together: hazards that can slice dynamic portions off your car, wallriding, ceilingriding, seamless manual transition from car to plane mode, right-stick-controlled manual rotation for midair orientation and tricks, a level with some pretty legit horror elements, well executed Tron aesthetic, track editor with workshop support, random track generation, and a friggin' JUMP BUTTON.It would take far too long to extoll the virtues of everything I think this game does awesomely, so instead I'll list my peeves: there's a relatively meager list of preassembled tracks insofar, the randomly generated tracks (while pretty dang neat) are way too short, and the process of jumping and rotating to cling to a wall where the track abruptly ends is a bit more awkward than it should be.A laser sheared my front wheels off and I drove my sparking front half to the next checkpoint to repair and keep going. 10/10 would inflict self-harm with lasers again.

								If you are into arcade racing, speed runner games or even endless runners, then you will enjoy this game. At the time of review (6/17/15) I finished the story mode in 49  minutes of playtime (though that includes tinkering with the settings), but there is much more on offer here, and the campaign is supposedly going to get longer. There are a bunch of customs maps to keep you entertained until then.As for how the game runs, I maintained a constant 60 fps @ 1080p with max settings on my gtx 780 and I5 4670k (at 3.6 GHz.) There are a ton of graphics options avaiable to tweak the game to  your likings and overall this is a good purchase even in early access.			"

								This is my honest review for this game: Distance.But, first, I would like to address the fact that I was speaking with my mates, talking about how the video games industry has turned into a violent bloodbath-rehash of Call Of Duty's and the likes that are developed by the so-called ""AAA""  games industry. leaders.From time to time I reach to a point where I'm speaking to a friend or stranger regarding the state of the Games industry as a whole.  where upon he/she explains that the ""AAA"" developers are all developing video games only tried and tested so that they don't perform anything risky.Ergo, I reply with disgust, stating that such manner of thinking provides no creativity when one is developing art.I'd argue that developing creative games that is artistic as it is practical IS how you would make money; you wouldn't lose money when you bring creativity to the masses.Which brings this game to my attention.This game is what every ""AAA"" Developers and Big studios lack - Creativity - Gameplay - Content - Fun.Concordantly, when a sigle or 5 man developers creates something this brilliant and unique, where big time million dollar studios-of-copy-and-paste lack. You know that in reality, it's the indy developers that are going to move this industry.It's a shame for such a brilliant game like this to not have at least half of fame of what the generic bloodbath COD and, Battlefields and, WAR WAR WAR games have to offer, complete with ZERO innovation. The same goes with racing sims. Though this isn't a racing sim. It's a Game. Something big ""AAA"" companies fail to grasp.If this game had some Advertisment campaigns all over the net, it sure is going to generate hype.A video game from the roots of creative imagination, from the roots that we all hold true and dear to have fun with. Something this awesome deserves more praise and more hype with people playing it than the ruined ""Games"" of today. Riddled with ""DLC."" Riddled with violent bloodbath adjacent to murder and carnage, and of course, deemed ""acceptable by today's standards.""But this Gem, this is a video game. sure it has action and some violent ones at that. But there's no Blood splatting all over the place, there's no Russia vs America here.This is a video game. The action we are all looking for from the folly big names ""AAA"" studios........Creativity doesn't come from ""avoiding risks"", creativity comes from freedom of imagination. And this game is nurtured plenty from the mind who created it.			"

								Haven't played a ton yet, but I love it already! Sometimes timing the flips to switch roads can be a little tricky at first, but you get used to it. Also, the community map maker kind of terrifies me because it's really complicated for me (never designed any video game worlds or anything, so it's like looking at a map in a foreign language to me), so I love all the people who know what they're doing and making those great community maps for people like me to play! Can't wait til this game is fully released!			"

								The prototype was just splendid, and the real deal is very worth it. I love that this game does so many new things for a racing game, or at least things that you don't usually see together: hazards that can slice dynamic portions off your car, wallriding, ceilingriding, seamless manual transition from car to plane mode, right-stick-controlled manual rotation for midair orientation and tricks, a level with some pretty legit horror elements, well executed Tron aesthetic, track editor with workshop support, random track generation, and a friggin' JUMP BUTTON.It would take far too long to extoll the virtues of everything I think this game does awesomely, so instead I'll list my peeves: there's a relatively meager list of preassembled tracks insofar, the randomly generated tracks (while pretty dang neat) are way too short, and the process of jumping and rotating to cling to a wall where the track abruptly ends is a bit more awkward than it should be.A laser sheared my front wheels off and I drove my sparking front half to the next checkpoint to repair and keep going. 10/10 would inflict self-harm with lasers again.

								If you are into arcade racing, speed runner games or even endless runners, then you will enjoy this game. At the time of review (6/17/15) I finished the story mode in 49  minutes of playtime (though that includes tinkering with the settings), but there is much more on offer here, and the campaign is supposedly going to get longer. There are a bunch of customs maps to keep you entertained until then.As for how the game runs, I maintained a constant 60 fps @ 1080p with max settings on my gtx 780 and I5 4670k (at 3.6 GHz.) There are a ton of graphics options avaiable to tweak the game to  your likings and overall this is a good purchase even in early access.			"

There are no cons, except for that this game is in early access beta.  I can't wait for the full release.  As for the pros, this game plays and feels beautiful.  The soundtrack that goes with each level is phenomenal.  I have experienced nothing but smooth gameplay right from the beginning and I find that the further I get into the adventure mode, the more I want to play.  The tutorials are done right and you can tell that the developers have put alot of time and love into this game.  Kudos to the developers.  Buy This Game Now!			"

								Good and frustrating (not in a good way) now isn't that statement confusing?The driving physics are great.The levels are great. The car is great. The fact that VR with this game would be awesome (The car is basically built with VR in mind mostly glass with even a glass panel in the floor when you're in first person) But the fact that the top 50 scores are always insane level cuts where they jump 99% of the track going straight to the end is kinda frustrating. I have top 100 lap scores on almost every track I raced (which means almost every track in the game including some challenge tracks) and I still don't like it. I want to see people cutting apex's on turns shaving off 0.1 seconds in a lap to beat a world record not flinging themselves across the map in some insane stunt to get 3 minutes off a lap time. I understand the idea of it, it's about getting it done ASAP but that doesn't make it any less annoying. I'm not saying these lap times should be discredited, as they are extremely difficult to pull off. But I am saying I wish they weren't possible to pull of.			"

								I never write reviews for games like honestly this is my first because this game is so good. I played Nitronic Rush (the very first version of this game) for COUNTLESS hours and Distance is very similar but with more features like online play, sexy graphics and other stuff. Lemme tell you though, this game is such an awesome experience like just the rush you get when you play the game is insane man. It's like riding a roller coaster... in space... in a black hole. That's the only way to describe it.When you start this game off it's like ""whoa dudebro this is cool I can go fast"" and then it steadily shows you some more things you can do with your car and you're all like ""I like this."" and then it gets a little scary and you're like ""ok what's going on"" and then all of the sudden you're racing through this city and things are happening around you and the track is trying to kill you and you don't want to slow down because the adrenaline in your body has been keeping you on the edge of your booster seat for the past few tracks until you get good at all the moves and you end up beating the game.Honestly one of the best games.

								Distance the first game to ever have wings on a car for a decent reason. So for one I am loving this game to bits so far. Its got a learning curve but its not too nasty and its FAST!. So far the game shows real promise as a early access games. Tons of graphics options, Customisation of vehicles, Steam workshop on day 1 for new tracks, leaderboards ect. But the thing i the love the most about this game so far is that its like a survival game mixed with burnout  with tron as the theme and you wont get the full idea till you watch one of the trailers. Fly off the track, fly back on with your power. Get cut in half!, get to the next checkpoint to regenerate. Multiplayer is good fun too and seems easy to set up and to connect. so yeah so far I ******** love it! Grab it if you have a racing itch cause its brilliant. I was looking for a game to replace the long dead blur and its not quite the same but I dont care one bit. I like this one more!			"

								A promising racing game that goes outside the box and offers an experience to contrast the saturation of real-life simulation racers. Combined with a sleek Tron-like art style, creative tracks and mechanics (plus with the ability to choose custom music tracks) makes this a great game to recommend to those bored of realistic racers.

								I've been playing for less than an hour -yet- but this game has already won me. It is SO awesome, such an excellent idea. Racing on neon environments trying not to crash on any wall or trap, performing complex manouvers, and with such music. It might still be on Early Access, but it already feels so great... Can't recommend it enough.			"

								Nitronic Rush, the last title by this group, was an unbelievable physics racer. Distance only improves on the formula.Gone are the spin-outs and shifting of traditional racing games, replaced with sweet jumps, dextrous wall-hopping, and incredibly fast-paced speed. Everything I hate about racing games is gone, replaced by a style of driving that can only be described as vehicular parkour.Distance is a truly three-dimensional racer that's quick to pick up, but incredibly challenging to perfect. I hate racing games. I love Distance. Not sure if you want it? Nitronic Rush is free, and feels very much like an extended demo for Distance.(Your real value on purchase is access to all of the tracks off the Steam Workshop—Refract has given track-builders some very powerful tools for track creation, and the community has made some really excellent pieces of work)			"

								Racing, tricks, survival... i dont even know how to describe this game...You get this sick looking car, looks similar to a tron-mustang, and you get put on this epic track with wall-riding, driving on the cieling, loop-the-loops, jumps, even flying over large gaps, and your goal is to get to the end as quick as possible; but on top of that lets throw in some lasers and saw blades cutting your car into pieces. a turbo-boost system that nearly doubles your top speed, and tubes with spikes spinning everywhere that will either blow you up or send you flying off somewhereThis game is absolutely insane, but it does require a decent computer, especially in the tracks with more lasers/saws/spikes/etc (Though if you still want to play a game, there is a dumbed-down version called Nitronic Rush, same developers, nearly-identical game, but can run on an easy-bake oven)GET THIS GAME PEOPLE, NO REGRETS!!!

								A beautiful combination of Rocket League and Mario Kart, the level editor is very extensive, and it is easy to make levels properly, due to the various tools the developers have added for convenience. The online mode is great, very fast-paced and frantic, whether you like a challenge or not, this game has whatever difficulty you please. So far, the community is quite small, making it all the more better, plus a few individuals took it upon themselves to further improve the experience by tweaking the amount of allowed players. Overall a nice little alternative to any realistic racing game.			"

								I bought this game because I was a huge fan of the DreamCast version of San Francisco Rush (2049).  I'm digging the concept thus far, but am kind of bummed on some of the supposed, what the community calls, ""skips.""  Yeah, yeah...I've read the arguments for them, and I don't completely disagree with the reasoning.  I get it - you're supposed to be able to explore a bit, climb buildings, etc. But when it defeats the purpose of having the tracks in the first place, then something needs to be done with the levels to make the tracks mean something.  I'm not suggesting getting rid of the abilities of the vehicle, but merely for the ""official"" tracks to be better designed so that everybody is not racing on who can skip the most.  A possible solution would be to make certain checkpoints required, and to map additional required checkpoints onto already known ""skips,"" thus making them more of a ""shortcut"" that happens to raise the difficulty level to shave off some seconds.  That's my opinion, anyway. Furthermore, I very much miss the couch sessions I would have in College playing 4 player battle mode on Rush.  I realize this probably isn't in the plans, but it would be hella cool if this game had something like it.Overall, for the discounted price of $10, I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. Hopefully the finished product might address what I consider an issue, but it seems like the ""community"" has already spoken.  I still prefer Rush, but then again, I paid $50 for it when it came out, so this is well worth it.			"

								One of the best Racing games of this generation, It's like and extreme version of hot wheels with an emphasis on skill and surviving the track. If you get anything from this review take these first 2 paragraphs into account. The game is absolutely insane, never in game have i had so many moments that make you want to clutch your heart after a near miss of a saw blade or the gut wrenching feeling of taking a jump to just to realize you didn't take gravity into account and are now falling from the track. Even better yet tho is the feeling of making these mistakes and then through quick and crafty maneuvers recovering from your mess up without simply resetting to the last checkpoint. Now it seems that 3 of the main reasons people down rate this game are as follows. either they think the story is far to short and not worth the money, the online community is to small and have little servers running, or that they cant stand the music. Well let me explain why these should not effect your opinion. Firstly the story mode, Obviously its still incomplete. what they have is nice and when i first got the game a played it a bit and only did the story mode. after about 2 or 3 hours i finished it up and i to had the feeling that it was ok but may not of really been worth the money. However the Story mode is essentially just a tutorial to get you ready for the really great stuff. You see distance has and absolutely insane editor and some of the maps you play will feel worlds different from anything you've play previously. Many of the community levels have a higher difficulty level than the story mode the process of learning and attempting to play these levels are the best. What you play from the community levels will make your opinion of the game jump exponentially high. Now yes the community is small but its a strong community. I've rarely got to the server list and not had 2 to 3 games to join. Its not the kind of game that needs tons of servers. sure it could be a bonus if they had more but everyone is just playing a bunch of maps generally ranging from 5 to 15 mins levels and then rotating to a new level. Finally the music, personally i like it but more then a few people complain that they just cant stand it. Thing is the dev has an option to point the game to your own music library to play in game. With this enabled you'll get all the flashy effects of having the background lights of certain levels sync to your music or if you chose to enable it you can have music bars on your car window that move to the beat of the music. All In all its a great game, keep in mind theres a reason most of the bad reviews have such low gamplay hours. They didn't play the community levels, they didn't bother to learn how to play the game, or they didn't bother play online after seeing so little servers etc. Theres a reason the fanbase of this game while small is so strong and a reason for its 94% positive rating. The developers continually update it and what they have currently is just amazing. I believe the story mode is the last major thing that they will be adding to the game although i could be wrong as they my have even more up they're sleeve. They have many modes Sprint being the most prominent. The Sprint mode is Simply get from point A to point B. generally they'res a clear path and checkpoints to take however if you have the skill, knowledge, or luck you can take your car off track in an attempt to find a shortcut. trackmogrify - This mode lets you input any seed and it will randomly generate a track using it. It actually works surprisingly wellChallenge - a mode where you have nor resets, checkpoints and only one life on small tracksStunt - do tons of tricks to get the most pointstag - get the tag for as long as possiblespeed and style - do the track as quickly as possible with lots of trick points All in all its a great game with tons of replay ability and i highly recommend it to anyone who wants a new racing experience unlike any they've had before.

								where to start?Beautiful game that runs perfectly smoothly, stunning graphics and such an amazing idea. i am a huge fan of tron style artwork and such, and combining it with a game like this is my ultimate dream. reasonably priced, however i managed to boot up the game and finish the whole campaign in 1 hour, which is approx 15 levels? it does say there are more to come and the devs work so hard on this. i absolutely support these guys and cant wait for the story to be fully fleshed out, i wanna see big bosses or you fighting the infection, resolutions etc! $20 is worth it for such an awesome game. music is divine also, especially on monolith! one problem is that controls are a bit tricky and i would recommend getting a logitecg steering wheel, ive tried one at a friends place and it makes everything easier and better. other than that, flawless game, i cant wait to see what the community will be able to do with a completely open level editor, kinda like how trackmania had servers hosted and crazy custom modes, you could almost say its nearly a cross between gmod and rocket league.absolutely sublime. 420/69 would gaben again.

								Do you like geometry dash? With the amazing colours, music and intensity then all I can say is that you will love this game. This is like the geometery dash of racing. It's also got some awesome damage system to your car, kind of like phyiscs. I have barely played this game and I absolutely love it already. All I wish for is some server support because right now you have to host the server yourself or find someone else that is hosting one in the browser which is okay but sometimes people can all end up hosting and no one will join due ot it. The only dissappointment I have with this game is the Adventure mode. I am well aware that it isn't finished but when I first saw it I thought I'd be exploring a dangerous city with my car and making my own tracks ( Chosing certain paths) But it turned out to be a bit more like a story mode which is fine with me just wish there was an open world exploration feature like I explained. Another suggestion would be maybe some online in this mode with maybe weapons??? LIke a neon cannon. I am letting my imagination take me away here but it's still a thought. So yeah I definetly recommend this game. Simply amazing.			"

								Love this game to pieces! It has much more than your typical racing game.One thing I'd enjoy though is if it came to Wii U or the upcoming Nintendo NX, utilizing the motion controls for this would make it feel so realistic, and if the rumours are true, NX will have a ""fun"" and ""social"" VR system.Two years ago I read online that Distance may come to all consoles, but I haven't heard anything else about it. Come on, Refract! We want console ports!Still, this game is amazing even if it's only for PC right now, and it works on Low-End Computers too, which is a huge plus, and it still looks beautiful.I give this game 4 hairy thumbs up and a pinky toe, because it's so darn awesome!I would've loved to be a beta Tester, but sadly I didn't get a chance.

								This game is well done. It takes racing to a whole new level. It is beautiful and the game mechanics are smooth. It is a game that takes skill to be a good racer. One thing that I might add to this game is the ending in Multiplayer. I think there should be an option for a player to play as a ghost while waiting for others to finish. For an early access game, I'm actually surprised how good it is. Very well done. Can't wait for more of the campaign!			"

								He's going the distance! He's going for speeeed!That pretty sums up this game..Although a bit buggy in its glitchy controls and gravity is weird at times... it is really great community game with an awesome level editor.Also I can only recomend this game to those who are a fan of the racing genre of games. This is not the game for those who hate racing games.			"

								Tired of racing around in slow, not neon cars?How about racing through TRON ON ♥♥♥♥ING CRACK?You ever played Motorstorm: Pacific rift? Sure you have. So you'll know that the turbo warning sounds exactly the same, but feels 6 times as good.Jump over ♥♥♥♥ing laserbeams as you race your way through the insides of a corrupted computer file as electronic music and neon lights fill your bitter body with adrenaline and joy.Even better, ride right into those lasers and watch your car being split in two, AND KEEP ON RACING.Jump and twist your car at 250 mph in mid air so you can ride whichever wall you see, whether they're background props or not.Not enough? How about transform your car into a plane so you can ride UNDERNEATH of the track you're supposed to go over.WELL GEE THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF FUN, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEON AND THE MUSIC?Electro music blasting on your eardrums as the lighting dims and drums on every beat, makes me go ecstatic.Levels change their primary colour every few miles and can really change the mood of the track. As soon as the level turns red, you know you got to go fast.This game is THE hypest♥♥♥♥♥♥ neon 90's computer racing, tight controls, fun to just ♥♥♥♥ around in and jump into the scenery, riding every wall you can find, multiplayer, a great sound track which interacts with the lighting, NEON DEATH SAW BLADES/ CRUSHERS/ LASERS IT SERIOUSLY HAS IT ALL.The only downside to this game is that the sense of speed should be somewhat higher, I don't really see this being played competitively online, and the fact that it's early access so you're short a few tracks.TL;DR: If you like videogames, buy this. If you don't like videogames anymore, buy this.			"

								Certainly looks like it could be very good. But I feel it has a way to go.I've got >2.5k hours on TM2 stadium, so anything which is likened to that I'm naturally interested in.And I've probably not spent long enough on it to really judge, but the things that immediately occured to me (comparing it to TMS, as that's my prime reason for being here) are; + Great graphics; yeah - dig that Tron %$! - Dark graphics - can't see where to go == skill? Rly? + Interface is pretty slick - But this *is* TM I'm comparing it too.. - Controls (using XBox like controller) seem bad; more digial, less analogue. TM is designed for KB, yet it manages to support analogue input sublimely, too. - Physics seem a bit light. This is tenuous, as I admit I've not really played enough to really get the feel of things. + Flying - Oh yeah; there's a whole shedload of distance to be got from that, if it's used right. - Speed - No; I don't agree so far. Unless you hold boost down all the time (which you can't) it seems a tad pedestrian. Maybe I've just not got far enough into it yet. + Soundtrack - I really don't like this kind of music. But I found myself leaving it on, anyway. So that's good, right?Overall, I'm glad I supported this, and hope it delivers what I'm looking for. But I doubt this'll ever be the eSport game that TM2s is.			"

								This game. I don't know how I can describe it. At the very least, I can say it's beautiful. It's fun. It's amazing. I can put all these words down, yet it will never hold a candle to the true beauty this game is. It shines so much, for a game that's still only in early access. Hell, even if it weren't in early access, it's amazing.Pros:-Amazing level design.-Even with no story, story mode doesn't feel aimless, and it feels like I'm truly racing towards my next objective, whatever it may be.-Credits area is amazing. I spent almost half an hour just driving around exploring.-Music is amazing, and fits the atmosphere of the levels near perfectly.Con(s):-Needs more occurances of certain things, AKA: The machines(?) that flew around and got in your way, and you had to jump through hoops (Literally) to get past them. Also needs more no gravity areas, possibly even one in the credits level.Overall impression: Amazing game, love it to death. Was everything I hoped it would be and more. 9.5/10.			"

								Like racing games? Games that are fun yet challenging? Definitely give Distance a try! They created Nitronic Rush which is free to play (And feel free to check out as well) and they are back and improving it! Distance is a game where you can control a vehicle around a track with many obstacles by flying, jumping, and even grinding your way to victory.  In my personal opinion, I love the game. It runs real smooth, and it has a soundtrack like no other! If you like speed running, or just having fun this is a good one! They also have multiplayer which makes it much more interesting! If I haven’t convinced you enough, go check out any of the trailers online or go give Nitronic Rush a try before you buy Distance! Trust me, you will not regret it! 9.7/10 Early Access Review "

								It's basically Nitronic Rush's child, so if you've played that, you know what to expect.The controls are responsive and smooth but may take awhile to get used to for some. The driving physics are incredible.There's a couple different game modes (via Arcade) and a (unfinished) ""story"" mode, which all basically involve getting from point A to point B without getting your♥♥♥♥♥killed by buzzsaws, suddenly-appearing barriers, red beams that will leave your car clean shaven, and exploiting gravity.The graphics and atmosphere are extraordinary. Just look at them; they speak for themselves. The soundtrack fits the atmosphere very well also. It's incredibly easy to be immersed and engaged.Expect more user-made content via level editors as well.I am unsure how well multiplayer works, since I haven't tried it.The only real problem I've found is it has crashed two or three times while playing, so it may not be the most stable yet, though this IS in early access, so it's understandable. Beyond that, it's excellent and a worthy successor to Nitronic Rush.			"

								What can i say about this game ? It's a masterpieceFirst i will start with the good stuff. 1. Optimized well.2. Beautiful Graphics.3. Epic gameplay 4. The adventure (Story Mode) is good , Its not in its final state yet but i really loved how it ended. (ATM)5. Local CO-OP. Remember those days when you was a kid bringing all your friends infront of the TV playing some racing games on the console. Well its time to bring back some memories with your friends and have a great time playing this game.6. The mechanics of the game are so perfect.7.Its still on Beta , I cant wait to see its final form. Bring it on !Its time for the bad stuff isnt it ?1. There are some bug issues.( I personally think that they will be fixed soon) You dont have to worry about it they are small and almost dont matter.2. The custom AUDIO thingy is a bit odd and needs to be replaced, with an easier thing that can broswe your files instead of using the exact name with the file. 8/10 (since its early access) I will change to 10/10 if i will see the final release and like it.

								If you'd told me last week that I'd be praising a driving game for it's atmosphere, I'd have laughed in your face, but the atmosphere in ﻿ＤＩＳＴＡＮＣＥ is unbelievably great. The music and visuals combined with the very clever minimalist UI really draw you in; I can't wait how the campaign turns out in the final release.Beyond the eye candy, the game is a very competent racer, and for the most part the controls feel  great and responsive. It's hard to oversell ﻿ＤＩＳＴＡＮＣＥ, but it's also quite hard to describe in words what it is exactly that makes it so good.If you're on the fence, I recommend testing Refract studios' previous game, and spiritual predecessor Nitronic Rush[nitronic-rush.com], if you absolutely HATE that, then maybe hold off on ﻿ＤＩＳＴＡＮＣＥ, but otherwise I recommend giving it a try. Some of the best fun I've had pretending to drive a car...			"

								Nitronic Rush, the last title by this group, was an unbelievable physics racer. Distance only improves on the formula.Gone are the spin-outs and shifting of traditional racing games, replaced with sweet jumps, dextrous wall-hopping, and incredibly fast-paced speed. Everything I hate about racing games is gone, replaced by a style of driving that can only be described as vehicular parkour.Distance is a truly three-dimensional racer that's quick to pick up, but incredibly challenging to perfect. I hate racing games. I love Distance. Not sure if you want it? Nitronic Rush is free, and feels very much like an extended demo for Distance.(Your real value on purchase is access to all of the tracks off the Steam Workshop—Refract has given track-builders some very powerful tools for track creation, and the community has made some really excellent pieces of work)			"

								Racing, tricks, survival... i dont even know how to describe this game...You get this sick looking car, looks similar to a tron-mustang, and you get put on this epic track with wall-riding, driving on the cieling, loop-the-loops, jumps, even flying over large gaps, and your goal is to get to the end as quick as possible; but on top of that lets throw in some lasers and saw blades cutting your car into pieces. a turbo-boost system that nearly doubles your top speed, and tubes with spikes spinning everywhere that will either blow you up or send you flying off somewhereThis game is absolutely insane, but it does require a decent computer, especially in the tracks with more lasers/saws/spikes/etc (Though if you still want to play a game, there is a dumbed-down version called Nitronic Rush, same developers, nearly-identical game, but can run on an easy-bake oven)GET THIS GAME PEOPLE, NO REGRETS!!!

								This game has eaten up the free time I have, I love the community levels that this game has to offer so they fill the void of the currently unfinished storyline along with the track generator, track editor, multiplayer, and the arcade mode.This game will be very great when it is 100% ready, but for now I still love to play it			"

								Interesting racing game. If you don't know whether you will like it or not, you can test the game that the developers have worked on before called nitronic rush which is free to find on their website. I really enjoy this game. First you will try to finish a race and after you will need a good time before being able to race car to car with other players.			"

								This will my first review, but hot diggity damn, is it worth is.Distance is a game that takes all of the awesome things from Hot Wheels, Trackmania and slams it into a Tron-esque setting.  While the controls might take awhile to get used to, it's great once you get the hang of it.  While yes, this is a game that is in early access, and quite a few games have been put on early access and they completely blew, Distance is already awesome and content is continuing to expand.  Did I mention that there is an amazing community that releases wonderful maps?  Did I forget to mention the badass soundtrack that this game has?  Even if you dont like racing games , I would strongly encourage you to try this game.			"

								Okay, after playing online and what not for a while, I see a reoccuring theme. This isn't a racing game, it's a platformer. It can be great, I sometimes like it, but most of the time this platformer idea is beaten to the ground by some level creators, and people who choose to host lobbies. (Normal, public, racing lobbies are like rare af). I guess I'm an old school racer kinda guy but don't get me wrong I *can* enjoy platforming, when its done properly. However when it becomes 120% parkour, where the track forces you to take short-cuts only a selective few know, because they dedicate their time looking for it, it honestly becomes tiring. It really does.The visuals are amazing, there are spectactcular things to be said about this game but I find this parkour thing really changing my view towards this game.I find this isnt a game where you can sit and play for hours on end unless you're creating a level yourself. You will also find some hidden and not so hidden gems created by talented members of the community... and you will find levels where you will question if they even bothered to play test the level before publishing.I'm a verteran racer from WipEout so my views are biased. And at this point I'd recommend you stay clear from the game if you're a racing purist, because racing skills doesn't matter in this game, it's about who can maneuver their car through the air to some bs shortcut to finish first.

								Very good game. Flying still feels a bit wonky, and my hands can't get used to the fact that I need WASD for steering when flying, and the arrows for steering when driving. It just confuses me a little. But the driving feels absolutely epic, especially when you nail those jumps where you have to shift-the-gravity (so to say) 90 or even 180 degrees. I finished the campaign (as is it right now, in early access) in about 30 minutes, but the Arcade and Community made maps offer a huge amount of extra driving content. Definitely recommend this.			"

								THIS WILL HAVE TWO PARTS PVE AND PVP.PVEso i got the game. make a toon it has 1,2,3,4, pages of making one. then time to give it a name. name i want is taken ok but... it backs me out to page 1 and i have to repick everything for my toon again. this took like 15m as i really wanted a variant of that name. so now i get to long into game. befor i even move using w,a,s,d, i fall thro the floor of the viking area into water. ok its a new game so i relog get back into game now i am on a floor and i am able to use w,a,s,d, and read all the tool tips. now this part of the game i loved the graphics looked good, sound was great. i leave the main town i am atked by and npc right near the exit of the main town. i ran not knowing what lv the npc was and the town guards killed it. the controls are close to mount and blade warband and so is combat. i join a guild all nice guys and gave me a few tips. also i read a bit about the game befor i got it so i would know how to spend my str, dex, hp, points. so i was told i should go at lv 1 and kill lv 1-9 npcs near town i did but i found a lv 23 when i was only lv 2. i was able to kill it and i had 75% or so of my hp left. only do this if you are good at mount and blade warband as the exp is well worth it. so imo pve is greatPVPok so i goto a town with pplz from my clan we atk said town it had no players that i could see. a few npcs. we break a few gates with our spears and swords and take said town. i get paid for helping kinda like a mini quest i guss. then i goto a tournament where if you die you lose nothing ok great good way to get exp and test my skills. haha lol. its 19 vs 21 we had the 21. so its what team can get more kills in say 10m. its was 13 to over 100 near the end of the tournament my side lost. the lag i went thro was bad. i would be hitting someone and think i am doing great next thing i knew i was on the floor dead while the person i thought i was atking had little to no dmg. so imo PVP needs a lot of work befor its worth anything and since its the main part of the game well to me anyways i would say wait to get this game till they fix lag also i would say game is worth as is 10.00-15.00 so wait for a sale.

								This game is really quite great. I guess if you want to get a taster for it go on digipen and download nitronic rush. It's quite similar. The game is not finished yet obviously. But the reason I'm writing this is because of an update, which isn't official as in it's a beta update but it does a pretty good job at VR, I'm currently playing this game through the oculus rift CV1 as it supports 1.3 now and its a whole new experience. At it's current price it's probably not worth it, but if it ever goes on sale buy it straight away. The VR needs a little work as when you use			"

								So basically, after checking all the reviews and videos i found out that this game is supposed to be the successful remaking of Nitronic Rush. This game is fun, its just really short and it still feels like an early access beta game. I would reccommend downloading Nitronic Rush off of the devs website (just google Nitronic Rush) and if you like that and want a graphically revamped version, then buy this game. At the time of this review i have only played two hours of the game and i have made the decision to refund it purely because i dont believe you're paying for $20 of true content.			"

								I'm a writer for reaxxion gaming and I did a review for this game. In short I think it has one of the more innovative takes on futuristic racers I've ever played and I consider the game groundbreaking with it's parkour style of platforming. It lacks good mouse and keyboard controls (mouse has no function) and multiplayer isn't fleshed out at all because cars cannot colide into each other, but the sheer amount of constantly-updating community maps means you'll never stop returning to this game.

								The visuals are very good.The concept is awesome.I love the level editor.However ...1. When will racing game designers realize we want MOUSE <--X--> control for our vehicle movement?I cannot tell you how many good car racing games were throughly RUINED by not allowing my mouse to move me back and forth with precision.Audiosurf 1&2 got it right. I spent the better half of 45 minutes and $7 to buy JoyToKey to enable this feature that should have come installed. Even then I couldn't get it to work correctly as I desired.2. Next, the game would NOT release the camera look mode for the right stick. I hate camera mode. Like I want to look behind me or to the side of me when I am going 100kph ... then crash.3. Finally, you have to TYPE in the location into a TEXT FIELD to select an MP3 file.Can anyone say explore from here?Suggestions:1. Fix the X Mouse movement to be able to be mapped to X Movement.2. Give us control over the dang camera. Allow us to remap it or get rid of it.3. Allow the user to ""explore from here"" and not have to copy/paste the MP3 file location.I other words, play AudioSurf and DO WHAT THEY DID!6/10			"

Early Access Review
								Had Distance on my Radar for a while. It was a game I wanted to play in VR (and VR only) with my G29  steering wheel. Sadly it didnt work with my wheel and the VR aspect was off center (and I could find no way to re center myself). I did try briefly with a xbox 360 controller but that just isnt for me and felt...wrong (and keyboard and mouse isnt an option in VR for me).The games still in early access and I acknowledge things are subject to change but if you want to play in VR or with a racing wheel...hold off. I had to refund. I do hope to be able to buy again once it's out of early access (and VR + Wheel works how I'd like it to) but if you're a VR / wheel player...wait a while.I'm sure some players will question this review but I really do only wish to play in VR and with a wheel. I have no interest in any other playstyle nor do I want to spend hours setting the controls (if they can be tweaked) due to the 2 hr refund limit. Like I said..I'll try again when it's out of early access and update this review accordingly.			"

It's not necessarily a bad game though.  I just can't recommend it out of personal taste.			"

								This game is only in early access and the amount of work already put into this and the things you can do with the editor already blows my mind.I like to describe this as ""Super Meat Boy with Cars"", as the main goal of the game is to go to the end of the level while avoiding (sometimes) brutal obstacles.as for the level editor, I haven't done anything big but it reminded me a lot of blender, maybe because of the way it controls, I don't know, what I do know though is that the amount of things you can do is incredible.now, time to list the Pros and Cons of this game:Pros. :+ the idea of cars for a type of game like that is great and makes me wonder why it hasn't been done before.+ the controls work really well and are easy to get a grip on.+ The musics are great, they're not amazing in any way, but they work really well with the overall feel and futuristic theme of the game.+ The Graphics and 3D models look really good.+ The level editor is insanely powerfull for an early access game.Cons. :- Sometimes, the game will ask you to rotate you car 180° while in the air to stick to an upside down route, which doesn't seem to work half the time, could just be me being bad at the game though.All in all, this game is a must have if you like games such as super meat boy.Final Rating: 9.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Pros:+great mechanics+maps have shortcuts and different route's+price fits perfectly+Futuristic theme+fantastic map editorCons:-litte to no customization (can change a couple colors on car but no change in parts.)-After play for a long time maps can feel lifeless and look similar to eachother (not play similar, look similar)-Much like other racing games, it's boring when you aren't racing anyone. There isn't even an AI opponent if you wanna play singleplayer. Racing games rely on having an opponent so the singleplayer campaign is ultimatly pointless.-No drifting to get around sharp corners.            Even though thepositive's outweigh the negative's, the game gets stale really quickly in singleplayer. Since you care can't handle any sharp turns you'll spend most of your time going in straight/curved lines. I also think this game has a severe lack of customization, This game definitly needs more if it want's to survive. I also think map themes need to change, sure each maps has different designs but they all share the same neon-colored, futuristic, lifeless theme. It get pretty dull looking at after a while, even if it has amazing graphics. Not to mention there isn't even an AI option for offline. At the start when I bought this game I thought it was great, mechanics and graphics were great and it felt kind of fresh. But a couple years down the line and things have gotten kind of stale. I'll erase this review once things have started to change drastically.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been enjoying this game for its Tron-like ascetic. In the game you play a digitized car, zooming around death-dealing obstacles. My favorite part is when I careen into a laser; it cuts my car in half, but I manage to skid my way into the next checkpoint, regenerate, and continue to finish the race.I hope when the game has its official release I'll be able to recommend it, but I can't yet. That's because of the mechanic of track transfers.In most levels of Distance you're asked to leap from the horizontal track to a perpendicular or parallel one. This action feels rewarding when successful, but the trouble is twofold. First, these track transfers are hard to see coming. In some of the community-made levels, signs near and on the track make them clear. However, in many cases they just look like a simple jump or flight is required, and by the time you realize what the game wanted it's too late. Second, gravitational disparity makes the jump feel wonky, and it's extremely hostile to beginners. In Distance, sometimes you're racing straight downward in relationship to ground. Othertimes, you're perpendicular to it, and you're spiraling around so much that the only way to be certain of your position in space it to look down at a compass graphic on your car. If you don't, and you try to wall jump, you'll slew off in a random direction and miss the landing. Given that it's hard to see the track transfers coming at all, I never had time to look down at the compass before making the jump. This results in obstacles that feel impossible to get past the first time, or the first hundred times.			"

Early Access Review
								First impression: decent cart racer / runner.Why do I call this a cart racer? Because there's no handbrake. You have infinite grip, and jumps are a big part of it. That said, stunts are also a big part of it: you can jump, rotate your car mid-air and land on a track at right angles to it (or flip to a track on the ceiling), you can use wings and fly in some situations. Gravity is optional, and its direction is not always what you'd expect (jump off a wall, land back on the wall). Stunts are a big deal. So are obstacles on the road. The track design is reminiscent of trackmania (but the tracks seem shorter), and there is an editor and even a random track generator.That said, this racer is not about exploration, there is no city, and ""survival"" merely means that when a laser beam cuts your car in half, you can often regenerate when you reach a blue ring. If you expected anything like an open world and a free ride mode, you won't find it here.Since I bought this game for the exploration, and there is none, I don't recommend it.If you're getting it for the track-based stunt racing, your opinion is going to differ.

You can easily complete the whole game within 30minWhat I liked that Nitronic rush didn't have: You have 0 gravity at one point, which was awesome. You can drive with your car cut in half, you can even destroy it so badly that you can drive around with 2 wheels and still complete the map.What I didn't like: You can't jump while you use the nitro.You use the same button for jumping and flying..I really hope the developers keep working on this game, so I can recommend it to others!

								This game has SO much potential. The controls, the world, the driving, it's all amazing. The only problem is that there isn't enough to make it worth its cost. The Campaign is incredibly short, the multiplayer is almost entirely community driven, and the other game modes require friends who enjoy leaderboards. This honestly wouldn't be an issue since this game is in Early Access. However, the game has been in EA for years. Too little has happened in too long a time to make this game worth anything more than ~$8.00Also, there are no laps. Once you reach the finish line, that's it. This causes rounds to be incredibly short and too much time is spent in lobbies/loading screens.			"

								So, how long's it been since we had a non-workshop driven content update? Another to chalk down as Early Access Limbo. Maybe I could have more fun with the limited tracks if it had the old scratch engine instead of Unity making it feel totally uncontrollable. But as it is, I can't say it's really any fun for me.			"

								This is a really great arcade style racing game. I used to play Rush and F-Zero and have been looking for a good fast racing game. This game is fast, fun, and very enjoyable.EDIT!!This game is still a ton of fun but the developers need to finish the game. They are relying too much on community maps to drive the game. Also, trying to play co op with 2 controllers is cumbersome. For some reason it wouldn't let me pick just 2 players but would load a game with 1 or 3 players and I can't figure out why.If the developers finish the game anytime soon I will recommend this game to everyone but this game has been out in Early Access for a very long time and I don't see any signs of it being finished.Multiplayer is almost dead at this point as well. Games that rely on multiplayer to drive the game but stay in Early access for over a year is unacceptable. At this point there is no reason to play single player. It's an over glorified tutorial for community made multiplayer maps. There are no unlocks of any kind so what is the incentive to play single player at all. With no Single player game to retain the user base and a rapidly declining multiplayer community, this game needs to finish as soon as possible if it wants to survive.			"

								This is purely a critique for the Adventure/story mode or whatever it ends up being called.Slow. Really slow. For an arcade racer I would expect to be able to sit down and blast through the basic controls and gameplay mechanics in 15 mins or so, then have some high speed racing fun trying to beat an AI, the level, or my own time. I've played over 30 mins in adventure mode, figuring I could do the tutorial level then explore some other options - every level is long and boring, introducing controls and gameplay at a snails pace and the car itself moves slow as molasses, even when boosting. There's no sensation of speed, which is the pure basics for a racer.No AI, no time or points requirements to pose a challenge, each level is very long and slow to get through. And the car is slow.

								Can't say I didn't try it, but it had some things I normal try to avoid in fps games. The issue is that this is a high-octane racer, so the stuff really snuck up on me. It's honestly TOO fast, made for people with hyperactive reflexes normally found in characters from those Mortal Kombat movies and Dragon Ball shows. The graphics are godly, but that ruins the playability due to how overwhelming they are on a processor. The controls are obviously meant more for controllers, but even the controller controls require your fingers be contortionists to properly play. Plus, it isn't stable. No, not with good graphics, not with blegh graphics, not even with horse-crap graphics. (Might just be me, but the fact it's an issue is an issue.)			"

								A great game for speed runner type people. Fun Music, great looks, and the ability to create tracks to play.BUTThere is no car collision in this game, and there never will be. Not even an option to turn it on and off. All tracks are made in a sprint fasion, so no looping tracks with lap systems and there never will be. There will never be weapon systems for vehicles. All these things have been stated by developers and discussion board mods and they do not take well to suggestions. They made the game they wanted and are not willing to alter the game to make it fun for even more people. The more fun maps are quite long, and after the first minute you may never see another driver because you either got way ahead or way behind. This game is a lonely world with little to no interaction with other drivers.Their business plan reminds me of Joe Dirt. They like snakes and sparklers, but it's not about what they like, its about what the consumers like. I predict this game will nose dive just like elite dangerous. RIP			"

Need to simplify those keys. No longer wasd and arrow key pls (e.g. Rocket League's key would be very nice)3. Camera is very disturbing when driving back4. I fly, I was holding ↑ to accelerate, I crashed. Maybe change into other keys to control when mid air?---need to be fixed------need to be improved---1. More speedy speedy!2.

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI refunded distance for a reason. The only thing thats positive about it is controls. The car handles very well but the game fails in everything else.Graphics are ok but its like playing with no textures its a completely dull and lifeless world which doesnt keep you entertained. If there was at least multiplaye races but multiplayer is a joke. 1st there are no players and 2nd youi do not racee but instead try to complete the course without dying and you never get to see the other people because the speed of the cars is so fast that with a single second of difference youve already lost sight of your opponent. Also what is the fun in multiplayer if cars cant even collide. Its like racing against a ghost in a ghost barren town with 3 boring moves that are barely used and thats all the game is. If uit had maps like trackmania or the same maps but with actual races it woulñd be worth but evwen on sale it is not worth that much money for so little content			"

								I like racing games. But this has no AI to play against - it's just you and the course. (Will this be added after Early Access? I'm not sure.) There is online multiplayer, but I wasn't able to find anyone to play with.I guess the course hazards are the main point of the game, but I just found them annoying and not fun. Your car usually explodes after taking a single hit, which is kind of a bummer. It resurrects you a short distance behind where you crashed, so at least you don't have to start over.I guess this isn't for people who are looking for a traditional sort of racing game.Also, it doesn't work properly with the Steam Controller. For some reason, the button mappings are all wrong. The 360 controller works fine with this game.			"

Yeah I know there is multiplayer but I could not join any game and no one joined mine, so in the end I got super bored super fast.It feels empty and quite depressing. A shame because I was really looking forward to this game. But in its current form, I had it refunded.			"

								This game is a bit of a mess. For one thing, it has a feature where you use boosters to flip your car onto the ceiling. It sounds cool, but it's not executed well. There is never enough space to do it. There is nothing keeping you on the ceiling, either, so if you mess it up (which you WILL), then you're dead.The flight controls are too sensitive. To accelerate forward, you must hold down the Up Arrow key. That's also the key that causes you instantly dive forward in flight. After going over a jump, there's a good chance you'll kamikaze straight into the ground.And speaking of jumping, there's a jumping feature. Nothing feels more satisfying in this game then boosting off a ramp and pressing the Space Bar to send your car high into air. It feels amazing at first, until you realize that every land area after a jump has a low ceiling, meaning you plow straight into a building for trying to have fun.In the end, the game isn't buggy and the graphics are phonomenal, but the gameplay is lackluster.

								Distance, Spiritual successor to Nitronic Rush_______I played Nitronic rush for hundreds of hours and loved it, it was fast, the levels were short and it was just a good time. Distance on the other hand is a much better game mechanically, but my problem rests with the speed of the game, Levels drag on for ever, the random level generator generates boring stupid levels, and to top it all off it's just plain unfair at times. Another thing basically removed from the series of games is, when I played Nitronic Rush, I would fly around looking for shortcuts, missing as many checkpoints as possible, If you try that in distance you will fail horribly, as the game almost forces you to stick to the path (I know this is a weird complaint for a racing game) 4/10 - Good mechanically, boring. Would not reccomend in current state but devs are updating this regularlyMeanwhile, I'm about to ask for a refund "

								5 is an average game to me.So I give this game a 7/10Two things can make it betterPoints1: Throwing in a patch where players don't have to go out of their way to forward a net-code through their router just two get a public game.  That seriously needs to be fixed.  Even if the game is in beta form, most players might not stick around just for that reason.  I would add 2 points if that problem was fixed.2 Find something definitive to seperate Adventure from Arcade. I'd add one point if something that would make us actually want to play adventure, is patched in.  Some reason for why we are where we are and why our cars can do what they do would be nice.  In my opinion, to know more about my car would make me feel more investested in its usage. Every flip, or bounce, or sky manuever would give me higher levels of phychological investment, if I only knew, why these cars could do this.  Sure the game is still exciting.ReasoningNot asking for anything extravagent, but even inputted dialouge to help explain these things seems nice, whatever is done, if anything is done, I'd trust Refract to execute it well. If explaining the car seems like a bit much maybe only give details to us in layers like in the loading screen, not just the car blueprint but the script for what it does in more detail and why it is there with arrows pointing to that specific part. I don't know what those things are marked ""A"" ""B"" and ""C"" for because nothing explains them. Everything else about this game looks and plays excellent.Other than those two things.  This game is awesome.  Keep up the good work, and I would'nt deduct anything from this, but if Refract could maybe dumb down track editing to like a Halo style map creation, or Trials Evolution.  That would be great as well.  I'm not to tech swavey when it comes to this game's level editing format.:::EDIT:::Actual GameplayI forgot to add this in but its about the actual gameplay.  It runs very smooth and with all the good reviews pointing out how great the car you control handles I considered whether my input on that matter was needed.  But I'll do it anyway.I've never played an arcade racer with a car that handles with such precision WITHOUT making you feel like the track controls the car.  This game makes me feel like I control my car at extreme high levels of speed on the tracks riddled with death traps.  There are portals that warp you to another location, or verticalitty.  It took me awhile to figure out I was racing upside down because everything looks right-side up.  And that is pretty cool.  As long as you have speed, you will never fall off the track if you arn't most likely defying the laws of physics.  If you do lose speed, better hope you can open you car doors and use them like gliders.  Not all tracks offer the feature, and on some tracks you can only open the doors at certain parts.  It is executed nicely. There is also a bounce menuever where you spring yourself off the surface to jump over a death trap or get yourself to a higher seperate plane. The tracks can split, or sometimes you can just flyoff completely and find a new path.  This game offers space.  And that is my favorite thing in any racer.  Great handling, and outrageously fun and spacious tracks.:: EDIT, AGAIN ::TLDR:  In short now, I did give this games a thumbs up.  The port-forwarding lobby creating situation still isn't fixed at all, which should be the priority.  As I said above, this game wont last long while porting ourselves to make it work is just a nusaince most people wont bother with.  It's still fun to play even solo, but for new comers looking at online play, if you want a good arcade racing game and dont care about playing cool tracks alone, I'll say get it, for $5.  Other than that, I can't recommend.I say repeatedly the game is awesome, that's because it is a good arcade racer.  But I'm a multiplayer guy having me portforward a code for a game that is on it's online lifeline (probably because other people don't want to bother to port-forward as well) is just not worth it. The online on this game will be dead before it gets out of the beta stage.  I'm willing to bet.Save your money.			"

								Great Idea, horrible controls. Do you like doing the same thing over and over again, stuck in the same spot forever..♥♥♥♥♥♥poor gravity on a gravity bassed racer. I so wanted to love this game....but it plays like an alpha.  If you like controller breaking frustration in your racers  and punching youself in the head this is sooo the game for you. And Yes, I do understand that the game is still in development but making it so you can COMPLETE a race even in the early stages of development would be a good idea. This thing should not of even passed  Greenlight. For shame. Thank goodnes for Steams return policy.			"

								This is my personal opinion, no one elses. I got the game thinking it would be a future-istic racing game, and I an sort of wrong. The game is fun do get me wrong but for 22 bucks (CAN) its just no worth it. I would recomend this on a sale, full price is wasting your money. Very limited online players (at the time I played). Over all 6/10. Good attempt but just isnt right there. Give it a few more months/years and more gamemodes and better online, then it would be worth it. Just my opinion.			"

								Would not recommend as an Early Access game, there simply isn't enough here, and it's much too similar to Nitronic Rush at the moment to be a strong recommendation.  Lives off the user-submitted levels, but a lot of them are simply unexciting.  Maybe I'm missing something, but something about the package as it is during Early Access simply isn't adding up.  Not bad.  Just disappointing.			"

								Rule 1 of judging a game: If it's been in Early Access for literal YEARS, it sucks. Distance proves this quite nicely. It attempts to be a variety of driving game genres(drag races, stunt competition, shoehorned story mode), and fails miserably at all of them. The devs didn't let us try it at PAX a few years back, when it was available for sale at that, because they knew their game sucks.EDIT: What I called drag racing was actually sprint racing. I just had the urge to make an awful pun. I'm not sorry.			"

								I read few of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and bought the game while it was on sale, and sorry to say, am a bit disappointed.The visuals are somewhat stylish, albeit not so good looking if you aren't into neon lights especially. The highly praised audio felt boring and distant, if you will - and I'm into electronic music. Playability is fine, although the car feels very strange, it moves almost like on rails or something. No slipping or anything at all.All of this could be forgiven if only there was _content_. But there just simply isn't. I played through the single player ""campaign"", and it was probably one of the most boring hour of gaming in years. This game seriously needs AI competitors. Someone to tackle into the lasers. More speed, lots of it. Weapons. Explosions. Forget twisting in zero gravity and those stupid jumps into the ghost world or whatever it was. Bring us more action. And if guns and fire isn't the thing here, at least make it clear what is.I'm having hard time deciding what this game tries to be. Is it trying to relax or excite? Currently, it only bores. Not recommended, although there is potential, it just needs a lot more content. A lot.Edit:Some more info about my gaming history. I loved Flatout: Ultimate Carnage (it had great sense of speed). Burnout Paradise, Need for Speed series, Fatal Racing, Screamer, to name a few - all of them I did enjoy more or less. Each had more speed and excitement than this one.			"

								This game is luminous. Very Impressive.BUT , I think, if you, developers, are reading this, this game need something more. I don't know how to describe it but when i was playing, i feel like I drove car with no objective. Just avoid the obstacles, change the lane, flying for the upcoming warpgate, not know what to drive for. You need to stimulate players to continue playing like .. challenging with other AIs, pursuing for the antagonist, running for something, or escape the terminater(not Skynet lol). And getting some points to claim the reward like skins, accessories, or even new cars. The other one is a result pop-up when finishing the stage. Show some numeric results that make me like ""LOL! Anybody wanna beat me up?"" such as total destruction, closely evade bonus, and something like that. Leaderboard might be needed.Anyway, the others that is not included above is very, very good. I really like it. :)So when you have fixed these that i told, and the game has been commercial, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone.P.S. Sorry for some grammatical wrong. I'm improving my English skill.			"

								I suggest before purchasing this you download the game ""Nitronic Rush"".  It's a f2p by what looks like the same developers.  You should be able to tell from the trailers of both they are nearly identicle.  I really am not as sucked into this as I initially thought i would be, the levels feel the same to me and so do the cars.  I really can't recommend it one way or another as I think this just isn't my type of racing.  It's a neat concept but I prefer simulators with real cars and the ability to modify and tune.   Game is decent but it should be f2p.  Now, steam is making me choose to recommend it or not, I personally choose no but that's just me.			"

								Interesting concept and good sense of speed. Problem is the game is horribly optimized. I have a 970 and have to turn the settings down somewhat, and even then the framerate is all over the place. Even worse my friend has and i7 4790k oc'd with SLI 970s and he sees frequent frame drops. With a measly and laughable 8% - 38% usage of his gpus. The highest usage I've seen my 970 get is 47%. The fact that I have to struggle to get 60fps when I'm very far and beyond the recommended requirements is absolutely unnacceptable. It's crude to charge money for something so unfinished. For perspective; Crysis 3 on Very High runs better than this game on Medium. It's insulting.Also, this game is not so much a racer as it is a driving platformer. The difficulty seems to be more centered around avoiding obstacles rather then driving skill and track design, so don't go in expecting it to be like Trackmania with obstacles.Really there is a great game in here wanting to get out, but it's held back by lack of content and very poor optimization.

Early Access Review
								A much simpler and less gripping Nitronic Rush for the weak of will and poor of heart. I've been playing arcade racers since the dawn of time, and this game is an utter joke compared to anything from its predecessor, Nitronic Rush, to F-Zero. Tracks offer low complexity obstacles, no need for boost management, and long stretches of road that give you nice eye candy but a severe reduction in challenge overall. If you've never played an arcade racing game before, or if you self identify as a casual gamer with a love for being held by the hand in your games, I would recommend this game to you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.Just because a game is in Early Access doesn't mean it should follow such a dull design philosophy, as is the case with Distance. The game's track design is completely devoid of challenge, and if you're lucky you might find one decent track in a half-hour of scrounging through the Steam Workshop.Worst of all is the ""Trackmogrify"" feature. Even though the game's pre-constructed track design is already insultingly dull and unchallenging, the developers have added a track creator that spawns fresh tracks that are just as dreadful as, if not worse than, what's already built into the game. Just like the first time you are called a ""donkeyball hosedick"" or ""bullcock hobgoblin"", you will laugh a bit at how poorly you've been insulted but also feel a little stung at the same time.tl;dr If you really need to spend $20 and don't know what to do with it, do something more productive like flush it down the toilet			"

								I have decided to rewrite my review from scratch and delete the older one as I have now played more of the game and can give a better account of my experience. The good:I love the setting of the game. I like the Tron-esque visuals, the throbbing lights that dance to the rhythm of the beat, and the accompanying soundtrack. Overall, the atmosphere is done well and delivers on what you see in the screenshots. The handling of the cars are also pretty good, and a keyboard is a viable alternative (some even say a keyboard is better than a controller in this game). The main driving controls are easy to learn, though it may take some time to fully grasp the controls to do 90- and 180-degree flips, as well as the controls for the flying sections. Level editors. I have not explored this myself yet but I have played a number of user created tracks and it seems like a pretty good and functional feature. The not so good:Multiplayer is “broken” in the sense that the game condones “cheating”. Some people may like this, but I don’t. Basically, all the top racers and top time in the leaderboards are set by people who fly far off the racing track and find their own shortcuts (through buildings etc). I personally hope that the developers can consider adding a separate mode that somehow mandates you cannot leave the track (via checkpoints for example). Game isn’t properly optimized well at the moment, though the developers acknowledge this and have come on record to say it will be improved. Still, be wary that you may need to turn down quite a number of settings on a card that exceeds the recommended requirements and even then not get 60fps all the time (I have a GTX 750 SC for reference). Performance in multiplayer is much worse than single player.The adventure mode at present has zero story to it. It is a glorified tutorial at best. I find it hard to believe there will be a story by the time v1.0 releases since the devs say more levels are to be added, but in the 45 mins or so of content that there already is, there is nothing like that. Still, adventure mode is a must to grasp the basics of the game to move on into multiplayer.The difficulty is kind of high at present, and it may turn off many people. It would be good if the developers can allow the community to rate tracks with different difficulties, especially those that are user created. Would be also nice for the developers to create some “normal” racing maps that don’t have so many outrageously difficult sections!There are other broken multiplayer features. If you join a lobby with a user created track, the game just tells you that you have a missing level, but doesn’t prompt you to download it. Also, if you finish a race early, you may have to wait for minutes. Would be nice if there is only a 30 or 60 seconds window from the time the winner finishes before moving on. There are a few others things that should be in I believe. A single player mode that allows you to race against CPU AI (currently, you can only do speedruns in single player). Also, randomized obstacle placements would be nice. ---------------------------------------Bottomline, I would say that overall I am not too happy with my purchase. Yes, this is in Early Access, but I don’t see how they can change so much of the game. If this game sounds interesting to you fundamentally, then sure, go get it. But if you are like me, expecting a more “normalish” arcade experience, I suggest you stay away.  "

								This game is such a mess and not because it's Early Access.You want to know what made Trackmania work despite it's crazy tracks?  Because it had mandatory checkpoints you had to go through so you couldn't skip half the track using a jump or find a ""weak point on the track""In Distance, this isn't even remotely the case.  Multiplayer consists of people just jet flying to skip a good portion of the track as a ""shortcut"" which makes the game dull and uninteresting.This sucks because the music and art direction are superb, but it's a complete garbage when it comes leaderboards and time trails.  In short, this is a waste of 20 dollars and I would not recommend this to anyone.  It's almost as bad as spending money on Call of Duty Advanced Warfare.			"

However the controls being bugged when i first opened the game is still an issue you may want to consider when buying this game. This game however is just amazingly satisfying in a really simple way, it just gets everything about going fast right (that games like sonic just can't seem to master with possibly the exception of sonic generations) and the tracks that come with the game are incredibly well mastered. The sound track is really, really good.			"

								This game is in Early access as of writing this, i just played the story mode and 3 of the auto generated maps.The story mode is cool, though there isnt much obvious story, and it's not finished. The ""tutorial"" is well done, the mechanics and controlls are spot on, every death was my own fault, not the cause of clunky/unresponsive controlls.The auto generated maps are cool, if a bit short. they can be extreemly hard or super easy, but there should be some way of ajusting that. Only downside is that the map i called ""20 minutes"" was no longer than the other two maps i got (about 3 min each).They could release this game and work no further on it and it'd still be worth the price, but i got the feeling that they want to do alot with the story mode and i look forward to exploring that and tryint to figure out what's going on in the world they'r building arround the game.Fully recommend!

								The successor to Nitronic Rush, Distance builds on what Nitronic Rush did right and adds more and improves. It keeps the wall/ceiling-riding, barriers, materializing walls, lasers, and saws. The stopwatch and the heat meter are moved from the HUD to the car. The lasers, instead of making the car explode, saw them in half. The announcer is removed. The visuals have improved quite a bit and the art style is incredible. There is a Steam Workshop and a map creator.  I loved Distance's predecessor and I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for this game.Use Nitronic Rush as a demo!http://nitronic-rush.com/ "

								It's been a few days, since my original thumbs down review and I'm already back to change my vote. This game will grow on you. It for sure did grow on me.This game has a dev team that listens a great community and is just plain fun. It also has some more advanced skill stuff that allows you to progress to tougher tracks and gives it more longevity. Compared to your average racing game it is much more action packed and is far more innovative. I for sure recommend this game.One of the main things that turned me off early on was the Adventure mode... It seems to be meant as a tutorial, however it quickly becomes too difficult for a newb and starts to feel like some frustrating puzzle game. I began to think the whole game was like that. Thankfully it's definitely not. I had simply strayed into a more advanced skill section than I was ready for.My recommendation for players is to play adventure mode to get the hang of the controls, but as soon as it starts to feel hard switch to Arcade -> Solo -> Sprint or Transmogrify. For the devs, might want to separate the tougher stuff from the tutorial, IMO. And maybe make a skills challenge mode to practice more advanced skills.Another big reason I changed my vote is that the devs and community are very responsive. When I asked for more settings for the Transmogrify random tracks I was sent this address: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19FYXnXRm9SWmzm-KjSx3dThvDLn2rYktWRbaz_Ugu6kIt gives seed words to give me some control over the random tracks.I was also told that I could just leave the seed line completely blank and the game would provide some seeds. I think that is now my favorite way to play. I can even look for seeds that I happened to especially like, or maybe dislike, for future reference.Anyway, I would still like some in game transmogrify settings, and for sure a favorites list for transmogrify tracks... But the main thing I want to say is that the more I play this game and the more my skill improves, the more I really enjoy it.			"

								Note: this review is more like a complain, rather than a review, distance is a very good game, i will just post my complaints here:Ok first let me tell you where i'm coming from.I played Nitronic Rush and then i discovered this game (Distance is the spiritual succesor of Nitronic Rush), While a lot of aspects have been massively improved (the graphics and especially the track editor) i have some complaints.I'm having a lot of issues with Distance that i didn't have with Nitronic Rush (I will call it NR from now and on), first the gravity:In Nitronic Rush you had to learn how gravity worked, you could not just jump to the next piece of road and expect the car to land perfectly on it, especially on 90º roads, you needed a very good knowledge on how the car moved and when you needed to jump, even the smallest jump needed to be taken seriously.Now this aspect is completely broken in Distance, gravity feels like is not there, jumping and landig is way more easier and it seems like they even help you by rotating your car precisly to make a landing, especially on 90º and upside down roads.Another aspect i feel like is missing in Distance is the diversity with the music, in NR every track had a very distinctive music that was very easy to differentiate with other ones, but in Distance it feels like every track is just a remix of the previous one, i mean where is that 8 bit theme? or that old-school rock?And final complaint is the difficulty, NR had a very distinctive way to differentiate it's diffulty, first the story levels that were easy, then the hardcore levels, which were normal, and then we had the community hardcore, which were so hard that i even can't complete some of them. But in distance everything is just to easy, and it takes forever to find a hard track on the steam workshop, i miss the challange that NR offered me, i miss those tracks like loopy, kill it with fire or insanity rings (just to name a few).In short, distance is way better than nitronic rush in general, but i just that this game would be even better with those things NR did better			"
