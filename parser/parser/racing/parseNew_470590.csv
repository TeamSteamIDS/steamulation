												Game has very cool graphics and was fun. But it was a very short game, i beat it in like 30 minutes. It was pretty easy all the way through.			"

												It is a neat little arcade racing game, though it could last a tad bit little longer. The visuals are pretty to look at and the music is pretty catchy. I would recommend checking it out.			"

												Bloody hell this is amazing. Controls are simple, the graphics are GORGEOUS (and also quite trippy), and it's just plain fun. It's a bit simple at first but then gets a bit difficult (but not too difficult). I'm having a great nostalgic rush by just playing this. It gets a ""Very good!"" on the Hoovie Scale!			"

												I was experiencing technical difficulties with this game, they offered me assistance and helped me fixing the issue sending me a custom built, even though 4:3 monitors aren't that common anymore, and therefore fixing this problem would impact only a small percentage of their players.Nonetheless, incredible care from their side, I haven't tried the game yet as I'm still having problems with my issues, but they're promtly helping me to solve the problem the game is exactly as advertised, I find it quite challenging but it's probably all about getting used to it (I played barely 5 minutes at this time); as final note, several other review point out how the game is relatively short and can be beated in a few hours, considered the price tag and the care the developers have for the customers, if you remotely like the concept, I think it's definitely worth to support them.Get a copy for yourself and gift one to the friend(s) you think might enjoy this: rkd.zone deserves it!

												This game is so fun! Its basically a fast paced dodging game, not a racer, as you don't really control the speed of the bike. Pros: Fast PacedSimple casual game experienceBeautiful to look atMusic is generally pretty goodLevel design and difficulty curve is interesting, especially the asian themed level.Cons:At the moment its a bit too easy, I am no expert gamer but I managed to finish it on 4th play though. So not a lot of replay value. But at this price its hard to complain too much.Hopefully some updates will add difficulty modes or other game modes to give it a bit more replay value.			"

												Bought for and played on Linux (atm controller support is bugged but being worked on, make sure you DO NOT have your controller plugged in before or during gameplay. just leave it unplugged :P )This is a VERY simple arcade racer, and a digital recreation of racing toys that pre-date the days of computers. In my opinion the Dev nailed it and then some. Just enough of a challenge/frustration factor to keep me interested and a few surprises along the way; I was not expecting so much for so little.Also I love the sound track =D			"

												Jesus, this game a Blast. Its like going back on time to the 90's arcade racing games. Simple gameplay (gear up, gear down, left and right), but really hard to master. The music is incredible too, what makes the game more amazing xD!Also, this is a GAME, plug and play. Easy as that, you dont need to get by lots of menus, or anything like that. Juts open, and race.Really really happy to find this little game. 10!			"

												What i love is the mechanical feeling to moto rkd dash, it really reminds me of a pinball mechanical machine. It would be interesting to see a real machine of this. Also i feel the constant feeling of falling down, while the horizon goes up is hypnotizing. I love it!			"

												Moto RKD dash is a tribute to the good'ol arcade games from the 80's, it also seems to be a remake from an old forgotten game & watch (which is unlockable and playable ingame), and it's also a short trip under LSD that you can get for cheap.The purists who enjoyed playing on arcade cabinets back in time will appreciate Moto RKD Dash at it's true value, although the game is short (it has only 9 levels and can be finished within 20mn), and that the gameplay doesn't vary especially during the trip, the really enjoyable aspect is that all levels have their own totally different scenery and soundtrack, which makes the game never boring. A very positive point for the trippy trance soundtracks which are of a great quality.And one very good other point is the graphic design with the choice to put the road in a perspecive vision that is very trippy and impressive at 60fps, especially on a large screen.Even if on some aspects the game looks unpolished, I would recommand it. It has a lot of replayability, especially if you are a achievement hunter or a high-score ranker. The game includes a leader board and trading cards, and one more cool thing is that the dev is very active on the community, which is a particulary good point.7/10			"

												This is a fun , addictive and simple arcade game  that is very similar to hang-on . The gameplay consitsts of moving the bike left or right and pressing the up and down arrows in order to shift  gears like in outrun. The level design is nice with varying levels of diffculty and objects to block your path from other bikes on the road to trucks and the sides of buildings. There is an android and ios version which plays  no different from the PC version and if  you own both a computer and a mobile phone which  most people do in this day and age I would seuggest pciking up both in order to support the developer this is a great game and I recommend it to all			"

												Boring! its like NASCAR without the left turn.all you do is get it into 2nd and avoid the other racers on a strait track until you win or use up your 30sec on fuel. i don't know maybe my a.d.d. was kicking in but i need more. graphics are nice and its not bad for a few levels but i'm not really with it.

												Option system not really working good under Linux, can't see what choices are made there, they disappear. The game itself was really shallow, not at all what I expected from reading the reviews and watching the videos/screenshots. Doesn't feel like a complete game.			"
