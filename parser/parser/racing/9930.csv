												I'm a big fan of driving games, whether it be GRID, Forza, Gran Turismo... you name it I've played it.Test Drive Unlimited 2 got a lot of bad ratings from companies, but they never understood what it was made for. It wasn't designed for racing, yeah it had a racing storyline on the side, but coming from TDU1, it was all about driving around a beautiful island with your friends calmly and enjoying the scenery.So if you are looking for a game where you drive to 3 million miles an hour crashing at every corner, go play need for speed. But if you're looking for that one game you actually enjoy doing nothing but driving around on... this is for you.Most underated driving game of all time.If I had to choose my most favorite driving game... this would be No. 1.ps. dont be fooled by the small amount of hours I have on steam, I have over 500 on my xbox.

												DO NOT BUY! IS NOW A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!1. Server is no longer operational2. Absolutely no support for new players3. Asks you to creat an atari account which is no longer supported and therefore impossible for new people.4. If running win10 it is a 50/50 chance you will be able to play it, if not then the only way to fix is a clean install of the OS and they may not work the first time. Please do not take this as me saying the game is bad. I have put around 1000+hrs in to the game on xbox and wanted to try and relive those memories on the PC. The game was superb, driving was a mixture of simulation/arcade style, leaning towards the simulation. Graphics were on point for the date of release. It was generally just an incredibly fun game that was totally original :) Now however, you are simply paying money for a product which wont work. Paid full price to find they don't even support the F**KING launcher!!			"

												This game was worth it, when I first bought it servers were running and there were a decent amound of people online, the game was quite fun, you could make your own paint jobs for your cars and upgrade them (small amount). The driving was sometimes annoying, but it was still a lot fun with the open world it had, you could buy appartmens, houses and with them came garages that you could, of coarse, fill up with thje many vehicles you could buy.Now, I cannot recommend anyone buying this game, you will most likely not be able to connect, but there are work arounds, there is a custom made launcher that will force launch the game without bothering with server connection.Well; I guess, since Valve has finally added a refund method, if you think the game seems fun, buy it, download it, attempt to get the custom launcher to work, and if you can play singleplayer without issues, then I say; Go for it; cause you know now, if you don't find enjoyment of the game in its current state, you can get a refund for it. (Just don't play for more than 30 minutes in total)			"

Tdu2 'a world in a game', a game that many people have called terrible, (maybe they need to try a bit more with happy face, maybe try more, persist, and learn it.)

Hurray! ---Atari broke my Steam Tdu2 last July 23rd 2013. no support atari said tell Steam, Steam said go tell Atari. So I had to buy it again, I now play in retail Tdu2, same game but play hours are not recorded.Tdu2 single player is [imho] 95% at super excellent; more after my word on multiplayer.TDU2 had its multiplayer peak in 2011 [2,000 average number of players online each day] and was excellent and seamless join from singleplay and support was good. Since then Atari went broke, sacked its Eden devs and try to maintain and code and 'update' it by themselves and they have failed  breaking much of the multi and have even broken some of the login process and Uplauncher. Support is not much after 3 years.  Many forum posts complain about not being able to get past the uplauncher into the multi game. If you do manage to set router firewall exceptions for port 8889 and 3478 [not so simple] then you will mostly get into multi ok and all will be good. Backup your Savegame every day.. that's Documents\Eden Games. Copy the whole folder, find a safe place on other drive, create a new folder, name it as e.g. 'May12-ellie-lev22' Open it, and Paste in there. Ok. Do that every day, make new folder each time with new name, e.g. 'May13-ellie....etc. after a week you have 7 backups of your Eden Games, you can delete the oldest one, you still got 6. My backup folder, if it gets more than 50 in it I delete a few, but I always keep the most recent 5.  If your Tdu2 gives error or crashes, go Documents, Cut the Eden Games folder, Paste it to Desktop, Open the recent backup folder you made, Copy  (not Cut) that Eden Games folder and Paste it in Documents. Run Uplauncher all good say Hurray for backup, delete that bad Eden from Desktop, go Play. If still fail ask for helps.Thanks for reading. Have fun! Thanks Atari Eden for creating Tdu2.			"

												Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: SecuROM™4 machine activation limitThe issue isn't with Securom it's self, With other Securom games at least if you lose an activation in a month you can get it back, NOT this game!Thats the biggest down fall, and YOU can lose an activation if you upgrade your Video card, it happened to me.If you lose all 4 the game won't work. Thanks Atari. Clowns!Apart from that its a great game, but the wheel support is crappy. And the cars feel like you're driving on ice.			"

												A terribly flawed game. Graphics were dated, even upon release. The car handling is vague and unresponsive, even on hardcore mode. The story is awful. The character models and voice acting is even worse. The car list is diverse if you enjoy European cars, but terribly lacking for Japanese and American models. Buying cars can be a grinding task of repetition. Buying houses is worse. There are countless glitches. Online support ceased years ago.However, even will all it's flaws, I this is still one of my favorite games. The expansive roads of Ibiza AND Oahu are amazing. 2 massive islands that will takes you countless hours to explore. The maps are really the key gameplay elements. Once you adjust to the vague controls, there is a true sense of speed when cruising through the mountains, or beaches, or canyons, or through the city. Though games like Forza Horizon do offer a better overall experiance. TDU2 offers true driving freedom.  Even with the dated graphics, this game can be truely beautiful. With all the houses and cars on offer, this will give an avid car fan who needs to collect everything hours upon hours of fun.Ignore the garbage story, accept the dated graphics, adapt to the steering ambiguity, and you have one of the most fun sandbox driving games available.

												Truely one of the best games apart from some faults. It is know that this game wasn't tested properly before launch and atari even released some free DLC to compensate for that but the truth is that the AI is horrible, the police chase mode is dreadful and the god damn license tests annoying. What this game does good however is cruising with friends or alone. And it does it damn well. The cars are lovely, the graphics maybe a little outdated but not bad at all and the island large enough for hours of exploring and fun. If you're ooking for an actual racing simulator go elsewhere. This is more of an arcadish casual driving game. Personally i enjoy the off-roading the most. Going 250km/h in a beautiful Mercedes ML63 AMG on the dirt drifiting around a corner is fun.Do note that eden games (the creator of this game) is gone so theres no more support for it really. And the servers tend to go down at times. Great game, worth the money. Can't wait for a newer game like this.			"

												Hello and welcome to my review of the relatively old game Test Drive Unlimited 2.I am aware of the fact that the game was released in 2011, I've purchased it in 2013 and I will still review this title because the series are discontinued and I do still enjoy the game untill today.Now something about me regarding the racing genre on PC.I do not like racing games where you can race on a track, in a car which is almost unhandle-able ( in my opinion, ofcourse ).With these games I mean Grid, and partially Dirt.Okay, I did enjoy Dirt 3 and Dirt Showdown without a doubt but in the end, playing with a controller or a steering wheel, it didn't satisfy me enough to keep me playing these titles once in a week or more often.So now back to what I do enjoy in a game of the racing genre.I do really like the open-world idea, having a big map or several maps ( In Test Drive's case: Island ).Driving around without anything forcing you do to anything, making speed and just drive all across the island on various landscapes with a nice sight does satisfiy me.Buying a relaxing car, my Ferrari 458 Italia, Purple with black rims in this case: And just cruising around the island, on the roads with water to the right of me and the city to the left of me, hearing the engine doing it's work is what I like.Not being forced to drive a track, do a race and aiming on finishing first without anything else you can do.Just free-roaming in open worlds with customizable cars which you can upgrade and adjust to any specification you want.And that's for the driving part, now for the experience in terms of sound.The sound of the car, in various situations ( Driving in sand, dirt, or just a normal road ).The sound is different every time, for every car in any situations ( weather too for example ) is just perfect in the game and these small things help me enjoy the game more than I already did.Driving through a tunnel while It's raining in my custom white Nissan GT-R is what I can't do in any other game.And these elements of Test Drive is what makes me want to play the game, the endless options to tune and adjust cars to exactly how I'd like to and then going on the road, hearing the right sound and feeling good when playing the game .. Yeah, that;Now for the other part of the game:Missions, Money, Houses and avatar.Missions in Test Drive are tasks you have to complete which can be anything from getting a high adrenaline bar, but also could be driving above a certain speed and also opposite missions like driving really careful without the person next to you in the car getting sick.These missions are pretty fun for the first few times but become boring quick, but they reward you with money to buy cars, houses and clothing.Money in the game is pretty important ofcourse but I feel like you just have to keep grinding the repetitive missions to finally buy the car you have been wanting for a while.So yeah, the method of money making within the game is something I don't like and that made me want to Cheatengine myself a couple houndred million instead of working for the money I want to buy the car I'd like.Houses and Avatar: Besides the garage part to store your cars, I don't care about Houses or pimping your avatar ( Buying clothes, getting haircuts, etc ).So yup, the car driving part is what I like the most of the game.Okay, for some of you I might have not played the game in the right way, or not long enough but this was my final review of the game.If I had to give the game a score from 0 to 100 I would give it a 85, some aspects could've been done way better ( Money making and missions ) but the driving itself is what makes the game a good open-world cruising game, and pretty unique in it's genre.Okay okay, Grand Theft Auto is somewhat more bigger and to some also better but what I care about is the car driving.In Grand Theft Auto the car driving is only fun when stunting and such with your friends.So that's it for the review guys, I hope you have enjoyed reading my opinion about this game.

												Great game, game honestly gets boring after time but it keeps you occupied that is for sureOk what’s included in this review: Servers, Windows 10 Support!Servers; those of you who say the Servers are down:1. Check server status and the store News page in case there are any issues.No issues?- If you can find 0 issues then it is more than likely the ports are being blocked somewhere, it’s actually really easy to tell if the ports are being blocked! The launcher tells you this! If the ports are blocked the text above the loader bar will be in red; if it is in RED then please search up on Google on how to open TDU2 ports (Skill Level: Moderate), this should take you no longer than 10 minutes to do this TIP: try portforward.com they have a really handy tool that helps you get started.If you know the ports are open inside your router, it’s time you checked your firewalls! If you have windows firewall (as rubbish as it is) you need to allow the application access to the internet usually automatically prompts you to do this on first launch, secondly you need to free up the TDU’s ports as well.Ok when you launch the game the launcher will come up, if you still see the RED text then don’t worry it’s just a minor bug; all you need to do is close the launcher and re-open the game (this may take a few attempts) you are looking for GREEN text, if you have tried at least 10 times:Firstly restart your Router and your PC then revert to the above ^^ statement.Windows 10:Windows 10 at first load up appears that it does not support the game; It pops up with the readme.htm file telling you that the game is not supported, however there is a way around this! First of all close the game.-- Those of you who do not know what Troubleshooting compatibility is, search up for some helpful tips on Google! :) –- Yes you guessed it! You are going to be using Compatibility to get the game working, note: you only need to do this once!Firstly: goto your game library, locate TDU2, right click the game and select Properties, goto the Local files tab, click Browse local filesSecondly: Locate these 2 files: TestDrive2.exe and UpLauncher.exe. Right-click each one separately, click on “Troubleshoot Compatibility”, click “Troubleshoot program”, check “The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won’t install or run now” -> click next, Select Windows 8 -> click Next, click “Test the program...” (needed to save the new settings) -> close the app after it opens -> Click next, click “Yes, save the settings for this program” -> Click “Close”. Repeat this for the other “EXE”, now you are done! Re-launch the game normally from steam and have fun!Please rate my comment up if this helped you :)*edit: noticed the link I provided was erm? wrong? oops, sorted :D			"

												Edit : People reported having more issues on key validation/connection than usual!TDU2 is a fine racing game, there is a great amount of vehicles and stunning visuals set on Hawaii and Ibiza, shops to explore, items to buy, reputation to earn and it has somehow a social-racing experience. Singleplayer quickly puts you up to task, teaching you how the system works: get licenses, complete races, get cars, customize cars, complete championships, buy houses, buy furniture, get bigger garages and then buy more cars. The map is huge, its fun to explore, Hell!, its fun to just pick a random car and drive around the island, for some it's even therapy and it works just fine!...at least the singleplayer.Multiplayer mode is not so multiplayer, constant connection problems logs you out of the game, some players might have their cars shaking on your screen due to connection issues, and 'clubs' which are the ""guilds"" in this racing game, as mostly not used by anyone, believe me... I've tried.After learning not to mind the bad physic system and buying an Xbox Controller so I could play it not so terribly, I find myself enjoying this game very much, there is even a chasing mode which reminded me of the old need for speed games.Once again, It's a fine game, despite its flaws, I do recommend Test Drive Unlimited 2 for any racing games lover.tl;dr+ Great amount of vehicles+ Huge map, fun to explore+ Immserive Atmosphere+ Plenty of things to do- Bikes are DLC only- Connection and launcher problems- Driving physics feel clumsy- Menus for social interactions are not user-friendly			"

												i really wanted to write a review about this much earlier... but i got so hooked on this game that i have to do that now.first of all, i read many of the reviews before i finally bought this game, many people complained about that its too unrealistic.well, its in fact not a racing simulator, nor a driving simulator, and its hard for me to find a correct description for it.the car handling is a bit like at ""grand theft auto"", or the older ""need for speed"" games.just imagine two giant gaming worlds, filled with streets, offroad tracks and a beautiful landscape, detailed cities and viliages, where you can drive 100% freely, without any pressure.all original licensed cars and motorbikes, , no fantasy vehicles!you can go to different driving schools,  learn to handle normal street cars, supersport cars, offroad cars or oldtimers, step by step, afterwards you can participate in races in those vehicle classes.you can provoke the police for car chases.if youre not a fan of this, doesnt matter, you can also just buy vehicles, drive around, for HOURS over hours, discover many awesome places. you can discover hidden treasures, in form of special cars, you can buy houses and decorate them, buy clothes for your avatar, change it's hair and body,  you can paint, wash, tune your cars and bikes... you can crash into other cars, see them lose control :D(the game has a nice,COSMETIC car damage modelling. a damaged car looks bad, but there is no handling change!)you can drive online together with friends or many other people, invite them to cruise around, to races, or create car clubs with them, or just goof along with your cars.as additional feature there is also a casino where you can play poker or roulette against other human players, or alone at the slotmachine.what did i forget? probably a lot, since the game offers such an incredible range of features...best for me are the little niceties, like the possibility to open and close the roof of your cabriolet, to open and close the car door windows, to switch on/off the indicators, that the radio adjusts the volume while the navigation system gives instructions... some other things that might be good to know: the graphics look fine, the sounds are good, the voiceacting is moderate, there is not much of a story, there are two in car radiostations 1.rock and 2. a mixxed playist of hiphop/trance/house/pop/rock, you can chat with other people easily.bad things: -i lost the connection a few times, sometimes i can just rejoin my friends, other times i have to close and start the game again to make it working.  -sometimes the online servers are completly down, (but you can still play in offline mode!)- there are many different ai driven vehicles, but no npcs walking on the streets-the AI is not that smart.last but not least: ITS IMPORTANT TO GET A GAMEPAD/CONTROLLER FOR THIS! keyboard is possible, but not really fun, in my eyes.really sad that i havent tried this game much earlier already, its fantastic and really addicting.its a 100% must buy, even if youre like me, not a big racing fan at all.

												As my car hurtles over the tallest cliff in Hawaii, I take one last look in the rear-view mirror. How did it come to this? For the longest time I was just another loser, content with a mundane life and those brief moments of escapism. Somehow over the course of nearly 30 hours in Test Drive Unlimited 2, I became a monster. Sometimes when people play videogames, it's to get away, like a virtual vacation. But there are those times, where I don't want to be a plumber, a rodent with an attitude, a criminal, or Laura Bailey. I just want to drive around in expensive automobiles. In the real world I own two cars, one of them has a busted alternator. The other? No brakes. Despite being unable to start or stop, I've maintained the same driving job for the past decade. I'm always driving through the same neighborhoods meeting the same people every moment of every day. On top of all that, if Florida is considered America's ♥♥♥♥, then I live in one of its hemorrhoids. But hey, all I need is an hour or two a day of wonderfully escapist adventures and I'm golden.I was a fan of Test Drive Unlimited 1 on the Xbox 360. The handling wasn't particularly good, but the atmosphere and sense of exploration was excellent. With a few fixes, better graphics, and more content, it could be my ideal driving game. I'm not sure what I was expecting with the sequel. I read all of the reviews, noted that there are major problems such as Securom, dysfunctional servers, and so on. I considered the possibility that this game might not even work. But I gave it a shot anyway......I'm at a party...alright..cool I guess. Apparently I'm a woman now. It's just like Skyrim except I'm wearing clothes and I don't think I have a six-foot-long p-.""PepsimanVsJoe! Enjoying your birthday party?""Oh It's my birthday? I had no idea. Apparently I'm a silent-protagonist so all I can do is smile.""Come check out your gift! It's a brand new car!""No way! This is one of those end-game vehicles. I must be dreaming. This is so totally meta.Sure enough the real game begins, I lose my job, only to get an offer to join a racing group for some show called Solar Crown. This is so ridiculous. I head to the used car dealer for my first actual virtual vehicle. ""HOLY ♥♥♥♥!"" I say to myself.The dealer? He has small hands. The driving school instructor? A regular Alex Smith. It's no wonder none of them have gone for a handshake, it would be like if I held up my finger so a baby could grab it. After sleep-driving through my first test I say ""Thank you very much."" to the instructor. Apparently I'm a very-thankful-and-not-quite-silent protagonist. The only words I ever say are to express gratitude. On the road, the handling is...well it's about as bad as TDU1. In my mind that's good enough, because I'm finally living the dream again, cruising through hundreds of miles of beautiful Ibiza, and eventually Hawaii. As with the previous game, everyone needs help getting around the islands. There's the drunk guy who wants me to speed, the sick girls that throw up if I slam on the brakes, the random woman who always calls me adorable, and...wait a minute. It's happening again isn't it? The same people, requesting me to do the same favors for them over and over. Don't they have anything to say? While I'm driving we could discuss those bonus features on DVDs, or what tiny-handed men are good for aside from making origami birds out of starburst wrappers. Instead it's always ""I'm going to be late!"" or ""I just broke a nail"" or ""Whoa ho! Look at that speed!""The people I compete with are slightly more developed, but it's also a facade. Miami Harris is little more than an untimely Paris Hilton joke. Then there's the Wilder brothers. Oh look at us! We're so extreme...ly shallow! Tess Wintory never figures out her daddy issues. Her dad Stuart is just a useless old prick. If I'm expected to race against these jerks all the time, at least a little effort could have been expended to develop them. But who am I to talk? I have the least character development of all. Oh sure, I've bought several houses, over a dozen cars, and a couple wardrobes. I've also gotten plastic surgery so many times I've forgotten what I originally looked like. In fact I just got some work done earlier today. The nose wasn't right.Aside from a few minor changes and additions, TDU2 isn't really much of a sequel. In some ways it's even a step back. Motorcycles are locked behind a DLC wall. The races are organized in a Grand Prix setup, with the winner being the person who attains the most points. However that model is dumped for the major championships races because....???? It doesn't make any sense. A casino would have been nice to hang out at, but that's also DLC. All of the other additions seem to be multiplayer-centric, which is pointless when half the people that buy this game can't even get it to work.But does any of that truly matter to me? I got what I wanted right? My virtual fantasy of owning expensive cars, several houses (that I can't interact with), and free reign over a beautiful...but lifeless island. Lifeless except for the same 12-15 idiots who sit around impotently while I drive them around or beat them to the ground in the championships. Nearly 30 hours of this dream has become a nightmare, and I suspect that it won't end anytime soon.So where we did leave off? Oh right...I was hurtling over the tallest cliff in Hawaii. Yes, I'm throwing it all away. Soon it will all be-I hit the rocks, then the water...suddenly I'm back on the road again...my car is a little scratched but it isn't even wet. I knew it wouldn't work anyway, but can you blame me for trying? It's that time again. I remove the bandages from my last trip under the knife and check the rear-view mirror. The nose still isn't right.			"

												I've poured a significant chunk of time into this game, and as far as I can tell, it was all a bit of a waste.This game appears, from the screenshots and trailer, to be a relatively straightforward driving sim, with an ambitious goal of giving you hundreds of kilometers of road to drive on, and loads of cars. It certainly delivers on giving you a beautiful and detailed set of cars (There's geometry in the stitched leather of my Alfa Romeo's dashboard, for goodness' sake!), and an enormous amount of road to play with them on.Unfortunately, it suffers in a few fairly glaring areas.Area 1: Voice ""Acting""There is a serious problem with the way the voice actors were either directed or hired, as the voice acting cannot be more irritating, repetitive and off-key. The dialogue is pretty awful, and the ""story"" which attempts to make an excuse for you entering loads of ""championships"" consisting of the same eight or so opponents would have been better off dropped from the game.(Additionally, if you don't play with a male character, prepare to be perpetually misgendered as they only recorded dialogue using masculine pronouns.)Area 2: DLC HellThe game is littered with ""DLC"" cars which you can gawk at in full detail, get in, and test drive, but which, as far as I can tell, cost Atari Points to unlock the privilege of purchasing with in-game currency. Good work guys.Also, about 40% of the customisation options for your character, houses and vehicles are literally unrelated Atari logos and trademarks. What a load of crap.Area 3: PhysicsI wouldn't call myself an expert in car handling or physics, I don't have real-life racing experience, the closest I could say I've come is playing a reasonable amount of Gran Turismo, and driving a fairly mundane vehicle around city streets IRL, but to call the physics in Test Drive Unlimited 2 uninviting would be an understatement.So yes, I'm expecting some oversteer and some understeer, maybe if I turn driving aids off I'm expecting to have to pay a little more attention to how I accelerate and steer. Fine.But don't make a game where the vehicle's reaction to the road seems to be dependent on my camera position. Cars have literally flipped backwards after a crest when in cockpit camera, but don't do so from behind. I can only assume that it puts priority on physics objects which are in your view? Makes no damned sense.Likewise, cars feel very detached from the road. There's a definite difference in grip between bitumen and grass, which is fair enough, but cars still slide (forwards) on the tarmac. There's also a ""bonus"" system for ""drifting"", though ""drifting"" doesn't appear to actually be possible due to the game's physics setup. I gave up on that mechanic.Area 4: AIWhen in a time trial style event, with just your vehicle on the track, the time to beat is just barely attainable if you make 0 mistakes, and pretty much impossible if you mess up even once.Meanwhile, in a race with multiple vehicles on the road, your opponents drive like your grandmother going to pick up groceries. They weave in and out of corners in a perfect row with no apparent intent to win. If you do get ahead of them, you can simply slow down in front of them, they won't attempt to overtake and break their racing line at all. Completely stupid. If you're going to ask me to win races, at least make it a challenge rather than wasting my time like this.ConclusionFriends don't let friends buy Atari products.How I Played* Female Character* Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller with genuine Microsoft controller adaptor* @1920x1200 on a GTX260 (Earlier)* @2560x1440 on a GTX670* Did not purchase any offered DLC* Attempted to use the Unofficial Patch, but unpacking negatively affected ongoing game performance			"

												I have played over 500 hours on this game on the 360 and i dont regret any of those hours, as this is my favourite game ever made, but dont get me wrong, there are some downsides to it.Lets jump straight into the pros and cons. Pros:1: Extensive and engaging storyline.2: Very good soical racer in its time.3: Lots of things to do after you have completed the storyline, with friends or without friends. 4: An insane amount of cars.5: An installable ""Unoffical Patch"" that grants you even more cars.6: MASSIVE open world all there for the taking7: In its time it had a great community. Cons: 1: Impossible for new players, as registering an account is very difficult, and if you are on windows 10, theres a 50/50 chance you will or will not be able to play. 2: Atari and Eden games were dead many years ago, so dont expect any new updates or customer support. 3: No email verification, so if you forget your password, your save data and your entire account are done for. 4: Some glitches and bugs that can be frustrating, but do not happen very often. 5: Pretty hefty price tag for a game that is this old and may or may not work. 6: Graphics are very outdated, but that is to be expected from a early 2011 game. 7: Servers that are practically dead, in my past few days of playing i have not found one online player, which is very frustrating in my opinion. Sugguestions to beat the cons:1: DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE ON WINDOWS 10, and research on a way to make an account, im sure there is a way.  2: Install the unoffical patch, as this grants many new cars to play around with. 3: Write your password down. 4: If these glitches do happen, for example hitting a stop sign in some areas will flip your car, do not get frustrated! You can always dodge or overcome these glitches. 5: Buy this game when it is on sale. It goes down to around 4.99 USD occaisonally.6: Not really a fix for this one, but maybe there is some kind of mod out there that can give you a better graphics experience. 7: Find some friends that are playing! Post in the community discussions and look for people that are already playing the game. Overall, this is my favourite game ever made. If one day i become a billionare, i am going to buy out atari and eden games and make a tdu3. Thanks for reading and i hope this helped you make your decision on whether to buy the game or not.			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 is no doubt single handedly one of the most action packed racing games of all time.TDU 2 has forever been one of my most favourite games, and is no doubt the best racing game in my eyes, with the game allowing the player to own a House / Apartment / Yacht, giving you the option to customize depending on the price. Giving the player the right to have their own personal racer in which they are also able to customize almost every part of the entity, skin colour, clothes, looks etc. Giving the player the ability to switch between two islands giving the player a massive open world to have fun with friends. However, this game does have its flaws.The biggest flaw is the games servers, soemtimes they may be down, in which this happening can prevent the player from doing certain things, such as: Taking a picture of your virtual character and posting it so everybody can see what your character looks like. Restrict you from playing online even though you are connected to a internet connection. Stop you from entering clubs. etc.Although even though this games may have it's flaws, it will always go down as one of the most epic racing games of all time, and I don't think that anybody is able to disagree with me on that one.

												Despite how badly they ♥♥♥♥ed the physics in this game, and how cheesy the acting and all that is with the whole Solar Crown story line (I mean WTF really), I actually really enjoy this game and still play it religiously thanks to modders who created the Unoffical Patch and also the new AutoPack mods + Dreampack. Without these this game would have died for me long ago. There is nothing quite like jumping in any one of a big lineup of lovely motor vehicles and cruising around to your own content. As much fiddling as it is to set up, I'd recommened you only play this with a wheel, other NFS would be more your speed. Police chases in this game are not fun.			"

												TDU2. I'll Just get to the point and use the pro/con format. At the end I'll make observations and make an summation.Pros. 1. Attention to detail was given to layout* and overall very detailed citys and villages including ancient ruins with no purpose but as a nice touch. 2. Behavior of npc opponents during races  created challenge. 3. A large selection of vechicles was available. 4. RPG features such as clothing/car appearence and preformance/housing/player alteration was abundant. 5. Basic driving fundamentals (driving schools) available and mandatory to advance. Cons. 1. Layout* and NPC behavior. While driving around ""most"" any curve while offroad at moderately high speed and you want to get sideways a bit? Rest assured that your entrance and exit of the curve has been carefully calculated and a tree has been placed at the exact center of your exit position and sometimes 2 to catch you just in case you swerve away from the first. Want to cut corners where you wish? No. You'll find carefully placed trees at most curves. Think you're clearing that tree? Nope. Suddenly you've rammed that tree head on exactly centered by your vechicle. You'll cut corners where you're allowed to and only in matches where they're obvious to the player. 2. NPC driving behavior.  While driving an 4 lane highway your forced to drive on the shoulder because as you approach 2 npc vechicles one will speed to tandem with the other closing an opening that you saw from a distance. Also say you're in an eight lane highway and want to open up the throttle? No. If any vechicle exists in the road ahead it will change lanes to be in yours.  Its 2 am in the middle of nowhere and you get a lead foot?  Vechicles will pop into existence before your very eyes in both lanes.Approaching an intersection at high speed? cars will race to block sometimes intersecting and crashing while you're attempting to navigate. Driving through the mountains? And approaching a curve?  NPC vechicles will pop into existance race to the curve to beat you there then slow down to 20 mph entering the curve. You want to pass on a curve but dont want to use the shoulder? Consider that all curves are completely blind to you and that an NPC vechicle will pop into existance in the opposing lane as you pass. Want to get close to the vechicle in front of you to get a good passing position? It will slam on the brakes. 2. Graphics.  Microstuttering, visible jerking, tearing of the world ahead. Also textures blinking in and out of existence on NPC vechicles. And no its not my computer. It can handle Planetside 2 at 60 fps no problem.3. NPC while out of vechicles look worse than any in half-life 2 ever did.4. Voice acting that that never varies and grates the nerves.5. Want to use a keyboard to navigate? Hehe.6. Getting some progress in the game? Nope your save game in corrupted.7. Want to play online? Ha ha...8. Need support? (see above)9. Waiting for an update. (see above X2)10.  Want a certain car? Tough luck, its DLC.While fun can be had it seems engineered to annoy the player enough to quit playing while making a DLC purchase at the same exact moment.			"

												TDU2 has two very major and unsolvable problems:1. The physics are just terrible. This is not even a matter for debate- check any review from when this was released. Regardless of of car class or cost, the cars handle poorly in general and have an unreasonable tendency to easily spin out of control even on dry roads.2. Server Authentication. TDU2 has 'online' and 'offline' player profiles- think Diablo 2 with offline and Battle.net characters. These are completely separate saves and you cannot transfer progression from one to the other. The problem is, the Online Servers are constantly down for PC, meaning you cannot use your Online profile. Not only that, but around 25% of the game's content is only available with an Online profile. This is really a dealbreaker.			"

												Well what makes me come back to this game time and again? Interesting story... no, great driving physics...no, interesting characters.. dont let me start on that, voice acting?.. you could say that if you were entertained by the repeating announcement that apparently the Wilder brother are squabbling with Stewart again (who-tf is Stewart I can only guess). However this game has something. You have you car and the freedom to travel around two islands full of nice sights and sunny vistas. You can drive for hours, buy cars, houses or just explore at your leasure.  You can challenge other people whos worlds seamlesly intersect with yours like in Dark Souls. Or you can explore the world without invisible bounds around the roads, a bit like Skyrim in Cars. But even if you stop, the environment doesn't look as generic as for example in Need for Speed or Driver series, so you are really motivated to visit new places.The graphics are great, there is a weather and day/night cycle. The views you get out of some of your Flats/Houses are amasing. The challenges a varied and exciting. There are also a pair of races around the Island, that can take nearly a real-world hour to complete. I mean if I think about it a bit more, this game is the opposite of what I really don't like about other racing games whith dumb driving on the same track over and over again with an extreme example being american Nascar where you just drive in a circle.Sure the characters look like dorks and sound even worse, but then you see the attention do detail the developers put into the game and it's amazing.  Just try to explore the starting location. You will not see it any more after the first minute or so in-game but the effort put into it speaks for itself. If you take your time and look around at the nicely textured babes, whose breast actually bounce around a bit (in a racing game!), the bar with actually some bottles stuffed behind the counter, then you really get into this holiday Ibiza mood. Did I mention  I really appreciate that detail? There are also many cars each with detailed interior, which you can admire.This game however is not without its (many) problems, to name a few:- the characters are just plain silly and the story even more so- you have to set the controls just so, or the driving experience will be awfull- the driving physics could be much better (I miss dirt 2)- there are no pedestrians (to drive over :)  ) anywhere!- the developer is not in business any moreWell thats my 2c, you can get this game really cheap for less tha $10 on steamtrades, so if you just like to drive around, explore and do an occasional race, this is a game for you!P.S. The Characters in this game are ridiculous and remind me of mega shark vs giant octopus movie. They either creep you out, like the same guy you pick at 2 am in car who is ""late for his meeting"" or make you laugh hystericly because their dialogs dont correspond with the situation at hand.Also I think this game in not effectively playable with a keyboard. There are some challenges, you have to complete for a Driving License with a ridiculously volatile car named Dodge Viper, where accelerating a bit too much or steering to far will make it spin uncontrollably.

												In my opinion, it's one of the best racing games out there. It perfectly combines concepts of racing with open-world style games.+ very nice graphics for a 2011 game+ huge open-world, maybe a bit too huge if you want to hit that 100% road discovery+ many extra stuff on top of actual racing (like car-wrecks, photo-locations, a bit of tuning, avatar customization, and much more)+ car control is awesome using a keyboard- all multiplayer races/features are unavailable, so it's single player only- some bugs here-and-there, but nothing too scary- given its age (6 years) and multiplayer unavailablity, asking 20 euros for it (at the time I'm writing this) is a bit too much.

												This is my first game review on Steam. TDU2 is my favourite open world driving game, it's not just about racing. It's like a luxury lifestyle sim, it's incredible and there's no other car game like this! It does lack proper driving physics and bad servers but mainly a positive game. I do sometimes have problems launching the Steam version of this game after clicking Play but at least my retail one works well. Been having NAT issues recently which is another negative. Also hope the servers will stay up for longer. Still enjoy TDU2 though, Logitech G27 Racing Wheel works great with the game and playing online is of course more fun but offline isn't bad either. Old is gold!			"

												I can't really recommend this game nor I can say it's bad.Atari is the worst thing happened to this game but it's so good I just can't press that ""Dislike"" button.I may have played only 79+ hours but this game is amazing. All the time I had with my buddies meeting up in middle of Hawaii and driving around, doing stunts and just having fun. Me with my Audi R8, which I still absolutely love, others with Nissan GT-R, Bikes etc. It was one of the greatest times I have ever had in games. Ever. Speeding through the city with 355km/h while others trying to catch you or the other way. Drifting, random races with other players. This game is AMAZING. Too bad Atari is killing it. It's really a shame. I just lost my profile because I installed Windows 10(clean install) and as it turns out Atari doesn't save your info on their servers but I don't even mind it because this game is THIS fun. Anyway, if you EVER decide to buy this game make sure you are patient, either Atari is going to fix their mistake or someone will, for sure, make private server and we'll race again.			"

												Why get this buggy, never to be updated driving game you may wonder. This is why I say yes in a simplistic -List.Pros-Variety of cars/bikes from Mustangs to Ferrari to Harley Davidson.-Decent Graphics for a driving game of its nature.-RPG Elements. Houses you can customize, a comprehendable profile system, Club Houses, clothes and more.-Two Very Big and good looking Islands with plenty of roads and things to discover.(On that note)-More things to do than just drive against ai. Integrated SP and MP for those who like MP. Public Challenges, Clubs, car wrecks  you can salvage. photo missions, Casino if you get the dlc, decent player interaction, are just a few of the things.-Easy to progress and somewhat ok support for wheels, controllers etc. (Friends XboX 1 Controller Works with this for example)Cons-No developer to update anymore-Registering on the game website and getting Atari Tokes for DLC can be a pain-Glitches and Speed Hackers-From what I hear unstable servers(Never Experinced Myself)-Confusing Police-Some graphical bugs for some(Pink Skid Marks for example)-And a few minor other things that bugs me but does not stop the flow of this gameAll In All I highly enjoy this game and suggest everyone at leasts watches some videos of this game on youtube and go with the open mind that people can exagerate problems (Pro or Con) and give this game a chance. You more than likely  will not regret it. As for comparisons to The Crew. Even though this games developers are included they are 2 Different games and I will play both in the future. If your still skeptical, wait for a steam sale, game gets decently cheap. Happy driving! See you on the street!			"

												I sat through the game for 5.6 hrs, in the first sitting. And to all the Negitive reviews saying the servers are down, there not. i drove past tons of people. one person even challenged me to a race.It also launches fine on Windows 10 for me, tons of realistic cars (the ones u get in real life lol) steering took some time to get used to, but changing to ""sport"" physics seem to help quite a bit. However, i would not recommend with a keyboard and mouse controlls. (feels weird).I use my PS4 controller with DS4 to emulate a Xbox 360 controller. Game has support for other controllers as well.http://ds4windows.com/ - This is for the Windows Ver. of DS4.

 - Tutorial i followed for DS4. (This is actually quite an old vid, DS4 has been updated since then.

How you can interact with the cars, etc.best 5.6 hrs of my Gaming Life, More Review will come when I progress further into the game ^, Reason being you can not get to the 2nd island (Hawaii) without completing Ibizia first. My system isent powerful at all (AMD athlon || X4, Radeon HD 5670, 3 gigs of ddr3) works like a dream on all medium settings 1600 x 900.I currently would give this game solid 10/10.			"

												Though this game is old ( 2011 ) then it is absolutely amazing and beautifull. You get two huge islands to drive on from a-b and race allot of races to earn fame money and glory. You first advance to the new island once you won some races and unlocked it, and the second island is much larger than the first, and if I remember correctly it is the island from test drive unlimited 1.. but very cool and beautifull map.As game progesses you can buy houses and new tons of new cars, and yes you can even go to the casino and play if you feel like it.There is an option when you start the game to play in either offline or online mode.. I highly recommend to drive in the online mode since more options in the game will be avaliable.You can also always just avoid races with other people if you do not like to do so and still play the ""single player"" campaign while in the online mode.( I mostly played the non steam version and have completed the game several times over 100+ houres, bought it on steam on sale but have not played it much since then).

												It is a must buy!Well after 150 hours this game is still fun and enjoyable. If you can get past the bugs, hackers and strange physics you too can enjoy this fantastic open world driving experience. The near GPS perfect mapped roads of Hawaii and Ibiza mean there is plenty of places to drive and explore. The variety of cars is not to bad either. I it is a real shame the studio who made this game went bankrupt but at least the online servers still for now, although that means there is no chance of getting an official patch for this game now. If the physics, graphics or selection of cars is not to your liking then you can easily mod it to suit your needs, just whatever you do play OFFLINE! I personally enjoy just driving about the place with friends or other who I meet in game so have chosen to remove the mods.So if the price is too high for you liking then buy it in a sale, you won't be disappointed if you can look past the points I have mentioned.

												Game is pretty much unplayable.  Without the multiplayer servers being online you can't even get past the title screen.  You are stuck in an endless loop of error messages saying the servers are down.Can't even play single player without Atari's servers being up.  I wanted to come back and play the game again but I guess they gave up supporting it a couple years after release.  Would be nice if they released a patch so it could still be played in single player without needed the servers online.Defnitly do not buy the game currently as it is a complete waste of money since you can't play it at all.

												TLDR; Multiplayer DOES still function (for me anyway), Meh car handling, decent variety of cars, nice visuals, awful story & voice acting and 2 very large maps (takes about an hour to drive around them). 7 out of 10, ONLY BUY WHEN ON SALE FOR 75% OFFTest Drive Unlimited 2 is an open world driving game with a heavy emphasis on the ""super car"" lifestyle; collecting cars, houses and clothes and various other material possesions. There is a story but its so badly written and voice acted, you wont miss anything interesting if you choose to skip the cutscenes, it's just a weak excuse to have races across Ibiza and Hawaii. The actual racing itself is fairly arcadey, cars drift easily and generally don't have much feeling of weight but some simulation-ness is still present, of you mash the accelerator while drifting and you have the driving aids turned off you'll just spin out. The AI is fairly dumb in the early game, but it can get vaugely difficult when you're getting into the mid to late game. I can't speak about the multiplayer gameplay, but let it be known that IT DOES STILL WORK, just not that well and the multiplayer is on a ticking time bomb of whenever Atari decides to shut down support.Overall this game is worth a try if it's on sale and you like cars and you if can bully some friends to get it as well, you can get a fair bit of play time out of it.

												I've never played such a great racing game as tdu2. The physics aren't in arcade style like nfs games, and also not simulation, it is somewhere between. Every car handles different. There are more than 100 different vehicles (including dlc) and 3 dlc motorbikes. But tdu2 is not only racing game. You can explore 2 beautiful islands with hundreds of roads, socialize with friends and also visit a casino (dlc).

 Good Start , Bad End The game was released in 2011. I absolutley loved TDU1 ,so i decided to buy this one. At the start i was amazed.The Graphics , The Gameplay , The 2 Maps. Everything was great except my PC. Which could run the game with only 45 fps...The game started its lifetime very well. It had alot of cars, Great multiplayer/online , casino , appartments , garrages and all the stuff that one good open world racing game needs. 1 Year after release they announced  The Bike DLC . I was so excited about it. It came out and it was good. The problem was , that u had to buy every bike individually. On that time the multiplayer was working , singleplayer was great and everything was done well for this game so far. But then the problems came. Gameplay/AI The Gameplay/AI had few problems:  Driving Licenses , Cops and Controlls.   Driving License: The problem is that some of the challenges , are too hard to complete or even impossible for some players. Without Driver License u cant progress through the higher rank races.   Cops: Just like the Driver License , here with the cops ... its too hard to outrun them. I like challenges , but for some players this is hell. They are always stoped by the cops , no matter what they do.  Controlls: For the players with wheels this is not a problem. But for players who use keyboard its really hard to drive. In TDU1 was better optimized to drive with keyboard.  Community  Just like the most of the games , they have good community base behind them. There was great  Mods  released by the community moders. It added more cars , skins and everything that one mod can add to the game. But then some ""Bad Modders"" decided to ruin the fun for the most of the players. From this moment ...  The problems started  Late Multiplayer Problems and Site Problems/Closed Studio However , after the good start with the DLC's and Multiplayer , the problems kicked in.  ""The Bad Modders""  developed hacks. That ruined the multiplayer pretty much. For example u are driving Bugatti Veyron with 400 km/h and some guy with subaru drives by u with 500 km/h. It impossible.  Even after that , players were still playing the game.  However in 2014 the site was broken. New players couldn't register their accounts , so they couldn't even play the multiplayer. The multiplayer servers were down every week. It was unplayable. In later 2015 , Atari announced they are quiting TDU Studio. That was the end of TDU.  Overall  I dont recommend this game , even on sale. Its just not worth it. So many problems and bad gameplay. The only good  thing left from this game is the singleplayer mods. Developers did nothing , to even try to fix their game from the hackers.3/10 Not recommended NOTE: The servers may be still working , but its not worth it. U will get only bad server connection and u wont get any new content. Buy at your own risk.  "

												What to know about this game:- It's open world, and it's massive.- Feels like an MMORPG with cars.- Customizable characters, tune cars, create decals, discover locations, find hidden stuff, buy houses, etc.- Very immersive for people who like to cruise around in different cars and enjoy the scenery on the islands.- Freezes on Windows 10, how beautiful.Okay, this game runs flawlessly on Windows 7, no issues. I upgraded to Windows 10 a few weeks ago and tried playing this again with Nvidia surround everything on high at 5760x1080, it ran and eventually froze up after like 5 minutes. So I alt-tabbed and that did nothing, I had to hit ctrl-alt-delete and select task manager and I tried closing the TDU2 app, did nothing, tried bringing up the task manager, nothing. I actually had to sign out back to the login screen of Windows to stop the game and then log back in. So I followed some threads on here and tried lowering my settings and even ran the game at 1280x720, plays the game for about an hour and then freezes. I even turned on Nvidia adaptive V-Sync as recommended by others, and still nothing :DMy level of pisstocity at this point is through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ roof since this is literally one of my favorite racing games and now I can't even play the damn game because of this ""supposedly superb"" operating system. Windows 10 my ♥♥♥. This isn't the only game that acts up either, there are others. It's sad that I have to revert to the painful performance of the PS3 to play a game that I already paid for here on Steam. Yeah I know the game is ancient, but that doesn't justify the bs freezing going on. It would be nice if somebody made a fix for this game to run on Windows 10 without freezing / crashing, but I know it will never happen. With that being said, since I see it happening to a good number of people.... why even sell the game if it doesn't work?Insta-thumbs down. Such a shame because it's such an awesome game, but now it won't run for sht.Don't like the thumbs down?? Here's a band-aid.(funny thing is, I shouldn't be hating the game, but the operating system it's running on)*EDIT* 7/28/2016Come to find out it is because of an update built into Windows 10 named KB3086255 which disables Securom and Safedisc or whatever it's called, which is something that a lot of older games and physical discs used. They disabled it because apparently it can be used as a backdoor for hackers, etc. So the only way to get this game to work is to find a way to disable that, which would possibly leave your PC vulnerable, or dual boot Windows 7 to play this game on (AND AVOID THE KB3086255 UPDATE, which is still a risk I guess). I tested the game on Windows 7 again for more than 2 hours and the game ran completely fine, no problems, Nvidia Surround 5760x1080, everything on High, no freezing, no crashing, nothing. For all the ones out there who are having these issues, I hope I saved you a ton of headaches. Still a thumbs down though lol			"

												One of the greatest driving games, that sadly you may never play. I have owned this game a little over 3 weeks and have made/met 18 of the coolest friends in that short time plus an absolute bucket load of friends using the retail version. I'll cut to the bad news first. Firstly you have to make an account at http://www.testdriveunlimited2.com to be able to play this game and to buy DLC. Secondly, Eden games made this and unfortunately for what ever reson went belly-up. Atari luckily stepped in and took the game over but clearly they haven't got the server side stuff in control. This means you get things like:- Losing friends out of your profile and then sometimes they re-appear.- You can buy DLC and then have them turn into mardi gras pink mustangs ( no joke they are vehicles won through a one on one duel with a campaign progress character).-Some of the MMO aspects of the game fail or get broken regularly, meaning that you won't be able to find and join your buds or invite them to things like games in the casino or to your houses or for just a free-ride drive.- If you want to get the casino and or drive a range of cars and bikes you have to buy Atari points at the TDU2 website which is a turn off for many people to say the least because it can be tedious although myself, I never had any issues with it.The Casino DLC is $10AUD and cars work out to be $1AUD each @ $5AUD for 400 Atari points (Pay by Paypal for less hassle). These things are the worst parts of the game and some come and go as mentioned.Great things about the game:- You drive in an open world and work your way through getting licenses for different classes of vehicles and events on the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii. - Meet a lot of great people and make friends with people all over the world (personally I dont even have a problem with non english players) I just ask them, 'you use Steam? Add me as friend :)' even if they don't use the Steam version some make Steam accounts and add the game to non-Steam shortcuts. Then its easy, the add me and I have Google Translate open in the Steam in game browser so they can talk to me in their own language outside of in game chat, problem solved! :) - Did I mention Bikes? :D- Huge amount of Cars (some are DLC), unfortunately only 3 Bikes (DLC), huge array of clothing and customisations to your character by the use of plastic surgeon and to your cars by paintshops and tuning upgrades, a Casino and many properties that you can buy to house your vehicles. I totally dig the MMO aspect of this game even in it's breaks a lot state. The game graphics may not look as good as say Grid2 but that never bothered me, I like the open world aspect and MMO of the game. I've bought almost all the DLC for the game too because I think the game is worth it especially when you snag it for $5 and there are ways to deal with stuff when the Atari/TDUlife servers break etc like the Steam adding to compensate as I mentioned. Also I should mention that my X-Box controller works very well for me in this game and the game does support a fair amount of G' series wheels but you might want to Google the game to find out for sure if it supports yours.I dedicate this review to all the great people I have met in the game, they 'make' the game in my opinion. Also I'm going to put up some of the screenshots I have and will hopefully get the time to make a Youtube tribute to the game if not also my friends. It may be some time for TDU3 to come out and fingers crossed it will be for PC too. I won't wait around like I did getting this game I wished I'd bought it last Christmas. One other thing. Don't or avoid buying DLC vehicles (Google TDU2 DLC vehicles list so you know which they are) you didn't pay for with Atari points when the servers get attacked/modified and become unlocked to buy with just cash. You need to have unlocked them with Atari points in game and or purchased at the TDU2 website because at some stage they will revert to pink Mustangs only worth around $25k. $1.5 million exotic car turning into a $25k pink Mustang....not cool and you'll just be throwing in game cash away. Also, back your game save up periodically not that I've had any save game corruptions as of yet but there are many who claim they lost all they're game progress. The game saves literally everytime you go to the menu and when you quick travel so maybe that was fixed. Better to be safe than sorry I guess but to be honest I only started religiously backing them up when my Ducati that I legimately got with Atari points turned into a Mustang. Its not happened again with any other vehicle since and I did just rebuy it after selling the Mustang.			"

												Testdrive Unlimited 2 it's one of the best racing games out there, perfectly combines concepts of racing with open-world style games, still more could had been done to improve physics, but still a very solid game with everything combined. Good graphics Big open-world Extra missions (car wrecks, photo-locations, tuning) Multiplayer races and eventsThe only con i really dislike is, if you have purchased any DLC cars or other stuff, you have to backup your savegame files or you risk loosing everything, and that happens very often besides other bugs and server shutdowns once in while.Few bugs and crashesMultiplayer unavailablity sometimesPrice (its too much when some important features arent available all the time)			"

												Don't buy this game. The launcher is a broken mess and to make things worst, the main menu is bugged - You need to disconnect your internet to pass through the main menu so it sets you to 'offline' mode. There's also a fix you can download that by-passes the launcher so you get a slightly better experience. In 2014 this game was stable and everything ran smoothly and would've been 10/10. But now it's bearly playable. 0/10.P.S The pirate copy of this game has packed stable servers. -hint- -hint-.			"

												While I enjoy playing this Racing game, the lack of servers and steering wheel support makes what I'm sure was a good/great game upon release, fair to middling at best now. As others have stated the launcher takes an age to recognise that the servers are no longer available and this subsequently makes various achievements and areas of the game unavailable such as DLC and the in game casino.

												I have such mixed feelings about this game. The physics are weird; something close to simcade, but it's like the game doesn't know what it wants to be. The graphics are very lackluster with low-poly models, low-res textures, and crappy lighting. The voice acting is plain awful. The sound design is extremely weak. Test Drive Unlimited 2 screams ""low budget"" in every category you can judge it in. And despite all of that, it's extremely comfy. For anyone who's ever fantasized about living in the world of an arcade racer, it's all there. You buy dream houses so you can have enough space for all of your shiny supercars, then you take said supercars and hurtle them across two sun-soaked islands with complete freedom. It's just plain comfy. If that's the kind of racer you want, go ahead and pick this game up. It's jam-packed full of shortcomings and yet it's still able to hit a spot in your inner kid's heart that many other racers can't.			"

												Okay, so... Here's an honest review from a player since 2012 on PS3...When I first opened the box for my brand new PS3 title, TDU2, the servers were absolute crap. I took a while for Atari and Eden Games to get it back up. In my opinion though, the single player isn't much different and feels exactly the same. Although, you can't sync to a cloud or see real players and not AI. Anyway, this is PC MasterRace, so let's not get off topic...Regardless of that, here's my negatives... I think the physics could be a world better. This is basically my top priority for anyone who is continuing development, which leads me to say that the Test Drive series is apparently under new management by BigBen Studios, according to some website out there, just search it up to find it.Anyway, here's where I think Eden Games struck gold with the game... Textures, Shadows, Bloom Effects, gameplay, and the never ending list of vehicles. The visuals of the game are absolutely stunning for a 2011 game! Especially for the fact that it can literally run off of your average Dell PotatoBook (Random Number Goes Here for no G*d D*mn Reason)The game has a kind-of linear story behind it, (spoilers incoming) you are a valet who gets into a competition and basically gets rich when you win. You also meet some new characters along the way, and are able to discover things on your own via free-roam.The vehicles are ENDLESS! With even all the competition money you win, you can't even buy 1/10 of what the game has to offer! All the vehicles are high resolution textures and have the best reflectivity you will find from one of these games. The prices of vehicles are realistic as you would expect them to be in real life.Anyway, there is so much that this game has to offer! Look for sales and get the game as soon as possible. You will never regret the decision!10/10 -AjBrodsky			"

												It's like GTA, just without the guns and hookers. When you do pickup a drunk girl, you have to drive slowly so she doesn't throw up in your car. The girls that aren't drunk complain about breaking a fingernail when you drive badly. Unfortunately, you can't steal cars from the dealership, only test drive them; however, I guess that makes sense though, considering the name of the game.			"

Dlc in a game you can't even play most ofthe time because the servers are down. Also you can't purchase the dlc as it's only purchaseable with frickin Atari coins, which of course you get via their site. And the site is down. When finally some dude at atari decides to check the servers and put them online, the game is quite funand yeah when it was released it was great. But now? No. Just no. Atari doesn't give a damn about theirprior products and customers. So not recommended at all to buy now. Just because you can't play it half of the time.			"

												I wanted to love Test Drive Unlimited 1, but there were something missing about this game, hours spent in game untill servers were shut down on 9/29/2012 . Thats where TDU2 comes on. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. Doesn't it all sound fantastic? The ideas that went into Test Drive Unlimited 2 are appealing in every wayP.S. Over 1,5k hrs spent online,and once more unluck me website dont respond and not leting change password, nothing ealse but to buy new copy of game, #BackToGame As far as i see after 6 months breake SERVERS ARE STILL ON so feel free to buy the game, you'll never get bored.

												I love Driving Sims/Games, especially when I have a full racing setup with a Logitech G27 with the Stick Shifter, and a steering wheel mounted on an aluminum semi cage. Love playing this game with the setup and the force feedback makes it so much more realistic. I've also been lucky enough to have visited both islands in the game, and its close to the real thing, but of course they can't possibly recreate it to a T, but close enough to see some familiar roads and buildings.There's a good number of cars available in game, even motorcycles but only available as DLC which I don't think is up anymore for purchase. There are races to compete in, events to accomplish, and even getting your license on each category of cars. There's also 6 bonus cars that's hidden on both islands which you have to find, each car needs 10 parts in order to own them.I don't understand some people that complain about the graphics and other stuff, especially when the game was made in  2011 or earlier. It was made years ago, so of course due to the advancement of technology today would make it look dated. Don't give it a bad review just because you expect the game to look like todays current games. This goes across the board on all games in fact, reading all these negative reviews just doesn't give the game any justice at all.I really enjoy this game, an oldie but a goodie indeed.

												This is the closest thing to Forza Horizon on PC... for better or worse. And trust me, the worse is pretty bad. But first, the better.The game is spread across multiple hawaiian islands, in an open world campaign, which is pretty awesome. It also has a great selection of cars, missions, races and other things to participate in, such as painting your cars and altering your avatars appearance, clothing and hairstyle. So far, so good, the game really can be quite fun. I'd rate the physics as either one of the most realistic arcade games I've played, or one of the least realistic simcades I've played. But on to the negatives.The game rarely works without modification, I had to use a standalone launcher (which takes away my ability to gain Steam achievements) to make the game work consistantly. Even still, I can only play a couple hours before the game crashes. But really... I'm ok with that. I'll tell you now what really, truly infuriates me.There are certain timed missions in the game, that are absolutely, positively impossible to complete without driving like a balls to the wall, completely suicidal  lunatic. Take Mad Max style driving, and turn it up my 5. Then, add to that the fact that the most unpredictable traffic in the world is included, and the customer who's car you're delivering doesn't want it scratched, or driven off road, and welcome to the most utterly infuriating racing game ever known to man. I literally can't tell you the number of times that all I've needed to complete a mission is one more damn second, and everything would have been fine. But the game creators set time limits that apparently only God would be able to achieve, because not only must you be a driving god, you must also be the luckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ in the world for traffic not to cut you of and screw up your entire damn race.Now, I know the above paragraph is utterly critical, and even hateful of the game, but I still recommend it... especially on sale. I bought the game for $5, and I've gotten my moneys worth out of it already. I just really wish these particular missions were not made so freaking impossible. The other 95% of the game is fantastic, but that 5% of the games missions completely, and utterly infuriates me. Other than that (and the instability, and utter lack of reliable online support, and need to launch the game through a third party launcher) the game is pretty fun. Just be sure to pick up the universal launcher so you can play offline.http://i-knyazev.ru/tools/tdu2-universal-launcher/ "

												This game at release had so many issues. The fact is, this game looked great when viewing videos and screenshots or artwork. But when it came to playing the game, there was always something to bug you. After several patches leading upto the game before Atari shutdown teams that worked on such projects, the game slowly died but fan's tried hard to keep it a-float. Infact, the fan base was the only thing that kept this game alive.Now, the game is full of cheaters, hackers and modders. There is no technical support or admins. The hackers can ram you full speed and won't be knocked over, only you will go flying. Just one of the many bad things that commonly happen now. Oh, & thats if you're lucky enough to even get this game working. I bought this game for my friends, was it install & play? No, infact, it was so fustrating that both my friends gave up and only me and one friend got to truily test this game out.From my experience, the open world was a great idea, the level up system, cash system & club system was very exciting. All of this if you're lucky to get it to work. And if you can't get the launcher to do it's thing, the next big issue you'll probly have is registration and trying to connect to the server.I simply CANNOT say BUY this game, as it's not worth the hassle. I do say however, avoid at all costs. The game will soon be terminated and i'm glad I got to experience this game first hand before it turned to the largest pile of rubbish I've seen by far.Sound FX is good, only two radio stations and no custom radio support. (Fake radio stations) Graphics were also good for it's time. The first Person view is also nice. Some aspects really catch you're eyes and other aspect ruin you're experience completly.Now lets get to some more dirt. If you and a friend is lucky enough to even get it working together, once in the game, you'll be lucky to even see one another as both vanish and sometimes, only you can see your friend while your friend can't see you or the other way around, very fustrating when you want to free drive open world with friends.The good things about this game is actually not as much as you'd think. Logo's offical, the open world, huge, drivng physics, not the best. But when it comes to cup races or setting up events or local races, this seemed to work well. Cups are Singleplayer, not Multiplayer so some things within the game step on the M.O.O.R they claimed it to be. With all the problems, and the time and effort I had to put into this game made me not wanna recommend or suggest this game to anyone after my bad experiences with it.When the community offers you mods, unoffical pacthes, fixes, or cheats, you ahould clue-in & know there is a problem with this game. Also, you want to sit in you're friend car? you can do this, only if you are GREEN for UPNP and ports, if NAT is red, you simply might not be-able to play. In other words, the less security you have, the better chances you have at playing. And trust me, this was no easy task for people with tight security. lolI honestly couldn't recommend this game even in 2012 after I did actual recommend it to friends, after that, my opinion on this game had changed. I still help people to get this game working and thats the most fustrating problem about this game. Some users are lucky and get it working first try, guess what, it means you are not protected as well as you think & are open for attacks, and if you allow the ports, and the launcher still says NAT in red, this means you're networking hub / router isn't as secure or protective as you think allowing open connections once in a while. So those who are happy about it working without the hassle are actually in deep trouble if they were to surf the net. lolAnyways, Here is my results.Graphics: 6.0SouundFX: 6.0Gameplay: 6.0Multiplayer FunFactor: 5.0SIngleplayer FunFactor: 6.5 (First time I ever did this one lol)Total rating: 5.5			"

												Worth buying on sale. It's a good game to enjoy cruising around on the islands using different cars.The driving physics is not the best but still enjoyable to an extent. The game is abandoned by developers though, so servers are rather offline than online.			"

												Good game. Multiplayer works perfectly. Im glad its on sale because it is the only alternative for The Crew and it is better than The Crew on some topics. Working mirrors on interior view for instance. Also, Atari merged TDU 1 with this so you can go to Hawai in this game aswell. Of course repolished with ""new"" 2011 graphics. Sidenote: If you are willing to use motorbikes like you did on TDU 1, you have to pay extra 5 dollars to Atari via their website. You unlock motorbikes with Atari tokens in game. 80 tokens per ""premium"" DLC'ish vehicles and you can buy 400 tokens for 5dollars. I was looking for a game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 but expecting to drive fast stuff so this kinda sorta worked for me. You can move your view via mouse(You have to drag it by left click tho), some nice details like being able to open windows or convertible cars' being convertible for real (You can switch between open-air and enclosed style in action) To be honest, i bought the game to cruise with friends, if you are looking for a true racing game skip this. If you are after open world cockpit view action, thats yoru game.			"

												Well, when i bought this game i was expecting a really good racing game since the first one was amazingly enjoyable, but it turnout that it feels incomplete. There are some cars, but not that great amount that it looks like to have, the most badasses cars have to be bought through DLCs...(really disappointed). Physics are really bad, cars seem to lose control when turning, and seem to do not have any grip with the tarmac. Time attack challenges are extremely hard during the license tests (A2 A3 license made me rage quit the game). I really do not recommend this game. Waste of money, unfornatelly. Could've been great.			"

												I bought TDU 2, as i felt i needed the feeling of driving a Lamborghini (or other nice cars) in exotic locations. Then i realized they left out the Lambos from the 2nd... I played a lot the first part and of course the driving physics are nothing to write home about, but there was a certain feeling to the free roaming going 300km/h in a cabrio Lamborghini or such cars in a huge island, and simply (and very sadly) there is no other game like this, that you can buy houses and nice cars in nice locations. So i didn't hesitate much when i purchased the second for like 20 euros or so. After investing 30 hours in it i realized the developers concentrated and tryed to improve on the wrong aspects of the first game to make this sequel. Which resulted in a worse game than the first.The cop chases are downright broken. I like challenge, but the police cars coming straight at you with 200+km/h in a one direction road, and every few seconds. I think this is a major fault in this sequel. I remember the first TDU and there was nothing like this, the cop chases were fun and challanging in the same time. In a driving game this is important for me.Also collecting points for making facial surgeries? Are you kidding me? I can get past this, as you can just ignore this feature, but this kind of mentality is visible throughout the game. Even if you dont want to, the game reminds you that you should be wanting to become the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of all time. The scenarios and missions could have been made very fluid and easy to believe, but they are just dragging you out of the environment and putting you into a minigame inside of a game.Can't skip the cut scenes before the races, they are incredibly annoying after hearing them for the first few times.Some cars have their gear rations mixed up. I realized in a few cars,i think they were Lotuses, that their 3rd gear is higher than their 4th. Basically these two gear ratios are swapped.I understand they couldn't implement proper collision physics into the game with real life cars. But this is as far from test driving as possible nowadays. But at least the first TDU could somehow make me forget this. I was eager to get all the nice cars, and get some villas in nice locations. But the more i discovered and tryed out in the second part the more i got disillusioned. I just deleted it and i can not reccomend it to anyone, especially at this price. Maybe at a massive discount, but even then, you should stick with the first part in my opinion.			"

												A truly awful game. Test Drive is dead, and for good reason. There hasn't been a decent Test Drive since Test Drive 6. The car physics are not even remotely close to realistic. The voice acting and forced storyline are the worst I've ever seen, and the AI is plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It doesn't help that the level design isn't very intriguing at all either. Save yourself the money, don't even buy it on sale. And god forbid the servers are down (like when I bought it at Christmas), you can't play it at all.If I could rate this game, it'd be 2/10. I only gave it 1 extra point because the car models are nice, and that's basically the only good thing about this game.			"

												I played TDU 2 when it came out and didn't much care for it, but I just found it in the Steam winter sale for only 4.99 so I decided to give it another try... well what a waste of $5.. This game is so buggy, cheesy, and uninspired, it should have never come out. I have fond memories of TDU 1 on the Xbox 360, that game was so fun, looked great (at the time) and was overall a very good game. This game seems dead out of the gate. Graphics are very subpar, they don't even look as good as I remember TDU1 looking, driving system is OK, the ""story"" is absolutely GOD AWFUL. The ""acting"" of the in-game characters is actually worse ""acting"" than you'd see in a   p o r n o film!!! Let that sink in.. I would provide a more full review of this game but unfortunately the game glitched on me and I cannot pass one of the first objectives.. (go to the car club) it won't let me enter the mission so I just gave up.. waste of $5, don't spend any more than that. Buy TDU1 honestly.			"

												The rumors of TDU2's demise are greatly exaggerated. I played this game extensively on Xbox 360 and migrated over to PC when my old 360 called it quits. I was wary about buying TDU2 because of all the reviews stating that the servers are down, that you can't log into the game, et cetera. Those are all false. I've been playing this online with real people for several days now. The servers aren't dead and they're not ghost towns, there are many people roaming Ibiza and Hawaii and most are willing to race or exchange messages. The game does require you to create an account in order to play online, but that is easily accomplished by visiting the TDU2 website and signing up there. Installation went well, and the initial start up and every start up since has not posed any problems for me on Windows 8.1.TDU2 is an older racing game, but is still a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy collecting cars and free roaming two huge islands. I would happily pay $19.99 for this game right now on PC, and I definitely recommend it at the sale price of $4.99.			"

												Really. You should probably get TDU1 instead of this. It might be older. But it features much more cars. Bikes. And skips the extremely annoying cutscenes, and all these really bad story characters that are just badly voiced over stereotypes. ( At least for my French version, the dubs are borderline ridiculous )Even if you're only interested in cruising, this games fails to be better than TDU1, it even fails being any good at all.It managed to take the exact same recipe and they made it tedious and boring. I'm not sure how. But in TDU1, you will build a much bigger garage in a shorter time. But without it being too easy. TDU1 has a good balance.Really, the ONLY reason to buy TDU2 over downloading TDU1 ( clearly, Atari is utterly dead, don't waste your money buying it in a shop you won't help Atari getting back its feet. Also, pretty sure nobody sells TDU1 and its dlcs today )Is to drive in Ibiza. Ibiza is quite nice actually, not as big as Hawaii. But you can still ride in Hawaii in TDU2. But i would give up on Ibiza completely just to get back all of the amazing cars and bikes i had in TDU1.So the answer is no. Get TDU1 and its DLCs wherever you can.			"

												Stated off as a very fresh, open world graphical masteripiece. However due to Atari going bankcrypt in the middle of the release the game was left with NO DEVELOPER SUPPORT. The servers were dead for a long time, the main page of the game was and still is in 2016 BROKEN! Some games true fanatics managed to maintain a very stable server connection but the developer left the game.While the graphics are even today nice to look at and the enviroment is nice the game lacks in any driving challenge and can become very very BORING and REPETITIVE within 2hrs. Animation models for the characters are HORIBLE and the dialogue is terible. Some key car manufacturers are missing: Lamob, BMW, Porsche...Overall cannot recommend it to anyone. Would have been a good game if the developers havent ""died"" before the game was even released.Steam should label this game as ""abandoned project"" or ""no dev support"" in its store page. So people wont buy it by mistake. Shame though...			"

												The best open world online racing game available yet, because it is more than a racing game!Some reviews here are wrong - first of all the servers are not offline all the time, they are online all the time! The launcher may say ""Server Offline"" but that does not mean anything, start the game and you will get connected to the server, if you don't, then check your network settings! It may be the server is offline once in a while - happens to every game! And you actually can play the game in single player with an online profile!HANDLINGI play the TDU series since 2007 and in my opinion the cars in the first game had a better handling once you have unlocked ""H-Mode"" which changed the gravity and cars felt more real! Not real, but better than cars in TDU2! There is no ""H-Mode"" in TDU2 anymore, the advantage is that players don't hate each other for driving a different mode, the disadvatage is the fun! Nah, it is not THAT bad, the cars handling is somewhere between an arcade game and realistic driving.WORLDIn the first TDU game we had Hawaii/Oahu Island already, which is more or less a copy of the real Oahu Island! It is big, nice detailed, and the graphics are really not bad, it will take you a while to see everything! In TDU2 we have an updated version of the same Oahu Island map, plus Ibiza! Ibiza is even more detailed and really nice for slow exploring, while Hawaii is nicer for lot of fast racing and cruising with friends!CAREER & ONLINEThe career is implented to the online game (where you can play single player if you change your setting to not ""allow online interactions!"", start your game online and after that you can play it single player whenever you want) If the server is really not available, you still can play your online account offline! You'll have a lot to do to progress in level, win races and championship against the computer, race online against others, both has different race modes (race, time race, knockout race, offroad, street, bike)! Also you progress the game by all kind of other things, make friends, buy cars, buy houses, buy clothes, or a new hairstyle for your character, everything gets you up in level! Yes, i know.. it is a racing game and some people don't like such things in a racing game, people always find a reason to cry!- online & offline play (cruise with up to 8 player in one session)while you cruise around the island the game puts you in 'sessions' with people close to you, you can lock yourself to another player so while the game changes the session, you will stay in one session with the player you locked to!- two huge and detailed islands (Hawaii is even 4 times bigger than Ibiza)What can i say, it will take you ages until you have seen all roads, and offroads!- cars and (dlc) bikesBikes are only available as DLC, and only 3 of them, some more cars you can get as DLC too! Some cars you unlock by finding wrecks of them around the two islands! Also, the Casino is a DLC, you can win money or cars at slot machines or play Poker Texas Hold'Em with other players!- race, create races, challanges.. A lot to do! Of course it is more fun to race against other players, but be carefull, don't bet too much money! The single player races are really (too) easy, a good way to make money for cars and houses and progress in level!-make friends, invite them to you home, race them, create a club, club racing, even have your friends with you in your car as Co-driver! Or just cruise with them, or alone.. there are different type of players, you will find the hardcore driver who only cruise with class A cars and burn their tires on oahu all time, some player prefer driving a real style.. even using indicator! And of course we have the noobies who crash you as a way of saying hi - i love you too but stop scratching my damn car!- Day/Night cycle, weatherDamn, driving offroad in a thunderstorm looks really good!If you like cars, open world, online gaming, huge game worlds, and spending lot of time in a game, TDU2 is really for you! The game is not perfect, but still awesome! No real handling like other leading racing games, but more freedom than every other racing game! And no, the handling is not that bad.. i think its still better than most other racing games, as i said somewhere between arcade and real!The only game i have played more than TDU2 was the first TDU (and back a decade, operation flashpoint!)I am sure i forgot to mention something, but let me tell you if you are thinking about buying the game and having daubts, leave the daubts aside and give it a go, if you are interested in this game then it wont disapoint you!

												This game won't even start - TDU2 Launcher returns Error #03.Despite following numerous user-suggested solution on the Internet, nothing will force this piece of ♥♥♥♥ to start.Atari's website is still selling this game, despite their support and forums for this game being long dead.No articles help in making this game start.Don't waste your money - if you can, buy console version that seems to work (♥♥♥♥ you for that Atari), or look for ""genuine PC copy"" on torrents.That is exaclty the kind of publisher attitude that reinforces piracy.

												A lot of fun playing this game. A huge island to explore well 2 islands but Hawaii is the biggest one. It doesn't have that many cars compared to TDU1 but still it got a great amount of cars so I like this game. Multiplayer is a little big buggy but not so much. I recommend this game for people who like progression because this game got a long progression vise career so if you want that Pagani zonda it will take a while.			"

												Well, TDU2 had a rough start when it was first released with all the bugs. Atari are getting on top of this now. To be honest this game is good. But it had so much potential which it will never be able to achieve. When slapped on hardcore its a good fun racing game. The story and voice over are awful and I dont like how your character can only look like a metrosexual mess that just fell out of Paris Hiltons limo. The freedriving is really good and the motorbikes are great fun. All in all its a great game with some bugs. I forgive it though, afterall i have played 200 odd hours and counting.			"

												Game runs perfectly fine on Windows 10. Start it and play it. The game is the game; it's imperfect and unfinished but I love the game for what it is and the bold aspirations of what the devs wanted the game to be and I enjoyed it in 2011 on the Xbox 360 as well as today on the PC.Sadly, it looks like the servers have gone down for good, so the online functionality, arguably one of the biggest parts of this game no longer functions. I guess they finally called it quits as far as online support. Sad day.			"

												I adored the first TDU. Hooning about Hawaii.When I got TDU2, I was quite happy. That changed when I started playing. Granted, it's open world. Granted, the scenery and the vehicle renderings are good. However, I don't have a steering wheel. I play with a joypad. And it took me ages to actually set the damn thing up to work as near as possible correctly. Once I'd done that, then the game became pretty decent. I enjoy the idea of passing the tests for various vehicle classes before you can proceed with various races to ultimately win the Solar Crown. Some of the races can prove challenging, so it's not all just a hoon about.Mooching around Ibiza and the jaunt to Hawaii, gives ample opportunity to find various vehicle dealers, small side quests, outfitters, hair dressers, plastic surgeon, real estate agents, and vehicle upgrade sites, both cosmetic and mechanic. The other racers in the game, that form the people you're pitted against are generally planks. Even though it's a game, there's a real sense of ""I'm up here becuase I'm freakin fabulous, you're just a nothing"", and it all seems to be about image. Hence the reason for the outfitters, hairdressers and plastic surgeon. Which I feel is ironic for a driving game.Graphically, it's very pretty, and the rendering internally of vehicle is quite good, although I wish the dash binnacle worked properly, not just the speedo and tacho. There's a good few MODs out there, and availability to add other, non stock vehicles to your garage is quite good. There's no Lamborghinis for example in the stock game. Apart from the initial niggles, TDU2 is a decent driving game, with lots of exploration, a decent choice of motors and a good place to while away many hours.			"

												I've probably played this game more than I ever played any other. The graphics are a bit dated now and the driving is more arcade than anything meaning the cars handle and perform nothing like the real things or even similar representations in other games. The road design is often better suited to a Need for Speed franchise where wrecking is purposely added and part of the whole atmosphere of the game. Some of the stuff you do in the game, things required to advance and otherwise, seem pointless and like ""so what?"" at best. Like clothes shopping and cosmetic surgery for a couple. Who really cares about either and most of the clothes are a joke and ridiculous beyond  belief. Many of the achievements needed to advance are very tedious and often require co-operation of other players. Good luck there both in finding enough players to help you and then finding enough good sports who'll actually help you. There's a casino DLC with its own blend of poker, slots, roulette and some players seem to prefer the casino to driving. Advancing through the different level cars requires a tiered licensing before you can buy the faster cars. The story is thin- you basically work your way through a racing series called Solar Crown using various class cars from old classics to high dollar exotics to off-road. You win cash and sometimes cars from AI drivers you compete against. Warning here- this is another game where the AI cars can bump you off the road, spin you out and all that while they are about totally resistant to anything you do to them. A wreck may cost you 10 or more seconds to recover from but the AI cars hardly slow down when they wreck. There are 'missions' you do along the way to earn money and some of them are kind of dumb, too. but they pay. There is an 'assist the cops' and 'run from the cops' ability that nets you special decals and a cop car at some point. A treasure hunt is included where you find pieces of cars that once assembled become yours. These include a Cobra Daytona Coupe, Cobra SC 427, a 70 Charger, VW Beetle, an Audi, and a few others. There are a number of DLC cars and motorcycles as well. There is a paint shop of sorts but you can't do any physical customizing like tires/wheels, window tint, wings, ground effects, etc. Only paint/stickers. You can start a club and compete with other clubs and if you have enough money and reputation the club gets special cars to share with club members. But good luck there because there is no way to communicate with other club members unless you all happen to be on-line at the same time so event planning tends to fail and the clubs don't seem to last. My own few club interaction experiences were closer to demolition derbys and gang warfare than car races. There are what are called Community Racing Centers with player created challenges in the game. Both are things you are supposed to do- make challenges and compete in them. Early on in the game they were so full of cheating it was a sad joke. They're supposed to be better now and the easy cheats fixed but I can't get psyched about trying them again and not messing with them has zero effect on the game being fun.  There are the player vs player and leade board challenges, too, both at spots throughout the map and immediately initiated by a flash of headlights. Again, in the early days of the game, one of the cheats had the ability to stop the clock during a race so all the leader boards show course times of 0.00.00 going hundreds and hundreds deep. It's not just impossible to beat such times, but the boards have never been cleaned off that I know of. so nobody stands a fair chance. Players used multiple IDs, set a time and never bring that record setting player back online to accept any challenges. If that's important stuff to you, I don't know what to say. At the end of the game, it's just done in an anti-climactic sort of way. There are no more missions, no more 'new' races and there's nothing new to do. It's all ""make your own fun"" after that. There are still ways to make money- you can re-race every event you ran as often as you like. You can make money for driving semi-recklessly - right on the centerline - or some fields make money bouncing around in an off-road car. It's slow going but you can earn money to keep buying and modifying cars up to the limits of the garage spaces you have. Oh yeah, you have to buy houses with garage slots to store your cars... You get the idea.Stiill, even with not a lot left to do, it is full open world and you do have some cool cars to cruise around in which is a ball in itself and why I keep playing it again and again.  All the fun of a driving game without the pressure to do anything but drive around!			"

												Atari is gone, long live Atari! Playing this game requires registration on TDU2 site, which is supposedly dead, but still allows you to register (woohoo). Online, to my surprise, works fine - there are occasional players racing around. The game has its share of issues (you can't get achievements if you install unofficial patch, which makes performance MUCH better and adds extra cars... and other stuff) but its pretty much playable after some tweaking and setting up.Overall, its fun to race around. Graphics are primitive, music selection is limited, having an avatar in a racing game is awkward, but its still fun.If you don't own it already, I can't really recommend this game. DLCs are ridiculously expensive (they apparently still take your money for it, and no, steam $ won't do). But if you own it, hop in and lets play! :D			"

												I'd like to review this game, but unfortunately I can't. Not for lack of trying - it's broken. Atari insists on including an archaic and pointless launcher with this game, and unfortunately that launcher is broken. No matter what I try, the game itself will not launch. A great shame, because what I otherwise believe to be a reasonable game is entirely unplayable, because a crappy little piece of software Atari insists on saddling users with no longer functions. I'm using Windows 8.1 64 bit, for what it's worth.			"

												Starts out realy fun untill that fun starts to vapourize.  Seamless blending of multiplayer and single player is a bold claim made while in actual fact if the multiplayer servers are down you cannot play single player or anything.  The driving tests become impossible when you hit Hawaii mostly due to the vehicles supplied for the A class licence has the most terrible handling and will spin out of controll.  The vehicle upgrades improve performace of the said vehicle but offer not much in encouragement to upgrade.  You simply select from a list of leveled upgrades.  Often times you will find yourself googling for some answers as to how to do something as not everything is intuitive.  Driving around Ibiza or Hawaii you will often find what you think are challenges you can enter, which are infact multiplayer challenges that upon entering you soon find 0 online sessions, or ones you cannot join so in essence nobody seems to be hosting multiplayer challenges other than the instant challenges you can get from other players as you encounter them in the game.  The way to make money is to do the single player chalenges which there are plenty of but that hardly seems like a reason to have the multiplayer aspect in the first place.  And with the publisher layoffs how long with the servers be available.  Is it worth buying even if its on sale, no not realy.  Invest your money into something else.			"

												At the time I would of reccomended this game, other racing games had nothing on this game. This game was THE BEST racing game in my opinion. Then after a few years this game started becoming worse, the devs stopped updating the game servers got closed and reopened, it was all over the place. I came back to this game after a few years of not playing it, hoping that I would get the sam experience I did when I first got it. Not the case at all. Booting the game is fine, I had a few issues with my account but that's not the games fault. The gameplay wasn't like I remembered it, the game use to run smooth, it was so easy to play. Now, I get atleast 5 FPS playing it, there are fixes out there but I have no idea if they will actually work or not.I honestly miss this game. This game (IF they kept updating it and kept it alive) could of been NFS Killer, I played nothing BUT this game, I didn't even consider playing NFS while I had this game. I really hope that they fix this game now, this was the best racing game of its time.			"

												The promise of real terrain and an open map is truly amazing but this game doesn't deliver on many aspects especially on the physics side. Most elevations on the road are implemented as triangles where the car jumps and skids slightly as you are speeding and in addition to that many bugs are not being addressed. This game is dead and so is the series it seems, it's a no buy from me at this point but would still consider if they took this game to the year 2015 and fixed all the weird dialogs, stupid repeated conversations and unrealistic and cheesy characters :)			"

I had issues with my Atari account (I'm still unable to connect as the password recovery system is flawed) and the game won't start no matter what I try.

												Let me start off by first saying: yes this game definitely has its problems. It can also sometimes take quite a bit of work to get it going. I cannot guarantee that it'll be worth it for some players because everyone has their own idea of what they want from a game like this. The reason I say this is because for the main part it doesn't do a whole lot of new things especially when it comes to racing but the way it blends it all together is for sure something really nice with the social and living open world aspect to it, it can really draw you in. I often became indulged upon just roaming around the streets in my favourite car discovering new places, unlocking things & finding collectibles especially because of the encouragement you're given by the leveling system to do so. This isn't anything particularly unique now however and may wear off quick if you've already done these in similar games. Being able to buy your own house, customise and roam around in it as you please including admiring your car collection in the garage definitely added a lot to the game and makes it that little bit special even if you didn't end up spending all that much time in it.People complain about the servers but I honestly never had many issues with them (instant challenges worked fine but proper multiplayer races I never managed to get working, not sure whether it's possible or not) I struggled to get the game launched more often. Sometimes it'd decide to launch other times it didn't and I often found restarting your PC would do the trick if it refused to launch multiple times in a row. Other problems included: pink tyre marks, performance issues (which I found could be weirdly fixed by tabbing out when loading and tabbing back in again), DLC or the verification servers not working at times so literally anyone could play the DLC whether they've purchased it or not (best fault ever?) & some cars driving would be kinda glitchy. I also found the cars in some classes were a lot superior to others meaning you could either buy the best one or suffer with the rest (especially in A1) this is just my opinion however and I know many would probably disagree.If you're willing to put the effort in to make this game work and are a fan of open world racers I'd say give it a shot. I got real addicted to this game for a few weeks. (I'm using Win7, based on what I've read I think it may be harder to get it running in OS like Win10).			"

Other problems included: pink tyre marks, performance issues (which I found could be weirdly fixed by tabbing out when loading and tabbing back in again), DLC or the verification servers not working at times so literally anyone could play the DLC whether they've purchased it or not (best fault ever?) & some cars driving would be kinda glitchy. I also found the cars in some classes were a lot superior to others meaning you could either buy the best one or suffer with the rest (especially in A1) this is just my opinion however and I know many would probably disagree.If you're willing to put the effort in to make this game work and are a fan of open world racers I'd say give it a shot. I got real addicted to this game for a few weeks. (I'm using Win7, based on what I've read I think it may be harder to get it running in OS like Win10).			"

												NOT as good as the previous one. Server is not stable(maybe unavailable now), sometimes you just lose connection in a sudden. DLCs could not be purchased via steam. And the handling of the cars is quite terrible.However, the dream cars are always waiting for you.  Your CHOICE!不如前一作好玩。服务器不稳定（现在或许已经连不上了），经常突然断线。DLC不能在steam里面买。车辆的操控也挺糟糕的。然而胜在车辆众多，总有一辆是你的最爱。卖或不买，它就在这里。 "

												This game came out in 2008 and it's still fun to play. However a big MINUS is that Atari completely dropped any kind of support for it. I'm not even sure if the servers work, the site which you use to purchase coins is completely broken. The game has bugs here and there that were never fixed. The handling of cars in game is a bit unrealistic and feels like you are driving with a wooden stick. Other than that a great and fun game to play with your friends, well it used to be like that..

												So Test Drive Unlimited 2 is a game that has been out for a long time now, and I still remember the excitement when playing it for the first time; now almost 5 years after the release of the game I still find it pretty fun and exciting to play! I love the ability to just sit in a car, plug in a steering wheel and drive around Ibiza without having to race, listening to amazing and calm soundtrack, and if I want to race I just progress through the story. I have to admit the game does not have as much people playing it anymore, but the game is very old. The servers occasionally go down, but Eden Studios is doing their best to keep the servers up. I do still recommend the game, and if anyone is having a problem running the game there are go arounds on the forums, you just need to search for them.			"

												In this I both have postive and negative opinions, so read on if you wish so.This game has a place in my heart. I got it in 2011 on the PS3 and it was fantastic. The feel of picking my character, driving my car and getting miffed off when I failed the licenses. This game will take some work to finish it, but you can download a save. If you are looking for a game, to drive around, just cruise innocently, this is for you. If you are worrying about graphics, I can run it on my AMD 7850K alone, with an avg. 62/63 fps on very low and an avg. 25/26 on very high. However, since the bloody servers went down for good, the game just doens't have that same feel. It feels, dead, almost. Yes, you can cruise around, but you cannot meet anyone else and make a club, drive around with your friends, etc. The game doesn't have that same ring to it. I'm surprised the game is even still for sale, and at £14.99, I'd avoid it at that price. I got this in the sale for £3.74 I think. The game isn't even worth over £10 anymore. The developers have laid off the game entirely and abandoned it. To be honest, TDU3 would be nice seeing *wink*. The online servers aren't even up I don't think. I think the developers lost a battle in court or something, but I'm not sure.Overall thoughts:This is genuinley a fantastic game. The driving is a bit 'meh', but still driveable. The euphoria I sometimes experienced when driving on the coast in my Audi R8, was unreal. I have so much nostalgia for this. Back to my thoughts on this, TDU2 isn't worth paying £14.99 for. Get it in the sale, when it is considerably cheaper. Overall, I would recommend this game.			"

												I was 10 years old when Test Drive Unlimited 1 came out. I remember playing it, having no idea what to do. I grinded and grinded until I finally got that McLaren F1, which was sitting in the most beautiful house in the game. That was the most amazing feeling ever while playing a game, which is why I played the first TDU for about 2000 hours. When I heard TDU2 was announced, I was really happy. I pre ordered the retail version and played 2500 hours on it. I met a lot of people, I was part of a club that cruised with eachother every single week, I made friends. The Test Drive Unlimited series is a big part of my life, I loved it so much I decided to buy the Steam version as well, because I'm an achievement fapper. After I got all of those, I still play on a regular base.To me, it doesnt matter the servers are ♥♥♥♥, they still work, but every now and then they are offline. Dont let it bother you, just continue playing offline while the servers are down, they'll be up after a few days.To me, this is the perfect game, and I hope BigBen Interactive don't ♥♥♥♥ up Test Drive Unlimited 3. Please be good.			"

												I don't know what it is about this game but i've really gotten in to it, the openworld is nicely done, it's nice to drive around and see other players driving around. One of the coolest things i've done is randomly stumble across players on a roadtrip and got invited to join them which is pretty awesome, the driving isn't difficult, it isn't realistic but it isn't terrible, i'd compare it to grid and similar games. The game is deffinately worth the price, so if any friends decide to buy this game, hit me up i'd love to drive around!			"

												To start off with i coudn't play the game for the first 10 hours because ther servers crashed because of the steam sale, but, now to get to the review.Terrible for pc unless you have a controller or something of the sorts. I spent a majority of this game changing key bindings. I started off the game not knowing how to make my character walk, because supposedly PC still uses arrow keys, and then driving your car uses arrow keys. Not a big deal, changed them to WASD. But it get's worse, you can't bind keys to your mouse buttons(or buttons on side of mouse if you have them). I was planning on putting the gear changes on my 2 side buttons but was unable to. The menus are clunky and have pointless slow annimations and a terrible resolution changer. Also there's no ""fullscreen borderless"".The next few hours we're average and dull. Would not reccomend.

												-> Downloads game via Steam, still has to make a 1GB update via a launcher-> Launches game, has to create an account in order to play online, has to manually go to an external website to create one-> When trying to access the website, gets redirected at Atari.com instead-> Gives up, plays the game offline-> Starts career, voice acting and scenario sucks-> Driving mechanics are arcade-ish as ♥♥♥♥I would definitly not recommend this game, it has a lot of other small but really annoying details too. I don't really know what did I expect from Atari anyways.			"

 One heck of a game, with some flaws TDU2 is unique. It's sort of like Forza Horizon with better open-world and more realism. It's got a racing storyline, with some open-world elements to allow you to explore the beautiful islands of Hawaii (no, not Kawaii) and later on in the game (spoiler)  Ibiza . It's a console port that's mostly well done but needs some peformance tweaks.  Pros   Good graphics Very good range of cars Large and I mean  LARGE  maps x 2  Hidden easter eggs (e.g wrecked cars, collect them all and you get a car Suprisingly decent upgrade and customisation sysem  Cons  
 Securom DRM is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥ Slight framerate drops Multiplayer is down quite often Unplayable with a keyboard and mouse Physics takes gettin used to No sequel as the company has been disbanded "

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 will always be my favourite racing game; even so it got some tremendous drawbacks now.You should just buy the game on steam if:- you don't own a CD copy of it already / own one but want to get it on steam for your collection- you can live without the Multi-player (because the servers are down most of the time)- you enjoy cruising around on beautiful islands- it's on sale or cheap to get somewhere else - you love ""realistic"" physicsIn my opinion the game is still quite some fun even so it's not what it used to be anymore. But driving a bugatti with 400 km/h, hitting something and then just continue driving will always be fun.Also note that there are some issues with Windows 10. I can only play it on the lowest game setting because otherwise the game crashes every 30 minutes. (It's still enjoyable).			"

												The game seems to be hit or miss if it's working, some people seem to have no problem while a lot more people seem to be totally unable to play. all the associated websites are broken and there is no atari support, and Eden has shut down. that being said servers were running for a long while, although i have not been able to connect at all lately. The game is still great in offline mode (assuming you can get around the need to make an account or already have one). I have heard that there are unoffiicial servers but have not been able to find any information about them. So as much as I enjoy this game I would not recommend it for new players  unless the online servers come back (unlikely from the look of it) or if you just want to play the game offline. My biggest let down for playing it offline is all the cars I had purchased on my account are only accessible online.If at all possible I would love to see servers come back even if it came with a monthly maintenance cost.

												This game does not work at all for me. I've spent 2 weeks (every day) trying to get this game to work and still can't make it work.First issue I had was Atari's UPlauncher updates were conflicting with Steam and Steam would not allow the game to run without it's own updates installed but Atari kept overwriting it. Atari's solution, instead of releasing a patch, they just posted a workaround in their screwed up website which didn't help me at all, Steam also gave advice on how to fix the issue which also didn't work for me. I ended up resorting to trying a third party launcher which bypasses that b.s. and force the game to just launch, which it did but then crashes at the first windowed loading screen giving me a choice to send an error report which brings me to...Second issue. I tried fixing that windowed loading screen crash by downloading a non-steam version of the game through torrent and just using my legit key for it, tried old cracked offline version, tried old legit (non-cracked) offline version, tried up-to-date legit (non-cracked) online version, none of them could get passed the windowed loading screen. And this issue has no solution at all for it. Both Atari and Steam have not mentioned anything about this issue. I tried contacting Atari several times through their website support page but every time I clicked submit, an error page kept coming up so even their website is screwed up... so unprofessional of them to do this.My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for this game and yet it does not work at all for a lot of ppl including myself. This is by far the most broken game I have ever had to deal with so far. Wasted my money on a game that cannot be played no matter how much I try to fix their problems.Also, keep in mind that although I was able to receive my cd key fine, thousands of ppl right now can't get their key because Steam ran out of them and Atari doesn't care to make more because I think their business is shut down or something... so this game is in such rough condition that it probably should never have been developed by Atari at all and released on Steam in this condition. This game had a lot of potential and could have been so much more as most reviewers have pointed out, but Atari killed it.EDIT: Hmm... all of a sudden it works now... no conflicts with Steam and no crashes... after I had given up trying to fix it. Will completely redo this review later when I have some play time.EDIT: Ugh... it stopped working again... like... seriously?EDIT: got it working after realizing it was conflicting with an fps counter called Riva Tuner (comes with my video card drivers)... will edit this review later. But I still don't have nice things to say about the game though.			"

												When is a racing game not just a racing game? When it's Test Drive Unlimited 2. Not a sim and not an arcade racer, TDU2 falls somewhere in the middle, offering a massive open-world to explore with over 100 vehicles to do that with, from modest to exotic. For those who need to kick back, TDU2 offers many social features, and even a casino. With all of your hard-earned cash, you’ll be able to purchase new houses, vehicles, furniture, clothing and for some reason, even a haircut and plastic surgery. The game's traditional race championships and missions alone can take 60+ hours to complete, but if you're a completionist like me, don't expect to put this down until you've amassed well over 100 hours. For all it delivers, TDU2 has proven to be one of my favorite racers ever.I reviewed the game at Techgage: : http://techgage.com/article/test_drive_unlimited_2/ "

												A curiously empty experience now that the online elements are no longer supported. Lots of icons on the landscape that you will never get any value out of. You see bots around the place, probably designed to give the illusion of multiplayer activity during down times. Who knew they were racing against the machine back in the day? No way to tell.The driving is OKish. The competitions are a bit one sided, at least to begin with. Either you win easily (90% of the time) or the AI does. There are no close finishes, effectively no actual racing. If you don't make a mistake you will most likely win. AI cars are glued to the track. No barging them off to gain places.The game tries hard to be ""cool"" but it's like a fifty year old dressing like a teen and getting it all wrong.Shame.			"

												I just can'trecommend this game. I want to, on some level. but I can't.If you are like me and just would like to play offline, what you get is a driving game with very poor physics, very lite content, and a huge amount of pay walls. I really dislike seeing DLC I don't have access to. All the good cars are basically DLC.Now suppose you started playing ""offline"" and you suddenly have the urge to play ""online"". Well in this instance you have to start a new game. There is a way to use your previous save but, really, doing even that much work is just stupid. Then there is the ""characters"". Two Islands filled with the douchy-est characters I've ever seen in a game. Its just awful, even for the time it was released. Keyboard is near impossible to use, which would have been fine for a game leaning more to the ""sim"" side of things, but for an arcade racer, it seems lazy. Keyboard doesn't need to be the focus, but at least they could have thought about it.The physics themselves are okay right up to the point you lose traction. Even with a wheel, breaking loose is pretty much unrecoverable. Cars will also randomly barrel-role in a jump. That actually seems to be on purpose so you can get points. Just avoid the game. Its just not that great but also the way DLC was handled is just terrible. I'm fine with paid DLC but I prefer having a whole complete product first then adding value on top of that, instead of slicing bit off for more money.			"

(Before I start this review, I'd like to preface it by saying I STRONGLY recommend playing this game with a gamepad, and not a KBM. Otherwise, you're in for a very bad time)IntroductionTDU2 is a very unique game. It's a driving game with heavy emphasis on social elements, such as real estate, clubs, clothing, and even (wait for it) hairstyles. That being said, I wouldn't see why anyone would want to play this offline, as most of the fun is found online. It was very buggy and otherwise a forgettable game at launch, but after numerous patches, both official and unofficial, I can certainly say that this game has had most of the kinks ironed out, and it's now a playable and fun game. TDU2 features more than 80 vehicles, miles and miles of drivable area, and several game modes for you to enjoy.Content- 8/10This game features a little over 80 cars (more if you count mods, DLC, and prize cars), ranging from humble little cars like the Volkswagen Golf, to explosive hypercars such as the Bugatti Veyron. However, I will say something about the selection of cars in this game, and that is that I am very disappointed in the bias of cars. There are literally FIVE Pagani Zondas for you to choose from, 10 Ferraris, 4 Bugatti Veyrons, but not a single Honda, Mazda, or Toyota? Now that's just biased as hell. I would honestly rather be able to drive a preppy car like a Mazda RX7, Honda Civic, or Toyota Supra than I would some insane hypercar like the Ferrari 599XX, which almost guarantees that I'm going to crash it while going 250MPH, thanks to this game's ridiculous driving physics. The game does allow for you to explore more than 100 miles of in game area, spanning two islands, Hawaii and Ibiza, as well as several in game shops and points of interest. Still, I feel like the game would be a bit more enjoyable if the physics didn't make me so prone to crashing. Speaking of the physics, let's talk about them real quick.Gameplay- 6/10Initially, I found the physics to be extremely jarring. The start of the game requires you to drive Tess, the game's main antagonist, to her photoshoot in her daddy's Ferrari. Every teenage boy's wet dream, right? Well, yeah, if I could actually drive the car without smashing it into every single corner. The cars in this game are able to accelerate very quickly, but holy hell, the braking and handling is just AWFUL. It literally felt like I was playing a 2011 version of Outrun, except I was in a much faster Ferrari, and the b!tch was yelling at me to slow the F down every 5 seconds. After finally making it to the photoshoot, my ""avatar"" (who is literally the most metrosexual person I've ever seen, holy hell) descended from the vehicle, along with the damsel in distress, and were quickly escorted into the building. After that, I was given a quick walkaround of my now smashed to hell and back Ferrari, and then the screen faded into the ""cutscene"".You can get into police chases and races and all that good stuff, so I guess the actual gameplay is very redeeming.Let me give a quick piece of advice about the player models/storyline in this game: ignore it. Pretend it doesn't exist. Pretend you're playing Forza Horizon on the PC, I don't really care. Just do whatever it takes to get past this game's godawful acting.Audio - 3/10Oh my god. Ohhhhh my god. The voice acting in this game. Oh my f*ck. Eden Games would've done a better job having Microsoft Sam voice all the characters in this game, because at least that woulda been rather funny. But this? Jesus H. Christ. Why must all the characters in this game talk like *gasp* THIS? (Pretend that I'm flicking my wrist in the most gay way possible as I'm saying that). Like seriously, you think Dragon Age Inquisition catered too much to the gay crowd? Not even close, sweetheart, this game is a whole new level of metrosexual. I'm talking this game will pimpslap you if it sees you trying to play without wearing Michael Kors pants and a Gucci suit.As if the voice acting weren't bad enough, the ingame music is just plain garbage, as if the guy who was hired to pick the music had to meet some sort of racial quota, so he went on World Star Hiphop and picked out the most Liberal sounding music he could find. Other than mediocre hip hop, you can choose from dad rock, or the occasional electro/house song. And that REALLY pisses me off, because the song used in the game's trailer is one of my favorite songs of all time, Ghosts 'n' Stuff by Deadmau5. And that's literally the only song in the game that won't make your ears bleed. Disappointing, isn't it? Thankfully, you can mod in your own music with a bit of effort, but the fact that that feature was included in TDU1 but NOT in TDU2, that makes me extremely mad. Honestly, I would recommend TDU over TDU2, if it weren't for the fact that Atari killed the TDU multiplayer.Graphics - 9/10The graphics are probably the most redeeming part of the game. For a 2011 game, I have to admit that these graphics are top notch, and I'm pretty sure even FM3 or GT5 didn't look THIS good. However, you will need a very good computer to run it at max graphics, and I'd honestly recommend a 144hz monitor to go along with it, since you don't want to have all that motion blur when driving your car around Ibiza at 250 MPH. One of the super unique features of this game is that you can actually get into a car dealer and look around your car, get inside, start the engine, open the doors, and even roll down the windows. How many games allow you to roll down the windows? Almost none. The surrounding environment is very lush and vivid, certainly FAR better than the grayish brown filter that seems to be employed in almost all modern racing games. However, about the graphics, the game doesn't go into very much detail with car damage. You can scrape up your car, get it muddy, and crack a window or two, but that's about it. I understand that the licensers (i.e. Ferrari, Bugatti, Koenigsegg) don't want to see their precious 2 million dollar hypercars getting thrashed about, but it still breaks the immersion a bit. Speaking of immersiveness, you can visually upgrade your car to a certain extent by adding vinyls, paint, and rims, but that's about it. I understand that the licensers don't want their cars being adorned with pink neon and 30"" spinners, but again, it kinda breaks the immersion.Multiplayer - 9/10I gotta admit, the multiplayer is one of the coolest parts about this game. One of the best features from my favorite game, NFS Underground 2, is that you can challenge another racer at any time simply by pulling up behind them and flashing your hi beams. This is also implemented in TDU2, and you can even set your own wager, giving a new meaning to ""big dog on the block"". Other than that, you can spiff up your ""avatar"" (I really, really hate that word. Why can't we say ""player"" or ""racer""?) by buying him new hats, glasses, suits, pants, gloves, and hairstyles, to really wow your friends/opponents. You can also buy your own pad to REALLY wow them, ranging from the basic trailer park, to the all inclusive 300' yacht. All in all, I must say that the MP is really a great example of how a racing MMO is PROPERLY done, and I'd definitely recommend this game over NFS World or HEAT Online.Closing Notes & Final ScoreAll in all, TDU2 is a very unique concept for the racing genre, and defnitely a step in the right direction for MMOs as a whole. The in game music and player models are absolute @$$, but if you can look past them, then I'm certain you'll have plenty of fun with TDU2FINAL SCORE - 7/10 Great			"

												I just can'trecommend this game. I want to, on some level. but I can't.If you are like me and just would like to play offline, what you get is a driving game with very poor physics, very lite content, and a huge amount of pay walls. I really dislike seeing DLC I don't have access to. All the good cars are basically DLC.Now suppose you started playing ""offline"" and you suddenly have the urge to play ""online"". Well in this instance you have to start a new game. There is a way to use your previous save but, really, doing even that much work is just stupid. Then there is the ""characters"". Two Islands filled with the douchy-est characters I've ever seen in a game. Its just awful, even for the time it was released. Keyboard is near impossible to use, which would have been fine for a game leaning more to the ""sim"" side of things, but for an arcade racer, it seems lazy. Keyboard doesn't need to be the focus, but at least they could have thought about it.The physics themselves are okay right up to the point you lose traction. Even with a wheel, breaking loose is pretty much unrecoverable. Cars will also randomly barrel-role in a jump. That actually seems to be on purpose so you can get points. Just avoid the game. Its just not that great but also the way DLC was handled is just terrible. I'm fine with paid DLC but I prefer having a whole complete product first then adding value on top of that, instead of slicing bit off for more money.			"

												There are a few things that can describe this gameFirst of all this game is s_h_i_t Second of all , I've played this game for hours and hours , it's frustrating to be honest , frustrating and hard , but it can sometimes be good , the game has no customer support ,the server is in a really bad condition , constantly dissapearing players , chat errors , script errors , some people may not even be able to play the game because the servers can crash at any moment and you can't know when , this game maybe had the honor to be called 'good' but that was back in the Test Drive Unlimited 1 days , now it's just a pure piece of s_h_i_t and I don't recommend anyone to buy this because it's a waste of good money! If you are dumb enough and you actually did buy the game then I can only recommend you to get a controller or a wheel! Because keyboard steering is absolutely horrible !Good luck to anyone who buys this piece of s_h_i_t , after 100 and plus hours I gave an honest review of this game ! It's a 2 out of 10 !			"

												Possibly the worst game I've ever had the misfortune to own. Played the first version of this game on the Xbox 360, and really enjoyed it. So when I bought my gaming PC, I was keen to purchase TDU2. Bought the game in the Autumn 2013 sale for about £3, and wow, do I feel completely ripped off. After spending some time trying to get the game working (the servers are down apparently, and doesn't look like a temporary problem), I was hugely disappointed when it did actually manage to start. Game play (what little of it I actually managed to achieve was simply dire). Poor controls, car control is akin to driving games from the 8 bit era. Totally disgusted that I spent £3 on this. I'd have felt better if I'd have been scammed out of £100s by criminals. If like me, you find yourself tempted, hit the steam forums for the game, read the reviews, and if you still feel like buying it, well, don't say I didn't warn you!			"

												Being the 2nd of the series and hopefully not the last, this game has delivered exactly what i want from a racing game. Sure it lacks car customization but it's not that big of a deal when you're cruising with friends in such a beautiful world. Be it racing, exploring or just chilling in the casino... the fun never stops. This game never stops giving you that ""child at christmas"" feeling, reach driver level 10 and you unlock another stunning world (Hawaii), visit the real estate agent and buy yourself a new home, you can even explore lots of off-road track. The list is endless and i will leave that for you to discover.All in all i highly recommend this game, it's heartwarming to actually find a racing game as fine as this... you won't find anything better.

""SO I SEE YOU NEED A HAIRCUT.""One of the best open-world racing game? Definitely agree. How to give you image of this game? Easily - Imagine infinite highway with few cars, straight like a Route 66 and car of your dreams. Probably best description of this game. More than 100 cars to drive, from Ferrari to Mercedes and Audi. From Jaguar to Alfa and evne Lancia, Citroen and much more. And where you landing? Oh man, none other than Hawaii & Ibiza. Tropic islands full of straight, curved, clean highways and roads, off-roads, mountains, forest and many more beautiful places, & awesome views. Story is there just because somebody wants it there. It has no relevant point, I would say it is only there to make some point of making money and basically keep on living. You can style your character from eyebrows to hairstyle, and of course your clothes. Big up for me goes to the houses. There are small, medium, big. Huts, sh*tholes, mediocre flats, wooden houses or luxurious mansions and cribs. You can even own a boat where is underwater garage that let you store there those beautiful machines...I do not own Casino DLC yet, but I bought few of DLC vehicles, and it is not like you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to pay for them and they should be in the game. For me it was pleassure to have them there.The worst thing of all is, that multiplayer is dead. It's sad, but it's truth. At least we can be very HAPPY that Atari runs those servers for those few players that are in. I wonder when they turn off servers which won't be that far, and then multiplayer will be really dead. By this I want to say TD3.In fact, I love this game. I love it more than any racing game or any of NFS series. I love it more than any Dirt or CMR... Only relevant rival would be The Crew from Ubi. But we'll see.UPDATE 1: Casino DLC is good, but to be honest it is not worth 8 euros. With the current state of Multiplayer definitely not.UPDATE 2: Cloud Support - none. Atari Support tells you to play a new game, because it is not long game.UPDATE 3: Atari sold it to BigBen.Bonus Point: Atari still running the serversRating: 8.5/10 "

												Ugh, I must of have some deluded fantasies of what Test Drivde Unlimited 1 was like.This game was fun... It had most of the components that made TDU1 ok, but it just doesn't feel as sexy as TDU did. They also have less cars and more invasive DLC. That's probably the worst aspect.All that being said, I actually still enjoyed it. I didn't get far at all (which is amazing since I think I have like 40 hours) so the game is long as hell. It's also frustrating as hell (annoying collision system). Nonetheless, this gameplay is basically Test Drive Unlimited 1, it's just that they tweaked all the original rules (cops, races, stores, etc). I think the game itself is still good but all of rule tweeks were bad. I almost would just prefer they remastered the original rather than give us a sequel.			"

												First of all i want to say - this is not a racing game, its a simulator of a wonderful, luxury life on tropical islands. Really good and interesting simulator. And racing its just one of the ways(you can do missions, car delivery, casino, etc) to make for a leaving and buy that luxury giant yacht one day. Hardcore racers shouldnt buy this game and go back to gt5, NFS or whatever. But people who like beautiful cars, wonderful views and sims-mmo stuff will find it really interesting, like me.Also, its like a racing mmo. In free-ride mode and in buildings you can see everyone who is playing game atm too and you can invite them to challenge or co-op driving/events. Or gather up your friends together and make party in your home, which you can customize too.			"

												There may be a few things that you may consider ""Spoilers"" in this review.     In all honesty, this is an.. ""Decent"" game.  This coming from someone who's never played the first game, I have mixed feelings, and thoughts about the differences between the two products.  Anyway, I will give you my honest impressions on this game after having it for a year or so.  This game greets you with absolutely beautiful graphical detail, and very accurate vehicale models.  This game simulates modern, and classic vehicles in a very accurate manner, along with accurate prices too. (Most of the time.)       There are many ways to earn money in this game, some more convenient than others, some more fun than others.  One is by completing the Solar Crown Championships, which require certain vehicle types to participate in.  Now, let me say this... I DO NOT recommend attending the championships, unless you enjoy completing some of the most repetitive, monotenous acts I've ever seen.  I mean, most of them are common in a lot of racing games today, however, I just feel they are just wasted potential here.  I would have enjoyed seening the type of racing like in Midnight Club 3, which is an amazing game made by Rockstar if you didn't know.        A more convinient way of earning a bit of cash is by using F.R.I.M. F.R.I.M is a system that gives you a small amount of money for doing simple things, such as having a near miss with another driver, or constantly drifting. (It gives you $100 dollars when you start, and the money increases then.  I believe the maximum you can get in one run is $10,000.)        Another way to earn money is to race other drivers you find around the area.  The will have a random name, and flashing you headlights at them will allow you to race them instantly.  You can race the same person until you grow tired of it, so if you find that one person that has no chance of winning, you can make VERY easy money for as long as you please.     Now, for those of you who enjoy driving you valuable vehicles like a sane human being, the cockpit view is very detailed, and flows well with the overall control scheme, and graphical style.  Although, if you hate slow AI drivers, than here's something to note.  TDU2 has some of the dumbest civilian AI I've ever seen.  The are just about the slowest driver AI as well.  You just need to play the game to see.     Another note, if you want to play this game with a friend, I have some bad news.  Because of the developer studio shutting down, the multiplayer servers went with them.  It's worth searching whether a multiplayer mod will be made for this game, like the one made for Just Cause 2.  (If you have any information on that, please tell me.  I'd be willing to play online with someone.)     With all that aside, I can't help but go back to this game because of the sharp visuals, and lovely selection of vehicles to choose from.  The sounds are wonderful, the thrill of have a 1.6 million dollar car keeps you playing, exploring the island(s), and finding landmarks.    With that said, I do recommend this game, just be aware of some of the ""Moments"" that the AI has, and some of the short- comings of the physics engine.I give this game a Seven out of Ten, and I do recommend it to anyone who wants a good-looking, mixture of arcade fun, and realistic simulation.Thank you.

												Its a great game if you are into simply driving for the heck of it and exploring the open road... but if you expect this to be a bit of ""gran turismo"" mixed with debutaunte social goals [as i thought from watching the trailers] you will be sadly mistaken....the Dev team that put this together did an EXCELLENT job creating a world in which a player can explore and have fun in with a HUGE open environment; however, this environment is marred by the fact that the physics in the game are only passable if you  play perfectly.  Example being in interaction with other vehicles on the roads, hit them and you come to a dead stop... take a corner too rough and at least the game forgives a bit and will spin you as expected.   Other glaring faults I consider are that the voice acting leaves a LOT to be desired, the motivation of the characters are extremly questionable, the amount of customization is lacking in variety, & finally the ""unlocking"" scheme is laughable.VOICE ACTIINGvoice acting in just cause 2 was ten times better than this... just mentioning it.Character/Story Developmenton a chance encounter mission this lady is at the side of the road in one of the major cities, and decides to ask some yabbo in a VW scirocco to take her Pagani Zonda to the mechanic shop because she doesnt have the time to... oh and dont scratch it... Customizationto be honest i have not even bothered, primarily because the ""stickers"" are a load of... and the tech shop is really all that is needed... I have not played the game long enough to comment on the impact that owning a mc-mansion has on gameplay nor needing to buy that poolside valet bar stool thingy that apaprently i can impress other TDU2 gamers with... to me this is the equivalent of getting Recon armor in halo, or Bedazzled guns in COD franchise, or worse still a bee in a bottle from Zelda franchise.... Unlocking itemsAgain... having not played far enough to really get a sense of what is available I looked forward into FAQS and guides and saw that a player needs to to unlock the privilege to buy cars in game... nuff said... Whatever!!! in conclusion... the only selling point that this game brought to the table that i willingly thought would make it all worth it.. the open world aspect of being able to drive absolutely EVERYWHERE!! thats the only good thing about this worth mentioning...if you are looking for realism... look elsewhereif you are seeking an arcade-ish experience... look elsewhereif you want a decent story or plausible real life mimicry... look elsewhereif you are looking for an open world game that ~~promises a lot of potential~~ to drive various cars around a massive island while in the same time extremely slowly rising through the ranks of a Dubai-esque racing series with possible androids masquerading as humans... then this may be the game for you!!!

												The last time I played a Test Drive game was probably in 2000, with Test Drive 2. At the time, I gave it up for Need for Speed 3, which was significantly superior.   I chuckled to myself as I bought this game, thinking how times have changed. Now, I am officially done with Need for Speed. I have had enough of dealing with EA's barely-deliverable products. (As a fun time-waster, try emailing their tech support. It doesn't matter what question you ask because it certianly won't be the question they answer.)  But now, I'm not so sure. The lack of attention to detail, which is exactly why I decided to leave Test Drive all that time ago, is still present in this newest game. I am frustrated that a pitiful light post is able to stop a 3000+ pound car cold, and the frustration only grows when it takes the driver a significant number of seconds to get his ♥♥♥♥ back together and ease the car into reverse. I would be satisfied if the car were wrecked by the light pole, but at least continued rolling.The cars could also probably do with a new set of tires. I have occasionally slid vehicles on ice, even been stuck and had to walk home, but, before this day, I have never managed to slide a full 360 in rain.  One of the reviews already posted admitted that this was not a game for racing enthusiasts, which leaves me wondering... Who is it a game for? Is it Club Penguin, but with cars?  At first glance (which was enough to get me to buy it), the game seems solid, but it is the collection of every little thing wrong with it that makes it, in my mind, a complete waste of time, not to mention money.

												This game is really poor.The driving physics are the sort of thing you'd expect from a ps1 game. Other than looking at the speedo you can't really gauge or feel how fast you're going. You can't really drift on this game very well, which is stupid since it's something which you can use to earn money within the game. If you lose internet connection it will take you to the title screen and when you attempt to play again it will just make you watch loading screens without actually letting you play... it just takes you back to the title screen after a while because you have no connection (and carries on in a cycle). The online players as well as the pedestrian cars/bikes glitch a lot and jerk forwards like 200 yards up the road at times. I know it's not exactly a brand new game at this point, but the graphics really aren't anything worth shouting about.If you have the sort of expectations of this game that I had, i.e. something which offers a good open-world driving experience similar to that of need for speed games, but with more realistic handling, better graphics and the sort of gameplay that wouldn't get boring quickly, you'll be entirely disappointed.And also worth a mention is the pain in the ♥♥♥ installation...AFter downloading via steam it not only makes you sign up to their website to create an account for the game (hardly the end of the world, I know, but there's more to come), you have to activate the game with a serial key (something I haven't had to do with any other steam game), when you try to launch the game it will make you download another gigabyte of data (probably files which make the game as crap as it is), which WILL fail to download... at which point you should refer to this:http://support.atari.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/76/0/i-am-receiving-error-5which should fix the problem for you, but in all honesty you'd be better not buying the game and saving yourself the hassle/disappointment			"

												READ FOR A HONEST REVIEWI had this game on my Xbox for at least a year. Finally when I got older I had the right mind to build a computer. My specs are more than the requirements for the game. Gameplay wise, the game is exellent. I love the driving expierience, you can buy cars, buy houses, and the free roam is exellent. The car variety is amazing, and the level of detail, and sounds for each car, is amazing. On Xbox at least. I only was able to play for 3 hours on my computer due to how bad the game is. The textures are horrible, things dissapear, and the game freezes. After all that, I figured I would still give the game a chance due to my love for cars, and my great Xbox expierience in the past. However apon start, I was presented with a ""Corrupted Savegame"" message. Are you kidding me? In the three hours I played, I had over $300,000 and 3 cars. I cant play this game, for the $8 I spent it was not even worth it. I can't even think about playing this game anymore. When I filed a ticket on the Atari website, they responded with ""Well you played the game once, so it should be easier to replay it again"" How about you and eDen actually fix the god damn problem instead of telling me to go pound sand. Please don't waste your money on this game. There are many other great games that you can buy instead. If you do get the game to work, I envy you, because I wish I could get mine to work.			"

												I got this game massively on the cheaps in the year end sale and it was worth every penny.  I wondered how the servers would be, but they've been ""mostly fine"" but I've built up my offline profile to match my online one ""just in case"" - besides sometimes I want to be online and sometimes I don't.I got a wheel/peddles for Christmas and it has been a BLAST playing, although when I upgraded one of my cars, my wheel ""tightened up"" to the point where it nearly started smoking (even tho I've got the FF on LOW) with heavy use.  My profile where I didn't do the upgrade doesn't have the problem.  I wish I could go back to an earlier save to get rid of that upgrade!The price of DLC for this game is ridiculous - that won't be happening.  The game is nice though, I have read plenty of whining about the voice actors/animations/story line - that is part of the charm of gaming and doesn't bother me in the least.

												Great driving game.  Still has a very active online community.  The only real let down of all this is the voice acting, its terrible!  The social aspect can at times seem somewhat lacking but despite this its a nice touch.  if you get this game the casino addon is a must!  It is DLC though and can only be bought through the tdu2 offical site unfortunately.			"

												Brilliant Game, but unfortunately it's an old game and has some problems starting for a few people. It feels like EA made a sims game made around racing, I'm impressed that my steering wheel works very well with this game, and the graphics are still incredible. I recommend this to anyone who's really into a chill racing/driving experience, the game offers a great crusing experience and as a whole is a very laid back game.			"

												A continuum of a very open, unique, marvelous game Test drive unlimted. I started playing this series on the Playstation 2 and really loved how open and challeging it was. It's not like the other generic racing games where you just race a couple of times and instantly get a $1,000,000+ supercar. You have to work for hours upon hours in order to advance even a small percentage.  Even though I found it gets a bit harder in my opinion to earn money in Test drive unlimited 2 then the first one, I have found no annoying bugs, glitches or other major problems while playing it. The main things I think could be improved would be server downtime and NPC's (They act a bit awkward at times). The server downtime can get annoying on people who just started playing so that is why I recommend playing in offline mode first before you go out and ""show-off"" your cars and items. If you don't know how to start in offline mode just ask me and I'll help. Overall the game is very good, but I wish they didn't remove or change some elements that were in the original. I sort of feel for Atari though, as they are in financial trouble and really can't help with server issues, rushing development of the game, etc. The game obviously can be improved greatly but as of right now it is very good and I love it! 9.7/10 "

												There may be a few things that you may consider ""Spoilers"" in this review.     In all honesty, this is an.. ""Decent"" game.  This coming from someone who's never played the first game, I have mixed feelings, and thoughts about the differences between the two products.  Anyway, I will give you my honest impressions on this game after having it for a year or so.  This game greets you with absolutely beautiful graphical detail, and very accurate vehicale models.  This game simulates modern, and classic vehicles in a very accurate manner, along with accurate prices too. (Most of the time.)       There are many ways to earn money in this game, some more convenient than others, some more fun than others.  One is by completing the Solar Crown Championships, which require certain vehicle types to participate in.  Now, let me say this... I DO NOT recommend attending the championships, unless you enjoy completing some of the most repetitive, monotenous acts I've ever seen.  I mean, most of them are common in a lot of racing games today, however, I just feel they are just wasted potential here.  I would have enjoyed seening the type of racing like in Midnight Club 3, which is an amazing game made by Rockstar if you didn't know.        A more convinient way of earning a bit of cash is by using F.R.I.M. F.R.I.M is a system that gives you a small amount of money for doing simple things, such as having a near miss with another driver, or constantly drifting. (It gives you $100 dollars when you start, and the money increases then.  I believe the maximum you can get in one run is $10,000.)        Another way to earn money is to race other drivers you find around the area.  The will have a random name, and flashing you headlights at them will allow you to race them instantly.  You can race the same person until you grow tired of it, so if you find that one person that has no chance of winning, you can make VERY easy money for as long as you please.     Now, for those of you who enjoy driving you valuable vehicles like a sane human being, the cockpit view is very detailed, and flows well with the overall control scheme, and graphical style.  Although, if you hate slow AI drivers, than here's something to note.  TDU2 has some of the dumbest civilian AI I've ever seen.  The are just about the slowest driver AI as well.  You just need to play the game to see.     Another note, if you want to play this game with a friend, I have some bad news.  Because of the developer studio shutting down, the multiplayer servers went with them.  It's worth searching whether a multiplayer mod will be made for this game, like the one made for Just Cause 2.  (If you have any information on that, please tell me.  I'd be willing to play online with someone.)     With all that aside, I can't help but go back to this game because of the sharp visuals, and lovely selection of vehicles to choose from.  The sounds are wonderful, the thrill of have a 1.6 million dollar car keeps you playing, exploring the island(s), and finding landmarks.    With that said, I do recommend this game, just be aware of some of the ""Moments"" that the AI has, and some of the short- comings of the physics engine.I give this game a Seven out of Ten, and I do recommend it to anyone who wants a good-looking, mixture of arcade fun, and realistic simulation.Thank you.

												Not a sim. But with that out of the way, TDU 2 is an excellent, fun, expansive racing game with ""interesting"" physics that allow for a great driving experience...as long as you have a peripheral with an analog axis. Out of 10, I'd give it a solid 8.5, or 9 after drinking my coffee.			"

												READ FOR A HONEST REVIEWI had this game on my Xbox for at least a year. Finally when I got older I had the right mind to build a computer. My specs are more than the requirements for the game. Gameplay wise, the game is exellent. I love the driving expierience, you can buy cars, buy houses, and the free roam is exellent. The car variety is amazing, and the level of detail, and sounds for each car, is amazing. On Xbox at least. I only was able to play for 3 hours on my computer due to how bad the game is. The textures are horrible, things dissapear, and the game freezes. After all that, I figured I would still give the game a chance due to my love for cars, and my great Xbox expierience in the past. However apon start, I was presented with a ""Corrupted Savegame"" message. Are you kidding me? In the three hours I played, I had over $300,000 and 3 cars. I cant play this game, for the $8 I spent it was not even worth it. I can't even think about playing this game anymore. When I filed a ticket on the Atari website, they responded with ""Well you played the game once, so it should be easier to replay it again"" How about you and eDen actually fix the god damn problem instead of telling me to go pound sand. Please don't waste your money on this game. There are many other great games that you can buy instead. If you do get the game to work, I envy you, because I wish I could get mine to work.			"

												To be honest, I preferred the original Test Drive Unlimited. Using a keyboard and mouse, the early events to advance the story (time trial events mostly) felt horrendously unforgiving and everything just feels slower, heavier and less free than the original did somehow. Launching the game takes far, far too long for me, too.Maybe it just comes down to what I loved about TDU on the PS2 vs this, but I can't recommend this.			"

Edit Mar 13, 2017 - Server StatusUnkown, in all likelihood will never come online again. It's no longer recommended to buy this at full-price because you're not getting the full features. Only good for offline play. Still recommended though not highly. Estimated value for money at discounted price is only 6/10End of editEdit July 1, 2016Servers aren't always on 7 days a week without downtime or maintenance; expect downtime about once a week. On a good stretch, servers can be on for weeks without any downtime; this is way better than other MMO games where servers have regular downtime at least once a week. Downtimes can last anywhere between 1 day - 1 week so try the launcher at least once daily. Alternatively, Steam forum is also a good place to check on server status.On the plus side and this is a major plus, once you're online you can sit there for hours afk or even sleep at the wheel for days if you wish without getting kicked out by the server; no other MMO game allows this ;) In other MMOs, you'll be kicked out in about 15 mins of inactivity. TDU1 and TDU2 used to be my other homes, i was like, living in there a few years ago haha.End of editOriginal brief reviewMore than just competitive racing. Two huge open worlds where you can explore almost anywhere, even drive to the mountain peaks if you are so inclined, pun intended. Despite the bugs in the game world, it is a great place for a leisurely tour with friends, or if you prefer, drive as if your life depends on it; just don't get caught by the cops.Edit July 1, 2016 - addendumNot much to complain about this game except the traffic and keyboard control. Traffic can be a pain in the rear - erm i mean front, mostly front. They can appear and disappear at will as if  thrown in front of you for no other reason than to aggravate you but what driving or racing games has perfect traffic behaviour? Keyboard control is not smooth on asphalt for cars but for bikes it's perfect. On dirt tracks, keyboard control feels natural on almost any vehicle except for sports cars.End of edit So what's so good about this game? Well there are 2 huge open free-roam worlds, that feels alive with day and night cycles, random weather with thunderstorms, birds and airplanes flying, airplane landings but i've never seen birds land on anything. No NPC ai walking about which is a good thing since my driving is all over the place. There are NPCs in the buildings though that serve as interaction points for shops. There are different kinds of shops for customizing your avatar and vehicles such clothing shops and paint shops to name a few. Showrooms and real estate agencies are also available for you to expand your car collection and buy more properties to house all your vehicles. Having many properties means you can park at any convenient location before logging off. It doesn't matter if your garage is full. Or if you're really in a hurry, you can simply logoff from anywhere in the game world.While a lot of these customizing options and services may seem like fluff, it does add to the sense of immersion and of being in a vibrant world. What sets this game apart from all other driving games are 3 things:- You can invite friends into your house- You can drive a friend around in your car or if you prefer - a stranger.- You can drive almost anywhere where there are no visible physical barriers in place. So yeah get this game, 'coz there's nothing like it, even TDU1 falls a little short. What TDU1 does better is smoother keyboard control and the ability to set a completely private session with your friends in the game world. Everything else is better in TDU2. Last but not least, it's low in price, high in content and it can be played offline. So even if the server is down you can still have your cake (game) and eat (play) it, just not the same savegame, which is more than can be said for the likes of The Crew or Elite Dangerous.			"

												this game just doesnt work anymore. bought just a month ago played it 2 or 3 times went back to it yesterday and nothing. I have bought a $20 menu thats it. It just keeps taking you in circles waiting for it to connect to the internet server  if your luck because most of the time it wont even start the game at all. Not going to spend hours trying to get a game like this to work its a old game and support for it seems to be vanishing. This game needs to be supported or removed from steam.			"

												The server doesn't always work. When it does you usually are not playing it.The company went bust a while ago so don't expect any further support.Yes, you can still cut the internet or block it in the firewall to play in offline mode. But then you'll find out that handling isn't that good and the ride isn't enjoyable, scenery isn't bad considering the year it came out though.If you just want to cruise around and meet people online then it'd be OK... if the server works.

												I bought this game last summer saleAnd let me say this is actually the best open world ever. The game is obviously dated a tad, but the island is massive and the roads just never seem to end. Which is awesome. I reviewed this now to tell everyone this is ONE OF THE MOST WORTH IT 5 DOLLARS YOU WILL SPEND IF YOU ARE A RACING FANFor people having trouble with the DRM, just open up the ports 8889 and 3478 and you are good to go.

												From a starting point of view. Its a game following the usual plot.. newcomer wanting to make it big getting a shot at the chance. After a few hours and races I find it fun and challenging. I run it on PC using XBOX360 controler, in my humble opinion, a good setup. Different views available, various roads, beautiful scenery. Looks like I have alot to do and drive... See you out there :)			"

												It might be fun for single player, but this game is pretty much dead unless you have a dedicated friend or group of friends to play with. If you don't, keep in mind that this game is pretty much single player.The good:Cruising, open world, racing, lots of cars, lots of roads, customization of avatar and car, basic tuning of cars, houses, the old tdu 1 map, the new map, offroad vehicles, motorcycles are back, and day/night & weather cycling, random encounters with some online people will result in a nice group cruise or legit race.The bad:Mainly a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ contest between most people even in open world cruising, massive amounts of cheating, cheating, more cheats, cheaters trying to impress others by cheating, cheaters trying to annoy others by cheating, dated graphics, limited tuning options (especially gear ratios), limited suspension and grip preferences for off road vehicles, and a bunch of dlc that is not worth it.I boot this game up for a casual experience and don't plan on taking it too seriously. I still find myself having fun with it doing my own thing and meeting good people while blocking or un-linking from the dips that have issues they need to sort out on their own time. Knowing this, I can't recommend this game to anyone that wants to race online, have a fun experience with all the dynamics of this game, or play this game as it was originally intended. Also, all the leader boards are jacked up. Top scores dominated by cheaters soon after the game was released. There are plenty of other solid games out there for racing/cruising/tuning.A typical experience for many:Run into a stop sign: no problem. Run into a tiny bush with flowers on it: brick wall. Decide you want to get off the road and cruise the HUGE open terrain? Sweet. Find out how difficult it is to navigate around most terrain with all the ""obstacles"". Finally find a nice open space to floor it. See tall wheat fields and want to frolic through them;-- stopped by a tiny wooden fence hidden in the wheat. Turn around and go back into the wilderness and punch it. Yay; car stopped dead in it's tracks by a boulder hidden by a one foot tall patch of grass. Give up and go back onto the road to giv'r. Floor it. About to hit top speed; a car spawns out of nowhere 15 ft in front of you. Decide to just cruise; a random player online decides to turn on tank mod and harass you a bit or show you how fast he/she can go and get you to ride coop to be amazed. Decide to jump to a new location; can't sync with anyone. Being lonely, you decide to take a break, call your mom, call your gf, call your dad, call your brothers/sisters, smoke it up, eat, take a poo, check your phone, take a nap, take another poo, and then boot it up in hopes of it syncing with others; 3 people online and all afk. Decide to uninstall it; you re-install it.			"

												So everyone knows, sure, Test Drive Unlimited 2 was released with a slew of bugs and was considered mediocre at best. Don't be fooled by this. They have added many features to the game including challenges, cars, classes of cars and many other things. I really enjoy the fact that after you get so far in Ibiza (a decent sized island), you get to fly to Hawaii to race (not sure which island). And man, that island is larger than you think. It took me 45 minutes to an hour to drive from the airport (northwest) to the southeast coast and it was at full speed (driving an Audi TTS, averaging 140-150 mph) in real time. I love the fact that you can fully explore everything on the island. A few things this game lacks: voice acting, variety of voice acting, better multiplayer matches and/or support, Atari member support, and the issue with the fact that I completed 7 DLC missions and went in today to see I completed ZERO. Annoying to start over again. So a few issues still exist. If you can find this game on sale and you love the free roam exploring aspect, buy it!			"

This game is not played on Steam servers but Atari servers and Atari is essentially bankrupt. It's a complicated and confusing situation at present.  Atari still controls servers/MP and DLC.But for $5 (12/25/14) it's a good single player driving game. Be sure to browse the Steam forums for info.			"

												If we put aside the fact that the game *used to* be very annoying and buggy, and rarely started up, this is my honest review:TDU2 is a fun, active racing/free roam game that's great for everybody. WIth a lot of missons, many ways to earn money, and the ability to cruise in your favourite car - it sure is a game worth putting time into, and has a lot of replayability too.Personally, I love this game. I bought it for my PS3 because I heard it was buggy for the PC (at the time) - but now that it's not too buggy, and you can actually start the game up, it's a great game that I don't regret paying the full price (£14.99 currently) for... at all.Honestly, if you love your cars/autos like me, get it. You won't regret it.Overall, good job Atari! (No, you didn't read that wrong)			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 is my favourite game of all time. It differs from other racing games as its not focused on racing but more on exploration. Its kind of like Euro Truck Simulator, Most people find it boring and non-exciting but I feel that its just a game designed to make you relax and explore Oahu and Ibiza. This game has recieved some negativity due to its broken CD keys and ""constant"" server maintainance but I have never recieved any problems like this and I still find it enjoyable. Its a pity that the community has slowly faded away as its quite an old game but still a great legend.			"

												One of the best driving games you will ever play.This game is a mixed bag. As far as single player goes; it's a great driving game if you like time trials or just relaxing cross country driving. Singleplayer races aren't very difficult because the ai is pretty easy but a lot of the time trials and other solo challenges are fairly fun and some will require some practice. Singleplayer isn't too special, though. It's not bad but the game was clearly designed with multiplayer as the main focus.Because as for the multiplayer.. You're given the choice to either play online or offline when creating and in-game profile. If you choose to play online then you'll seemlessly see other players driving around the island that you can use voice or text chat with. Challenging other players is encouraged since you get rank points for doing things such as adding people to your friend list or doing challenges with others. There's also ai police that drive around which will get upset if you act malicious towards other drivers. Being too much of a bully will put you into a police chase and if any other players are nearby, they'll be given the choice of getting a police car and being sent after you. The fun of this feature is partially off-set by how most players drive Bugatti's and other supercars making them hard to catch but it's still a nice tough. You can also bet money against others in these challenges which adds a little more purpose.One of the best parts of the game that shines is the world compared to other driving/racing games. You're given two detailed recreations of both Ibiza and Oahu. In a lot of cases you can actually use a real map to help navigate both of the islands. There's all sorts of roads and highways and rural trails that you can drive on, and if you really want to you can just drive off the road completely. There's no invisible walls keeping you from driving off the road and nearly every mountain has a way to the top if your car can handle the slopes (and there are cars specifically meant for offroading.)To top of the world's detail.. You can go into various shops and buy clothes or haircuts or cosmetic surgery. You can walk into dealer ships to look at cars in detail and buy them and you can even buy houses and apartments. If you're playing online, you'll also see other players walking around in the public areas, otherwise you can invite them into your home for shenanigans. Here in 2015, it's no GTA Online but it's still wonderful if you're looking for a more relaxed environment where someone won't try to blow you up every few minutes. Also the soundtrack is pretty chill and varied.With that said, it's pretty much a recreational driving MMO with no monthly subscription and a cash shop that only consists of a few completely optional cars that only cost around a dollar each to unlock (the DLC only unlocks them; you still have to pay for them with ingame money so it still retains a degree of balance.) The only DLC that's mandatory for certain features is the Casino DLC which lets you gamble and win a Casino-exlusive car, and the motorcycle DLC. But seeing as DLC is very cheap, it's not too big of a deal.Tl;dr buy it if you wanna kill time with cars and endless roads. You get a ton of that pricetag of $20..Though, keep in mind that some people have a hard time setting up the mandatory account with Atari.Once you get past that, you're in for a good time.			"

It is broken, and since the producers went bankrupt, you cannot reach them so they can solve the problem.I am not the only one having problems with this game: http://steamcommunity.com/app/9930/discussions/0/882965239783830562/?l=germanSry. It's a german link, BUT the text is in english, so it's fine.Basically, I bought this game and after it was installed and updated, the launcher opened and when I clicked on Start, it just disappeared and never appeared again. I am not sure if there is a solution right now, even tho many people encountered this problem, but there will be hopefully one someday. Seriously. I paid 20€ for a game which doesn't even work. Please. Don't do the same mistake and just look for a different racing game :(Edit: I recommend Steam to remove this game from the shop and giving all people their money back, because this is inacceptable. It doesn't work. So basically I (and many other people) paid about 20€ for a not working game!!Please remove it!Sry.			"

												0.1/10If you have steam installed on anything other than C:\, you're going to have a bad time. Actually, you'll have a bad time anyway. This game is even more broken than GTAIV was, and for you who don't know, GTAIV was, in short, a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get working, mainly because of the Games For Windows Live ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game, however, takes the cake. I have spent HOURS pouring over this, reading almost every ♥♥♥♥ing support request and every forum post regarding how to get this broken game to work, and, in the end, the game would not launch after the ""Play"" button was pressed in the launcher. No wonder Eden is getting shut down, they can't make a game that works for ♥♥♥♥.			"

												So everyone knows, sure, Test Drive Unlimited 2 was released with a slew of bugs and was considered mediocre at best. Don't be fooled by this. They have added many features to the game including challenges, cars, classes of cars and many other things. I really enjoy the fact that after you get so far in Ibiza (a decent sized island), you get to fly to Hawaii to race (not sure which island). And man, that island is larger than you think. It took me 45 minutes to an hour to drive from the airport (northwest) to the southeast coast and it was at full speed (driving an Audi TTS, averaging 140-150 mph) in real time. I love the fact that you can fully explore everything on the island. A few things this game lacks: voice acting, variety of voice acting, better multiplayer matches and/or support, Atari member support, and the issue with the fact that I completed 7 DLC missions and went in today to see I completed ZERO. Annoying to start over again. So a few issues still exist. If you can find this game on sale and you love the free roam exploring aspect, buy it!			"

												This is a decent single player game but be sure to check the Steam forums about servers (or lack thereof) if you're interested in MP.  This game is not played on Steam servers but Atari servers and Atari is essentially bankrupt. It's a complicated and confusing situation at present.  Atari still controls servers/MP and DLC.But for $5 (12/25/14) it's a good single player driving game. Be sure to browse the Steam forums for info.			"

												I generally do not write reviews and when I do I like to take the time to write a good one. That being said This review is not the case, I can only write my inital impression. Why? Because that is as far as I got. Upon installation I had to create an account on a website that had a security warning, I decided I trusted Atari enough to proceed, but then the half broken website that displayed was anything but secure looking. After registering an account with them, which I shouldn't of had to do because I do have an STO account, the email token I was suppose to be sent never showed. (Yes I did check my spam, and tried to get the varification sent again 3 times.) Once in the game, the controls were set to mapped to UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT...Instead of W,A,S,D....Fine I'll just change them....but only some would change. The game would not accept any key for remapping the brake...All this being said, it is likly this just my experience...still no game should be this broken on steam and my only comfort is that I got this game on sale, but I will be writing steam for a refund.

												Let me start by saying i put over 500 hours into this game from the xbox 360 and loved it to death. I missed it so much and maxed everything out so i said hell yeah i will do it on pc too. Well the game plays really great and the driving is not perfect but each car feels different and driving around with friends is so much fun. I even made friends day one playing this the last few nights. This is an amazing cruise around and enjoy hanging out with new and old friends. There is so much to do in this game to keep you coming back. The online rarely max's out but there is always people in my game. The only huge downer for this game is the dlc which you need to buy atari tokens to buy the casino dlc and cars. I read from some they never get the tokens they paid for and the support is worthless if not dead. It seems like a huge gamble and sad they did not care to fix this stuff to work ok to buy stuff. I still think this is a must own cruise around and do random stuff. It  holds up pretty well for a old game and still is one of my favorite free roam cruise around car game. If you are super picky avoid this if you are looking for fun with others and fun stuff to find and unlock you will like it.			"

												This is a good game... plagued with gamebreaking bugs, ♥♥♥♥ customer service and a pretty much dead developer.  Also the game might not even make it past the ""Press Start"" screen which is poor.  If you ALT tab the mouse & keyboard/controller might become unresponsive.  Lets be a bit more specific here. To get the game to start properly (get past the launcher, which is cancerous) I had to download this[i-knyazev.ru] program.  Thumbs down for that.A lot of good cars require microtransactions to unlock.  You need ""Atari Coins"" or some ♥♥♥♥ like that but wait...  they are broken too!  You need to buy them on the website, but navigating the tdu2.com (which now redirects to atari.com) was tumour inducing.  Sometimes the pages CSS/JavaScript would just fail completely (without a fix, leaving the barebones HTML) meaning you would have to sort through it all to find the log-in prompt.  Thumbs down for that.With all that aside, you have a pretty good game.  There is a broad selection of cars to chose from.  There are 3 types of cars Type A (sports, super and hyper cars), Type B (SUVS, trucks) and Type C (classic/old cars) with their own unique races.  Each of them have different stages.  Type A has 7 stages of cars (stage 1 would be a Koenigsegg or a Buggati, stage 7 would be a lower end Alfa Romeo.)  That might seem quite confusing but it is a thumbs up for that.The maps are pretty damn big.  Yes maps.  There is not one but two maps included:  Ibiza and Hawaii.  They are pretty much complete re-models of the real islands.  (scaled down a bit).  Most of the towns you see in the game are real towns.  The map is not as incredible as ARMAs but it is still pretty good.  Thumbs up on that.There is not much else to say.  The review started to get a bit... shoddy near the end here but it is the best I can do.  I am going to give this a thumbs down, mostly because you might have to download 3rd party software to get the game to work properly which is quite poor on Ataris part.			"

												I remember seeing ads for Test Drive Unlimited 2 back before it was released and being absolutely floored with the freedom and graphical fidelity promised. Several years later I had all but forgotten it’s existence when suddenly it popped up in the steam winter sale. What perfect timing! I was itching for a good open world driving game and along comes one that I had wanted so badly on sale for just a few bucks.Well 10 hours later my itch is gone, but TDU2 makes a terrible scratcher. I’m not sure if I would have been as disappointed had I picked up the game in its prime, but with the multiplayer non-existent and the game itself being an absolute nightmare to install and get running due to the servers being neglected for the past 3 or 4 years, there is little left to be loved about this game. It’s really cool to see all the car brands licensed and buying houses to decorate definitely appeals to the Sims lover in me, but finding the dealers is a pain and the game world is unfathomably massive. It’s fun to drive and the cars handle well, but the amount of mundane driving about you end up doing causes your eyes to glaze over. By the 8th or 9th hour of play I found myself watching Netflix while I systematically scour a city for a particular dealer or make my way across the world to a different race. At that point I realized it just wasn't that fun and I uninstalled it.			"

												I pre-ordered this game when it first came out on Xbox 360 and bought all of the dlc. Owned all the cars and houses, explored both of the maps and even reached roughly max level. I've probably spent a few 1000 hours on this game. This game was truly one of the best racers out there, (even if the cars did handle like they were snowballing down a mountain sometimes) however I wouldn't recommend buying this on steam. The launcher is buggy, the servers are almost always down and the game's pretty much been abandoned. HOWEVER, I've heard that the rights to Test Drive Unlimited have been bought by another company, so here's hoping that they make a TDU3 as I can easily say that it's one of my top ten game series.P.S. If you still wanna experience TDU2, you can play in offline mode by disconnecting your internet. Not as fun I know but still a viable option.			"

												the game is no longer supported by Atari and therefore the DLC content is no longer up for grabs. It also means that bugfixing, which unfortunately is required, will not take place. the driving itself is well worked out but relies on playing with a controller.			"

												I pre-ordered this game when it first came out on Xbox 360 and bought all of the dlc. Owned all the cars and houses, explored both of the maps and even reached roughly max level. I've probably spent a few 1000 hours on this game. This game was truly one of the best racers out there, (even if the cars did handle like they were snowballing down a mountain sometimes) however I wouldn't recommend buying this on steam. The launcher is buggy, the servers are almost always down and the game's pretty much been abandoned. HOWEVER, I've heard that the rights to Test Drive Unlimited have been bought by another company, so here's hoping that they make a TDU3 as I can easily say that it's one of my top ten game series.P.S. If you still wanna experience TDU2, you can play in offline mode by disconnecting your internet. Not as fun I know but still a viable option.			"

												While I adore the concept, and it's done so close to extremely well, the handling of the cars is so horrid if you play on anything other than the easiest difficulty that it just ruins it. 30 MPH, tap a directional key, and WHOOPS, I'M SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.

												When you purchase this product dont expect much from the publisher, their site doenst work, you have to manualy activate the game trough your program files. The game launches in windowed mode on windows 7 x64, and the only way to fix this is to alt enter because there are no options trough the game menu or the setup document. When you finnaly have to game running you can also expect to wait 1-3 minutes everytime because the game has to check installation files and network everytime you are forced to use their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher.The games looks alright by '11 standards but nothing fancy. Than there is AI which is not programmed to give way when they have to and will randomly bumb into you. Than the police mechanic is realy bad, they apear out of nowhere and will ram straight into you. When they stopped you, you have 5 seconds to get 2-3 meters away or you ill be put into custody, it doesnt matter if you are stilling rolling away.11/10 Wont buy again			"

												This game would have been fun, but the story (Or lack thereof), the tedious and repetitive races with the same, identical intro/outtro sequences, and the horrid liscense schools that can't even be done late-game with a M/K setup, make this a game I really do not want to recommend.Is it fun? Ehh, yeah. For a time. But the studio who made the game is closed down, all the best additions are DLC, and the game itself is rather Lackluster. I would recommend any Need For Speed, Burnout, Flatout, Spintires, NCG, Asetto Corsa, Forza, Grand Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Flight Simulator, Tank Simulator, Person Simulator, Goat Simulator, Dungeon Crawler, MMO, RPG, JRPG, ARPG, Rubix Cube, Simon Says, or board game over this game.

Short version: If you want single player offline cruising, get TDU2. (for $5 when it's on sale)If you want anything else (responsive controls, racing, challenges, story mode, good overall sound track, etc) do NOT get TDU2.Long version:PROS:  two huge islands to drive around on for the sake of casual cruising.  That's it. This is the sole only reason worth playing this. If you want this and this alone in offline mode, go for it.CONS:..........  I'll just write a whole book here......""Do I want quality or quantity?""Well, this game offers a high quantity of low quality content.It has been a disaster since day 1. It was never finished (this is confirmed), what you will play is a beta profuct.- Basically no moderation. It's a cheater paradise. The few who get banned return instantly to ruin other people's games. CRC mode (challenges made by players for players) was made extinct because of this. There goes 33% replayability content of what this game was supposed to offer.- The game is on life support and held together by dry tape. A mere skeleton crew is running the servers which goes down a lot, A LOT, without any warning; you never get noticed in advance or told when it will be back up like any other well-kept game does. This was common since the beginning when they dared charge $50 for this mess. I expect Atari to pull the plug on the server unannounced very soon and you end up with an unplayable game. Some say to play it in offline mode, but what is the point of promoting an MMO (or M.O.O.R. as Atari wanted to hype it) if it is so extremely unreliable and offline a lot?  Its online feature is supposed to be a big selling point, yet it fails; oh how it fails at this. The online feature of this game is very uncertain.- Atari has behaved very unprofessional towards its customers this entire time, we get no proper feedback, no messages when the servers go down, the official forums have died a long time ago, support tickets go unanswered etc.- Your save game file is stored LOCALLY on your PC, not online. It can go corrupt at any random moment due to faulty programming, so you are expected to make a manual backup everytime you play. Doesn't happen to everybody but it happens often enough to many people in general that this is a huge game-breaking bug that was never fixed.- Difficult to play with friends due to the random 8-player session system. I had a 25% success rate to join my friends at all. Eventually they all left, I don't blame them.- After you finish the game (I did this within 1 month after release) earning money is no longer fun. It's a tedious repetitive boring grind-fest. What were they thinking removing bomb mission after you do them? They gave the game diversity at least. (they weren't thinking really, I can't list all the many bad game design decisions but they are MANY!)- No big secret here, the physics are awful awful awful. Some cars behaviour is just unexplainable. Collision reaction is just as buggy. This is an arcade car game, well it sure doesn't control as such. It feels like the air was let out of the tires. The Burnout series, the Midnight Club series, the older Need for Speed series, these are all CORRECT arcade physics games. Heh, even TDU1 has better physics. What the hell happened here in this sequel?- The AI in single player races is a joke. Your rival AI opponent rubberbands around you no matter how good or bad you drive, the rest always stay far behind. This is a big contrast to the extremely hard (& pointless) driving school sessions which may block you early at the start of the game for the average gamer. Don't be fooled what others say, you will not become a better driver by finishing them, just relived that you passed those frustration-fests.- The Sims elements is not a good meaningful addition. You will giggle about it at first, but soon it loses its luster and meaning. This is a car game, you won't be seeing your character or your houses indoors for most of the time. It was a waste of time and resources developing this Sims stuff. The time would have been better spent finalizing other more useful game features (which are broken or simply not there).- What made TDU1 good has been removed from TDU2. (too many to list here). Many steps backwards were taken.- Don't let the biased Metacritic score fool you.  That score is based on the launch condition the game was in (wasn't good back then either) and the positive thinking expectations of what it would become. Well, as time passed, the game got worse and worse. More errors/bugs were introduced instead of fixed. Force feedback got broken, innocent people getting marked as cheaters (their cars turn into Pink Mustangs), casino DLC getting more buggier, etc etc.GOOD games promise XYZ, and deliver XYZ.TDU2 promised XYZ, it delivered only X. (the goal-less cruising). The people who like X are the only ones who like this game and treat it like it's the best thing ever. That's a terrible way to review/recommend a product to others. You review THE WHOLE package, not just the part you like. Not everybody plays an openworld game for the same reasons, since you know, openworld games offer a lot of varied gameplay. But like I said, this openworld only offers X, nothing more. That makes it a very limited openworld game. TDU1 did deliver all its promised XYZ.  So if you want to cruise offline, go play that instead. It has better working finished content. Atari, or what is left of it, doesn't deserve any money from TDU2.I can only guess how many unfortunate people followed such biased misinformation and bought this thing only to rage-quit soon afterwards, having wasted their time and money. For every 1 satisfied player in this game, you will find 9 others who hate it. Just check twitter, facebook, etc etc (even these are practically dead). You will see a lot of hate, very little praise.			"

You sit there watching the camera move around showing you scenery in a ENDLESS LOOP... I bought this game and it is completely unplayable. Then finding out that when you watch the scenery for a good 3-4 minutes it says the servers are unavaliable... It will NOT let you play right out of the box.

												I have played hundreds of hours (I bought Steam version during winter sale in 2013) and I wish I could play more but the servers are pretty much dead. This game was made to play with the others and is still enjoyable in offline mode but it is not the same. I would recommended this game if servers would be still available.Guys that left from Eden Studios have joined to Ivory Tower which made The Crew game. It is not as good as TDU2 but I enjoy this game as TDU. The Crew's price is not so good and Ubisoft is publisher but in my opinion The Crew is better option now.EDITThe Crew is getting worse becouse od Ubisoft. Don't buy. Playing TDU2 offline is better idea.			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 is what you would call a blatant console port, in other words a total insult to pc gamers. The kb+mouse combo just feels awkward while playing TDU2. The game also runs like ♥♥♥♥ even on high end machines; I have a 6 core AMD clocked to 3.4 GHz combined with an ATI 5850 OC edition yet I still have visible graphical lag in this game. Furthermore this is not a racing game, yes you can drive cars around, but the racing aspect in this game is just half baked. TDU2 is Eden Games attempt at emulating face-book in a pseudo-racing genre. The sad part is that your avatar/house is more customizable than your car. This games physics engine also appears to be absent. You can ram in to trucks all day, the only visible damage you will have on your car is dirt and a couple scratches. There are many more problems but I am on a 180 char limit. Just know that if you buy this game, expect to be blown away by mediocrity.			"

												We still play this often.  We have formed a 2nd club to accommodate everyone that has recently joined us in the game.  this will allow club vs. club matches which ALL need for rank/progression and every club needs to advance to the next level club.  Come join us in there!!!  Always remember to keep a backup of your ""savegame"" file that is automatically saved in mydocuments/edengames/testdriveunlimited2.  this is VERY critical as several friends/members have suffered having to start over due to the game somehow corrupting their profile, and/or the bogus ""DLC vehicle hack detected"" error which changes all the DLC vehicles you have (AND PAID Atari MONEY FOR!!!) to the pink Miami Harris mustangs..... yeah, that's NOT fun to go thru.

												As a fan of Test Drive Unlimited 1 on XBOX 360 I was put off with all the reviews I have read when it came out so much in fact I forgot about the game until a friend of mine mentioned it during the Winter Sale 2014, He paid for himself and me a copy about £3.49 I think it was and oh boy how Atari just rushed this out and tried to get as much coin in before they went bust or to whatever state there in now. The game is terrible from the very first game car handling is out the window and is just stiff and arcady, vehicle sounds are awful mostly to me seem re used for every car but higher pitched for high end cars, the island looks ok not upgraded in visuals over TD1 as I would of thought.The story is awful your car parker guy who starts off dreaming he's been giving a Ferrari which turns out the woman who gives you it it nothing but the real owner of the car???, who then thinks she is punishing you by driving her to her destination because she's going to be late okkkkkkkkkkkk. The voice acting is terrible really poor like they just used the own devs creating the game to give the samples to save money, your player while driving the car is as stiff as a bloke getting a rectal exam it's beyond a joke.But it's the installation of the game thats a right royal pain in the backside for anyone installing it now it still has secuROM whch to me is pointless considering Atari really ain't around anymore and sometimes the online are up or down. With this game registering through STEAM why bother with SecuROM what's the point really I will be always baffled as to why games carry such things when you need to be signed into STEAM for most games they could of just gave it an always online system. In todays games we mostly are always online for multiplayer but I don't think a game like this really needs SecuROM, it took me about 30 mins to understand what to do to activate the dam game basically you copy and paste the CD KEY into the box provided to activate it and your LIMITED to 4 yes 4 ACTIVATIONS which you can earn back when you remove it but again this system is just pointless.

												The concepts and content of the game have the potential to make a fun and challenging racing game. But they don't. The exectution of this game is terrible, the controls are bizarre, the multiplayer (for me) was barely functional and only worked once in a blue moon. And worst of all, it runs absolutely awfully on my PC (which is capable of running Far Cry 3 on ultra), it's choppy and slow, and doesn't even look that nice to make up for it. I played it for about an hour, then deleted it and never played it again.			"

But when the online aspect of the game is poor, it makes it feel like you're playing a broken game.I did have some decent hours and fun online, racing/cruising around with other players.

												This is one of my favorite driving simulator games. The driving is realistic, there are lots of cars and the game is relatively bug-free, at least in my opinion. It does get a little boring though if you only do the main missions and forsaken the side-ones. A real downside is now that Atari does not exist any more there is no way of unlocking any more of the paid cars. Anyways, its a fun game and if you don't mind not being able to buy some of the cars, this game is a joy.			"

												I probably would have enjoyed playing this game if it actually worked properly. Don't buy this game, it's a disgusting excuse for a pc-port. I've spent hours trying to get the game to work properly but it just can't. There are so many things wrong with this game. People even had cases where having a camera attatched to their pc was the cause of the game screwing up. Although that's an easy thing to fix by disabling your camera for most of us who can't get this game to work, the fix isn't so simple and there might not even be one. This game has been out on steam for nearly 3 years and it's still horrid. If this game is really something that interests you wait for it to go on sale. I bought the game for about $6 on sale but don't even pay that, wait for it to go to like $3 and try your luck with it but if it doesn't work, don't expect a patch to fix it because if the game has been out for this long and it still has such big problems then the developers obviously don't give a s***. TLDR: Don't buy this game. Sure, Eden Studios released a game called Test Drive Unlimited 2 on PC but it's an insult to all PC gamers to call this a PC-Port.			"

												The driving part isn't bad, but the way they implemented the open-world aspect kills it for me.

												02/01/2014If you look at the steam store today, you will notice that ths game has sold out!That should be enough to make you get it!The game is everything a Social Racing Gamer could ask for.The game is very challenging as it calls for you to have an almost perfect race in most cases and obtaining the in game licenses can take some time to get a hang of due to no assist on steering when you drive any cars in the driving schools. Dont let it frustrate you though, take a break, come back later and do it.Once you have the licenses sorted the game comes with endless hours of fun and social gameplay.The ultimate game for cruising with friends as there is a collision enabled free roam as well as indicators for all cars! Combined with the cockpit view, you get an incredible feeling, atleast i do.It is a lifestyle game, from expensive clothes, to houses, to beautiful car showrooms and garages to the 100 cars in game its everything I could ask for!With regards to the DLC, I would recommend not buying any as there are issues with atari tokens and there is no support as the studio has been shut down. The game is still fun without the DLC as normally they are just special versions of already in game cars with a few exceptions.The handling is somewhere in between arcade and sim, but i found the hardcore mode very interesting, but make sure for the harder steering modes you have a force feedback available controller (Almost impossible to win races, etc if you dont).The graphics in the game are bearable, but a little distance away from the new games released. But for a game that has scaled down maps of Ibiza and an island in Hawaii (Oahu), i guess they had to cut down some graphics somewhere. The graphics in the houses, garages and showrooms are beautiful though and you can open doors of cars, start engines and invite other friends over and much more.Pros:Beautiful carsUnlimited vinyl customisationSocial aspectsOver 4 hours to drive around the islandsCons:Not user friendly at first - Once you understand the way it works your fineDriving is challengingServer problems - you need to sort out ports for connection (long process)DLC - risky to purchase coz of bugsOverall its an excellent nostalgic game altho it does have a few bugs... all in all if you can work around the bugs its amazing! good to play with a bunch of friends..

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!Seriously, this game is so buggy its not even funny.  It looks like it has pretty good game play, but I seriously can't play it.  (Just for reference, my rig plays DiRT 3 on the highest settings, 1080p no problem ~30-60FPS).  The problem this game has is that it doesn't want to load sections fast enough, leaving you waiting up to 5 seconds on a FROZEN screen... NOT ACCEPTABLEThe game play actually looked fun.  It had some real RP, kind of like Need for Speed: Undercover, but you actually got to move around.  This game is inbetween Undercover and free world games like GTA.GET A BETTER GAME If you like the trailer or screenshots, I would suggest you get Need for Speed: Undercover for an fun EXTREMELY fun alternative, or DiRT (1, 2, or 3) for the best racing experience on the PC.  If you have those games, its still BETTER TO LEAVE THIS GAME ALONE, COLD, IN THE DARK!Seriously, I'm completely ticked at Atari...			"

												Dont be fooled about how many hours i have on here, im max rank on 360 and what i can say is tdu2 and tdu are the best racing games ever made when they where in there prime. Sadly i can really play on pc because my laptop is to bad but if you want multiplayer for this game youll have to play on consol but this game works fine for singal player so if your looking  one of the top racing games in the world just remember that this game is not supported anymore so any truble you may have with it, please dont let it make this game look worse then what it was.

												As a fan of Test Drive Unlimited 1 on XBOX 360 I was put off with all the reviews I have read when it came out so much in fact I forgot about the game until a friend of mine mentioned it during the Winter Sale 2014, He paid for himself and me a copy about £3.49 I think it was and oh boy how Atari just rushed this out and tried to get as much coin in before they went bust or to whatever state there in now. The game is terrible from the very first game car handling is out the window and is just stiff and arcady, vehicle sounds are awful mostly to me seem re used for every car but higher pitched for high end cars, the island looks ok not upgraded in visuals over TD1 as I would of thought.The story is awful your car parker guy who starts off dreaming he's been giving a Ferrari which turns out the woman who gives you it it nothing but the real owner of the car???, who then thinks she is punishing you by driving her to her destination because she's going to be late okkkkkkkkkkkk. The voice acting is terrible really poor like they just used the own devs creating the game to give the samples to save money, your player while driving the car is as stiff as a bloke getting a rectal exam it's beyond a joke.But it's the installation of the game thats a right royal pain in the backside for anyone installing it now it still has secuROM whch to me is pointless considering Atari really ain't around anymore and sometimes the online are up or down. With this game registering through STEAM why bother with SecuROM what's the point really I will be always baffled as to why games carry such things when you need to be signed into STEAM for most games they could of just gave it an always online system. In todays games we mostly are always online for multiplayer but I don't think a game like this really needs SecuROM, it took me about 30 mins to understand what to do to activate the dam game basically you copy and paste the CD KEY into the box provided to activate it and your LIMITED to 4 yes 4 ACTIVATIONS which you can earn back when you remove it but again this system is just pointless.

												Still an okay single player game if you like driving around but the biggest selling point was the interaction with other drivers/players. Since the closing of the servers that's no longer an option.Oh, and if you have Windows 10, don't even bother. Securom killed this game. Ironic that the DRM meant to protect it was the cause of it's failure a couple of years later.In short. Avoid. Spend your money elsewhere. Unless of course Atari update and patch... lol j/k... we know that won't happen.			"

												Horrible ♥♥♥♥ing game. There's a reason why a game that's less than a year old is 10 bucks. The developers never finished the game, and instead of addressing the issues that were there, they instead added ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC, ie Bikes, which are useless as ♥♥♥♥. Don't buy this. I wish I hadn't pre-purchased it. Only reason I did was TDU1 was so damned good. This game is NOT TDU1. It's horrible.UPDATE:DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! They dropped support for this ♥♥♥♥♥torm of failure a year ago. Enjoy a game that's being run by.. no one? That's right, the studio is dead. Atari has dropped this like it has plague.			"

												This is a very good game and it is a lot of fun. However, if you are someone like me who judges a game on how the cars handle, how you can upgrade them and what level of assists there are that you can turn off, this is not the game for you. The cars dont handle well really, kind of arcadey whereas it really should be more simulation based. Also, you cant upgrade the cars properly, it is more of a level system and finally there arent proper assists like tc, abs or whatever, it is a 3 level system of max, medium and low assists that arent very good as you cant properly turn of tc and drive an ariel atom sideways down a motorway like i wanted to do, however you cant. It can be fun for a bit, but i wouldnt suggest getting it.			"

(Just for reference, my rig plays DiRT 3 on the highest settings, 1080p no problem ~30-60FPS).  The problem this game has is that it doesn't want to load sections fast enough, leaving you waiting up to 5 seconds on a FROZEN screen... NOT ACCEPTABLEThe game play actually looked fun.  It had some real RP, kind of like Need for Speed: Undercover, but you actually got to move around.  This game is inbetween Undercover and free world games like GTA.GET A BETTER GAME If you like the trailer or screenshots, I would suggest you get Need for Speed: Undercover for an fun EXTREMELY fun alternative, or DiRT (1, 2, or 3) for the best racing experience on the PC.  If you have those games, its still BETTER TO LEAVE THIS GAME ALONE, COLD, IN THE DARK!Seriously, I'm completely ticked at Atari...			"

I am Asian so I like Asian cars .Plot makes no sense and voice acting makes you can't take the game seriously.If you just wanna drive like me and you don't care for the stupid plot ,just download someone's savefile with all the cars unlocked and have a good time cruising.

												I love it, buy this game if you like to drive around in cool cars. Here are some cons in my opinion: very few Asian manufacturer cars , no Toyota or Mitsubishi, only Subaru and Nissan which has the least customization. I am Asian so I like Asian cars .Plot makes no sense and voice acting makes you can't take the game seriously.If you just wanna drive like me and you don't care for the stupid plot ,just download someone's savefile with all the cars unlocked and have a good time cruising. P.s. there is an active nodding community of you want cars like lambos and others, but I haven't tried those yet , try googling ""tdu unofficial patch :)""			"

												I've modded games before, I've manually changed config files and created batch files for games, I've set up port forwarding for games, but this game is still a PITA to get running.  Supposedly the unofficial patch and launcher fixes this, but at this time I simply can't be bothered - should NOT have bought this, Steam should NOT be selling it, at least not without a warning or their own documented solution to make sure it works.Oh, and that 1.3 hours it shows - that was all non-game time since it never actually got past their connection/server check...

												A good racing game. Driving isn't great, FFB is pretty bad, but the concept of free-roaming in an open world (O'ahu in Hawaii and Ibiza) is great.

Not meant to make the game more enjoyable, just to squeeze more money out of the players.5. Unreliable servers. you could be Co-driving with someone and suddenly get teleported to a different server.6. A few hours into the game and you'd be asking if the handling could get any worse and the physics engine would completely screw up. HOW IS A KERB ABLE TO BRING YOU TO A COMPLETE STOP!?7. Soundtrack is crap.Racing purists, be warned. This is a game made by people who do not know how cars work. Heck, they still think gravity is magic.

												You know what? Even tho this game seems to be dead, even tho people rant about bugs, even tho I didn't play for long, since I read about NAT problems... This game has this... something. It isn't bad game. It is very well made game. Unfortunalety it get cross under it's head, but imo, it should still work. Like Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare servers. And MW2. This game is about cars. About driving them. About feeling the wind in hair, exceeding the speed limit, pressing pedal to the metal. Racing with guys, friends, people you see first time. Do you dream about driving Bugatti Veyron? Test drive. Or maybe about Caterham R500? Test drive! Or maybe about Ford Mustang GT? Test drive! :3 ♥♥♥♥ it! Check it by yourself. There's always this refund ability on Steam.If ever this game ""return"" to life and servers are going to be more stable, I'll back. I'll sell 2k hrs of my life to reaching possible level, to reach my happines, to get every possible unique and hidden car, to get what I dreamed in this game, Caterham R500.I recommend this game. I really do. No matter what is actually happening. I don't care. I love this game. It's a great game.			"

But I mean, it's a racing game but the way they execute the whole ""Be the best race driver evaar!!!"" is pathetic. DLC have the only good cars and even then, those cars have pathetic controls.

												A very flawed game, the UI is terrible, changing button layout is such a hassle, no ""link"" on the login page to click on, you can't set an online profile up, the game has strict NAT so you have to tinker with your firewall to get around it but how many people do that? So online is dead, it's quite dull as well compared to the first game. The pros? Well hardcore mode is more sim than the last game and now you can do you're own stickers(paint jobs) and create what ever you can imagen which I believe all racing games should have. I give this game 3 out of 10, avoid, it's currently false advertising as nothing works.			"

												I didn't have really high expectations for this one, since I never really got into the first TDU. Not sure why, the world felt empty, there were no pedestrians, and if you passed the finish line/checkpoint (read; but didn't stop) you had to restart all over. I mean... if I PASSED the finish line or checkpoint, didn't I finish it ? Even if I drove over ? But that was TDU1. Does TDU2 do things differently ? I can't tell. I've played for 30+ hours now and I haven't bothered to check. What does that say ? That it's a fun, addicting game. It's no sim by any means, but you get to drive around wherever you want, collecting cars and parts, taking pictures, buying garages, things like that. And you can take your time to do these things. It's quite relaxing. And if you want to start a race with the computer or anyone else, you can do that too. Only thing I hate so far is the social stuff they put in it. You just can't ignore the The Sims influences. Pity. But... still recommended ![Rating: 85/100]			"

												The screenshots don't do this game much justice - it's absolutly beautiful looking. One of my favourite games off all time (I know, I say that a lot about any game I like).Just make sure your computer is WAY over the recommended specs as this game is VERY buggy and doesn't run well on lower end machines (the game hates some high end computers too).Still, if you're lucky and it runs well it will keep you hooked for ages :DDriving with a keyboad is a real pain, so make sure you have a gamepad or a steering wheel (I think you'll have the most fun with a wheel).

												Could have been a ckassic arcade racer. Instead the game is badly broken and should never have been released in this state. If onlly a few bugs had been fixed and the compulsory but tedious in the extreme 'race testing' removed, we would have a 'must have' game on our hands. It's a shame because they got so much right			"

												A game where you look at a launcher and cry. If you like buying a game and then not playing that game, then this is for you. It includes revolutionary gameplay modes such as loss of connection, patching failures and good ol' blue screens of death. If you manage to beat the game like I did after a windows reinstall, you get this pretty poor racing minigame which I didn't like very much. Altogether a solid 8/10.			"

												It's a very great game, it has a decent car list, mostly exotic cars, it has 2 huge islands (ibiza, hawaii), it has a lot of cars,  a vinyl editor, you can even buy a house and customize the house! also the online mode is not that bad, the servers are still brainded and sometimes get you in a session without your friend when you were just playing with him. overall it's a great game and can get you a lot of fun.. just don't expecct fun police chases and drifitng.. that ain't in.

												I don't feel this game deserves an in-depth review because it really isn't any good at all. I really did give this game a try, but I constantly get frustrated by the bad driving controls and overall ""clunky"" driving. At first it was do-able with the lower tier cars, but as I progressed further into the game and finally got myself a nice Pagani, it just got worse. I can't describe it well other than that you have to slow WAY down to even think about making a sharp turn without going off-road into a guardrail. And sometimes you will be driving and come upon part of the road where you can get some air, but when you do it is a terrible feeling, like the game doesn't want you to be doing huge jumps, so you land with an extremely unsatisfying ""thud"" and occasionally lose control.You absolutely NEED a controller for this game. There are no exceptions when it comes to using the keyboard; it just doesn't work. And even still it will take you forever to get used to them, especially if you have played other racing games that actually have good controls.I also didn't bother to pay attention to the story, if there even is one. The voice acting is really bad and the character animations aren't smooth and look bad as well. It was actually embarrasing. They even went so far as to re-use the same dumb dialogue before starting a race, after finishing driving school, and so on.That's another thing that was absolutely irritating was the driving schools. The handling of some of the driving school cars are even worse than anything else in the game. You can actually just hold down the gas upon starting and the car will spin out in a matter of seconds. It took me many, many tries to pass the completely pointless driving schools, and by the way, you won't use several of the ""driving techniques"" they teach you in them.The AI of everything in this game (other racers, the police, traffic) can either be really stupid or completely normal. Do NOT bother with the cops in this game because it is ridiculous. Once you get into a chace you better be ready to face 10+ police vehicles come at you head on or slam into you. You cannot ram them off-road, you cannot disable them. If you hit one you are basically screwed because it's like hitting a brick wall. You also can't go off-road yourself or else the helicopter will just randomly arrest you SOMEHOW, even with no cop cars around. You HAVE TO stay on the road.I was also excited (at first) to see that they had the Corvette ZR1 and some other really cool cars, but guess what? It's DLC that you can no longer purchase. Why put the car in the dealership in the first place if it's just DLC? However, they managed to get a couple things right in this game. The open world is quite nice and very large, allowing you to take nice cruises or just go extremely fast on straight roads. It is detailed, along with all the vehicles, and the game does have nice graphics. There is a decent selection of cars that you can put decals on and re-paint, although the decals are EXTREMELY limited and it is a pain to put them on.Overall, this game is frustrating. The bad controls, occasionally dumb AI, driving school, and several other things contribute to this frustration. Maybe I will give this another try sometime but for now I will not recommend it to anyone, as it is no longer being supported and really needs to be patched. 5/10.			"

Driving physics are poor, the story (what I bothered playing of it) seemed really cliché, the voice acting is awful and the story forces itself onto you when you just wanna drive around and explore.

Even after downloading the game on Steam, you have to download another 1.7GB through the game before it will play. Even then, you have to register the game with Atari's servers, which may or may not be up: you just have to be lucky.There is no reason for you to buy this game.Do not buy it, under any circumstances.I would not buy it again, EVEN IF IT WAS FREE.You have been warned "

												After a long time of giving this game a chance I can finally put it to rest! What could have been a fantastic open world racer ended up being a poor excuse with lackluster handling that made any other game better! However using a steering wheel and triple screens along with the in-game scenery and exploration kept me coming back until I recently bought a new wheel setup - the Thrustmaster TX with T3PA Pedals and TH8A Shifter. Of course, naturally, in true 'TDU2' form, it didn't recognise the setup! Seeking out a new and better open world racer I decided to finally purchase 'The Crew', it's handling model is nothing to boast about but then again, neither was 'TDU2's'!!!TDU2 is not recommended to anyone wanting a great open world racer on PC - 'TDU1' is still better and 'The Crew' really does compete with it's expansive world and pretty awesome customisation!

												physics are a bit strange, while its fun in itself its not realistic. customization fell horribly short of what i wanted, you can change your cars color, stickers, sometimes rims and thats it visually, very few upgrade possibilites, its very linear tier 1- 3, there are real cars but no real parts, which i found strange. you can go off roading in this game, which they actually did very well, but there are very few rally cars in the game with which to do so, and the rally cars that do exist, fall short due to the inability to upgrade them for dirt track use, everything in the game seems to have been pre-tuned for street use. you cannot use the keyboard with this game, at the very least you need an xbox controller - you can use a racing wheel but the tuning options are almost useless. aside from the physics, poor story, and lack of customization its a cool simulator, everything is very detailed, its just not a realistic smulator. i am by no means a professional driver, but i have done amatuer rally, and ive been to several tracks in NYS, with a Subaru Forester (in which i am furious this game does not have, it is an excellent rally vehicle)			"

												The game Test Drive Unlimited 2 in my eyes is not worth buying.  There are so many better racing games on Steam.  And also If you want a reason not to buy this game it is because the standard driving controls are the arrow keys.  and also the controls can have your hands stretching across the keyboard.  But also there are some good things about this game,  And one of those things is the detail that the developers put into the cars.  But again in my opinion this game is not worth buying.  Thank You for taking the time to read this.  -R Nixon			"

												After a long time of giving this game a chance I can finally put it to rest! What could have been a fantastic open world racer ended up being a poor excuse with lackluster handling that made any other game better! However using a steering wheel and triple screens along with the in-game scenery and exploration kept me coming back until I recently bought a new wheel setup - the Thrustmaster TX with T3PA Pedals and TH8A Shifter. Of course, naturally, in true 'TDU2' form, it didn't recognise the setup! Seeking out a new and better open world racer I decided to finally purchase 'The Crew', it's handling model is nothing to boast about but then again, neither was 'TDU2's'!!!TDU2 is not recommended to anyone wanting a great open world racer on PC - 'TDU1' is still better and 'The Crew' really does compete with it's expansive world and pretty awesome customisation!

												I was so excited to play this game. Seriously, I was. Bought it with real money, sat down and stared at the 2 hour long downloading screen. Once it finished, I perked up and waited for DX and all that. Then, to my suprise, I got a launcher promting me to download another 1.07GB of files. I said ""****"" and then proceeded to wait another 30 mins. After that, it was finally done, the play button lit up and all. I couldn't wait, I closed my eyes and pressed the button, but when I opened them, I saw: NAT type Strict:Udpblocked. O.M.G. is what I thought, there's no way I'm not going to be able to play the game that I just bought, which was advertised to me no less. After fooling around with port forwarding and all that BS, I just did offline mode. It told me I would not be able to play online if I made this profile, which I did not care about, and I did it. I clicked play and guess what? Nothing happened. Then it hit me, wow! Holy ****! I've just been robbed!Edit: I got the game to work after spamming the play button a few thousand times. It's honestly quite a good game once you get it to work. Got on today and it stopped working again. Off to mash the play button, cheerio!			"

												Terrible, terrible game. Test Drive Unlimited is one of the best racing games ever made with excellent, near fantastic, handling of the cars. But with the sequel they have redone it all, and it is all for the bad. If you take a non off road car, off road there's a speed limiter, you simply cannot go past 100 km/h or whatever the speed was. It even goes for 4x4 cars that the game consider a street car. It's not that they start to handle super poorly or just start spinning, no no, they simply cannot go any faster.That's just the worst thing I remember. The overall handling was really poor as I recall it. Why I put over 100 hours in it I will never understand. I got it as a gift, I really wanted it to be fun and I had some friends that I played it with. But it was never any good. The only positive was probably addition of getting cash for driving ""dangerously"", I love that stuff! Guess the car customization was pretty decent as well. Now that TDU1 (servers) has been shut down for a long time, would it not be better to play TDU2 than no TDU at all? No. Leave it be.Edit: I might add this video of me just joining up with some random players in TDU1, having a blast, just cruising around. Nothing close to this is to be found in TDU2, the player base seem to be something completely different. No one ever seemed to have any interest in cruising around together. They either started bumping you or simply warp somewhere else. But yeah, this video captured some of my fondest memories from online gaming.

												Recommended for sure... and why?Well, it's an open world racing game. You've got acces to a big stash of cars, which you obviously have to buy with the in-game money you make. The cars themselves are very detailed, extrior and intrior. The roads you can ride on are big and amazing. Every country has it's own style (Ibiza, (Spain) and Hawaii). There are a lot of side activities to do, so that you can earn a good load of money and buy your dream car.Although there won't be any new updates, the game works pretty fine and has some DLC cars (where you have to pay for (Atari coins)).Like every game it has it's weak spots, and there are still things unfinished, bugged, missing etc..

												So, had to change my review as the game now plays after turning off almost all my other processes. I'll have to figure out which is doing it, but if you can't get it to launch try shutting down most of what you have running.A recommendation is still iffy as of now considering the it appears that gamepads are not supported leaving you to choose between awful keyboard controls or a driving wheel (which I haven't tested yet).

Now that I have it on PC, I can re-live those memories once again.But enough nostalgia, let's talk about TDU2.Test Drive Unlimited 2 is an open-world racing game set in Ibiza (and Oahu once you've progressed enough).I like to think of it as a racing RPG, as you can level up your character, and gain special perks, such as discounts, new haircuts, cars, etc.But in the end, where it really shines is in its multiplayer. You drive around with others in a game session, and they can challenge you to races, hang out in your house, and even make a club with you!In the end, I recommend this very much.			"

And also If you want a reason not to buy this game it is because the standard driving controls are the arrow keys.  and also the controls can have your hands stretching across the keyboard.  But also there are some good things about this game,  And one of those things is the detail that the developers put into the cars.  But again in my opinion this game is not worth buying.  Thank You for taking the time to read this.  -R Nixon			"

												After a long time of giving this game a chance I can finally put it to rest! What could have been a fantastic open world racer ended up being a poor excuse with lackluster handling that made any other game better! However using a steering wheel and triple screens along with the in-game scenery and exploration kept me coming back until I recently bought a new wheel setup - the Thrustmaster TX with T3PA Pedals and TH8A Shifter. Of course, naturally, in true 'TDU2' form, it didn't recognise the setup! Seeking out a new and better open world racer I decided to finally purchase 'The Crew', it's handling model is nothing to boast about but then again, neither was 'TDU2's'!!!TDU2 is not recommended to anyone wanting a great open world racer on PC - 'TDU1' is still better and 'The Crew' really does compete with it's expansive world and pretty awesome customisation!

												I bought this game a couple of months ago, and got a refund back. Do not buy this. Despite reading other reviews about Atari leaving the group, I could not play this at all. I tried, went on YT, diferent errors over and over. Tried to fix..nothing. Don't waste your $,buy a better game.			"

												I bought this game right when it was out. I loved it at the time, but now the game is sadly.. a big pile of crap. I would've vote it up as one of the best driving games as in, you got a humongous map, you got a generous number of vehicles which perform pretty well for an open world driving game, you got some nice graphics and a big plus at the time was the online system which let you challenge other people and get some fun out of the game. Now the game is totally unplayable as the servers are down and I don't believe someone will ever start them again + from yerterday my game doesn't want to start at all (and I tried all the install-reinstall the game, updates, drivers etc.)Long story short.. Do not buy this game anymore!			"

												so, you know those kinda days, when you get home from work, sick of the all ♥♥♥♥ going on and you feel like you need few moments just to sit the ♥♥♥♥ down and forget all on earth? Sure we all have those. TDU2 is an enormous world of 2 real but not 100% copied islands + not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but anyways around 80 cars. Everything this game features - brief and not that satisfying. The singleplayer campaign and the plot are purely for ""well, at least they are there"", multiplayer is not really popular - whole system is messed up and nobody really plays ranked races. Gameplay most of the time stale and similar to what you were doing a week ago - just driving. Well, on those days I mentioned above, there is some reason to put some chill music on, take a PS3 controller, put Steam into Big Screen and for a few hours seamlessly roam around,  slowly taking over the completion of the game. This ♥♥♥♥ is atmospherical and cheap, which is good. Also it once had a large mod community which improved the game, fixed bugs, added cars and done a lot of useful thing, but setting all this to work will require some very reasonable time, which is bad. And when I say some time - I literally mean few days, not only installing mods but also making the account and activating the game is a cluster♥♥♥♥ due to server down times + the whole system being buggy. Of course, you can play out of the box, right after you install it, without all patching. Out of games like this, for which I can find only one example of The Crew, this is the best. Some anger tho' is inevidable cuz making it to work will really take some time. But nothing more, than those days. But I can't say for sure, maybe you could find something in it for yourself. TL;DR: not really worth, but sometimes comes handy.			"

												Where do I begin...The handling, the traffic, the police, the races, the oppo-Honestly, I don't even know.All I thought this game was, was a free roam, test drive-car game.No racing, no licenses, no buying cars. I guess I was wrong.What do you do in the game?Race jerks, get hassled by jerks- yep, jerks -what else..nothing.It's not until you get rich- $666666666 -that you can actually free roam.  It is just stupid. Who names a racing game 'Test Drive Unlimited? It had me under the impression that you test driveexotic and muscle cars, and drive around an expansive map, with no limits... no cops... no races... no economy...just nothing- except cars of course -don't be fooled.You might be saying ""You only have 5 hours record! You know nothing!!!""Sure, say it.But that's certainly enough time to regret buying this game.At least add an option to free roam only...No racing, etc.--No. Just no.Don't waste your money.If you're looking for a good racing game.. get this- just kidding -get Project CARS or something.If you're looking for a good free roam car game.. don't get this.Get 'Driving Simulator' or 'City Car Driving', etc.			"

												I dont know what the issues are with everyone and the servers, the game is fine for me, BUT i will say this.If you are looking for a simulation driving game, this is not it.Although i have only played 30 hours, i can tell you, around 25 of those are me just yelling at the screen at how bad the control is of a vehicle with a steering wheel. The clutch is broken (it works like a button) the gears on the cars are wonky (The camaro does around 200 kmh in 3rd gear with around 5000 RPM) and the force feedback is almost non apparent.Instead of treating the steering wheel AS a steering wheel it treats it as a controller with buttons, there is no level of how linear the pedals can be, only a delay which makes the controls awful, because its either full throttle when the pedal pushed about 4 millimeters and the brakes are just hell on earth, because the brakes are always on full becuase it treats the pedals like buttons, the brake lights dont even turn on unless the pedal is pushed down to a certain area, this also means the brakes will have been pushed 2 millimeters and you will have gone from 120 kmh to about 50 in 0.4 seconds. And the clutch, that pile of ♥♥♥♥ that is! I have not seen anything as terrible as this! the brakes and accelerator, i could manage, nearly, but the clutch is absolute rubbish! Once again its an on or off scenario, but at least with this one it has to be fully depressed to activate (but with all the goods this game has it has its bad) but in order for the clutch to be released it has to go all the way back up, there is no half way point, this means that a take off is impossible, you can rev the engine to its redline and take the clutch off and the car will either (depending on what car it is) A:Do a burnout or B:The revs will drop below 1000 and you will be yelling at the screen because of the slow take off.Now the gear ratios are my final bit of this rant, the are all over the flipping place, some cars have 1st gear that goes to 20, others to 100, now THIS is the icing on the cake of dog ♥♥♥♥ that this game calls 'handling'. The camaro has 6 gears, around 3 of which you will not bother to use, because once you get over 120 kmh, handling becomes so bad that if you take your foot off the accelerator and turn the wheel at a slow pace, you will not move. If you have been in a real car and done this you WILL move, but this game is just broken in the handling scripts. now on some cars this is different, but the experience is much the same.To some up (and to add) the game is good for a keyboard user, and even though being considered a racing sim, its more of an arcade derby because the controls make it feel that way and also you cant control the car most of the time so you're going to crash into other cars. Bad at least the sounds are decent...			"

												This game is really really really fun. It's a pretty game and you drive around pretty islands in your cool cars. It's fun to just drive around. That is why my friends and I call this game ""Drive Around.""The really bad thing is that the servers are often ♥♥♥♥ed up and that prevents the game from running at all. You'll get stuck on the loading screen. This is really annoying. However, you can work around the issue by disabling your internet connection and ignoring multiple error and warning messages, and your game will then start in Offline mode.			"

												The game is good but the problem I have is that the multiplayer aspect is really hard to get into being 2015 (which is understandable I suppose since the game is getting very close to 5 years old which would probably make reviewing the game kind of redundant- the last news update for the game was after holiday 2014 restoring the servers). Also a little unrelated to the game is signing up to make an account with TDU2... it's not as easy as it would seem for whatever reason. I signed up on their site, and used it on the game when I first got it open but it seems that I have two accounts under the same user name (how dows that even work?) because I can play the game online but when I check on my profile on testdriveunlimited2.com it says I don't have the game. Also I have DLC for a Zonda in-game but I have no clue on how to redeem it because I could redeem it on TDU2 but I don't want to do that because inputting the key for the game on the site does not work because I redeemed it with Steam. I suppose there is a way to redeem it on Steam but I've not seen a way to do it in-game.The servers don't seem to be online most of the time and when they are I've began fearing getting disconnected from said servers (I just got in a second time while playing and got disconnected near the end of a event- so not cool).There is offline mode, which works fine. The game kind of emulates being online with other players that are AI controlled (I really thought at first that they were actual players at first). However to be honest, I got this game for the sole purpose of playing with friends and running single player kind of takes away my whole purpose of wanting the game. If only I had gotten the game when it was new, the servers would probably still be up and (possibly) lively but then again a games luster wears off quickly these days, especially if the game is older.To be honest I really don't want to down-vote the game because even with the connecting to server problems I've been having the game is good I but I feel that I have to not recommend on the grounds of me coming into the game to play with friends and because of how the servers seem to be off and on there isn't really much I can recommend asides for playing the game offline.

												Do you constantly like seeing error messages when you try start a game? Crashes on startup for no apparent reason? Finally getting the game to work only to have it sit in a looped sequence that you cant interact with? TDU2 won't disappoint you then! Oh hang on, the game has finally started. What do you mean ""has to be launched from Steam"". How the f*** do you think I launched it? Doesnt have a full cone? Someone definately had some full cones when they released this as a completed game.Most of my listed play time has been spent restarting the game. Glad that I only paid about $5.00 for it.			"

												The Pros:The open world maps are pretty nice.The car list is okay.If you like arcade-style physics in racing games, this game is for you!50/50:The graphics themselves are nice but some cars have less detailed interior.The Cons:The story is boring.The soundtrack is mostly ♥♥♥♥ & just makes you wanna switch off the radio.THE VOICELINES HOLY SH**.Overall, buy it when it's really cheap.

												Very disappointed to find out that one of the racing games I really liked (in spite of the -let's be honest- crappy driving model) for the open world and way it went about everything has gone down the drain. I really hoped for ""The Crew"" to be the next TDU, but apparently, the driving is lacking in tightness in that game too. I guess the PC Forza game with an open world won't come too soon. SAD FACE!

Test Drive Unlimited 2 seemed like the perfect racing game for me. Two large islands, an interesting selection of cars, a mix between arcade and simulation style driving and true open-world gameplay. Add to that the idea of actually buying appartments and garages to store your cars in, instead of simply having infinite garage space. It sounded great. And fun!However that ""dream racing game"" fell flat on its knees as soon as I had my first set of wheels. The reason for that was that I, at that moment, got to meet the game's biggest flaw: The driving physics.I know that you're in some games supposed to fiddle around with the driving settings to suit them to your taste and driving style and I did, or rather I tried.Every few hours I would change them a bit, hoping I would get closer to a setup I liked. I also tried so called recommended settings by several users on the Steam community or from the web, but none of them worked for me so far.And it's not like I played the game only for a few hours.I played it for 48 hours. In that time I went through the beginning parts of the ""story"" two times. The first time was pretty horrible, but the second time was even worse.I get it, as a developer you want to connect your gameplay through a story, but it sincerely doesn't help one bit if every character you meet is annoying and arrogant to the point where I can't stand them, even when they're loosing.Also the story isn't that original, too. Through luck you're taking part in the Solar Crown, a highly-regarded competition between drivers on Ibiza and Hawaii.I think the game would have been better without a story.The problem with this championship is that you'll drive against the same characters again and again. And their cutscenes before and after a race are pretty much the same every time.So not only are you going up against the same drivers again and again, there's also no pay-off after you beat them. Sure, you get their car if you beat them in a one on one race, but what does it matter if they're driving against you in the next race!?It also doesn't help that I was fighting my own vehicle more often than the other drivers.Because that is how it often felt to me. I could easily outrun the enemies, some races I would overtake the whole group several times and be several laps ahead.But every corner I pretty much had to fight my own vehicle to the point where it wasn't fun. And it's not like I completely suck at driving. I know how to drive a line, break and how to take corners...And after nearly 40 hours I couldn't take the story and the competition anymore.So I did what I like to do the most in open-world racers: I grabbed my set of wheels and took in the scenery.I spent the remaining hours of my playtime driving through both islands, simply exploring the world, chasing down highways, going down dead-end streets. Simply not caring for anything but my car and the road.However as much as I tried to not play the story or the races, the driving physics didn't change (obviously). Realizing this, that I wasn't enjoying what should be the core of any driving game, I simply uninstalled Test Drive Unlimited 2 and I sincerely doubt that I'll ever play it again.Sure, it's somewhat MMO like online mode, where you can meet other players randomly or some of the social stuff, for example you can actually ride inside other player's cars, are neat ideas.But a driving game should first and foremost do one thing: Be fun driving!And after 48 hours it just still isn't, despite me trying many varations of driving modes, settings and cars.So I cannot, despite me liking the ideas behind Test Drive Unlimited 2 and what it tried to do, recommend this game.

												The exotic cars are awesome, but the physics are not. Some of the license tests are frustrating as all hell, and the game pretty much forces you to pick specific cars for some races because picking anything else will screw you. There are some nifty features and the exploration is neat, but the license tests and the physics can be frustrating. If anything, get this on sale because it IS fun to drive Ferraris and Aston Martins at 200 mph down the freeway and being able to test drive any car is a great feature.			"

I can win every race that actualy has other drivers in it first try , but the timed events are almost impossible ( computer players cheat ) and some of the licence tests are so easy it's funny and others put you in a car that doesn't handle worth ♥♥♥♥ and ask you to find that impossible speed and line to finnish a test . If there was only a second difference i would just call that player error but when the difference is being 30 seconds ahead on one race only to find yourself 12 seconds behind in the next race . If you want a cheap game that lets you drive around and find stuff than its a very good game if you are looking for a racing simulater than don't bother you will be dissapointed .			"

The sheer number of cars to choose from and the cockpit view, as well as the awesome pads you get to store your cars are an added bonus, as is the interaction with other AI players. The ability to adjust things in the car, as well as the graphics make it a real winner. I wish they would make more car games like this.			"

The feel the G27 has on this game is really realistic and enjoyable. I have spent many hours playing this game on the playstation but i am enjoying it a lot more on the pc.

												First off, I would highly recommend that people should purchase this game, but only if you are a fan of the racing genre, and have windows 7. The reason why I am not recommending game in the actual review component is because of the following.I love this game, the gameplay, the open world, the first person view both in cars and in buildings, but I could love it A LOT MORE. It lags so hard on windows 8.1 (Does anyone else have this problem?). The only way I can fix this is by setting the CPU affinity to only one core, but that makes the sound go all funny and weird. Just saying the my GTX 650 CAN HANDLE TDU2 on max graphics at 60fps. I would probably downgrade to Windows 7, but its expensive to get another Windows licence etc etc etc... If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated. :)My PC Specs:Windows 8.1 64bitNvidia GTX 650Intel i5-3330 @ 3.00 GHz Overclocked to 3.40GHz "

												So, TDU was a pretty good game. Unsurprisingly, Atari and Eden went to make a sequel.Somewhere, they forgot that a driving game should be about the driving.The nature of this game would dictate arcade handling - being able to change direction fairly quickly without losing control. Unfortunately, what you get is fairly poor, as vehicles tend to slide.Somewhere along the line, the game got lost under the extras that got thrown in - the story, the *extra* collectibles, the casino... OK, they're nice extras, but all they are is extras. The action is in the driving, and when that is sub-par, it negatively impacts the entire game.It's no great surprise that Eden and Atari failed not too long after the release of this game.			"

If you want decent racing game go for some Need for Speed, if you want open world than go for GTA but avoid this piece of cr**p.			"

												I've owned TDU since it was released and played it through all its glitches on my XP/7 system and now on my Win8-8.1 system (fewer issues now). The scenic and vehicle aesthetic qualities are definitely TDU and TDU 2's best positives. Not so much on the AI or driving mechanics, but that's okay as long as you're not looking for a race sim or intend on making every corner/challenge with perfection. I find it interesting that some of the slower/cheaper cars seem to have much better handling than the more extravagant ones in TDU 2; that's just strange. But all-in-all, a very fun and visually-appealing game to play around in, especially using Nvidia 3D Vision 2!			"

												It is neither as technical as any Codemasters game, nor as friendly-driven and arcade like Burnout and last Need for Speed iterations. But it has somewhat that you may have very fun (maybe the european approach made the game seems like that).It is an open-world driving game. As a valet driver, you basically do a bulk of events (including driving permission tests) from where you earn cash and experience. You have to win all the regional events (each one ends as a challenge against one of your rivals) in order to match a final ""island grand cup"", both in Ibiza and Hawaii islands (starting on first one).The soundtrack and the scenario modeling are the superb things. It is a very nice environment, beautifully shaped. But the character modeling is pretty bad, although (both graphically and about dialogues).The gameplay is reasonable. With a ""PS2-like controller"", you will have all the controls you need. The game is responsive and controlling the car is relatively easy. Maybe game menus are a little tricky sometimes, but it is a thing easily to be used to.The game has a overall moderate challenging factor. The simulation factor is not high. You cannot make a turn reckessly with your car in some categories, but when you master that (it's a little hard), you beat all championships easily. Maybe the greatest difficulty of game is finding the right car for the right event. Besides each model and its features, you must find the brand's sellers through the HUGE scenarios. There are many of the great high-level car brands (some are missing, likely due lack of agreements with manufacturers). You must explore both islands to complete the tasks given to you, find shops, enter championships and even to find multiplayer spots.You can customize your character (clothes and plastic surgery), your car (tuning, painting and so on) and the houses/manors you can buy.By the way, multiplayer is gradually being abandoned, but you will find people doing some weird things (like races that the fastest lap was one second...).The DLC's are not recommended. A couple of cars (not available in-game and has nothing effectively different from what you can purchase on the scenarios' stores) and a Casino that you may earn some cash to buy things. Both are expensive.You may have some fun. It's not a mind-blow. The game has a soft and relaxing mood sometimes due it's soundtrack and the locations chosen. Maybe it was intentional.			"

												TDU2 a amazing game to play with your friends and to just have a good time with them revolutionary graphics and awesome car details, in short words completely amazing.Now that was my review on the game when it first launched on Xbox 360 back in the days, now its a completely diffrent game.I saw it was on sale and I thought: Why not?, It was terrific on Xbox 360 so then its got to be even better on PC, unfortunatly I was terribly wrong.Even the developers think this game was so bad that they decided to pull the plug on it making it impossible to get proper support or to play online with anyone which removes like half of the whole experience of the game making it really boring and just another one of those games that you will regret that you have bought.So in short words you can see this game like a strong superhuman that has been batteling lots of illneses and still been able to deliver joy and happines to millions of people around the world, unfortunatly it catched a illness so bad that its eating it from the inside out.Its relatives have decided to not support it anymore they have just simply decided to pull the plug on it and left it to die in a dark abandonned room somewhere never to be restored to its former glory again.Rest in peace my friend, I will always remeber the happy moments you gave me and my friends.Would not recommend 4/10			"

												Ever hear a game described as a similar game but on crack? Well this game is like Burnout on a horse tranquilizer. Buyers Remorse Unlimited 2 removes all forms of possible fun by punishing the players for going off track, interacting with other cars, smashing into objects or doing anything remotely interesting. I wasn't just bored driving towards the races in the huge dull map I was bored in them, it is always hold accelerate, practically park when you see a corner to turn then back to holding accelerate. The only fun to be had is either in dicking around indoors like its Playstation Home or playing bumper cars with other players that also want to make the game feel less like Car Similator 2011.			"

												I've owned TDU since it was released and played it through all its glitches on my XP/7 system and now on my Win8-8.1 system (fewer issues now). The scenic and vehicle aesthetic qualities are definitely TDU and TDU 2's best positives. Not so much on the AI or driving mechanics, but that's okay as long as you're not looking for a race sim or intend on making every corner/challenge with perfection. I find it interesting that some of the slower/cheaper cars seem to have much better handling than the more extravagant ones in TDU 2; that's just strange. But all-in-all, a very fun and visually-appealing game to play around in, especially using Nvidia 3D Vision 2!			"

												The exotic cars are awesome, but the physics are not. Some of the license tests are frustrating as all hell, and the game pretty much forces you to pick specific cars for some races because picking anything else will screw you. There are some nifty features and the exploration is neat, but the license tests and the physics can be frustrating. If anything, get this on sale because it IS fun to drive Ferraris and Aston Martins at 200 mph down the freeway and being able to test drive any car is a great feature.			"

												There are a lot of positive and negative reviews of this game and they are both mostly spot on, I really like the game, but, this short review will tell you specifically why I don't recommend that you spend any money on the game, at all.I am a recent purchaser of the game, I picked it up late in 2014. I have a high number of hours in the game because, when it works, despite issues, it's fun. The problem is simple: the game is too dependent on Atari's servers and they are up and down constantly, lately, more down than up.  I would wait at least six months before buying this game to see if Atari demonstrates that they are commited to keeping the game running.			"

Its not steams fault although things between them and Atari and/or Eden Games should have been rectified before rereleasing this game.			"

												Played on xbox360 was really fun. Tried to buy, download, and play on PC and I was asked to visit the website and activate my product and link it with steam. I tried to and was told the product key had been used. It says I played 19 minutes, but it was all loading screen. Game never opened. Forced to return.			"

												Ever hear a game described as a similar game but on crack? Well this game is like Burnout on a horse tranquilizer. Buyers Remorse Unlimited 2 removes all forms of possible fun by punishing the players for going off track, interacting with other cars, smashing into objects or doing anything remotely interesting. I wasn't just bored driving towards the races in the huge dull map I was bored in them, it is always hold accelerate, practically park when you see a corner to turn then back to holding accelerate. The only fun to be had is either in dicking around indoors like its Playstation Home or playing bumper cars with other players that also want to make the game feel less like Car Similator 2011.			"

The offical forums are down so no explanation has been released, even on steams forums or the official facebook page.  3rd party DRM means you can install this game on 4 pc's, had i seen that i would have never bought the game. It now seems theres a lack of keys for people and the steam forum is full of people waiting for them.

The game itself had a awesome potential, throwed on the garbage as always, get the money and run style. Atari is not a good game company anymore, i feel worse about the money i paid on this game than when i was robbed on the street some time ago, because the robber didn't promised anything for the money it took, and this game did. and if you ever need any help or technical support from atari web site or tickets... you ain't gonna have any answer.-------> In case you dont want to read it all <------------ Dont Buy			"

												If this game had a smell it would be similar to that of old buttplugs dumped in sulpheric acid and stuck up your nose. So in other words, this game smells painfully bad.Gameplay: Cars, 3/10Graphics: tis shiny, 6/10Physics: Gran Turismo, 2/10Sound: vroom sounds. 6/10Story: uh, 0.125/10The first few minutes of gameplay consists of you choosing a pre-made character to play as during your amazing birthday party with a dumb chick outside of your expensive modern home. Dumb chick shows you a Ferrari she bought you. You drive the Ferrari down the road a bit and, WHOA! loud speaking, like dumb chick is trying to get your attention. Surprise; you're dreaming while asleep in the dumb chick's Ferrari. You're actually a poor racer-wannabe vallet dude working for this dumb chick's parents (or maybe that hotel you start at). That said, the dumb chick is waking you up and throws a tantrum and calls her dad. As you're about to lose your job, she realizes she's too dumb and a chick to drive her 483 horsepower sports car, so she makes you drive her to the race meet. As a reward, dumb chick let you race at said race meet. Shocking.You win, blah blah, first car, blah, some races, end of game, grats. Oh, and you obviously make money from each race, but once you beat the game your only source of income is driving fast, and racing online which I've never tried because the rest of the game is aids.Final rating: 3.4 std's/ 10 dumb chicks			"

												After many hours spent with the original Test Drive, I was pretty excited to see this on steam. Bought it right away, excited for more Test Drive action.Boy was I wrong. It doesn't get even close when I describe the DRM as excessive. Apart from the key it requires an account on a now dead tdu2.com website. Even after painstakingly completing the creation process for one, it took several attempts before it let me log in. After finally launching the actual game I played for some 10 minutes before it crashed. Upon restarting, the launcher indicated that there is a problem with my internet connection and refused to start the game. After this went on for a few tries, I refunded the game and returned to playing, albeit only single-player, original Test Drive.			"

												I could only say you need to google it up in multiple review sites to get all the pieces together. You'll see why it sucks so badly. I could go on but knowing myself I'd probably go on for 100 lines of disrecommending.I'll go on with a few annoying things that occured to me in the game.Marcus (Something) after you're on your way for a championship, after a license... :""Hey little guy, it's Marcus, Listen, I don't remember teaching you all these techniques so you can just quit. The track awaits!""Me: rrrrghhh... Really? REALLY!!? I'm, like, at 20 F-----' meters from the ENTRY ICON down the road!! DON'T FRIGGIN' CALL ME NOW! My GPS is already targeting what you want me to, for cryin' out loud!!Other occurences of the such happen when you're at 30 KM (18.7Miles) away and you don't have a choice but to slog your way there, and all the time they're gonna call you and cuss you out for not making it here in a minute or so.The multiplayer sucks just as much, and so does the free-roam and instant challenge... and don't think you'll have a good time on your non-single player mode intended bike, or you'll be disappointed. people will ram you off, doesn't matter if they're 12, 20 ,30 years old or whatever. They'll ram the hell out of you. Bike or not, which means they're gonna get in their SUVs and block your road. If you're in a low speed car, avoid setting online interactions to ""On"" since it's just not worth it.About the instant challenge part, it's not even instant. On offline mode, the game shoves a random road down your throat and it's up to you to beat a C4 Lancia Delta(Classic 4 car class, AKA slow clunkers since the amount of upgrades in this game, simply put, sucks. more on that below.) Lancia Delta with your A4 Camaro (Asphalt 4 class, which divides into 7 categories. A4 Is middle of the road speed, with abysmal handling cars often) because it'll get a massive speed boost and it'll ram you.Online instant challenges are purgatory in terms of annoyance, you'll be purposedly rammed by the opponent players and if you've got a small car versus an SUV, you can expect you'll be blocked to a point where you'll wonder why this game mode even exists offline AND online!You try to get past the traffic? Nope. Even the traffic cars are evil, they'll speed up to intercept you, sometimes they spin out to try to avoid you but they'll often spin out in YOUR direction. With extreme convoy events, you'll lose a ton of your pay and that's if you're even lucky enough for the clean-driving meter to not empty.But why keep going on when the prize cash is just *419$ (*Referencial number to mean ""Junk"") and that the retries're infinite?You made it to the finish area before retrying? Congratulations, you just lost all your means of retrying this events. But who cares!? You've got better to do! Like grinding 1.6 million credits'ish to get a bugatti after you've spent stuff on cosmetic surgery (which makes your character looks like a donkey, and can only be applied to his already --gly face.) and got all your furniture.Oh wait, I'll use this trick...

Cool, It's starting to lower. OH NO! It's almost full since I collided with a few road-side light cylinders which aren't even lit during night time!! Okay, I'm gonna park my car aside of the road and cool my nerves down. Hey, the meter's going down. (Traffic car arrives behind) what the... OH NO IT'S FULL!!! They're targetting me!!! I'll go and hide!! (Hides in a GPS-wide wheat field) whew. (Finally empties) What a pursuit!!Oh wait it wasn't.Asphalt club races are NOTHING but but Bugatti Veyron ram-to-win contests. Both clubs're gonna ram each others' cars to the finishing line. Either this or a Buggy V8 (Which is super ugly and hard to drive, especially in the rain.)May the dirtiest win a few points toward their endless grind for a level 3 club... either this or take away 50,000$ off the instant challenge's unfortunate loser.Now I mentioned sooner there are license tests before? WHY, just WHY would there be license tests when richa-- illegal race events are the main focus?Mastery points were so much better.This game gets a big 5 out of 5 F.U. rating from me. (A la Wreckless Eating)Don't buy it, It's not worth your time.I know this whole b----ing review is about an outdated game, but still I needed to let my anger out.I'mma go get an infusion, a Vachon cake and chill out taking a walk in the neighborhood.Jumpin' outta subject for a bit...........Best way for me to get a break from such a hidden hell in what Marcus (The A license guy/ Whatever again) calls the rich mens' heaven is to do something you'll know will be enjoyable, and look, my PS Vita gave me Distance points in Disgaea 3 AoD for bringing my console with me and playing it while I walk around.Now THAT's enjoyable.But then I feel the need to come back and keep trying on and on and on and... you get the point.

												I can't recommend this game for most people.That said, it's one of my favorite games to just cruise, (say, after some GTA, or a real driving sim) and there are a handful of cars that drive well. It's not entriely acracde, nor simulation. This game really dumbs down, well, everything. The acting, animations and premises are stiff, emotionless and basically only serve to illustrate why this game failed so miserablely on release. It's the age-old, tried to do so many things, that it can't do anything well. It's pretty, as long as you don't look to hard, and it's fun if you're not expecting much. There's a lot that is just frustrating. Somehow, I've managed to log a couple hundred hours on this game despite all it's faults. Probably for lack of a suitable alternative.The Good:Being able to roam to 'real' islands.Quite a few cars, some are even good to drive.Somewhat pretty, if dated.The Bad:Online play sucks, when it works, populated by tools.Console-audience focused development is obvious.Single-player racing, while passable, is pretty uninspired.Some of the vehicle dynamics, like the consideration of torque curve vs horsepower curve or lack of adjustability in cars that have it from the factory, much less would get it as soon as you started swapping parts.The Ugly:All the non driving-related fluff. Poor tuning and performance options.Overall lack of diversity in traffic, there will be the same density of cars on dead-ends as freeways, day or night, rain or shine.Nagging NPCs, GPS and feature commentary.Some notable marquees are absent, while you can't help notice others.

												There are a lot of positive and negative reviews of this game and they are both mostly spot on, I really like the game, but, this short review will tell you specifically why I don't recommend that you spend any money on the game, at all.I am a recent purchaser of the game, I picked it up late in 2014. I have a high number of hours in the game because, when it works, despite issues, it's fun. The problem is simple: the game is too dependent on Atari's servers and they are up and down constantly, lately, more down than up.  I would wait at least six months before buying this game to see if Atari demonstrates that they are commited to keeping the game running.			"

This is a game that had potential that has been taken down piece by piece just by the dev's decision to not include wheel support.

												Test Drive is not really a bad game, just mediocre at best. The scenery was eye-popping at some points but most of the time was bland, and it just looked like a huge island with random hills and trees. The characters need alot more improvement- their expressions are dead, and their acting is ANNOYING. Their acting is repetitive and it doesn't even fit the character. Besided the sub-par animation on the characters, the graphics on the car is decent. It gives it the shiny touch and you can look at its decent interior. The island is massively huge and gives it alot of anticipation to explore, but like I said, details. One thing I like about this game is that you can create your own house and you can travel from Hawaii, to Ibiza. That is like a dream come true, but the looking around and the driving mechanics are coarse and gives it the Sims feel. I'm not sure if I mentioned that this game is often buggy, and the servers go down from time to time. It gets really annoying.                     Besides from all of the cons, there were some pros that I liked, but this game seriously needs improvement, and eden needs to fix the damn servers. The idea of this game was very amazing, but it just didn't hit me and I didn't quite get the experience I wanted. Do I recommend the game? No because it is not worth 19.99. 6 and lower is a better price.			"

												The game is good but the problem I have is that the multiplayer aspect is really hard to get into being 2015 (which is understandable I suppose since the game is getting very close to 5 years old which would probably make reviewing the game kind of redundant- the last news update for the game was after holiday 2014 restoring the servers). Also a little unrelated to the game is signing up to make an account with TDU2... it's not as easy as it would seem for whatever reason. I signed up on their site, and used it on the game when I first got it open but it seems that I have two accounts under the same user name (how dows that even work?) because I can play the game online but when I check on my profile on testdriveunlimited2.com it says I don't have the game. Also I have DLC for a Zonda in-game but I have no clue on how to redeem it because I could redeem it on TDU2 but I don't want to do that because inputting the key for the game on the site does not work because I redeemed it with Steam. I suppose there is a way to redeem it on Steam but I've not seen a way to do it in-game.The servers don't seem to be online most of the time and when they are I've began fearing getting disconnected from said servers (I just got in a second time while playing and got disconnected near the end of a event- so not cool).There is offline mode, which works fine. The game kind of emulates being online with other players that are AI controlled (I really thought at first that they were actual players at first). However to be honest, I got this game for the sole purpose of playing with friends and running single player kind of takes away my whole purpose of wanting the game. If only I had gotten the game when it was new, the servers would probably still be up and (possibly) lively but then again a games luster wears off quickly these days, especially if the game is older.To be honest I really don't want to down-vote the game because even with the connecting to server problems I've been having the game is good I but I feel that I have to not recommend on the grounds of me coming into the game to play with friends and because of how the servers seem to be off and on there isn't really much I can recommend asides for playing the game offline.

												First off, I would highly recommend that people should purchase this game, but only if you are a fan of the racing genre, and have windows 7. The reason why I am not recommending game in the actual review component is because of the following.I love this game, the gameplay, the open world, the first person view both in cars and in buildings, but I could love it A LOT MORE. It lags so hard on windows 8.1 (Does anyone else have this problem?). The only way I can fix this is by setting the CPU affinity to only one core, but that makes the sound go all funny and weird. Just saying the my GTX 650 CAN HANDLE TDU2 on max graphics at 60fps. I would probably downgrade to Windows 7, but its expensive to get another Windows licence etc etc etc...

Unsurprisingly, Atari and Eden went to make a sequel.Somewhere, they forgot that a driving game should be about the driving.The nature of this game would dictate arcade handling - being able to change direction fairly quickly without losing control. Unfortunately, what you get is fairly poor, as vehicles tend to slide.Somewhere along the line, the game got lost under the extras that got thrown in - the story, the *extra* collectibles, the casino... OK, they're nice extras, but all they are is extras. The action is in the driving, and when that is sub-par, it negatively impacts the entire game.It's no great surprise that Eden and Atari failed not too long after the release of this game.			"

												This game should never ever be created!!!Installation - with f*** Atari not easy!!!a) 3rd party SecuROM - why why why?! It is annoying for only those that own/buy the gameb) On-line function - I was unable to test them, ok what ever I  don't really care anymore!!!c) Updating - the game is updated through its own client (why Atari doesn't use Steam for this it is mystery to me).d) DLCs - if I am not mistaken than every publisher who wants its games on Steam must provide DLCs on steam as well - so why they have to be bought through the Atari/TDU2 website?!Gameplay - frustration over frustration!!!a)Loading - it asks you to press Start button however you need mouse and keyboard in order to change the controller for the game!!!b) Interface - not intuitive at all - who the f*** invented it!!!c) Driving model - it is impossible to drive straight, the car driving model is everything but not accurateThe only pro I found is that I was able to uninstall the game.NEVER EVER WILL SUPPORT ATARI AGAIN!!!Just a note: I demanded refund from Atari for this scr**w up.  If you want decent racing game go for some Need for Speed, if you want open world than go for GTA but avoid this piece of cr**p.			"

												-Runs like ♥♥♥♥-Looks like ♥♥♥♥ -Plays like ♥♥♥♥Spend your money elsewhere, the multiplayer is non-existent as the servers for even making your account is half-dead and the HTTPS certificate is almost a year expired. How about the single player? Supposedbly narrative driven, but the voice acting is borderline bad. The handling of the cars when it rains feels like you're skating on ice with a 3 tonne hunk of metal. Looks incredibly dated, runs horribly at about +/- 20 fps at a a computer that can run Dirt 3 at almost maxed which looks way better.Conclusion? Spend your money elsewhere, no redeeming features and the developers seemed to have died.			"

												What was a good game has been destroyed for me by complete lack of customer support and ignorance. I have bought the game TWICE and couldn't even access my old account on which I did most content of the game. Attempts to reset the password were foiled because of the lacking maintenance on their website, and I'm still waiting for a customer service, TWO YEARS after contecting them. Maybe Atari got their ♥♥♥♥ together as of now, but I still suggest go buy The Crew instead. It's the better game of the two anyways.			"

												The game has a launcher that takes 2 minutes to test your connection. And most of the time the server isn't even up. Even when the server IS up it will tell you in-game that you are offline and still can't participate in most events.There are no subtitle options in game. I don't like having game sound turned on so I never know what people are saying in the cutscenes.When the game starts it automatically turns down the sound volume of anything already running on your system. This should never happen with any game, if I want my volume turned down I would do it myself.The driving physics are bad, even for an arcade racer.The AI drivers are immovable objects. If they hit you, you will just be pushed aside while they continue on unfazed. If you bump into them, it's like rubbing against a wall, they just keep going like nothing has happened. It's pretty funny when you can get in front of one of them and slow down to let them just push you along.			"

												The game isnt the same as it used to be. Only way to get the dlc is to buy some worthless tokens/coins on their website and it  doesnt even work anymore so you can forget that, and they dont even offer all of them on the website. If you want a cop car you have to escape a chase against actual players 20 times, which never frickin happens. The game is barely maintained or updated anymore, Atari closed long ago but they still have to keep the game running for 2 more years which is stupid because they dont even give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game anymore. only around 6 or 8 players can be on each server. So no i don't recommend this game, unless they fix it.			"

												I originally wanted to like this game, having liked the concept of the first one and wanting a good open-world driving game. I heard all the negative feedback but decided to get it (two years after release) while it was cheap. Let's just say I'm glad I got it on sale.To start off, the game REALLY likes showing you the cutscenes and letting you hear the voice acting. The problem is that the human(oid) figures look like a high school student's class project and the voices sound like an obscure anime dub. I bought this game to drive, NOT to watch ReBoot. The terrain looks passable and didn't seem to be TOO distracting. As for the cars themselves, they look good for their time, but seem a bit too ""plastic-y"" and matte-finished. Normally you'd expect the driving to be the best attribute of a racing game, right? Well the driving here feels really stiff, more like the 2002 Test Drive iteration, and less like a game made in 2011. Cars either grip perfectly at insane speeds, or barely turn at all, which is a very bad business model for a car manufacturer.Soundtrack is a purely subjective thing, I know, but I personally don't think you could get more obscure, ear-violating, and volume-lowering music if you tried. The only saving grace is that one of the TWO stations plays electronic music that's actually tolerable as background noise.It's hard for me to say much about the optimization since I have newer hardware that could power through it, but I did get slight stutters every now and then on a GTX 670.Hindsight being 20/20, if I'd known that most of my 10 or so hours played would be spent tabbed out, I probably wouldn't have bothered.

												This was one of the most excellent games for cruising around aimlessly in beautiful scenery. The past tense there is important, as while the fantastic soundtrack holds up, the servers are now gone, the races are locked off behind infuriating driver's license tests, the handling is slippery and inconsistent, and the nostalgia just overall does not help this game now that many, many titles have built off of the precedent it set for open-world driving with much better physics. If you don't have an Xbox 360 to play Forza Horizon on, I guess this is almost a decent idea on a sale, but most of the point is lost now that competition's caught up and raced by.			"

												Test Drive is not really a bad game, just mediocre at best. The scenery was eye-popping at some points but most of the time was bland, and it just looked like a huge island with random hills and trees. The characters need alot more improvement- their expressions are dead, and their acting is ANNOYING. Their acting is repetitive and it doesn't even fit the character. Besided the sub-par animation on the characters, the graphics on the car is decent. It gives it the shiny touch and you can look at its decent interior. The island is massively huge and gives it alot of anticipation to explore, but like I said, details. One thing I like about this game is that you can create your own house and you can travel from Hawaii, to Ibiza. That is like a dream come true, but the looking around and the driving mechanics are coarse and gives it the Sims feel. I'm not sure if I mentioned that this game is often buggy, and the servers go down from time to time. It gets really annoying.                     Besides from all of the cons, there were some pros that I liked, but this game seriously needs improvement, and eden needs to fix the damn servers. The idea of this game was very amazing, but it just didn't hit me and I didn't quite get the experience I wanted. Do I recommend the game? No because it is not worth 19.99. 6 and lower is a better price.			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 offers an exceptionally beautiful and detailed representation of both Ibiza and Hawaii. The choices are endless and the gameplay is slick, addictive and keeps you coming back for more. Completing challenges keeps the game valid and interesting. The enonomy system in the game adds a nice twist by allowing the player to progress through a scale of ten levels based on their current speed and driving skill (any colisions reduce the bank back to zero). This encourages better driving and allows you to build up money quite easily. Cars and houses can be purchased too. All in all, TDU2 is an exceptional game			"

												Hey...you. Yeah, you. I see you checking out this game....wondering if it's any good. Well, no. It is not a good game. Hell, it's not even a working game really. Servers aren't online anymore, company is doing other things maybe? Not really sure. What I can tell you is that this game was more about being a social butterfly than a good driving game. I'm Not Sure, but I remember the Test Drive series as a kid being a most excellent set of games and this one surely failed to deliver.  And on that note I'd say this game has some really heartfelt and pretty graphics when it comes to the noice choice of cahs. (Which cannot be said about the character looks.) Racing games on PC being what it is, I bought this afterschool special to try out. I soon felt odd and out of place as soon as I started playing, to be honest, and when I won my first car I thought maybe I had been Rick Rolled in a wierd mustangy sort of way.  I haven't put to much effort into playing this game. Graphic wise, it's a damn fine looking game. Playablility is the same as a northern cousin....no go. Overall I'd give this game a -3.5 and a heartfelt stick for the steam sales crew for leaving this broke down old junker on sale.			"

												I can't recommend this game for most people.That said, it's one of my favorite games to just cruise, (say, after some GTA, or a real driving sim) and there are a handful of cars that drive well. It's not entriely acracde, nor simulation. This game really dumbs down, well, everything. The acting, animations and premises are stiff, emotionless and basically only serve to illustrate why this game failed so miserablely on release. It's the age-old, tried to do so many things, that it can't do anything well. It's pretty, as long as you don't look to hard, and it's fun if you're not expecting much. There's a lot that is just frustrating. Somehow, I've managed to log a couple hundred hours on this game despite all it's faults. Probably for lack of a suitable alternative.The Good:Being able to roam to 'real' islands.Quite a few cars, some are even good to drive.Somewhat pretty, if dated.The Bad:Online play sucks, when it works, populated by tools.Console-audience focused development is obvious.Single-player racing, while passable, is pretty uninspired.Some of the vehicle dynamics, like the consideration of torque curve vs horsepower curve or lack of adjustability in cars that have it from the factory, much less would get it as soon as you started swapping parts.The Ugly:All the non driving-related fluff. Poor tuning and performance options.Overall lack of diversity in traffic, there will be the same density of cars on dead-ends as freeways, day or night, rain or shine.Nagging NPCs, GPS and feature commentary.Some notable marquees are absent, while you can't help notice others.

												There are a lot of positive and negative reviews of this game and they are both mostly spot on, I really like the game, but, this short review will tell you specifically why I don't recommend that you spend any money on the game, at all.I am a recent purchaser of the game, I picked it up late in 2014. I have a high number of hours in the game because, when it works, despite issues, it's fun. The problem is simple: the game is too dependent on Atari's servers and they are up and down constantly, lately, more down than up.  I would wait at least six months before buying this game to see if Atari demonstrates that they are commited to keeping the game running.			"

I have spent several days researching and trying to login to play online and all I get is account does not exist. I have done everything every forum I have visited has indicated to do and nothing works. I would have rather drug my balls over broken glass than bought this. Its not steams fault although things between them and Atari and/or Eden Games should have been rectified before rereleasing this game.			"

												Pros: Reasonably fun driving, Licensing system similar to a dumbed down version of Gran Turismo, Decent range of cars and garage holdings.Cons: Outdated, terrible storyline, limited freedriving interspersed with the ""game""I picked up this game looking for a PC option for games like Forza or Gran Turismo.  As a standalone, for the discount price, it's not awful, but it clearly is showing it's age at this point.  Driving wise, the physics are pretty unrealistic, but it offers a large landscape for open driving.  The biggest drawback is really the story, which as you'll read in any number of reviews, is quite awful.  It tries to be too much like Grand Theft Auto and ends up falling somewhere in between as a half sandbox, half racing game that really falls pretty flat in either category.			"

												After the tons of fun that was Test Drive Unlimited, I bought the sequel, expecting more of the same good stuff. Boy, was I wrong...After the free-roaming driving game with many fun cars (and some nice bikes), plenty of different races/missions to do and a near complete lack of nonsense that was the first TDU, we get a sequel that has almost nothing of that.I'm completely uninterested in the online component, as I would rather play single player than be run into by various morons, strangers and griefers (no offense to you strangers who happen to be nice), which is the same way I felt about TDU1 (which I played 99+% offline), so I won't be commenting on any differences in that aspect. A simple LAN mode, with or without the possibility of setting up a dedicated server, would have made it a better game to play with friends and people one can tolerate.Anyway, in comparison with TDU1, TDU2 has some of the following differences:+ Slightly nicer graphics+ More than one island to drive around on+ Some weather- No Lamborghini cars (probably not the devs' fault, but they were some of the most fun ones in TDU1)- Really bad physics and car handling- A lot of dead weight in the form of bad narrative, boring cutscenes and other ""cinematic"" nonsense- A very linear progression, with missions locked until you complete the previous bunch.- Mandatory driving schools (several ""tiers"" of them for each of the three car types, too) before you can access a huge amount of the content. Also, they are harder to get through than most of the game, for no good reason. I hate them.To sum it all up...If you liked the first Test Drive Unlimited, you should avoid this.If you just want a fun driving/racing game (other than just cruising around), you should avoid this.If you like player freedom, you should avoid this.If you want a game free of ""cinematic"" garbage and general fluff, you should avoid this.If, on the other hand, you like being forced through bad narrative, watching cutscenes, playing frustrating mandatory tutorials and being rail-roaded through a really linear waste of time? Well, feel free to knock yourself out and play this. I know I won't touch it anymore. I'm just gonna go back and play TDU1 and  Need for Speed 3. At least, those games did racing and driving fun.

												I could only say you need to google it up in multiple review sites to get all the pieces together. You'll see why it sucks so badly. I could go on but knowing myself I'd probably go on for 100 lines of disrecommending.I'll go on with a few annoying things that occured to me in the game.Marcus (Something) after you're on your way for a championship, after a license... :""Hey little guy, it's Marcus, Listen, I don't remember teaching you all these techniques so you can just quit. The track awaits!""Me: rrrrghhh... Really? REALLY!!? I'm, like, at 20 F-----' meters from the ENTRY ICON down the road!! DON'T FRIGGIN' CALL ME NOW! My GPS is already targeting what you want me to, for cryin' out loud!!Other occurences of the such happen when you're at 30 KM (18.7Miles) away and you don't have a choice but to slog your way there, and all the time they're gonna call you and cuss you out for not making it here in a minute or so.The multiplayer sucks just as much, and so does the free-roam and instant challenge... and don't think you'll have a good time on your non-single player mode intended bike, or you'll be disappointed. people will ram you off, doesn't matter if they're 12, 20 ,30 years old or whatever. They'll ram the hell out of you. Bike or not, which means they're gonna get in their SUVs and block your road. If you're in a low speed car, avoid setting online interactions to ""On"" since it's just not worth it.About the instant challenge part, it's not even instant. On offline mode, the game shoves a random road down your throat and it's up to you to beat a C4 Lancia Delta(Classic 4 car class, AKA slow clunkers since the amount of upgrades in this game, simply put, sucks. more on that below.) Lancia Delta with your A4 Camaro (Asphalt 4 class, which divides into 7 categories. A4 Is middle of the road speed, with abysmal handling cars often) because it'll get a massive speed boost and it'll ram you.Online instant challenges are purgatory in terms of annoyance, you'll be purposedly rammed by the opponent players and if you've got a small car versus an SUV, you can expect you'll be blocked to a point where you'll wonder why this game mode even exists offline AND online!You try to get past the traffic? Nope. Even the traffic cars are evil, they'll speed up to intercept you, sometimes they spin out to try to avoid you but they'll often spin out in YOUR direction. With extreme convoy events, you'll lose a ton of your pay and that's if you're even lucky enough for the clean-driving meter to not empty.But why keep going on when the prize cash is just *419$ (*Referencial number to mean ""Junk"") and that the retries're infinite?You made it to the finish area before retrying? Congratulations, you just lost all your means of retrying this events. But who cares!? You've got better to do! Like grinding 1.6 million credits'ish to get a bugatti after you've spent stuff on cosmetic surgery (which makes your character looks like a donkey, and can only be applied to his already --gly face.) and got all your furniture.Oh wait, I'll use this trick...

Speaking of which (again) Don't try to catch up to a Bugatti Veyron 16.4 (Super Sport or not) when you get an offer to be the cop, The previous car in question is a super-top tier A1 car while they give you a Dodge Viper SRT *'08 (*Estimated year from what I think) which is a higher-mid tier A2 car. You won't stand the slightest chance.Oh no, I didn't stop on a dirt crossroad, that's a road violation... just gonna go off road to lower the meter, OH NO! I accidentally rammed a cop, gotta run!! ............Why isn't my violation bar filled? Oh and I need to be on an actual road/trail to lower this damn meter? All right, all right... Cool, It's starting to lower. OH NO! It's almost full since I collided with a few road-side light cylinders which aren't even lit during night time!! Okay, I'm gonna park my car aside of the road and cool my nerves down. Hey, the meter's going down. (Traffic car arrives behind) what the... OH NO IT'S FULL!!! They're targetting me!!! I'll go and hide!! (Hides in a GPS-wide wheat field) whew. (Finally empties) What a pursuit!!Oh wait it wasn't.Asphalt club races are NOTHING but but Bugatti Veyron ram-to-win contests. Both clubs're gonna ram each others' cars to the finishing line. Either this or a Buggy V8 (Which is super ugly and hard to drive, especially in the rain.)May the dirtiest win a few points toward their endless grind for a level 3 club... either this or take away 50,000$ off the instant challenge's unfortunate loser.Now I mentioned sooner there are license tests before? WHY, just WHY would there be license tests when richa-- illegal race events are the main focus?Mastery points were so much better.This game gets a big 5 out of 5 F.U. rating from me. (A la Wreckless Eating)Don't buy it, It's not worth your time.I know this whole b----ing review is about an outdated game, but still I needed to let my anger out.I'mma go get an infusion, a Vachon cake and chill out taking a walk in the neighborhood.Jumpin' outta subject for a bit...........Best way for me to get a break from such a hidden hell in what Marcus (The A license guy/ Whatever again) calls the rich mens' heaven is to do something you'll know will be enjoyable, and look, my PS Vita gave me Distance points in Disgaea 3 AoD for bringing my console with me and playing it while I walk around.Now THAT's enjoyable.But then I feel the need to come back and keep trying on and on and on and... you get the point.

												I can't recommend this game for most people.That said, it's one of my favorite games to just cruise, (say, after some GTA, or a real driving sim) and there are a handful of cars that drive well. It's not entriely acracde, nor simulation. This game really dumbs down, well, everything. The acting, animations and premises are stiff, emotionless and basically only serve to illustrate why this game failed so miserablely on release. It's the age-old, tried to do so many things, that it can't do anything well. It's pretty, as long as you don't look to hard, and it's fun if you're not expecting much.

												This is the best racing game you can buy right now. Open world! Pretty great car selection for this game. Once you get past the funny people talking the driving part of the game is fantastic and I love this game so much. If you like car games and you havent played this one you are seriously missing out. The only reason they stop working on this game is because it really didnt get any hype, if it had we would be seeing Test drive 3 coming soon.Easy 9.75/10really wish it had good physics			"

												It is neither as technical as any Codemasters game, nor as friendly-driven and arcade like Burnout and last Need for Speed iterations. But it has somewhat that you may have very fun (maybe the european approach made the game seems like that).It is an open-world driving game. As a valet driver, you basically do a bulk of events (including driving permission tests) from where you earn cash and experience. You have to win all the regional events (each one ends as a challenge against one of your rivals) in order to match a final ""island grand cup"", both in Ibiza and Hawaii islands (starting on first one).The soundtrack and the scenario modeling are the superb things. It is a very nice environment, beautifully shaped. But the character modeling is pretty bad, although (both graphically and about dialogues).The gameplay is reasonable. With a ""PS2-like controller"", you will have all the controls you need. The game is responsive and controlling the car is relatively easy. Maybe game menus are a little tricky sometimes, but it is a thing easily to be used to.The game has a overall moderate challenging factor. The simulation factor is not high. You cannot make a turn reckessly with your car in some categories, but when you master that (it's a little hard), you beat all championships easily. Maybe the greatest difficulty of game is finding the right car for the right event. Besides each model and its features, you must find the brand's sellers through the HUGE scenarios. There are many of the great high-level car brands (some are missing, likely due lack of agreements with manufacturers). You must explore both islands to complete the tasks given to you, find shops, enter championships and even to find multiplayer spots.You can customize your character (clothes and plastic surgery), your car (tuning, painting and so on) and the houses/manors you can buy.By the way, multiplayer is gradually being abandoned, but you will find people doing some weird things (like races that the fastest lap was one second...).The DLC's are not recommended. A couple of cars (not available in-game and has nothing effectively different from what you can purchase on the scenarios' stores) and a Casino that you may earn some cash to buy things. Both are expensive.You may have some fun. It's not a mind-blow. The game has a soft and relaxing mood sometimes due it's soundtrack and the locations chosen. Maybe it was intentional.			"

												Here's what you need to do for this game not to suck.. (minor review for $4.99)THIS IS FOR OFFLINE ONLY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK1. Get a complete save game file, the terrible thing about this game is that a full copy does have all the dlc right in your installation but these jokers just made it so you can't use them. Butttt what you can do is put in a different save game to get access to most of these cars. I popped in a random save file and got most of the cars and some extra cash to spend. Don't rely on the story mode for entertainment for this game. Everything about it is terrible, like it's really bad. Just don't play it.YouTube™ Video: Test Drive Unlimited 2 - The best savegame with all cars (Casino, Club, DLC and wrecked) (PC) Views: 218,534PLEASE, READ! Status: Level 41 (Celebrity) All races completed More than 30 million to spend Several homes to buy Some cars to buy Bonus: a garage with all the Ferraris in Hawaii The following...2. The cockpit view location is terrible as well but there is a simple fix to that problem. There is a camera hack that lets you move the cockpit view to anywhere in the car or simply just a litttle bit farther back to where you are not breathing on the windshield of the car. For this steam version only v1.2 will work, don't get 1.3.http://forum.turboduck.net/threads/28833-StarGT-Hennessey-Venom-GT/page3?p=489925#post4899253. Get the community patch (retail) This should fix most of the problems that the original game developers were too lazy to fix. I like this game but at the same time I'm glad they got fired, this ♥♥♥♥ is gets pretty annoying.http://forum.turboduck.net/threads/30312-TDU2-Unofficial-Patch-v03bThat being said none of this garbage should be done for this game, then again it is a budget game at this point in time. Once you do those things this game IS fun to play. With those mods this is just a game to play on a chill night when you've got nothing better to do. Sit back, hook up a xbox controller, play some tunes and this is a good game. And yes, the people that made this game were all fired and there is no support and actually buying the dlc cars does not work. So I would have to say that this is public domain now for people to do what they want with it.			"

												Possibly the best racing game out there. The thing that makes this game so much better than the rest is the freedom you get. The world is massive, containing two islands; Ibiza and Hawaii, both with full asphalt and dirt roads, so if driving on paved roads gets a little boring, you can change it up a bit and go offroading. There are quite a few cars in the game, which means that there is a fair amount of variety when choosing your car(s). There are a few problems with the game. There is no option for a clutch without a racing wheel, so you can only go automatic or sequential. I highly recommend getting a gamepad because some of the cars will slide about with the arrow keys. Also when compared to Test Drive Unlimited (prequel), the police in this are suicidal. In TDU they simply try to surround you and bring you to the side of the road, whereas in this the objective is to ram you until you are stuck between a tree and 3 cops, and have to give up.Otherwise the game is brilliant. Definitely recommend buying it if you are into racing games.			"

One of the best things about the classic game was that you just picked a car and then drove it.Good luck trying to do that with this thing...Granted I know that some people may like the idea of a story to go along with their racing game, but it shouldn't take 1/2 an hour just to get into a game, get the controller configured, and just DRIVE.I bought this game back when it was full price and I regret ever spending the money.

												I play a lot of driving games across many platforms, and very few legitimately anger me like this one does. The physics are horrible, each group of cars feels the same. Whether it's the uncontrollable spinning nature of the Classics, the incredibly light and floaty steering of the Off-Roaders, or the go-anywhere-but-around-corners Exotics. And the challenges, oh man the challenges. You'll find yourself exclusively playing the car loan challenges only because A: The ygive you an incredibly unbalanced amount of cash, and B: because it keeps you away from the other challenges that will make you drive your mouse and keyboard (and gamepad if you own one) into the monitor as hard as you can. Like the challenge that requires you to drive a drunk woman home, where first gear alone will fill the meter by half, and the turns will take the rest.It wouldn't be so bad if the game had some variety, some sort of life to it, like it's predecessor did. But in this it just feels like they carbon copied the last game and then poorly redid the main functions of it. Hell, it has the island from the last game, but having two islands causes them both to feel empty, due to spreading out the game across the two, and lazy, due to the two islands not really having much to diffferentiate in terms of scenery and road design. (You would think that Hawaii and Ibiza would be a little bit more diffrent, if only to justify having both islands)In the end, the game will frustrate you and make you wish you'd just bought something else with your £15. I've played a lot of driving games, and this is honestly one of the very worst.Not as bad as Big Rigs, but that has it's own category...			"

												These two open world race titles have much together, but also much differences. And will The Crew be as good as Test Drive? Find it out in this review.________MAP_________In TDU 2 you have two maps: Hawaii and Ibiza. You unlock Hawaii after 10 levels. What I have to say about the maps in TDU 2 is: They are vacationish. More about that in the Graphics comparision, but let me say one thing: garish colors all over the map. In TDU you also have pretty much the same look everywhere. In The Crew you will be able to drive through several stuff like (real big) cities, deserts, mountains etc... So that is a point that The Crew wins.Both games have huge maps. In Test Drive the map is a bit smaller though and, as I said, splitted in two pieces, so The Crew wins in general.The Crew 1 : 0 TDU 2______STICKERSHOP_______The Sticker shop of TDU 2 is great. You can choose different stickers (like out of 150!) and turn and place them whereever you wish. Choose colors by yourself, this is just a great content of TDU. The only bad thing I know about it, and it is very bad, is that the car and older sticker become more and more fuzzy when you add more stickers.THe Sticker shop of The Crew is not completely finished, but you can test the pre-alpha at their website and I have to say: Wow, good job already, Ubisoft! It has pretty much the same functions as the TDU one, though not so many stickers yet, and some nice ""import"" functions.All in all these two games are most probably the games with the best stickershops until now.Draw!The Crew 1 : 0 TDU 2______TUNING______TDU 2 has to stand back in the Tuning category though. The only things you can do are: Level 1-3 Brakes, level 1-3 Speed, level 1-3 acceleration and some different wheels. In The Crew you can tune everything, every little bit of your car. Look at these preorder boni: http://thecrew-game.ubi.com/portal/de-DE/order/index.aspxThere are tunings avaiable for interior, tencers, skirts, motor hood, rear wings and even side mirrors. Not to speak of the whole in-car techniques. Motor, Tires, Suspers, weight, chasis etc etc. And the car looks completly different depending on in which mode you drive it. This is a completly clear win for The Crew!The Crew 2 : 0 TDU 2____MULTIPLAYER_____Both of these games are multiplayer games. In both you mainly drive online, but also have the opportunity to drive offline. But in The Crew it works out better. As the name of the game already says: ""The Crew"". You drive in a crew, hopefully out of friends, otherwise out of AIs. But the options to play with your friends (that I could test out at Gamescom already) are just much better in The Crew. Though both games do not have any loading screens it is slightly easier to handle the menues for online play in The Crew.Moreover the servers of The Crew will most likely be online longer. Take a look at other Ubisoft games: still a good connection. Take a look at Test Drive: Servers already offline! And the best thing about that: the game still tries to connect with Atari, so many people can not play their game anymore at all. Because of that bug I would even like to give a minus point to TDU (guess whose copy does not run anymore), but I do not know how many people actually have that issue, so I am just going to call it a Draw again.The Crew 2 : 0 TDU 2______CONTROLS_______In both games you can use your keyboard, a Controller or a Racing wheel. And I have to praise TDU, because you can even use an H-Shifter as controller, but Ubisoft did not give me any information than the ones I found out myself, so I think I am going to call it a Draw again.The Crew 2 : 0 TDU 2______GRAPHICS______Okay, compare a 2011 old-gen game to a 2014 next-gen game. Of course the 2014 one looks better. But what I personally like about Test Drive is: Everything creates a feeling of vacation, bright colors, many many trees and palms, beautiful sun settings. The Crew looked more like Driver San Fransisco looks. Serious and hard. And in my opinion the graphics of Test Drive is still perfectly alright (ok, I			"

												I've not even played half an hour of this game but I'm afraid I can already tell you that I can't recommend it. That's not me being spiteful or anything either, because I loved TDU1 on PSP and PS2.It's mostly technical issues. Thankfully, the game does support controllers, although not automatically; you have to enable this from the settings.The first thing you'll notice upon booting up the game is that it only runs in windowed mode. F11 and the maximise button did not fix this, and although there was an option to change the resolution in the settings, there was no fullscreen option. I'm not sure if it's me being mad, but full games running in windowed mode tend to result in choppier framerates, and that was certainly the case here.Then we have the car handling itself. The tiniest of braking will send you spinning out of control for no reason whatsoever. It makes the game unplayable. It was the same in both the high-end Ferrari care the game teases you with in the beginning (which was really just slow and spinny), and with the starter car you buy.Furthermore, when in first person mode the mouse sensitivity is extremely slow, even when set to the highest possibility in the settings.I would advise against buying.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEI bought this in th autumn sale and the game is just terrible, the story is probably alright but there is too many issues in the game which make it unplayable. First, you cannot go into full screen, there is a fix for this in that you have to press alt-f every time you launch the game. Why can't there just be an option in the menus to go fullscreen? My second issue was framerate. My pc is very capable of running a game like this in the highest graphics possible with 60fps. However this game gives me lower than 20 fps no matter what graphics settings I play at, I've looked on the internet for fixes (there were a lot more people with the same problem) and none of them worked. My drivers are up to date and there is no possible cause for this problem, I don't know if it is to do with Nvidia but just don't buy this game.			"

												This game is terrible. I did not go through enough of the reviews before I bought this one. When I originally read about it, people were saying that the customization was great even though it's not strictly a simulation driver/racer... I should have gone through all the reviews, because this game is one of the worst, and I paid $8 for it. Such a dupe... there are so many other games that are entertaining on steam for less money. The short list here, no this is not a simulation... its very far from it... you get better driving in Just Cause 2. You can not escape the dialogue, which is so ridiculous.. Even if this game were free, I would have deleted it after 5 minutes of play. This game would have been entertaining back in the mid 90s... however as a release for 2011... 3 fuggin years ago... this is a public abortion of epic proportion... I tried Test Drive games before, like 15 years ago, and was disappointed, I don't know who slipped me a mickey to convince me that this might be worth anything...			"

												Great game but I would not recommend it to anyone. You can only play offline and without DLC because the required servers are mostly offline. And when they come online they aren't for longer period of time. The game itself is quite nice but obsolete and there are much better alternatives. Although I played it for awhile I still consider it a waist of money. It should be removed from the store of sold with all the DLC contents available and working in offline mode.			"

												Steam should be persecuted for ripping people off. They create a user rated tags on whether or not a game is multiplayer as to free themselves from any wrongdoing when marketing the game. They get us to rate it as multiplayer when it is at release, then they leave the tag up when the game quickly goes offline and reduce the price to entice people to buy before word gets out that the servers are down. It should be petitioned against.			"

												The least amount of fun you can have for $50.Lame gameplay with endless ramblings about clubs and lifestyles. Uninspiring driving, worse than TDU1.Update:Ok, so now that I have played the game a bit there is not much else to say, the good parts of TDU1 (driving feel etc) are worse and the bad parts (clubs, lifestyle, yada yada) are in the foreground.To even suggest that this game has any meaningful racing wheel support is beyond me (I have a G27). The clutch is implemented as a binary switch which just makes it utterly useless. It is hard (want to say impossible but that would be a bit harsh) to configure a wheel as all the settings are either inverted or just meaningless. It is impossible to get the wheel in the car to match the motion of the controller, perhaps this causes the loose feeling in steering, or perhaps it is just the non existant FFB. The UI is bad (console port), the sounds are mediocre and sometimes bugged (windows open and, voila: no change, AI cars sometimes have little/no sound). The cutscenes can be skipped, but the in-game dialogue still has enough ""charisma"" to make you want to punch the monitor.  The biggest mystery of the MOOR-genre is why Atari nuked FFB support for TDU1 and shut down the servers in favor of this abortion.			"

												The game runs beautifully, but it crashes like crazym every 30 minutes or so. In 2 hours of playing it it crashed 3 times. The last time it crashed (which is a few minutes ago) the controller got stuck on rumble, though the game closed. It still vibrates in my lap. No, I'm not a girl. And I ain't gay, either :|EDIT: a bit of a personal, subjective thing, but here it is: the game lacks any Lamborghini. Disheartening, to say the least, because it is my car of choice in any racing game and it is, basically, why I play racing games. Once I get these cars, I don't care about going further in the game, I just drive them around and that's it, I don't need anything else.The game still crashes quite often.And the most annoying thing: many best cars are locked behind a pay wall. You get to them, inspect them, but you can't get them unless you buy them from Atari.			"

												I only bought this game as it was on sale and Test Drive Unlimited is not available anywhere. Well, this game is far from the original one. For some reason the creators thought the right way to improve a racing title is to put more clothes, hair styles and a dumb story line in it.Apart from technical issues with TDU servers the ""story"" mode with all the bulls**t renders the game unenjoyable. It takes loooong minutes until you can finally get in a car and drive - in a game called ""Test Drive"". Seriously: DO NOT BUY.			"

												+++ Expansive environments with plenty of variety.+++ Large selection of cars.--- Spotty and unpredictable driving physics.--- Inferior graphical optimization.--- Awful voice acting.--- Disengaging story.--- Is the game server down?  Then you are out of luck.There is something to be said of a game that remains wholly incompatible with a recent computer for a full year and a half before it agrees to work with the latest video card drivers.  This is only the first of several problems.TDU2 seems to have somewhat lost itself into attempting to be an experience of playing a rich man and his toys, with racing itself taking the backseat.  It's one that does not pass very well in concept let alone in practice: the result is a player character who by a strange stroke of luck gets pulled into a would-be reality TV show featuring spoiled rich brats with a short temper, and it appears the plot's hook is to antagonize the player as much as possible.  Much work appears to have been done into rendering the interior of homes and shops, features that are ultimately inconsequential and appear superfluous in the grand scheme.On the road, things are hit and miss.  Some cars hold on to the asphalt well enough while others - much like it's been in TDU1 - slip and slide to such a degree as to make them undriveable.  Jumps are handled in a wholly unpredictable way, with several of them resulting in the car coming to a sudden stop or flipping over.  The racer AI is basic at best and wholly uncompetitive at worst - though curiously, time attack stages are noticeably difficult.The game will go down as a poorly ported bargain bin racer that might attract the eyes while on sale, but fact remains that for a few dollars more, it is possible to grab a much more polished racing game.

												Years ago I enjoyed this game on the PS3 and my older PC, and so I was thrilled to see it coming to Steam. Alas, I was utterly disappointed by the constant freezes, and the inability to max out graphics settings. Furthermore, support is non existend, the developer, Eden games has closed, and it is impossible to buy virtual tokens and access certain DLC content, mainly the casino. As much exciting was my prior experience with this great game, the Steam edition is very frustrating and unrewarding. Stay away from this mess.			"

It's not quite as good as in the Forza games.Very good car selection, ranging from an Alfa MiTo to Bugatti Veyron to Koenigsegg CCXRCons:The way the cars handle makes me thing they weren't finished yet when they released the game.You need to buy motorbikes with real money.The story isn't that good.It gets very repetitive very quickly.The license system in the game doesn't make any sense.Too much DRMSteering wheel support is rubbish. It has it but you have to spend hours setting it up properly.If you can get it working and you have some friends who have this, it can be very fun online. If you don't have friends who own this game, it's not worth buying unless it's 80% off or something.			"

												Cruising around with your friends or on your own is about as much fun as you will get out of this game. This game is a deep disappointment in comparison to the first game. The game really feels arcadish and boring. The driving is simply horrible even for an arcade game and the physics engine is horrificly terrible. The first game was actually really great, but this is just a plain and simple diaster. Online play seems completley broken and rarely works in my expirience yet when you do get online it can be fun for a short while.This has to be one of the worst racing games I have ever played and I reccomend staying away from this.

												I really wanted to put a lot of time into this game but for 3 reasons I'll probably never play it again.1. God Damn Awful Physics: The physics in this game are just horrible. Every time I make a turn I spin out of control.2. Ridiculous Driving Tests: The driving tests in this game are so crappy. There isn't even a need for them.3. Bad Story and voice acting: There is almost never a story in a racing game, but when there is one it should be good. In this game they should have just removed the whole story and just made it a simple racing game. But they didn't and now it just makes the game worse. With a terrible story, terrible lines, and bad voice acting it just butchers the entire game.Overall this is one of the worst games I've ever played.			"

												I really wanted to put a lot of time into this game but for 3 reasons I'll probably never play it again.1. God Damn Awful Physics: The physics in this game are just horrible. Every time I make a turn I spin out of control.2. Ridiculous Driving Tests: The driving tests in this game are so crappy. There isn't even a need for them.3. Bad Story and voice acting: There is almost never a story in a racing game, but when there is one it should be good. In this game they should have just removed the whole story and just made it a simple racing game. But they didn't and now it just makes the game worse. With a terrible story, terrible lines, and bad voice acting it just butchers the entire game.Overall this is one of the worst games I've ever played.			"

												Before I start I just want to point out a few things, I have written two reviews, one for the faint-hearted and one for those who really care. Also I have played TDU 1 and 2 and I can say for sure that TDU 1 is much better.Short summary:It's a horrible game with many bugs and glitches. The gameplay is boring and it's impossible to win a race in the later stages and before I forget THE SAVEFILE RANDOMLY GETS CORRUPT AFTER YOU PLAY FOR 40 HOURS. So the conclusion of this review, do NOT buy this game if you don't want to waste your life on a ♥♥♥♥ arcade racing game. Pros: should I even botherCons: the whole gameDetailed review:This game is badly optimized and in some places unplayable. Tabbing out is an exampel of how ♥♥♥♥ this game is, and it is like the developers didn't want you to play it at all sometimes when the game doesn't start. The story is the worst I have ever seen, the driving licenses are very difficult  to get and the championships are unrealistic, also the driving can't be more arcade, it feels like you are driving a boat. Multiplayer is the only fun part about this game, that is when it works of course, the game has a tedious server feature wich makes you join your friend, most of the time this does not work. The only other good thing I think is the selection of cars, there are many different cars and car dealers, with three types of different cars, asphalt, classic and off-road. I personally think off-road is the best and has the most realistic feel. Pros: - Multiplayer - Car selectionCons: - Badly optimized- Unrealistic driving- ♥♥♥♥ story			"

Game ran okay the first time I played, until I went to play the next day only to find the game lagging and stuttering regardless of what settings I used.Gamepleay wise its pretty mediocre for a racing game.

												The first Test Drive Unlimited was better. You simply buy the game once and play. UNLOCK all of the cars, not pay real money. And the controls for the cars are unbearable. I may not be a racer, but I'm pretty sure cars are supposed to turn, not slide all over the place. The best way to describe it is putting a stick of butter on a frozen pond and kicking it, That is the traction for these cars. If you're going to buy, buy it on sale.			"

The driving schools just get more frustrating and annoying, really, really, aggravating and until you finish them, they block the rest of the game, no wander they shut down the studio, their idea of fun is creating a dickish game.Some cars a broke, like driving on ice, a car even has the gears swicthed around, save yourself the frustration and go elsewhere for a game TDU unlimited is fun TDU is just too annoying to bother with.

												A realistic driving game with insane graphics and nice cars, too! I especially like the gameplay and storyline, with the parts where you just walk around like it's The Sims included. They finally gave an explanation for why you would get money for passing by other cars closely, or jumping in the air with your car, and it's a pretty reasonable one too, so that's cool! I was affraid this would be some cheap console port, and even though the accept button is green, the cancel button is red, and there is also a blue and a yellow button, I really like the gameplay and the controls are fully customizable. I ordered a Microsoft Wireless Receiver for XBOX360 controller to try with this game, because I miss the analog steering, but besides that, it's an awesome game!			"

I download the title and attempt to open it. It says the title is running but it isn't on my taskbar or anything. After forcefully shutting down my computer to close the game, I attempted to play the game again. Same problem. Launching it was also an issue. I have a pending refund and will no longer own the title in the coming days. If you really want this game, make sure you don't get it on PC because it DOES NOT WORK!Edit:Since this review, Steam has refunded the game, yet it still does not launch properly.			"

												I really cannot recommend this game. Yes you are getting a lot for your money, Two huge Islands with hundreds of Kilometres of Road, many different cars and bikes, a lot of different clothing, many houses which you can ecplore freely, Day and Night cycle, Weather effects which actually affect the Handling. However that is the problem. The Handling. The cars just feel very very sloppy. Some of them are simply uncontrollable. And no matter how many features a Racing game has, the most essential thing is the feeling of the cars. There is no sense of speed in this game. 250 kph feel exactly the same as 150 kph. The Engine sounds are basically all the same, just pitched higher or lower. The cars don't sound like cars, more like a kid saying VRROOOOOM VVVVRRRROOOOM. Another problem is the ""Story"". Each and every Character in this game is annoying as hell. They are all arrogant and rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who basically do nothing else than show of how much money they have. It's just completely unnecessary. Also the cops are... well.. they are there, but they don't do anything. Pass them by with 300+ kph, they won't give a ♥♥♥♥. Ram into civilian cars right next to them, they won't care. Even if you ram straight into them nothing is going to happen. A Search Level Bar fills, but they won't come after you until it is full, which is next to impossible to achieve. And even if you do get them to come after you, you will lose them very quickly, as they are just really really stupid and slow. I advise you to keep away from this Game and invest your Money elsewhere.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this was the BEST racing game EVER. Not doubt about that.The reason that I downvote is plain and simple: support for this game has been dropped ages ago. The servers rarely work, you're lucky to get in the game. The game has all kinds of issues to launch with the launcher. There are workarounds but nah. This is the problem of games with launchers/always online. Once the support is dropped, your game is dead.			"

												Likes : Game play ability to freely roam around anywhere.Car wreck hunts, Dislikes : Police chases funny how just a traffic violation causes you to be chased by 3 - 6 cars and a helio as if you just robbed a bank and killed a few people they should of did some research on this.Car selection very limited you don't have a whole lot of choices on cars.They should of been more clear about their definition of ""unlimited""I wouldn't suggest this game to any of my friends etcAtari is the worse company out there they refuse too take care of their customers when things go wrong.They won't refund you for anything that gets messed up and or lost during patching or some error.And instead they suggest you to repurchase tokens *And it is not legal too sell any in game content what so ever when there isn't any kind of support system in the game*Atari is well known to screw things and all up.Good job by the way atari on selling out Cryptic on a very short notice to perfect world who also has a bad reputation.If you are going to shut down atari i believe now is a good time for it since you are just taking in cash and screwing customers over			"

												The driving model of this game is somewhere between Arcade, Realism and WTF??  But that does not hinder me from playing it. The Open World, Apartments and tons of customizations invite you to waste some time in this game. What I don't like, however, is that you are forced to drive on every road to raise your exploration level in order to be able to Tune. It also does not have any cloud support nor is your character stored on a server which makes it a major pain to loose your save in that game. It is also a pita to play together with friends, because only 6 people at once are allowed in one instance of the islands Ibiza and Hawaii. But still, it is a good game with some minor flaws and if you can look beyond that, it is fun. "

												I want to like this game. I really do! But it isn't even fun. My main problems are that you have to download an extra 1 GB of the game via launcher. If you want to get a refund (which I tried to), you can't let it sit there. You MUST keep coming back to it, so don't leave it on to download over night or something, that'll make Steam give you the middle finger when you try to get a refund. I have 8 hours put into the game mainly because of the damn extra GB they make you install. Also, the graphics are horribly outdated, even when it launched. With maximum settings, the game still looks like absolute ♥♥♥♥. The framerate stays around 30 FPS, even on the lowest setting. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT GET THIS GAME! It'll waste your time. The map is pretty nice though, just a little bland. The voice acting sucks ♥♥♥, along with the story.			"

												I am writing this out because I am so unhappy with this waste of my money... I read the reviews but I saw enough good ones to have enough hope in a good game. But I was wrong. This game is absolutely impossible to drive in, and the story is just a mess. I was hoping for and improvement on TDU1, which was already pretty good, but it really was a letdown! It took me hours to set my controls to be acceptable with a Logitech F710 Wireless Gamepad (which is an xBox 360 Gamepad mimic) . And that was just barely acceptable. That struggle was soon forgotten when I had to deal with the HORRID handling. Now, I've played enough racing games, and done enough driving IRL to know that this isn't how it should work. I haven't even gotten past the beginning ""racing school"" that unlocks the rest of the game. I gave up after MANY tries . Not to mention the terrible framerate, also contributing to the horrible driving characteristics. Overall, this game is a complete letdown and a total waste of money. I really do hate to say it because it had so much potential to be amazing.			"

												This game is amazing, despite what others say. I originally played TDU2 on the PS3 and I loved the game, so I came back to it on PC. I don't know why people are saying the servers don't work, because they work for me. I also don't get why people are saying it won't open up all you have to do is wait for it to connect to your Wi-Fi and press ""Start"". Pros - The game has got an amazing open world which is full of houses, car dealerships and much more to explore. There are two main islands, Ibiza and Hawaii. The story is exciting as you earn more money through out the game, so you can buy houses and new cars. TDU2 is perfect for going on roadtrips around the islands! It's just a beutiful game which I've had so many memories playing on PS3 and that will continue on PC. Cons - Once on the PS3 the game deleted my data, I'm not sure if this happens on PC, but just be aware. I would also wait for this game to go on sale because it is a bit pricey for a game that is 6 years old. The controlls on a keyboard and mouse is like playing a game of twister, so I'd recomend buying a gamepad (preferably a Logitech F710 Wireless Gamepad). The handling is quite annoying on TDU2 because every time you brake (even gently) while turning, you spin out or lose controll, this is more prominent with more powerful cars. The devs have abandoned on this game because Eden Games have shutdown due to their workers going on strike. TDU3 has been officially announced by another company called BigBen Interactive who have made the newer WRC games. I just hope they put a bit more work into TDU3 than Eden Games did with TDU2, then it would be a more polished game.But I do recommend this game. "

												I like this game.Feels really realistic and it's fun to drive in an open-world with other people on the internet.You earn your own money and buy cars/flats/buildings with it. Of course the other players can see what you have. You can even change your clothes, you can walk around inside dealers, paint/tune your car and whatnot.Sometimes I had to force myself to take a break, it can be somewhat addictive :DThe most impressive experience gives you a steering wheel (+manual shifting and clutch). I'm also using three monitors which gives the edge.A new DLC will soon be released, too.Graphics wise it's pretty good but not exellent. The sounds, especially the engine sounds are one of the bigger disappointments. The music is cool but there is a serious lack of songs in the radio.I haven't even done many races yet, lol. There's different ways to earn money and discovering the world is also coolIf you like driving/racing/cruising and what I explained above, this game is for you			"

												At first you're going to hate this game, the heavy focus on social life like sims 3, the horrible handling and the slow paced story really got on my nerve. But that's always calmed down behind the wheel. The game is beautiful, with astonishing graphics, crazy environments and just great sounds, until you get interrupted by the GPS or a story person. But you can overlook that, because entering races is so easy and an enjoyable time to pass by. Only get it if you liked the first game, or you just like collecting cars.			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 – This is one of my favourite games. After spending over 1000 hours playing this on Xbox and then getting it on PC it is still a great game. There are a wide variety of cars you can get but unlike the first Test Drive Unlimited it doesn't have Lamborghini’s which where a very popular car for people. The sticker shop is awesome, with some of the designs that come out of there on people's cars it is just unreal, in fact I have a friend who is an artist and has made cars within the game which are beyond belief. The 2 maps are huge and I like the fact that they kept the first Test Drive map in and added a new one so there is Ibiza and Hawaii and to drive on everyone road would take you forever because of the size of the maps, you could play for 24 hours straight and still not cover every road. You meet a lot of nice people, in my opinion the community isn't half bad but there is a lot of Russian people and German people etc. There are a few problems with the game which are that it is a little glitchy, I don't think this game gets updated because there is nothing ever new or that has changed. Also the DLC can't be bought through Steam which makes it harder for some of us to get because you have to buy it through Atari's website. A major downside is that the contract agreed is that the TDU2 servers have to stay up for the next 3 years (to around 2017 as far as I know) and a lot of people are in agreement that they will be down near enough straight away after the contract is up.I highly recommend this game because there isn't many free-roam driving games that I know of, they are mostly all racing. If you can get a friend to get this aswell as you then you will probably enjoy it a lot more. If you wait to get it in the sales then it will be really worth it but either way you should get it.

Drift you're friends to the bottom, Race the kings in the community center!.

												Enjoyable racing game. Features the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii, which means plenty of roads to race on! Or instead of racing the races you could of course just do some relaxing sightseeing, test drive the cars you can't afford (yet), replace the furniture in your house or get cosmetically adjusted. Yes, this game also has some Sims-like aspects lol, but fortunately these are, as far I can tell with only 9 hours in, only aesthetic. Oh and you play online 'by default', making the game kind of MMO. This makes it easy to play races vs other players, since (in non-race mode) they are always driving around in the same world anyway.			"

												mixed feelings with this game. if your into just cruising around with friends you will like this game, but if you want a good story line this isnt for you as the story is just awful seems very rushed. the game as alot of bugs mainly for the multiplayer challenges are always crashing alot, you get invisble cars just appear in front of you (not often though) and might just be for me but it keeps crashing to my desktop randomly and i cant close the program without restarting my computer. when the game is working i do like it though like i said for crusing factor its brilliant its proberly the best part of the game and i do like finding the hidden stuff also. so it aint perfect but i would recommend it if its on a offer :) and if you have a steering wheel makes it alot better :)			"

												Enjoyable racing game. Features the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii, which means plenty of roads to race on! Or instead of racing the races you could of course just do some relaxing sightseeing, test drive the cars you can't afford (yet), replace the furniture in your house or get cosmetically adjusted. Yes, this game also has some Sims-like aspects lol, but fortunately these are, as far I can tell with only 9 hours in, only aesthetic. Oh and you play online 'by default', making the game kind of MMO. This makes it easy to play races vs other players, since (in non-race mode) they are always driving around in the same world anyway.			"

												TDU-2Well where to start with this game,I used to own TDU-1 on the X-Box-360, and really liked the idea and concept that was behind the game.Right CONS first.CONS1st. You HAVE to create an account with Atari ""No Biggie Really""2nd. You also have to start with the keyboard at the begining.""By the time i had to go to my garage to see my present i was buried in the menus straight away by hitting the escape key."" finally got to the controler part. although once i had accepted the change of layout things did seem to get better.3rd. To be honest and fair to the game i didnt even make it to my Garage ""YET""4th. Monitor resolution, Most games give you the option to change it with the little window that opens to launch the game. I had to go in the menu's to find the correct settings5th. Having to download an additional 1.6/7GB's of data at the launch of the game. ""Was Pretty Quick Though""PROS1st. The game does seem to look really good. ""Cant comment on the cars YET as not been playing long enough""2nd. The sheer amount of cars. ""Some of the top manufacturers""3rd. The fun side, you can have some really good crazy times playing this game with friends.That is all i have got for now but i will update it as i play through the game and progress, just to give a fair review, I have not even drove a car yet on this game, but being in the sale i would honestly say that yes i would reccomend this game to a friend and that i will more than likely enjoy playing this game, ""ONCE YOU GET YOUR HEAD AROUND THE MENU'S & SETTINGS & PUTTING THEM RIGHT"" that is.Cheersmark117hEdit : 22/12/2013 @ 20:38 Hrs.###UPDATE###Now that i have finally had a chance to be able to have an hour on this game, i can give an honest and proper review of it of sorts.I am currently using a controller that is like the x-box - 360's only its from madcatz i think and its got turbo mode, i was actually quite surprised at how ok the handling was using this as believe me i cant use a keyboard to play games to save my life and to be honest with you i HATE controllers normally in a racing/driving type of game.  I have the microsoft 360 wireless racing wheel and i love using it in my driving games especially driving with no aids on.My point is that the game is not bad at all in the handling with the controller, although it does show in Big Picture mode that the controller is not supported, well it is as i have been using one.Another thing is the cars WOW they look really polished and quite realistic and full of details, you can tell that Atari have put a lot of love into it.The island seems to be a real large area full of backwoods and motorways as well as some nice city scapes as well.So far i have not tryed the online multiplayer side of it, for fear of looking a T#*t, not being that good with a controller that is.Overall i would still say i would reccomend this game to friends and family alike, and yes i would rate it a decent game, as long as the price is a decent one, i got it in the sale so i cant really moan about that, but all in all i am happy with this purchase.Cheersmark117h			"

												I do not recommend  this as a racing game, i recommend this as a car game. By that i mean the driving isn't 100% and the force feed back (if you are using a wheel) is weak. However you can earn money buy loads of houses and hundreds of cars. If you look hard enough you can find a club with a maxium of 30 players. For me this is the ideal game. You get to live in this huge world and cruise hundreds of miles with freinds. You can buy funiture for your houses, cloths for you character. Unlike tdu1 you can actaully walk around buildings. You can buy dlc cars and a dlc called casino which alows you to play casino games with other players and gives you a chance to win rare items. Two cars also come with this dlc, Audi r8 spyder and a Spyker spyder. You can buy them or win them.I'm more than happy with my purchase that i made over a year ago. I joined a club met lots of freinds and bough lots and lots and lots of cars ;)Hope you enjoy the game. "

You can race, win challenges, buy houses, cars, clothes, haircuts, etc. And if you just want to lay back and drive, pick your favorite car and enjoy the beautiful scenic roads of Ibiza while day turns to night, encountering rain and cloudy skies. Online mode also gives the opportunite for unlimited races and challenges. This is one game you can really fall in love with and literally enjoy for months if not years!			"

												I like this game.Feels really realistic and it's fun to drive in an open-world with other people on the internet.You earn your own money and buy cars/flats/buildings with it. Of course the other players can see what you have. You can even change your clothes, you can walk around inside dealers, paint/tune your car and whatnot.Sometimes I had to force myself to take a break, it can be somewhat addictive :DThe most impressive experience gives you a steering wheel (+manual shifting and clutch). I'm also using three monitors which gives the edge.A new DLC will soon be released, too.Graphics wise it's pretty good but not exellent. The sounds, especially the engine sounds are one of the bigger disappointments. The music is cool but there is a serious lack of songs in the radio.I haven't even done many races yet, lol. There's different ways to earn money and discovering the world is also coolIf you like driving/racing/cruising and what I explained above, this game is for you			"

												A simulator that is actually fun.As long as you care less about story and voice acting, this game is like that one computer next to the paint isle at Lowes or Home Depot and crap. You go to your ""house"" and you can change the wall color and chairs and other misc. furnishing. Nuff said about the primary features, this marvelous work of code has a built in driving mini game where you work your way to the top with the big boys of racing. Atari really knocked it out of the park, and totally dissed eden for trying to ruin it, thankfully due to fan rage the opeining sequence was kept in the game, but was reduced to 2 fps for space concerns. The in game music is totally hype, and I personally recomend you keep it off due to the overwhelming ammount of new age/ generation of pop culture itself, let alone talent. You can tell this game was directed towards enviromentalists, after all, if you run at 256 miles per hour into a leaf from any plant the car will spontainously stop without harm to any living thing, allowing you to reflect on your terrible driving as your arch rivals pass, leaving you in dead last your greivous actions towards nature and virtual self. Your level can depend on several factors based on whatever the heck you feel fit. You can go through the game like a normal person and work on competition, which is basically just winning races and crap. If that does not appeal to you, you can also discover things on the 2 islands the game lets you play on. Since Test Drive Unlimited 2 is real life, if you want to take a backroad across Hawaii, it takes a real life 2 hours to do so, making discovery the slowest progressing level. There is also collection, which expalins itself, rewarding you for hoarding as much luxury items as possible. Finally there is Social, which even after reading a wikipedia article, I cannot comprehend the meaning of the word. Screw it, Social is the hardest to progress, since I am still at level 0 :/Final VerdictIs it the most interesting game out there? nopeIs it the most interesting RACING game out there? nopeIs it fun at all? Yeah, it has its moments, expecailly with the car customization.Its pretty good. You should get it, especially only if you have a steering wheel.			"

												Game seems to work only the first time you install it. After that the problems begin. The game simply ""hangs"" as a process after the launcher checks the files and you press Play. I managed to play only the first day I installed it and that was it. All the other times it's been trial and error with no luck. It's clearly a Steam issue as the game runs normally if you download a torrent, install the game and use the Steam CD key to make it legit. So until Steam does something about this, my review stands as a ""no"". 0/10.EDIT 1: Today the game decided to start, so I created an offline account to play. However the overlay menu was blank, no achievements, no game time being registered, no nothing. Of course after I shut down the game and try to rerun it, it didn't start. So -1/10.EDIT 2: I was starting to think my Windows 7 OS was failing the game. I did a clean install of Windows 10 x64 PRO and again the same stupid thing happens when starting the Steam version. So -2/10. PS: The game is awesome and if you really want to buy it, buy it. But to play do what I did: Download the game from a torrent and use the CD key you get from Steam to make it legit. Non Steam version works perfectly, no issues.			"

												I was loving this game until i got to the Asphalt Racing School in hawaii. I consider myself to be a good driver at racing games but the car they give you to do this is SO F***G BAD that the only way for you to make a corner without losing the control of it is to let the throtle down and just wait that the car decides to the cornor by its own. I got so ♥♥♥♥ing mad at this F****G stage of the game that i just F****G broke my External screen. Im being completly honest, this sh*t just happened because, yes, i have anger probles, and you can totally see that developers didn't give a flying sh*t at the game at this f***g point. I do recommend this game, I had and Have tons of fun with it, but Seriously, bring a punching bag to this stage if you have mental issues like me, I dont care who you are, i challenge you to do this stage without getting so mad that you would just Hit the developers so hard in the face that they would never wake up to do another f***g game again. Thanks for your Time. Again I never did a review because I am not that type of guy, but i felt that everyone needs to know about the lazy development, I didn't beat the whole game yet, so I don't really know what more to expect.

												I do not recommend  this as a racing game, i recommend this as a car game. By that i mean the driving isn't 100% and the force feed back (if you are using a wheel) is weak. However you can earn money buy loads of houses and hundreds of cars. If you look hard enough you can find a club with a maxium of 30 players. For me this is the ideal game. You get to live in this huge world and cruise hundreds of miles with freinds. You can buy funiture for your houses, cloths for you character. Unlike tdu1 you can actaully walk around buildings. You can buy dlc cars and a dlc called casino which alows you to play casino games with other players and gives you a chance to win rare items. Two cars also come with this dlc, Audi r8 spyder and a Spyker spyder. You can buy them or win them.I'm more than happy with my purchase that i made over a year ago. I joined a club met lots of freinds and bough lots and lots and lots of cars ;)Hope you enjoy the game. "

												mixed feelings with this game. if your into just cruising around with friends you will like this game, but if you want a good story line this isnt for you as the story is just awful seems very rushed. the game as alot of bugs mainly for the multiplayer challenges are always crashing alot, you get invisble cars just appear in front of you (not often though) and might just be for me but it keeps crashing to my desktop randomly and i cant close the program without restarting my computer. when the game is working i do like it though like i said for crusing factor its brilliant its proberly the best part of the game and i do like finding the hidden stuff also. so it aint perfect but i would recommend it if its on a offer :) and if you have a steering wheel makes it alot better :)			"

												Enjoyable racing game. Features the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii, which means plenty of roads to race on! Or instead of racing the races you could of course just do some relaxing sightseeing, test drive the cars you can't afford (yet), replace the furniture in your house or get cosmetically adjusted. Yes, this game also has some Sims-like aspects lol, but fortunately these are, as far I can tell with only 9 hours in, only aesthetic. Oh and you play online 'by default', making the game kind of MMO. This makes it easy to play races vs other players, since (in non-race mode) they are always driving around in the same world anyway.			"

You can drive with other people or they can mount in your car to drive together. Visit your friends home or invite them to your home. Its like having Facebook but in a driving game. A lot of cars to drive and many cars to discover! But try to evade bad drivers in free roam. They will have no doubt to crash your beautifull car if they jealous to.			"

												### Updated to reflect some changes ###This game is not just about racing. It is the ultimate rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator. You roll around Ibiza and Hawaii in your supercar and mingle with similar rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s - buying expensive clothes, accoutrements, real estate and gambling. You can practcally see the flashing of dollar bills and the glinting of the bleached teeth.The only thing that's missing is the ability to DUI. And that you can fix by roleplaying. Maybe really delve deep into the role and have a few pints or do some rails while playing. Who am I to judge?It's worth mentioning that some 30 minutes into the game a woman named after a Southern US city insulted my taste in fashion. And this happened in a game supposedly about racing cars.### UPDATE: The online features are gone, and most of the DLC content is no longer available (some vehicles and the DLC missions still remain - bikes are all gone though). Still, there's a good chunk of single player content in this. This is still a game that allows you to cruise around on not one, but two sizeable tropical islands in a decent selection of vehicles, ranging from a Golf GTI to a Koeningsegg CCRX with some legendary classics like the Lancia Delta Integrale or the Jaguar E-Type thrown in as well. All of them nicely modeled with fully detailed interiors, which is not a given even in standard titles like Gran Turismo.And folks have even managed to mod new cars into the game (though sadly only through replacing vanilla ones, as far as I know), so for instance if you prefer Lamborghinis to Ferraris, you're all set now! There's also apparently an Unofficial Patch that fixes bugs and adds content, though I haven't tried it. So yeah, this game is like Jason Voorhees. Technically dead, but not down for the count. And still eager to entertain. ###			"

												I did own this game for a short time on PS3 before picking it up again on PC. The UpLauncher is completely redundant and annoying. Takes far too long to do whatever it does just to get the game loaded. This can be replaced with a more streamlined community made launcher that is much faster. The controls and/or physics are comical. The cars feel like bricks on wheels. When it comes to driving, use a controller. Whether it be for a console or PC directly, use it. I did attempt to use a steering wheel and that went nowhere. The cars’ handling becomes twitchy and recalcitrant. There are bits of glitches as expected. Most are ones I experienced on the console version. Gameplay visual performance is well optimized. On an older machine I was able to have a few the settings on High or Very High while most remained on Medium. Behind the scenes performance is lacking. You can easily tell this a port from most likely the XBOX version to PC rather than a full PC build from the start. The basic storyline can be finished in a matter of days. So don’t expect it to last long.Not all is bad! All of the content on the PC is identical to the console versions. There is almost 2,000 miles of open road to explore spread among two islands. There are 176 cars to drive about in ranging from classics to suvs to supercars. Lesser known small time automakers like Ascari and Ginetta are present. There is enough side content to keep you busy in solo or offline mode. (I think the servers a dead now? I can’t seem to get online at all.) The environment is well made and adequate for an arcade racer. If you simply want to cruise an open world and look at scenery, this game fits that well. If you are an avid car fan, there is just something pleasing about saving up to buy that one car you have had your eye on. There is plethora of dream cars to fill your garages with. Engine sounds are decent. Some are less than accurate. Overall, I would suggest this game simply for the open world and car selection. Not for the racing or the story. There is an avid community still present for this game. Improvements and more content can be found via an unofficial patch.  "

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 (TDU2) is a a great game, it functions like an MMO with a persistant world where you meet other drivers everywhere. Not only does it have alot of cars, but you can buy houses, clothes, haircuts even plastic surgery, so there's enough customization. There's also a club system which is essentially the same as any guild system in other MMO's the clubs reward you with special cars and clothes.And if you care to spend a little extra you can get the casino ""expansion"" which brings a casino with roulette, poker etc. As well as even more clothes, furniture and cars.The only bad thing I have to say is about the car handling. It's not broken, it's just very hard to get around. But once you *do* get around it, playing TDU2 will be a fun experience, especially if you have some friends whom you can ""cruise"" Ibiza and Hawaii with! "

												Not sure why so many peope having issues with this game. Plays beautifully at max settings for me with a pair of GTX 660s in SLI. Smooth as butter, with Vsync off.Working with my Thrustmaster T150 wheel, with T3PA pedals and a pair of TH8A shifters... one for shifting and the other for handbrake. I was worried about this, since racing games with anything but my racing cockpit simply sucks.I'm connected and being challenged to races by other players. I am declining since I am just learning the game so far and have no upgrades.Love the game, I like the fact that the view turns into corners in cockpit view, something from the old Cross Racing Championship 2005 game that I wish all race games would have. Plenty of cars to choose from. Obviously, they don't handle like a sim but that's not what I bought this game for. Open world cruising like Need For Speed World was with some upgrading of you character elements. Buying new houses, garages, clothes, cosmetically changing your looks, etc. Kinda goofy but kinda cool at the same time.The scales is huge, I had to drive 2 miles to see the cosmetic doctor and it felt like it.Steam Summer sale for the win! Wish I bought it last year when I was thinking about it.			"

												The original Test Drive Unlimited has been my favorite racing game for years. What I love is that you have the entire island of Oahu to drive around on. You can race in the 4 or 5 different racing modes they offer, but you can also just cruize around the island for literally hours discovering new roads and places. Test Drive Unlimited 2 takes this a step farther, now you start off on the island of Ibiza, and you eventually will be able to unlock the island of Oahu once again. This game is highly, highly recommended.			"

												This game will put to test your morality and make you question who you really are. It contains a campaign which leads you to make choices which affect peoples' lives with visceral but lifelike graphics. I have never played a game which was so profound and I would go as far as to say that this is the best game of 2012. The storyline is what matters here and if you can see past the mediocre gameplay, you will think deeply about the nature of violence and whether human intervention can turn out to be more harmful than helpful.

												Overall a good racing game, however not as good as TDU (the original). My favorite aspects are the car sounds (pretty spot on, except TDU's shifting sounded more fluent), the open road/free roam, the houses you can buy and its fun going into to car dealerships to test drive, and even more rewarding to buy a car. Fun with friends to cruise around, driving physics can be set to very realistic. The Test Drive series is not quite as good as the Forza Horizons, but it comes close. If you like cars and a luxury lifestyle, you will enjoy this game.			"

												Total garbage.The 80s called and want their physics back.... since when can a ferrari be used for rock crawling? This is just a news to me. The drive feels very fake. I am not talking about cars not having the same handeling they would in life. The drive feel is more on par with mario cart than anything.This game is designed by people who like cars because they look pretty.Controlls are terrible. Deafult binding is on the arrow keys and cars are automatic by deafult. But, it doesnt stop there. You are expected  to walk around and talk to people while using a mouse as well.I am not sure what kind of work went into the developement of this game but playtesting was not a part of it.TL-DR: Don't buy this game.

(kinda got stuck at the first license in hawaii, seriously, if you beat that time trial around a set of road at the first license u have to unlock once you get to hawaii on your first try, you deserve a ♥♥♥♥ing gold medal. the time limit is incredably strict.)ok cons, not to many to be honest but here we go -UpLauncher. just. UpLauncher.too much paid dlc, seriously u can spend like an aditonal 90-100 dollars on the dlc.licenses can be an absoulte pain to get, which u have to get to enter certaint events to continue with the story.story is not very in-depth or high quality, but its a racing game, racing games can have good storys, but cut it some slack, imo.ok thats about what i have to say for the most part.ill edit this when i beat the first hawaii license time trial and see the rest of the game.lol.overall i recommend it, just get good before u hit hawaii otherwise uill probly get stuck on the time trial for the first license just like i did, lolmy score untill i get past time trial and see rest of game: 8.6/10just ♥♥♥♥ UpLauncher, make the paid dlc free dlc, and ill probly rate it higher.ok heres your tl;dr:nice game with good graphics for 2011, dont ♥♥♥♥ing complain over graphics. it was 2011.plenty of cars, nice online system, and plenty of ♥♥♥♥ to get out of this for only 20 dollars.what are you doing down here you nerd			"

Yes its a driving and discovery game - but that is it's charm.  Pick a car and drive around a beautifully rendered (if someone barren) landscape at high speed, drift between two busses and collect the bounty.With any game a buy, I like to get 1hr play for every £1 spent.  This has already reached that goal (great Sale item!) and I'm still playing.			"

												I love Test Drive Unlimited. It is one of the few games I can think of that invovle a Customizable car, a variety of car choices, and customizing your personal my TDU2 Avatar character in game. I love the game. There are a few design flaws. One of the flaws is apart from the Console versions and the PC is diffrent. One of the things is if you say, bought a car from the PSN as an option, can't have it for PC, another change is the amount of players, there is more or less people who speak English on the consoles then PC. There is also another thing you should be concerned about for the PC vs. Console. One is the number of hackers is on the PC, that cheat on leaderboards, cheat with tanked cars and indestructible cars and infinite cash. Apart from these game flaws, this game is a lot of fun. You can meet a lot of people. You can race others, unlock cars in races or Chase mode. Make a lot of friends and even more personalize yourself with cars, your avatar In game, and buy a number of houses. I only wish if the game was like the previous one, is which you can access the TDU Island or some areas like Casino DLC. All in all, you can say the game is fun and I highly recommend if your not a Need For Speed fan or if you are. I love this game and Need For Speed.			"

												Enjoyable racing game. Features the islands of Ibiza and Hawaii, which means plenty of roads to race on! Or instead of racing the races you could of course just do some relaxing sightseeing, test drive the cars you can't afford (yet), replace the furniture in your house or get cosmetically adjusted. Yes, this game also has some Sims-like aspects lol, but fortunately these are, as far I can tell with only 9 hours in, only aesthetic. Oh and you play online 'by default', making the game kind of MMO. This makes it easy to play races vs other players, since (in non-race mode) they are always driving around in the same world anyway.			"

												If you liked test drive unlimited and you play using a wheel, do NOT BUY THIS GAME. I read some of the reviews posted on steam and decided to buy this game for a bit of fun while off work. I feel compelled to post this to make the glowing reveiws come in to perspective with the reality of the games playability. After buying the game I was soon aware of its minor fault. Absolutly unplayable with a wheel. Not a major fault deemed by the game producers so it will not be addressed until the major faults are fixed, stuff like the stickers on the cars are not availabe in all colors in the chinese version. Two years have passed since this was posted by the makers on TDU2's website and the game is still useless with a logitech MOMO or as google searches suggest ANY other wheel. Search google do not trust steam reviews, including this one if you wish, but its on the mark.			"

The moment they go down, this review turns into negative.________________________________________Tragicomic summary of what happens when the servers go down:- So the game servers are down- Click steam support- Click this game- Steam apologizes for ""not being able to provide support for games by third party developers""- Wtf? So basically f**k all except half life, dota and portal?- Anyway, there are 4 external links for help, so that's something (not that one couldn't find them by themselves)- Click first link -> goes to broken Atari website- Click second link -> goes to exact same broken site (why put it there if it's the same link steam? seriously wtf)- Click third link -> goes to same f**king broken website- Click the final link -> goes to another broken atari website. ♥♥♥♥ing great- Stupid f**king facts atm:- Not being able to play this game.- No support from developer to fix the issue.- No solution from Steam.- Also no refund because it's been 4 years since purchase and 78 hours of gaming.- But the matter of fact is that this product is not working, and I didn't sign the contract for such a possibility.- Steam keeps selling the game- There are purchases as recent as March 6th.- F**k you Atari- Steam is indifferent and/or dumb to this problem			"

												DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM WHO SPEAK ABOUT THE GRAPHICAL OUTCOME OF THIS GAME.Now you need to understand this game has been out for quiet sometime and some people are too blinded by modern day hardware they forget that games did once look like that. I will say this however, if you are looking for a racing game that has an intense storyline and has a strong theme to it then this is not the game for you at all.HOWEVER, if you're looking for a game to simply have access to a very large range of cars in which you can drive hours on end around mulitple islands at a very good speed then this is the game for you, yes it will lack compared to todays games but is that not a little bit obvious?It gives you a wide range of hours if you look past that and work towards owning some of the cars.Plus its not like its expensive...

												Pros1. Two fully open world islands to explore2. Tons of nicely detailed cars to choose and drive3. you can own houses, apartment rooms, mansions, yachts, etc4. Tons of singleplayer events to do5. Graphics are good for a game of this magnitude6. You can buy and own clothing for your character, get a hair cut etc.Cons1. Terrible voice acting2. Characters are stereotypical rich people that are boring yet annoying ( accompanying the terrible voice acting)3.  After all the updates there are still pop ups in civilian cars and buildings4. AI can be stupid to sometimes unfair5. Multiplayer to me is unaccessible due to network issues, not sure if it works for others.Mixed1. Driving is so-so but could be better2. Some good music in the radio stations in the game, the DJs can be annoying though again due to terrible voice acting.3. Vehicle customization could be better with more variety but you can customize your car by its paint color, rims, vinyls and performance wisePerformance wise. on my computer i can run it at high settings with some settings custom . frame rate ranges from 40-60 FPS.It's an alright game. i somewhat recommend it if you can oversee the cons of it. only buy it if you think you'll enjoy it. read other reviews for a better insight on their experience of the game. for now its a thumbs up.

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 all about cars (and 3 sport bikes) and roaming around entire island. It's fun , but not realy. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. game so much todo but get repetitif sing all you do is driving around and take challenges, from andrenaline, topspeed, time limit, convoi, etc. The portion of the chalange reuse over and over with the same dialogue cutscene.AI doesn't give player any good, they drive slow and easy to beat. Well, You can try to play online and face a real player,but since the connection is poor, and lately server is unknown.(read:today) all you can do is drive around in empty vast island.When it comes to the actual driving, there are just as many conflicting issues. I respect the game's attempt to bridge the gap between arcade-style racing and realistic simulation controls. But ultimately the cars in Test Drive lack the visceral quality that real vehicles possess.  I felt like I was controlling a toy.My self Recommend this to enyone who love cars and driving around island and find collectible, but not recommend to player who seek challlange in race.			"

												There has been up and downs about this game. I've played this game since the day it came out and played it before steam, I loved the game and the freedom it gives you. You can ride wherever you want on the two islands and exploring is fun, the championships are fun and can be a bit challening sometimes (some races are just too easy). But the thing is that this game is very unstable when it comes to the servers and DLC cars, some months ago the servers were down but now they seem to work perfectly. When it comes to the game itself I like the driving physics, it comes with a realistic feeling and let's not forget the great motorcycle physics. Apart from the driving, the crashing part can be very unrealistic and sometimes when you hit a sidewalk your car can completely stop out of nowhere which will make you very mad. There are plenty of cars to choose from, if you like muscle cars or just sports cars there are plenty of options. The game divides the vehicles into three groups with smaller groups within. A cars, B cars and C cars. A cars are sports/muslce cars and are the fastest vehicles in the game, thus making them my favorite. The B cars are offroad and are stronger cars that has very good offroad handling (apart from A and C cars). C cars are the classics and are older veteran cars which are slower but fun to drive.In summary, this game by date is very fun and I would recommend it for those who love car games and free roam games.

												I did own this game for a short time on PS3 before picking it up again on PC. The UpLauncher is completely redundant and annoying. Takes far too long to do whatever it does just to get the game loaded. This can be replaced with a more streamlined community made launcher that is much faster. The controls and/or physics are comical. The cars feel like bricks on wheels. When it comes to driving, use a controller. Whether it be for a console or PC directly, use it. I did attempt to use a steering wheel and that went nowhere. The cars’ handling becomes twitchy and recalcitrant. There are bits of glitches as expected. Most are ones I experienced on the console version. Gameplay visual performance is well optimized. On an older machine I was able to have a few the settings on High or Very High while most remained on Medium. Behind the scenes performance is lacking. You can easily tell this a port from most likely the XBOX version to PC rather than a full PC build from the start. The basic storyline can be finished in a matter of days. So don’t expect it to last long.Not all is bad! All of the content on the PC is identical to the console versions. There is almost 2,000 miles of open road to explore spread among two islands. There are 176 cars to drive about in ranging from classics to suvs to supercars. Lesser known small time automakers like Ascari and Ginetta are present. There is enough side content to keep you busy in solo or offline mode. (I think the servers a dead now? I can’t seem to get online at all.) The environment is well made and adequate for an arcade racer. If you simply want to cruise an open world and look at scenery, this game fits that well. If you are an avid car fan, there is just something pleasing about saving up to buy that one car you have had your eye on. There is plethora of dream cars to fill your garages with. Engine sounds are decent. Some are less than accurate. Overall, I would suggest this game simply for the open world and car selection. Not for the racing or the story. There is an avid community still present for this game. Improvements and more content can be found via an unofficial patch.  "

												Yes, the Test Drive studio has unfortunately closed, so not sure how well multiplayer interactions function anymore, which was one of this games' stronger selling points. And yes, there are better car renderings and more of them in Gran Turismo. Forza's latest iterations allow more in-depth car customization. TDU2 isn't the most fluid or glitch free title either. But no title does what this one does: combining excellent car exterior and interior rendering, paint customization limited only by your creativity and, most of all, providing a truly vast expanse of roads to free-roam on the islands of Hawaii and Ibiza all in one package. There's even shops to customize your avatar and houses to buy if that's your thing. If you can get past the incredibly lame race introduction dialogue, this game truly has everything and is my favorite free-roam, and actually favorite non-arcade style racing game (sans the GRID series). Would advise creating an offline account and playing it for what it is unless you can verify online modes are still operational.			"

												I'm a big fan of driving games, whether it be GRID, Forza, Gran Turismo... you name it I've played it.Test Drive Unlimited 2 got a lot of bad ratings from companies, but they never understood what it was made for. It wasn't designed for racing, yeah it had a racing storyline on the side, but coming from TDU1, it was all about driving around a beautiful island with your friends calmly and enjoying the scenery.So if you are looking for a game where you drive to 3 million miles an hour crashing at every corner, go play need for speed. But if you're looking for that one game you actually enjoy doing nothing but driving around on... this is for you.Most underated driving game of all time.If I had to choose my most favorite driving game... this would be No. 1.

												Let's get this out of the way: this is a terrible racing game. The driving physics are broken, the cars aren't balanced relative to the classes the game puts them in, vehicle upgrades are extremely generic and there is no tuning whatsoever.Race events range from laughably easy (most races with actual AI racers due to the laughably bad AI) to frustratingly difficult (the time trials where the AI posts amazing times that don't match up at all to their actual racing skill in the races). The game also forces you to go through various licensing challenges to even enter the race events which are a series of frustrating time trials, often in spin-happy RWD cars.If you're looking for a racing sim, stop reading this now and go look elsewhere.As for specifically what wrong with this game:The physics engine heavily favors AWD cars, RWD cars spin out way too easily and its near impossible to recover once that happens. Even the AWD cars will randomly spin out at times, but at least they're more resistant to it and much easier to recover.In most vehicle classes, there is one ""I WIN"" car that is so much better than all other cars in the class that the others aren't even worth considering for racing.Vehicle upgrades are limited to speed, acceleration, and braking with 4 levels for each. There is no option to tune or put better tires on to try to fix the crazy tailspin on most of the cars.So why did I recommend this game? Simply put, it's an excellent driving game. You have two real world islands to explore, (Ibizia and Oahu) and both are 1:1 scale that completely dwarfs the world in the likes of Forza Horizon. There are plenty of hidden secrets to find and scenic vistas, and a completely free multiplayer free roam where you can randomly encounter other players crusing around and potentially challenge them to a race.There's a few other quirks worth mentioning as well. You have the option to customize your avatar, but no matter what you do they look weird. You also have a limited number of garage spots for new cars and you have to buy new houses to get more which gets very expensive very quickly and is the main financial limiting factor early in the game. The monetary cost of cosmetic things is way high ($300 for a haircut!?!). 5 machine activation limit is unecessary additional drm to be aware of, at least it gives you an activation back if you uninstall it.The game is moddable and there are a few community patches to add new cars and fix some of the issues, but I haven't seen any patches that manage to fully fix all the issues with the game.Overall, I still recommend this game if you enjoy just driving around and exploring more than racing.

												A fully open world massively multiplayer racing simulator that also has character customization is what distinguishes this driving game from the others.The game feels ambitious but tried to juggle too many concepts and ideas at once. Car handling has an arcade feel as compared to other more realistic driving games.It is still fun however mainly due to the game's huge open world in which you can spend hours just lazily cruising along. Exploration is encouraged and rewarding. Graphics are not bad looking. The licensed music included had a nice selection and was a joy to listen to.Multiplayer was a hit and miss. Although i could see other human players, i couldn't see my friend even though we were at the same location. It was a shame as we couldn't drive co-operatively as we had planned. Had it worked well, i would have given it a much higher score.Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10A promising game with flaws. Worth to buy on sale if you are looking for an open world driving game.			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 all about cars (and 3 sport bikes) and roaming around entire island. It's fun , but not realy. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. game so much todo but get repetitif sing all you do is driving around and take challenges, from andrenaline, topspeed, time limit, convoi, etc. The portion of the chalange reuse over and over with the same dialogue cutscene.AI doesn't give player any good, they drive slow and easy to beat. Well, You can try to play online and face a real player,but since the connection is poor, and lately server is unknown.(read:today) all you can do is drive around in empty vast island.When it comes to the actual driving, there are just as many conflicting issues. I respect the game's attempt to bridge the gap between arcade-style racing and realistic simulation controls. But ultimately the cars in Test Drive lack the visceral quality that real vehicles possess.  I felt like I was controlling a toy.My self Recommend this to enyone who love cars and driving around island and find collectible, but not recommend to player who seek challlange in race.			"

												This was a fantastic driving game in its time.  Huge map, dozens of cars, and plenty of things to do and see.  The multiplayer servers have been down a lot as of late, but the single player game is still fairly solid if you wanna run around Hawaii and Ibiza at 200+mph.			"

												At first you're going to hate this game, the heavy focus on social life like sims 3, the horrible handling and the slow paced story really got on my nerve. But that's always calmed down behind the wheel. The game is beautiful, with astonishing graphics, crazy environments and just great sounds, until you get interrupted by the GPS or a story person. But you can overlook that, because entering races is so easy and an enjoyable time to pass by. Only get it if you liked the first game, or you just like collecting cars.			"

												7.5/10This game was fun. I enjoyed driving around a pretty vast space and discovering things. Only thing lacking was any kind of car damage and honestly, the game could have done without the offroad portion. Otherwise, an overall enjoyable experience. The GUI in-game seemed clunky, but otherwise, not too much I can criticize. Not the most vast selection of cars, but enough to have fun with for sure. Virtually no storyline. Graphics were decent enough. Music - I prefered my own to the in-game.			"

												Since the First Test Drive i have played this game, its a game which i thought would end at the first game but it is such a massive open world game with many many cars, and since they brought out the new one (Test Drive 2), they have continued with the legacy of hawaii and the new map (well you have to find out! :p if you havent already played it). Eden Studios have produced an excellent game in my opinion, and the new features which they have introduced are very attractive and I will continue to play this game. I have played well over 100hours on my xbox but i am new to the pc gaming world and when i have more free time, i will  once again roam the casino.			"

												TDU2 is a stellar game, though a little dated now, it still looks and sounds quite pleasing. If you liked the first TDU, then this is an obvious buy.TDU2 can either be a long slow game or a fast intense game, depending on how you want to play it. There is always plenty to do and exploring is always half the fun. I always suggest driving around and unlocking 75% of the roads in Ibiza's area 2 before you get into the racing scene as this helps with car selection and gives you level 3 performance upgrades for the first few cars you will need (C4, A7, A6 and B4). It takes a decent amount of time just to drive around and unlock roads, but atleast for me it's worth it in the end and you will notice a good diffrence having that level 3 or 4 performance upgrade in those harder races. Level 1/2 upgrades are rarely worth it imo so spend the time and get atleast 75% in Ibiza area 2 right off the bat, then Ibiza 1 and Hawaii 1 (for the high end A1 car's like the Veyron and CCX) later.In the end this is a very addicting racing game that can be intense at times and laid back in others. If you like open world racing games with a plathora of cars from silly hatchbacks to Bugatti's, this one is a no brainer!			"

												This was a great game in many ways and left lacking in others. The cars were great in detail and sound. The scenery and roads were also done very well and the challenges were fun if a little buggy at times. With so much good put into the game it seemed sadly that the development team stopped trying and let hackers just run wild. All the community challenges would be dominated by people winning the race in 1sec or less and there is little to do it seems in end game after doing everything besides to drive around in your bugatti challenging noobs to races. One of the better race games out there based on the cars, i reccomend this but it is old and dying off. Make sure you get it cheap at this point.			"

												Even though it's not a simulation, but more of an arcade racer, TDU2 just sounds, looks and feels good. There is more than enough to do, find, explore and see in single- and multiplayer with a nice mixture of racing events and just relaxing on the road. I just can't mention often enough how relaxing it feels to drive your Ferrari California over one of the beautiful islands.Technically I found very few argue about. The graphics are smooth, the game itself is very stable, everything is nicely configurable and network connections are good as well.If there is something that could be improved, I'd mention a few more (2-3) different mission designs, a bit more life aside from the streets and slightly better player models.So if you think that driving a nice car can be just as good as racing over Ibiza or Oahu with more than 1000 bhp, you might want to check out TDU2.

												I've tried and tried to love this game , and all i come off with is a ""sorta like"". EDIT: Having played this game a lot more I can say i am at the point where i like it a lot . Maybe its the lack of really compelling car games in recent years but i'd have to say this is one of the better car games out there now. The good: Great open world driving enormous social aspectdeccent (but not the best ) car physicsEDIT: Off road racing The bad:world feels empty compared to the original.  EDIT: it fills empty as  it lacks the ammount of single player racing courses the first game offered. THat said there is stil a lot here.  There are a hella lot of MP courses. Lack of American cars that were in the first game (seriously WTF the only corvette is a DLC one????!!! that's my favorite car period). EDIT: Don't get me wrong there are a good offering on american cars but they only make up about a 1/4th the cars in the game where the original TDU it was 50/50 , and yes some of the beter american cars are DLC. The largest portion of the  purely social aspect is also DLC (i'm looking at you casino) Lacks the  easy to set up user radio station  the first game had and in my opinion the games default stations blow.  EDIT: Requires Atari Tokens to buy DLC, and they only accept paypal as a method for purchase. EDIT: Those god @#$% driving test will have you yanking out your hair. In General I've been some what disapointed with racing games this past few years. This game being one of those.  Its not a bad game but it did disapoint i was hoping for better.  I give this game  a 6.5 out of 10, there is some fun to be had but if you played the first one don't expect much out of this one.  EDIT: all that said  I give the game a revised score of 7.5 , it's worth the purchase.			"

												The game is really good, lots of missions, huge maps. Car handling could perhaps be better but it just takes a little time to get use to it. The cut scenes are terrible for their cheesy dialog and story line, but it is a car game after all so it’s just best to ignore them end enjoy the rest of the game. I don’t know of another racing game on the PC that features huge maps and has so many cars to drive.			"

												Is this game fun? ♥♥♥♥ yeah.Is it a driving simulator? ♥♥♥♥ no.The very definition of an arcade style racer. The driving is extremely satisfying and fun, but surely not realistic.The fact that you get a character/avatar that you can customize, get a house to store your cars, and can upgrade all of it, is great fun. Finally a reason to keep racing, and a fun one at that. You can walk through the car dealerships and look at cars, like what you see? Take it for a Test Drive not so Unlimited (since you get 2 minutes to test it). All in all a great experience to drive around the sunny Ibiza and Hawaii in exotic cars, or crappy ones, because you can get those too.Not all without trouble though, the game comes with a bit of a manual, but not one you can read. To get it to work might take some time (Or none at all, if you're lucky). But its all worth it.			"

												The original Test Drive Unlimited has been my favorite racing game for years. What I love is that you have the entire island of Oahu to drive around on. You can race in the 4 or 5 different racing modes they offer, but you can also just cruize around the island for literally hours discovering new roads and places. Test Drive Unlimited 2 takes this a step farther, now you start off on the island of Ibiza, and you eventually will be able to unlock the island of Oahu once again. This game is highly, highly recommended.			"

												|| bought this in the steam sale as I wanted a driving sim that I could use my Sim-Raceway controller with (I have F1 2013 but it sucks).I love this game in single player.  Yes its a driving and discovery game - but that is it's charm.  Pick a car and drive around a beautifully rendered (if someone barren) landscape at high speed, drift between two busses and collect the bounty.With any game a buy, I like to get 1hr play for every £1 spent.  This has already reached that goal (great Sale item!) and I'm still playing.			"

												I love Test Drive Unlimited. It is one of the few games I can think of that invovle a Customizable car, a variety of car choices, and customizing your personal my TDU2 Avatar character in game. I love the game. There are a few design flaws. One of the flaws is apart from the Console versions and the PC is diffrent. One of the things is if you say, bought a car from the PSN as an option, can't have it for PC, another change is the amount of players, there is more or less people who speak English on the consoles then PC. There is also another thing you should be concerned about for the PC vs. Console. One is the number of hackers is on the PC, that cheat on leaderboards, cheat with tanked cars and indestructible cars and infinite cash. Apart from these game flaws, this game is a lot of fun. You can meet a lot of people. You can race others, unlock cars in races or Chase mode. Make a lot of friends and even more personalize yourself with cars, your avatar In game, and buy a number of houses. I only wish if the game was like the previous one, is which you can access the TDU Island or some areas like Casino DLC. All in all, you can say the game is fun and I highly recommend if your not a Need For Speed fan or if you are. I love this game and Need For Speed.			"

												This game will put to test your morality and make you question who you really are. It contains a campaign which leads you to make choices which affect peoples' lives with visceral but lifelike graphics. I have never played a game which was so profound and I would go as far as to say that this is the best game of 2012. The storyline is what matters here and if you can see past the mediocre gameplay, you will think deeply about the nature of violence and whether human intervention can turn out to be more harmful than helpful.

												59 hours on record?... wow no way. I remember playing this game, but not that much. I must have had it minimized for about half of those hours.This game was really fun, and for most of us that will never own any car better than an El Camino - this is the only place where you can feel some semi-real physics for specific car makes and models. Not that I would really know, but hey who can refute that claim! I really liked the story, the challenges, and dodging the cops.The only downfall to this game is that is kept freezing... I put up with that for about 30 hours or so, but after that I could not take it anymore. Hopefully they fixed that issue by now. I know some of my friends had the same issue and so we all stopped playing this. We probably should've written a review like 3 years ago when we were playing, but hey... who has time to write reviews? It's not like anyone is paying us to do so.   :P			"

												#updateThe things written below are still true, BUT the guys of eden were not able to fix one of the most relevant patches from TDU 1 - the save game corruption bug, which still occurs quite often and ♥♥♥♥s up a whole profile with potentially hours of gameplay beeing lost. Therefore I reconsidered recommendation to ""no""#When TDU 2 was released in first place it got a lot of mediocore reviews from the gaming sites and also from community. Driving physics, network issues and also the graphics engine were low-rated aspects in the opinion of many. Back then I didn't buy the game despite the fact that I *loved* TDU 1.Now I actually bought the game and can state, that it lives up to its predecessor.TDU 2 is once again - as the name says - centered around cruising with all kinds of want-to-have cars in a beautiful environment. The driving doesn't actually feel like what other driving simulators tell us how driving such cars should feel like. Changing the assistance level doesn't change that. But thats not a problem in my opinion. I totally have a good time on Ibiza island. Graphics are nice but not overwhelming. Story mode is okay. Race modes are fun and the driving licences have been somewhat challenging so far. I am looking forward doing the huge amount of tasks and races, filling my growing numbers of estates with fancy cars and exploring the island via its roads and offsite tracks.Totally worth buying it.

												### Updated to reflect some changes ###This game is not just about racing. It is the ultimate rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator. You roll around Ibiza and Hawaii in your supercar and mingle with similar rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s - buying expensive clothes, accoutrements, real estate and gambling. You can practcally see the flashing of dollar bills and the glinting of the bleached teeth.The only thing that's missing is the ability to DUI. And that you can fix by roleplaying. Maybe really delve deep into the role and have a few pints or do some rails while playing. Who am I to judge?It's worth mentioning that some 30 minutes into the game a woman named after a Southern US city insulted my taste in fashion. And this happened in a game supposedly about racing cars.### UPDATE: The online features are gone, and most of the DLC content is no longer available (some vehicles and the DLC missions still remain - bikes are all gone though). Still, there's a good chunk of single player content in this. This is still a game that allows you to cruise around on not one, but two sizeable tropical islands in a decent selection of vehicles, ranging from a Golf GTI to a Koeningsegg CCRX with some legendary classics like the Lancia Delta Integrale or the Jaguar E-Type thrown in as well. All of them nicely modeled with fully detailed interiors, which is not a given even in standard titles like Gran Turismo.And folks have even managed to mod new cars into the game (though sadly only through replacing vanilla ones, as far as I know), so for instance if you prefer Lamborghinis to Ferraris, you're all set now! There's also apparently an Unofficial Patch that fixes bugs and adds content, though I haven't tried it. So yeah, this game is like Jason Voorhees. Technically dead, but not down for the count. And still eager to entertain. ###			"

												I would recommend this game to anyone. I feel it has great overall gameplay. Could have been much better with a stronger car list and customzation but it has great aspects to it. It can be a bit buggy in certain areas and playing online is sometimes a pain to get in the same sessions as friends but overall for the price and level of content i feel it is pretty strong. 6.5/10			"

												This game is awesome it has a giant island for oyu to explore and you can go in road trips that take hours and never see the same thing. Another reason is that it has such a variety of cars to use which comes in handy seeing as if you see it you can go there applies ot most  of the island. You can also buy an apartment or house to customize. I liked that this game was based online which gives you two options while your playing with no menus or loading screens, you can play the singleplayer stuff and seemlessly play multiplayer things inbetween.

												This is no doubt one of my most favorate games in my Steam library, It is fun and chalanging to anyone. You can play in races on your own or with other people online, collect cars and explore a large humungus world.There is one thing you must strongly bear in mind though.Eden games, the company that made Test Drive Unlimeted, has been closed by the publisher Atari and as a result, it is highly unlikely to receve any updates or services from them.A massive knock-on effect to this, is that when the severs go down, they dont just go down for an hour of so, they go down for days, or possibly even weeks.But in sumary, this game is good, when the server is up.

												Well, it is a mixed bag. The game gets a few things right really well, and really messes up some other parts. It is not a racing game for fanatics looking for realism and special racing cars on special circuits. This is a casual racer, but I think there are games in that genre that handles better like NFS Hot Pursuit 2 and Burnout Paradise (the best game still).AND, the online never really works. I think it has been abandoned for a while actually. I do recommend it even if there is no online. If you do care about online then obviously forget this one. Oh, and play with a 360-controller. It just does not work very well with any other option if you want to do well. I tried with a steering-wheel too, and it made everything worse even though lots of fun. What is great? The idea of driving around freely on an island is fantastic. If you actually want to drive more ""normal"" cars on the road and not just race in circles this is the game for you. You can play the game like Truck simulator 2 if you wish, just driving around, enjoying the scenery and your cars. Even if that is very simple, the game does this part extremely well. The cars look great, the island(s) look great. Lots of freedom. Nice weather. You can buy nice houses and fix your car. Great cockpit view for immersion. There is quite a lot to do on the island(s). Lots of nice cars to try. The races are ok, and there is a welcome addition of off-road driving that is probably the most fun in the game. More on that later.What is not too great? They whole story mode is just incredibly silly and forced. Every cut-scene feels written by a person who couldn't smell funny even if it would be served on a silver platter under their nose, but has rather looked up the word funny on the internet and plastered a bunch of horrible cliches together. Everything feels forced and is rather embarrassing. And the voice-overs are sooo bad. They are just trying too hard, making it sound incredibly unnatural and disconnected. ""Look, I'm so happy and crazy!!!!!"" They audio is also so repetitive that it becomes ridiculous and has nothing to do with the situation you are in. It really feels like they hired the cheapest voice talent with absolutely no previous experience except for perhaps unemotional robots. The radio is the same. Some good music and some interesting ideas, but they are not funny, at all... Compared to GTA-radio it is just embarrassing. And what is up with the people on this island? They all look like they come from the movie the Stepford Wives. It is downright creepy actually. The vision between the ""car-game"" and the ""world"" seems like two different planets. This corporate ugly plastic vision with no taste or style destroys the game.The sounds of the cars are really bad. Especially the SUVs. The devs just did not try at all here. They sound nothing like a real car, just a like cheap synth pitched up and down. Really surprising when you consider the details in the rest of the game.And, DLCs for extra cars...RacesSo, the challenges are ok, fun and varied but I HATE the time trials. I HATE them!!!! Because it is totally unforgiving. I don't mind that there is a challenge but it makes no sense the way it is set-up this game. In normal races you can mess up, and catch up the others, the race is not over if you make ONE small mistake. But in the time trials, you better just start over if you mess up. This becomes more hairpullingly annoying when some of the time trials are 5 minutes long and you make a mistake at the end of that track and you have to start over. And every time you start over you have to see an annoying cut-scene. To make you scream a bit more they also added a game-mechanic that is just there to slap you in the face: On time trials, if you drive off the road just even slightly, a timer starts ticking, removing time from your total!!!! I understand the reason: they thought that you should not be able to cheat by taking a shortcut, but the fact is that the cars handle so poorly off-road that it would never be a good option to do so anyway. You gain nothing by driving off-road, your car slows down a lot AND you get punished for it as well time-wise. There is also a challenge where you have to drive around the entire island, which takes about 50 minutes. Actually a rather neat idea if you  have the time for it. Here, I think they realized the problem I am talking about because it is fairly easy to do that one and have plenty of time left, but I wish the time trials were a little easier. They are just frustrating as it is.The game has good FPS in general but I have to say that the 3D-engine is not greatly optimized and you will not get a great performance if your computer is a little older. Lots of pop-ins and stutter unless you don't mind lowering the quality quite a but. Many games do a lot better.Despite all the negativity I like the game in the end. It is the only game that does what it does, and the good parts it does rather well. I do recommend it on a sale. You do get a lot even though the online does not work. I have enjoyed it, except for the need to vomit every time the cut-scenes come in.			"

												Unfortunately, Arari has had a rough time. The effort they have put into this game compared to the first is incredible and comendable. It feels as though the game has a lesser range of cars and definetely a smaller range of bikes, which was a massive hit in the first game. The introduction of casinos, licences and new club features is fantastic. The introduction of the new island, Ibiza is also a great bonus to this game. Unfortunately, a PayPal account is needed if the player wishes to purchase in game goods, and no other payment methods are currently avalible. Still, a fantastic game and is worth $19. All the best Atari.9/10			"

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 all about cars (and 3 sport bikes) and roaming around entire island. It's fun , but not realy. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. game so much todo but get repetitif sing all you do is driving around and take challenges, from andrenaline, topspeed, time limit, convoi, etc. The portion of the chalange reuse over and over with the same dialogue cutscene.AI doesn't give player any good, they drive slow and easy to beat. Well, You can try to play online and face a real player,but since the connection is poor, and lately server is unknown.(read:today) all you can do is drive around in empty vast island.When it comes to the actual driving, there are just as many conflicting issues. I respect the game's attempt to bridge the gap between arcade-style racing and realistic simulation controls. But ultimately the cars in Test Drive lack the visceral quality that real vehicles possess.  I felt like I was controlling a toy.My self Recommend this to enyone who love cars and driving around island and find collectible, but not recommend to player who seek challlange in race.			"

The graphics aren't hyper realistic and the physics aren't simulation perfect, take that for what you will, but regardless, the cars are very injoyable to throw around.This game is also lightyears ahead of the original one that I still have for the PSP, which is to be expected. Its something else to play a game that has so closely been linked to my love of cars and driving in new, revamped graphics.			"

I am not talking about cars not having the same handeling they would in life. The drive feel is more on par with mario cart than anything.This game is designed by people who like cars because they look pretty.Controlls are terrible. Deafult binding is on the arrow keys and cars are automatic by deafult. But, it doesnt stop there. You are expected  to walk around and talk to people while using a mouse as well.I am not sure what kind of work went into the developement of this game but playtesting was not a part of it.TL-DR: Don't buy this game.

												Not sure why so many peope having issues with this game. Plays beautifully at max settings for me with a pair of GTX 660s in SLI. Smooth as butter, with Vsync off.Working with my Thrustmaster T150 wheel, with T3PA pedals and a pair of TH8A shifters... one for shifting and the other for handbrake. I was worried about this, since racing games with anything but my racing cockpit simply sucks.I'm connected and being challenged to races by other players. I am declining since I am just learning the game so far and have no upgrades.Love the game, I like the fact that the view turns into corners in cockpit view, something from the old Cross Racing Championship 2005 game that I wish all race games would have. Plenty of cars to choose from. Obviously, they don't handle like a sim but that's not what I bought this game for. Open world cruising like Need For Speed World was with some upgrading of you character elements. Buying new houses, garages, clothes, cosmetically changing your looks, etc. Kinda goofy but kinda cool at the same time.The scales is huge, I had to drive 2 miles to see the cosmetic doctor and it felt like it.Steam Summer sale for the win! Wish I bought it last year when I was thinking about it.			"

												Overall a good racing game, however not as good as TDU (the original). My favorite aspects are the car sounds (pretty spot on, except TDU's shifting sounded more fluent), the open road/free roam, the houses you can buy and its fun going into to car dealerships to test drive, and even more rewarding to buy a car. Fun with friends to cruise around, driving physics can be set to very realistic. The Test Drive series is not quite as good as the Forza Horizons, but it comes close. If you like cars and a luxury lifestyle, you will enjoy this game.			"

												ドライブするだけ。道路が日本と違うので長距離を走れて結構楽しい。ペイントやパーツをカスタマイズしたりね。オンラインで他人とレース（特別なコースがあるわけではなく実際にある道がコース）やパトカーに喧嘩を売り、逃げ切ったり、パトカーに協力して違反者を捕まえたり。お金を稼ぐのはちょっと大変かな？問題はひとつ、DLCの購入について別途公式サイトにて専用のトークンを購入しなければいけいない。SteamでDLC買えればいいんだけどな。もう一つ付け加えるなら車のライセンス料支払いの関係でどこぞの高級メーカーの車は乗れません。内部にデータはあるとかないとか。			"

												Is this game fun? ♥♥♥♥ yeah.Is it a driving simulator? ♥♥♥♥ no.The very definition of an arcade style racer. The driving is extremely satisfying and fun, but surely not realistic.The fact that you get a character/avatar that you can customize, get a house to store your cars, and can upgrade all of it, is great fun. Finally a reason to keep racing, and a fun one at that. You can walk through the car dealerships and look at cars, like what you see? Take it for a Test Drive not so Unlimited (since you get 2 minutes to test it). All in all a great experience to drive around the sunny Ibiza and Hawaii in exotic cars, or crappy ones, because you can get those too.Not all without trouble though, the game comes with a bit of a manual, but not one you can read. To get it to work might take some time (Or none at all, if you're lucky). But its all worth it.			"

												It is honestly hard for me to figure out if I should recommend this game or not.This game has a lot going for it: it has some outstanding gameplay, incredible environments, and immense amounts of customization, but it also has a bunch of issues, including lack of fullscreen, terrible voice acting, no subtitles, and an annoying GPS. If you can handle these minors annoyances along with ridiculously easy AI, I would gladly recommend this game. If you are looking for a challenge, or simply a game that feels a little more whole, you should find a different game.			"

												If you want to enjoy a beautiful scenery and the car selection I would highly recommend it. I love this game so much. :) However, I am very sure if Atari didn't suck ♥♥♥ this game would get great reviews because DLCs would be available, and playing online from the start of the game would be much easier. This game had extreme potential to be amazing, and from what I have read don't blame the game, its the Publisher's main issue. Atari is careless and caused much of Eden's hardships. It is very sad how even politics can ruin a perfectly great game. In conclusion, try to get the online mode before playing offline. Offline is great, but the online features are way better, if the servers don't suck, which unfortunately they usually do. Once again thanks Atari! (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s)			"

												This game isn't for most racing/driving fans. No this game is for the adventures. This game does have a story, but its not to fasinating. In fact i haven't done the 4th step of the main story. This game mostly about you in your car driving around buying cars, exploring the world (which is HUGE) Finding sticker shops, car dealers, and much more. A feature i like from the game is that after you have drove on a road the road will turn blue on the map. This means that you can fast travel to any road you've been on. Which is very helpful.

												Test Drive Unlimited 2 all about cars (and 3 sport bikes) and roaming around entire island. It's fun , but not realy. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. game so much todo but get repetitif sing all you do is driving around and take challenges, from andrenaline, topspeed, time limit, convoi, etc. The portion of the chalange reuse over and over with the same dialogue cutscene.AI doesn't give player any good, they drive slow and easy to beat. Well, You can try to play online and face a real player,but since the connection is poor, and lately server is unknown.(read:today) all you can do is drive around in empty vast island.When it comes to the actual driving, there are just as many conflicting issues. I respect the game's attempt to bridge the gap between arcade-style racing and realistic simulation controls. But ultimately the cars in Test Drive lack the visceral quality that real vehicles possess.  I felt like I was controlling a toy.My self Recommend this to enyone who love cars and driving around island and find collectible, but not recommend to player who seek challlange in race.			"

 Note : This may not be worth the purchase, maybe best off with a torrent, since it's near impossible to run without the Universal Launcher. I feel like my hours in this may be invalid now (again, having to use the Universal Launcher), but that doesn't stop me from saying it's not good. It just really didn't have long lasting servers. If you're looking for online play, then I'd seek another review and some guides.But this game is really good even offline. It's pretty much a poor man's Forza Horizon (although this was 2011 and FH1 was 2012). It's got two open worlds, a  decent	 amount of cars, story that really isn't much worth it, decent music, and even something like the skills system.Getting the bad out of the way, the voice acting and story really isn't great. But why would you need it in a racing game? People also complain about the controls, but my advice is use a controller. Keyboard doesn't do the best justice with turning and it can really make things way too slidy sometimes. You'll slide much less with a controller.The good, just the gameplay and whatever else. Music is, again, just decent. But the gameplay is the main focus here. It's something you sorta have to get used to and once you do it's pretty smooth. Smooth(ish, lack of updates now might show its age) gameplay, graphics, etc. It's just a good racing game. Almost all I can say. Small bit of customization. Even character and house customization. Even DLC if you want to throw money at a dead game.TL;DR : Either wait until this is on sale or torrent it and use the Universal Launcher. It's pretty good. Not bad, but not the best. Definitely enjoyable even if it fits that ""alright"" section.			"

												A great open world game and a nice alternative to your standard racing game.After reading some reviews I was worried that the game might be faulty but thesingleplayer works just fine, not sure about the multiplayer though.			"

												It's a game more about driving cars  than racing. The physics are ""so-so"" but it's challenging to drive correctly.It has a lot of community features like grouping to ride together or.... PLAYING POKER.also the servers are probably off so screw all that.			"

												The Test Drive franchise has ever been an ""also-ran"" compared to more famous franchises like the Need For Speed or the Gran Turismo games, and Unlimited 2 did nothing to improve the series. Although it had a huge open world - still larger than those found in many competing series today - even at the time of its release in 2011, the game looked substantially worse than any other racer and it certainly hasn't improved with time. Worse, it was saddled with an uninteresting TV race show - with the requisite unlikable and shallow characters - as a framing device for level progression. But it's real sin was that it just wasn't fun to drive.The driving mechanics are terrible, with every vehicle over-steering to such a degree that it is almost impossible to drive. Even at low speeds, the cars slip and slide all over the road as if the asphalt were coated with ice; racing is far more chore than adrenalin-fueled excitement. To be fair, driving around the vast open worlds is quite enjoyable - there's a lot to see and find - but this pleasure is hampered by the substandard graphics and the too-slow progression. There's just something wrong if a racer is more fun to drive at 50mph than at 150mph. The game also does its best to force you online - whether you want or not -  with numerous features locked away until you create an online account, but given how empty the online community is these days I wish the developers had put more effort into the single-player.

												I certainly reccomend this game. Depsite having not owned it for too long, I've had tons of fun with it.It's so much fun to just hop in a car and cruise around the island. The graphics aren't hyper realistic and the physics aren't simulation perfect, take that for what you will, but regardless, the cars are very injoyable to throw around.This game is also lightyears ahead of the original one that I still have for the PSP, which is to be expected. Its something else to play a game that has so closely been linked to my love of cars and driving in new, revamped graphics.			"

When I go to buy atari tokens it tells me i gotta enter in all my credit card info which is fine but it doesn't prompt me to enter it in anywhere! it just tells me all the information is missing. HOW DO I ENTER THAT INFORMATION IF THERE IS NO WHERE TO ENTER IT ATARI,The website is an absolute piece of garbage, the game is only 3 years old! fix your ♥♥♥♥. I'm trying to givew you money but your stupid website won't let me.and your game is alright.			"

												Hey you, yeah you! Do you think computer video games are easy? Do you hate touching barrels? Do you like spending more time on the tutorials than actual gameplay? Well then this is the game for you! With over 20 hours of gameplay on driving tests, you will spend more time driving in this game then you do real life!*EDIT*And now, spend even less time enjoying actual gameplay with servers that are dead 99% of the time! Because Atari dosent like this game or something!			"

												This is a nice game for the petrolhead, open world and plenty of cars to choose, but it's missing Atari support, it's hard to find a official forum (Supposing that they exist), also, this game should have ""Steam Cloud"" sycn. A game with this type of exploration and type of levels to rank up it's stupid not to have that option.			"

												A complete downgrade from the original.Cons:- Blocky textures- NPCs that appear closer to blow up dolls than people.- Cars handle like they're solid blocks of concrete with wheels and an engine attached.- Terrible storyline - why include this in a game that offers a ""simulator"" setting?- UI feels like a mid-2000s educational program. Was that a disfigured distant cousin of comic sans?- Being walked through the introductory stage was akin to death by one thousand papercuts - I'd rather end it all early.Pros:- Exit button is easy to find and works smoothly.All in all, horrendously bad in all aspects. I'll be refunding this if I'm within the time limit. There's nothing more to say.			"

												The game is buggy as hell. Several problems launching it or connecting to the servers. Random crashes, too. For me it has completely stopped working as of a few days ago.No online solution I've looked into works for me at all. Atari support is non-existant. And Steam won't do a thing for you if the game crashes and stops working after their refund period (2 weeks of purchase, 2 hours of playtime) has passed.Stay away from this trap.			"
