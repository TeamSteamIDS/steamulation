												I would rate this game 1/10. The game only has about 10 tracks and you can only have up to 4 cars in your race. But wait. There's more. The loading screen's graphics just wants to make you barf. But most importantaly, it looks like a guy made it in 10 minutes and uploaded it to Steam. I played for only 1 minute and it was already the worst game I have ever played.			"

												First Impressions:A very fun game with very similar results to me driving mini RC cars in real life: Lots of wall impacts.The Good:- Game play is realistic- Decent selection and variety of tracks- Not an arcade game where you can just run around at full speedThe Bad:- Menus are hard to use due to background videos at high speed- Only available in full-screen mode. Would be better for me as windowed at specific resolutions on a big screen than being forced to upscale.- Difficult controls from keyboard with on/off for speed and turning.- Doesn't remember settings on restartOverall a mostly positive first impression.
