												I got this game as part of a bundle of bundles that were on sale. I think I paid around $.29 for it. I think I was ripped off even at that price.Gladiator Trainer is an utter mess in terms of interface, programming, and game play. A big part of this? A structural bug that I thought was actually part of the game ""working as intended"" that allows me to have every single warrior in my care fight for me in every battle I face. This title is a piece of drivel filled with aweful screen grabs created in Poser 2 and feels like a mediocre attempt to westernize a Japanese visual novel.I will likely get about 50% of the achievements since getting just one now means this title will mar my overall achievement score. But do not take hours played as an endorsement for this piece of garbage.			"

												Strangly addicting. I really thought I would hated this game after 5-6 of griding and watching automatic combat.But strangly I like it. The background music, The weird graphic, the cruel background world seems to fit all together perfectly in this not even clost to perfect game.A lot of level grinding needed as the end game enemy are in level 25-30 and they are really hard to defeat. Alot luck in involved in automatic combat and you will lose alot fight but it's somehow ok.You can use your pleasure slave to increase figher slaves's agility and hit point constantly. Do it on the high defense warriors would make make late game a lot easier.Not much of a story or main quest to do. Strangly cresent blade didn't drop for me after i complete that north tourney a couple times and I end up loading previous save game to get it. Probably a glitch happened.7/10.. Really not that great of a game but strangly addicting and recommend for people that got a lot time to waste on not so bad games.			"

												Personally, I enjoy this game. I am maybe half way through it I'm not sure. Ignore any of the pointless comments saying, it's NOT an amime rpg woooooaaaaahhhhh... Yeah, course it's not, it clearly shows it's not in the gameplay trailer top of this page. For what it is it's good. Only thing I wasn't sure about was when I changed one of my slaves weapons to 1 handed he wouldn't use his skill in battle, I put him back to 2 handed and vwalla worked again :) But apparently there is a book on slave fighters in the library so it might cover it in there, I don't know.Rpg elements - Level up and Upgrade your fighters weapons and armour by buying better equipment.Story - Again for what it is, not too bad. Sometimes funny, sometimes serioius and gives you choices.Graphics - It is what it is, I think all the graphics, screens, characters look perfectly fine. It's not a triple A game so don't get it then cry your eyes out complaining that the graphics are a million frame rate per second and in 3d and crap...Oh also, you buil a few things at your manor/land, to let you do a few more things with your fighters. And it's it's not overly complex. Overall I would probably give this game a 6 and a half out of 10.If you are into these kind of games rpg/battle simulation/management games, then give it a try,			"

												The game has potential but is still incomplete. There's surely room for more improvement. Visuals seem very old and they need to be polished. Also, an options menu should be added including the screen resolution adjustment. The user interface should be improved too. Other than that, the image used in cover is deceptive and has nothing to do with the game. I strongly suggest that the devs should remove it and use a convenient image instead. In short, this game might've been something very great but the devs missed the chance to do so.			"

												if the game was half as good as the trailer i would recomend it BUT its twice as worse, so i wont recomend this piece of garbage, if you want to buy this to give it as a prank to your friends then okay. I AM VERY SURE THEY WILL HATE IT!!!lets have a list of some negatives1.There is no animation for anything except fighting, the rest is images and options and when I am saying images, litterally its like the cut a persons picture wich was cartoonised and put it there a kid in the kidagarden would do better and then put some plain options to choose wich when you press on them everything except fights will have something like the same image with the same expression everywhere and options to choose1.5.Awful artwork 2. when i am saying that there exists animation in fighting i meant the shaking of the characters nothing else, same postures same everything, they dont even change expression when they are hit, dammn thats hardcore do they even feel pain, cause if they do i have no way to know.3. the story is very plain. YOU WANT REPUTATION! END OF THE STORY4.If you buy this for your friends then you wont be having any friends after this.I am going to keep this game to get the cards and all  i got it with a discount which is 0.49$ but even then its not worth that, believe me games like klabi have more work done on them than this.dont  buy this gameif even after all that you are still not convinced not to buy this game then go suffer for your self			"

Early Access Review
								Simple Team Management Simulation game,Well Drawn Characters,Takes patience and tactical plannings onwhich matches to accept on, winning or losing on purpose by forfeiting matches, grinding fighters, expanding home assets, profitting and arsenal gathering.The start is rather slow, as need to plan and choose what class of fighters, expansions and saving of capital.Do not rush to increase your reputation, or you will have trouble meeting easy matches to grind on as you will be promoted to stronger locations, choose to win first two matches and forfeit the last match to drop reputation, for long term profit.Expand to four slave cages and get pleasure slaves to train stamina as soon as possible.Keeping fighters happy will reap extra coins after a win.Occassional weekly random events may appear to spice things up.Save often, reloading before buying fighters from ship refreshes the class.Clunky controls when using keyboard controls, and little configuration settings ingame,wall of texts to skip,Bug with Tower fighters, whom repeats wasting turns casting defend up.Personally I go for Warrior, Shadow, Blade and Bear for my team.Game can easily be completed once you get a few slaves at lvl 23-25 with much pleasure slaves HP boosts and cross skillings, Blade, Bear or Warrior for final fight.Enjoyed the game so far,could really use more content, but according to news, the game ceased updating.Playable at a low price,Recommend to try.

Gladiator fighting and management would be a really fun game if done right but this is definatly NOT that game. Avoid like you would the dankest gladiator pit.			"

												For the RPG players who are looking for a low cost entertaining game who like ""building"":     The Positive:            Worth the low cost.  ($2.00... I believe I had it cheaper when it was on sale.)            The random scenario occurrences are interesting and break the monotony of the pattern of battle and building.            ""Real RPG aspect"":  The estate development makes you the ""driving character"".     On the fence:                 You do not control what your fighter does.  They fight how they want.  You try to equip them the best you can.       The Negative:            The interface can be annoying (mouse pointer vs keyboard).              Once an event is made, I do not believe it will repeat.  (i.e. Marriage scenario)            Your house manager constantly repeats things you don't care about later in the game (where is the fast forward                          button).  Also   She should get a new outfit as you advance.  Overall:  There are developer mechanical flaws.  However, for the price, this is an good game.   If it is on sale  (< $2.00) and you are a builder or RPG player.   I would definitely recommend it.			"

												For two dollars this is a great sim management game to waste time on. The sound is good, the game play is simple, and the management aspects of the game keep it fun to the end. And the game's storyline is at least interesting and yet short. There is enough variety in the classes to make consideration worthwhile and enough differing abilities to make each class unique. You really do get more than what you pay for if you like sim management games.On a note, there are reviews that touch on the image the game uses being an anime style image while not being an anime game. The game store page has 5 images and a video posted of what the game looks like. The devs do just fine informing people of what the game is and what it is about, regardless of what splash art they use for their 'gamecover.'			"

												It's simple and straightforward, delivers exactly what you'd expect from this level of a game. At the same time it's not one of those games you're going to come back to and play again. In just under 10 hours I managed to beat it and unlock all the achievemnets.For $1.99, I got my money's worth and I will also say this; there's a lot of potential for the developers to build and expand this game into something really worthwhile. If they do expand it, I might honestly consider dishing out some more cash for extra content worth the price.Fair warning, this game heavily relies on aspects of slavery and the slave trade. So if you're not comfortable with those kinds of things...			"

												Good idea, bad execution.You run a plot of land where you use slaves like pokemon, training them to fight for money.After playing 10 minutes, one slave ran away and was killed, the other got an injury that meant he couldn't fight for 6 weeks. You don't get to choose the battles you participate in, you just choose to fight in a random one or not; always outmatched.0$ Died poor. Not Fun.... Made new file, went well, still alive, is playable, if basically pokemon, but with slaves...Beat it, didn't get the achievement for beating it, it kills time, worth 3$ or less			"

												Surprisingly good game, reminds me of Dragon Force on the Saturn.For me, the mix of light management sim and rpg was very playable and entertaining from begining to the end.There are plenty of events to keep it interesting and a very respectable amount of content, like dialogues, lore, variety of classes, weapons, armor and skills.The NPCs are very varied and nicely made.The story was decent and interesting despite being quite basic, i wish it had more depth and character development of course, but its still better than some more expensive games out there.Lately its very rare that i finish the games i play/try because im quite jaded, but this one i played to the end and found it very enjoyable.

								Pretty unique game. I must admit when I first got it, I was expecting a less detailed, less challenging game. I was surprised as to the difficulty and learning curve it has.

I'd recommend it for most rpg fans who also like a bit of strategy to their games.			"

												This game is interesting. First, compared to other RPGMaker games I've seen, the graphics are amazing. As to gameplay, it too is different. Your main role is to gain slave fighters and train them up until they can become champions of the arena. That said, be careful, apparently their time as fighters is limited before they can buy their freedom. There are also events that happen from time-to-time.Now the combat in the arena matches is automatic. You have to hope RNG favors you enough to win (at least when close). Injuries can really mess things up. And then there is the small issue of your income. Depending on how many individuals you have hired, you can literally depend on the fights to keep you in the green.Also note: The same publisher has a game called Crown Champion: Legends of the Arena. Apparently, it is the sequel to this game.			"

												Gladiator Trainer is a fairly simple title if compared to some other more recent games, but that doesn't really seem to make much difference, because the style is very innovative and the gameplay itself can prove to be quite impressive. You start your journey with only a couple of slaves who happen to be inexperienced in combat and your goal is to build your reputation towards the top. To get there, you can develop buildings, hire staff, buy new slaves etc. Although the weekly routine is pretty much the same, the game can surely keep you hooked for a good amount of time. Either way, just like any other regular RPG, the closer you're about to finish, the lesser patience you have (grinding is grinding after all). Another thing that I didn't really like about it was the fact that although your gladiators can learn so many different skills, you rarely see any of them making use of anything. Overall, this game has a very attractive price and it's extremely fun so I recommend to anyone who's interested.			"

												As gladiator training sims go this one is about middle of the road, like most you do not directly control you're fighter, and the arenas get harder the longer you sucessfuly play.  The game feels a little bland after rank 9 or so but honestly for the price it is worth a play.My adivece to the dev if you guys do a sequel (and you realy should) add some kind of alternetive activity to arena fights after the first four ranks, best of luck I hope you make more games.

								For 1.59 10/10, 9 hours for 1.59 is good value and i found the storyline quite interesting. A lot of things could perhaps be worked on, for example you reach a threshold where you just do not use gold any more and the last 3 hours of the game i had the same 3 gladiators and 50000 gold and was basically just waiting for my reputation to catch up so i could fight Emeric.Based of of this game i am really looking forward to their next game, if they have built on this foundation then the game they have coming out in 2 weeks could be top notch.
