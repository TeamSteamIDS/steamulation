												I think the concept of this game is great. The idea is that it's an open world crime game like GTA, but it's set in video game land filled with parodies of almost any video game character you can imagine. It's a brilliant idea, and fortunately the game mostly lives up to this great concept even if it falls short in some areas.The game plays as you'd expect out of an open world crime game. However, the game tries to have a much better variety of mission styles. It doesn't try to be only standard A to B shooting. The game tries to mix it up by including missions that are arcade-like or based on old NES games. Thanks to this the variety is incredible and every other mission mixes up the gameplay in some way, so you'll rarely get bored. The quality of the missions do vary however. A good amount of the missions are fun and challenging, but others tend to be a little shallow and funnled, not leaving a lot of room for experimentation. On the whole though, the biggest problem with the missions in this game is that they're all a bit short.The pacing of the whole game is crazy fast, so it's a very quick experience and missions end quite fast sometimes. Unfortunately this leads to my biggest problem with the game; the main campaign is not very long. You can try to take it slow and try not to rush through, but the game is so fun you won't want to stop. It isn't criminally short though, it can last to about 6-7 hours. Just don't expect a 15-20 hour long campaign. The game offers a challenge and it gets really brutal at times. Don't get me wrong the game is not unbeatable, it's just some of the levels do not hold back on challenge, so there is a good amount of authentic NES-style difficulty. Expect to get a bit frustrated at times if you're not used to that kind of thing.The game has a pacing problem narrative-wise as well. It seems like the game was supposed to have a somewhat deep storyline and characters but that aspect seems to have been scrapped before the game's release. So as a result, if you were looking for an engaging story, you'll be disappointed. It's extremely fast paced, and has a lot of unrelated events and characters you see once or twice then never again, there's just no focus. That doesn't mean it's horrible though, since it manages to be entertain and the humor is mostly well done. The characters are also interesting and there's always something new and amusing around the corner. The parody aspect is extremely well done. Basically, the whole world of RCR is one big parody. The characters in it are cleverly de-branded counterparts of famous characters, and basically everything else is a reference to something from the 80's, the 90's, or sometimes the 2000's. The whole city you explore is chock full of parodies and pop-culture references, it's pretty fun to explore. However it's a little 'look but don't touch'. The city is just kind of....there. It's fun to look at, but it's not very interactive and you can't go into most of the buildings. The city is also a bit small as well which is a little disappointing, but understandable if there was not much dev time to spare or it couldn't be bigger due to the NES limitations, possibly both (yes, the game's engine has limitations very similar to the NES). The sprites are small as well which is kind of jarring in contrast with all the amazing pixel art in the game. They're not very detailed, but there is a zoom mode if you want them to be bigger. Just keep in mind that it doesn't make the sprites more detailed, it just makes them larger.The music in this game is composed by 3 different guys including the legendary ""virt"" (Jake Kaufman), and they each have their own style. The soundtrack in this game is very, very good. It sounds extremely authentic, so it's almost as if they were ripped out of an actual old NES game. The only problem I have with the music is that during cutscenes, it switches between songs in a weird way. Like one shot shows something and there's a song in the background,  then when it changes to a different shot showing something else, it switches to a entirely different song that's completely unrelated to the previous song that was playing, so the cutscenes sound a bit weird at times. Also I know an in-game radio like in GTA is probably hard to code, but in this game you don't get a feeling that it's playing songs on other stations without you. So sometimes, it sounds like it starts playing the same song every time you switch to a certain station.Overall though, RCR is a very fun and unique game combining all the pop culture from the 80's and 90's into one game, so the nostalgia due to the sheer amount of references gets pretty intense. Also, the game has a lot of variety and and some genuinely good humor, so you'll rarely get bored during the short but sweet campaign. The game may have not truly lived up to it's great concept, but it was pretty damn close. I think there is a lot of potential for this concept, with just a few tweaks, a sequel to this game could possibly be one of the best indie games ever.EDIT: After some rethinking, I've decided to recommend this game. You have to keep in mind that I waited quite a while for this game, and it didn't live up to the extreme expectations I had, so I set myself up for disappointment. So at first it was more of a personal review instead of an objective one. So I changed it to be more objective and recommended the game. The game still has some hefty flaws, but it's still a fun romp no doubt.			"

												It’s like Grand Theft Auto in an 8-bit simulator. Retro City Rampage is the incarnation of the 80s and 90s. Also the sound effects and music make you totally feel the 80s. This game is a MUST-HAVE for all those who grew up with such games and want to relive the old times. Through, if you’re one of the new age-kids where graphics are everything, you might want to pass.Once you made it through the handful of training missions, the game opens up substantially, and you can keep both: the comedy and the action rolling at your own pace. Some of the comic moments are so thick that it can at first feel oppressive. Nobody will laugh at everything, BUT everybody will laugh at SOMETHING in this game!Of course you can keep attention to all missions but the most of your fun will consist of freeroaming the city and just raising hell! It’s easy to spend hours with it because the game always offers enough to keep you busy. For example whenever you start to kill people (with driving, shooting, punching or otherwise) the police will follow you and you get the feeling of a gangster on escape.I highly recommend this game. ♥			"

												Decent gameplay, the main reason to bother with it is for all the crazy 80's and early 90's references. There are a few internet meme's strewn throughout and it's all very welcome in my books.The retro game references are just superb though, with an entire section dedicated to the original TMNT NES cartridge among others, it's a blast to just experience the game as a whole.The game had a lot of love put in to it, the music is incredible and I had to download the soundtrack afterwards and I still listen to it every once in a while.Definitely worth a sale price purchase in the 10 to 15 dollar range.I can't say much about the controls as it basically plays like a slightly better version of the original top view GTA games (1 & 2) mixed with an 8-bit NES style. The map can get a bit convoluted and collectables are a bit annoying to find even with a guide because of the shoddy graphics but it's still do-able with some focus.The thing is you'll either love it or hate it... and if the references can't save you because you're too young to understand it, then you should probably stay away because it's all about the references, not so much about the gameplay.

												IfI had to recommend a great retro style game. This would be the one. It's like GTA 1 game married the references/pop culture of the 80's and 90's (and yes some other newer games too)! If you love the 80's and 90's you will find this game worth while giving a playthrough. With all it's 8-bit glory. Heck they have free-play mode where you have nothing to do but do what you want in this open world. Customizing the game look also is pretty radical! Be the way cool cat and get this game if you don't already have it.			"

												Retro City Rampage is a wonderful homage to all things 80's.  Expect references to 80's movies, games, pop culture, and much more.  The gameplay itself is like a 2D, 8-bit version of the 3D Grand Theft Auto games, split between on foot combat, and vehicle segements.  There are 62 story missions, 23 weapons, and tons of vehicles.  The game has a pretty good difficulty curve starting very easy and building up to extremely difficult for the final sequence of story missions. The game is very generous with checkpoints so dying is almost never that big of a deal.  Aside from the main story there are 14 ""sprees"" and 23 ""second rate sprees"".  The sprees involve trying to get a high score while under various effects such as drunkeness, invulnerablity, explosive sweat, normal stuff.  There is one second rate spree for each weapon and they just involve killing as many people with that weapon as possible.   There are also 70 collectibles hidden around the game world (similar to the packages, magnets, oysters, etc. from the GTA games) along with plenty of other hidden easter-eggs giving plenty of reason to explore the game's overworld.  Overall the game was very fun, very funny, and highly recommended by me.			"

												Retro City Rampage mixes a lot of old school ideas together for a nostalgic experience that is easy to enjoy, but best captured in small doses. I tried the campaign story for several hours, but I found being an errand boy started to get repetitiously boring. That's not to say I wasn't having fun, rather having fun in moderation.The stuff I enjoyed the most were the side missions where I got to go off on wild rampages with various weapons, although after about 5-10 minutes, I found myself looking for something else to do.It's definitely a fun way to escape from reality. Plus there's something about scoring points for running people over that never gets old.			"

												Ok, for some reason, my long review auto deleted itself, so ill redo what i can do it again.This game was gifted to me from a friend. It is quite fun, but newer gamers and millenials might not understand things in this game as they are parodies from the 1980's and upwards. Also, people who only care about graphics will not like this game either, due to the older look of the graphics in this. I really enjoyed this title.Anyways, this game was quite fun to play and i recommend it to all my friends for retro gaming and funny game playing.			"

""EVENNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! WE PRESNT TO YOU TONIGHT, A CLICHE BANK ROBBERY!References has always been the part of every sector of the entertaintment industry. Musicians puts hate or love to their lyrics, as the reference to someone or something, most of times, it has affected them. Directors and screenwrites puts to their movies references of another famous movies or people affected movie industry. And so, game developers trying to put references of games, poeple who are/was or affected gaming industry. And sometimes, we can find developers from diamonds, who puts references of all kinds, into their game - Vblank Entertaintment. These guys made out of nothing something and that's Retro City Rampage (RCR) - little indie game, which contains more references, that megabytes that game has.Most epic adventure for those, who was born before 1990, and biggest nightmare, and ""Lost World"" for those who wasn't. RCR be like - A-Team GMC van gonna run over you. Green pipes from Mario are everywhere. Brown Dog from my childhood is everywhere. First mission and first reference totally blew me away. School bus runs through the wall of the bank, to stole looted money alias the Batman. And so, almost every minute, you'll find something, from your childhood, or not only.Difficulty and game-design of this game is just tribute to good old video-game machines - tough difficulty, dozens of secrets,  score multipliers, memorable characters, unblockable characters, crazy weapons, aliens and sh*t. If you looking for nostalgia, and wants to go back to your childhood, go for indies, Playstation 1/2 or Retro City Rampage.Salute to you Vblank.PS: Main parallel of the game is Back to Future movie from 1985.PS2: Between the writing of this review and this update, the game has been updated to DX version which is another thumbs up.Bonus Point: There is nothing wrong with this game for realRating: 9/10 "

												If you like retro games, parodys, and GTA, then this is the game for you. This is the first time in a while, where i would just run around, instead of doing the missons. This is a plain and simple fun, and funny game. I have only spent a few hours in it so far, and im just having so much fun. The retro 8 bit look is nice, the controls are simple, and it has full controller support.  This is the type of game that you can play for 5 mins or and hour. While i bought it on sale, this game is worth the cost, if you like open world sandbox type games. If your thinking about picking it up, stop thinking and just get it.			"

												This game is a NES nostalgic dream. It isn't however, an NES game (just to make that clear)! It is a spoof of every game possible and it does a good job of synthesizing it together. Just get ready for both good and bad (lame) jokes.The storyline follows a person named ""The Player"" in which he is essentially a thug for hire. A bank heist goes wrong and The Player ends up stealing a time machine which flings him years forward. Doc Choc (another spinoff of a well known persona) comes in to help The Player recover pieces of the machine to get him back to where he belongs.The gameplay is like the first version of GTA. You are able to move in 9 directions and shoot relatively to your position. Weapons are in abundance and in variety from golf clubs to shotguns to the bionic commando arm. Why is there? Why not... why not. There will be situations where you will need specific weapons to accomplish certain tasks. I prefer to use the shotgun over automatics when it comes to being overwhelmed by a lot of characters. The player can choose to free-roam the city or do main missions or side-quests. The game is really over-the-top with everything it does and isn't scared to loosely knock off and ridicule other games. Any car (or bicycle or motorcycle) can be stolen. Some cars can be modified to be given a jet engine at the back or some kind of armaments. The more you progress in the game, more modifiers become available. If you do happen to break the law, cops will chase you if you break but it isn't as tedious as the GTA series. To get the police off your back, the player needs to find a special police token that will rid them of their wanted level. This token appears randomly in areas or can be dropped by eliminating a certain amount of police forces. In addition to modding cars, the player may mod themselves as they please. Again, progressing through the story will unlock more styles. There isn't much the player can change but hair is definitely one of them as cut-scenes will show ""The Players"" face. Throughout the game, there are power-ups that can be picked up to give the Player some neat abilities. These abilities can come in the form of speed or in some obscene form such as a Super Mario cape allowing your character to fly.The graphics are quite basic and provide basic 8-bit fun. If graphics are imperative to you, this might bug you. Although the graphics are simplistic, it seems that the smallest of details were paid attention to. Sure, it is a simple color with a simple outline but the thought of including as much as one can is appreciated. The sounds follow a NES scheme. The music station can be changed (there are about 10 stations to choose from) and the sounds are appropriate for the setting. Don't expect to hear triple A explosions but you'll definitely hear everything going on in the game.I like this game. I personally bought it on it's lowest sale price and do find the price slightly steep. If you do like this though it might be worth the purchase for you. It's good, it entertains, but doesn't try to attempt to break away from traditional gaming. I would have loved to see the game take a bit more risks with it's gameplay.RATING : 7.25/10.  Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots : The bosses or enemies look vaguely familiar.... Casually strolling through the streets with a rocket launcher... feels like GTA 1  An example of in-game humor. I like when games poke fun of life  The game likes to play puns off other games. Here is a Metal Gear spoof Next level design and story When it came time to talk about Devs "

I wish I hadn't done that. :(DX stuff:+ The new cop system is GREAT! One of the most annoying things was constantly getting the cops on me accidently and     having to sit around in a store till it passes. now you just kill them off the screen.+ The new overlay is nice.+ Scoreboards!+ You can mark waypoints on your map now.

												This game might honestly be one of my favorite games ever. There's a lot of fun to be had here, and the number of good things immensely outweighs the bad.Pros:-Awesome visuals.-Fantastic soundtrack.-Absurd yet hilarious dialogue.-A large open world to explore with lots of neat places to visit.-A fun story mode with fun yet challenging side missions.-Tons of customizable visual filters to spruce up the viewing experience.-Loads of references to video game and moie characters of times past.-Minigames inside of a game. Always welcomed.Cons:-The core gameplay finds itself to be a little bit repetitive, but it's still fun nonetheless. This game just a blast and, like I said earlier, one of my favorite games of all time. It's loaded with charm and obvious care from the developer. It's SO worth paying the full price for, you won't regret it. 10/10.			"

												Think 8-bit GTA1/2 meets the ridiculousness of Saint's Row 3 paired with a HUGE amount of videogame and movie references. If you can't relate to that, think GTA1/2: Blood Dragon. True to it's old school nature, It's everything you can expect and more from a top down homage to nes gaming.It has a neat little story mode with millions of references, arcade challenge mode where you can do fun weapon or kill challenges of the sort, and a free roam mode where you can create mayhem as you please. There are even arcade machines you can play within the game as fun little minigames. Also included, are tons of skins for the game. The controls for aiming can get a bit of getting used to but it is far from a deal breaker.This game is a must have for any old school gamers.			"

												Retro City Rampage. What can I say? I love this game. I can’t even write from an objective standpoint here to make an honest and fair review with this one. I’ve spent over 20 hours with this game here on steam, gotten every achievement- and even then- I didn’t quit. I took the time to Gold Medal all the optional missions too. I seriously can’t get enough. I tried for hours to put my name up on the leaderboards. I’m in the top 20 for lots of the missions and I’m quite proud of that. But enough about me.Since I can’t really come at this from an unbiased angle I’ll just try to explain what’s it like. It's a retro-inspired Grand Theft Auto-esque homage to everything that was popular before I was born- and I can definitely respect that. I grew up watching movies and playing the games of the 80s- even though I was born in '95- just because of the way my parents were. It’s a top down shooter in some ways- a bit like Smash T.V. (a game which is actually referenced in a rather obvious level) The game is indeed open world- and has the very same mission based structure you’d come to expect from an open world experience. The cars in it drive in a couple different ways. One is akin to an RC car (a bit like R.C. Pro-A.M) and the other is one of those “Drive in the direction you press” things. Oddly- I usually prefer the latter- but mostly because I find it more precise. The story is goofy and out there- but fitting for the game. And there’s even a few cameos of a few other popular indie games.This is the kind of game that you might be skeptical of when you see it in action- but when you actually play it you’ll see what makes it appealing- surely. Whether or not you’ll like it is entirely subjective in this case- but if you have an interest in retro games or games that resemble the kind of gameplay you find in Grand Theft Auto- you’ll at the very least get a kick out of it. If you grew up in the 80’s with the games and movies of that decade- I’d almost universally recommend it.I can’t imagine a situation where someone will buy this game and feel entirely disappointed. I’d imagine you’d want to pick it up during a sale- as with most things on steam- but I feel the game is entirely worth the full price. Especially if you want to support the developer- who’s a pretty awesome guy by the way. I can’t wait to see what Brian Provinciano has up his sleeves for the future.			"

												I haven't played this game. I only played for the minimum of 5 minutes so Steam would allow me to write a review. I've bought it because I saw two videos from its creator explaining how he managed to port this game to NES and 486DX and also compress all its assets to fit to a 1.44 floppy disk. I wanted to find a way to donate my money to him, so ladies would find him more attractive, thus raising his chances of having offsprings. Our world would benefit greatly from his genius offsprings.

												Retro City Rampage (DX) is a 8-bit GTA but alot more over the top with tons of 80's and early 90's pop-culture references. For example references to Paperboy, Mario, Metal Gear Solid and alot more. The main story of Retro City Rampage is on the short side and will probably take you around 6-8 hours. Luckely there's enough content to keep you entertained after you're done with the main missions.The main missions are quite versatile, and the game has a great sence of humor. The city of Theftopolis you play in has a decent size with a good amount of content next to the main missions. For example things like: side missions, customization, buying weapons and gadgets, going to the arcade to play games and more. The sound in this game is a joy to listen to and the controls in this game are great and well designed. This game is definitely underrated and deserves alot more attention. It's great, over the top, has some really cool pop-culture references and great humor. I highly recommend it.			"

												I like the story and artstyle of this game (which reminds me of many NES/SNES games). I really like how it parodies many games and films like Back to the future, Super Mario Bros 2 and Bionic commando and how it uses these ganres to produce humour. The key bindings fit the game perfectly and allows the player to easily control the character.Overall, the game is probably better than the first installments of GTA.9/10			"

												Take GTA and make it 8-bit and silly as hell!Graphics:Retro fans will drool over the 8-bit look of the game, which is nice to look at.  Lots of vibrant colors and detailed areas to enjoy.  And the cutscenes are well drawn and fit the feel of the game.  Nothing much to complain about here.Sound:8-bit sounds all the way!  From the sirens and gunsfire to the music, it's all 8-bit bliss.  Much of the music is also nice to listen to, but you have the option to shut it off it it's not your thing.  The game also has options for different filters and boarders to make it feel like you're playing it on an old tv back in the day, scanlines and all.  Some of the colors filters, while nice options, can hurt the eyes after a bit.Control:You can use keyboard/mouse or controller, but controller is HIGHLY reccomended.  Controls are a bit of an issue, as the default keybinds feel weird and rebinding them is dificult.  Once you get past that though, the game plays fine and control is responsive.Gameplay:This games, despite the cartoony look, retro graphics, and hilarious story, is still a GTA clone at heart.   You can mug people on the strees, collect weapons and carjack people.  There are paint shops and pickups to lose the heat, and shops to buy skins and weapons.  But you also get a few tricks that GTA doesn't, like speed boots, the ability to jump on enemies, add weapons to your cars, and even a time machine!  The wackiness really sets this game apart from GTA!  The story is also a full on omage to old retro games!  The game's missions doubly so!  You even have to go visit an imfamous dam from a certain turtles game!  The only issue I have is that some of the missions are QUITE long and due to random difficulty spikes, will often take more than an hour to complete, and repsawns during the mission are unforgiving.  I have ragequitted a few times because of this.  Still, this fact does not limit the overall fun factor of the game.I recommend this game to anyone who has or had enjoyed a GTA game, but want something more light-hearted and crazy!			"

												I wish i could say i like this game. I really, really do. But it just has massive glaring flaws, that keep it from actually being fun to play. When the game starts, it's funny. The intro manages to both parody AND lampshade the Megaman 2 intro, and pretty much 90% of the intro level is a parody of the beginning of The Dark Knight Rises, and a well done one at that. Then you step into the gameplay, and it's actually fun. Yeah, it can be tedious at times, but it IS fun. Then, after about the third mission, the problems start.The first one is honestly one of the bigger problems: The game doesn't understand when there's been ENOUGH refrences. You can't go two seconds without a reference, and while it's fine at first, by the end of it, it's gotten EXTREMELY annoying. The second one is more of a deterrent to the experience: The random gameplay changes are not implemented well. Why is the final battle a chase with crappy hit detection? Why do you have to run over people in a car that might as well be made of paper? Why do you have to stealth with stealth mechanics that DON'T WORK?!?!?And finally, the game seems to expect you to be perfect in the later stages. Narrow hallways with enemies with rocket launchers that can kill you in one hit if you don't have a full lifebar? Check. Throwing 15+ of said enemies at you in one room? Check. Massive Zerg Rushes of Enemies with guns when all you've been given is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ melee weapon?MASSIVE ♥♥♥♥ING CHECK.All in all, this is one of those games that, while i'm glad i bought it, if only to learn about it, i honestly would've been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if i had bought it at full price. It's not nearly as good as the trailers make it out to be. I'd reccomend leaving it be.			"

The Story Stages are increasing in difficulty, with a decent plot. I bought this from HRK Games for $1.95, and SO worth it.

												Retro City Rampage is pretty much what I'd hold up as the ideal that all indie games should aspire to be like. Some parts are much better than others, but most of it is really awesome.The one major drawback I see with it is it's free roam mode. This mode feels limited in what you can do. You can do things to get money but there's ultimately nothing to buy. Structuring this mode a little differently could have made it more engaging.			"

												Retro City Rampage (DX) is essentially a reference-packed trimmed down version of the original GTA games that manages to keep a lot of the original gameplay along with a few other bells and whistles. In it, you take on the role of “PLAYER”, a greaser caricature from the 1950s who has a lust for wanton destruction. Inevitably you are wrapped up in a plot to save the world from evil via completing random fetch quests and other minutia, even though you’re really just doing it to wreak havoc.RCR is more of a linear game pretending to be an open world game to the point where I almost wished it was just a linear game. The world map serves almost entirely as a vector to get you from one plot point to the next and typically you will end up with an option list of “do optional quest” or “do main quest”. To be fair, this is mostly done for parody’s sake and the game doesn’t really take the whole open world concept very seriously (at one point randomly teleporting the character to save time). There are a few minigames and challenges to keep things interesting in case you decide to wander off the main plot-line and some of them can be pretty tough. The game eventually does force you into a few very demanding action sequences as part of the main questline but with a little perseverance, and a bit of hatred for water levels, you should be able to make it through just fine. Pick this one up when you’re feeling the need to scratch that retro-gaming itch.			"

												Retro City Rampage is what you get when you combine a modern open world game with retro 8 bit gameplay and style. Oh, and with loads of pop culture and video game references. This combination of different gameplay and style works well, playing out like an 8 bit version of GTA and similar games with plenty of humor and parodies going on.The story revolves around Player, the main character of the game, who is a henchman. After stealing a time traveling phone booth that takes him into the year 20XX, Player must work with Doc Choc to fix the time machine and also interact with other characters in Theftopolis to get the needed parts. In the game, the story is driven through missions and cutscenes. Along with the main missions for the story are optional side missions that provide extra narrative based on the main plot.The game uses a lot of parodies and references throughout as seen with the characters and scenery, to name a few. With the sheer amount of references going left and right, it’s easy to be overwhelmed, but the parodies are a good laugh with a focus on video games and 80s and 90s pop culture. The references range from mainstream to obscure and subtle to blunt, and it’s a great experience keeping with the game’s theme and setting. The majority of the references lie in Story Mode, which really drives not just the parodies but also the overall style of the game.Retro City Rampage plays much like a cross between open world games like Grand Theft Auto with some gameplay style from NES games. Like in most open world games, there is a big city to explore and missions pointing you to certain locations. The majority of missions focus on getting to a certain spot on the map and doing a certain task. There’s a great variety of different tasks to do, making the Story Mode missions interesting with different gameplay goals to complete. In addition to the structured missions that show each objective to be done, there are also arcade style missions with the goal being to get a high score. These arcade missions are quite fun in their own right, focusing instead on pure mayhem and causing as much destruction in the city.As the gameplay borrows from GTA, there are some common elements in Retro City Rampage. Cars can be stolen, pedestrians can be attacked, police will attack upon seeing a crime, and there are a variety of weapons to use.  The game does deviate from typical open world games by bringing its own twist based on games from the 8 bit era. Jumping is performed like in platforming games with the intent to jump over obstacles and to jump on people’s heads. This jump attack can kill people and is a powerful unarmed attack. Objects and people can be picked up and thrown in a manner similar to beat em up games, where any object is carried over the head and thrown forward. Powerups can bestow different effects. These powerups must be bought unless a mission gives one that must be used, and they give a huge amount of power in a limited time.In addition, the game is quite fair when it comes to trying to complete missions. After dying in a mission a few times, the game will offer some useful tips pertaining to that mission. If the game feels that the mission is quite tough for the person playing based on the many deaths that occurred, the game may change things around by giving a handicap to help complete the mission. This function of making the missions a tad bit easier is not in every mission, so some particularly tough missions must be completed at the default difficulty. Anyhow, it’s clear to see the inspiration from open world games, but there’s also a great combination with gameplay from NES games that works well as a game that is fun to play.This game employs an 8 bit pixel style, with a very sincere approach in imitating the style of actual games from that era. The graphics are quite blocky and low resolution in the overworld, as if the game were on the NES. Character portraits are also similar in style, along with capturing the original character or person’s features from the parody. Only a few modern graphical liberties are used, one of which is the wavy screen distortion effect. In addition to its 8 bit style, there are various screen borders that slightly affect the presentation of the game, either by placing high resolution graphical borders that fit the game’s theme to even changing the colors of the game. With the 8 bit NES art style, the game treats the graphics quite well. It’s the same way that the parodies are treated with respect toward the original material, and the game goes great lengths into accurately portraying visuals as if it were an actual NES game with great results.The music in the soundtrack is chiptune like the style of the game. There are some nice tunes played throughout, with the soundtrack being done by various video game musicians. Each of the songs work very well with the tone and style of the game, with a few parodies too based on some popular NES tunes. Overall, the soundtrack is quite catchy and stays true to the general theme quite well.Of note is the sound design, which is done like the sounds of the NES. All the sounds are not realistic and instead go for the beepy electronic noises that were a mainstay of games in the 80s. This design choice perfectly matches what the game was going for, with almost every aspect of the game being lifted from an NES game from its original time. There are only a few unique things seen in modern games that this game uses, but Retro City Rampage does so well in staying true to the original retro video game style.Retro City Rampage is in essence, an 8 bit version of open world games like GTA with lots of parodies here and there. The story is quite straightforward with the majority of parodies going there for a good laugh. The gameplay draws from GTA the most but throws in some gameplay style from NES games too. To top it off, both the art and music stay close to the style of the NES and holds its origins in high regard. Retro City Rampage is a fun game to play and oozes with respect for retro video games.

												Retro City Rampage is fantastic. The gameplay is simple and addictive, with high replay value.The game is nearly 100% a reference/parody of the 80's (including Back to the Future, Ghostbusters and TMNT) or popular NES games at any time (including Mario, Mega Man, and Rad Racer). It's very charming and doesn't take itself too seriously.One of the coolest features is the graphical options. You can change your ""television"" to several different sets, including an arcade cabinet or a Gameboy. You can also change the color settings to look like an NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis, Atari 2600, Gameboy, and many more. You can even turn on scan-lines for an authentic 80's CRT TV experience.My only gripes with this game are particular levels. The underwater levels are overly difficult and frustrating.Another level pits you against several rocket launcher-wielding goons with little to fight back with; defeating them is pure dumb luck.The final boss fight is initially interesting and stylish, but quickly becomes overly difficult and unfair. Other than these few issues, the game is incredibly fun and I would reccomend it to anyone.8/10			"

												(Of course, this review will be downvoted because it doesn't agree with the general consensus. Good.)Retro City Rampage is a pretty straight forward title. It's retro, takes place in a city, and you rampage. This is the game, a majority of the game. Visually, the game hits the mark spot on, colors and and sound design truly do evoke the right feeling. The missions aren't particularly fun, mainly consisting of ""A to B while C, then return to A"", or ""Fill Quota of X"" missions. It's an open world, and you can drive. The primary issue with this game is it relies almost entirely on trying to tickle the nostalgia part of your brain and reference things from the 80's. Do you like that? If you do, you might like this game. And in fact, some of the jokes and pokes are humorous, but it feels oversaturated. There's nothing wrong with being an 8-bit style game. But in Retro City Rampage, when you strip away the cheesy reference humor and the old school aesthetic, I feel that you'll find that there's not much worthwhile beyond that.			"

												This game I already had purchased when it was originally released for XBLA. I had so much fun with it, that I thought I would buy it again when it went on sale for Steam(and all of the udpates that are included) This game is a throwback to the ""good ol days"" of NES. From the creator of the NES rom homebrew ""Rom City Rampage"" He took the idea for the Rom Homebrew ""Rom City Rampage"" and built on it ten fold...The result is a HUGE sandbox retro styled 8 bit GTA type game. The gameplay is solid and the ENTIRE game is filled with all sorts of great 80's and 90's pop culture references/parodies. Movies, TV, Video games. You name it. Heck, in the opening gameplay/tutorial there are at least 10 great video game references that most gamers will recognize right away. They come fast, so keep your eyes peeled!This game has COUNTLESS HOURS of great gameplay. There are plenty of side missions, minigames, and badge/high score runs that you will never get bored. That doesn't even include the storyline missions that are required to ""beat"" the game. Tons of vehicles, enemies and ""outfits"" for you to mess around with. I am impressed with how perfectly the developer made the game play and feel like an 8 bit game, yet made sure that the game plays flawlessly. If you are a fan of GTA, retro games or just fun 80's and 90's pop culture I HIGHLY recommend you purchasing this game. There's NO excuse no to. It's worth every penny.			"

												Wow, what an awesome tribute to the 80's (and early 90's) this game is. It's basically GTA, NES style. The controls are well done, and causing havoc around the city is fun, but the crazy references to everything awesome about the late 80's, the 90's, and beyond are amazing. The plot makes no sense, but that's OK since you get to ride Donkey Kong, hijack the TMNT van, join the Ghost Busters, guest star in Saved by the Bell, and drive the Delorean from Back to the Future, among other stuff. If that sounds awesome, you should try it. It is awesome.			"

												This game techinically takes only a few hours to beat. However, the proper way to play is not simply to beat the game here. Nay, the true goal is to take as much tiime between missions as possible, thus increasing the playtime by at least twofold. That being said, other than the actual arcade-style games-within-a-game, the only game I've been able to come up with for this is ""See How Long You Can Survive the Police"". The story missions are quite enjoyable and provide the variety I cannot, although there really should have been more of them (especially the non-story missions). The endgame somehow manages to take away both the titular city and rampage, instead opting to throw in a tonne of combat. And then you reach the final boss. While I personally found it a pain to beat, I can only imagine the difficulty one would have with it if they hadn't played one of the aformentioned games-within-a-game. Have fun if you miss one of your incredibly specifically-timed attack opportunities!In short Retro City Rampage is a fun game, as long as you don't put too much effort into beating it. It's fun, but doesn't have too much depth.7/10			"

												Take me down to murder and mayhem city.. where the 80's are alive and the girls are all.. 8 bitty...Saints Row 2-4 and GTA: Vice City have nothing on this game when it comes to paying homage to the 80's and murder and mayhem, but they do have better graphics, better soundtracks, and far more t&a but who needs t&a when you can kill the Turtles, the A-Team, and the Hoff? At least I think I ran over the Hoff. This game is just everything I wanted in a NES game in the 80's but never got, and I love the 80's.In short, if you're a child of the 80's and you aren't a graphics junkie and can appreciate 8 bit.. graphics', this game is calling your name.... really.. really loudly. And its dirt cheap so it isn't like you'll have buyers remorse even if you don't care for it.Did I mention it runs under Dos, Windows, and that your cat can play it?			"

												Retro City Rampage is a better technical achievement and a transplant of retro gaming than it is as an actual game. I'm impressed that something like this is able to have a lot of variety and not end up really collapsing in on itself. The mechanics themselves are not perfect but okay, doing that thing where misguided nostalgia brings back terrible gameplay elements and mechanics instead of doing the right thing and leaving them in the attic.The references ground my gears more than the gameplay. The combined weight of all the references and cameos is like Neil Cicierega having a stroke and turning the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny from a five minute song into a ten hour long old-style Greek epic. And when that isn't irritating enough, it brings out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ self-parodies of other games!The real recommendation here is the developer. Brian Proviciano is a Carmack level magician who fiddles around with ancient hardware and creates 100%-hardware accurate ports of this game in Assembly. The game itself accomodates to every level and flavor of nostalgia. You can even play the game in EGA or on a simulated Game Boy screen, for crying out loud! You can even play the aformentioned NES port of this game inside the actual game! That's bonkers as hell. Brian needs his John Romero to make the most of his talents and create something truly amazing.			"

The gameplay is pretty rough and has a pretty evil scale in terms of difficulty but can be satisfying.

												While this isn't a game that's based on an 80's franchise, I still highly recommend it to 80's retro junkies.  There are so many 80's elements in this game and while the game pays homage to those 80's franchises, its done in a parody like way.  The TMNT parody stuff is highly amusing, and then the A-Tem show up, and you'll come across the Burton verison of Batman which at the same time pays homage to the old campy tv series, and there are even some 90's elements like the moments where the game mocks Saved by the Bell.  As for the main bad guy, the developer seemed to base him off the corrupt boss in Warrant's old music videos from their Dirty Rotten era.  But like I said, there are a lot of 80's elements and Back to the Future is one o fthe big ones.In short, this game has retro NES graphics, and plays like one of the original GTA games but is chock full of 80's and some 90's satire and tht makes it totally worth getting if one is an 80's/90's junkie.  Th elead character, despite being an 8 bit character, is also pretty amusing.In short, I highly recommend this game to my fellow gen x'ers who grew up watching all of those 80's films and are into violent games that are violent in an amusing way.

												Prositives:* More 80's refrences than any peice of media constructed in the past 20 years, brillliantly weaved together.* Good NES music, thats available digitally and on limited vinyll.* Comes with a in-game instruction manual that's just a joke.* Free roam, with an emphasis on killing sprees. Basically, what GTA is built for.* Chris Hoffman himself is a cosmetic in this game.* A emphasis on retro graphics and style-you can even change the TV border (or turn it off)* DX mode makes it easier than what you've heard (and is toggleable)...Connatatives:*...but it's still hard. Expect a lot of deaths and some frustrating levels.* Once you finish the story, you're really only left with Leaderboarded-Challanges and Collectibles* The story is about 16 hours. A little lackluster.* If you're not familiar or from the 80s, the game's humor won't make any sense.SUMMARY:     A radical jet-fueled love-letter to all things from modern gaming's birth, It's a satisfying yet challenging game for those who's hearts and minds are still with their NES. Anyone else, though, may simply be too young to get it.			"

												When I picked this game up I honestly didn't expect it to be all that mind-boggling, but my mind was boggled almost immediately. A lot of other games in the same style tend to simply have pixellated graphics and vintage sounding chiptune music, leaving them feeling far less authentic than I'd like.This game does it's very damn hardest to make it feel as real as possible and it does a hell of a job at it. It even allows you to play the unfinished prototype of the game that was actually developed to play on the NES. The music in the game is out of this world in how great and accurate to the era it is.The story is fun to say the least and I found the humor to be very amusing. The gameplay is incredibly smooth and the controls are very easy to handle, especially when using a suitable controller.

Heavily resembling an earlier 8-bit game-hence the name-, Retro City Rampage DX is an open-world top-down self-aware adventure filled with popular culture references from the 1980s. The player takes the roll of a character name Player who resembles a greaser ‘cool kid’ from its said zone of reference. With heavy influence from the Destructoid crew (back when Jim Sterling was involved), this game features an abundance of weapon types, game and player modifications, and humorous themes. Apart from the content I would like to feature in the exposition of this review, a very noteworthy act by the creators of Retro City Rampage was the free update involving the Director’s Cut (DX) edition, which was supplemented to each other platform as well as Steam.Here are just a few reasons to give this game a try:Open World - Similar to the first two Grand Theft Auto titles, Retro City Rampage DX utilizes a top-down open-world approach, which permits the exploration of the vast overworld on foot or with one of the game’s many unique vehicles. Within this sandbox are varying side missions, shops, secrets (featured later), a primary story arch, and non-player characters which stride throughout the area with their own agendas. Seeing as though the Player can wreak havoc in many different ways with both a large inventory of weapons and objects as well as utilizing vehicle collisions, police pursue the same principles as they would in early Grand Theft Auto titles: kill the Player. Apart from this perspective, the actual missions within the world are quite enjoyable; the primary quest-line advances the story and side quests typically give the Player access to unique equipment, vehicles, and services.Free Roaming Mode - When the Player wishes to experience the sandbox action to Retro City Rampage DX without having to focus on missions appearing on the mini-map and the loss of money as a death penalty, Free Roaming mode is always available from the Main Menu. Though some of the features are not accessible as they would be through the main game-such as completing various missions-, Free Roam spawns the Player with nearly every weapon available and practically pats you on the head while saying, “Go have fun!” There is absolutely not penalty for death-with a life tracker humorously tracing the Player’s deaths in the negatives-but the same overworld ‘police chase you if you do something bad’ theme still applies.Humor - Retro City Rampage DX features references mostly from 1980s popular culture such as Yoshi from the Super Mario Brothers and pop icon Michael Jackson, and presents these fairly bluntly throughout the territory. One instance would be a useable Warp Pipe-originally seen in the Super Mario Brothers franchise-which takes the Player to a run-down sewer system that presents themes from other titles such as Pitfall. Somewhat subtle remark placements, however, can be viewed in the game, though it does help to know or have heard of at least some icons from the 1980s to understand these.Secrets - I prefer to allow Players to delve into this item on their own terms, but Retro City Rampage DX retains its 1980s gaming feel by packing secrets all over the map, with both simple and complex means in which to attain and discover them. There is an array of enjoyable hidden content within this game, from unlockable Player skins to special objects. Keep an eye out! My word of advice: write down those codes; you will know what I mean.TL:DR - Though simple, Retro City Rampage DX is a highly enjoyable title that melds traditional themes with a ton of awesome gameplay mechanics. I do apologize for not writing much about this game in comparison to other titles, but I must admit that this one is one of my favorites regardless. I highly recommend giving this game a try; this is not a high-budget AA title, but its charm alone is what makes this game so engaging, with gameplay that entices the Player to continue the trek.

												Retro City Rampage's gameplay, setting and style are summarised by the title. You're in a city, it's based on various old games and the objective is mainly to murder anyone onscreen. It is a parody of the 80's in general, with references to old games, films and pop stars in abundance. The game may get repetitive after a while, but with the astounding amount of content and fantastic references, it will take a while. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.			"

												The game starts out well touches a lot of good old gaming memories....but then by the end it just starts to copy the worst things you dont want to have in your game and becomes just die->reload->die missions no fun , no meaning. Left a bad taste by the end , would not want to play this game again :X Proceed at your own risk....Music is good, a controller is highly recommended why cant we have the the good parts from the retro old games instead of the annoying ones....Scorewise i would say 7/10My screenshots showing how the game goes from nice nostalgia to Pure rage[spoilers]http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidsnakehpks/screenshots/?appid=204630&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=grid#scrollTop=0Hoping for a pure story in the next game they make using a similar retro style			"

												I've been looking forward to Retro City Rampage for quite some time now. And now that it's been released I'm actually disappointed. Not because I enjoyed it so much, but because of the difficulty spikes that took away a lot of my enjoyment. The graphics look sweet , there's a lot of passion in it. It's visible from the start. I also enjoyed the references to 80's games, shows and movies. All great stuff.Same goes for the music and sounds, nothing to complain here.The missions, however, are a different story. Like any other game it starts off easy. Then suddenly missions become more difficult and even frustrating. And after that they somehow become eas(y)(ier) again. Wait, what ? There's no consistency here.I finished the game in 8 hours (which should've been 6-7), but if you want to buy and play everything I think you can add a few hours to that number.A decent game, nothing more, nothing less. Is it worth it ? You decide ![Rating: 71/100]			"

												It took me a while to get used to the controls for driving but then this game got really fun.It's a cocktail containing Grand Theft Auto / Mario / Teenage Munant Ninja Turtles / Cobra and other retro games. And they mix perfectly together.The game offers a huge arsenal of vehicles, weapons, environments, challanges and missions to keep you occupied. I liked the game so much that I needed to 100% complete the game and it only took me 16 hours ;DYou can even change the screen settings to match all sorts of old game emulators and also features great soundtracks.If you like old school games, pixels, gta and open world freedom get this game. It's more then worth the money.			"

Its absolutely a must if you grew up back in the day like me and want to relive what made games back then so great. Its so convincing i often find myself forgetting it was made recently instead of back in 1987. Though, if youre one of the new-age kids where graphics are everything, you might want to pass. For the rest of us, I highly recommend it.			"

												One of the best indie retro games I have played so far. Though shortly after completing the action-packed story mode I start to run out of things to do :(Free Roam gets old quick and hunting down lootbags and invisible walls are such a chore.I have an idea! The cabbie minigame is a great nod to taxi mode in GTA. How about you add a vigilante mode with a police car (or with the Biffman suit) where in you hunt down criminals in a limited time! Or maybe you can add more enemy units if you increase your threat level like choppers or robots! itBut if you can not add all that I shall appreciate it if you add more sidequests or something.			"

I stopped playing at one point, not because it was a bad game, but because I got overwhelmed with the Open-World stuff like the various challenges and time attacks and everything else. I'll probably be revisiting this game shortly, but take it from me, there's PLENTY in this game to do and to keep yourself busy with. Not to mention all the retro mini-games they have like a Virtual Boy styled Super Meat Boy game and other Arcade games included in this.			"

												Retro City Rampage is a unique sort of indie game. It was originally an attempt to remake GTA3 for the NES console, and became it`s own project that was ported to the PC. The influences from that game are very clear, as are the other games the author sought to parody.The game from intro screen to gameplay is pure NES. It replicates many of the problems that programmers had creating for that system, and in a lot of ways moves past them. The gameplay is modern, it runs at a very nice framerate and in general reminds me a lot of GTA2 in some odd way. It is also riddled with references, it shoots them out almost as much as a bodily function. So if you like loaded action packed indie games that don`t take themselves seriously, I can`t recommend this game any more.			"

It all comes in an appealing 8-bit art style.After the original insanity subsides, you will find plenty of fun missions, almost all of which are based on classic NES games. A great buy for anyone who played Zelda, Contra, Bionic Commando or Mario and wanted it to be overhead and open-world. For those new to gaming or that have only played recent releases, there are recognizable unlockable characters like Meat Boy, CommanderVideo, and even Steve from Minecraft. This is a game made for anyone to enjoy.			"

Even if it does use ""8-bit"" as its chief aesthetic, since that's apparently ""the big thing"" amongst indie devs.The difficulty works too. Its difficult but not flatout ""f*** you"" hard like most. There's a nice amount of customization options too including screen borders homaging old Arcade bezels and the Game Boy's old♥♥♥♥♥sepia screen.Plus its a near-recoloured Claude from GTA3 and a hilarious ripoff of Doc Brown trying to stop a Potara fusion Doctor Robotnik/Wily from takin gover the world.

												This is the most 80's game about the 80's that ever 80'd. I can't think of any 80's phenomenon this game didn't reference. Maybe Alf? The game is a pretty fun 2D gta with minigames and homages to 8 bit classics. Gets pretty tough near the end of the main story, with lots of frantic old school action. There are callbacks to Mario, Mega Man, Contra, Battletoads, even Castlevania. Looking forward to the sequel!			"

												This is just a disappointment, especially since I was following this project from back when it was being made for the NES.The first impression is good, like the GTA1 in eight bits... but when you delve into it, it becomes really annoying really quickly. The controls are clunky, driving is incredibly imprecise, combat is just unfun. Any mission that requires dealing with multiple enemies is a huge pain. Graphics don't stand out in any way among the other retro titles. Music is okay, but... just okay. It's pretty forgettable, I didn't find a tune that would stick with me.As for the positives, I really liked all of the nods to classic games and movies from the 80's/90's, but that's not nearly enough to save this title. Overall, IMHO there's very little enjoyment to be had. A lot of effort definitely went into making this game and I appreciate that, but it just doesn't work as a whole.			"

												This game is amazing! I love retro games and if you loved em I have a good feeling you will enjoy this game. The story is great and you will have a blast just pointing out all the old school game references. It's fun as hell!!  AND it offers tons of video options that just make the game so much more fun to play with scan lines and different old system colors, arcade cabinet style and many many others.. it feels like emulating the classic consoles and monitors.

												Before i start my review , lett me point out this game plays way better with a gamepad or controller. It works fine with a keyboard but the game is more difficult and less enjoyable to me.This game is a game full of suprises and yet so much cliché, where you go wtf and say ""ahaha now i get the reference"".The game is kind of a parody of the old gta games, talking about gta 1-3, where you run around in an open world and do quests and sidequests (or ♥♥♥♥ around and do what you want). When you start the game however you instantly notice this is a throwback to the past with references for movies, news and games from the 90's and early 2000's. The basic gameplay is you running, stomping and killing enemies and getting from point a to b. Unlike the old gta games you can get a highscore for killing and stealing stuff which makes free roaming more enjoyable, but the main part of the game are the quests. So far being 5 hours into the campaign i found it extremely enjoyable to find the references in these missions. The missions often contain new power-ups, minigames, new characters and items to keep the game interesting for longer playthoughs. Retro city rampage also has a good sence of humor and made me laugh several times. The animations are quite good as well altough they are pretty simple sprites. Something i have to mention, i like to play the game for around 30 min.-1 hour everytime i play. I think that the game might start to bore you after playing it for more than 2 hours in one playthrough.Overall i love the stylized graphics and great music a lott, altough if the references can't interest you or if you are to young to get them the game loses some of it's potential. If you like getting highscores, have a good laugh and do quests where you get struk by references at every corner this game is something for you! If you would would like a game with some good mechanics, lotts of minigames and some hours of gameplay you might also like retro city rampage. This game does not have multiplayer for people looking to play with friends!Overall i would give the game a 83/100 Retro city rampage is surely worth the 9€ or regional equivalent. If you think this is to expensive or are doubting that you would like it, then i advise to wait for a sale			"

It is kind of like the first Grand Theft Auto Game in gameplay, but with a ton of mini-games and silly ways to play.Took me about 4-5 hours to complete, but I did not do all the side-quests.  Many of the story missions feel like side-quests but you don't care because you Beat up the ""Saved by the Bell"" cast, Play Bit-Trip runner at an arcade, and smash peoples heads like your Mario.Several guns, a bit of auto-aim helps, and silly melee combat.  Just the right amount of original gameplay and lots of throw back gameplay like SMASH TV arena level.If you loved Nintendo Games and want to play a juiced up, silly, reference to them.  I would buy it!			"

												If you are an 80s/90s kid you will fall in love with the hundreds upon hundreds of references to movies, tv shows, and even video games! suprise surprise!. A game that used to be planned to just be a fan GTA3 demake (named Grand Theftendo) but after it was shelved it revived as this game. The combat is pretty fun and funny at times (with mario style jump stomps) and the vehicles are pretty sweet too (from a yoshi motorcycle to kip from knight rider). Also some of the options in this game give you so much joy as some video filters can change the game to looking as if you're playing it in a Virtual Boy and even borders to look like different TVs (with one being an arcade cabinet with cool stickers of instructions). If you are an old school gamer that loves the times of 8-bit, chiptunes, and nostalgia then you definately need to pick this game up. so, are you a bad enough dude to play Retro City Rampage? I should hope so.			"

												I played almost every retro styled game and I got to say that this may be the BEST retro game of all time.The game itself is a GTA 1/2 clone, built in a 8-bit style with many oldschool references, including Back to the Future, Frogger, They See me Rollin' etc. There are three modes: Storyline, Arcade and Freeroam. Freeroam is basically Story Mode without the Story. Arcade mode is awesome, includes so many awesome different mini games. The Story itself is amazing and filled with so many references and stuff that just blows my mind.Play this game. You will not regret it.			"

												This game. Where to begin. This game is like pixelated GTA minus the multiplayer, but to compensate it adds some of the best and most 80's/90's references I've seen in a game to date. You are instantly greeted with references from things like Back to the Future, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and so many more. Gameplay's a bit iffy, but overall pretty good. In total, 9/10.

												In the beginning was the NES, then about 12 years later the PSone and the game GTA.Now here's an amazing mix of the distant past, the even more distant past combined into a brilliant GTA (the first two) parody.Normally I think references are bad writing, but less so the more well known classic (ninja turtles, bill & ted, back to the future) 80's references which often just make enough of an apperance to keep things moving quickly. And considering it states right at the begining that it's a parody, it works in a beautifully ( parody is fair use under copyright law: ) cheeky manner.RCR's gameplay absolutely thrashes the original GTA (and all the GTA's in my opinion, but I may be alone in that) that it is so closely based on. Especially the handling of the vehicles which is a joy and easier to both run down lots of pedestrians, and drive safely with traffic.I've kept this review relatively short for the short amount of time I've actually played it, but I've played enough to know that I love it.9.4/10Oh, and the grim reaper mission just has me completely beat. I just can't kill them all fast enough.			"

												If you are an older gamer like myself, you want two things:  To relive old games you loved with ruby-coloured glasses, and to chuckle at parody games and reliving ""those were the days"" moments in your head, either recalling difficulty, or when you first started up an NES console.  This game, is for people like myself who have been desiring something to scratch the itches I had mentioned earlier.  A nifty, retro-reference laced game, I have found references from the early 80s through 2000s, I've enjoyed gameplay I have longed for since the first Grand Theft Auto, while indulging in gameplay that is remarkably easier to control.  Between the subtle and blatant nods to influences of the past, with gameplay to tickle your nostalgia bone (GUNGAMUNGA!  Or whatever that phrase was for the satire of the followers of Sun Yun Moon used by DMA Designs,) or to entice the player who loved the original GTAs and Death Rally who wanted their funny bone tweaked, but no desire to grind the skills once more on game systems who's control is nearly as much an enemy as the opponents programmed in.

												Retro City Rampage (DX) is a typical ""retro"" game which isn't afraid of making fun of itself and the whole 80, 90's genre of gaming with many reference to TV and movie from that times as well. In fact the whole game is full of references everywhere , some obvious , some more obscure which will only make sence if you have knowledge or even better experienced the shows or games they are making fun of.The graphics are over the top retro 8'bits and many gameplay mechanics reminds me of the games of that era, packed in a GTA aspirated but of course over the top game-frame. The creator of this game used a lot of time to give you the feeling of playing those antiquated systems . There are also many funny commentaries of the state of gaming both practical and moral which can even apply today. At one point the hero of the game regret one of his past transgressions, the other character listening to the ""player"" (yes the player's name in the game is ""player"", another pun) comments ironically that he should maybe stop routinely running over and killing innocent bystander while he is at it.This is a funny comment on heroes in games (and medias generally) sometimes committing large scale genocide in order to ""save the day"".The gameplay is actually ok and refreshingly diverse, but it's obvious the creator prioritized putting references and puns in almost every frames of the game. As a result, the game itself might feel too short and small, the city especially could have been a tad larger,  and I can understand the criticism. I still would recommend the game for the well done retro feeling , funny puns , especially but not only if you grew up in the 80's and 90's. It's not very expensive to begin with but if you get a discount at some sales, it's really worth it as long as you have some interest in game culture and ready for a game that doesn't take itself very seriously.

While firing weapons or walking, other random buttons were being inputted (holding down would move down and then occasionally move left and fire/move right/move left).The arcade games have no checkpoints or way of saving.

												I will be honest when I first got this game I enjoyed it but thought it was way to hard. The missions all seemed very hard to complete and I gave up on it. However this new version seems to be a lot easier to play and to enjoy. Also the resolution on the sprites look a lot better. Before they were very hard to see. Its also got a lot of 80's references inside the game that I really enjoy. A fun and so far easy game to enjoy.Ok so I got to the very end boss... The few levels before meeting the head boss were not up to the level of play I had expected thru the entire game sadly. Most are one hit kill=deaths. Their is an underwater where if you touch a gear you insta killed. Not to be out done on this insta kill. Also just a side note. I am tired of indie developers including insta kills in their games. TIRED OF THIS TREND. Their is a mini boss fight inside of a building with gears and some chicks who have rockets that will push you into being insta killed. Then you have the mini boss who can also insta kill you. Sigh.I did manage to beat the mini boss. So then we come to the last boss. Ugh. Sigh. Head pounding on desk at this point. Your a car with machine guns. This is fine. Why do I have to get carpal tunnel syndrome hitting the fire button for every single shot??????? Thats right no continous fire button you have to press it for each and every shot. Ugh again and of course its not just and the boss on a road. Oh no its you and the boss and other cars and exploding canisters just for more fun. You get 5 chances however pressing the button each and every time to fire( the boss has a life bar that is almost as long as my arm) will cause your to develop carpal syndrome.I will say I enjoyed the game till the very end levels that still have me scratching my head over these insta kill levels. So their you have it. Is it worth your time? I would say it depends on how much it costs. I would say for the $10 dollars asking price. NO. Its way to expensive for the game price. On sale for under $5 dollars then yes.			"

												Retro City Rampage is a trip down memory lane with awesome game refrences and funny writing but will the game be worth playing ? In Retro City Rampage you play as the Player. He is a criminal that is trying to make it big in the city of Theftopolis, But when an accident happens player is sent back in time and must get back to the present. So hows the game ? Its pretty much an 8 bit GTA and its great. The game has many awesome things that will make you chuckle or will make you want to break youre Pc into Bits. The game is presented in a top down persective and is played in a sandbox style of gameplay. The game will let you explore the colourfull city of Theftopolis and its a big city with lots of stuff to do. Many missions are parodies of classic games like Metal Gear Solid, Paperboy and many more. Many missions have you to pick up some itmes for people and in the other missions you just shoot youre way through dozens of enemies. Now overall there are some problems that haunt thsi game. One of those problems the game is incredibly difficult and some missions are unforgiveble. Sometimes youre charecter can get stuck in the buildings and this game has a cover system that barely works. This game also has an amazing soundtrack to match the style of the game. Overall a really fun game and has many great moments and for the price its going for its one of the games you must own right now i give Retro City Rampage a 9/10			"

												This ""game"" survives as nothing but a hodgepodge of references. They're cute and all, but much like the book Ready Player One, as a standalone piece of media, it's pretty boring and poorly developed. Seriously, game portion of this is fully lackluster, poorly designed, and uninteresting. It's seriously just a series of references tied together with the most boring OR frustrating gameplay you could think of.			"

NOTE: Though my time on this game says 0.1. hours, I played this game on the 3DS to completion. This may affect some of the comments on controls, but everything else is accurate to pretty much any versionRetro City Rampage ostensibly is an 80s homage/NES recreation of Grand Theft Auto. However, getting into the game, one will quickly realize that it's a dumping ground for pop culture references, with a game that cannot decide what the hell it wants to be. Graphics/ArtUsually, faux-retro graphics is a kiss of death for indie games. Far too many developers use 8-bit homage as an excuse to make lazy pixel art. I am willing to excuse it in this instance considering that RCR was originally supposed to be an actual NES conversion of Grand Theft Auto. The character portraits are about what you'd expect from a higher-budget NES game, with the in-game art being fairly smallSound DesignThe music is good, but that's to be expected from Jake Kaufman. That said, he's done far better work for far better games (Check Shovel Knight, one of the few truly great retro throwbacks.) Not that you'd be able to hear the music unless you muted the sound effects, which is a very smart move because Retro City Rampage has some of the most ear-grating sound effects I've ever heard in a game. Every few seconds, there's digitized screeching, what's supposed to be sirens and constant white noise that is supposed to be gunshots.Story/Character-World Building/DialogueOnce upon a time in the 2000s, there were two directors named Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. After being part of the staff for the popular Scary Movie series, they set out to make their own comedies, such as Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie. Everyone hated these movies, and deservedly so, because in lieu of making jokes about pop-culture, they would just reference the fact that it exists. Seltzer and Friedberg are now pariahs in Hollywood, because everyone hates them. What does this have to do with Retro City Rampage, you ask? Because I'm convinced that this game's writers' only comedic reference were Selzter and Friedberg movies. The game does not tell jokes. The game tells references. Technically, the whole plot of the game is an *ahem* ""parody"" of Back to the Future. The tone of the game is set right at the beginning, where within the span of about six minutes, the game references Mega Man 2, Duck Hunt, The Dark Knight, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The A-Team, Contra, Mario Bros, Frogger, and Bill and Ted (or maybe it's Doctor Who.) See, the joke is that you probably recognize these things and they are there. The villain is literally Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the Hedgehog, except his name is Buttnick. There's a level where you go to a factory. The joke is that the robot is the Destructoid robot.  H I L A R I O U S. GameplayThe story mode will showcase several problems with the game1. There are several missions where you are faced with a ton of enemies, which showcases how bad the lock-on aiming is. It's inconsistent with when it wants to actually lock on. 2. The game has knockback when you are damaged, which will frequently kill you in later stages3. The game will force you into random diversions, usually to show off another ""parody."" Want to ride a slow bike that can barely turn? No? Too bad! The developer remembered that Paperboy existed. Want to throw barrels at a wall and have to constantly douse yourself when you catch fire? It's a good thing that Tapper was a thing the developer knew about. How about having an automatic runner stage featuring a guy who can propel himself with his sweat? Don't know what the homage it, but you get it anyways! Then comes the last two stages. Now, in most video games, you would need to use all the skills you've learned in the game so far to the test but- hold the phone. The developer decided that for the final stages, the player should throw all their skills away and play freaking Outrun. I could excuse the arcade minigames because those were optional, but here, you are forced to play Outrun, while Dr. Robotnik fires missiles at you that are timed to hit you right when it's impossible to avoid them.Grade: D "

Basic InformationTitle: Retro City Rampage™ DXGenre: Action, Adventure, Indie, RacingDeveloper: Vblank Entertainment, Inc. Publisher: Vblank Entertainment, Inc.	Release Date: 11 Nov, 2014OverviewThis has to be one of my favourite 8-bit games on steam. So what is this game exactly? Well it's exactly what it says it is. A 8-bit open world with a nostalgia feel to it, it really has a nice feel to the game. If Grand Theft Auto where made into a 8-bit graphic, with top down perspective, and some inapropriate humour then this is what you would expect from this game.Game PlayI really wasn't expecting this game to be as fun as it was. Although I have a few faults with the game play sid eof this game, overall it's rather impressive. As you would expect in any open world game there are quite a few missions to get through, and then there are side missions that may help you in  the actual missions later on. Some of the side missions are rather quite difficult, and the way that some of them are set out aren't really all that fun to play. After doing a few side missions I kind of just went on with the main story and left them out. They might've helped me in the main missions but I don't really think it would of all that much. As for the main missions, some of them where brutally difficult for me. The final boss wasn't really all what I thought it would be, moving from side to side and dodging whatevere that guy was shooting at you. I did rage a few times but beat it in the end. On a positive note, some of the missions where quite funny and simply just what  guy would do to waste time, for example there was a mission to waste time. So you get a hover suit and just bash people on the head instead of waiting. The characters where a little dull and boring, and the story really isn't ll that much, I basically knew what was going on almost all the time without the game telling me what to do. Get a sevral items for the Time Machine and then get back. Not really all that fun but kept me entertained with the decent missions to keep me playing. The game took me about 9 hours to complete, I still sometimes go on it just to run people over in a car and mess around.Score (Out Of 10): 7 - Some difficult missions and a dull story, but some really fun missions to play, general fun messing about in the overworld and some funny humour.Graphics/art styleThe game (if you haven't already noticed) has a 8-bit styled graphic to it which really works well with everything that happens in the game. Everything looks like you would be able to play it in a old school arcade machine. Although some of the animations are a little lazy, for example the cars don't really have any wheel animation on the ground. This can sometimes make it look like everything is just moving across the road with the wheels not running across the road. I'm not really sure what you could've done to solve that but it was kind of annoying  to see that sometimes for me. Other than that nothing else to complain about the game graphics wise.Score (Out Of 10): 9 - Really nice 8-bit graphics, but some lazy animations here and there.Music & SoundThe music and sound for this game where both really good. The sounds for certain things weren't at all generic and really fit well with the 8-bit style of the game, the music also fits well with certain scenarios in the game. Whether you're killing a bunch of robots in a tower or just chilling along the road smashing everything in your path! The game really sets the music well.Score (Out Of 10): 10 - Some really fitting music and no generic sound effects throughout the gameConclusionThis is probably one of my favourite 8-bit games on steam. With it's decent overworld map to mess about in, the music and sounds along with the awesome 8-bit graphics make it all feel like a pretty solid game. Do be prepaired though for some difficult missions that you might come across in the game that might leave you playing it for more than you want to. But some great humour and game play implemented into this game.For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here. "

												Retro City Rampage is a great open world game that manages to have zero filler. Every mission is unique, which means you'll never get bored with it during the six or seven hours the storyline lasts. There are also some pretty fun challenge modes. The graphics are some of the best done ""fake nes"" graphics I've seen in an indie game, and the game is overall very pleasant to look at. You can't go wrong with this one.			"

This is the perfect game for anyone that has ever played an 8bit game in their life to the newer generations that get to see how graphics do not mean sh*t when it comes to great content. I scroll through my games list on steam and everytime I see Retro City Rampage It always makes me grin and laugh.

												I dunno.  It's kind of tiring.  The fundamental game is really well built and is fun to play, but over time it just doesn't feel enjoyable.This is strange since Retro City Rampage is full of unique content, and the game always keeps you doing different things.  The story mode is just an excuse to string you along from one referential set piece to the next, but what's interesting is that many references take the form of one-off gameplay homages rather than merely verbal shout-outs; I think that's rather novel—interacting with references to interactive things where the reference is the kind of interacting you do.  I don't think I've seen that before, and here is an entire game made out of it.  Also, it's rather remarkable to note how flexible the basic mechanics are as they reproduce the mechanics of other games without actually changing.So this is a hugely impressive game in one regard, but I don't very much like playing it.  You should definitely try it sometime, though.			"

												Retry City Rampage DX copies the core gameplay loop of classic GTA, with lots of arcade style minigames added, along with references and inside jokes. Some of the gags had me laugh out loud, while many others had me cringe. The main storyline is deliberately bad, bogging down in collecting arbitrary parts for a time machine over and over again.So while this is not a great game, I can't help but give it thumbs up because I honestly had a good time for the 6 hours it took me to finish. There is enough variety and unexpected challenges at every turn to keep you interested, and the whole look and feel is rather authentic.This could have been a much better game if the developers had taken the storytelling aspect more serious instead of relying on the audience going crazy over excessive referencing of established franchises and indie games. It's definitely worth the price tag, and if you catch it on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it. You won't regret it.			"

												On the one hand, a tremendous amount of work went into creating tons of mini-games in service of making a reference a minute, and that merits respect. On the other hand, that mostly ends up serving as a reminder of games you liked a lot more than Retro City Rampage.If you want open-world mayhem, go with something like a Saints Row game, where the city is easier to enjoy. If you want referential humor, grab something like Shut Up And Jam Gaiden, which puts more effort into its punchlines than ""Hey remember that thing.""			"

												Grand Theftendo was a homebrew Grand Theft Auto game that was being developed by Brian Provinciano for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was developed in 2002, and was due to be released in Fall of 2005. It was never released, and instead it was replaced with a brand new game, Retro City Rampage. Grand Theftendo was originally going to be a toned-down version of Grand Theft Auto III.Extremely fun. Definitely recommended.			"

												Retro City Rampage was already a decent game, but the DX version made it even better! Retro City Rampage DX is a GTA-styled game (but with the old school topdown-view), plus all kinds of references from the eighties thrown in to it that you can renember. I'm just 13 years old, but there are quite a lot of refernces that even I know. For example, Bundy's Wedding Chapel is clearly a reference to Al Bundy from Married with Children. Doc Choc and that time traveling-phonebooth are just references to Doc Brown from Back to the Future and Bill & Ted's Phonebooth.  I like the retro graphics, and the fact that you can change the graphics to old monitor settings, like CGA, Monochrome, and EGA. It's not the best game ever, but the game is pretty cool. And, it's just fricking GTA without the violent blood splatters. And I love blood splatters and unnecessary violence! *sarcasm* I would recommend buying the game, though not through Steam itself. If you go to the official website [retrocityrampage.com] you can get the game for 10 bucks, the same price on Steam, but included with (of course!) the Steam-key for Retro City Rampage DX, an DRM-free version of Retro City Rampage DX, plus all of the soundtracks! But, if the game is 75% off, then why bother and just buy it from Steam. 8/10			"

												It starts good with a few laughs from 80s and 90s games and movies, but unfortunately, giggles turn into frustration as the levels get more and more ""frantic"", not helped by the headache-inducing simple graphics.I gave up after a mandatory mission where you're supposed to chase a car by foot while keeping some distance to not get spotted, which was fine to begin with. It takes a turn for the worst when you have to get coffee to ""not fall asleep"" which jolts the game speed to INSANE for every cup you buy during the chase. Then, SUDDENLY you get a prompt for ""Get a car"" with pointers blinking so fast it'll make your head spin, and by this time the game goes so fast it's the final stages of Life Force all over again - impossible to control. And with no Konami code to save you this time.That's a recipe for some truly disastrous game design: Completely unable to handle the car you either crash into the car you're supposed to have some distance to, or alert the driver by crashing into other cars, or fall too far behind. In any case, you need to start the stage ALL OVER AGAIN, and I really can't see this being a fun challenge to overcome at all.So, game started out well, but halts your progress indefintely by having mandatory impossible missions like mentioned above, and I can not recommend that kind of boring work to anyone who wants to have FUN with a game.

												The game's too short and easy and the whole game after the 1st mission is just a bunch of random events revolving around copycat characters you couldn't care less about. 99% of the plot just rides the Back to the Future train and occasionally mocks soccermoms, the NES/80's references are all either used as a (weak) basis for story missions or appear in passing mention, like the devs were just ticking down a checklist of things to reference whilst they made this.The BTTF♥♥♥♥♥♥in of itself is wasted anyway because nothing in the game world (if you bother exploring it before the 1st mission) actually changes even though you've supposedly time-travelled a number of years into the future/past(the game never makes it clear on which one it is which goes to show how little thought they put into it). Yup, they made the whole game a time-travel plot just to wax nostalgia over one freaking film that not everyone is going to have that sort of attachment to.Most of the side-content such as the challenges and mini-games are a joke and take almost no effort to get gold on. Most of the weapons are identical other than how much damage they do and apart from the speed shoes, the power-ups all feel like an after-thought the developers force you to use in certain missions in an attempt to get you to care about their existence.The graphics, whilst I get are supposed to match the look of a NES game, are lazy- most of the game world looks the exact same despite being so small, the actual character sprites are ♥♥♥♥in microscopic and have almost no detail so everyone's basically a pallete-swap of each-other with the only distinguishing features being hair/hat. I understand this was originally supposed to be a homebrew NES game (EDIT: proto of said NES game is playable in the DX version, it's cute to look at... for about 5 seconds), but they really shot themselves in the foot in the graphics department by trying to make it ""authentic"", especially when I can think of God-knows how many actual NES games with better graphics than this.The soundtrack is HUGE and there's a decent amount of variety but you barely get to hear any of the good tracks in the actual game unless you fiddle about with the radio stations cos they all play in the story missions which only last around 4-5 minutes at most cos, as I said, this game is too easy. Otherwise get used to listening to the same 3-4 songs throughout the game that get annoying really fast.For a game that took 7 years to make and kept me waiting for almost 2 years after I first heard about this game before it came out, I was pretty damn disappointed. Buy it when it's on sale and you have about 6 hours to kill, otherwise if you want a good NES/80's parody game, play Abobo's Big Adventure for free on Newgrounds and stay the hell way from this.			"

												While this game seems fun enough what lies beanith is a game filled with problems.At first I was thrilled with the world and it's characters, the game doesn't even remotely take itself seriously.  With nods to practically every game and movie out there it seemed flowing with jokes, the colorful city reminded my of the original GTA.But one I got down to actually playing I was sorely dissapointed.  The combat is basically win or die, with no health upgrades or body armor in the game you basically can only take a few hits before you die, and you will die a LOT!  Your character can't even swim!The aiming system with the guns...confuses me to say the least, I really don't get the lock-on system.  The game features like, 10 melee weapons...all of which do as much damage as your first does, with the exception of the sword, and except for dying you can't get rid of a weapon you don't want.As for the wanted system, it more or less works like GTA, and for a game that is supposed to be about rampaging it fills fast enough.  But it also sometimes fills for no reason at all, I was literally just sitting outside my house cycling through my melee weapons and the wanted system went to full red, a glitch I would assume...if it didn't happen again and again.I could go on and on, but basically they tried to make a nice little shoot-em up game with nods to every ""oldie"" game and movie, which by itself is a nice concept, but as an actual game this one blows...hard.

I must admit the these were really funny and done well. It's crazy how many options are there to tweak color scheme to mimic certain systems or create your own mix.Only thing I have to say was bad is the ending boss.

												I have only barely tried this game, a couple of times. This is not an in-depth review at all, but simply the thoughts I have about it at this point.I just can't seem to get into this game. The introduction to the game is hard to follow. It's like everything's on speed, and they tried to add as many retro references they could into as short a time as possible. The graphics are reminiscent of games of old, but the picture is so incredibly busy, it's hard to register what you're actually seeing. It doesn't help with all the achievement and unlock popup messages that seemingly constantly pop up on the already busy screen. Controls feel really awkward, and what you're supposed to do exactly isn't always clear.The biggest issue for me though, is that it's not really any fun. There's nothing pulling on me here, unexpectedly. I'd rather go back and play the old Grand Theft Auto games (which was the primary inspiration for this game, apparently) or pretty much any other retro game than this.			"

												I've been following this since it was supposed to be a homebrew NES remake of GTA3.  It was obviously made with tons of love, and the ""LOL '80s,"" stuff isn't as groan-inducing as it could be.  However this thing is littered with outright horrible design decisions like the trailing mission that the game repeatedly apologizes for (and which got overhauled, and made worse since the first patch), or the Tapper sequence where the arc on the barrels depends on finding the exact pixel to stand on.  Oh, and all around horrible person, Jim Sterling is in it.  I really really wanted to like it, but beyond the first ten minutes, and the maze toward the very end, there's not much to celebrate here.			"

												I don't know why I forced myself through this torturous 15 hours of mediocrity. Controls are extremely awkward even playing on a PS2 controller, gameplay is dull. One thing it has though is varied gameplay - there are many missions that reference other games. Unfortunately that's where it also fails, the game is a massive parody, everything is a parody of a parody. After the first few ""heh""s it becomes over used. Then it tries to have some original content and you get explosive sweat man. Suffice to say, I didn't ""get it"". I grew up in the 80s on Paper Boy, TMNT, Skate or Die, Battletoads, Sonic, Mario.. I get the references, but I don't get why anyone would think this is fun. Retro City Rampage is like someone on a diet who remembers how awesome fast food was, then rolled out some dough, topped it with chocolate sauce, covered it with fried chicken, ice-cream, hotdog buns, skittles and Big Mac sauce and expect you to eat it - but don't worry guys, if it tastes bad it's just a parody of a pizza. Can think of many better things to spend $1 on.			"

												Let me start off by saying that this game surprised me. I mean, I for one never thought I could actually be bored with a GTA knockoff. You learn something new every day.Retro City Rampage commits the cardinal creator's sin of giving you content without context. It is essentially the Family Guy of video games, making references to various films and games that only make people laugh in that 'oh, I get that reference' kind of way. I can say nothing negative about the graphics or the controls, as they are watertight, but the story and characters left much (MUCH) to be desired.			"

												All the elements for a great game are there, but are entirely wasted. As good as 8-bit open world sounds, it all begins to feel pretty pointless very quickly. There's no real motivation to do the side missions and minigames other than high scores. Roaming around town quickly becomes a chore unless you have one of the better vehicles. I can't help but wonder why this wasn't just a linear, old-school beat-em-up, but as it stands now, the open-world element of the game is entirely superfluous.  I'd give this one a pass unless the premise really interests you.			"

												This game has a lot going for it. The positives:80’s and 90’s references are amusing. Free roam gameplay is really fun. Challenges and sprees are also great (although, getting gold in some of these is too hard).I absolutely love the retro style. However, there are many issues that really drag this game down:The final boss, I gave up. I’m not going back. The last few levels were horribly designed, and were simply not fun. TMNT sewer levels were bad then, and RCR’s reiteration is also bad. With regard to the story, don’t ask why, it’s not supposed to make sense. Why should I care about what’s going on, if the game is constantly telling me not to care. Performance: no issues playing on PC or through the steam link. Throughout my gameplay I used an XB1 controller, and I did not encounter any issues. Overall, this game is a 2 out 5. I purchased this game on sale, and I got enjoyment out of it, but I won’t be coming back for more.			"

												One of the most overhyped games of all time.  Most of the game is 30 second snippets of better games from the 80's.  Until you get to the end of the game when the levels go on FAR too long.  The difficulty balance is off too.  Again, most of the game is a cakewalk, you can ease through it with no effort.  Then you get to the last 10 levels or so (out of 64) and the game just becomes a bull♥♥♥♥♥♥sandwich.  The dam level of TMNT, for example, is considered one of the worst of the NES era.  So of course this game makes you do it twice.  Road Blaster is one of my favorite games of all time, but the end of the game forces you to do it 6 times, wrapping up with a boss that you can only beat with luck.  He has a specific pattern, but he ""cheats"" in that sometimes his missles go where you are going to be, not were you were when he fired them.  Sometimes, but not always.  It's a violation of the boss pattern and had me throwing my controller and screaming profanities by the end of the night.  The graphics are cute for about 5 minutes, then you realize you can't really tell what the hell is going on most of the time.  The chiptunes are pretty good, but once the loop is over, the game won't start a new song unless you trigger a cutscene or get in a car.			"

												Retro City Rampage is quite the interesting game, not because it's fun, but rather it manage to reach the point of boredom and cheap thrills. I have mix feelings about this game. While I did enjoy some of the references it's somewhat distracting. Don't get me wrong, I like the reference to ""Smash TV"" as much as the next gamer, but if I want to play ""Smash TV"" I'll play ""Smash TV"".  In fact there are a lot of moments like that. Everytime they bring up those games it just made me wish I were playing the real thing instead. Without the attetion to detail or the at times humorous dialogue the game would be nothing more than your standard GTA clone (except not nearly as fun). I don't know, maybe you'll like the content in here, but it's not for me.			"

												This game is great....for 15 minutes.    In reality, it's a parody that, like many other parodies, is only funny for a little bit.   It's a romp through nerd culture from the 1960's to present, primarily in the realm of video games and television.   This leaves a vast source of material to cover, and unfortunately, it makes the novice mistake of trying to hit on way too much at once. Gameplay-wise, the game is so-so.  It plays like GTA 1 (the old one) but the best vehicle, from what I've seen, is the super-speed boots that let you run over people with the force of a speeding train.   There are early and wonderful nods to Doctor Who, Back To The Future, old-school Metal Gear, and many other games, movies and shows.   Unfortunately, they are wrapped in a plot that seems like Beavis and Butthead wrote it from a cartoon rehab center somewhere.   The parodies either drag on or are barely touched and then abandoned.  Eventually, you will lose interest in the plot and just tool around trying to make money (which is far too easy), and try to find new things to do.  One of my biggest gripes about this game really had to be the implementation of player-earned penalities.   It makes sense if you become a raging alcoholic, you turn into a fatass and nobody likes you (see the Fable series).   That's not how this works.  Instead, you wander into a ""noodle shop"" and buy mushrooms....and half of them hurt you.  One, especially at low levels, can kill you dead.   You can't tell by the names; it all seems like a good time.    Nintendo-hard choices of how to get digitally stoned make no sense, especially when you can die.  Even in the 80's, ""Winners dont' use drugs"" was about as far as any game took it before handing you a hero that pops painkillers and drinks liquor to heal themselves. I do like one little easter egg; your ""home base"" allows  you to play an old console video game.  That game is an alpha build of Retro City Rampage.   I'd love it if more games did this (how badass would GTA V be if you coudl play GTA 1 in the arcades?).   Try it, though.   When you feel how unpolished the alpha build was....and how the game feels pretty much exactly like that version....you'll want your money back.   Not recommended unless it's free or 99c and you want some pixel games to go with your booze.			"

Game soundtrack alone is worth the asking price.Many hours of fun to be had with this title. Includes a bunch of built-in games such as ""Virtual Meat Boy and Bit Trip"".A+			"

												Retro City Rampage might be one of the poorest attempts at cloning GTA in a long while. Developed by one man, which is cool admittedly, it's basically a Parody of both GTA and other games released throughout the years, which is its only saving grace. The parodies are funny! Everything from Duke Nukem to TMNT to Back To The Future to even Jean-Claude Van Damne are parodied and each one managed to get either a chuckle or a nice laugh from me at times. But that's the games only saving graceThe rest of the game is clunky, monotonous, and down right boring. It's main issue is that it plays its trap card too early with it's tutorial mission. After that, the game just copies itself to the point where even the jokes are boring. What hampers the game even more are the controls. Now I hate saying that the controls can ruin any game (I'm able to look past bad controls if the game is fun), but WOW! These controls are both bad and clunky! Not only is it a pain to move and aim, but the driving is what REALLY kills the game. I get the point that it's supposed to be emulating the NES in terms of gameplay, but come on! Even the driving games on NES had better controls then this clunker! When it comes to the shooting, it's even worse. There is supposed to be a lock on mechanic, but it's one of the worst ones I dealt with. Whenever you are shooting, you lock on to any near by targets and all your shots go there. The issue is that you STAY locked on when you are shooting and you can't freely aim at other targets without ceasing your fire and then firing again. This is a major hindrance when you are in gun fights when are you want to do is aim at another target but you keep targeting other stuff that AREN'T YOUR TARGETS!Sadly, I can not recommend this game what so ever. Not only does it fail in trying to be a good GTA clone, but it sadly fails in being a parody at times. It does make me mad though...when I first got this game, I loved it. But now, the more I play it, the less I love it and the more I get frustrated with it. Save your cash and skip this game.FINAL RATING: SKIP			"

												I completed the game and it was tedious. The nostalgia humour is relentless and the gameplay is as incoherent and frantic as the narrative. Only a handful of missions required some skill and were rewarding; the majority of the game is: drive somewhere, receive joke, complete trivial action.Music is very good, and the art style is cool.

												A pretty fun well made retro NES style game. Every mission you do is some reference to old school NES games or culture back then. It is basically a GTA game on Nintendo which is awesome. If they could've made a game like this for Nintendo it would still be known today as the greatest NES game of all time, but unfortunately 90% of NES games were garbage with the the other 10% being the classics we know. If you are an oldschool gamer or can at least appreciate old school games and aren't some little punk kid who thinks video games started with Call of Duty, give this a shot.			"

												Retro City Rampage is a mash-up of a lot of retro games from the 80's and 90's, with a few movie references in the mix, all set in a GTA (1) style world. Lovely premise, absolutely balls execution. This dyed heap of diarrhea is barely playable. In a failed attempt to recreate the difficulty of the so-called retro games, it's unbearably painful to play, especially the second half of the game. A few things are done right. It's occasionally funny, but tries a little too hard at times. The soundtrack is pretty sweet and hits the retro spot perfectly. However, once you actually start to play, all the good things get buried under a massive pile of failure. Bugs, unexplainable mechanics, pathetic controls and uninspired gameplay, only to name a few.Unless you're looking for a night filled with frustration, simply don't buy this game. If you need your fix for old skool games, actually play the real deal, not this half-arsed attempt at blending 50 games into one. + Soundtrack+ Pretty funny- Everything else3/10			"

												So I found this game in my basement the other day and I decided to pop it into the toaster. It was all burnt up and the copy got destroyed. So then I decided to go and steal it from the Steam Store and it play it on my computer.Upon actually getting into the game itself, I found myself attacked by a bunch of nerd-drawings all over the place! At first I was a little startled, then I realised that upon pressing my Xbox 360 controller's guide button, I was actually still sitting in my caddie playing on my Xbox 360! It was a little jarring to see that they had made another old game again.So after about an hour of cursing at the game and making up my own words with the f-bomb attached to them, I decided to get really mad. I pulled the game out of my Sega Master System and threw it into my fireplace/smashed it with a hammer/made it ""explode""/cuss at it for an extended period of time/let Mike Matei play it. I then told everyone to never play this game and went back to making my feature-length movie about old games.Thumbs up if you're an 80s kid.			"

												So yeah, this is a parody of GTA that relies on the unsurmountable amount of pop culture references to make you think it's doing something intelligent when it's not. The plot is completely neglectable, as it simply doesn't make sense. It's repetitive and so are the missions and dialogues, that try to be really clever with the most teen and buttdick humour ever. I was enjoying the sillines of it all until I realised that the dialogues were skippable and not funny, and that everywhere I went it was a hassle because the police was, well, hassling you everywhere. Not only that, but towards mission 40, the combat spikes up so much that it's frustratingly difficult and unfair - particularly for such a basic and not-thought-through system. It's simply not funny or engaging, and too frustrating. As a whole, yes, it's a mildly clever statement ""videogame plots never make sense and are over-the-top self-aggrandising rampages!!!"". But you can do exactly that with a much cleverer writing, humour and mechanics. Also, this game should have lasted two hours top, and it goes on and on and on and on unnecesarily. Man this is the first game that has made me rage quit and outright uninstall the game.			"

To add to the whole 80's retro theme the game is an 8 bit throw back to the NES days which may make it unlikable to those who are extremely obsessed with the latest and greatest graphics but for those who prioritize gameplay over graphics and are total children of the 80's and gratitious but very cartoon violence, they'll love this game.  Gameplay wise, it isn't unlike♥♥♥♥♥2, you go around doing missions and side quests, stealing cars, gunning down people, etc, and so on but what gives it an edge over GTA 2 is the games sense of humor.  I also recommed this title to those who are into the humor in Duke Nukem and Postal games, the Player (that's the lc's name) isn't as rauncy but it has a fair share of non pc humor.  For the record, the the last review was written with my old account (Devianza97) which I no longer have access to and need to get Steam to delete.			"

Gameplay wise, it isn't unlike♥♥♥♥♥2, you go around doing missions and side quests, stealing cars, gunning down people, etc, and so on but what gives it an edge over GTA 2 is the games sense of humor.  I also recommed this title to those who are into the humor in Duke Nukem and Postal games, the Player (that's the lc's name) isn't as rauncy but it has a fair share of non pc humor.  For the record, the the last review was written with my old account (Devianza97) which I no longer have access to and need to get Steam to delete.			"

												I'm only a teenager but i grew up playing the old text based games from the 80's. Like Leisure Suit Larry or King's Quest, i also enjoy old playstation 1 games. Retro City Rampage is a spoof of all the old good games rolled into a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 scenario. You'll see parody's of Paperboy, Leisure Suit Larry and from the front cover it's quite obvious, Back to the future.I haven't finished the game yet put it's pretty good so far, the music is pretty cool too. a spoofy 8 bit GTA at it's best.

 Amazing programming, solid and fun gameplay with lots of 80's and 90's nostalgia.  I got interested in the game because of its development history, it was originally developed as a homebrew game for the NES, which makes it one of the few retro games that could really run on retro hardware. It is only 22 mb large on my system, available for practically all operating systems (I am playing on linux) and all consoles, the dev made even a DOS port. That it is dedication and I think the programming of this game is really really well done.I finally bought the game because of a discount on steam and found out that the gameplay is also really fun, most things just feel right. There is not as much to do in the open world as in the ""real"" GTA games. I have rushed through the story missions, which I just finished, so there are still a lot of ""challenges"" for me to try. The story is fun, does not take itself too serious, but it is not deep, moving or particularly smart. The game is a satire and lives from its parodies of  old school games like Mario, Zelda and such, so it is definetly an advantage if you know those, but if you don't, it is still fun.  Some missions are definitly not easy, but usually doable, at least after a couple of tries, especially because the DX version features in-game tips (thank you dev). However, I would really recommend to play this game with a gamepad, I have not tried the keyboard control yet but I cannot imagine that it would feel as good as a gamepad.So if you like retro games, cool 8-bit graphics and music and running around an open world shooting everything and if you don't fear an occasional challenge, I am sure you will enjoy this game for about 10 hours at least. I have played it only for 7, but there are still many things I want to do.However, it is not a game that I will love in the same way as I love for example ""Zelda: A Link to The Past"" or ""Cave Story"". The world is not small, but it is also not deep, believable or full of charming characters, same as the flat main characters. A game can be a retro satire AND have a moving story with deep characters, as UNDERTALE proved. If you are looking retro game with a moving story, that might be more for you. However, the gameplay was definetly more fun in RCR, imo. I enjoyed it and will recommend it.			"

												WoaaahahwAW?! That's what this game will do to your mind. At least if you're an 80s-90s gamer of any age. The sheer amount of nostalgia will make your head explode, recompile, then explode again. Every mission is an adventure through time to the age of hardcore gameplay, simple (yet stylized) graphics, and amazing chiptune music.I'd try to list all the references, but I think my fingers would ignite from the effort. If you know what NES-era gaming was like, and have fond memories (even of the awful bits, like the Ninja Turtles game, especially the dam level), you will absolutely f**kin' LOVE this game. Period.The general gameplay recipe is this: take a decent dose of GTA, mix in some Saints Row shenanigans, add a hefty plethora of NES-era stuff (both references and gameplay... and graphics and sounds and...), as well as a generous portion of modernization in terms of controls and smoothness, and bam... you've got Retro City Rampage. Every single part of it is immensely enjoyable and relatable, while still being fresh enough to keep even the most ADHD-riddled brains occupied.To top it all of the developer even added a truly 8-bit version (playable *within* the game itself)... so much so that the extracted version will work just fine on an NES emulator!!! Just take a moment to think: this (or at least a *version* of this) was possible back in the 80s. This kind of gameplay and variety and just general awesomeness... it was all possible. My god... what have we been missing?!Look, this game is amazing. Hands down, flat out... amazing. From start to finish you won't be bored and, if anything, you'll just be craving finding the rest of the secrets and references. Get it NOW if you grew up playing NES-era games, and if not? Well... you'll enjoy it just the same (though I can't say you'll get the same sense of nostalgia that the rest of us will).The dev is basically a one-man show (who I have spoken with personally and is a truly kickass dude), has supported practically every platform out there (and for the rest is working diligently on it), and is ABSOLUTELY someone you should follow for future releases. Zero complaints, nothing but praise... not much more to say!			"

												Retro City Rampage does a good job of hinting at old games from the era it targets at, and even does a good job on some of the gameplay mechanics in game. However, if RCR is a must play for you i would HIGHLY recommend playing on console. RCR feels out of place on PC as it is constantly reminding you of its tedious and confusing key mapping; and even when you map the keys yourself, it still feels wrong. Different game mechanics, like the mario jump attack, do not work on keyboard, and as a PC gamer it pains me to see they did not put much time into thinking it through properly. It is hard to give this game a 'no' recommendation. RCR is a game filled with lots of things to do, from playing retro arcade games, to playing a brutal version of Paperboy, and it constantly tells funny jokes hinting at other retro titles. But it just does not work on PC as it feels like too much of a console port.Although this game does have full controller support, i would recommend players play it on its true platform; that being the PlayStation 3. If a PS3 is not available then buy yourself a controller for PC and save yourself the tedious controls and clunky gameplay with a keyboard.			"

												It's not bad, but it's worst offense is it's mundanity. I got bored, nothing more to it. It's not stupid bad, it just couldn't hold my attention. And those are the worst kind of games. The ones that are merely ""okay"" but not good enough to keep playing.Don't believe people's lies, this game doesn't have any pop culture references. This game is pop culture references. There isn't a single individual slice of this game which you can take out of context, show it to someone, and not have them say ""Hey, I recognize that"". The game is self aware if nothing else.Two out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( ) ( )			"

												Quite frankly, it's not at all worth it unless you were DEEPLY entrenched in the era this game constantly references.The controls lie on the awkward side, and it's nearly impossible to aim in combat, including the lock-on feature... which is annoyingly difficult to lock. Jumping is also difficult to aim correctly. It's probably better with a controller; haven't tried that myself.The graphics are meh, although I understand that's the point. The arcade-like borders around the game come off as pointless to me, thankfully they can be disabled in the options menu easily.The story is an excuse plot; acceptable for this sort of sandbox game, and of course allows you to run around a variety of enviroments parodying games of the era. However, again, if you weren't part of the era, most of the references will sail over your head.The gameplay: run, jump, shoot, evade police, etc. The story missions may screw with that a bit, but only temporarily.For the third time, don't bother unless you really, really know the era well. There isn't much more to this game past that, in my opinion.			"

												After four hours of Retro City Rampage there are two things to say:1. Technically superb, well playable.2. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing obnoxious as♥♥♥♥♥♥ References, references, references and humor from preschool.   The WAY it is designed, the sounds, the ""story"" the lack of concentration on one theme, gamemode, level, whatever is so hyperactive that it just bursts my nerves and in the end ends up beeing nothing but busywork. Result: Competently made, grossly obnoxious busywork that you have to be REALLY into to stand for very long.			"

												Reference City Reference XD is like Troy McClure from the Simpsons. You may remember him but that in itself is not amusing.What you end up with is a classic GTA clone in pixel form, which is fine if you buy it on a platform that does not have access to GTA, such as the 3DS.Saints Row series does this type of thing far better because it has its own story that sets up the pop culture gags.

												I want to like this game, because it's right in the wheelhouse of a bunch of thngs that should be fun, but it's totally insufferable and that's sad. Literally all the writing in this game is REMEMBER THAT VIDEO GAME YOU LOVED IN THE OLDEN DAYS HEY HEY GUYS REMEMBER HEY GUYS REMEMBER THAT TIME THE THING HAPPENED HEY WE ARE REMAKING THAT SEQUENCE HERE HEY HEY GUYS HEY THIS IS SO FUNNY HEY GUYS LOL.It's too bad. There's actually the basis of a real interesting game here, but this is the video game equivilant of that guy you know that is about one one-hundredth as funny as he think he is, and it kills the whole thing dead.Also, no remapable controls is an inexcusable PC programming sin at the best of times 15 years ago, never mind now.

												Retro City Rampage would have been the best game ever in '92.  The title pretty much sums it up what to expect. Game is filled with pop culture references of the 80's and 90's. Some of them are funny but not enough to make you wanna play this game.Gameplay it self works fine and cars act exactly like they did on Super nintendo. Everything feels retro as intended: sounds, graphics, menus, effects. There is nothing new this game offers and nowadays there are much better games like this available. I recomend getting GTA 2 (free game) if you like to play a game like this one.  If you want to re-live the glorious pixel world of the past with all its greatness and flaws, this just might be the game for you. Rest of use who has left the past behind: feel free to skip this title.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												Retro City rampage is lacking in both depth and originality and tries to mask it with a retro theme and 80s pop culture references.At its heart it's a GTA clone that is quick to pull you in and then quick to fall flat. The pixel graphics and simplistic gameplay are charming at first but grow tiring in a hurry. The missions and challenges are frustratingly frantic and unbalanced. The jokes are mildly amusing at first but just boil down to a series of references. It's like 'the big bang theory: the game'Just look at the hours played by those who recommended it. Countless positive reviews from those who played 2 hours and then forgot the game existed.Had this come out in the early 90s it would have been amazing. As is, it's a forgettable and mediocre game that leaves you wanting to put it down to play the classics it constantly references.			"

												Pros:- Sometimes funny.- Lots of other game references, so it's fun to see what you can remember.- Very satisfying to run over lots of pedestrians with a combo chain.- Variating missions.Cons:- God awful controls especially when you try to aim. If you want to use a mouse like a normal person, then you still shoot fews seconds after releasing the buttons also if you are moving, you will be still moving in the same direction you started to move while shooting. Dunno how they screwed up like this.- Cops who always try to run over you are going to get on your nerves really quickly. It's possible to evade them, but still very annoying,- Challenges... Oh god... Some are really fun and interesting but there is this stupid thing when devs without thinking or trying themselves give a challenge with idiotic goals. For example sweat bomber challenge. It is a very fun challenge where you are just an exploding person who can propel himself with exploding and travel quickly. Goal for a golden medal - destroy 50 cars in 60s. You have to destroy 1 car every 1.2s. Sounds logical? Especially when cars appear based on rng? Really? 47 cars is my cap. Always at the last 5s cars disappear. It is not hard to destroy those cars, there are not enough cars even when you are flying non-stop.- Last mission... I was going to give this game a 6-7 out of 10 score but after that mission I am sticking with 4/10. Not going to spoil what stupidity went on there but Jesus... Now every time I remember this game, I want to puke. Yay.Conclusion:Don't buy this game. Watch a let's play or walkthrough but don't waste any money on it. After finishing it, you will feel that you wasted ~10h of life for nothing. You will appreciate this game more if you won't be the one playing it.			"

												I didn't play the game much (half an hour? A bit more perhaps?) but I hardly think I will play it again for long, if ever: the graphic is very nice, the music does it's job (until now it has been ok, not superb) but the game has some *very* serious issues with rithm and humor.Humor-wise, it looks like it has been written by a 9 years old, or a bunch of drunken nerds: citations, memes and other stuff *everywhere*, and without style. The authors tried the hardest to stack tons and tons of innuendo, winking at this brand, that superhero, etc, but they did it so just throwing stuff around wihout thought or respite.There is no single line of text that's not a reference to something (a videogames trope, TV, other titles: you name it) and in the end, the result is just a confusing, boring mess. It's like hearing Jon Stewart in fast forward, without pauses between the jokes to enjoy them. And if you think it's cool, think again.Same problem goes with sory and rithm: the missions are rushed and everything seems to go way to fast. After the first 10 minutes you already start skiping dialogues (it's the usual bunch of so-so puns, random objectives, etc, so why care?) and after half an hour you find yourself in a grand theft auto city, but wihout much interest in exploring or doing much.The story jumps from one place to the other without a logic, and the settings are good looking, but logically inconsistent: city -> military base (so far so good) -> underground hi-tech complex (ehm...) -> obstacles run in the same base (wtf?) ). Might be funny for nostalgic of for the kind of people that get all excited at *counting* references (loook! The ninja turtles!!! Look! It's robocop! Look! That's the car of the A-Team...). Everyone else: stay clear...			"

												It's basically a pixel version of Grand Theft Auto. It's certainly playable, but I often feel like games like this are just trying to tug at gamer heartstrings out of some sense of nostalgia. I'm glad I got in in a bundle, because I'm not sure I would have gotten it otherwise. I have no idea what it retails for, but if it's any more than any Grand Theft Auto title, you may as well just get one of those instead.  "

												Retro City Rampage tries to do the whole GTA/Bethesda game/Ubigame thing of being a big open world that you get familiar with by driving around a hub, and that's a pretty modern convention. It also tries to do this while clumsily weilding about what they will assert is a very retro playstyle. The thing is, this ends up being a worst of both worlds scenario, strung with boring and repetitive combat scenarios spread across a pretty uninteresting city, with little motivating you to follow through with the dozens of side missions that show up on your radar. When I did try to do them, they felt like they were repeating the worst parts of the main campaign, which itself was largely juvenile in tone and design. They throw a million expendable cops, thugs, and soldiers your way, with a hundred invisible checkpoints and an infinite supply of lives so that you die a million times (97 by the end in my case) without losing a lot of progress. And I can't help but feel like that blind jab at ""difficulty"" is what they believed would make their game justifiable as ""Nintendo Hard"". RCR is less a game and more a hamfisted, halfhearted, and mostly unfunny collection of cheap references and gags.			"

												RDRDX is a mess, basically a set of games from the NES, SNES and PS1, scattered across the different stages of the ""story"" line, an Arcade where you travel in a GTA 1 like world and pick from the offered games.I can only recommend this game for a person who lived in the NES era, and have fond memories of that time and want to relive it again.Props for the music, the SFX and the rest are just plain boring.

												This game is a good example of why it's important to also check the negative reviews on a game that have a lot of positive reviews.As many others have expressed, this game shoves parodies & references down your throat every single moment and that seems like all the game is good for and even then, it does get annoying especially if you're familiar with all those since it's like- where the hell is the new, fresh content we haven't seen & experienced before?The dev can make an excuse saying it's meant to be a homage to retro games but I think that's cheap if it doesn't have much of it's own content & flair to back that up. I know it's a parody, but at this level it's just plain cheap reuse of existing  ideas & scenarios from other games put randomly in it. That said, it tries hard to be funny but you'd just get a few chuckle here & there. That said, newer gamers who hadn't played the games it's parodying would not get most of the joke and to me, that's bad since like a bad parody (either games, films, cartoons, etc.), it fails to make the joke happen for those unfamiliar with the source material.Moving on, even with the story, parodies & jokes aside, this game is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's just like the most of those pseudo-retro games with retro graphics but in terms of gameplay, it's anything but. Broken stealth system, you can't run at full speed right away after moving from standing still (seriously, not even newer games do this anymore), the game auto aims for you & the Mario-stepping-on-enemies are clunky as hell. I also haven't found a reason to do this when you have other alternatives to kill the enemies. There's also the boring take cover & shoot when the enemy is not shooting & standing there like an idiot waiting to get shot. It happens too often & takes too much time.That said, control is rigid. For a game focusing on rampage, this is totally the opposite experience I'm looking for. If you want a pseudo-retro game that excels in gameplay & still have a touch of their own (as in not being cheap copies of existing games & makes it a 'homage to retro games' as an excuse), get Hotline Miami or Binding of Isaac: Rebirth instead. Those are heaps & bounds better.If I could refund the hell out of this game, I would. Luckily I bought it at discounted price. "

Everytime the action gets going it comes to a halt for the story.Yes if it wasn't for the story it would be too close to GTA 1 but it does feel like there should have been short elegant segways into the plot instead of the classic mistake of coming to a dead stop to explain stuff.

												After the first ten minutes I was done with this game. The game is only kind of fun, but it would be passable if the game was better written, or at least had a general idea of what comedic timing and pacing are. It is CONSTANTLY referencing something. There is no way I will finish this game, because it beats me over the head with references that I pick up on instantly, then continues to pursue the reference just in case I have haven't played the original metal gear games or if I have never seen Back to the Future.

												Avoid this, sure it's GTA style but the missions are dull and they focused too much on the references (I don't wanna keep being told IT EXISTED) and barely a thing original. I do like that the sprites look close to real retro NES the pathetic retro look indie games mostly go for. I can praise the music, as a listener of chiptune I give the music (That they probally choose the cheepest'/free authors who got theirs in a youtube chiptune compilation ) a thumbs up... if the massive amount of overeferencing like Disaster Movie (Which is a DISASTER itself) didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and they just fixed the gameplay, dull missions and original content.

												I want to love this game, I really do.This game is pretty fun, most of the controls are pretty awkward though.Having to use shift to lock on & shoot targets? You can set it to aim with mouse.Pressing ENTER to enter cars and other things? I would prefer E but I got used to it pretty fast.Having to press TAB for switching weapons? NO.The problem (With me at least) with this game is that the weapon switching is way too slow.To give an example, Part 5.The Contraband base.I had INSANE amounts of trouble trying to switch to grenades because enemies kept attacking me, so I would waste 1, ONE GRENADE and I would have to start over because the game only gives you JUST ENOUGH grenades.Now before you say ""Oh but the game is tough!"" well, bad controls do not make a game tougher.Now, outside of this, the game is pretty fun.Hitting people with the cars is silly fun, and the game has tons of references to retro games.But this ONE problem I have with the game makes me want to put it down.Weaponswitching is awful.Please, add an option to let us switch through weapons via 1-0 keys and this game will be playable for me.
