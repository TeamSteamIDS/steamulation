												The same goes for GTR Evolution and RACE 07.This game is eternal. A true masterpiece. 7 years after its release this classical car racing simulation is not obsolete and will never be.GTR Evolution / Race 07 has it all: decent graphics, awesome physics, solid AI and huge content. The game – no, the simulation – is highly customizable. It can thus appeal to both beginners and hardcore simracers.During Steam Sales, this game is simply the best value for money of the entire racing sim universe.What do I need to play a car sim ?Racing wheel is not mandatory. But a game pad is a must. X360 controller works fine.Wait ! 7 years old and counting ? How about online ?The online community is tiny but robust. Anyway brand new sims will soon suffer the same situation.Add-on content ?There are a lot of add-on contents developed by the community. Especially tracks. But generally no setup is provided for the different car types. And it takes skill and time to create a good setup. But fear not ! Even if you stick to the vanilla game, you can enjoy hundreds hours of play thanks to so many tracks and car models.Yet I want add-ons ! Free add-ons !Simbin has released two free DLCs:Formula Raceroom (Formula 1)Andy Priaulx Crown Plaza Raceway (track) "

												Great racing simulator. The feeling and feedback of the cars is very good and direct. You can adjust a lot of things with your setup. You have a lot of different cars like GT and Openwheelers in multiple classes. And with mods you can pimp that up to infinity (Trucks, Karts, Formula One for several years, historic cars.....). Same with tracks. I already tripled my amount of cars as well as tracks just with mods. One special track I have to mention is the Nurburgring Nordschleife wich you get with this addon. Makes a lot of fun and is difficult as (green) hell. Best track ever!!!Just one point of criticism: AI is quite good and hard to beat but cheats on pitstops....so endurance races doesn´t work well...			"

												RACE 07 fans that are craving the ultimate challenge should purchase Evolution if for no other reason than to experience the famous ""green hell"" of Nrburgring. The good news is that the retail box comes with both RACE 07 and Evolution; it's a great value for a great racing game.			"

												This add-on/DLC pack contains ~15 cars each with 5 or 6 skins on average in 3 classes, each with their own championship as well as 3 tracks, all at the Nurburgring in Germany (The Grand Prix layout (~5km), the Nordschliefe layout a.k.a. The Green Hell(~20km) and the Endurance layout which uses half of the GP layout and the Nordschliefe layout(~25km)). The cars are very fun to drive but can be difficult at times, while you will almost definately crash if you attempt one of the longer layouts of the Nurburgring but it improves the game massively (in my opinion). A small extra little thing is the is a slightly different UI which is almost the same but in black and red. As with other add-on/DLC packs this is only accessible by launching the GTR Evo program instead of the Race 07 program(which uses the standard white and blue). If you have a few quid burning in your pocket, I would highly recommend this Add-on/DLC Pack.  PS - please ignore the short amount of time it appears I have used this DLC/add-on pack, this is a glitch which means that only a few seconds in recorded as GTR Evo, which the rest recorded as RACE 07.

												It is a fantastic game in terms of driving, better than GTR2. There is also some graphic improvements. Now, GTR Evo is on. And it is now that I realise that the GT's was THE missing point of Race07. Handling is fantastic, with a 200% forecefeeback enabled. We really feel the road. Perfect! I am really a big fan of GTR2 and made over 5000 laps on it. I must admit, GTR Evo is better... I disagree with the official Czchek review @70%. The GT's are new models and the game with full details (shadows, textures, etc...) is really beautiful. You will have to be very clean with the accelerator pedal with GT pro because the back of your car will go right when you go left... A great pleasure and GTR Evo is not more ""arcade"" at all than GTR2. It is a lie to say this... 10/10 to encourage people who don't know this kind of game. 09/10 to those who have Race 07. 09/10 to those who love GTR2 and would like to know a sharper experience driving. 07/10 to those who think GTR Evo will be a revolution compared with GTR2			"

												A l'instar de Race 07, GTR Evolution (un addon pour Race07) est un simulateur poussé de pilotage. Il ajoute diverses classes de GT aux WTCC existantes, des WTCC améliorées et le circuit du Nurburgring et son Nordschleife, un plaisir de 21 km pour les amateurs de pilotage. Un volant est requis pour s'amuser sur ces titres, et vous ne le regretterez pas. Le multi est bien fait, avec les modes classiques mais bien rendus et la possibilté de faire un vrai week-end de course avec les essais et qualifs. L'IA est de qualité en solo (on a pas les bites d'un GT5 quoi xD). Un excellent jeu pour les fans de pilotage, mais pas pour les fans de NFS arcade quoi.			"
