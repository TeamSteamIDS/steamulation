												Reasonable arcade racer. Controls were a bit twitchy but quite playable with KB or pad and fully rebindable. Screen resolution is limited to 1080p. Surprising amount of cars. Body shop for basic paints and upgrades to your weapons, armor and cars speed. Junkyard for cheap parts, 'supply drops' happen on a timer which contained money and upgrades. NO in app purchases, all free or obtained via cash from racing. Career mode has chapters and online multiplayer option is available. Not a game you will spend weeks playing but I still think it's worth the price. + Steam Achievements please. :) Cheers.

												Android port. The menus suck because they're just ports of the android version, with no options to adjust graphics and they are not fully controller compatible (granted they only claim partial support).Gameplay works well enough with a gamepad. Start menu comes up when you press start, but wouldn't unpause with start. I had to click resume. Anyways the graphics are what you'd expect of an Android port. Late PS2/Dreamcast graphics from 2003 or something. Combat was alright. It felt tactful and impactful enough, but i just can't see myself playing this anymore. Gas Guzzlers, Split Second and Blur do this way better and are far better, deeper experiences.For a buck, sure maybe add it to your library, but objectively despite how cheap it is, i just can't recommend.

												Picked this up for the low low price of free so that's a huge plus going for this game. If you've played mobile games like Asphalt 7 or 8 then you pretty much know what to expect with this game with the added visual flair of cyberpunk avatars and city scapes. It is a bit odd playing a self driving car on the computer (and it turns out that it is on google play for mobile devices) but it really only takes a race or two to get the haing of things. The controls are a bit odd when it comes to stearing most of the time light taps are all you will ever want to do. more often than not if you hold the stick for even a second too long you'll end up plowing into a wall.All in all not a bad little time waster, but don't spend any cash on it as this is unlikely to replace any other racing game you might have.

												Nice racing game that adds weapons to the fun. For 1$ is a steal.			"

												Good game so far, but REALLY sensitive steering. Is there a slider I'm not seeing, or is there no sensitivity option?			"

												Not too bad for a bit of quick fun. Looks like it could get deep...or not.			"

												I'm pleasantly surprised with this game. Seems that a lot of effort has been put into making it, offers a lot of things. Although It's grindy and repetitive it is also enjoyable and addictive. It's a paradox of a game that I grew to love. It's fun, it has great art style, the car models are awesome and there are surprisingly many of them. The weapons are very cool, despite the auto aim, and even the music is great :) The car upgrade system is extremely grindy but at the same time it's quite deep. Beware the game has super sensible steering, so use with caution. It also has automatic acceleration and no breaks, I really hope to see some future updates, like steering sensitivity fixed, optional manual acceleration... but for that price, all I can say is get it now :DDefinitely recommended, and while at it, I hope to see some more mobile ports of combat car racing games, seems this genre has more or less migrated to mobile the last years...  so bring them to Steam :)Edit: I'm now level 22 and I must say the game became incredibly frustrating all of a sudden. It wasn't that hard until now, I didn't expect that! I'm having hard time with my fully upgraded car taka. It feels like it's made of cardboard, while others are made of rock!! One shot you're dead, one crash you're dead, one ram and you're dead... menawhile I can empty my whole weapon into someone and it barely touches their shield...Is it a bug? whatever it is, is crazy unbalanced and unfair! Also once powerful weapons are almost useless now and I have them on level 32.I'm driving full speed I got attached with the plasma blaster, and in 1-2 seconds I am toast, meanwhile I would need to empty like 5 whole plasma blasters with 3 charges each to even destroy someone's shield, it could be a bug, but I don't think so.Also on a side note I had to leave nice cars behind that have grown on me such as the reaper, atom pro and vector, which I have fully upgraded, because they were apparently not powerful enough to compete with others, only to find myself racing against these same ""underpowered"" cars and having them leave me in the dust. Feels like a sick joke. I still recommend this game, for the price and especially for the mazohists.			"
