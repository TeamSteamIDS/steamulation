								Review will update as the game is updated. Still going to review it as a finished game.Good concept, poor execution sofar. Vehicles bounce around like trampolines. Tires don't give traction, they push you away from the object you are trying to climb. Tires ""fall"" between objects that are too close together to fit a tire through. +more annoying stuff. And the vehicles move too slow. I understand it's about trials and not about racing, but it would be fun to open the throttle on practice mode at least.The 'fun::frustration coefficient' is to strongly biased on the frustration side. This game could be LOADS of fun, if/when they fix it.			"

								Micro Trial RC, is about as useful as a ♥♥♥♥ flavoured lollipop, but I have to say at the end of the day; this game is a pure and downright pleasure to quit.10/10 music.			"
