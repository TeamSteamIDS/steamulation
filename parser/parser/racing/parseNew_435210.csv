Early Access Review
								It's unbelievable what you guys have achieved in two months of development. Now starts the long process of fleshing this thing out! What I like so far is that there's a definite sense of potential for core mechanics. You've nailed the sense of speed, worldbuilding, art direction and music, but now it's time to evolve the basic gameplay.I like that there are several things to focus on at once while playing: the tilt of your car (since the surface of the course isn't flat, and you're constantly being thrown off balance), your acceleration (since you'll be overtaken unless you focus on this) and the boost meter (which requires you to keep looking for opportunities to jump or launch yourself in order to flip). These all play off each other pretty well, leading to a pretty deep baseline racing experience. I'm especially glad to see this develop since I was concerned that making a 2d racer would remove a lot of the dynamics that 3d racers/over the shoulder racers present, including collision with other racers and the ability to move horizontally across a track.I'm not sure I'm feeling the power ups right now. I feel like they're pretty straightforward and don't really enhance or change the gameplay in a meaningful way, and that there's an opportunity to come up with some that do. I get what you're going for, and they do feel very Mario Kart. I wonder if there's more to achieve here.The idea of a singleplayer campaign sounds intriguing and different and I'd love to see what you have up your sleeves here. But first I think you should keep tweaking the basic game to make it incredibly replayable; I need to close my eyes and see and hear IRW and feel that addiction. Hope you guys can unlock that over the next few weeks!			"

								I'll be updating this review in the future.At it's core, it's a great, fun game. A concoction of 2D side scroller, high speed racing, physics and power-ups, feels fresh and, dare I say, original. Combination of jumps and boosts, and constant tilting of your car to be at the right angle plays fast and loose. It can be a great multiplayer party game, since it's very easy to pick up and it has that ""Mario Kart feel"" to it, but because of it's physics, this game allows for a surprising amount of finesse and rewards jumping or boosting at exactly the right moment or being at exactly the right angle on landing. And because of that even the single player feels fun and rewarding if you want to learn the game and do some cool tricks.::Pros::-Great core mechanics.-Good mix of 2D physics and racing.-Amazing visuals. Awesome music.-Great sense of speed.-Great camera work. In a 2D game? Yeah. The camera zooms out further the faster you go. So it never feels like you don't know what's coming even on the craziest of speeds.-You can do both back AND front flips! Just think of the possibilities. (and they give you speed boosts :3)::Cons::-Screen shake causes framedrops for some reason. But you can turn it off, so it's not a big problem.-AI is pretty tough if you're just starting.-It's pretty low on content right now, unsurprisingly. It has a pretty good amount of power-ups and racers to choose from, but currently it's only 5 tracks. To be fair, 3 of them were added after the release, so, I'd say, it's updating pretty fast comparatively.I love this game even in it's unfinished state and can only see it getting better in the future.

								This game while unfinished (hence the Early Access) is stupid fun! What it's missing in Content it makes up for in Couch/Local Coop split screen fun. totally worth the the money. I had so much fun I made a video. I tried to make a review instead I got sucked into the fast speed.

								SUCH SPEEDIRW is a butter smooth, hectic 2D racer. Epic sound & graphics. Fantastic sense of speed.Be advised that singleplayer is no fun yet at this point, so bring friends and game controllers.			"

Early Access Review
								2D sidescrolling kart racing. Didn't realize that was a thing I wanted until I saw it. It turned out to be an impulse purchase I didn't regret (which is rare).It looks very promising, but bear in mind it is EARLY access. The developers are at least very up-front about that. The core game is solid, there is just very little content yet. Assuming it gets fleshed out with more worlds, tracks and power-ups, it's well worth $10.Even in current state it would be a very fun party game.			"

								Imagine Mario Kart meets Burnout meets Excite Bike meets Hill Climb Racing meets Rollcage meets Sonic meets Elasto Mania (with a little bit of meeting by even the spirit of Super Smash Bros and Mega Man)No need to imagine things, this is the thing right here you are currently imagining. There is more than meets the eye in this game. Driving has more depth than it seems looking at the gameplay footage.Now imagine a meeting where you play this game, or imagine yourself playing this game at a meeting.We should meet and play this game! (Since there isn't online multiplayer YET, only local)			"

								Promising so far, but very little content.I'll be keeping an eye on it and update my review as it progresses.-----------------------------------A new track was added, bringing the total to 3. The screen-scrambling item honestly makes me not want to play this very much. Hopefully it will be removed or made far more rare in the future.-----------------------------------Screen scrambler has been brought under control, and the bugs are being fixed reliably. There's still some weirdness with powerups (what do all these things do?), and I'd like to see some more tracks and possibly more customization.The AI could use a little bit of variance as well. It seems like they all race near-optimally, so racing against them isn't very exciting because it turns into a combination of luck and not screwing up.My main concern at this point, though, is the low number of tracks, and the lack of a smooth flow between them, a-la F-Zero or similar.Progress overall is good.

Early Access Review
								A really fast side scrolling racing game! While the game is still in early access, the game is a lot of fun in both singleplayer and in multiplayer (only offline for the moment), as making well-timed tricks and boosting through the tracks is very fun!At the moment there is four tracks and 8 playable characters, which is a bit lacking in content for the asking price (but it is early access). While bugs do appear, the developers have been very good at fixing bugs that the players have reported!			"

								I really like what this game is trying to do, but in practice I don't really enjoy it at all. The graphics are fleshed out, the physics and content are all there. One of the most complete Early access games I've played. However, and this is just my opinion, but I don't really enjoy the gameplay. It feels way too chaotic and sporadic, like you're not really in control of your car so much as holding a trigger and watching. It really feels like a mobile game ported over to PC.Thumbs down from personal preference only, I just can't get into it.			"

								Awesome game, it's really promising. I find it hard to win (which is a good thing). Oh and it's quite addictive ! Its still in beta and hopefully they bring out a multiplayer feature because this game is screaming for it!			"
