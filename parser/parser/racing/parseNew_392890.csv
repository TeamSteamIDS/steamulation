I can not recommend this game to anyoneReasons you should avoid it: Boring Gameplay Poor Options Poor Controls (See Descriptions)1. Boring GameplayThe gameplay mostly consisted of driving a difficult to control truck around fairly empty highway. I never got a chance to try the other two gamemodes as I wasn't able to force myself to play that far.2. Poor OptionsThere are a total of 5 different resolutions for this game, ranging from 640x480 to 1366x768. There is no 1080p or options for other aspect ratios. Other settings include a blanket texture quality option (Low Medium High) and shadow quality. Oh, and one last thing; the only time you can change any options is before the game has started. There are no in-game options at all.3. Poor ControlsIt might be better with a controller, but with a keyboard it seemed like the second I hit the arrow keys (Yes, there is no support for WASD) my truck would jerk in that direction. This coupled with the poor performance made it quite difficult to actually complete any levels			"
