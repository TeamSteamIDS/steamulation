												They weren't kidding with ""partial controller support"", triggers does nothing you have to push FWD on the thumbstick - which limits your ability to turn as half a circle is a longer travel than the diameter...I think you'd be able to do as well with a KBD as a controller in this though, no real need for analog steering and you can bind keys on your KBD to have left right on the cursor keys and throttle and brake on two other keys if you want. (it's a Unity game so you can set it in the launcher)This is more for the Trackmania crowd than people who love racing in the form of Forza, I'm sur it's a nice game for people who like that genre, I am not one that does...
