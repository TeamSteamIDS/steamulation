Early Access Review
Pros:+Looks very nice on max graphics, best looking drone sim so far.+Easy to set up with Taranis X9D Tx.+Controls are tight and responsive, and easily customisable.+Fair price point, comes in at half the price of Liftoff ($19.99) and double FPV Freerider ($5).Cons (I understand most of these are because of early access):-Only has a single level at the moment, would love to see more in the future.-No drone customisation (parts, design etc.) besides LED colour. Would also like to see some customisation similar to Liftoff.-I cannot run the game in fullscreen mode, I can only play windowed mode (I have multiple monitors, I think it's messing with the game a little).Suggestions:-I would love to see a free flight mode with an optional god mode to muck around in and not worry about crashing and resetting.-Player made content would be awesome, especially through steam workshop. Players could submit drone part assets, levels, you name it for anyone to use.-A campaign mode, no drone sims as far as I know include a campaign mode. I think the devs could take advantage of this and really set this game apart from the other sims.I can't review multiplayer aspects yet as I have not tried them, feel free to add me if you want to try some multiplayer in the future and I can revisit this review.Overall, it is a great simulator, definitely pick it up and practice with it - it might save you a few real life crashes and save you more than the game cost itself.Looking forward to updates from the developers!

Early Access Review
								Tested around 10 minutes.First feeling : nice graphics. Really love crash animations like IRL.Setup can't be easier with Taranis, tuning is limited but don't like to bother on this usually so it's pretty ok for me.Physics is convicing but still need to be improved. Throttle isn't powerful enough (likely 3S or less).Most of my crashes come from that point.One map only, fun to play with but a bit small, you get LOS quite quickly.Respawn function works great, You restart instantly. No god mode but very friendly at low speed.Would love for next update :- one or two more maps- 4S Lipo flystyle- Recording function (and share a flight on FB for instance)- several frames and spare parts Well done on this one !Time to go back in the game and cut some trees  ;)			"

												Does it fly like legit quads? not really. Does it simulate to the point where it is still very fun? Yes. Would I recomend it as practice for drone racing? not really. Would I recommend it for having fun? definetly.			"

								I love the game, took some time to get the hang of. I wish they would add an option to make your own map, and also have like free mode where you can fly anywhere and do anything like stunts or maybe have a hoop to go through and do stunts through it and practice for the courses. Would be pretty sick. I also fly drones, (in real life) it is pretty much like flying a drone if you have a controller. I highley reccomend this to anyone that wants to fly drones in the future or to know what its like to have a racing drone.			"

												This game used to be alright, before the new update. It felt extremely unrealistic at first, but after playing with the ingame settings for a while I managed to get something that felt alrightish. Now with the new update a lot of those settings are gone, and replaced with ""rates"". It feels like to me that this was a step back rather than forward. This being fixed along with some menu updates, it still could have potential. As of now, I would rather find something else. Unless there is something I've missed, it is now way harder to control throttle especially indoors. (had to enable throttle expo to 2 for it to not shoot into the ceiling on 5% throttle.) It sort of feels like a step in the right direction at some places. And two steps back in others. I miss the settings for weight, and the rates settings, doesn't seem to go high enough, and the roll, pitch and yaw can feel a bit too cinematic at the moment. "

								Fantastic game/simulator. I've never touched a real drone or fpv goggles in my life and I feel much more confident that I at least wouldn't make a fool out of myself if I ever try someone's. And I certainly intend to, because this has really inspired me to give it a shot!I'll leave others to say how realistic it is, as that is a concern of mine, but I must say that it is very well done and looks gorgeous. The developer(s) watch feedback and implement suggestions within days; hopefully this, along with additional content, can keep this game running and make it as popular as it deserves to be.			"

								This simulator has great potential and should work with all standard controllers.Multiplayer works great and fast, graphics are awesome and physics are getting better.Definetly worth a try if you want to race quadcopters.Keep in mind that it <currently> is in a very early stage and needs some feedback to get the physics accurate.

												yeah... should've listened to the warnings^^well at least it looks cooler than the other FPV Racing games^^EDIT:OK that's unfair... this game has some potential and after fiddling with the drag and weight slider a little bit I got it to behave sorta believable... still doesn't come close to the real thing or the realism wee see in liftoff or hotprops for instance.For real FPV Pilots this still can be fun... it's hard and unforgiving and the gates are placed by an evil person^^ If you're looking for a challenge this game is for you^^But if you don't have an FPV Racing or FPV Freestyle background and have no exeprience with flying a quadcopter back off...I also can't imagine to play this with a regular Gamepad.I'd love to see more development as 10 bucks are a hefty price for what feels like a hobby project that is far from completion!

												I had a massive amount of trouble installing this game under Windows 7 64bit. The installer would hang during the UE4 prerequisites installation.After a couple of hours I worked out that BEFORE you try to install this game, You should download and install the following:Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 (NDP461-KB3102438-Web)Visual C++ 2015 redistributable x64 (vc_redist.x64)UE4 Prerequisites x64 (ue4prereqsetup_x64)Make sure to restart windows after each installer.Now the FPV Air Tracks installer should complete sucessfully.I've played this game for about 20 mins and I wasn't so impressed... the Video makes it look much more interesting than it really is. Hopefully it'll grow on me once I manage to get the controls set up properly, which at the moment are terrible. Many other bugs.....Refund pending.			"

Early Access Review
								Does exactly what it says on the tin. Physics are fairly crisp and the courses are challenging. Lacking content, graphical fidelity and UI polish right now but this game will appease many drone enthusiasts. It's got a very high skill curve and I found the stock throttle control was fairly difficult on a PS4 DS controller since it lacks the ability to hold the throttle at a specific value unlike a typical tx. (Have yet to try it with my Dx5e since I need a specific cable). I wouldn't recommend this game at all for someone wanting to just use a KB/Mouse.Overall I think for the $12 price this is a no brainer for anyone looking or interested in trying drone flying without the larger investment or worrying about crashing. Right now content is extremely limited, which does question is longevity, but I think if the devs are consistent with updates this game could be a fantastic sandbox for drone enthusiasts in the future.Things i'd like to see:UI improvements; it's blocky and messy in places (yes it's EA, but it needs more consistency)Drone customization, props, motors, batteries, flight controllers etc in addition to the weight/power sliders in settingsLess dependence on 'set' courses/maps and a 'random' or 'seeded' option that mixes up the gate locations each time. All levels quickly become stale after you race them a few times.Workshop integration; drone skins, custom maps/level generator			"

												Looks cool in the trailer but sadly there are so many things rendering the game unplayable.Why doesn't it fully support a XBox 360 controller? The sticks seem to work not quite right. Next thing is the camera... The game is all about speeding drones, so why is the camera bugged? It stays focussed at the drone's left side making the game unplayable. I even tried out the other camera modes: While the first person mode won't even work, there is a perspective which is supposed to be on drone's center, but is also rotated by 90 degrees, so you'll always be presented with what's happening on the right side of your drone -.-""Sorry developers. It's a very nice idea but I can't recommend this game in its current stateI guess it was also supposed to cost around 20$ when it first came out, that's why I put it on my wishlist back then...

												This sim has a pretty steep learning curve if you use an xbox controller (I ended up needing to attach magic marker lids to the joysticks with rubber bands to get a longer lever for more precise control). The game could use some more levels and a better UI but all things considered, it's a blast and a great way to learn drone controls.			"
