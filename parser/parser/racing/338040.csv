IntroductionBears Can't Drift!? is developed by Arran Langmead and published by Strangely Named Studio. It could’ve been a promising kart racer if it wasn’t bogged down by the troublesome control scheme and lack of a proper options menu. GameplayI really wanted to give this game a fair shot. I have relatively few racing titles in my Steam library, compared to other genres. Even less so, related to cuddly animal-driven karts. It is cute indeed but I cannot judge a game based solely on its looks. As soon as I started the game, I was baffled to find next to no way of actually seeing what graphical changes can be done or even an in-game glossary of the key bindings. All it showed were the symbols off console controllers and as soon as I pressed the ESC key, the game simply closed down and I was back to my desktop. Bears may drift, but we got off on the wrong foot right over there, buddy. I decided to let that one slide since I really did enjoy the near-minimal looking art style, the diversified scenery and even the number of bears/racers you can choose from. But I was taken aback soon enough when I tried playing on Bears Can't Drift!? Hard Mode. You see, once you start up the game, instead of going to the Hub (as the developer calls it) and selecting a bear and game world, you have to choose the difficulty by actually reaching a hub with your red kart (too bad you can’t change its color too). The Easy and Normal stages are a breeze, but lemme tell you of the Hard one. I tried for at least 20 times to jump off a cliff and reach the other side, only to crash less than a meter away from my target. That’s all it took. If only that cliff was taller. Still, I play on Normal on almost all my games so I had to settle for it. I made the right call, since the driver AI was very responsive and quite feisty. Absolutely nothing wrong in it. I throughly enjoy good AI in my racing games. Speaking of the Game Worlds I mentioned earlier, you can choose between Woodland, Asian and Arctic settings. Each filled with racing opportunities, time trials or a sort of picnic collection type of game which I presume would be enjoyable, if you play with 3 of your friends (we all know how well Mario Kart treated friendships, right?). Truly, the racing part of the game feels great if you overlook the inability to set your own controls. It even features power-ups to help you speed up or hinder your rivals during the race. It is only a decent title and that is what bothers me most. It could have been much better with what I perceive as, minor adjustments. I’m going to be a little technical now. My apologies if I will bore you with some details. The game has an atrocious options “panel” with overly simplistic settings which you cannot actually tweak. You might think I’m exaggerating but I had to inspect the screenshots I took for this title, in order to know what resolution it runs. 2194x1234. Ironically, this weirdly out of standardized proportions resolution is seen as 1920x1080 in-game and even then it does not allow me to change it in any manner, lowering or increasing. I’m not going to beat my chest over absolutely having to play the game at 4K (though I did attempt several ways, even by Set Launch Options and /width=3840 /height=2160), but it did have the option for 2K natively (2560x1440). Totally useless though since it never actually changed it in-game. Great job dev team! Pros+ Beautiful graphics+ Decent racer AI+ Steam Achievements Cons- In-game settings and the control scheme are a bad joke- MP limited to LAN/splitscreen- No Steam Trading CardsResult / Final thoughtsBears Can't Drift!? feels like it never left Early Access. Not having rebindable keys and with a barebones settings menu, can be considered almost sins as far as PC video gaming is concerned. It’s also known as a “bad console port” but the funny thing is, the PS4 version for this game has been even more critically panned. If the racer AI wouldn’t have been decent and if the game didn’t use the Unreal Engine 4, I might have rated the game below 60 and thus stop recommending altogether. In truth, even if I read on its store page that it had its final update on June the 1st 2016, nothing is really “final” in gaming. Not when you have to make things right. So, never say “never”.Rating 60/100 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of RedHill. "

What is Bears Can't Drift!?Bears Can't Drift is a kart racer that is set in a stylised world and is heavily inspired from Diddy Kong Racing. Players take control of bears and race across a variety of tracks and game modes with up to four players in a split-screen game. Four game modes are available to be played. These include time trial, single race, and checkpoint. As a result of these modes being used in countless other racing games, they are self-explanatory.The fourth game mode, I'm not certain what they've called it, or really what the objective has you eat power-ups to fill up a power-up bar. I have yet to try this in the multiplayer mode. However, in the single-player mode, I filled up my bar and attacked the opposition. It isn't entirely clear what is supposed to happen or what you are supposed to do. An attempt to attack a single enemy mercilessly never eliminated them. Allowing the AI to attack me and empty my own bar never 'killed' me. Racing around the track six consecutive times didn't bring a possible 'race' to a close. Consequently, some clarification on this mode is necessary.A key feature of the game is a hub world. Players must navigate this hub world to get to the next event. This is one of the features that frustrates me most of all.The Disappointing Hub WorldUnfortunately, I am disappointed in the hub world. It has copied the idea from Diddy Kong Racing and I wish that they hadn't. The gimmick may have worked almost two decades ago in an almost flawlessly designed racing game but it doesn't satisfy the needs of players today. Therefore, I argue that it is outdated. Many gamers desire a streamlined experience that they can get into and out of as quickly as possible. Because of this, we appreciate having menu systems that enable us to do this. As a result, the hub world is mentioned in many negative reviews as well as positive ones.I  can appreciate that some people may enjoy the hub world. It would seem like a possible solution would be to incorporate a menu system as well as having the hub world. This would satiate the desires of both sets of players - those who enjoy the hub world and those who don't. A menu system would enable players to get into the actual events faster while those who enjoy the menu systemSingle Player? Forget About It!If you are a single player and do not have friends or family to play with then I strongly advise that you do not purchase this game. I have two very strong reasons for this.Firstly, in the non-race modes, there are no other race cars on the track. As a result, the race tracks feel like big empty space and consequently it feels very lonely. Further, there was no sense of competition whatsoever. If the intention of the developers was to have the single-player on a track by themselves attempting to get the fastest possible time then Steam leaderboards needed to be incorporated. That they are not is almost unforgivable.Secondly, when it comes to the competitive modes the AI is relatively useless. I am accustomed to having to duel it out with the computer AI. Other race games are able to have competitive AI even if it means the dreaded utilization of rubberbanding code. When you breeze by your opponents on the first or second corner of the race and are never headed again it gives your game a bad look. Even worse than this is when you overlap them on the second lap and they are either running into corners, performing donuts or occasionally not even driving in the right direction.Ultimately, if you are looking for a strong single-player racing game there are better alternatives on the market.Local Multiplayer? Right On!Although I am disappointed in the single-player mode the opposite holds true if you do have friends. This is where the game was intended to deliver and it does a pretty solid job. Playing with only Ainslie still made the game feel a little empty. However, playing with a group of 4 competitive gamers brought the game to life. This made the game feel a lot like Mario Kart and the like. As a result, it is genuinely a game where the more players you have (it supports up to 4) the better your experience.We were able to laugh and talk trash as we all attempted to outdo one another. The game, as cute as it is, does become very competitive in a group setting. When you have two or three players who are on your level - or better - you strive to keep getting better. The worst of our group claimed at the end of gameplay that they didn't feel left out and that they improved more than they had in other games because they were truly enjoying themselves. In our last race, they were able to come second instead of lagging miles behind.Is it Steamified?There are no Steam Trading Cards as of yet. There is, however, a set of 21 Steam achievements.If I were to improve the game for Steam I would definitely add Steam leaderboard to the game especially if there are no plans to include online multiplayer.VerdictBears Can't Drift!? is a game that I cannot recommend for single-players looking for a competitive racing game. However, if you have multiple friends or family members who can and will play the game with you then it is recommended. Ultimately, there better games out there but for a local multiplayer game, this does represent reasonable value for money.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways, including PC hardware, please visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

Early Access Review
								So far I like the idea of the game. BUT!!!....Pros:-Graphic are Eye Candy. Looks great, runs great.-Controls niceCons:-repetitive soundtracks that are easily forgettable. (Ice world has a glitched forest world track playing too.)-BS collision physics that make you lose ALL MOMENTUM when you collide into another kart.-Some courses are not properly made for hard mode's speed-Some boundary boxes are too low off the tracks which can cost you your place as well as that game.-quiet sound effects-generic, yet cute characters-No sound options-Pointless hub that tries to be a diddy kong racing mimic. Honestly I'd rather have the option for a quickstart menu like in DKR64.-always starts in window even after setting changes.I will continue to play this game, and hope my perspective can change! "

								A very promising game! Firstly, it looks beautiful. The world and characters have a very charming aesthetic.Even in early access, the game is very fun to play. There are 4 powerups to use against your opponent. You may also combine different powerups together in different ways to create new weapons.If you'd like to see some 2 player gameplay and a more in-depth look at the game, check out this video:

												This game has lots of potential, and i purchased it assuming the complaints in the negative reviews had been fixed by this point. notice this review is march 2017. the issues are not fixed. i refunded due to multiple bugs, the worst of which is the game randomly deciding it wont recognize player 2's inputs, regardless of controller or port, working one second, and then not the next. there are other glaring issues as well that i figured the developers would have worked on, and they havent, including no proper menus or tutorial, no mini maps, no proper anything. hell, you will spend your first 30 minutes just trying to figure out how to select game mode, map, how to connect player 2, all the simplest ♥♥♥♥ that could be done in 2 seconds with a regular menu. they make you drive around a gigantic map, driving through ""option"" portals and ""option"" pickups that are not labeled, or even modeled after what youd expect the option to look like, and senselessly spread around, its insanity. the devs are not interested in listening to the community, the game has potential, but everything else causes it to be a NO BUY from me. try if you like, but you will quickly request a refund. it really is as bad as the other negs say.

Early Access Review
								Bears Can't Drift!? bears a decent resemblance to N64 classic Diddy Kong Racing but this is definetly not a negative. The game has an over world which connects different tracks and currently there are 3 different game modes. Single Race which, as you would expect, pits you against up to 7 other racers, time trial which does as it says on the tin and a picnic basket mode where you must be the first to collect picnic baskets that keep spawning around the track.Graphically the game looks lovely running on the Unreal 4 engine and so far the developer has put in some different looking tracks. A little bit more “stuff” on each track would be nice but I am sure this will come as the game continues through early access. That’s not to say each track does not have shortcuts as there are some great ones on show here both of the official through a hollow log type and unofficial take a sharp turn over the edge and few a through trees type. Currently going offtrack does not seem to slow you down and I actually really like this mechanic as it makes the traces a lot more fun and frantic. Powerups in the game are the usual variety of missiles, speed boosts and traps but all function well and seem to have a decent impact on the races. Where the game really excels is in the powerup fusion mechanic. Picking up 2 powerups allows you to combine them to create a second tier power up. I love this mechanic and think this could definetly be a selling point moving forward.In terms of controls the game as you would expect plays best with a controller and handles well. The drifting took a little bit of getting used to but after a few races I quickly adapted as the “feel” is very different to Mario Kart. Local multiplayer works really well and definitely is enjoyable and I really hope somewhere down the line online multiplayer is a possibility. While there is clearly a fair bit of development to do “Bear’s can’t Drift” is being developed by a sole person in Arran Langmead and when talking to the man in question you can tell how much of a passion project this game is. While it obviously has a long way to go I reckon this could become one of the best kart racing games out there when it is finally finishd.To watch our video review please click on the link here:  Video Review[www.thegametutor.co.uk] "

Early Access Review
								Bears Can't Drift is a local multiplayer game, that's based on a smiliar concept of crash team racing, which allows you to play up to 4 players split screen on your monitor. Be aware, this game supports controllers and keyboard by pressing Q.The game it self is interesting and has a fun concept with it Bear idea. The whole game is beautiful of it's use of UE4 engine. On the bad hand, you cannot change your resolution for your highest,While driving around, you have 3 flags of game types which is, Lab's for the best time, Labs for beating everyone with weapons to be nr.1, and collecting all food in baskets. While using weapons, you can max collect 2 weapons or boosts to fight your enemies. For some etc, you have speedboost, shield, traps, rockets, which you cannot shoot backwards. The maps have traps and secret ways to get through so you also get in first line.The drifting part is a little bit strange because of the high amount of speed boost you get by using it. In the beginning i didn't even used it, and thought ""Why is it even here?"". So far it's positive effect is do get first in line quicker. So, if you are missing Crash team Racing, and need a cuter style with bears local with 4 friends split screen on your machine, then this game is for you.Here is a demo:

												The game looks nice visually, however, the gameplay in combination with the menu screens, music, and sound effects almost seem incomplete. The game feels like it should still be in early access. The multiplayer feels tacked on, but at least is a nice addition. The game has potential, but I would not recommend it at this time. I would want to see more updates and fixes to the game in terms of it's polish. The game feels like Diddy Kong Racing, but suffers without a story explaning why there is a hub world (and the lack of a menu screen to select levels). At $12.99, I would not recommend this title sadly.			"

								Really fun game to play with a friend, especially if you enjoyed some of the karting games of the 90's (or later).  Have switched to playing this for a bit of karting fun instead of playing Mario Kart 64.  Takes a while to get used to the lack of any real text, still not sure if I like that part, but that's one mans opinon.  Online multiplayer would be nice, but I'm lucky enough to have a partner for local co-op games, and lets face it, this type of game is infinately more fun to play with friends =]			"

Should you play this?Yes/NoIf you have friends to play it with, go ahead get it. It's fun with friends, but not alone.A quick summary:Mario Kart meets We Bare Bears meets Diddy Kong Racing. A beautiful kart riding game where you and your friends play as bears and race against each other. Pros:+The game is insanely beautiful+Kart riding controls very well (most of the time)+You can play locally with up to 4 of your friends!+Supports the Xbox controller+Stack power ups to get enhanced versions of your power up+ I've found hidden items in some of the levels suggesting there are items to find. Gives the game tracks replayability to find and collect all the hidden items.+ You can customize your bear, accessory and kart color!+""Battle"" mode is also an option if racing gets stale +/- This is both a pro and con but more a pro, I guess: The game uses a hub overworld but fails to add a quick menu for players who don't want to drive around just to get to a specific level.+ Some tracks have alternate paths..? I at times veered off the road but still ended up at check points, suggesting that I might have taken a different path that could have been intended.Cons:-The ""options"" are just pictures and is limited to v-sync, resolution, graphics level (low, medium, and high, I think?) and Windowed mode-For the most part, once the AI falls behind, they'll probably never catch up. There seems to be a lack of rubber banding to make the game challenging and the AI sucks so it makes the game too easy as it is. Perhaps this could be fixed with an AI patch instead.-For the battle mode, there's no indication for what you need to do-The music got repetitive but this could just be a personal gripe-The power ups seem unoriginal and can't be thrown backwards like in Mario Kart. Small con, I know, but it's an option that's nice for when you're playing with friends. :')- There's no indication for what to do when you enter ""battle"" mode. - Weird glitches at times- There's no mini map or anything to understand where the tracks start or end or where you're supposed to go...- The game just feels like an early access game still.Long reviewBears Can't Drift!? is a cute and gorgeous kart racing game that supports up to 4 players locally. Looking at it from just a gameplay stand point, the game is pretty good. The controls are good, for the most part, with occasional freak outs that make you drift in the wrong direction. That being said, when the drift mechanic works, it's a really solid mechanic. One issue I have with it though, is that it performs similarly to the drift mechanic in Kart Rider except in Kart Rider, drifting fills up your boost meter so good drifts feel good to do since they reward you with a boost while in this game, drifts work as they should, but don't really reward you much over a player who didn't drift.The tracks are long and fun (when there's a challenge). Also, the three worlds you can choose are unique and different enough from each other that they feel like entirely different worlds when you play on themThe game has three modes: Race, ""Check point"" (battle) and Time Trial. Race mode is fun but the AI never catches up once you pass them, so it's pretty easy to win once you pass them since they always take the same pathing (even if there are items there) but the mode really shines when you play with friends. The races become frantic and there are enough choke points and paths so that anyone can pass the top player if they out perform them which can keep games from feeling like complete stomps. The game could benefit from better items for players in last place, though. This would allow them to catch up or be on slightly more even footing with better players. In battle mode, you and your friends (because the AI is awful at this mode and isn't worth playing with) fight to see who can fill their food meter the fastest. Hitting enemies with an ability causes them to drop food which you can then pick up. This mode is much like the gourmet race from the Kirby games. Going into this blind, I had no idea what was happening due to the lack of menus, texts, etc. Time Trial is exactly what you would expect. You race through levels of the game by yourself to try to get the best time possible for that track. The only issue is that there's no leaderboards for this game so you're essentially just racing against yourself and that's it. In a game with no online multiplayer, it's a shame they don't at least have a leaderboard. Adding a leader board (and maybe even ghost data) would make time trials much better.Overall, the game has a LOT of potential. It's gorgeous, the controls are pretty tight although they can be improved and mechanics could be added to make the game more complex while keeping it casual (charging up your boost meter by drifting please!), and the maps are fun when you play with people, but ultimately, the game's menus, or lack of them, lack of content and repetitive music, along with the other complaints in the review keep it from being a game I can recommend. Only buy it if you have friends or family to play it with.If I had to sum up the entire game in one sentence, it'd be: ""Is this game supposed to be finished?""It just doesn't feel done. It's not bad, just incomplete.Gameplay:

												so i bought this to chill with a few friends while we were drinking. from what i could tell it seemed like a maria kart-type game... which it is. However, i found it immensely bad. there's no in game menu, you have to drive through portals to choose everything from difficulty to world and maps. there is no tutorial, which isn't too bad as it's a simple game, but you need to spend the first few minuttes figuring out how to chose the game mode you want and stuff like that. Also, when racing the races you dont have a mini map. this might seem like a simple thing that could be added, but i feel like it made it really difficult to see what direction you need to turn sometimes. the maps look open world, but are farely linear, so you don't NEED a minimap but it would be nice. However, if you do get confused enough to drive in the actual opposite direction of the rest of the players then the game won't tell you. It will just have you drive through the map in the wrong direction untill you figure it out for your self. Granted, i only spent 45 minuttes in the game before requesting a refund but i really didn't want to waste another minutte in there			"

Early Access Review
								As a long time MarioKart fan I'm always on the lookout for similar karting fun on non-Nintendo platforms, and Bears is definitely fun, even at this early stage in its development.While taking care not to tread on Nintendo's famously letigious toes, Bears provides more than enough charm, innovation and polish to push all the right kart game buttons. While the tracks could do with a bit more signalling (turn here!>>>>>) they are all characterful, challenging and visually appealing. The game looks beautiful.The sensation of speed is keenly felt and the peril, provided by cheeky AI bear bots (friends if your lucky enough to have some) is enough to keep you on your toes.I can't wait to see how the game progresses. I'll be drifting around those corners just like bears can't until the next update...			"

								Clearly an example of Early Access done right. As has been mentioned by other reviewers it resembles popular cart racers of the 90s - I wouldn't know since i played practically none of those. What I do know is that it's fun to play; it looks and feels quite polished already. The sense of speed is definitely there and drifiting is seamlessly integrated. What's currently missing is some more in-game orientation with regard to game modes and, more importantly, online multiplayer support. I hope these will be implemented down the road.Also, bears rule.			"

												Get it on sale if you like fun little games. It is incredibly cute so great for small kids. Don't expect mario kart or Donkey Kong racing though. This is an indie game and is fun for split screen. The cons are things that could be fixed, but there is a lack of settings, lack of explanation, and lack of content. However, I like it.

												The trailer got me excited, it's hard to find local multiplayer games these days. I stopped playing soon after starting because I was annoyed and a little bored. There appears to only be three different pickups during races, a wind shield, rockets, and a bee nest. The computer players are really easy to defeat and playing alone you spend the entire game in first with little effort.The game honesty feels like it's geared for kids. Firstly, the menu is over simplified with pictures instead of words and there are only 4 ""settings"". Resolution, general quality 1-3, windowed/fullscreen, and another that said ""V"". I wasn't sure what the ""V"" one was for. I just wanted to change the sound options because the sound effects seem so quiet. That's the second thing, all I hear is music and items wizzing by; the karts seem almost silent. There is no menu to allow for hopping  in and out of races. Instead, you have to drive around one of three world hubs that each contain portals to various maps for that world hub. There are only 3 game modes and I don't believe you can even change the difficulty.I downloaded it because I wanted to get into the local multiplayer but was turned off enough to feel compelled to write this review before I've even had the chance to play locally. I would imagine local play is a lot more fun, especially with 4 players. The computer players on the other hand are mindless.			"

								The game is beautiful, interesting and downright adorable! However, I had no idea what I was doing or what my objectives were. I would reccommend having a Main Menu with different game modes and a settings option, additionally having text to identify what the pictures mean in the settings menu. The reasons I am saying this is that when I loaded up the game for the first time it dropped me in the middle of a field expecting me what to do with little direction of what I needed to do or where I needed to go. It then drops you into another massive field after entering a portal (it just makes no sense). The game obviously needs improvments but I do understand its a work in progress. I look forward to seeing how this game turns out, it has great potential :D			"

								this is a pretty fun game. I wish the ruins area wasn't so long though :Pthere are a few bugs but that is to be expected on early access. I recommend it! it reminds me of mario cart and I really like that. Note to the developer: copy some of mario karts really cool racing ideas :D			"

								This Game is Pretty awesome, Since It is early access it is a little bit buggy, getting stuck in walls and such, I have High hopes for this game and I would love to see an online type gamemode where you can race other players online, Custom Bears and carts would be awesome aswell! Needs a story, I felt purposeless I needed something to achieve, racing was fun but there needs to be a higher goal! 7.8/10			"

								For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wondered… Can a Wild Bear drift a racing car?Were it not for Strangely Named Studios’ aptly named Bears Can’t Drift!? I may never have known!GameplayThere is no story to follow in this game, it’s just straight up gameplay. From the main menu you are thrust into a ‘Hub’ level. As the name suggests, this is where you will be spending most of your time during this game. From here, you can access each individual level, change the gameplay mode, change the colour of your bear and add other players – or if you so wish, you can simply drive around at your own leisure!You have the option to play on of three different game modes at the moment, Single Race, Time Trial and Checkpoint.Single Race and Time Trial should be fairly self-explanatory. Single Race puts you up against 11 other racers as you complete a basic three lap race over varying race courses. Time Trial is similar, however there are no other racers! It sees you take to the race track on your own as you try and record your fastest laps possible.This brings us to the final mode: Checkpoint. Contrary to the name, this is not a checkpoint based race mode. Checkpoint is essentially a Battle Arena game mode where you compete with other racers to gather the most picnic baskets with whoever fills their food-meter, and thus become the fattest bear, first being the victor. Think something along the lines of Mario Kart’s Balloon Battle, but instead of just destroying the other racers balloon, you take it off them.There are 4 different pickups provided in each game mode too, your standard speed boosts and weapons to cause trouble to your opponents. Nothing too different here in this, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing – there are only so many items you can have in a kart racer!Each of these modes can be played with AI opponents and up to three friends, with BCD!? supporting up to 4 player splitscreen. As of writing this review, this is the only form of multiplayer as developers Strangely Named Studios have yet to add in an online multiplayer mode. It is worth noting however, that this is still a game in development. With this in mind, it is highly possible we might see this feature added in the future. Bears Can’t Drift!? still makes for an extremely fun party game however, thanks to its addition of local multiplayer – something that until recent years seemed to be dying a slow death.GraphicsBears Can’t Drift!? was developed using the Unreal Engine 4, one of the most powerful and visually impressive game engines on the market. As such, this game looks incredible. Even running on my mid-range gaming PC, this game looks better than most of other games currently sat in my Steam library.In ConclusionOverall, this game is definitely worth checking out. As mentioned before, this game is far from being finished, but what we do have right now is more than enough to suffice – especially when you consider its cheap price tag.Splitscreen Multiplayer is where this game shines, and it can provide hours of fun for a group of friends.I actually had the chance to meet the developer at the recent Eurogamer Expo in Birmingham, UK and he assured me much more was to come!Overall, 8/10. A must buy if you enjoy local competitive multiplayer.			"

												instructions (or a page to link to instuctions) would be nice... but, if you're an old-school Mario-Kart fan, this is up your alley.  The only thing that would make this better: if it was called Hamsters can't Drift. 23% better, at least. :-)			"

												You'll take at least 15 minutes to select the highest difficulty before discovering that the whole game is very precise in a way that if you touch a wall you f-ed up! The walls in this game are bouncy and there are places where you'll just bounce from a wall to an other if you're not careful. This is a terrible mechanic to have in a kart game or any kind of racing game so I really can't recommend the game mostly because of this one thing that ruins pretty much the whole game for anybody who doesn't have time and patience to learn a game that's not really that fun			"

								Okay, the game looks beautiful but it's a very demanding game on older hardware. I have a desktop PC that just barely meets the recommended specs and I only get 25-30 fps with stuttering and frame drops below 20 fps. The tracks are really short and not much happens on it, you only get to see a lot of trees. You can combine powerups, but I did not find this mechanic that engaging on these boring tracks. You're better off buying Sonic Racing Transformed or even F1 Race stars, these kart games offer far more content and variety. Since there is only one developer working on this game, I don't expect it to improve a lot. Very expensive for what it offers, I mean if it was 5 bucks I would not complain.			"

												Awesome Kart Racer which embodies the look and feel of Crash Team Racing while managing to maintain it's own personality. Hard to believe that this game has been developed by one person, and I look forward to seeing what he does with the final release.			"
