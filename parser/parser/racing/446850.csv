My Thoughts:A game you can play with your mind, but I cheated and used a gamepad  ;)This game reminds me of a hover racer..... but with friction, fun tracks, gameplay requires time to master and I love the music!Game Details:Race the ball through the handmade unique colorful sci-fi tracks, bump into walls, avoid laser beams and jump from platforms up to new levels. Use power ups to craft your racing strategy, push, collide and wipe out your opponents. Play with keyboard, controls OR a headband and just focus - no hands!			"
