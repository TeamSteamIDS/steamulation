Early Access Review
Introduction RC Simulation 2.0 is the latest RC simulator to hit the Steam store. RCSIM2 offers cars, boats and quadcopters for use on default tracks as well as user-made tracks. As this is an RC simulator it is of course geared towards people who have at least some interest in RC vehicles, if you don’t fit that profile, this game and therefore this review, probably won’t be for you. It’s worth mentioning while I do enjoy RC sims and I do have an interest in the vehicles themselves I’m not hugely knowledgeable about them.Presentation RCSIM2 may not have ground-breaking graphics but what it does have are good enough to enjoy the game. The vehicle models are all high quality which of course is the most important part of the game’s presentation as an RC sim. One thing about the game’s presentation that I particularly liked was that, as there is an onboard camera for the vehicles, some of the vehicles have lower quality cameras compared to the third person view, such as on the smallest quadcopter in the game, just added a nice touch of realism for me.Gameplay RCSIM2 can be enjoyed in four ways, five if you count the map editor.First up, we have Practice mode. This is pretty self-explanatory, you choose a vehicle and then select a map you wish to test out. The only limitation here is that boats cannot be used on maps without water which is pretty obvious. Once you’re actually in the game you’re free to explore the map as you wish, the checkpoints and lap markers do work so you can actually complete proper laps and check your time for them if you wish to improve your times for time trials or multiplayer.Next we have the Time Trial mode. Once you’ve selected your vehicle and track you’ll be given a short warm-up time to get a feel for the track (this can be skipped if you’d rather get straight to the action). You’ll then be given a set amount of time, three minutes, to complete as many laps as you can as fast as you can. Obviously the amount of laps doesn’t matter, it’s your time which is important, but your fastest lap will be used so don’t just sit there and do nothing after your first lap!Multiplayer is the next mode on our list. Multiplayer basically allows you to do whatever you want. You can race against your friends in any RC vehicle or you could have a quadcopter paintball dogfight against your friends! I know which one I’d choose.The final proper game mode is the Challenge mode. From what I’ve seen of it the aim of this mode is to shoot a certain amount of balloons using a paintball gun. This mode requires a vehicle with a paintball gun as well as a map that has balloons floating around.As I mentioned earlier, RCSIM2 also has a track editor (it will eventually have a vehicle editor too). Now I’m not particularly good at using an editor in any game but I did check out RCSIM2’s, I must say it looks incredibly good. You’re given all the tools you need to build whatever track you want. You can change how big the map itself is, you can choose what terrain you want to use and then of course you have access to spawn points and all of the objects in the game. Once you’ve created your track it can be uploaded to the Steam workshop for other people to use. The idea is to create your own tracks and share them (though the game does come with some tracks made by the dev) and so this is obviously a very important part of the game.There are of course other things I need to mention regarding the gameplay but I’ll keep it short and snappy. RCSIM2 has a full day and night cycle and you’re able to choose whatever time of day you want, though there’s currently no weather in the game. There are eight different camera angles for you to use including a first person camera that allows you to move yourself around, it’s worth mentioning the controls for the gamepad don’t work properly for the first person view and controlling your RC is pretty much impossible in this camera view, it’s mainly just to position yourself. The marshals in the game have ragdoll physics, it’s pretty silly but it can be rather fun to just run them over with your RC or shoot them with a paintball gun every so often in practice mode.Miscellaneous The RC physics seem realistic to me.The sound effects are reasonably good but from what I’ve read on the forums and other reviews from people who have a better knowledge of RC vehicles they could use some improvement.Most of the settings aren’t implemented yet, for now you just get a generic quality level for graphics and input options.In regards to input options, you can use KB&M (not recommended), an Xbox 360 controller (or any other kind of controller that works with windows) and of course, since this is an RC sim, you can use proper RC controllers if they have a USB connector.There’s not a huge amount of content at the time I’ve written this review but as it progresses through development and more people start making and uploading their own tracks the amount of content will increase. Verdict Worth Purchasing. RCSIM2 is a solid RC simulator that any fans of the genre should try. It’s reasonably realistic, the RCs themselves look good and it will only get better as it develops. As I said earlier, this game probably isn’t for your average gamer but if you like RCs then you should pick it up or at least follow its development.Review Copy Provided. No drama, Just Reviews.El K.			"

Early Access Review
								Good game all around. As a simulator it is doing its job to simulate the Rc world. I have messed around with the track editor and it is a strong feature of the game and was a smart idea to put that in during the period of early access when actual content is low currently.Now for the dreded complaints, but wait lets first talk about what my complaints are. My only things that I think needed improvement on in the game are things that are fine to have when your game is in early access. The main one being a lack of overall game options for configuring the game to work best, and thats fine the creator is working on them so its not that big of a deal. So with that being explained that I won't go into detail about my complaints because they don't matter at this point of a new early access game.Something I would love to see implamented is some kind of a driving tutorial. just one level to help those new Rc drivers who this is their first time playing around with a realistic Rc driving mechanics (like the sharp turning and the quick accel). That and I think it would be cool if there could be a car editor tool (not configuring the mechanics) but like creating bodies so  you could have that personalized look. That could be cool but I don't think that needs to be a priority since I would rather see more polish and configurations of the base game.I give this game a 7/10 only because this game is early access and needs to be worked on (something that is happening so I feel that when I review this again later on that 7 will become a 9)			"

								Only played a bit so far, but from what I've already experienced, combined with the quick support from the developer:Pro's:- Already a great sim for the true RC fanatic, eventhough it's still in it's starting shoes, it is great fun.- Physics engine seems to be well made and has great potential.- Netcode seems great. (In the first hour I've tried some multiplayer (without opening ports) and even with Europe>USA seemed quite good)- Generally fun for all ages, especially when running over Larry :)- Eventhough the content is few, already great variety in content.- Sandbox/Track-Editor this is an option that stands out, it's already working great and this also has great potential.- Great controller support, any game like this should have it this way.Neutrals / Tips:- Audio/Sounds, the voices are already quite well, but I do think the vehicular sounds are up for improvement.- More information in-game with the Track Editor. (It took me a while to figure out the track needs all 5 checkpoints, for a lap to be a lap).- For the Track-Editor to have an option to make long ""strokes"" of the same terrain paint to make straight lines.Cons:- Staying really objective I can't see any cons.

								I must say for being in Early Access stage of development. This RC Sim is packing a lot of potential, and I can't wait for what's too come. For starters there's a lot of unique and new ways to be immersed into the experience. From seeing bugs flying around lights at night in a realistic way, to the day and night cycling, and the fact there's rag doll models for the other randomly placed people. I think that those small yet inventive aspects could really show the other more expensive RC sims how to be fun and entertaining without the need of extensive experience in RC vehicle handling. I really can't wait for what's coming up in the next set of updates, but I'm sure  ""Devotid"" will live up to their name and really provide something special for RC sim players and just gamers alike. Thank you for giving me my dream hobby back Devotid, and may all the future updates and added content gleam in your efforts.			"

Early Access Review
								Do you like the idea of VRC, but dislike the lack of content, platforms, vehicle options, and the ability to use usernames over your real name? I need to stress that this is nothing as like vrc's simulation as this feels more like a game, vrc's simulation is very sim like and it feels a lot closer to the real thing. I'm not knocking this game as it's still currently in early access, I was very excited to see this existed. I played a lot of RealRace duratraxs rc simulator/game and even the second one, I'm not new to rc simulators. I've played great planes air rc simulator and again this is apples to oranges at this stage. I grabbed my vrc dongle so i could use my radio as the controller, the game already has support for this which I thought was pretty rad. It plays really well with the controller but again this doesn't feel anything like vrc.I keep comparing vrc to this why? It's called RC Simulation 2.0, it's still very early access and I'm very impressed with what they have so far. The user made tracks, the variety of vehicles, car setups and challenges. It's a very good RC game at the moment, I can't wait to see what this game turns into and will update this review as time goes on. I would defiantly recommend this to a friend.			"

								As an RC sim this is pretty amazing. Its EA and with that has the need for tweaking and bugs to fix. The Dev seems to be very interested in forward progress and has alot of plans to continue progress. RC cars to boats to quad copters there is a lot to choose from. Making your own track or place to fly is really cool. It is worth picking up now and for those that wait keep a close eye out for the updates.  I think this game will take off.			"

								RC simulation 2.0 is a solid, entertaining and promising game.First of all, i felt in love with the track editor. Despsite the game in an alpha, you can build detailed and complex tracks with easy intuitive tools. In a few hours you can build tracks that looks like they were made like pro developers.Hard to believe ? I show the receipts on my Steam workshop, where you can download my custom made tracks. Have a look !Buggies, varied cars, drift cars, drones and boat, the game offers lots of vehicle choices. I know RC 2.0's devs is currently working on vehicle setup. I'm looking forward to this. The multiplayer has to be improved and probably will in the coming months. You can already race against people online but only with people from your country yet. The time trial is working tho and you can try to beat your best laps on the official tracks and self-made community tracks.Some of the thing that i'd like to see ingame:- Being able to set more track check-points in the editor (currently 5 + the finish line). This is not enough to create legit multiplayer races.- With the global multiplayer, a global leaderboard with the lap times. (best of all time, best of the week, of the day, etc)- Water for Larry, he deserves it.			"

								This is an amazing Remote Control car game, I own a slash 4x4 w/ its TSM and it feels really close to the short course 4x4 in game, wow. Stunning. Best Simulator that actually works! Yes I know this simulator is still in Alpha and perfect, these things could make it a 100/100 game.- Body scratches & system failure when crashed at full speed - More powerful vehicles- if a monster truck has a 8000mah battery and a great motor it will sometimes wheelie, or even backflip.-Hydroplaning!!!There are no CONS whatsoever as of right now! This game is absolutely amazing 10/10!			"

								this game what can i say probably the most inportant thing i can say is the DEVELOPERS LISTEN and ACT i cant remember the last time i played a game where the devs are so on the ball with the community of players when they have already got the game for eg .. i drift R.C cars and have done for years so .. i suggested adding Drifting too this game and they did and the car type i wanted  not the big wings yet tho its in progress i may add .also after some communication with them and some tweaking the game is starting too become better than i thought it would the base game has tonnes of interesting things included and some of the bugs are simply hysterical and i hope they keep them in . they are too this game what the swing set was for gta iv if you have ever used that . the game modes are good .. sometimes can be complicated too navigate as it is in early access this is going too improve the suprise in this game is the physics i am suprised by how much it feels like a R.C vehicle its very close this game is looking like its going too develop into something that will be loved by all R.C hobbiests everywhere i recomend this game too anyone who is into R.C .. oh did i mention steam workshop support .. this is really really well intergrated and is seamless so i give this game at this time as it is in early access a 7 out of 10 and i will review this when the game goes final and change it then .. great game ,great developers, great physics, great fun i won this game in a competiton the developers held a while back but i was watching this and voted for it in greenlight and .. have been for a while .. as R.C's are my life :) thank you for reading the review it was as honest and accurate as i could say  "

								Devotid  did a remarkable job with this title.It is still in Early Access  and yet the controls and game mechanics are very polished.There is a decent selection of vehicles and an almost unlimited amount of tracks thanks to Workshop support.The addition of tuning to the RC's has added a great touch of realism and with the ability to actually build from parts in the games future ,this title only gets better and better.The track editor is easy and powerful allowing for some great creations that can be saved and shared to the Steam Workshop  If you like RC's ,racing games and track building this game is going to scratch a lot of itches.Highly recommend this game			"

								Not bad, better than I thought, kind of works. A few things though:1. UI is pre-historic, responsive but really ugly. Anyways, all the functions are there and it works.2. RC cars, there's no air control. When the car's in the air, you should be able to use throttle and steering to control car's attitude. Not in the game.3. RC cars, the crash physics is really bad. 1/10 scale 4wd cars break super easily, jump around and lost control just because the landing is a bit hard. (and the car breaks super easily)4. RC cars, setup has too much range to change, spring setting allow 0~1500, anything between 200~1500 will make the car jump around when touching the ground.			"

								The fact that it's an early access game, and is so stable and fun means a lot. Yes the boats need work in the current version but the devs are addressing this soon. The track creation tool is super useful and fun allowing you to create your local track and/or amazing fantasy tracks. This feature plus Steam Workshop means you never get bored playing as there are new tracks being added each week by the community. Looking forward to the future of the game.			"

								I love this game!  9/10 for an early access purchase.Its pretty polished and works great right out of the box.  Steam workshop has about 150 tracks as I am writing this to download and explore. I have been playing a friends copy but just had to buy my own so I could build more crazy tracks. :) RC Cars, Quadcopters, RC Planes, RC Boats, RC Crawling Trucks, Drifting Cars and even a RC Semi Truck.The four wheel steering monster truck is a BLAST to drive. I am also liking the ability to fly planes and quadcopters as I dont own any RC Planes.			"

								The fact that it's an early access game, and is so stable and fun means a lot. Yes the boats need work in the current version but the devs are addressing this soon. The track creation tool is super useful and fun allowing you to create your local track and/or amazing fantasy tracks. This feature plus Steam Workshop means you never get bored playing as there are new tracks being added each week by the community. Looking forward to the future of the game.			"

								The name is straight to the point. You will be having fun on land, air and sea. It is RC so ""sea"" is not the open ocean. You should not RC in the open ocean anyway as small things tend to look like food or at least worth nibbling on to larger sea creatures. Back on topic, this is a ""jack of all trades"" that succedes in all of them. You will not be complaining at all about this title as long as you have something other than the keyboard + mouse for controls. That goes for most vehicle simulators so that is not a drawback. My low budget wheel and pedals worked (that is beyond fun in the land and sea vehicles) which was a smile inducing suprise. You can (but realy shouldn't) fly with the wheel too but a cheap controller will suffice. I am almost sure it will let You use any controller so those of You with a real Futaba or whatever...get the usb adapter and this simulator. Without spoiling it, there is quite a bit of humor throughout RC Simulation 2.0 and there are updates often enough to know it is not forgotten. Anything I left out is on purpose because one man made this all by himself and RC Simulation 2.0 can speak for itself. It talks to me at times. This is a must have for anyone who likes to pilot miniature vehicles. I recommend this to anyone who currently plays any RC title. I recommend this to anyone who owns or wants to own high end RC cars, boats, planes and more. I also recommend this to anyone who wants to have the type of fun You can only have when You live alone with no neighbors.

								After playing several hours of this game on my brother's account and just messing around with all the user created maps, I found myself telling my friends about it and trying to force them to buy and play this game, even now I find myself playing some of the community maps running into the 'Larrys' just having a blast, I need to put more time into this game, but I cannot wait to see how it develops down the line, 8/10 It's really good, there is a lot of development that's going on and everything about this game is just fun and interesting. I would say that it lacks a social community for multiplayer but what can you expect from a brand new game on the indy market in early access with little advertisment? Tell your friends about this game and laugh as they freak out over the small stuff along with us. We Need More people! :D			"

								Actually a really solid game, if you want to race buggys as the controls are pretty spot on.The quadcopter controls are too stable and easy, but is hopefully getting improved. Needs more tilt and glide.The future looks great when it comes to customization, short loading times and a lot of functions.And the best part - CRAWLERS!I hope we'll be able to change tires and adjust suspension later on :)Tracks; I do believe the tracks are too small and cluttered. Not really a problem considering workshop support.			"

								I bought this game not knowing exactly what to expect. It popped up in steam and I just wanted a cheaper niche game that looked fun. I had an issue at first with the game not working, but together with a group of guys with similar problems and the Dev, We all got this thing up and running. This game is fantastic. I bought this game mostly because it does have RC crawling, but I'm looking forward to using the editor. This editor isn't just some mellowed down crappy drag and drop editor, but everything is scalable, rotatable, and it's a real powerful editor. The steam workshop will really make this game come alive.Nobody has much time in this game at the moment, but I can definatly seeing me log a ton of hours in this game. For the money this is a solid 9/10 game.			"

								at first i wasnt very impressed, but i soon realized the potential this game has!i spent 99% of my time, so far, on land. the pre set tracks are okay, but there are some gems on the Workshop. Rock Crawling is my favorite part. tuning cars to be able to take the fastest line through a track is very awesome, thanks to being able to tune as you are on the track!!!! (theres a lot of settings to fine tune) then you just get lost in the laps with your touring car. the dirt tracks are great for jumps, that you can level out with throttle control, with the SCTs, buggys, and trophy truck. its all, so far, a very quick menu interface and very easy to switch cars, tracks, and to different challenge modes. ...havent had time to create my own map. looks pretty detailed, i'll pass for now. cant wait to see custom bodys, or any real parts as settings modifiers; real tires (branded), instead of the tire front/slide grip settings....it is indeed an RC Simulation. i'm happy. can't imagine how the final realease will make me feel.

								RC Simulation 2.0 is a radio controlled vehicle ""sandbox"". It was developed by veteran RC Racer of 25+ years and an indie game developer devotid. Designed to give users the thrill of today's High Tech Radio Controlled Cars, Boats and Quad Copters on any of the user created track/maps/venues. Fly some quadcopters armed with paintball guns or go on a RC Rubicon with your Rock Crawler. The possibilities are endless with RC Simulation 2.0! Pros:Unlimited possibilitiesVery enjoyable: can provide hours of gameplay just screwing around, maybe testing your creations, or trying out what others have made.Semi-realistic (in a broad sence)The awesomeness of controlling RC vehicles without having to go outside and do it!Any controller will work: even a real RC controller can be used with the right USB-PC adaptorMany different view modes for controlling your vehicleNeutral:A few glitches (expected of an early access game) The glitches I have found have given me a good laugh :)Cons:Not much bad to be said about this game: but it is unfinished, hence early access. Final thoughtsSuper fun early access sandbox RC simulation game that will have you playing for hours! Even though I'm not a super huge fan of RC vehicles, I still enjoyed this game.If you buy this, know that it is currently unfinished but still a whole lot of fun.P.S: Really looking forward to what the dev adds next :D			"

Early Access Review
								The game has potential. One thing I don't like about default tracks is that there are way too many obstacles for the car to tip over or get stuck in, which is especially problematic for beginners who will definitely have trouble competently navigating the vehicles. I've only tried the game a few times but tipping over all the time really gets in the way of having some real fun with the land vehicles. Yeah, I could built my own nearly obstacle-free course, but maybe the mechanics/physics could be slightly altered so that the thing isn't tipping over ALL THE TIME. I drive real RCs and they don't tip over nearly as often on similar terrain! I noticed some bugs, such as the camera not switching when using hotkeys. I'm running this on linux with open source radeon (r600) drivers on an APU (A10-5800K) and it's fairly smooth at ""Beautiful"" graphical options.UPDATE: I'm now running this on an R9 285 on the highest quality settings and the cars look really nice. My main gripe still is that some of the vehicles are nearly impossible to drive. One of the cars doesn't turn if on full throttle, which is a bit ridiculous. Others wipe out way too easily. Luckily you can fine tune the cars but not everyone has the time to tweak the vehicles. And of course I realize a 2WD vehicle handles worse than a 4WD, but c'mon. Another thing that would be nice is putting throttle on the left stick and steering on right rather than the opposite (default).			"

								I'd never flown an r/c plane before but built an r/c foamboard 'noob tube' around christmas last year. I took it to a field, flew it for about 5 seconds, then crashed into the ground. It probably took me about 20 hours to build, over the course of a few months ordering the right stuff (foamboard, servos, transmitter, etc) and researching wtf to do.I bought this game for £5 on a lunchbreak and straight away crashed the plane about 15 times. Fast forward to now two days later and I can land pretty reliably but still a bit sketchy. For me this game has more than paid for itself in terms of time it has saved me taking off, crashing, then repairing my plane. I estimate it saved me at least 15 hours of my own time in the first 30 mins of playing. Only downside is I wish there were more fixed wing prop aircraft, as there is currently only 1.			"

								I came across this game while looking for alternatives to VRCPro (I'm not saying VRC is bad, it's actually quite good, I just didn't have the xbox360 controller it severly needs and the support for xbox one controller is broke).The game is quite entertaining, allowing you to do things that would normally cost hundreds of dollars. The number of vehicles aren't massive, but what it does have is variety, ranging from buggies all the way to drones. There is a track editor in the game that allows for custom tracks or replicas of real tracks.I don't have many issues with this game, but the ones I do have are mainly glitches. Multiplayer works but isn't fully fleshed out. That's forgivable considering it's early access.The dev is very devoted to his game, considering my brother couldn't play the game and he helped him get it working.			"

With the tracks, it seems to be plentiful with both the stock and workshop tracks. However, since this game is still in early access, I'm expiriencing plenty of bugs in the game. The multiplayer system is practially dead. In short: It's your call.			"

								Very fun Sim to play! I come from playing a little Mobile RC sim called Absolute RC Flight Simulator (it has alot of planes and copters/quads but there are a few boats and cars) its a decent little app for a little relaxation, thats why i wanted to get this game.Pros:AMAZING graphics/lighting effectsController Support and key binding is sooo helpful (virtually impossible to play properly with arrowkeys)Ability to make your own tracks and post them on the workshopand best of all:a wide and possibly growing range of vehicals to choose fromCons:can be buggy at timescontrols can feel to sensitive at timessome of the models (mainly the 2 short track trucks) have a problem where the body becomes invisable when looking through the windows or upside down.Ideas:now mostly what id like to see added to the game is mostly more model related but an idea for some customization i had is as follows:what if you implimet an ability to 'make' models and post them like you do with tracks like say someone wanted to make an RC version of say Big Foot (the monster truck) they could take the main build style of a rock crawler or truck and edit the size and shape of different parts of the truck, paint it, add decals or do like hand painting where you can edit parts of the body color manually to add the designs that are on the truck and post itsame could go for other vehicals, if you add helicopters you could eventually make something like a Bell 222 like AirWolf (best Heli ever XD) or maybe make A T-6 Texan with an AeroShell Paint Job, or take an F18 Hornet With a Blue Angel paint job... the possiblilitys for that are truly endless...I hope to see this game grow in its development (mainly so there can be more people to play online with lol).As it stands right now at the time of this review i give it a 9.2/10  its a fun sim to play with a wide range of customization for everyting from controls to each vehical you drive/fly but the minor graphical glitches and the... well not 'lacking' but small, variety of vehicals kinda loses.. but again its in development so more can be added :D cant wait to see what else this game has in store KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...

								I love to fly, so i choose a Piper Cub and head to the air field where my plane is broken, shoved up against a fence and stuck on a flipped over table, while inside a small fenced in area. Try to reset the plane...reset, reset, reset, each time it re-spawns against the fence and breaks. Give up and try the crawler...it can't crawl, it has to be going fast to even get up a hill, and you can't get between the markers which is just a narrow path, it gets no traction at all.Give up, try taking the 1/8 buggy to the track, what track ? ....it's just a total mess of random odd shaped hills with no real visible path to follow, the tracks that are decent and marked are way to small, the scale of the track compared to the cars is way off, and when you get stuck some idiot picks your car up and sets it right back down on the tube so you're still stuck and have to have him reset your car a second time, maybe a third time. Then there is the sound of the cars...seriously, what broken piece of electronic equipment were they recorded from, they phusics are terrible, and if you just look at the car wrong a wheel will fall off. I used to race Team Losi trucks in real life and i am also an RC pilot, crashing a $1200 nitro JR heli is more fun than this simulator. 0.3 hours and i already hate this game, and sadly it was a birthday gift to me. No, i do not recommend this game to anyone.			"

								I bought this so I could practice Fixed Wing as I just bought a couple of RC Planes.. as LA Guns states in his review things to date are a bit broken, buggy and need a shedload of polish. The ""Follow Cam"" for flying is almost unplayable it needs to be fixed not floating.A Zoom pic/cam would be much more usefull than the ""map cam"" currently on offer.TBH for the reasons I bought the early access it's a bit of a let down, the free Picasim is actually much better for learning to fly Quadcopter and Planes but that really is as far as it goes... RC Simulation 2.0 potentially offers so much more. It's early access so I'm not moaning, I'm hoping the sim' continues to develop.The cars are much more fun and I've been having a blast with the short course trucks on some of the tracks.For those wanting a sim to practice flying, RC Simulation 2.0 isn't what I'd recommend at this time.

								I've had this ""game"" for some time now and I've yet been able to play it.  Here's what happens.  I choose the car, track, etc, then click on GO.  The car shows up on the screen and after about 2 seconds, the car zooms in until the screen is solid black.  That's it, can't do a friggin thing.  Here's my system:  Intel i7 950 processor, 12 Gig DDR3 memory, Nivida 780 GTX video card and lots and lots of drive space.  Doesn't make any difference what controller I choose.  Game is useless at this point.			"

								If you are looking for a RC simulator to practice your flying skills, this is just NOT for you. Using the quadcopter feels everything but real, slightly better if you are using fixed wings BUT still it is way too poorly designed , vehicle choice is extremely poor. About graphic.... even using my GPU at highest settings the graphic is just extremely poor.I DO NOT RECOMMEND this game at all. Game is over-priced so far it should be for sale for 3£ the most			"

								It's a crime to call this game a simulation. I really wanted to like this game-- I tried to find something good in it, but I just can't. Everything is wrong here.Why?One: The gameplay is confusing as hell. I wasted about 3 minutes trying to figure out why my car couldn't move and that was because I didn't realize that I needed to move my character (who controls horrible, has terrible camera views) to the car.Two: Barely any content for a $15 game. You get 8 cars with 6 different tracks. And it's as if they're trying to force you to use mods to make the game more fun-- but the whole point of gaming is that it has to be fun WITHOUT mods. I don't want to modify game files just so I can have more fun with it.Three: Ugly graphics and performance. The graphics makes the game look far more older than it is. It looks like this game was made in 2005! Can I just mention how bad the performance is? My own computer is having trouble staying above 30 fps, even at moderate settings. No game should have performance as bad as this, especially when the graphics look like something that came from a ♥♥♥♥ing Xbox game!Four: CAR CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE! If you're using a gamepad, one notch to the left can completely throw your car off-course, driving into a wall, or accidentally killing yourself or somebody else standing brainlessly on the track. Oh yeah, sometimes my car got stuck on a piece of the track, like a barrier, and I was unable to get out; but the developers for some reason didn't design a way for the player to fix the car if this happened. Even the braindead track marshals can't do anything, and just sit and watch a poor RC car laying upside down in the middle of the track! Can I just mention how sensitive each car is in the game? You'd be going 0 to 60 in no time flat!Five: Dead multiplayer. Nobody is online, simple as that.Overall: I can't recommend this game, even for free, because this game is bad and it takes up space. Please ignore this game no matter how good it may look from the previews. I know this game is Early Access, but I have to review what the game is currently, not what it will be in the future. Who knows; my review might change if they actually fix the things mentioned above.			"

Starting to think this was just a cash grab,,,  I would list all what's wrong with it but its way to extensive and way to much time to spend on such a useless piece of software.... If and when this game gets on the ball I will change my rating but for now STAY AWAY!!!   If you want a great sim The best sim for land R/C Models look for  VRC , VRC-Pro check that out,,, much better and you can use your REAL R/C controler.			"

								This is a great early access game because it is a jack of all trades, but a master of none. It has decent graphics, decent amount of cars but the creativity with this game is sub par. If you don't have any previous experience with RC cars than I suggest you don't buy this because this seems to be more of a professional experience. But this game can improve in lots of ways, mainly in physics. It feels like I'm driving a car made by the bouncy ball factory, bouncing all around the track. Another complaint is the controls, which are difficult to perfectly calibrate and you have to have a newer remote control to be compatible with the game. To the developer, I would say that this game is great so far but the two main problems with this game are controlling the vehicles and the physic engine. Also, it would be cool if you have name brand vehicles (or knockoff's of the name brand cars EX: Traxis Slush) But great work for an early access! Edit: I also forgot to mention how you should add in realistic sounds so drivers don't get headaches. Also Nitro veichles would be cool!			"
