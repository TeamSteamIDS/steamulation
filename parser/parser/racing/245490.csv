												It could be a good game... Not the best one, but good. But it's not even good. Because Ubisoft.Uplay? Check.Microtransactions? Check.Season pass that don't include all DLCs? Check.Multiplayer that was added after all DLCs? Check. Most players just moved on already.Also the game has much worse optimisation than Trials Evolution, a lot less stable and so on. Just be aware that you might not be able to launch it at all because reasons.The main problem is that Trials Fusion isn't exactly the most creative game... It's just another sequel just like Ubisoft likes it - bland unispiring game with exactly the same visuals and gameplay with a bunch of gimmicks and extensive marketing campaign on top.Trials Evolution was just better game overall. It was just that - complete package without gimmicks, a really great and all round polished game in which developers cleary put their love and soul. And Trials Fusion is just a second-rate game that only exists to get your money, Ubi-business as always.			"

												This game is my go to time killer, it's not for everyone though.You should NOT buy this game IF you don't like spending  hours trying to perfect a level, or use 30 minutes on a level and then have the  game tell you that you took too long.Although this game is so rewarding when you pull off that insanely difficult  jump, or when you beat everyones high score. This is a time waster, if you make it through to the extreme maps, then I'd say good luck. The difficulty of the game ranges from beginner, easy, normal, hard, extreme. When you are on the beginner maps you'll blast through the  levels, although when you move up, it'll of  course get harder - a lot harder. The game has 1  big bug which could put you off buying it though. It's that low fps cause a slowmotion effect, which renders the game more or less unplayable. A solution is to lower the settings, but i'd just like to include this.  The DLC that's out so far (3 out of 6 planned)  they're all worth picking up IF you like the game. I'd say they're more difficult than the other maps, but not by much. In each DLC  you get atleast 9 new trails. I think you'd have to be a person that wants to get the best medal on everything to justify the 5€ price tag though.I personally love this game when I need to take a break from everything. It's calming and frustrating in a weird sort of way.			"

												In my opinion this game stands on its own as a Trials game, but there are a few things that I hate about it and force me to not recommend it. First up is Uplay. Everyone hates Uplay. There are never any players online, so there goes that whole section of gameplay... there's never anybody to play with.The DLC is just a huge money grab. The game by itself doesn't have enough content to justify the $19.99 price tag. I paid it and expected a lot... I got a little with the offer to pay more to get tracks that should have come with the game. That extra $19.99 for the season pass seems steep, because it is. $40 for a ""complete"" game that doesn't have much depth or the replayability of the older Trials games is a rip off. If the DLC (which should have come with the game anyways) was included in the original price, I would be more apt to recommend it.Screw Ubisoft for being so greedy, and for forcing Uplay on the innocent.

												Please take time to read the whole review...Don't get me wrong, by itself Trials Fusion is a decent game - Great graphics, great scenery and keeps the elements of its predecessors without changing too much. However, as a person who has dedicated over 120 hours into Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I must say that Fusion is pretty underwhelming compared to it.First of all, there are significantly fewer levels in this game than there are in TEGE - it took me at least 20 hours to get the medal tally required to unlock the platinum medals, but in Fusion it only took me 4 hours. It definitely felt like a step backwards in content.This leads to the next point - Ubisoft decided that in order for us to get more levels, we'd have to fork out money for a season pass. That's right, they took our beloved Trials franchise and decided to include DLC in it. It definitely feels like a dog move against us.Lastly, they decided to leave out the most essential feature when they released this game - online multiplayer! And only this year they decide they're finally going to release it? Pretty crap if you ask me.Final verdict - If you have played Trials Evolution Gold Edition for a while and feel like playing some new, different levels, buy this game when it's on sale, as if you ignore all of its flaws it's a pretty good game.If you have never played a trials game before, buy Trials Evolution Gold Edition as it is a lot more fun to play than this game.

												Sale edit: Every DLC is on sale right now, this hasn't happened before, so take the very low price into account with my DLC reviews :)Awesome level MAX Edit: This isn't included in the season pass, and as yet I do not own it. I'll update this section with details on whether the DLC is worth a full price or not when I purchase it for myself. As for the introduced microtransactions, they're purely cosmetic and not required.IntroductionThis was the first Trials game I ever played, and it's great. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, most of them are negative simply because it uses Uplay, which I shall talk about further down the review.SettingFirst off, the environment in this game is stunning. For a game like Trials, in which you just ride your bike across level after level, you wouldn't expect this level of quality, the world looks like it's part of a much larger game. There's also plenty of variety, as you quickly move from the futuristic city to platforms in the sky, ancient ruins, outdoor courses, underwater bases and even the planet's core. There is also some slight hints of story included through a few characters talking throughout the game, which hint at how the world became like this. Gameplay It's trials. You drive your bike, tilt your weight and try to make it to the end as fast as possible and with as few failures as possible. Every level also has three challenges that encourage you to play differently, and some even involve minigames entirely different to how the game is usually played. The difficulty as you pass through the levels is done very well. By the time I was met with much harder obstacles, I'd already got a basic idea of how to surpass them, and not once did a death feel cheap.DLCThe DLCs add some nice extra content that also gives you a look at more of the world of Fusion, and provide some decent challenge. I wouldn't recommend buying them seperately, but if you don't want to buy the Deluxe Edition, here's a summary of their content and quality:2/10/15 Edit: Read the Deluxe Edition section for my opinion on prices! Riders of the Rustlands The first DLC and the weakest. Featuring only 6 levels, an FMX course and a mediocre minigame. - Not really worth £4 compared to the other DLCs, skip this one and get another. Empire of the Sky Same as above, 6 levels, FMX and a minigame. The levels are a bit better than Rustlands, but still not worth £4. If you've beat the game and want some more fun, get this DLC. Otherwise you can ignore it. Welcome to the Abyss Breaks the chain and includes 8 levels instead of 6, as well as the FMX and minigame at the end. This DLC gives an interesting look at an underwater empire that used to live under the ocean. Some story is delivered through another AI who speaks to you at certain points. The levels are of a higher standard than the first two DLCs, and I think barely justifies its £4 pricetag. Fire in the deep 9 levels, FMX and a minigame. In this DLC you are even further down, underneath the planet's core. As you move from level to level you go further underground, giving a nice indication of your progress through the DLC. There are also multiple secret recordings hidden around the levels, which give some extra information about the world, and what went on in the mines. Worth it. Fault One Zero Personally, I believe this is the best DLC. It drops one level and returns to 8 trials again, but the quality of the levels steps up greatly. This DLC has a focus on technology, much more so than previously shown, with teleporters, anti gravity machines and Mechs featuring. The levels in this DLC are very inventive, including  one that repeatedly glitches between looking normal, and a blue cyberspace-esque environment and  an interesting level in which you drive around inside three arcade machines! This DLC is definitely worth £4. After the Incident The sixth and final DLC. Same as above, 8 levels with an FMX and Minigame. One of my main disapointments with Trials Fusion was the lack of detail as to what was happening. I understand that this is a game solely based on a random guy riding a bike through obstacle courses, but with such an interesting world, with many deeper story elements hinted at throughout, I really wanted to learn more. After the Incident does so nicely. It's set in the future, when all the world is in ruins after the aforementioned ""Incident"". The levels all focus on fairly different areas, all destroyed or going through some form of crisis. Similar to Fire in the Deep, you can find secrets in the levels, which give you some backstory as to how all of this started. The way this is done is great, as  SynDI talks to you through a dating game text box, with amusing exagerated changes in her expression as she talks. If you want to know more about the world behind Fusion, or just want to play even more levels, this DLC is worth the money. Deluxe Edition  I'd like to point out that this game has gone on multiple sales, but not a single time have the DLC packs gone on discount themselves, and it doesn't look like they will at any time unfortunately. --In the most recent sale at the time of writing, all DLCs aside from Awesome Level MAX have been reduced to 99p, so I'd definitely recommend waiting for a sale before purchasing any DLCs-- As such, I highly recommend you get the Deluxe edition during a sale, I managed to pick it up for £10. Otherwise, if you beat the game and decide you want more, you will be paying a much higher price. Say you got the base game on sale for £6. Now if you got three of the DLCs, that'll cost you an extra £12. Half the DLC total DLC and you've spent £18 already. The Deluxe edition is a much better purchase (During a sale of course. The DLC is good but not worth £30!)Why the negative reviews?Now, there are three main flaws that have gave this game so many negative reviews. First main point is the multiplayer. I played the game entirely solo and had fun, I can't really comment on it.Secondly, people seem to be complaining about this being a bad port, and having a many performance issues. For reference, I ran the game on an i5 3570k, 8gb RAM and a GTX 770 with constant 60fps and no issues of any kind. The issue may be related to lower-end machines.And as for the last point, UPlay. The majority of these reviews are from people starting the game, seeing Uplay, closing it and leaving a bad review. I will say right here that if you avoid this game because of Uplay, you are stupid. But UPlay sucks! The impact of UPlay is nowhere near as bad as the reviews make it sound. You start the game on Steam, UPlay appears, takes a couple seconds to log in, then minimizes and starts the game. You only need to interact with it once in order to create an account, and after that you don't need to touch the thing, aside from closing it when you are done.EDIT: UPlay now does not even appear when you start a game through Steam. It minimizes itself. Seriously guys, the impact is so minimal it's not even worth arguing about!ConclusionAll in all, I recommend Trials Fusion to anyone who is an existing trials fan, or enjoys 2D games with high difficulty. Though the price is a little steep for the content on offer, so I'd suggest waiting for a sale and getting the deluxe edition. As earlier stated, it's much better value as the DLCs never get discounted, and only costed £4 (the price of a single DLC) more than the normal pack in the latest sale. And finally, do not avoid this game because of UPlay, there is no reason to.			"

												This game worked for a while, now it crashes on startup. Ubisoft support is terrible, all the recommendations given where not only worthless but wrong. Uplay sucks.

												i think it's pretty damn crappy that you can buy the season pass and yet they still withold content from you. although, admittedly, said content is pretty f'ing stupid. and i only know this because the awesome max edition was on, like 80% discount for a very short time when it came out, so i bought it for one of my other pc's.other than that, it's an ok game, i guess. worthwhile at 75% discounted price. notwithstanding that, i advise against purchasing this game because there's an unbelievable amount of recycling in the race courses.and, quite naturally, this game, which the customer pays for outright, has been infected with the dreaded microtransactions which were supposed to be reserved strictly for the free2play business model. very, F'ing, shady.also, i unlocked almost everything in this game in about fifteen hours of play.Red Lynx has sold their souls to ubisoft and i won't be giving them any more of my money.in case you feel the urge to contradict me on any of these points, don't waste your time, i'm not here for conversation. this section was provided for me by steam to state my opinion and i won't stand for anyone to come here and offer me their review of my review.so, you can keep your critiques to yourselves and simply move along.

												This game's alright... I'm not at all alright while playing it, but I still love it. After the rage wears off, the game gives you a good sense of accomplishment when you finally get that 0 fault gold medal run, especially on later (hard) stages.While Trials Fusion is a streamlined trials game (it is much, much easier than Evolution), there is still a good amount of hard tracks in the base game, and a few of them only the most persistent players will be able to ""gold medal"" (while others will rage quit out of the game and write a review...). There are 8 zones in the base game, and each one has 6 to 10 tracks in it (8 on average), that number is significantly increased with the season pass, which adds 6 new zones. Right now, 9/10/2014, the season pass only offers 3 zones, with 3 more on the way before May 2015. The game also includes a track editor, so you can create your own tracks, and you can easily access and play tracks built by other people online (which are pretty impressive from what I've seen/played).Now I'm not a big fan of Ubisoft's PC releases, because I usually get hit by poor optimization issues that plague a lot of their games at release, this game's performance however, pleasantly surprised me and put a big fat smile on my face, after the stutter fest that was Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I wasn't very hopeful going into this one. The game runs perfectly smooth maxed out on my machine, and the only stutter I got was on a graphically intensive track, while I had 2 video streams running in the background, after trying the same track without flash videos hogging my cpu, the stutter went away, and the game ran buttery smooth again.For reference, my PC specs are:i7 920 @3Ghzgtx660ti 2gb8gb ramwin7 64bitIt's worth mentioning that the game has a pretty good, yet weird sense of humor, for example whenever you finish a track, something funny and dumb is sure to happen, like the rider falling of his bike after he crosses the finish line, landing in the water and racing a cruise ship, or when you cross a finish line that's on top of a 2 story hut, the door closes behind you, and the hut starts flying off like a rocket. I also really enjoy the AI commentary (I guess you can call them the narrators), and the biker's yells and woohoos remind me of Homer Simpson.This game is a steal even at full price, and on a decent sale it should be a no-brainer if you played and liked previous Trials games, but I'm sure 2D platformer game enthusiasts would love it as well. As for the score, I'm giving it a 9/10.			"

												Trials Fusion is just a mindless blast of fun and mayhem. Get some friends together and it only multiplies it, but it's solid even by itself.Here's a video showcasing my shenanigans in this game for those who are curious. If not, just read the rest of the review below.

I'll start by saying the gameplay is pretty simple, but challenging at the same time. The only thing you're doing is balancing your rider and your bike along a path while pounding the gas. However, the balancing part is the main problem and where all the challenge lies. The courses have you flying and leaping over all sorts of nonsensical obstacles, and landing it perfectly just doesn't happen sometimes. Even more so when you're trying to show off in front of your friends and botch the trick. But in my personal opinion, it's more fun failing than it actually is succeeding. It's hilarious watching my rider flop around because I was being a dope and got overzealous in my flips, which is a huge boon to the game because you're having a blast whether you're succeeding or failing miserably like I do sometimes.The game also doesn't feel cheap, nor feel like it cheats you out of anything. It's easy enough to get a silver medal on most tracks, but getting a gold is never too out of reach. It saddens me a little that doing tricks doesn't net you anything special besides cool points for yourself, but at the same time, it's one less thing I have to worry about if all I'm trying to do is unlock things. It allows you to play the game the way you want to, and having more options of playing the game is always better.And even when you run out of tracks to do in the game, there is a track creation tool that can make more and be shared with the comminity, so you don't have to worry about stuff to do. The game is even getting DLC in the future with more tracks if community stuff isn't your thing, so there's an option for you there as well.As far as negatives go, my complaints are very minor. While the stages themselves look amazing, all the stuff that's happening sometimes can be a little distracting from what you're doing. Or sometimes even the reverse is true, that you're so focused on your bike, you don't notice all the stuff happening around you when you want to see it. Another thing is that all of the stuff happeing in the background doesn't really effect what you're doing in the foreground. It's just fluff. I think it would've added a bit more diversity and dynamics if the stage interacted with the rider more.There's also still a few bugs in the game or poor optimization. When I went to the create tool, it locked up my comp, which is a beast and shouldn't have any trouble loading anything. The same goes with how long it takes to select a ride at the beginning of the stages. I just stare at a black screen for a good while before something eventually pops up. But thankfully you can just press A to go to the course regardless, so it isn't that big of a deal.So to sum it up, for 20 dollars, you're gonna have a blast with this title. It looks good, feels good, has a great sense of humor (the endings and the announcer make me laugh quite a bit), has potential to grow, and is fun with friends. Definitely pick this up, even more so when it goes on sale.			"

												I am heartily disappointed with this game. The previous two Trials games were great; full of content, great level design, simple but effective layout/gameplay/difficulty levels. Trials Fusion offers an infuriatingly bad soundtrack, a forced 'story' and setting, an SSX style 'tricks' dealy that is hardly utilised, a redundant multiplayer mode etc etcNot to mention the fact that the game is largely hidden behind a season pass paywall. That means £32 for all of the content. Most of which is probably terrible. What a load of paywall bull***t! Also: Uplay. Thanks for nothing Ubisoft and associated sell-outs.			"

												as much as I love the the Trials series, I can't recommend this game to people. I'll play the living hell out of it because I'm obsessed with the series, but it takes a very specific kind of person to really squeeze 50 dollars of play value out of this (base game + all DLC).Ubisoft really did some damage to the series and this game hardly stands well against previous games in the series. I still believe Trials HD is the best in the series, but that's more a personal opinion. I would recommend checking out the previous game, Trials Evolution Gold Edition, rather than settling on Fusion. Although the multiplayer is still rather empty, it's still a more down-to-earth title that keeps a lot of the aesthetics that make the Trials series so great. Plus it has way more tracks in the base game than Fusion does.			"

												When the game would suffer any drop in FPS it decides to run in Slow motion. Making it unplayable. Bugs are riddled throughout, Crashing frequently. Being forced to use uPlay you will also be plagued with another service that does not function. and thus removes a loarge proportion of the game as uPlay is unreliable. You must also then wait at every option for the game to attempt to connect to Ubisoft, wasting you time as you are told what you already know, that ubisoft is unavailable.On top of the game being unplayable for a lot of people, The Deluxe edition with the ason pass has not been transfering across with Uplay, meaning that the Season pass unlocks are still Locked.Do not buy untill the game is fixed.

												If you would kindly ignore all ""not recommended"" reviews as 10.5 hours on record is not enough gameplay time to write a snotty review and downgrade a now perfect game.  The DLC is worth every penny, for £19.99 you are technically getting another game in terms of tracks, 200+ extra objects to create your own track with, aside from the 100+ items you already get to start with, and the imagination of the creators of tracks in terms of things that move, explode, sink and even appear, giving you even less time to plan the next trial.I have 242 hours on record and a relative has 1000+ hours.  You can't complain if the game is too difficult, if you want the platinum medal?.  You have to grind each track to earn it.In short, this is a underrated and unappreciated gaming masterpiece! "

												Trials Fusion is just like Trials 2 and Trials Evolution but set in a semi-futuristic world. Does it do anything new ? Apart from a couple of decent looking tracks, not really, no. Next to these new tracks you have your licenses, stunts, mini-games and character customization. All the things you would expect from a sequel. But at least it doesn't run as poorly as Evolution did.Is it any easier ? Hell no. And that's the magic of Trials.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Hmm Where do I start? It has bikes, a screaming guy, the most hilarious tricksystem I've ever seen, and FUUUTUREEEEE!!!For the people that owned Trials Evolution:If you had a fun time with Trials Evolution I'm 100% sure you'll love Fusion, the game has been revamped, a whole set of new bikes, new courses, a new world, new music, and CHALLENGES !In summary, if you love Evolution, Fusion is no difference, its familiar, funky music, new bikes, tracks and what not.For the people that are new to the Trials series:Let me tell you that this game is not for the fainted hearts, this game is easy but it gets tougher and tougher, until you say F*ck this I quit. Ofcourse, the more you'll play the more you'll get familiar with the physics on the bike, the tracks and other useful tips and tricks you'll pick up on while playing.- I highly recommend playing this with a controller, either Xbox or PS3 (Get an emulator that emulates your ps3 controller to x360) Because while progressing through the game, there are a lot of climbs, bunnyhops and other hard tricks you'll have to pull of precise in order to place some good times on the scoreboard and finishing faultless, therefore I'd highly recommend a controller more than a clunky keyboard.- The game looks really colorful, it's like a rainbow took a ♥♥♥♥ on the game, thats how colorful it is, and it's pretty, really pretty.Its an absolute joy and feast for your eyes.Never the less screw the graphics cuz gameplay > graphics amirite? If you said no then smh.- The game starts easily like I said but when progressing it gets more difficult on a level of ""Not finishable"" If you're brand new and having issues with this platformer.The physics play a huge roll in this game which is why it takes skill to successfully and flawlessly play and finish this game.- Challenges that have been added in the game, which are mini tasks you CAN do (Not need to) for extra XP are also lots of fun and sometimes really stressful. They make you feel super happy once you've completed it. They make you feel annoyed and boiling when you screw it up in the end.Note: I suck at reviews, never done one but I'm just typing whatever comes to mind and what I would like to know about a game I'm willing to buy.- Customisation has been redone, you can now pick from multiple sets of ""armor/suits"" that are unlockable by finishing tracks, earning xp or doing certain tasks. The only negative thing that I can think of is that you can not save the color you have picked for example on your shirt, to match that with your pants/helmet... Customisation is a cool addon, also the bikes are again modifyable (if that's a word >.<) in which you unlock bodykits and wheels to customize them. That's pretty cool if you ask me.- Two slightly annoying things that I've noticed while playing this (Also been confirmed by other friends that play trials) The loading time on the Garage/customisation takes a while (10-20s) so that could be a little issue if you're inpatient.- If you do happen to buy the game, let me tell you ""WELCOME TO THE FUTURE"" on every single start up. It makes me laugh but can get annoying if you pick up on it.In summary: The game handles great, controller recommended, great visuals, easy to pick up and play, hard to master, great value with a lot of grinding on challenges that are added to each and EVERY track (Yes even extreme tracks). If you're still not sure I recommend reading some other reviews that are more helpful than mine isI tried my best >:3Thank you			"

												Trials Fusion is the latest installment in what has generally been a game that offers a simple premise but provides a lot of gameplay punch.  While there aspects of Fusion that I am greatly impressed with, there are a few things that I am unhappy with. For those unfamiliar, the Trials games are a very simple premise. You're riding a motorbike (along with other vehicles in Fusion) across a large variety of tracks with physics being the ultimate gameplay component. You have to control the bike properly or you will wipe out.....A LOT!I've broken this into a simple pros/cons list for anyone that has tl;dr issues :-)Pros:+ Looks fantastic. The colors are rich and have real pop to them. If you can play this in Ultra at the highest resolution you're in for a treat, even at lower resolutions it still is great eye candy+ Base game course design is interesting for the most part and the futuristic setting adds more than I thought it would.+ Trick/FX gameplay styles really add to the depth and encourage playing tracks multiple times with both fastest times and trick scores being seperate goals.+ A ton of community made tracks at your fingertips.Cons:- Pricey DLC with the season pass costing the same price as the base game making MSRP for both base and season pass (a.k.a. Deluxe Edition) just $20 less than a AAA title. There have been two DLC packs released thus far with more to come.- Some base game courses are much shorter than you'd expect.- Lacks the challenge at the lower levels that earlier Trials titles brought. Seems watered down for casuals/newcomers in respects. The physics are still brutal depending on course, but definitely easier to get the hang of. ATVs are disgustingly easy.-  Four months after release and online multiplayer is still not in the game, yet is promised by the developer. This is UNACCEPTABLE when being advertised as having multiplayer especially at the cost of the full package. Local multiplayer only at the moment (8/23/14 is the date of this review).- Tedious unlocking system.- There seems to be some measure of a ""story"" mode to the single player game where you're regularly spoken to by a female AI similar to GlaDOS of the Portal games, except the Trials AI lady lacks the wit of that classic character and is generally just grating.Let me be clear, while my cons are glaring, I do not regret my purchase of this game. I have a real soft spot for this series and have gotten a lot of mileage out of the earlier titles and am going to continue to play this one as it plays well and I can't overstate how great it looks. I was first introduced to Trials when it came out on Xbox 360 Arcade and I put well over 100 hours into that iteration of the game. I hesitated on this new one until I upgraded my hardware and now that I have, I am very glad I waited at least until then.  That being said, unless you are like me and a fan of the Trials series and know what you're getting into, do yourself a favor and hold off until this is on sale. I recommend this with a caveat. Definitely pick it up when on sale, but unless you're really into the series/gameplay style, you're fine waiting. "

												TL;DR: Looks good, includes interesting features with a lot of community interaction and fun gameplay, however there are issues such as Uplay, large quantities of DLC and optimisation problems.This is the first Trials game that I have ever played or owned, having heard good things from previous instalments I picked it up on sale. After finishing half of the game (excluding DLC) I felt that I could make an opinion on the package.Positive features:-Nice colourful graphics-Fun challenging core gameplay-Level creation functionality and user created maps-Interesting concepts e.g. the ability to perform tricksNegative features:-Uplay is required-The music is bland-DLC is frequent and costly-Issues with performance in certain instancesTo conclude, while not a bad game, Trials Fusion left me with an unsatisfied; while exciting to begin with the experience lost me and was never able to recapture my enthusiasm. If it's on sale it might be worth picking up if this style of game interests you.			"

												This is basically the same game as Trials Evolution, but this time around we got the DLC on PC, which means boatloads of new options in user-made tracks. The people at Ubi / Redlynx finally started updating Track Central with manually converted console (XB1, PS4, X360) tracks so you have cool new challenging tracks to play every week. Single-line multiplayer is finally here too, and it's functional. This is a thumbs up if you have a few friends to multi with and compare scores.			"

												Trials Fusion is a work of beauty.I may not be an aficionado, having only spent ~100 hours playing the original.  Mostly by myself, but often with friends, loving every second of it.  I've probably crashed 100,000 times, but I have a few accomplishments in the more extreme trials that I'm proud of.If that describes your love of the game, then you will like this one too.  I've read that some people have problems with framerates, but I have not.  The video options allow for a lot of tweaking to match your video card's capabilities it seems.  I have 18 hours clocked on Trials Fusion at the time of writing this review.			"

												This is not a terrible game by any means, but it feels like a definite step back from the previous installment and, by comparison especially, a lousy value proposition.The tracks are significantly fewer and blander, and that's not balanced out by the new mechanisms.Doing tricks seems to be based on your angle and the input on the right stick, but it feels pretty sketchy/inconsistent. The stages built around doing those tricks for points are too unforgiving: the checkpointing means you only get one shot at each jump trick, so any failed attempt means you've lost a potential 20% or so points for that stage. Maybe losing your multiplier would have been enough of a deterrent; as it stands, falling is too easy and too costly, so it makes sense to play it safe -- and that's boring, especially for a mode that's supposed to be a bit more crazy than the precision driving at the core of the franchise. Uniracers did it first and better, basically.'Challenges' are either Easter eggs hard to figure out without a guide, or require feats like finishing with zero fault while doing 10 tricks or never letting go of the gas pedal. That's one way to stretch playtime over a small number of tracks...Tournaments are one thing that's improved, though: they're time-limited and renewed every few hours, which is a good encouragement to participate and try to rank high.Now that the first piece of DLC (out of a planned 6) is out, it's obvious that we can't count on them to fix the fundamental problem of there not being enough content: each will be the size of a world, so 6 regular tracks and 2 gimmicky ones (and the first pack is boring like the rest, too).Are RedLynx / Ubi counting on player-created content to pick up the slack? Trying to find really good content is still a crapshoot though -- you can only rely on the 'featured' categories, very basic filters, or a percentage of positive reviews. There's quite a few enjoyable enough tracks, some with clever moments, but few if any are comparable in quality to the dev-made tracks from Trials Evolution, and you have to be in the mood to rummage around for them.It pains me to say it, but this is a disappointment. Just get Trials Evolution, and don't get Fusion until you've played so much Evo you're sick of it. And even then, be aware it's not great value at full price.			"

You get to wacth a loading screen 2. you get past the loading screen like finally give me the good stuff and then There is an update 3. after Update u cannot play it just keeps crashing 4.If your computer isnt a complete microwave you get past the update then uplay comes along and you need a new account... or maybe this is just me. 5. you might be able to play it for a month but next update ur game wont open again So i Would recomend this game if your computer isnt from the microwave store Wave's are us like mine.

												Being a trails fan ever since the relase of HD, I was incredibly excited to get this.But of course, whenever i try to play the actual game, I only get around 15 fps at most. Looking at the system requirements, everything seemed a-okay except for my graphics card, which at the time wasnt a huge issue for me as id play on the lowest settings. With games that I dont have the expected graphics card for, all I did was that, and they ran fine.Except for this game.Even with the absolute lowest settings I lag like hell. The lag is so unbearable that it goes in slow motion, making it absolutly impossible to play at all. Ive never had any problems with this in the past.Im going to possibly try to get another graphics card to fix the issue. But until then, I can't reccomend this to anyone.ALSO, Uplay is the most useless ♥♥♥♥ ever.			"

												Trials Fusion is a perfect time killer because you'll be playing and retrying all the tracks multiple times to get the best times. Thanks to the great bike physics this series is known for, the game is the very definition of “easy to learn, hard to master” and “trial and error”. So it requires a certain degree skill to fully enjoy but in my opinion it is extremely satisfying to see yourself getting better and beating that one hard track you've been stuck for so long.The game is not without it's problems: Uplay is mandatory and still a piece of sh*t that nobody wants, micro-transactions (luckily only for cosmetics), DLCs are pretty expensive for the amount of content they offer (best get them on sale), multiplayer is dead due to being added really late paired with PC having lowest audience for Trials games and also a controller is required because keyboard controls are next to useless.Many Trials veterans say that Evolution is better and more worth playing over Fusion for various reasons and they're probably right but I wouldn't know since I never got into Evolution when it came out on PC. The futuristic setting, electronic music and the ambiguous hidden story of Fusion was more interesting to me than bland old warehouses in a desert valley accompanied by rock music...But I'm in the minority who cares about that stuff so this review is simply from a Trials noob who enjoy the game for what it is despite it's faults :)			"

												A great new entry in the line of Trials games.A unique and addictive mix of puzzle, physics and racing; which RedLynx has been mastering for what must be a decade now. I've been playing the RedLynx trials games since waaay back when they were just 2D Flash games; so they've come a looong way.However - I ride a motorcycle daily, still do trials biking on my bicycle, and have ridden actual Trials motorcycles, and I actually prefer the handling of it's predecessor: ""Trials Evolution"".PROSThe prettiest graphics of any Trials game to date; with fantastic gameplay to match.There's a wide range of beautiful environments and props for you to not only race in, but also create your own tracks in (with a bewildering amount of customisation). Your rides and riders can be personalised too, with (most) items being unlocked with progress and paid for with the in-game currency you earn. The rider can now do tricks in midair (once you unlock them) for that extra XP and show(off)manship. Tracks are varied, clever and engaging. And for those hardcore completionists, there's three side achievements for every track which range from simple to-dos to entire minigames. Lots of extra fun and value. Oh, and in case you didn't know, there are also Online and Local multiplayer modes too.CONSHandling that can be hard to understand and predict.I will say, the bikes move at a more realistic pace than ever before, feeling like they have real weight an inertia. But hit a bump or land from a drop, and sometimes those physics go out the window with a bike that surges and bounces like a space hopper, or jams/judders in a way that seems to stall the bike. Evolution had a bit of this too, but it made sense as the bikes felt light and twitchy. But when a hefty bike does it, it's hard to react, and harder to counter (the heavier bikes mean less airborne control). Performance also struggles too - The game isn't overly complicated, but it seems quite demanding on CPU and GPU power for what you get.OVERALLA great time wasting and skill honing game for people of all ages and gaming levels. Definitely worth buying if you see it on sale, but you may as well skip Steam and get in from uPlay directly (as you have to use uPlay anyway). However, if you're rig isn't very powerful, you'd be better served getting Trials Evolution - it's just as much fun, and probably better value.			"

												Two main points.1. I hate that this uses Uplay2. I absolutely love this game.Uplay can be a hassle to deal with, but its nothing compared to how great this game is. The controls are super smooth with a game pad (once you get used to the game physics) and the game itself is gorgeous. I was worried the scenes might get boring and redundant, but the devs did a fantastic job at keeping things fresh. While most levels are an off the center third person view, almost looking over the shoulder, some levels are unique in their views such as the sunrise level (which looks stunning). In addition, I've found some cool easter eggs as well. Wonderful game, but could do without Uplay. Totally worth buying. Seriously. Do it.			"

Maybe ride a tattooed unicorn with a purple mohawk being ridden by a bandana wearing cat holding a pistol sending you any place you can imagine.This game is freakin awesome, the visuals are eye candy its a game of skill thats easy to learn and difficult to master, at the time i wite this the community has over 88,000 maps available to play and you yourself can release your creativity and make a track of your own. Daily competitions for varing rewards, every map in the campaign has 3 challenges to complete that are so random and unrelated to riding you will be asking wtf but in a good way. And personally i have had almost no technical issues with the game, once in a rare while the game freezes but alt ctrl delete and restart fix it every time.

List of good things:*Free 25+ known tracks by me that you need nothing for the online ones (I daubt that makes sense though).*Multiple tracks for no extra purchase (purchase season pass for 4 or something extra worlds for fun).*Getting used to uplay was easy for me, try to enter twice before game starts.*You know, for fun.

												I'd love to hate this game, but I simply can't. As the matter of fact - I love it. At least the first 30 minutes of each gameplay session, until frustration takes the best of me. Unlike other titles, where frustration comes from bad gameplay mechanics, clunky controls or just plain bugs - this game has none of those. Frustration comes only from your own mistakes and lack of focus and patience. I had no problem with the BEGINNER and EASY difficulty mode tracks, whereas in MEDIUM, I first took the time to learn the track and adapt to the ever-changing layout. HARD is where things got really painful. Let's just say that I had to repeat one track a hundred times to get the gold medal. Frustration was followed by a great sense of achievement. I find the new FMX trick system fun, but very difficult or just needed to get used to. One more problem, mentioned by most Steam users: Uplay. Being forced to use two types of DRM is ridiculous and Uplay sucks in general. Sometimes it takes ages to load certain data (bikes, rider accessories and the list of tracks) from the cloud. I bought this game mainly for the purpose of local co-op so I was devastated to find out that you weren't able to play the user-created tracks with your friends. After the latest patch they finally implemented that feature so hopefully we'll have more than the default 10 tracks to enjoy. To sum things up, I enjoy most of the features of Trials: Fusion. Just two things need to go: my lack of skill and Uplay. 9/10			"

												I wouldn't have any problems with it if all that mattered was that you get to the end of the levels, but the structure of the game makes speedrunning the levels very aggravating.  There are about three or four voice acting clips for each level, and they repeat over and over, which makes them tiresome very quickly.			"

												I played hundreds of hours of the previous games on Xbox so I am a fan of the games. Fusion is fun and challenging in the same way that HD and Evo were. Having to run Uplay is a bit annoying but it starts up automatically so it's not that bad.There are some frame rate issues occasionally but I guess that is just from running on PC where other things are happening in the background. Restarting Fusion seems to fix it mostly. "

												Even though the original Trials games fell flat for me, feeling repetitive and lacking in anything resembling an interesting challenge in most of the levels, I nevertheless picked up Fusion after watching some videos of it.After spending two hours on it(which is a about 30-40% through the career mode), I can safely say this is an improvement in every area. The levels are so much more varied and much more entertaining, and Redlynx has really realised that going for low-light environments is a terrible idea. The new levels are bright, futuristic, and so much fun to traverse.Even the soundtrack got a massive beauty treatment; Petri Alanko, famous for his work on Alan Wake, provided an absolutely astonishing lineup of music that sets the mood.

												I recommend Trials Fusion the game, but Trials Fusion for PC is a scam. The game doesn't run properly, it doesn't matter how good your PC is, it's port to the PC is the wost I've ever seen. It's practically unplayable. Trials is all about reaction and skill, imagine how hard it is when the game is constantly dropping to 15-20 fps and going slow motion below 60. The famerate is all over the place at all times for every track. So basically, have fun trying to control your rider as the game is frequently changing speed and frame rate. Even with their updates, lowering your graphics, lowering your resolution, turning off v-sync, turning on frame skipping, setting Trails Fusion to high priority and PC settings to performance, you will only marginally improve it. This game should be removed from Steam for quality control, they sold you a completely broken game that they don't even try to fix, or make good on. Absolutely shameful display of flippant disregard for the PC customers who shelled out the money and can't even make use of it as a paperweight. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. FOR. PC.			"

												Trials Fusion is a fantastic game of realistic futuristic bike riding, Ride in many trials and even select between male or female! Perform crazy stunts and flips with over 6 bikes to choose! Customize your bikes with new body kits, wheels and color! Even customize the look of your rider with new outfits and colors. Unlock the mystery of the chilling Trials Fusion story as you follow it from beginning to end. In the After The Incident DLC, the story is fully explained in the first two tracks. Create your own tracks in the new track editor and share them with others for others to rate. In real life, many do not know this but before the game was made, the producers of the game made actual treasures hidden around the world to find and at first, no one knew about it and some of the treasure has been found. Look up the story on wiki to find out more! And all the DLC tracks are awesome, recommend getting all of them!It's like playing a comedy and it's absolutely hilarious to watch for the viewers, this game will get you hooked! Do get the orignal trials fusion with the season pass, then you don't have to get each DLC separetely.10/10Game Rating: PG (Mild Violence)Catagory: RacingIf anyone wants to do multi together sometime, my Uplay username is Scrletdrgnfly to search for me.

			Trials Fusion is the latest installment in the Trials franchise from Red Lynx & Ubisoft ... A motorbike platforming game that becomes quickly addictive and almost insanely frustrating at the higher...		

Trials Fusion is a worthy addition to the team ... even though the futuristic backdrop feels a little bit against the grain of the series ... there was something special about the redneck vibe that previous games had ... but the graphics and the new types of bikes are pretty damn amazing ...The game follows pretty much the same path as the others ... the easy tracks are really easy ... the hard tracks are really hard ... and I am yet to manage to finish an extreme track ... The addition of the FMX tracks is pretty damn cool as well ... I have found lots of amazing tracks on Track Central - but also some terrible ones ... and this is the way with user created content ... but I don't see myself getting bored of this game any time soon ...Really looking forward to online multiplayer when it finially arrives ...Worth getting ... and looking forward to the season pass DLC content too!Slosh			"

												It's basically Trials Evolution with different models.Just a few criticisms: The new FMX tricks are very clunky. It's difficult to trigger the one you want, some of them make your bike flip wildly when starting or ending the trick, and sometimes your rider just sits there doing nothing when you're trying to activate a trick. As for the level design, there's a lot of little things that ruin it. Later on, there's a bunch of jumps where you have to hit it just right or you'll fail. On paper, it sounds like that's just difficulty, but the bike control can sometimes be frustratingly bad. One of the worst things about the controls is that the bikes are rear wheel drive. If your bike comes an inch off the ground, you won't be able to make the jump. And if you want to get a gold on every level, you'll have to completely restart, because the timing is tight.And then there's the small things. Customization is so lacking that it might as well not be there. You can (supposedly) buy new bodykits and wheels for your bikes and paint them. So there's a whopping two options. The thing it doesn't mention is that half of the bikes either don't have additional bodykits or can't be painted. Rider customization is slightly better, but that's just because you can consistantly paint the different outfit pieces.I've also noticed some bugs, and many, many crashes. For instance, when you restart a level too quickly after finishing it, the level completed popup appears, and won't go away until you reset again. There's plenty of crashes in the editor, which makes it almost unusable until you've learned just which features crash the game.AND THEN THERE'S UPLAY.Uplay is one of the worst things about any Ubisoft game these days, and is the single reason I will not buy another Ubisoft game until they drop Uplay. First of all, changing your name from the automatically generated ""guest-XXXXXXXXXXX"" is a pain, and you won't get the one you want. And then you get to deal with the wonderful servers. The best way I can describe it: Do you remember a time when ""DLC"" was crazy, because there was no way you could download 10MB in a sensible time? Well, Uplay simulates that by taking 10 minutes to download a 10MB update. And then I got to wait another 10 minutes to sync my saves, and then another 10 minutes after playing the game for my saves to sync. I'd like to say I'm exaggerating, but I can honestly say that I'm not.But hey, it's all worth it, because it's totally preventing piracy (assuming you ignore the fact that it was cracked within a day). The thing that always gets me is that I'm sitting here waiting for the game to launch, and someone who just decided to pirate the game is already in the game, for free. It's a noble cause, but it's only hurting the people who are actually paying for it. They're just punishing legitimate players at this point.Basically, it slowly turns into trial and error. I guess I was just expecting more speed and flips rather than precision jumps with clunky mechanics. So if you liked Trials Evolution, you'll like this. If you like putting up with terrible DRM that makes you wait half an hour before you can play the game you payed for, you'll also like this. But with that said, it's $20. You're paying for a budget game, and it definitely does that title justice.Recommendation: Buy it during a sale, and don't expect to play it until after the sale, because Uplay will be slow as hell because of all the traffic.

												Synopsis: The 4th release of the 2.5D motorcross racing game with platform elements, where you shoot the best possible time with the least amount of faults/errors.Genre: Platform RacerYea! Great 2.5D graphics, pick up and play for 5 minutes style, high skill ceiling, support for player created content built in at launch, lots of ways to customize your rider and bike. Very competitive leaderboard game.Meh! Expierienced Trials veteran will find the game very easy to beat up til the Hard/Extreme tracks, skill games are now have to be unlocked and not accessible from own section, less skill games then previous games(probaly will be added via DLC). No launch SLI/Xfire support that causes performance issues.Bleh! Uses UPLAY,some game sections take forever to load, can be very frustrating to some people that could cause rage quits. Seems to be less tracks then previous games but I could be wrongLowdown: If you have a few friends to play with you will have a blast competing against each other's times, which is where all the appeal is. The game also can be quite rewarding as nothing is as awesome as beating a section of the track that you had been stuck on for 100 faults.4/5			"

												I first saw this game when TheBlazeJP did a 100% speedrun during #SGDQ2014,and that speedrun/his speedruns of other Trials games was what got me into playing Trials in the first place,with Fusion being my very first Trials game I've played myself.This game is one of those games where it's addicting and frusterating as hell at the same time(I can guarantee that after 10 hours of playing at the time of this review,trying to get most of the gold medals),but it's really fun regardless.The controls aren't actually that hard to get used to because they're a Happy Wheels style,I guess the only wonky thing being the FMX,but for me the FMX wasn't a huge deal.The skill games are really interesting,each skill game(and each track)having it's own quirks,and those along with the Rider's shouts during every track are some of the funniest/most entertaining parts of the gameIf you're looking for a game that's fun but still really challenging,seriously get this or Evolution,you won't regret it10/10 from me :) "

												this game is capable of rendering a good 60fps on a mid-range gfx card with all visual settings on maximum.but many people complain of poor performance.for whatever reason, this game insists on launching in borderless windowed mode. regardless of your previous settings, this game always launches in borderless windowed mode.while running the game in borderless windowed mode, you will notice that the game loses vsync capability and it appears to revert to 30fps for unknown reasons.so, for most folks, the cure for poor performance in this game should be as simple as this:at any point after you launch the game go to your keyboard, hold the alt key and press the enter key and the game will go into fullscreen mode and your framerate issues should disappear instantly on any mid-range gpu.

												I have played every other Trials game and I was very quickly dissapointed with this game.  Let's first start with optimization.    This game must have a perfect 60fps to run, because if it drops at all, even to 50fps it slows down so much that it is completely unplayable.  I have to set this game to absolute minimun settings and even then I still get massive fps drops.  And my computer can max out Battlefield 3.  Next we have the addition of the trick system.  It is the most god awful thing you can ever attempt to use.  It does not do what you tell it to do and the rider will frequently get stuck in a position.  But apart from the huge gameplay issues, the game is still just not fun or challenging.  This game is so easy that I was able to beat almost every track first try with a gold medal.  The leaning is also very unresponsive in comparison to older games.  The older games were very fun, but they totally blew it with this one.  Complete waste of $20.  Don't buy it.			"

												I have been a long time fan of the Trials series, since the very first flash version on the PC, and have purchased the previous versions of the game on the xbox 360 as well as the PC.  I have to say, the whole DLC business has left me feeling sour, and I don't think I'll be buying future versions of this game.  I bought a season pass because I don't want to keep making microtransactions or buying additional content.  A bunch of mediocre extra tracks were released as DLC, and then suddenly I have to buy additional content?  Much like many other games nowadays it seems like the developers have gone from focusing on delivering a great game and instead focus on how much money they can bleed out of customers.  Also, with the latest updates, the game seems to run very badly now.  It used to run very well on my high specced gaming laptop, but now it fluctuates all over the place with the framerate speeding up and slowing down the game randomly as it pleases.  Get the previous trials games, but I cannot recommend this game, and I'll be avoiding any further releases due to the capitalist greed that's infected so many other games/developers/publishers.  Also, uPlay is the biggest pile of *%$^# ever.			"

												Trials Fusion is an excellent entry to the series. Here's why:RedLynx tried something different this time around, and it works quite well. The trick system is an excellent feature put into the game. It promotes replayability of tracks by having the user see how ""flashy"" of a run they can nail and show off to their friends. It's based off of the famous RedLynx physics engine, making it intuitive, nice to look at, and at some points, silly to observe what may happen during a crash.But beyond the trick system, there's even more in terms of the traditional trials game. There's the usual spike in difficulty, where the last few groups of levels WILL test your patience, skill, and sanity. The levels themselves still keep their usual charm; being put in wacky/amazing environments, seeing things interact around you, it's all here. The environments all look great and there's enough variety to keep you happy.Now there are trick runs, where you have to see how many points you can get on a special track designated for this new system. I like this, because sometimes you want to do tricks on the normal tracks, but you know it may hurt your time. It seems they're trying to cater to those who like to have a little fun in between the serious time trials, and I respect their approach to it. It works for them.Skill games are back, and they're as fun and silly as ever. I don't agree how they made them a requirement this time around, but it's not the biggest issue in the worldEach of the bikes actually has a specific purpose and will be used depending on which track you're participating in. This is WONDERFUL. I remember in evolution you would use one or two bikes, because the only things the new ones did was have more power. I REALLY appreciate RedLynx making each bike unique and useable. There's some really nice biker customization as well. Lots of cool, future-y outfits to choose from. I'm really excited excited to see where the DLC takes this game. Although the game had a less-than-stellar launch, I'm still very happy with this product, and cannot wait to play through more trials. It feels like a trials game through-and-through to me, and that's what matters. It's a quality product that will only get better with more tweaking and additional content. I believe this is completely worth your money if you are a fan of the series.			"

												As other people have described, Uplay is the pubic hair in this otherwise fantastic entree. No experience with the previous Trials games is necessary to instantly (well, after dealing with Uplay) enjoy this game. Unlike traditional racing games, there is no steering. You control only acceleration, braking, and leaning on your supercharged motorcross bike, in an attempt to finish insane levels or interesting challenges. Before you know it, you'll be mashing the convenient ""instantly restart level"" or ""instantly restart at checkpoint"" buttons as you try to figure out how to get just a little more air off that one jump, how to avoid faceplanting on that log, or how to keep up with your friend's ghosts. It is easy to get caught up in the search for perfection on each level because the gameplay is so tight, fun, and rewarding. Highly recommend! WELCOME TO THE FUUTURE "

												I have been a long time fan of the Trials series, since the very first flash version on the PC, and have purchased the previous versions of the game on the xbox 360 as well as the PC.  I have to say, the whole DLC business has left me feeling sour, and I don't think I'll be buying future versions of this game.  I bought a season pass because I don't want to keep making microtransactions or buying additional content.  A bunch of mediocre extra tracks were released as DLC, and then suddenly I have to buy additional content?  Much like many other games nowadays it seems like the developers have gone from focusing on delivering a great game and instead focus on how much money they can bleed out of customers.  Also, with the latest updates, the game seems to run very badly now.  It used to run very well on my high specced gaming laptop, but now it fluctuates all over the place with the framerate speeding up and slowing down the game randomly as it pleases.  Get the previous trials games, but I cannot recommend this game, and I'll be avoiding any further releases due to the capitalist greed that's infected so many other games/developers/publishers.  Also, uPlay is the biggest pile of *%$^# ever.			"

												Bought both base game and Season pass, liked the base game, loved the premise of a game that would get worked upon as time went on.Every DLC has been pretty shoddy, not a whole lot of content, then finally one of them caught my eye (Awesome Level Max).Man, was I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to find out the one thing that would bring me back to the game was behind a new paywall, because RedLynx came up with a new definition of Season Pass, more focused on the Season than the Pass. Not spending another buck in this game, recommend that you avoid it too, this is everything that's wrong with the industry.Oh, and it has microtransactions too.			"

												So, after reading alot of reviews of the Trials series and this game in particular, i feel obligated to write one on my own.Many people had a huge problem with Ubisoft and their way to market their games, in fact those people hate on Trials Fusion just because it uses Uplay. The game is published by Ubisoft, i do not know why you would think they wouldnt put it on their own PC distribution service and account control service. Yes Uplay is sometimes broken, but those times are not THAT often, it happens  here and there, and Ubisoft doesnt seem to give a ♥♥♥♥. But really, i dont want to review the Publisher or the Developers, which both chose to run this game on the platform.The Game Itself:- a very skillbased ""racing"" game, where the point is more or less to drive through a track with no mistakes, only after that the time really matters- has alot of content (though the price with the DLC is pretty high, compared to a triple a title it matches though)-> User created content pushes the game forward to a pretty high replay value (which mostly explains my playtime)Most negative aspects about it:- lack of content of the original game (no dlcs) compared to evolution- no ways of communication directly through the game- the multiplayer is pretty lagged out (though it is much better than evolution)Overall, they needed too long for the game to be at this state (which is a pretty definitve version on how a trials game needs to feel like), it felt like a beta for about a year into it. The developers did not abandon the game though and continued to give (free) content for the players to enjoy. With this in mind, i can only say it is one of my most beloved games today, for its high skillcap and active community, which still produces some great quality tracks. "

												Runs a lot better than its predecessor Trials Evolution. If you're a fan of the previous game then you'll love this. If you haven't had a go, this is a great start.

												Tried the original and thought this would be more of the samem which is something completely deceptive from its appeearance. Most people would assume that it's some racing game about motorcycles but this is not at all the case. It's a physics-based puzzle trial system based on balance and speed control through some really tricky tracks. The whole dirtbike thing is kind of incidental as it's just a vehicle that works for the system. As you progress, these tracks get more and more tricky requiring ever increasing amounts of control. Great game all around but was not expecting Fusion to be as robust a game is it is. Amazing graphics and sound which is a gigantic leap over the original, and it has a soundtrack so good that you can't but to pump it up and groove to it. Really well optimized and a totally pure ""video game"".			"

												I've been a fan of the Trials series for a few years now, but I always run into the same problem. I literary fly through all the easy and medium levels, but when I start the hard ones, the game's just over for me. I have to spend hours to get one done, and have use too many checkpoints. Easy and medium levels I get done in one go most of the times, all gold medals, but the leap to hard is just too much for me.That being said, the game looks amazing and the futuristic style is wonderful.The addition of the tricks didn't feel all that great to me. I like the idea of it, but the excecution can be worked on. Or maybe it's my controller, I don't know.Adding the skill levels at the end of every chapter was new to me, too, and fun! But a lot of times it's hard to understand what they want you to do or the learning curve is to steap. I had a hard time getting trough the one where you had to do tricks before you hit the ground. My rider was flying around like a rag doll, getting stuck on every part of the bike.The ATV's look great, but don't use them online! They're horrible to jump with. It's just the raw power you use them  for.			"

												Do yourself a favour and Ignore all the negative reviews on this game and all the whinging on its Uplay integration (which makes no difference at all). There is no such thing as a bad Trials game! It works fine online AND offline, the classic core gameplay is unchanged, there are a few new additions of course such as the FMX stunt courses and the futuristic theme which I see no problem with.All its a solid title and a successful sequal to Evolution Gold not to be ignored. (just make sure you turn off the in-game music/commentators at the start, they get a little irritating...) Also If you can afford to get the season pass as well then I recommend you do so, the more content the better!			"

												DO. NOT. GET. THIS. GAME! #1 My game refuses to go into full screen mode even after trying multiple different things that usually work: restarting my computer, re downloading the game, and trying to just launch it off of uplay. #2 The game randomly caps out at 30 fps until I fault or restart on a track, even when i have it set to 60 fps. #3 The game randomly pauses and cuts out audio for 10 seconds or so.

												Fun and frustration in the same sentence... that's what Trials Fusion does. Graphics are neat and sharp. Gameplay is fantastic albeit frustrating at times. But gets old quick, nothing too gripping to keep me hooked. I did have issues with Ubisoft but somehow after working through the initial setup, I'm going okay now (touchwood).Bottomline: Buy $5 or less			"

												I approve of this game.The visuals are good, the gameplay feels grippy and responsive and is quite easy for even new players to get into.The music and sound in this game is well done, creative narrating voice that follows you along the many tracks of the game.The only downside of this is that there is no online multiplayer yet, but it will come eventually so until then I would recommend this game to anyone who loves to show off their skill or who love to see their biker slam their head against several concrete walls!

All matches included the same 2 players everytime (i guess big fans who keep playing anyway.The singleplayer is good IF you include the season pass, otherwise the fun will end shortly.

												Honestly, this games has a lot of good things about it, the graphics are a huge improvement over its predecessor and the physics seem a lot more accurate. I could sing its praises all day. However, there are a few things which pull it down. Generally I would say the soundtrack of fusion is a lot worse than that of evolution. it has it's positives but it really couldn't get me as psyched as evolutions. Also, it feels easier. The falls are softer and the bikes are easier to handle. Some would say that's a good thing but i really don't think it is. trials is like dark souls, a game to tear your hair out at. Whereas this I breezed through until the extreme levels. Overall I'd really recommend this game, but maybe not for £16. Under a tenner would be an amazing price however.			"

												This was a great franchise that got absolutely destroyed by Ubisoft and Uplay.  Honestly, still a great game to pick up if you just want to play single player or custom tracks alone.  Multiplayer, however, is non-existant on PC.  There's just simply no one on, because they rushed it out the door without MP and didn't add it for a year, and by that time the game was dead already.  They made sure they rushed out those DLC's, though.  Also, don't buy the DLC.  You get infinite content through the community hub.I played and bought all the DLC's from all the previous Trials games, but supporting Ubisoft's destruction of a beloved franchise just isn't good.

												**Edited August 7, 2015**OKAY REALLY. The game was great on release, i thought. It has some interesting new content and game modes and I really enjoyed the tracks and environment, as well as the map editor. HOWEVER, things changed. This games content is pretty much hidden behind a paywall. The season pass also doesn't even get you all of the DLC and there are micro transactions. Multiplayer took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to show up, and the content sharing system is ♥♥♥♥. This game could have been so much more than what it turned into. ♥♥♥♥ing Ubisoft needs to get away from small developers or rethink their entire business practice, as they clearly don't develop/publish games for the gamers.____________________ORIGINAL REVIEWThe trials games are some of the best games out there in my opinion. They can be great fun if you're not all that great, but take a very long time to master. They provide a lot of good entertainment and have a great community for custom tracks, with near endless possiblities (similar to SC 2 Arcade.) This game continues to deliver. There's a lot of new Rider and Bike customization options which are very fun to mess with.They made Fusion much more competative with friends, too. You are notified if a high score is one upped by a friend, and if you beat a friend it will notify both you and them. You are able to watch replays of all learderboard times which is cool for comparisons or learning tricks. The new challenge system adds 3 challenges to every track that comes with the game. These can make for really hard, but also really entertaining events to each track, or just a little challenge like completing flips.The physics in this game are spot on and I have not found any game that can match the quality. HOWEVER. Ubisoft bought out RedLynx and have inserted Uplay into the question. Uplay is an awful DRM, and requires constant connectivity in order to play any game. Ubisoft tends to have horrible service and I have grown to dislike them greatly recently but that's not why we're here.Pros-Very fun-Well polished-Beautiful New Art Style-Lots of tracks-Challenges to keep you busy and entertained-Multiplayer Local, and Online in a future update.-Tricks can be a very fun additionCons-Uplay-Can be VERY frustrating-Ubisoft-Occasional Frame Drops-Crashes if menu is navigated too quickly sometimes-and uplayI highly recommend this game if you like physics based Bike Racing, Couch Gaming, have patience, and have a good internet connection. I love the trials games, and this one (besides uplay) has not disappointed me at all.			"

												I think the game is fantastic on its own, but if you can buy it on a console, do it. Terrible PC support, very few answers in forums. Bad framerate issues even with high end PC, some tracks worse than others creating progressively worse issues the longer you play the map, while others run fine. After 20 hours of play, I can't even launch the game anymore, and I can't find anything anywhere to help resolve the issue. I've tried re-installing, rebooting computer, you name it, no go.			"

												good game... pretty much same as trials evo gold... harder to run due to better graphics.Original written in 2014. Updated review Dec 2015. It was still in or just out of beta when i first wrote the review and it wasn't as optimized as it is now runs a lot better. I think it was pretty cheesy of them to release a season pass.. that was for first 6 dlc within first year then they released the awesome max content for sale seperately but.. it is what it is.. I caught the wording when I bought the deluxe edition.. the part about the season pass being for first year or however they worded it so I knew they had the chance to release more dlc seperate than the deluxe edition.

												I love Trials games. My first was Trials 2: Second Edition back in like 2008. I got the demo, played the crap out of it, and bought the game. Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and bought it as soon as it did. This game was AMAZING. The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. Once I had all of them cleared, I saw on Facebook that Trials Fusion was in the works, and excitedly waited for it's release. After pre-ordering this game, and launching it the first time, I was immediately disappointed. The soundtrack is terrible (maybe not a big deal for you), loading took forever, and the bikes/rider/maps/tracks/menus all look really thrown together without much thought. My opinion, of course, but if you're going to get a Trials game, get Trials Evolution: Gold Edition. That game is the SH**.			"

												It always really bugs me when people low-ball the ratings for things because it didn't work for them. But in this case I think the technical issues are bad enough to be a non-starter. To clarify, the underlying game is a blast, from what I played, but to get 25 minutes of gameplay I had to put in about 3 hours of troubleshooting across two different (and very normal) computers, a PC and a laptop. There's a solid mix of server problems (uPlay AND another Ubisoft connection, both of which can, and for me did, fail often) which immediately reset your saved progress (it's always-online), graphics problems, and start up problems; all persistent across both computers. More irritating, the demo worked fine after a bit of work, and the full game did not: the demo uses uPlay but seems to save itself a lot of trouble by not attaching your progress to your account.I love the hell out of trials. But this game is hard enough to even start playing to make me wary of any future uPlay thing. It's more headache than the fun is worth.			"

												The game is not as good as the first titles. They took the old core concept and slaugthered it: You have to pay real money for optical upgrades like this is a free to play title. The season pass needs to be seperately activated within uplay (another software/account for gaming) and does not include the last DLC they released (WTF IS A SEASON THEN?!?) and the local coop (the games selling point imho) is worse than the previous titles (less tracks,less player made tracks). i strongly recommend to NOT buy this!!!

												Welcome to the future! I have not played earlier trials games so I can't compare them to this game but overall I'm not a huge fan. I was led to this game by the app trials fronteir. I did enjoy the app but for anyone who thinks this game is like the app it is not. I was hoping to be able to upgrade the individual bikes a little more but you just get the bike. The only thing you can change is the way the bike looks, but not the actual traction of wheels or engine or anything else. And there are only a few bikes to choose from. It's a fun game to play every now and then but I can't see myself committing more than 30 minutes at a time to this game.			"

												Railroads you into installing uplay which is very unimaginative clone of steam, and of every other app-store ever invented. However ubisoft have seen it reasonable to attempt to remove your personal choice of which app-sore you would like to use.

Some levels you have to go full throttle through the whole thing to not die. The mechanics and physics in the game is amazing and well done. It does take some time to get used to how to move and stuff. Its great to play around with friends and see how you stack up against them. Highly Recommended!			"

												I'm a bit sad that I can't really reccommend this. I wanted more Trials, just to get rid of the shakes, but this.. This is most likely not the ""More Trials!"" you are looking for. Play Trials Evloution instead, if you have not done so and/or wait for the next one, where they hopefully tune some of the stuff back to ""functionaltiy over visuals"".Pros:- Graphics are amazing. Really, really pretty.- Still the same great Trials physics, bike handling feels almost exactly like the previous onesCons:- UPLAY-- This piece of garbage. BigPicture & COntroller -> Start any UPlay game -> Wait for Uplay updates & start looking for the mouse to click ""Start"". The day UPlay dies will be a happy one. Make a suicide pact with Origin please, why don't you. - Visuals over functionality-- Camera too often shows the scenery instead of the track you are about to land on-- Performance was never great with the Trials games, but because of the grat graphics and their camera work, Fusion performs HORRIBLE at times - which really sucks in a skill based ""pixel perfect"" thing, when you fail because of lag/hitches- ""Trick Mode"" is just bad. Right stick to perform stunts w/ the bike while in the air. Sounds nice, controlls horrbily. HORRIBLY.-- These levels are mandatory and mixed in with the normal Trials stuff and that sucks, because it just does not work wellI like trials more than I'd normaly publicly admit to, but this.. Yes, Trials should feel frustrating. But not because some Designer went ""Hey stop showing so much of the track, show the background, we spent a lot of money making this!"". They essentially broke their game with that attitude, about 50% of all levels I have played have had this. I am at about halway through, and between that and the Trick stuff, this is it for me, and I am actually a bit sad about this.. I want more real Trials.. :/Also, that intro Song.. O.oNext time, just make Trials Evloution 2, yes? Everyone will love you again and actually play your game..Thanks! :)			"

												I got this as part of the arcade pack a while ago, and kinda forgot about it.  Today I felt in the mood, having played some Trials HD back in the day.I start it up, and FIRST THING, it takes me to dlc.  It literally shows the menu where you'd pick levels, and automatically scrolls over to the paid content.  If I hadn't gone searching in disbelief, I could easily have been fooled into thinking that this game contains no career ""on-disc"", so to speak.Once i figured that out, I was puzzled that I'd gone and downloaded a free-to-play game without realizing.  It even has premium currency and expects you to buy outfits (which are also listed before the ones the game comes with).Everything about this screams money-grubbing, consumer-hating, can't-find-our-butts-with-both-hands-and-a-flashlight corporate stupidity.  I feel like I paid someone to spit in my face.Maybe the rest of the game is good, but I have no idea.  I'll never play it again.  There's a hell of a lot more game out there that actualy, you know, COME WITH THE GAME IN THEM.Ubi's gonna have to something pretty damn amazing to get me to install their pathetic U-play BS again.

												In my short time playing it so far, I had a really enjoyable experience.The visuals in the game are great, especially on high graphic settings. The game plays well with a keyboard, it feels fluid and nice. The tracks included with the game have awesome futuristic designs, and I'm sure there will be many amazing user created tracks soon. I've yet to try the editor but if it's anything like the one in Trials Evolution or even better, I can't wait to try it out.The game also has some cool music, the main menu soundtrack is sweet! "

												I was really looking forward to playing Trials Fusion but in its current form the game is simply broken. The game speed is fixed to the frame rate which I assume is because it is a (rather bad) PS / XBox port. So if the framerate drops from 60 to 40 it runs at 2/3 of the correct speed. This means that a) you need a superb gaming system (forget about the minimum requirements) and b) all comparisons to other players or friends are complete bs. This is a reaction-based game, yet anyone can just crank up the graphics and play in slow motion, taking twice as long to position the rider. Apparently the developers are working on this but I recommend you stay away from the PC version until this is fixed.			"

Even if you can play other games with equal or even better graphics than this game, ubisoft decided that you wont be able to play, because this is such a graphic revolution for a game that only choosen people with newer graphic cards are allowed to play the game.

												Having liked this genre of games in the past.. I really went in wanting to like this game. From the onset it looked like similar games, such as trial evolution, etc.. but much more massive in scale. Well, it is massive... that is for sure. It has tons of tracks, content, and multiplayer.. but along the way it lost it's fun, challenge, and excitement and ends up being a poor reproduction of a classic. Whereas in previous games, you could mess up and still not crash, or choose your path, etc.. this game is exteremly linear.. a do it this way or die pattern quickly emerges. That ruins all the fun and charm of the previous games. So after a few basic levels.. you start getting it.. and once you realize it is.. ok.. do this now.. then do this. ok now this.. it becomes boring and bland. Save your money and pick up trials evolution or one of the other ones.. as this one, try as it might, is actually the worst of the lot.			"

												The game is like an ipad game moved to the PC, it only runs in so little resolution that its like playing on the ipad but i cant forcefully press my fingers on the screen, unless its me trying to smash that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥'s head in the main menu out of frustration. It then makes me feel worse at the people playing this game saying it looks great and is fun, while im sitting here watching my guy go in slow motion as a mash the A button madly doing backflips and jerk off with my tears. I feel like an idiot staring at the tiny screen that the game runs on and it doesnt help that the rest of the game wont run at normal speed unless it looks like pong and trials HD had gay sex in a back alley. I dont think anybody should buy this game due to my problem but who gives a ♥♥♥♥ Trials can ♥♥♥♥ in a potato, cook it for 5 hours and slam it in a case and name it Trails Fusion and everybody wil buy it anyways.

												Trials Evolution Gold was a great game, Trials Fusion is a really good example of how you can screw up a game.it feels sterile, we play the 4 player local coop, and it was no fun at all.

												It's a good game, but it's not as good as Trials Evolution. That game was very long and offered so much deversity in the modes and level design. Add the crazy amount of unique user created levels, multiplayer and you have a classic.Cons - Fusion is a pretty short game and the heavy handed futuristic theme is off putting after a while. If I have to hear that, welcome to future song one more time, ugh! The DLC has been pretty nice but they're short levels and not worth the price. The selection of user created levels is limited and not very interesting so far. No online multiplayer and the local multiplayer is a shallow experience. The later levels get ridiculously hard.Pros - It's still a Trials game and the controls are awesome. The new trick feature done with the analog sticks is a welcomed addition. The soundtrack during the levels are pretty sweet. So I still have to recommend it if you're a Trials fan, but I'd wait till i goes down in price.			"

												I bought this game thinking ""wow it looks so fun and I can't wait to play it"". I bought the deluxe edition and started the game. or at least I tried to. It took me to the Uplay account login screen. I signed up for Uplay thinking I would be able to play the game after signing in. But no, I can't connect to a Uplay server. I thought, ""okay, i'll just play in offline mode"". But no, I have to launch it in online mode once before I can play in offline mode. So, I thought to myself. I just wasted 39.99 dollars on a game I can't even play. Until I can find a way to get Uplay working, i'm going to think to myself ""wow, I just wasted 39.99 dollars on a game that was going to be awesome but I can't play because Uplay can't connect to servers."" I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a working Uplay account.			"

												(Please note that I am downvoting this as a sequel if you have played previous Trials games. If you have never played a trials game before then you won't understand why i think this one is a failure so go ahead and play it.)As a standalone game this would be amazing. I'm a big fan of the Trials series (go to hell Uplay and Ubisoft with it). However this one just doesn't stand up to the previus installments. It's clear ubisoft was trying to appeal to the ""new generation"" with all the techno bits and futuristic looking backdrops, which I guess is standard for Ubisoft nowadays isn't it? I really like the solid color art style in other games like portal or Mirror's Edge, but it feels kind of out of place her. That's nto to say it's completely out of place as it still works. but as a long time player I miss the gritty and harsh art style of old. Just my preference though.*Important* If you were hoping to find those unforgetably cool tracks like the one's from Evolution and HD then you will be disappointed. The tracks leave something to be desired and I breezed through all of them fairly easily. There's no Castle Crash or Gigatrack or Archipeligo. I rememebr most if nto all the tracks from Trials HD and Evolution by simply hearing the name but i couldn't even tell you the names of th first few tracks in Fusion. This is rather big for me as I really wanted the memory hook that previous tracks had given me. They give each difficulty a general ""Theme"" for example the second area you unlock is supposed to be in the city but I couldn't be less enthusiastic about the environments. They just seem copy and pasted together and I turned off the audio because I didn't find ""Cindy"" or that pother guy i couldn't bother to remember the name of.If this sounds like I'm calling Ubiusoft out on being the dirtbags they so desperately desire to be then you may be on to something there. But I still LIKE the game I'm just not in love with it like i was the previous ones, and if a sequal can't superceed it's predocessors then it's a failure as a sequel.But I am sure we will see more of Trials as Ubisoft has made it clear that there are no such things as standalone games anymore.Go to hell Ubisoft and takle your piece of ♥♥♥♥ excuse for a ""Client"" with youAlso i would be nice if steam had a spell check, I knwo that's lazy but I'm legally blind so proof reading is too much of a hassle			"

												Don't waste your time with Fusion. If you're a very experienced Trials player, it can take less than 2 hours to reach the Trials Trophy.

												WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.Bought this as it was cheap in trhe Summer Sale and I own and love the game on my PS4, big mistake. As if it wasn't awkward enough to try and run in the first place (thank you Ubisoft, I totally wanted UPlay), it then crashed every time I tried to progress beyond the start menu, and every 'fix' I found online didn't work. So after racking up a tidy 0.4 hours play time just on the main screen, I decided it just wasn't worth the hassle and requested a refund.			"
