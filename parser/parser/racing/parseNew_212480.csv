												You won't believe it... but, this is the best arcade racing game in the recent years.The transformation mechanics looks gimmicky, but it really matters and makes the game more interesting. You must not only learn handling the cars: boats and planes control extremely differently each other making the game more deep and enjoyable.The tracks are extremely well designed, both visually and technically. There are some noob friendly courses like Carrier Zone and some strongly skill indexing ones like Burning Depths or Adder's Lair. Tracks are also changing lap after lap, which is very refreshing to the standard racing formula.For many people this game may be very hard to complete on 100%. The AI isn't messing around - you WILL get hurt. But, you need to know - winning in this game is SO satisfying. You must fight all the time and even is you lose 9 times, then the 10th winning attempt will greatly repay you above your former investment. This is highly skillful game - the difficulty curve ends EXTREMELY high unlike other new racing games.NO BLUE SHELL. Automatic positive. Weapons are very well balanced for the kart racing. There is still bit of luck, however is less emphasized than in the other games from this genre.The main draw of this game is an online mode. When it works fine it is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunely there are many disconnection and lag problems that may make you Rage Quit for a while. That's not good by any means, but there is a high chance that you will get over it. The community is handling some bi-weekly tournaments so don't forget to drop on by!Overall, game is remarkably fun with bunch of refreshing mechanics that you will love to explore and use for your advantage. I highly recommend this game, especially for non-Sega fans, because this game is far FAR more than a simple fanservice you would expect.			"

												Imagine driving through a port that has airships docked. When the port ends, you drive off of a cliff only to have your car turn into a jet. After you come down and complete a lap expecting to see the same thing, a giant airship has crashed into the port. Forcing you to drive into a path unknown, the river below where your car morphs into a boat. Mines drop into the water, sending waves that you and your rivals then need to traverse the dynamic water. On your third lap around, the airships get engaged in battle and have completely destroyed the port, causing you to have to fly through burning airships and find your way around the crashing behemoths. As you're dominating the competition on the third lap, you can hear the fans chant your name.This is Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. Every race might be three laps with many paths, but the second and third laps usually deviate in a big way from the first. You won't just be driving cars around the 20+ courses (40+ with mirrored mode), but you'll be piloting ships and jets. The tracks are gorgeous. Themed and inspired from classic SEGA games like Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, Shinobi, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Afterburner, Nights and many more. Even lesser known games like Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg get their own track. A lot of love and detail went into this game and it shows. Bright colors for some tracks, realistic lighting and texture for others. There is something here for everyone. The controls are easy yet difficult to master. Left thumbstick to steer, a button to use items, a button to look back, right stick to do tricks in mid air, right trigger to speed up and left trigger to slide / drift. Drifting around corners will not only tighten your turn radius, but if you hold it for long enough, it will boost your speed when you come out. Every character has his or her own stats: Speed, acceleration, handling, boost and all star. These stats balance out drivers. The All-Star determines how frequently you will get it from the items. When you have it, you're temporarily turned into a jet.Since this is a 'kart' style game, there are items that you'll pick up from floating red orbs. The fire crackers launch forward and bounce off of walls.  There are ice balls that come in threes and will first stun opponents. Hitting them with more ice freezes them longer. A hot rod that will give you a temporary speed boost and you can detonate it, making a ring of fire around you. A drone that will follow the driver you've selected. You can even change the driver by pointing at a new one. A simple speed boost. A spiked blowfish that you can leave on the course. Finally, one of the most creative weapons, a swarm that will charge forward and will put giant wasps on the course. It will cause drivers to weave through them.Each of these weapons can get fired ahead of you or behind you. Making everything valuable and useful. How do you defend against all these things? Well you can evade them, but there is also a glove that will catch projectiles. Not just that, but then you can throw them back.With all these weapons, they don't feel like they'll cause a winner. The game still feels skill based. The last driver won't get an item that will drop them off at first place. There is no item that will seek out and rob whomever is in the lead. It is possible that you can take such a lead that no weapon can overtake you, only your own bad driving will lose you the lead. You can also fall so far behind that nothing will bring you to the others.As you play through the game, the characters you play as will get experience. When a character levels up, he or she gets a modification. Simple things like handling or speed. They give you an extra point, but because the game feels balanced, they take away a point from something else. It is a nice system, especially when considering multi-player balance.There are boosters marked with purple arrows in the air, water and the track to move you faster. That's not the only way though. When you are in the air, you can do a trick by using the right thumb stick. If you land the trick you get a boost. If you fail, you get slowed down. The game avoids crashes. Even if you fly off the track, the screen just wipes and puts you back in the game. The tricks have another purpose when you're in the air. Left and right do barrel rolls. Up and down do flips. This makes sure that you don't jump off the track.Sega makes use of its rich history and there are plenty of drivers. Characters from Sonic's series, Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Football Manager, Nights, Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon, Rome: Total War, Space Channel 5, Team Fortress 2 (three characters as one), an unlockable famous real life racecar driver and so many more. Wreck it Ralph is even here straight from the animated movie! Even if you've never heard of Sega or Sonic, there's always someone here to recognize. It is a huge roster of drivers and thankfully a lot of them are unlockable throughout the game's various modes.There are career modes that have your typical Grand Prix with 5 cups that have 4 races each. Each race generally lasts around 5 minutes. Complete all 5 of the Grand Prix and earn mirrored track mode. The main game mode is the World Cup that has you participating in a lot of different events for stars. You will unlock events on a sort of map. When you take part in the event you set easy, medium or hard. Each new victory will give you a star. Easy gets you one star, hard gets you three. These stars are to progress and to unlock new drivers.But with the World Cup, you don't just race. There is a whole slew of events. Drifting challenges, time challenges, battle challenges that have you destroying other racers, traffic attacks where you need to dodge other cars, vs races that pit you against another driver, ghost races that have you competing against game developer ghosts, ring races that have you flying through rings and even a perusing a tank boss to destroy it. There is a lot of variety here and I for one appreciate it.On top of that, you have local co-op and online co-op that finds you matches based on what mode you want. There are typical races, battle arenas and a few others. The process is pretty streamlined. You vote on a track from three random tracks. Then select your driver, view their license to see how good your competition is. Then you race to see who is the best.For every achievement you unlock, you get a sticker. You can place 3 stickers on your license as a flaunt or a personalization that tells other players about you at a glance. There is still in depth information to everyone, which is always nice. When you win, your online rating goes up, when you lose it goes down. It is all a nice system.When you head into a race in Grand Prix and multiplayer, you can play a slot machine for buffs. These buffs are things like ice doesn't slow you as much. You get a glove every lap. Things that mix it up, but really doesn't make anyone overpowered. The slot machine is a diversion during the loading screen. How do you get coins for the machine? On the track there are coins every so often that you can pick up. Not just that, but when a driver is hit with a weapon or falls off the track, they leave a coin. This rewards aggressive players. Plus someone else can always sneak in to take the coin.This game has a lot of content that puts it somewhere at the top of the heap when it comes to combat cart racing. While it has weapons, it is skill in the subtleties of the game that will win you races. Every track has its own flair and is a thing of sheer beauty. It is a lot of fun for anyone that needs something different yet similar to Mario Kart. It feels like a genre that was sorely missing from Steam and Sega didn't just fill that void, they hit a home run with it.			"

												My most treasured friend, who changed my life, gave me this game during her birthday. Without me having no idea what it was going to be about, I assumed it would have been another clone of Mario Kart, so I just wanted it for the online. But, I was astonished...YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A KART RACING GAME LIKE THIS.Before I explain why this is my favorite game on steam and my Game of The Year for 2013, I'd like to give a bit of history of my experience with Kart Racing games. I've been a huge kart racing fan since SNES's Super Mario Kart. They're fun to play especially with friends but I felt they lacked something. As technology advance with the introduction of online, modern kart racing games had online sessions where you can play with others. I remember waking up early at 5am to playing Mario Kart Wii to play with a friend via online. It was fun playing with her causally, but when we played 1 v 1. The experience was boring and it felt like just playing a normal racing game since the items weren't made for 1 v 1. This made me realize that the fact is that many contemporary Kart Racing games such as Mario Kart and other MK clones aren't designed to be intense, fast or competitive. If you tried to play competitive 1 v 1, you're going to get a boring experience because modern kart racing games are design to be with 10+ players with explosives items and just pure luck. Basically, anyone can play, blindly, and it manage to win. Some may like it, but I felt it was boring because it lacked challenge.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the exact opposite because it is a immensely fast, competitive, challenging kart racing game. It is a game you can pick up and expect to get your butt kicked at Normal level. If you think Hard is impossible, this game offers Very Hard mode which will test your skills. It requires mastering maps and developing skills while fantastic music playing. It's like if someone mixed F-Zero with Mario Kart.Unfortunately, where the game fails is that it does not any introduction or tutorial. I highly recommend checking out guides before playing. But when you begin to master the game, you'll realize just how good, if not better, competitive kart racing games than causal fun kart racing games.  What Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does what many kart racing games fail such is  combine map advantages, fair items, and skills together. Majority of these maps are designed for a player to use the map at their advantage such as drifting and stunts. Stunts are tricks you can perform with your right analog. Performing more than one will reward a player with a high tier boost. Drifting also plays a key role as if a player has better drifting skills than others, they're able to drift smoothly and avoid crashes and hazards. Mixing the two together can give you a insane amount of speed up to a level 6 boost. If you have some skill in stunts and drifting, you'll be able to destroy any novice played easily and make an entire lobby receive a ""Did Not Finish""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's items are some of the most balanced fair items I've seen on a kart racing game. Any of the items are very easy to avoid just by drifting and preforming a stunt. There items that shoot directly, set traps, or just gain boosts. The most interesting is the Bees or Sky tigers. They can either target first place or shoot back, but what it does is spread a ton of bees that blocks or hits 1st player. BUT, if you're really good at the game, you can drift and slide your way out of the hazard or any item.Being more specific, the game introduces Boats and planes. Boat, for example, is almost like karts, but you use the water at your advantage. You're able to do stunts when falling off a cliff or bouncing out of the waves to gain an incredible amount of speed. In my opinion, boat and kart are very similar. On the other hand, a player can also use a plane where it opens creatively for the player. There are almost no restrictions and you can fly how you want. All three, the player is able to drift, stunt, and preform a variety of skills to gain speed. What makes the game play different from other kart racing games is that the game rewards you for taking risks, which pushes you to try your best and learn how to go faster. If you try to avoid crashes and hazards uses boosts, you get a risk boost or stunt boosts. This gives a player new idea to get better at the game. What I love the most is that there is no ""best"" path or road. Majority of the paths in maps are balanced and you could take any path you want and still win. It all depends on your skills.In addition to all this crazy talk about drifting, stunts, and skills, Transformed's maps are some of the best kart racing maps. Rather than looping around the same track three times, the maps actually change as you progress. While the graphic or textures on the maps aren't that great compare to today's graphics, the map's environment is where it shines. If you notice that majority of the maps have some kind of action going on. Even maps that have the same track such as Carrier zone something happen such as planes flying back and forth while there explosions happening. AND, a huge missiles flies up to the sky. It just looks amazing. There even maps where the track changes entirely. There a map where you're just racing and if you look in the sky, there actually a battle happening, at the same time. In your second lap, the plane crashes and the players racing are force to use the water to continue the race. Just as you reach your final lap, a dragon destroys the track and you have to take plane. It sounds insane, right? Some of these maps, you actually feel like you're playing the actual SEGA game where it came from especially if you played the game such as Nights Into Dream's Dream Valley map. These are seriously some of the most creative unique maps I've ever played on.With great maps comes segantic (fantastic) music! This game offers a variety of abandon songs from Sonic games like You can Do Anything to obscure songs like Carrier Zone to remastered remixes from very old SEGA titles such as Space Harrier. If grew up playing SEGA games, this game will satisfy all your music needs and you'll remember all those valuable moments you had playing your old SEGA games. It does not matter if you played a SEGA game, you'll be nodding your head to the tunes. Some of these songs are addicting such as Race of Ages, Carrier Zone, or Amigo's Spanish song. What I love about these songs is that they improve the game play significantly as they make the game play more suspenseful, intense and climactic. For example, I've played with players who are WAY better than me, but what I was impressed was the fact that I did not care about 1st place. I just wanted to beat the person that was preventing me from getting the closest place. There moments when I was battling against a player trying to keep a place and I eventually beat the person, but laugh when I realized that I was fighting for 4th place. I simply did not care about getting 1st place, it was all about having fun and trying to beat your friends or rivals. I've seriously had some of the best intense moments in this game that no other game can offer. It's like being a driver of the ending of a Fast and Furious movie where it all comes to your skills. What really impressive me is the fact that many players seem to enjoy the game's contribution to old SEGA titles that went and bought old SEGA titles they loved from Transformed. SUMO Digital or SOL did a wonderful job showing their love for their SEGA best classics. You can tell a ton of love, and effort when building this game.Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed should be on history for separating kart racing games from Mario Kart Clones and try something entirely different. Now, there causal racing and competitive racing.			"

												In a time of despair, betrayal and greed within the video game industry, a holy beacon of light appeared out of nowhere, summoned by SEGA.This light was called Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, a game built upon skill, experience and nimbleness. Following the template of ´95 games, this game is the proof of gaming culture reborn. With fantastic music, levels with incredible contrast, and gameplay so amazingly well built, you would be missing out one of the greatest and most fun multiplayer port one could think of. For your own sake, and the sake of realising that high quality games still exists, you need this game more than you think. This game is seriously good. Ever play Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing, or Burnout? Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed basically combines all of the good elements of these games, and does a great job of having characters you actually want to see from both in the Sega universe and not in the Sega universe.Most of the item weapons are counterable, INCLUDING the 1st place screw you item: THE BEES THE BEEEESS. I think everyone has a deep loathing of Mario Karts Blue Shell aka “bend over and prepare your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or get into 2nd place for 90% of the race dammit. I am giving the Hot Rod item the screw you award though, it can be extremely cheap. The transform theme also bleeds into the tracks. The tracks actually change shape and even switch up when you transform, and it does it in very creative ways. For example, the one track gets blown to bits by an invading force, making you transform to plane for the last lap. This game easily ranks up there as one of the best goofy kart racers of all time! I mean, really, when this game has Team Fortress 2 characters and Wreck-It Ralph as kart racer options, how can you hate this game? HOW?!			"

												I honestly can't think of any flaw in this game. It sets out to do something and does it perfectly. The graphics are great, the handling is great and track desgin is great. It's just so colorful and bright that it's simply pure joy to play. My only regret is the fact that i'm not too familiar with characters and especially track locations. I know most of the Sonic ones and the Skies of Arcadia one is pure pefection, but some i don't recognize. It offers wide range of chalenges and difficulties for all types of gamers and runs smooth like butter on my piece of crap PC.Definitelly THE kart racer on Steam, I recommend it to anyone who's looking to have some fun.

												Fantastic kart/arcade racer! I bought it on a whim during the Steam Summer Sale and almost immediately became hooked. The way the courses evolve and incorporate the 3 different vehicle types blew my mind the first time I played each, and the controls and gameplay are top-notch in my opinion. Beyond that, having put in 300+ hours, I still have so much to learn to maximize my speed on each track - all the tricks and techniques one can employ to maximize boosts is incredible! On top of all that, there is still an active community for this game that, while not the largest, has been so amazingly helpful and friendly! Only downside is that one does tend to experience a number of network error disconnections while playing online, but usually one can just rejoin the lobby for the next race by simply restarting the game and entering the lobby again.Tl;dr: If you enjoy kart/arcade racers at all, I highly recommend this game!

												I've played this game with a couple of friends a bunch over the last couple of days, and have played a ton of it on a different console, and I can simply say that this might be the best Kart Racer ever made. It takes everything good about Mario Kart, gives you more ways to increase your speed based on your skill, and has many different ways to play any character allowing you to play with anyone you like and have your optimal stats.The course design, give or take a level or two, is always on the point. There's nothing more satisfying than learning a course and being able to flip and drift constantly. The ways the courses are laid out and change really allows you to visually tell how much better you're getting at playing, and it's always a nice feeling.The graphics of the game also manage to shine quite well. With a well optimized engine allowing for nearly anyone to play, it's almost a surprise how good this game manages to look. The small details in everything from the Casino Park level to the Jet Set Radio level pop out quite nicely, and manage to look good even at top speeds.The gameplay of the game is fun, simply put. I really can't think of another way to put it. The items are fun to launch at your friends or enemies, and they can all be avoided with other items or skill. If you dislike Mario Kart simply because of the blue shell, this might be your game. All three of the vehicle types are also perfectly balanced, and feel great to play with. It's just fun watching your car swiftly turn into a plane and then continue flying against your opponents. If you're looking for a game to sit around and play with a bunch of friends online, I would highly recommend this one. It just never gets old.			"

												First off I want to say that I am not a Sonic fan nor really of racing games, yet I loved this game.This game reminds me of Mario Kart, it has alot of elements which need to be mentioned:The level design is great and very creative which also keeps the game from getting dull.Bots have great difficulty adjustments, you will have to work up your skill and learn the game before you can win against the harder AI.The graphics is clear and beautiful with a high definition cartoony smoothed out look, which runs smooth, and should run even on low end machines.The vehicle handling in this game is incredible feels like a real arcade gameFairly balanced customizable characters to choose from heaps from which you will recognise, each having their own vehicle look and transformation which is a nice touch.COOP CAMPAIGN (This is something I haven't seen done much, and it is one of the features which I had the most fun and makes this game stand out from other games in general). The campaign itself is very creative with having modes I have never seen doen before like 'Traffic Attack' (reaching checkpoints dodging traffic) 'Drift mode' (drift on marks on the ground that give you extra time to reach the end) 'Versus' (Go head to head against waves of bots and take them out or get ahead of them before they take you out)  'Boost challenge' (drive over the boost marks on the ground to reach the end before time runs out). So many more.. But what makes this better is that you can do all this with your friends together and unlock new maps and characters which keeps you locked in the game trying to beat bosses and progress through the campaign.The transformation with the kart, to boat, to air vehicle works great and just makes the game more original.A game you should definately play split screen with friends and one you can challenge yourself to reach your All Star potential. 9/10			"

It's supposed to be a second-rate Kart Racer that you bought for two bucks because you were drinking too much and thought that buying ironic Kart Racers was hilarious.What's actually here though is polished, well-presented experience.

												Likely the best kart racer on PC. Sonic Racing Transformed's gimmick, the changing tracks & vehicle transformations is well executed, with each of the 3 vehicle types (car, boat, plane) feeling different, although the water driving feels a bit iffy. The tracks themselves are also generally very well made, with all of them very closing resembling the stages from the games they take inspiration from.The game also has a pretty good roster of characters from the sega stable, including   characters from sonic, Jet Set Radio, Skyes of Arcadia, and even PC exclusives like Football Manager and Heavy/Pyro/Spy from TF2, and while not that different from eachother, they still have small differences.Lastly, perfomance wise, it's one of the better ports I've seen. PC's from 2008 will run this game just fine @ 60FPS or nearly that with most eyecandy on max.			"

												Am not the best at racing games but this game is sweet. It has a lot of cool, cute and fun characters to play as and a lot of racing maps. I like the graphics, the effects and how friendly it looks but do not be fooled because once the race starts it is WAR. The other races will do what it takes to win which makes it a lot of fun and this is not a typical racing game because some maps you also fly or are on water. This game takes the experience to another level when you play it beside friends! I would recommend this game if it goes on sale but do not pay full price for it.			"

You will swear, you will scream, you WILL verbally and potentially physically assault anyone who blows you up.Blowfish will become your most hated sea creature that ever lived!So I challenge you all.

												Absoultely amazing, completely addictive kart racing game that blows Mario Kart out of the water. The Steam version of Sonic and All-Stars racing Transformed is the best one by far, just for being able to run at 60 FPS if you computer can support it. Seriously, it just looks so much faster and feels so much better than the console versions. Gameplay modes include the amazing World Tour, where you take on various missions and collect stars to unlock more characters and modifications for their vehicles. Grand Prix, your standard Mario Kart style mode where you compete in a series of races and try to get more points than the other guys. Time Attack, where you attempt to get the fastest lap on a track. The game also has online matchmaking in the form of standard races, Arena where you can compete in the game's 3 arena modes: Battle Race (like a regular race, but you are knocked out after taking 3 hits), Battle Arena (takes place on special combat-based maps and try to shoot the other guys and stuff), and Capture the Chao (find a Chao and deliver it to its destination, while others try to bump into you and steal it), and Lucky Dip, which is a mix of the two modes and also includes Boost Race (tracks have more boost pads, but no items will spawn). Online is fairly populated in the Race lobby, but seems to be sort of dead on Arena and Lucky Dip. A word of warning: Make SURE you at least play through World Tour before going online! There are plenty of VERY skilled players online, and you'll want a decent grasp of the tracks and the controls before taking them on. Thankfully, the community is one of the best i've seen in any online game; I've nearly doubled my Steam friend list just from playing this! The top players have written plenty of guides for this game if you're having trouble; be sure to check them out.Unfortunately, since this game uses the same peer-to-peer networking as the console versions, lag can rear its ugly head. Its two major manifestations take the form of collisions that send your car flying, and several-second pauses that can throw you off guard. It doesn't happen every race, but it can show up, so be prepared.Overall, just a great game, never thought I'd put so many hours into this, but I just can't stop! VERY recommended purchase!			"

												When this game came free to play for the weekend, I gave it a try, I've enjoyed all the sonic games for the Game boy consoles and thought that I should give this game ago, when I stalled it I was amazed with the graphics in the game; not the best but I think they awesome for the type of game, which brings a lot of visual towards the amount of fun you can have in the game.It's not just racing in your kart, you get vehicle transformation, kart (Land) Boat (Water) Plane (Air) all character will have different vehicles and looks which makes the game more fun.You'll say to your self, I'll do one game on Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed and you'll end up on it for hours.I would also recommend using a controller for this game as you can get a lot more fun out of it... (depends on your gaming style)100% worth buying this game! "

												When most people simply glanced at the game, it is easy to look at it as just another mascot kart racing game.  With character racers like Crash Team Racing, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and especially Mario Kart, one would think that that there is nothing more to do.  However, by taking a closer look, it becomes clear that there is more than meets the eye.While the various characters will get your attention, the vehicles that they drive are the important detail.  Depending on the track, the drivers will use either the classic go-kart, a speedboat, or a fighter jet.  Using various vehicles was used in other games like Diddy Kong Racing, but Transformed taking it a step further.  In most cases, the tracks consist of multiple terrains.  Mario Kart has changing terrains, but your kart does not change with it.  If you go into the water, you end up driving in the water, but it is still in kart form.  If you go into the air, a hang glider comes out to extend your jump, but it still counts as more ground racing instead of real aerial races.  In this game, when going from one terrain to another, the vehicles will change accordingly to match it.  That means if your kart goes into the water, the kart will change into a speedboat.  If you hit a big ramp, it will now become a fighter jet.  With your vehicle changing throughout the race, it makes the vehicles more interesting than usual.The vehicles are not the only thing that transforms in this game.  As you race progresses, the tracks will change along with it, a feature few racers ever did.  In one prime example, Dragon Canyon, each lap has its own feel.  In lap one, you will start by driving along wooden bridges and rock roads.  Partially into lap two, a giant rock will block the road forcing the racers onto an unstable water route with waves, rocks, and waterfalls.  On the final lap, a dragon will blow up the wooden bridge making everybody to take to the skies dodging pillars and monsters.  With an ever-changing track layout, it makes repeating the same track a lot more exciting than other racing games.As with most kart racers, items are a part of the action.  While these weapons make the racing more interesting, they tend to make things unfair.  This is something that this game fixes.  One of these is a weapon that locks onto a racer and seeks it until it makes contact.  In most games, once somebody launches this weapon, all you can do is take the hit.  In here, when the game warns you, it is possible to dodge it with a well-timed boost.  Additionally, another item will allow you go grab them weapon and, if desired, send it back to them.  One more detail about them items is how they are against the leader.  In these games, there is usually a weapon designed to attack specifically the leader.  What makes them bad is that because they are guaranteed to hit the leader regardless of their distance.  This makes it that the game will penalized the leader simply for being in the lead.  Transformed realized this is unfair and fixes it.  With this game, to attack the leader, the weapon used is a swarm of bees.  While they will hurt the leader if they hit, that is not a guarantee.  They work by acting as a series of pillars.  Through skillful driving, it is possible to drive around them unharmed.  By making it that lead targeting item works on skill instead of blind targeting, this makes that if the leader can avoid them, then that person deserves to be in the lead, the way that it should be.Another thing that makes the game stand out are the modes available.  Like any racing them, Grand Prix racing is the main draw of the game.  However, another mode stands out in this game.  In World Tour mode, the game gives various challenges besides simply winning a race.  One on track, dozens of cars will crowd the track making it hard to maneuver.  On another, a tank will try to blast you.  On yet another, the player need to fly through rings that send them both on and off the regular course.  With so much variety, this could have been a game onto itself.  With all the extra challenges, most other racing games pale in comparison.Even though the newest Mario Kart game is about a year newer, this is what it should have been.  Even for those that play on Nintendo systems, this is the superior kart racer to play.  Since this is a multiplatform game, fans of the genre should not miss on one of the best games released in years.			"

												I have never been a fan of any type of racing game, but Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has kept me playing somehow! Commonly referred to as ""Sonic Kart"", Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed carries on the mantle of SEGA's racing franchises, coming after titles such as Outrun and Daytona USA. It features a lot of the characters and locales from alot of SEGA's major and not-so-major franchises (I'm looking at you, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg!).""What does the Transformed in the title mean?"", you might be wondering. To put it simply, each racer's car can transform between a car, boat, and a plane! This makes for some interesting track designs, as portions of each track are land, water, and air-based, and transition between each other very smoothly. It's exciting watching your car morph into a boat or plane without losing any momentum! Sadly, the water segments are the weakest points, as you do not have the traction of the track, and waves don't seem to have any impact on your boat at all. The plane is easily the most fun segment, with the car segments coming second. A major mechanic in the game is ""Drifting"", in which you brake and turn to the side around curves, which after awhile will earn you a boost when you come out of drifting. Using this to your advantage is key to keeping up with your opponents and winning races!With over 20 tracks (40 if you count the mirrored tracks), there is never a dull moment. Tracks also morph and terraform between laps, offering a different experience per lap, and chaning up the land/air/water segments as you go. Tracks range from your typical Sonic locales (Casino Palace, Seaside), to a Panzer Dragoon track, Super Monkey Ball, and Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg. Each track is unique, and they all change as the race progresses.There are many, many characters available to unlock, all representing the franchise they come from. Of course, you have your obvious characters...Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Tails, and Metal Sonic. But there are also characters such as Wreck-It-Ralph, Beat from Jet Set Radio, MiMi from Super Monkey Ball, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Ulala from Space Channel 5, and many more. Exclusive to the Steam version are also the Tactician from Football Manager, the Deadly Assassin from Total War: Shogun, and Heavy/Spy/Pyro from Team Fortress 2. Each one levels up, gaining more ""car mods"" with which you can customize the performance of your vehicle. Your car has a few stats on which it is graded, which can be adjusted with your unlocked mods: Speed, Handling, Acceleration, Boost, and All-Star. All-Star is a special ability unique to each character that can be activated by collecting the appropriate power-up. For example, Knuckles' All-Star ability allows him to use the Master Emerald to conjure a Chaos Blast-like explosion.There are a number of power-ups that can be used, each obtained from a Random Item pickup. Once picked up, a very fast roulette will determine what power-up you receive. This is completely random, and is also the only way to get the All-Star power-up. Examples of some power-ups are Snow (allows you to throw up to 3 snowballs at opponents), Boost (gives you a free, trigger-at-will boost), Fireworks (similar to Snow, but fires a Firework that bounces between walls), and Blowfish (drops a blowfish on the track which stops any racers who hits it momentarily). If you hit an opponent with a power-up like Snow or Firework, they will drop a Coin. These are collected and used to play a slots game before each race, at the cost of 5 Coins per pull. You can obtain a random power-up at the very start of the race in this manner.There are several games modes, including World Tour, Time Trial, Single Race, and Grand Prix. In addition to this, there is a multiplayer that utilizes Steam Matchmaking, so your are never too far from competition!As I said at the beginning of this review, I am not a fan of racing games. But Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed has made me change my mind about racers. They can be pretty awesome when done right, and this game definitely does it right. It's fun, vibrant, and never short on thrills, challenges, or variety. Do check this game out if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.

												Having played several Mario Kart games, I must admit that I enjoy the variety offered by this Sega alternative.  Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed offers customizable vehicles, three different vehicle modes for different terrains, and a large variety of racing modes.  The solo campaign features the expected World Tour, Grand Prix, and Time Attack modes.  Grand Prix and Time Attack are no different than a Mario Kart game, but World Tour has much variety. (Note, the last Mario Kart I played was Mario Kart Wii, so it is possible Mario Kart has since started offering this variety as well.)All-Star Racing Transformed offers several different types of game modes in the World Tour campaign:* Standard Race - 3 laps, use weapons to attack other racers* Battle Race - at most 3 laps, use weapons to attack other racers, 3 hits eliminates a racer* Boost Race - 3 laps, no weapons, lots of boost pads* Boost Challenge - Race through a number of checkpoints before time runs out, time only counts down when you are NOT boosting* Ring Challenge - Fly through a ring course before time runs out* Traffic Attack - dodge through cars to reach checkpoints before time runs out* Drift Challenge - drift through checkpoints along a set path, time only increases when you drift correctly* Versus - 1v1 race, stay in the lead for a set amount of time or get far enough ahead to eliminate the opponent* Sprint - solo race, beat the lap time of a ghost* Pursuit - attack a massive tank that stays in front of you, dodge the tank's attacks, kill it before it kills youMultiplayer retains only the Race, Battle Race, and Boost Race game modes, but it also offers two additional modes exclusive to multiplayer games:* Battle Arena - drive around on a small open map using weapons to attack opponents, 3 hits eliminates a player* Capture the Chao - pick up a Chao creature and bring it to a dropoff area to score, attacking the player with the Chao will cause the Chao to drop and another player can pick it upLiving up to the title, race cars will transform on different levels to account for changes in the course.  Levels feature a mixture of land, sea, and air racing, so you may find yourself driving a car, boat, or plane as you race to the finish.  If cars transforming wasn't enough, the race tracks will also change between laps, so you may find yourself flying in lap 3 even though you used a boat in laps 1 and 2.In addition to the transformations, each driver also has several mods you can apply to the vehicle.  Mods are unlocked by leveling up a driver.  Drivers earn experience for each event they complete regardless of whether or not you win or lose, though you do get much more experience for winning.  The mods may affect each driver's vehicle differently, but in general they take a point away from one category and add it to a different category.  The mods are:* Standard - default stats* Balanced - usually takes a point off the highest stat and gives it to the lowest stat* Handling - takes a point off Speed and adds it to Handling* Acceleration - takes a point off Boost and adds it to Acceleration* Speed - takes a point off Handling and adds it to Speed* Boost - takes a point off Acceleration and adds it to Boost* Console Mod - generally maxes out Speed and/or Boost at the expense of other stats (this mod must be unlocked in the World Tour campaign rather than by leveling up)But how does the game actually play? Is it fun?Short answer: YES!Long answer:It will take you a bit of time to get used to this game.  There are several tricks you'll need to learn to help you race faster, such as knowing how to get the starting boost and when to perform aerial acrobatics, but you will quickly get the hang of things.  The car is by far the easiest vehicle mode to control.  The boat and plane take a bit of getting used to, but none are terribly frustrating after a bit of practice.  There are also plenty of characters with different stats, so you'll certainly be able to find something that suits your play style.  (In fact, there's more than enough characters, many of which you will likely never use.)I enjoyed playing my way through the campaign.  The difficulty curve increased at about the same rate as my skill, so the levels got harder as I got better.  There were a handful of tracks I had to play several times, but for the most part I was able to complete each level in 4 tries or less.Multiplayer is where this game really shines, assuming you have friends to play with.  The game supports 4 player local play and up to 10 players online, which can be a mix of local and network.  The silliness and chaos of casual races with friends is great, but there is also a small competitive community if you're into that instead.One point of complaint is that the game artificially increases the game time by trapping you in non-skippable menus after each race.  It takes 35 seconds to restart a level after you fail, 55 if you want to change characters or difficulty.  You will certainly be button mashing that :XBA: button to get through these screens as fast as possible, but this still amounts to over an hour of your life wasted in menus if you play through the campaign.Another point of complaint is that the ability to fully customize races is missing.  I'd like the ability to specify which weapons are available, or change the rules of the race.  Maybe put on low gravity, faster cars, or some other crazy mix of custom rules.My Game Completion info:I beat all World Tour levels on Hard difficulty.  This unlocked a 6th cup and Expert mode.  I then beat all the levels in the 6th cup on Hard except the last level (which requires you to beat the entire game on Expert in order to unlock. No thanks!  I've had enough of this game artificially increasing game time.)I also beat the first 5 Grand Prix cups on Hard difficulty.  This unlocks another 5 Grand Prix cups in mirror mode (which I ignored).

												Whether navigating the labyrinthine hallways of Curien’s Mansion or dodging the reptilian occupants of Death Adder’s Lair, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the right kind of trip down memory lane. A superior Mario Kart clone and certainly the best Sega has ever produced, especially in terms of the teary-eyed nostalgia inspired by its endless retro cameos.Amazingly beautiful tracks where you race, swim and fly, sometimes changing the level as you progress through it, are what makes this game great.Nostalgia aside, Sonic Transformed as a kart racing game is a blast to play and it comes highly recommended, especially at the reasonable Steam price.

												Admittedly, an oddball in my Steam game library, one filled with gory shooters, slaughterfests, and other such M-rated material, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is like the stray hippie amongst a population consisting of shizophrenic sociopaths! If you don't like long reviews, just skip to the last paragraph, where I summarize everything!I quite honestly don't remember just how exactly this game ended up in my library, but I recently decided to play it anyway.  Because while I may have many games I still need to play out of my library, I've been desiring a decent racing game for quite some time. Did I expect this game to actually fulfill that desire by being anything close to what could be considered a quality racing game that brought me some great amount of entertainment? Honestly, no, I did not.But alas, I was surprised! What I expected to be nothing more than a dumbed down racing experience with unbalanced items and cheesy banter between characters that would make me want to turn this into one of those M-rated shooters I own so that I may claim unsavory vengeance upon them for their horrible forced personalities, turned out to actually be one of the few good racing games I've seen on Steam!How is it good? Well, allow me to explain! Wait... Oh, right, that's what reviews are about... Um... Moving on!From the screenshots, and the involvement of Sonic and co, in a bright and cheerful-looking environment, one may be brought to the understandable conclusion that this game would only be enjoyable if you were young, or the stereotypical ""hardcore"" 50-year old Sonic Fan with no friends, who yells ""You're too slow!"" at every car he drives by on his way to his minimum wage job at the local McDonald's. You would be wrong.Amazingly enough, this game is actually enjoyable regardless of age, and you really don't have to be a fan of Sonic at all to enjoy the gameplay. I'd recommend this game regardless of the age of the player, as it's obviously safe for young kids to play, but definitely offers an enjoyable experience for older players as well (For reference, I'm almost 19).Is it for the ""filthy casuals""? No, not at all! While a casual could definitely get into the game on the lower difficulties that take nearly no skill whatsoever, a pro gamer could easily find a good challenge on the hard, and expert difficulties!My only complaint would be how few tracks there are. A total of 16 new tracks, with an additional 4 classic tracks, plus mirrored versions of all the tracks, and +1 new track with a mirrored version if you get the DLC. Thankfully, the game offers a variety of modes to make this small number of tracks less bothersome. Nonetheless, it is a small amount, and new DLCs with additional tracks are unlikely.Speaking of the DLC, it's not bad, but I certainly wish it offered more than just one single new track. A full circuit of four new tracks would certainly be more appealing. The DLC track isn't really worth it in all honesty, since it's not nearly as interesting as the tracks originally in the game, and there's also a few bugs in it that can be accidentally triggered from time to time (nothing too frequent, so don't worry). Buy it if you really want a new character, and desperately want an extra track. Otherwise, skip it.So, in summary, a great game for all ages (children or adults), and offers a challenge for both casuals and hardcore gamers, providing a small number of tracks, but a fair number of characters, and overall one of the few good racing games on Steam right now.

												Review, Tips, GuideWhere do I start with how awesome and addictive this game is? Somehow I managed to clock in over 620 hours playing this, still crave every second of it!Being a late starter and only getting the game at the start of 2014 when a friend was kind enough to give it to me as a gift while trying to promote Ryo Hazuki DLC and Shenmue.I did not have high expectations for the game after playing the horrible touch screen version you can download on mobile... this dampened my expectations as to what to expect on the PC and console addition of SSASRT.First mode I tried was the online match-making. Never in my life have I felt like such a novice at a kart racing game, there really is a polarising effect between being good and being down right elitist when it comes to online MM. This did not stop me from playing. I was fascinated, intrigued of how these top players became so awesome at this kart racer and quickly learnt that SSASRT is a rather technical Kart racing game.Those new to the SSASRT: you need to learn fundamental basics.Learn how to drift to level 3Find out how to risk boost and danger boostLearn the tracks as best as you canLearn how to stack your boostsLearn every item and use them effectivelyLearn how to avoid drones with a driftUnlock practice with all characters find their strengths and weaknessesCheck your mini-map on straight ways for approaching racers and on incoming item spam, back spam if needed to counter this and look backward to see the potential racer.Constantly if ever in bad situation go all-star strategy.Above all else do not hit walls and practice and maintain high speed and keep consistent racesWondering how I got so good at this game: I came up with a plan!Decided to complete career mode and gain all (232 stars) and complete all Grand Prix and mirror tracks set out to unlock all characters and their respective console mods. I thought this would give me the edge I needed but I was in for a surprise... Gaining all the all-stars in career mod was tougher than expected but at the same time it was the most rewarding. And whatever you gained in career mode without knowing ...you will be applying in online MM.Sumo Digital have gone to a lot of effort at getting the balance between casually playing this Kart Racer and challenging the player to get better while also gaining rewards after completing and getting all 232 stars. And gaining a new character ""Ages"" was funny enough (this spells Sega backwards).I was feeling confident with my new attained super kart racing skills after completing the game, getting all 232 stars and completing Grand Prix on expert mode; I was sure I was in with a chance to take on even the top players on MM, come out on top or at least give them a good run for their money. I found myself accelerating up the ranks and obtaining & keeping a constant and respectful 1600 rank in MM. I new it was time to take on higher ranked players and test my skills.. Again I was in for surprise, feeling frustrated with my efforts and felt I had peaked only obtaining 1600 to 1700 ranks while I greatly desired to achieve a 2000 rank.To do this I had to better my playing style to compete with higher ranks. I pushed on and came up with another plan, which was only something you could gain through experience and patience and allot of hours playing. I set out to learn all the yellow pick-up locations, what they had to offer and tap into their potential and also learned which mods and characters worked best for each track.On some tracks this was a huge game changer: for example there are two yellow pick-ups on Graffiti City: the first pick-up is a triple boost; used at the right time you can gain tremendous speed on straight runs, however this is not always enough to win this track consistently due to the tight nature of the course and the ""bees"" on the second lap. Now, this is where the second yellow pick-up comes in handy, which is a (blue glove). I like to use this when the ""Bees"" come my/your way... activate it and sail through them, the bees also act like a wall and are slowing down other racers who might be fast approaching.This strategy gave me huge advantage over players, and from time to time I have been accused of cheating on Grafity City. Well, once you get to grips with the course it's possible to pick both yellow pick-ups and use the triple boost and pick-up the blue glove which will both give your even more distance, when timed and use correctly. Sometimes you might find yourself in challenging situations with regular players who see you as their rival, and you might end up getting a few friend requests.:)) This is something not many articles mention or people talk about...It  is the online social communtiy linked with that game which I think people really need to start taking notes of because I think this is also a factor that makes this game a great success...it is the community that goes with it..SSASRT has an active racing community and friendly too, and sometimes it causes and creates rivalries in MM, especially with the Brazil players and Europeans.One veteran SSASRT racer who goes by the alias of ""harlot"" decided to add me as a friend back in july, he was quick to message me about my skills limitations at that time and style... others have taken note of my potential and this gave me more confidence to keep on going and to continue racing SSASRT. I can't remember exactly what was said back then, but we soon became good rivals to one another, we both had a common goal to improve our racing style and to win as much as we can. But we had different ways of going about it. harlot said to me: If I want to really improve my game I need to ""time attack"", I took note of what he said and I managed to unlock all the secrets the tracks had to offer, if it wasn't for harlot's insight. It would be almost impossible for me to keep up with the elitist at MM....there is so much to learn to be at the top of your game while playing SSASRT...The game has unlimited potential in that regard!HARLOT QUOTE: I can, at this moment, be a better matchmaker in a week, than you can be a time attacker in the same amount of timeEven though I had the Time Attack experience it did not always solve crucial problems and differences between MM and TA, that is because in MM you can pick up items and if you get hit it it slows you down… because TA promotes the use of ""Console Mods"", but at times this is not always suitable for MM and so, I decided to approach this differently.This is what I come up with to address this issue:I have a character for every track in the game, I developed a strategy that will give me the overall edge to that particular track and the best balance depending on some factors, that I take into account.I am very specific about this, learned over time certain methods and race conditions that need a particular fine tuning, which can greatly improve your chances. This is where the true sophistication that SSASRT brings.These are a few examples what character's I use for some of the tracks in SSASRT and the mod's I use and the yellow items I like to pick-up.Race of Ages - Ryo Hazuki - Console mod - Provides the perfect balance of movement speed - especially in water areas and being small enough to avoid going over the edge of the track.Game changer: Triple Boost yellow pick-up second lap just passed the finish line. Chilly Castle - AIAI - Sonic - Manager - (Ryo Hazuki/ Console mod) - best over all mod for this track ""Acceleration"".Game Changer: You will need to know this course inside and out, learn TA acceleration mod and track knowledge and above all maintaining lead will see you beat this track on MM.Dream valley - Ages / Ryo Hazuki / Gilleus / - Console modGame Changer: Learn how to (Risk-boost) on practically anything and stack your boosts as best you can.

												This is the best Mario Kart clone currently on the market, but it does have some positive points over even Mario Kart...- The tracks are so varied, with some really good tracks included.- Content, the game has so many characters to unlock, kart mods, tracks, & a long campaign that get's pretty tricky near the end.- The campaign is 2 player.- The AI doesn't cheat, if you're spanking them, you're spanking them. They don't magically get the equivilant to 3 blue shells in a row & take you out on the last 2 corners, despite dominating the entire race.- The difficulty is fair & has a nice upward slope, meaning you get better at the game as it gets harder, nothing ever seems too hard, unless you jump straight in for the 3 star missions despite never playing before.- The music and graphics may not stand out as much as Mario Kart, but they do stand on their own merits.It's not all positive though, the game does have some bad points;- Character selection, quite a few are pretty bland & won't be used unless you're aiming for 100%. I mean I love the Football Manager series, but I have no interest in driving as some generic manager just because SEGA publish the franchise.- Shadow's in it.- Some of the 3 star missions will do your head in, but again, this isn't the game being unfair, it just means you're not driving well enough.- A few of the tracks are forgetable.8/10Best kart racer on Steam, if you need a Mario Kart-esque racer in your library, this is by far the best choice.

												This is my favorite racing game on Steam. Its similar to new versions of Mario Kart, but I like the feel of this better. It has the typical things like character selection, map selection, power ups, and turbo speed strips to drive over. It includes land, water, and air racing. Some of the maps have all three in one race. The acheivements are fun to get, and some are actually pretty challenging. I like the feel of this one much more than the first. I definitely recommend using a controller for this game, as it makes it much easier. It has online play too, so its fun to race friends. Drifting is a very important thing in this game, so if you're losing a lot, try to drift more around turns. I recommend this to to anyone whos looking for a racing game, a casual game to just play a little bit of once in a while,  something to play with friends, or a fan of Mario Kart or CTR Crash Team Racing.

												This game is quite impressive and original.Other than Mario Kart, it's been more than 15 years that I haven't seen such game being fun and competitive at the same time.The graphics are good, the different maps will give you some nostalgic feelings, every transformation is smooth to drive with.The online multiplayer is a little laggy and in some maps, there isn't really a technique of driving you can use to win, it all depends of the items and that's quite bad. However, the local multiplayer up to 4 players is really fun, no lag and team with your friends to be on the podium.Also, the game itself is quite easy, there's 4 different levels (Easy to Expert) and you can end them without any problem. The ghost times will maybe give you some challenge, unless you unlocked the last car and fully upgraded it.- Finally, it's an awesome game, really enjoyable in solo. Buy it now!			"

												This game is very similar to Crash Team Racing and Muppet RaceMania from PlayStation (I only played those two). Concept is same - you race with other characters, using powerups to help you on the way. There's no pure racing, you have to learn to drift properly and do stunts while in air to earn short speed boosts and also trying to sabotage other players, which is not always easy to do but can help greatly in determining the winner. There're plenty of tracks and several racing mods so it's hard to get boring.Although you can finish this game in any difficulty you want, playing on highest difficulty is a real treat. There's pure adrenaline rush, trying to finish first without making errors (especially in ""beat the ghost"" mod). Multiplayer is still active (as of this date), you won't have problems finding others to play with. Some achievements are really hard to get so this is not easy 100%.Overall, great racing experience, great game, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Rating 9.5/10Overview: Arcade kart RacerThe Good:+ 20 levels that span across different parts of the Sega universe. All the levels are detailed, well designed and incredibly fun to play. What really makes the levels is that they feel so alive, whether its air ships battling in the skies, pieces of the track blowing up, carriers jets flying over head, or flying through exotic envirnoments it all adds to the atmoshpere. + The majority of the levels change inbetween laps keeping things unique and interesting. There are three modes of racing: car, boat and plane.  One lap you may be driving a car and the next lap you may be flying a plane, sometimes you switch between the modes in a single lap. +Plenty of characters each with their own stats. As you play with a certain racer you unlock mods that change their stats for better performance depending on the level/mode your playing. + The game features plenty of different modes across 4 difficulty levels. Each mode is fun to play and very creative. Some modes include racing, boost challenges, sprint, battle areans, traffic attack etc. The Average- I found the weapons you use to be somewhat average. I did not find them as unique or interesting as the levels. - Multiplayer is somewhat still alive but its pretty hard to get a good game going. ConclusionThis is one of the best arcade racers on Steam, if you can get some friends together you are sure to have a good time. They took everything that was great in the first game and improved upon it in significant way "

YouTube™ Video: Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed - Just 15 Minutes 

			Views: 370		

			Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a kart racing video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. It was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in November 2012, for...		

Long time ago, Nintendo create their best Kart Race called Mario Kart. Althought the game shows aged the gameplay still now a days totally fantastic, and using that ""secret"" formula, Nintendo created more and more games of their sucessful franchise.But if you LOVE Mario Kart, like me, and don't have a Nintendo plataform, well, you certainlly was abandoned. Well, less so far, Sega copied that ""secret formula"" and I could said: Improved that formula... a lot!Think about a game made with respect,""love"" and care... Yes! Sega did it! And put all your legacy inside this game (almost all) like Sonic series, Golden axe, Samba de Amigo, Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, Afterburn, Skies of Arcadia, Crazy Taxi and much more... Pure nostalgic! The ""transformed mechanics"" add more variety. (Your machine tranformes to an Airplane, or a ship depending of the situation)Highlights:- Perfect Gameplay- feeling of speed- Itens are balanced and help you (and cause trouble too!) your controller skill are more important.- Diversty of game modes, tracks, chracters.- Graphically Awesome (and you don't need a powerful PC!)- Nostalgic music and places- 4 splitscreen gameplay and online modes.Really, this game have only Highlights. Play it and have fun!			"

												Why would I not recommend this game?The gameplay is vastly different from the previous entry in the series. Transforming and drift boosting will give a great edge in this game once you master the latter. Risk boosting in plane mode can take some time to master since you have to roll out of the way at the last moment for it to count.The staff ghosts can be a real pain in some levels (looking at Graveyard Gig and Burning Rangers in particular since both are a little difficult to master drifting in).Cameo appearances from non-SEGA stuff (Danica Patrick, Ralph, and Yogscast if you choose to buy it) are nice to see. Interestingly, people seem to hold a lot of course record top 10 spots with Ralph with characters like Metal Sonic, Sonic, and AGES all coming pretty close to it.Quite a blast to race through the courses (although I think Mirror Mode could have been replaced with 4-8 new tracks instead, oh well, SUMO's call there) and try to beat your own record every time. I did find Traffic Attack (sans the last one) and Pursuit to be a difficult to master since those felt a tad bit more on the ""need to memorize a specific course of pattern"" kind of logic to me. Pursuit was way more difficult though since you have a set amount of HP so you can't just recklessly chase down the tank.The characters were great although a couple of them looked a bit off (looking at Gum, Beat, and Pudding). Dialogue and racing stuff was pretty nice. It seems Gillius is the hardest one to master as well out of all the characters.Fantastic game, whether it is in a deal on Steam or not, worth icking up and playing.			"

Mario Kart looks kinda ridicilous after playing this game. However, as always playing in S Class [Expert Class], you'll have to confront to a very overpowered AI and sometimes you'll be dominating, and suddenly you see a random racer like Alex Kidd that drives at like 200% of his car performance. You will then lose the race and you will start insulting OP drivers about how their character conception annoys you like : ""Alex Kiddo, u lil' piece of trash!

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the Mario Kart version for the PC. Or better yet, the old Diddy Kong Racing.Run in a different environments and with different vehicles (car, plane and boat) is very fun and every course and characters brings that old and good feeling to revive the golden hits of the Sega company. It's just to much fun to bring Alex Kidd in the Golden Axe course and the Get Set Radio challenging you for the first place.The race controls are pretty good, it's very similar to other games with this kart style, but in here you must learn how to drift to keep it up to the competition and earn some boost to make your way to the first place or to beat the time.The game modes are very nice, you can play only some races, go for tournaments or go on career mode to earn starts and then unlock more courses and characters.The power ups works the same way we are used to know in this style of game, and they add a good fun element. Some of them you can choose to throw ahead or leave to hit someone behind you.The sound design is great. Every music and sound effect make all the experience in the race unique and brings the memories of those games.The level design is awesome! It gives you the feel of movement and speed that is the heart of a race game and it is always changing! In some courses you will see all the landscape and the road being attacked and as the race goes you will change to other paths or even change completely your vehicle to a plane or boat to continue the race. And this is absolutely fantastic!If you are an orphan of Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing (which is better, sorry to say that...) you MUST try this one. It's a great and extremely fun race game.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a great game. No, I'm not kidding. This is better than a Sonic game deserves to be, hell, it's better than a SEGA game deserves to be. This is actually a real competitor for the Mario Kart franchise, and it's one of the better racing games you'll find on Steam. It's also probably the closest thing we'll ever get to having Mario Kart on Steam.Okay, so let's get it out of the way first because it's been said to death, and it's true: this game is basically a Mario Kart clone. It's very easy to see how the older game was translated into this. Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed doesn't score high marks on originality. For instance, a lot of the pickups are basically just reskinned versions of the ones we know and love. Instead of green shells, there are snowballs. Instead of the red shell, there is an RC car. Instead of the mushroom, there are boosts. Instead of the mine, there's is a blowfish. Instead of the golden mushroom, there's the hot rod. Instead of the invincibility star, there's the ""All Star"" pickup. The racing gameplay is also based entirely around drifting. On top of that, there is the battle mode akin to the Mario Kart style. As said before, this game doesn't do much in the way of uniqueness, but it's the way everything coheres that makes it stand out.Okay, so let's talk about how this game isn't like Mario Kart. There are three important gameplay factors here: the first is that the game is based on three different kinds of vehicle types: car, boat, and plane. This creates quite a bit of variety in the playstyle and level layout, which tends to change from lap to lap. The other thing is that while yes, drifting between yellow, red, and blue sparks was a thing in Mario Kart, here the boosting is much more prevalent (a third-tier boost gives you much more boost than it would in Kart) and the pre-boost drifting seems to lower your speed more than in Kart, making it slightly more of a risk. The third aspect is that you now gain experience points for each character, unlocking different ""mods"" that alter various stats for the players. You start out with 16 or 18 already unlocked, and you can unlock another 10 or 12. Each character only uses his or her own cart but can unlock five or six mods, granting you about 180 different loadouts, possibly more.There are a few other things that this does differently than does Kart. For instance, the ground will frequently give you opportunities to do stunts, the correct implementation of which will give you boosts, which are essential to winning on the higher difficulties. There are also unique pickups: there's the rocket, which fires straight ahead and is essentially like a very hard green shell to aim. There's the glove, which lets you pick up any item thrown at you and lets you take it for yourself. There's the twister, which can spin an enemy around. And there's also the notorious SWARM OF BEES, which is the most random of the bunch, putting bees in the field. Mario Kart fans may be pleased or displeased to hear that there is no real equivalent of the blue shell in this game.Before talking about multiplayer, I do want to mention the single-player. Single-player is way more fun than it deserves to be. The career mode has multiple parts, including world tour and grand prix. World Tour seems like the main single-player ""campaign,"" and is intuitive, easy to understand, and has a lot of cool game modes, some of which unfortunately didn't make it into the multiplayer. Game modes such as Traffic Attack, where you have to avoid cars and go through certain zones to get time added to the clock, and Pursuit, where you collect ammo pickups to destroy a tank that's firing at you, are just great fun and add a new element that had been lacking in Kart since the beginning.Now, on to the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very fun. You can choose between five different kinds of racing styles: standard racing on four different difficulties, battle race (where each player has three lives and you try to kill the other players during a race), arena battle, capture the chao (which I admittedly hate), and boost race (which I admittedly love). It is unfortunately a bit clunky and time-consuming to get everything set up, as I will explain below. Thankfully they've mitigated some of the loading time with giving you a slot machine mini-game while the map is loading, which require five coins that you can only pick up on racing courses, which may yield a bonus. You can use any of the characters that you've unlocked plus any of their mods. You will also still receive EXP as usual. I should also mention that you can split-screen the game at any time. I've never tried this, but the game encourages this at every turn, so I guess if you're a split-screen fan, this is a game to consider. I should also comment on the look and feel of the maps. The maps are extremely well-detailed, bright, colorful, smooth, and pretty. The bright maps feel very nice and the dark maps don't feel drab or dreary, as appears to be the current trend that blights modern video games. The maps themselves are inspired by various SEGA games, like Super Monkey Ball or Space Channel 5, but none include actual map layouts from said games. The feel of the cars is pretty solid. The characters are sometimes a bit random but come from a variety of different classic games. For instance, there's a character named Pudding; do you know where a SEGA character named Pudding comes from? As you can imagine, there are more Sonic characters than any others, but you're never required to play as a Sonic character. Of course, I wish there would be more characters from random games (like Billy Hatcher, for instance, how cool would that be?), and this is one of those games that lets your imagination run wild with ideas. Of course, there are a few negatives. Probably the biggest is the first-time setup is a bit of a hassle. It sucks that you need to launch the game separately in Config mode and I've also heard that some people can only get it to open in compatibility mode. On top of that, it seems that they never fixed the sound. You need to turn the volume way down if you want to talk to people, but at the main title, the sound will revert back to its normal volume, which is all the way up. The game does hardly anything to explain to you how to use any of the controls, including drifting and what the items do. I get that this encourages trial and error but there are entire main facets that are crucial to winning that are unexplained by the game. Lastly, setting up matches in the multiplayer is a real pain. You have to re-select your character each time you want to do a new race, and if you're the host, changing the map takes you through a lot of unnecessary menus. It should have been a lot quicker. I should also mention that while you can play this with a mouse and keyboard, I find that the controls are entirely unfeasible. The only way I can play this is with a controller, perhaps that's just me.All in all, this is a comparable game to the classic Mario Kart (I guess it would compare to 8, but it's much, MUCH better than 8 in my opinion). It feels like a game that was made by a company that actually cares, not SEGA. Highly recommended.			"

												Simply put.. the best cart racer yet. Beating Mario Kart, Crash Team Racing and any other cart racers that have gone before it.The fact that it's Multiplatform and includes Online Multiplayer this time (The original Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing on PC did not have Online Multiplayer) means this title is going to be tough to beat.Sporting more challenging AI and far more variety with both tracks and racers, along with the Transformation mentioned in the game's title, this is a serious cart racer for those looking for something with more depth, challenge and all-round badassery.Not one to miss.

												I've seen this game for some time now and didn't really think much of it.  Finally, at it's super-low sale price I decided to give it a go.  I was a HUGE fan of ""Mario Kart"" - both for the Super Nintendo and for N64.  So this game had a little bit to live up to...HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥WAS I SURPISED.This game doesn't have anything to do with Sonic (aside from including him and the cast as characters...among cooler characters), it's just a balls-to-the-wall  come-get-some cart racer.  I don't think I've ever played a cart racer that felt so damned... HARDCORE.  The characters are all varyed but fairly balanced, the maps get absolutely insane, ranging from peaceful mario-kartish maps to nightmares from hell and beyond worst than anything the Rainbow Road could dream up.  And you get to enjoy all of these things not just from a Driver's Seat, but from a Cockpit and from a Captain's chair as well!The game is hard.  Even playing alone in world tour mode on ""Easy"" presents some challenge.  And it'll take you a good bit of practice to beat those same races on ""Normal"".  Step into multiplayer?  You better be prepared for a stomping, because those kids don't mess around.I give this game a solid 8/10.  It would be a 10/10, but the marketing department loses 2 points for not letting me know I should have been playing this sooner.BUY THIS GAME NOW.  Is it full price?  Then buy it.  Is it on sale?  Then buy a few extra copies for some friends of yours.  You won't regret it. "

This title has a insane amount of learn and curve, if you want a fun online experience you will need to jump some hefty hurtals, this game will make you rage at times.

												In my opinion Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is one & only competition for Mario Kart. The amount of fun that this game gave me cannot be measured. The game is super cute, colorful and entertaining. Single player content is enjoyable, but it's the multiplayer option that keeps you sucked in, which is not surprising.The characters are lovely, graphics is beautiful and music is also pleasantly blending in. If you are looking for something which could give you the Mario Kart experience, Sonic is for you. It is truly well made.			"

Sonic & All-Stars Racing TransformedDeveloped by: Sumo DigitalPublished by: SEGAReleased: Nov 2012 (Consoles), Jan 2013 (Steam), Jan 2014 (IOS & Android), Oct 2016 (Backwards compat. for Xbox One)In short:Without a contest the finest Kart racing game released on PC.  Excellent port from the console versions, runs great, plays great with both keys or a controller.  Large selection of tracks themed around classic Sega games, full of alternate routes and 'interactive' track changes, all featuring sections where your vehicles transform into either flying machines or speed boats.  Plenty of single player content, very challenging on higher difficulties, but of course where the game shines is in multiplayer.  Supports local co-op up to four players, and also lets you play local co-op in online multiplayer.  Excellent net code, I've never noticed typical lag in friend or public lobbies.If you plan to go it alone be warned though, while there is an online playerbase still for the game it is pretty small.  Still , well worth having in your Steam library for those rare cases of couch co-op opportunities, or if you can round up some online friends for races.			"

												Bias: I am a dino. Gotta go Fast!One of my favorite racing games (besides Mario Kart). I am not the best at racing, however, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and even held a few tournaments for some friends in different groups I am in. It took some time, but I was able to unlock all the racers and tracks to allow for variability. I am still not the best at slides but I have fun competing anyway.If you enjoy cartoony / mario kart esque racing games, this is a game for you.To be honest, I have no complaints. Maybe hope for more characters or tracks for this great title, but that was the only thing10/10 on a Dino Scale. I must play game if you have friends who you like to compete with.			"

												Probably the best kart racer not called ""Mario Kart"". Depending on what day you ask me, I might even say its better than Mario Kart. Sumo Digital really ""gets"" Sega fanservice in a way that even Sega themselves do not. This game is, flat out, a love letter to Sega fans. All of the obvious references are hit, but expect to see plenty of Sega obscura get shoutouts. The artificial intelligence is really smart, too; don't expect Mario Kart's passive A.I., the CPU racers in this game want blood and will go out of their way to deny you important pickups. But, as long as you keep out of their line of sight and drift accordingly, things won't go too poorly. Legitimate driving skills will take you far in this game.The tracks are creative and varied, the game controls well, and the visuals are gorgeous. Like Mario Kart but don't own any Nintendo platforms? This is for you.			"

												Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is exactly what it says on the box. Racing transformed for a modern era, while still having that classic feel making this a must own.For those of you feeling like Mario Kart has gotten a bit stale due to lack of innovation, this game may be more your style. This game is just teeming with love, with classic games bursting with modern visuals and sounds. Every part of this game just feels like a love letter to SEGA fans.GraphicsModernized graphics for classic SEGA games such as Burning Rangers and Panzer Dragoon. The visuals in this game are stunning when you play on the highest settings, and even with a modest computer you'll still get 60+FPS making this game feel amazingly fast and fluid. All the characters are well modeled and textured, and the levels are teeming with beautiful colors and lighting. Each level has been lovingly crafted from older SEGA titles and re-imagined in ways that will bring a tear to long-time fans.SoundThe music in the game mostly consists of remixed themes from older games in a mostly drum'n bass genre, with the odd dubstep-ish song thrown in here and there. But don't let that fool you, the dubstep is done in moderation and actually sounds good, even to someone who doesn't really like that genre. Each song feels fast-paced and full of action to make the gameplay that much more satisfying.GameplayNow on the the most important part, gameplay. As you may have guessed, there are 3 modes of driving, air, water, and land. Land plays exactly as you think it would, very much like Mario kart, but a bit faster and the cars feel heavier. Boating/water travel feels like slippery land travel, and is the hardest to steer on because of it. This is mostly noted in the Burning Rangers level, which is mostly boating with sharp turns in which you tend to go bumping a lot. Air travel is, well, air travel. You can still drift in the air, but you have to worry about your X axis as well, which tends to make it more difficult. You can also do stunts in the air as any vehicle, which will give you a boost if done correctly. Of course if you crash mid-stunt you're gonna go slower.The items/weapons in the game are well thought out and even if you get smashed by every single weapon, if you're a good enough player you can still get first place. No blue shells here. Although you may want to watch out for the bees.Value for the costAt $30 you will get way more than your money's worth. Tons of missions and unlockables, GPs to go through, stickers to unlock for doing certain things and of course, multiplayer. The multiplayer is really what will keep bringing you back to this. Online works well for the most part, and racing with up to 10 random people or friends is an absolute delight. Voice chat is included as well, and at the time of writing this there is no way to currently turn that off, but there is a patch on the way which will fix it.Final verdictA game well worth the money that will keep you entertained for many a month. If you've ever been a fan of racing or kart racing in general you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to not give this a try.9.5/10			"

												So after the pretty decent but somewhat shallow outing of Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing, Sumo Digital sure caught me off-guard when they announced a sequel to it. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does a good job at improving the flaws and shortcomings the first game had, such as making the courses more varied with at least 1 track based off a different franchise such as Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, NiGHTS, Shinobi, etc. as opposed to just running with 3 or 4 themes for each course, more interesting track design with tougher placements hazards and they even brought in remixes of various SEGA franchise tunes to accomodate the soundtrack.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's main gimmick is having the vehicles and gameplay change constantly during the race, transforming your car  when you pass through large blue rings to either a boat or a plane. Some courses have a interesting mechanic in where usually the 2nd or 3rd lap has you driving through a completely different pathway, forcing you to adapt to these situations and work your way around these. Most racing game veterans will recognize this vehicle-changing gimmick from Mario Kart 7, but it reminds me more of the likes of Diddy Kong Racing from back on the N64, except that the courses are designed specifically for each vehicle mode rather than a wide-open track fitting them all. Also very important is that while you're in the air, flipping and rolling your vehicle is encouraged to build up boosts for when you land, but you have to be careful with this as not landing properly will costs you speed and lose all boost buildup, and there's switch-drifting which helps you maintain your drift boost buildup as you switch from steering left to right and vice-versa.Other new features are the mods that come with each character. Mods are pre-set custom stat adjustments that you can pick from on the character select screen to help you adjust to certain conditions better in the races and in missions in World Tour. (Explained later down below). If you get hit alot or crash into obstacles, acceleration suits your vehicle best and if it has alot of sharp turns, go for handling. Items are more or less kept the same, but given a new skin, such as the boxing glove to the missile, the barrier shield from Sonic to a glove which in addition to blocking either a stage hazard or a enemy projectile now gives you that item to use in return to get revenge on the attacker, if your item slot isn't filled with another item. Most items are balanced enough, but I will list my issues with them when I get to them.World Tour is also a new addition to this game specifically designed to cater to the more mission-based gameplay in where you need to clear races under certain rules or different gameplay methods, such as flying through rings in plane mode, winning consequtively from a set amount of opponents in the same race in a 1-on-1 format. The difficulty you clear these missions on affect the stars you get, which in turn are required to progress further in the World Tour's map and the real reward from doing them: unlocking new characters and special mods. Most of these missions are designed pretty decently, but your skill will be sorely tested on quite a few on them, especially in the unlockable Expert class difficulty.As for my issues with this game:- A few items are very unbalanced and usually can most likely make or break a race for skilled players. A good example of this is the ice weapon. You gain 3 shots of these by default, and while the game tells you that shooting all 3 shots at 1 opponent will freeze and stun them longer than normal, I notice no such difference, and every seperate shot stuns you as much as getting shot by all 3. The game developers tried to implement a way to make it hard for expert players to win races by a miles' lead compared to the other racers with the Sky Tiger item, a item that spawns giant wasps in front of the 1st place lead, but won't hurt the user if he passes by them while they're still active. It sounds fine on paper, but in terms of programming, it leaves alot to be desired. It works only fine on small passageways on car and boat plathways because it almost garantuees the 1st place lead can barely avoid them, but they can't spawn properly if used near a transform ring, and in the plane they are very easy to avoid due the large area's in the plane sections. It's also possible to shoot a wasp and clear yourself a way through them, which I think shouldn't be possible. It can be a decent counter to expert players, but this isn't comparable to the Blue Shell from Mario Kart by a longshot.- The method of unlocking characters in this game is very arbitrary compared to the previous game. If you want to play as your favorite character from the get-go and isn't available right at the start, you're going to spend a incredibly long time mastering the game's courses and mechanics just to be able to unlock them. For expert players this isn't a big deal, but casual players who don't have alot of free time on their hands will be annoyed by this, if they want to play as for example NiGHTS or Joe Musashi, it will take quite some time for them to even unlock them, when in the previous game you could just play a few races, earn points to spend in the shop to unlock them, and there you go.- The physics in a few courses, especially the boat sections in the game are very clunky and will cause the many frustrated losses of players. A good example of this are the boost ramps in the boat sections of Samba Tour and Adder's Lair in where if you approach the ramp from the side and not dead-on straight, your boat will tilt to ridiculous extremes and will lose all momentum and speed trying to readjust itself, or you will be launched way higher in the air than you're supposed to, and lose a good deal of speed as well. And there are also some courses in where some object events that occur in laps will actually hinder the player very drastically if they're not careful and going too fast, such as a robotic fish in the final lap of Ocean View causing the player to bump all over the place if they come in contact with it, spawning when the 1st lead reaches a specific area, and the bridge in Adder's Lair at the end of the 1st lap will not raise fast enough and cause the player to most likely crash into it and lose all speed. These are major issues and I don't understand why the developers couldn't iron out those bugs. -Unlocking the Expert class difficulty in World Tour is very late near the end of the mode itself, and forces you to replay every single mission you cleared before on the Hard difficulty all over again if you want all the stars in the game, which is a really cheap method of artifically extending the mode's gameplay length. Issues aside, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a solid racing game, and I do recommend it for both racing game enthusiasts and fans of SEGA's franchises in general, but beware of the steep learning curve and having to deal with occasional frustrating glitches or lag in the online gameplay.

												had a so much fun playing this game and its better the mario kart in my opinion -first of all the plot, well there is no real plot (sadly) , you just have to select a character ( around 20 + 3 from the dlcs and you can lvl up to get new mods to balance your kart stats and play with you own style) then select  a game modes (there is World Tour, Grand Prix , quick races , arena for multi ).-graphicly it's really beautiful and well detailed for a consol port (on ultra) also well optimized even for a potato pc.-gameplay: easy game mechanics ( arcade racing) with power pickups , each character (from different sega games + bonus characters like TF2 ) has his own different kart with different stats , the levels are inspired for different sega games  but the game is very unbalanced when it comes to difficulty ( easy is too damn easy , medium is like hard , hard is like dark souls hard and very hard is near impossible )-perfect  voice acting ,awesome soundtracks ( remixes of sega games main music)-for the controls ( the bad thing in this games) you need an xbox 360 controllers or use x360ce cause the keyboard is a no go -multiplayer is still live , you will find some people playing quick races.-time to time the game crashes but only when you exit the game so its ok i guess no big deal-achievements works fine but some of them are very challenging  -steam trading cardswell if you're looking for some fun between friends or solo then this game is for you ( no mario kart on pc so its not like you have any choice :p ) better get this one and skip the firt sonic all stars game , worth the money ( better get it on sales  4.99 $)9/10			"

												Sega, you nail'd it...This title could looks like a copy/paste of a classic mario kart racing, BUT IT ISN'T!We all know that the Sonic team likes to do so much meth, but this time they really work hard on this title. Every map is well designed, every character haves his styled veicle and every music fit his game's map. The poring of this game into the PC is not one of the best, but after some minutes of game, you will learn how to drive those frikin' veicle with no problems at all.The original thing that really impress me is the fact that the maps change every lap, they're not static, but interact with everything that is goin on in the background.But there are some problems, and some of those are ridiculous.Some model's eyes... they are staring at me.. REALLY THEY'RE ♥♥♥♥ING SCARY. Did they forget to give them some eyelids?! And the most stupid thing I've ever seen: Sega actually paid some companies for add their characters, and they decide to voice acting them selfing, giving us stuff like a tf2 Pyro who mumbles like he's (she's?) suffering the pains of hell (you see what I did here? No? k.)Last thing that kinda bothered me, was the decision to create extra maps that are actually maps already in-game, but mirrored. They really had to?In the end, this is a great title that I suggest you to get if on a nice sale, you can follow me, I'll set you free, if you trust me I'll make you escape from the track (I have no idea how to end this review).Final score: 7.5/10			"

												Amazing racing game, it features racing on land, water, and air with transforming vehicles. It has over 20 playable characters and over 25 arenas and dynamic tracks playable in a lot of engaging game modes.I really like how they were able to set up the World tour. It has 4 difficulty settings and if you pay attention and observe how the opponents race, you can learn a lot even from easy ones. Aside from the standard race, there are a lot of events such as drift challenge, traffic attack, ring race, sprint, pursuit, battle race, and versus. Each of the events focuses on a game element to help players practice on a specific game mechanic.What is more interesting is that the local game can be played by up to four players (split-screen). If you can have some friends or relatives come over you can play race, battle arena, battle race, capture the chow, or boost race game mode. (Even the world tour can be played by up to four players.)As of writing, I have just started playing events under the Superstar Showdown, I have not yet tried to play online, I'll try finishing everything on hard level before doing so. Overall, I think this is the best kart racing game.			"

												Summary: Mario Kart in land, sea, and airMultiplayer: YesCompletion: 4-6 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesSonic Racing Transformed is pretty much the closest experience you'll get to Mario Kart on Steam. Since this is a fairly large genre as of late, Sega needed to come up with some sort of gimmick to make the game stand out. This game's gimmick is the ability for your vehicle to transform to handle water and air. I guess it works. It certainly keeps the laps interesting instead of going around in the same circles each time. The one annoyance is that controls of the vehicle change when it transforms. It's an added learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it can be enjoyable.The race tracks in Sonic Racing Transformed are inspired by various games from Sega franchises. I rather enjoyed the track design. I found them pleasing to look at and fun to play around in. The music remixes are also fun to listen to. In particular I enjoy the Afterburner stage and music. That one is a blast.There's several types of races you can run, but I would have liked a few more race modes. How about some kind of separate mode where you can buy upgrades for your cart with prize money you earn? Or maybe a demolition derby where you try to ram people off a track. How about an aerial dogfight battle arena?The weapons are a tad on the weak side. Very few really feel like game-changers, and the homing ability is spotty at best. They just lack the oomph that all Mario Kart weapons possess. I suppose this means that more skill is required in actual driving instead of facerolling with overpowered weapons, but I wouldn't mind a separate mode with said overpowered weapons.For the advanced racers, there's additional techniques to learn in the way of boosts, which I haven't nearly mastered yet. Mastery of this is integral to high level play.I'm baffled that there's no obvious way to change tracks in multiplayer. It's sort of hidden in the corner where you must select Options, and as far as I know, there's no random option. To the best of my knowledge, there's no grand prix  or world tour mode in multiplayer either. So far I haven't experienced much lag, if any, when playing with friends online, so that gets a good mark from me.I know it's not fair to keep comparing it to Mario Kart, but that's because it's hard not to when the game clearly takes inspiration from it. Sonic Racing Transformed might not be the best of the genre, but for Steam, it may very well be the best Kart game. I rate this game a 8.5/10.  It's a plenty good racer if you and your friends only have Steam and just want to kart race.			"

												For a game that features racing across land, sea, and air, with a drift mechanic for all three, it's astonishing how accessible this title is. About the only downside I can think of is the amount of grinding required: you'll need to complete courses on harder difficulties to unlock the full character and course roster....oh, and despite being a fantastically-optimised PC port, the graphics options can only be changed outside of the game. Looking past this pet peeve, though, I'd definitely recommend this game.			"

												Sega really did it with this game. Forget about the previous Mario Kart clone, this amazing racing game has it own personality and many things to add to the sub-genre. The graphics are amazing, the courses very well designed and full of details, and in a good computer the game will look impressive. The 3 types of vehicles are very different and give a lot of variety to the game. A lot of characters from many Sega franchises can be used, and even exclusive like a TF2 team.			"

												I got this in a sale and have been blown away by it. Excellently fun racer, fantastic local multiplayer. Controlwise, a pad is fantadtic, but it plays just as well using the keyboard. The difficulty is just right also - as a new player, I'm struggling on medium difficulty.  Hasn't stopped me desiring to replay races though!Graphically beautiful,  soundtrack is great, so many nods to Sega's history.The roster might seem a little random, but even racing with characters like Football Manager can be pretty entertaining. Best of all - no blue shells! Totally recommended.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is an extremley fun and addicting racing game much like Mario Kart, bringing back a lot of nostalgia for me back when I played hours upon hours of Mario Kart Doubledash on the Game Cube. The roster of All-Star racers rangers from iconic and not so iconic sega characters, characters from a few games and movies and even real life F1 Racer Danica Patrick... Interesting to say the least. The game can shift from three diffrent vehicle types during a race while adding stunt combos and an array of unique items to that of Mario Kart witch I actually prefer a lot more! I like this game a lot aswell as my roommates in college who regularly come in to join and play with me haha, brings back a lot of nostalgia.. And its cheaper then buying the whole game cube setup and doubledash.Pros:- Good Announcer and Sound Track- Visually stunning race maps with nice use of colors- Near Flawless Gaming Mechanics- Tons of racemodes to choose from during World Tour, Several Grand Pre races- Easy multiplayer match makingCons:- Wish there were more racers or possibly vehicle options for racers- Wish there was a bigger community of people who played this- Could possibly benefit from a DLC map pack "

												Sonic and All Stars Racing: Transformed, (or as I like to call it, SEGA All Stars Racing: Transformed) is a racing game featuring all of your favorite SEGA Characters race to the finish, as well as some random 3rd Party Characters. It features race tracks based off of worlds from Sonic games and most of SEGA's forgotten franchises and the racers vehicles transform from cars, to boats, to planes. So it's like Mario Kart 7, Diddy Kong Racing, that random Disney racing game and that Hot Wheels game that share the same idea of transforming race cars. I've never used a controller for the PC Version and I stuck to just using the keyboard, the nice thing about this is that you can adjust the controls for the keyboard to see which keys suit you more comfortably, and not just pressing random buttons all over the keyboard. The car and boat forms are cool, the boat forms are more fun as you can easily perform more tricks to get boosts. The plane form takes some time to getting used to when it comes to drifting while keeping your plane under control. The game features Career mode which is a series of different events, Grand Prix is a race to see who is the best, Time Trial is what you would expect, and Single Race is for racing on only one track, which I advise to try this feature out for practice if you just bought the game. The power ups can be useful at times, from the catchers mitt that catches the enemies weapon and being able to use it to your advantage, to chucking snowballs, ho ho ho. The All Star moves are back but are a bit disappointing. The first game featured the characters having their own specific All Star Moves with their own style and advantages, the sequel just transforms the player into the plane mode and fire's rockets at your opponents. There was also talk about special DLC that would feature more of SEGA's forgotten or internet favorite characters in the game, well it's been over a year and after that Yogscast guy was announced, I gave up on it since obviously SEGA only focuses on Sonic, they don't give a damn about their other franchises or even attempt to feature them in a new game again, and not just constantly porting their already made games onto every console. Besides, a good amount of people who bought this game only bought it just because it has Sonic characters, hence why the name Sonic is in HUGE font while the rest of the title is in smaller font. I rarely play as any of the Sonic characters from the first game (I use Bonanza Bros. all the time) and in this game. They're nothing special compared to all of SEGA's unique and forgotten creations. The 3rd Party batch of characters are very random and are just thrown in there for advertising gimmicks but hey, you can play as Pryo, Heavy and Spy that represent Team Fortress 2 in this game. So yeah, if your one of those few people that like SEGA's forgotten characters like myself, then you will enjoy this game like it's predecessor; you've got NiGHTS, Amigo, a living VMU named AGES, Vyse, Shinobi, and more.............................. but no Vectorman. :'(			"

It's simple to play, huge variety of maps and characters, fast paced, gets everyone laughing and having a great time. There are a few glitches with getting hung up on the scenery and I wish navigating between rounds was a little faster, but this is an example of Sega at the top of their game in my opinion. No, I have no sponsoship deals with them to say that. I just like the game. XD			"

It has famous SEGA characters to play with, from the classic games since before the Dreamcast era until the new ones. The flying and water controls might be a little difficult to get used to, and the challenges to gain stars to unlock new cars and features are harder than its previous title. If you like colorful tracks, cars that has guns with funny noises and effects and losing friends just like in Mario Kart, that's the game.			"

Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed is a great game, it's a game where players can race each other, there's something about that, racing people, that makes this game great, a real winner. Why just the other day I raced someone, it was a great race, great things were accomplished, and greatness was achieved. That's what this game does, it just wins and keeps being great. The races can be won, sometimes you fall behind, but does that mean you're a loser, of course, but someone has to be the winner, and that's what makes this game great, is because someone is always a winner. You have to race to win and in order to win you have to be great and that's what this game is, just something special. Thank you.			"

												This is a very well made Mario-Kart styled racing game which brings some of the iconic from Sega as you already recognized in the name of the game.There is a total of 30 playable characters in the game,each of them differ from the others,some are faster,some are slower etc.Now a big plus in this game is that the map you're playing on changes each time you reach the finish line,meaning a 3 lap race will not look the same all the time.You can be driving your kart and then all of a sudden road ends and you find yourself flying in the air while dodging many powerups your enemies throw at you.Also one of the pros is that this game has 4 person local COOP, which allows you to do the campaign with your friends.Its a big plus since in some of the events you could really use some help.You unlock your characters by completing levels and each level you get you unlock a mod for your car,which can be a speed mod,a handling mode and others.I play this game with my 7 year-old nephew and he absolutely loves it.If youre looking for a game in which you can relax and have some fun then this is the game for you.But be warned you need 2 controllers for COOP.Now the only con is that sometimes its buggy and the AI are extremely difficult if you crank up the settings.In some events you get absolutely annihilated and it kinda makes you rage.My final verdict is a very,very solid 9/10.

												Do you like Mario Kart?Do you think it's too slow?Do you wish it had a 500cc mode?Then this is the game for you! Maybe it's not like 500cc, but probably around 300cc. I played this a lot and then went back to Mario Kart DD on the GC and it was really slow. This game is a lot more fun as any Mario Kart game I have ever played. If you enjoy racing games overall, you need to try this game at least.There is some problems on older low specced computers as well, just keep that in mind. It can also crash from time to time as well, but it's not too bad.The music is also great, but can get repetitive after a while. Haven't found a way to change it yet either. For some reason the decided to compress it in a completely other way than all the other Sonic games. That may be because it uses VAC and if you modify the music files you could get a VAC ban or something probably. That also means that there are no mods for this game, which kinda sucks.Anyway, it's a great game.I give this game 9/10.			"

												I hated this game when I first played. I didn't like the tracks switching almost every lap. I didn't like the controls. I didn't like any aspect of it. Then my friend forced this game upon me by buying it and I'm glad he did. I really enjoy this game. The gameplay is pretty rock solid. This game is also certified local co-op! It's as easy as pressing start!""Another Super Mario Kart clone"". Perhaps, but this game does it's best to make sure your paying attention at all times. There is always an opportunity to boost or get ahead but proper steps need to be taken in order to make it to first. The biggest difference in this game in regards to other race battle games is that drifting (to acquire boost) is essentially critical. You don't have to hit an arrow to receive a boost. Rather drifting for a certain amount of time will give you a basic turbo. Keep drifting though and notice the color of your thrusters changing colors. Going from red to blue, you'll notice a definite kick to your character upon doing a successful drift. This is a big feature in this game where now it doesn't seem really appealing, but upon playing it the game mechanics will pull you in. On top of that, don't forget you can do tricks with the right stick if you want more boost!Is there weapons in this game? Of course! Some weapons (and defensive weapons) included are baseball glove (that catches and gives you the weapon fire at you), freeze-balls with the ability to freeze opponents, blowfish that sit like mines, wasp swarms that set up ""roadblocks"", a rocket that locks on to opponents, a firecracker that fires in a straight line, ""going all-star"" which is similar to Mario Kart's star except you can shoot specialized rockets that rebound and follow, boost and explosive hot rod engines. The beauty of firing weapons is that you have the OPTION of shooting them backwards or forwards. This is a neat feature as this adds another depth to the game.The tracks themselves (to say the least) are unique. I imagine it wasn't easy designing one course that would transform throughout the race. I should mention that the ""Transformed"" actually means that your mode of transportation transforms. It can either be a car, a (hover)boat or an airplane. So combine that with the tracks and you can get some challenging races but some over the top scenery to dodge. ""Drifting"" around a dinosaur in an airplane while trying to go through a boost while trying to shoot at an enemy is no easy work. The levels definitely seem like a lot of attention has been given to them.On top of all this, they've added different game modes. The main menu offers career mode, match making and custom game. What is really cool is (local) players can play online as well as play in career mode! Having a hard time with a time attack? Wouldn't hurt to have a buddy to help you out. Some of the varying game modes include boost challenges, evasion, time attack, single race and even attack simulations where you have to destroy a tank while dodging his attacks. Characters themselves have the ability to level up (depending on how much you play with them) and your buddies character can level up at the same time. Upon leveling up, you will unlock certain modifiers for your car (such as boost to acceleration, handling etc...).The visuals are decent graphics but it seems they attempted to pay attention to every little detail. For example, in the main menu there aren't much options regarding maps (as they haven't been unlocked). Upon unlocking them, you'll see more of these maps on your main screen. The maps as I've said are really interesting and really neat to play through. The characters at times will seem to fall out of their vehicle while doing stunts or boosting.The sounds are actually very good as each individual character has different dialogue for different situations. Little diversity concerning the explosion sounds and it would have been complete. I should add that when the announcer is saying 3-2-1 go that the player should hit ""accelerate"" (or RT) every time he says a number. This will give you a boost at the start.Overall, a really good game. It gives Mario Kart a run for it's money  but I wouldn't say it's better or worse. It's tough to compare the two but Sonic Racing is definitely fun.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :  The usual screen you'll be seeing Drifting and boosting Really not a fan of player 2 being first ""Flyyyy like an eagle"" Nice glimpse into the scenery "

												Do you like Mario Kart?Do you think it's too slow?Do you wish it had a 500cc mode?Then this is the game for you! Maybe it's not like 500cc, but probably around 300cc. I played this a lot and then went back to Mario Kart DD on the GC and it was really slow. This game is a lot more fun as any Mario Kart game I have ever played. If you enjoy racing games overall, you need to try this game at least.There is some problems on older low specced computers as well, just keep that in mind. It can also crash from time to time as well, but it's not too bad.The music is also great, but can get repetitive after a while. Haven't found a way to change it yet either. For some reason the decided to compress it in a completely other way than all the other Sonic games. That may be because it uses VAC and if you modify the music files you could get a VAC ban or something probably. That also means that there are no mods for this game, which kinda sucks.Anyway, it's a great game.I give this game 9/10.			"

												Make that a thumb sideways.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a mix of Mario Kart-like randomness and chaos, and Trackmania-like skill-based precision racing, and then some more.So it is a game with several very different game-modes and race types, in singleplayer you'll go through all of them, wether you like them all or not. How much fun you will have depends on what kind of preferences of racing game types you have, and I'll try to point out those things in this review.First off, if you're a completionist, going for 100% achievements or as close to that as possible, this game is quite ok into the 70-80% region, and then it becomes difficult, even frustrating, and a game of chance much more than a game of skill. That's a very clear thumbs down from this perspective. Most people don't care about that but I wanted to mention it for those who do.If you're a fan of fun racers with random weapon pickups, this game has alot of that, in singleplayer aswell as multiplayer.The randomness is really really prominent in singleplayer races against AI. No matter how good you are, winning in the hardest (""expert"", unlockable) and second-to-hardest difficulty modes is very difficult mostly, and when you win, you don't have the feeling that you did that, but you just got lucky with the pickups and the enemy AI's rubberband mechanism. Someone might be out there who does enjoy that kind of racing, but I didn't. As mentioned, it's the central part of the game.If you're a fan of driving skill based racing with no element of randomness, this game has some of that, too, and I happen to like those parts. The higher difficulties are a challenge, but it's how well you race that makes the difference, and there's a clear sense of progress and improvement with each retry. You memorize the courses, you spot shortcuts, get a feel for the physics model (unrealistic but that's ok) and the different unlockable drivers that handle differently, and most importantly you learn how to get ""boosts"" by performing slides around corners and stunts during jumps. So you have to keep an eye out for opportunities to do that, and pull it off with some skill and precision. I enjoyed these kinds of races the most. They come in different variations and make up about 1/3rd of the singleplayer game. Those variations are racing against the clock/against a pre-recorded non-random ghost, racing against AI but without weapons, drift challenges, boost challenges, and ring races in air levels.There are sections in the levels (with varying extent per level) of air and boat racing, that handle quite a bit differently. The air controls are a disaster, imho. The slower you are, the faster you turn, which is ok on paper, but it makes handling steep curves extremely imprecise and frustrating, especially when the curve is not only left/right, but at the same time upwards/downwards. They should have looked at the 15 year old Pilotwings 64 to get an idea of how to design good, uncomplicated but precise controls for such a game mode.The great downside to the game as a whole is, that, unless you happen to like all of these different kinds of racing, you'll hate some parts of the game. Due to how the singleplayer progression is designed, you can't really ignore those parts, if you want to progress through the game.			"

												It is currently the free weekend for this game, and all it took, was a single, short race, in order for me to purchase it! I love this game. I've been hooked on it, all day. My brother and I have had several matches, I've been on single-player a fair bit, and I've played with some random people, online. All in all, my experience, so far, has been a great deal of fun, and wowing at the surprisingly tasty visuals, given the style of graphics.The game runs beautifully for myself, with an ASUS 760 OC, and my brother, with an XFX HD-5750. You might well have already gathered, but this game is simply not that graphically taxing. My brother and I both have an FX-4100 - mine is overclocked to 4.2GHz, whereas my brother's CPU is at stock, and for him, the game runs at 60fps, at a 900p resolution, with everything maxed, except he has motion blur disabled. I have even gone a step futher, and forced 8x Supersampling, and 16xQ CSAA - the game still runs butter-smooth. So, to summerize, this game should run beautifully, provided you're not running a computer with a Pentium CPU, 32MB SD-RAM, an ATI Rage 4MB GPU, and Windows 95, like my first Windows computer!One of the things I love about any game, are things that I can unlock and earn. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has more under the hood, than you might initially think. You'll see on Steam, that there are in-fact - as of this review's post date - 50 Steam achievements to earn. To my knowledge, there are 144 career stars to earn, ranging from various game-modes, with 3 difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. There is a GP mode (Grand Prix) allowing for 10 Grand Prix Wins. Time Attack mode sports 40 tracks on which to race, 20 being entirely different. There are 160 Staff Ghosts to beat, and each one is a different difficulty of time made on each track, from Easy to Expert. The game has 28 vehicles/characters to choose from, each with Mods, totaling 168 unlockable Mods, and if that wasn't enough, they can each be leveled up 6 times, using a simple experience system. While playing the game, you will do some impressive, and not-so-impressive things, earning you stickers - there are 100 stickers to collect, 3 of which can be shown-off on your license.As of the post date, there 2 bits of DLC available to you, currently £4.98 in total. I must admit, the DLC doesn't interest me, as I simply don't feel it justified to pay for minor content I feel might as well have just been in the game, at launch. To each their own, as they say.I do find the graphics to be very pleasant. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed uses only DirectX 9, so don't expect flashy DirectX 11 features; this is a Sonic racing game, pure and simple.The music gives me a sense of nostalgia, with that unmistakable, Sega sound, however, after a while, the constant ""Sega sound"" blaring in your ears, may start to drive you crazy, so consider turning down that music, or disabling it!The controls are tight, simple, and easy enough to learn, provided you don't struggle with the TV remote, or putting on slippers. The wired XBOX 360 controller, works like a dream with this Sonic game, so don't hesitate to plug it and press that Start button. In-fact, it's so nice and comfy with the controller, that I've never tried it with the K&M!You might be wondering whether the multiplayer modes are any good - well, from where I'm sitting, they are great, with all the typical game modes found in single-player, and the ability to choose the very same characters/vehicles you've been leveling up and modding, all of which adds to a brilliant experience with your family, mates, or indeed strangers.All in all, I've had a lot of fun on this little gem, and I would certainly, strongly recommend it to any Sonic fan, or a fan of relatively old-school, kart-style racing.

-Quick Review-Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is a Racing game developed by Sumo Digital, and released Jan 31, 2013. To sum up the game, it's basically like playing Mario Kart but with more content.(I don't want to say better or worse then Mario Kart, it really should be counted as it's own ""kart"" game, and not a knock off or anything like that)


There are three kart modes: Car, Boat, and Plane/Jet.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There's no story here, I could totally make one up for you though... With riviting details about how Sonic Team has sold their blue heghog to the highest bidder, and is now enslaved in a kart game where he must prove himself to be the best to win each and every game so that he will be able to compete in the obligatory Mario Vs Sonic Kart Game which will someday be developed (or was already developed and no one cared because it was for the wii-u)!*links my blog site where you can read more fan art*My Xbox 1 controller doesn't work: I recently purchased an x-box 1 controller and have been trying to cover controller controls on games with my reviews, but for this one apparently it doesn't like my xbox 1 controller. I just grabbed an x-box controller, I didn't know some games don't like 'em. I even tried downloading a button mapper which would emulate a regular x-box controller... no dice.In the end it was too much work, and I just concluded I'll get better with a keyboard and mouse, the problem is you don't know all the buttons unless you read a guide or somehow guess each button.Here's the basic's to get you started: Space is Drift, arrow keys will direct you, Shift to accelerate (P.S. your pinky-finger will hate you after a few races), and E to fire a weapon. You can also flip using WASD but I forget about the flips because I'm a baddy mcbad-face.If you want to save some time, check out any of the top rated Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed beginer's guides located here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212480/guides/Gameplay: There are three game play types in Sonic All stars racing transformed (Yeeesh that's a lot to type, can we just call it Sonico-kart? No? what's that? there's a ""Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing"" game in my library I will be reviewing eventually too? Well crap.)


The Campaign's Career character unlock and navigation Sample - Uploaded for Steam Review.

There are three game types: Career, Match Making, and Custom Game.For the Career you play against the AI, having easy, medium, and hard difficulty NPC's. In world tour there are 5 worlds and roughly 8 levels each world, plus character unlocks. In Grand Prix there are 5 cups, and 4 races per cup, lastly there's a lot of levels in time attack and single race mode (as you can imagine you can play all the levels individually, and there are also bonus levels!)Regarding Match making, you can play online in three game modes: Race, Arena, and Lucky Dip, there are also respective stats, win loss ratio, games played wins, and ratings, for all you junkies who aren't desensitized yet.Custom Game is exclusively for multiplayer, you can play local co-op, if you have enough controllers plugged in, you can play with up to 4 friends locally (we actually did do this when my brothers came to visit, they beat most of the Career for me... wait, should I not admit that?) and online you can play with your online friends.Okay, so we've talked about the types of game modes, and pretty well spelled out there's a lot of different levels to keep you busy for some time... How does the game FEEL?Well, it feels like a Mario Kart Game, but with Sonic Characters and Danica Patrick. (I don't know jack about racing people, but apparently she's in this game, along with other Sega characters, Wreck it Ralf, and... who the heck is Pudding?) You race along a course, the course will sometimes change on the last lap of a race, you pick up items, some will boost you, some will you aim and throw, others help the last place scrublord like me while playing online (...you could at least let me win one people, come on!)


As you play, you will unlock mods for the characters you're playing which will change how the vehicle preforms.  - Uploaded for Steam Review

Conclusion:  I'm not the best person to speak to when it comes to potential that a racing game has because I'm not particularly skilled at them to begin with, but I could easily see this game being the type of game you play with a group of friends like many of us used to do back in our Mario Kart Days on the N64. (Appeal to Nolstalgia successful *blows off gun smoke)What I'm trying to say is; I liked it. I'll play it more, I'm not good at it, but I don't feel like I need to be good at something to enjoy it.Hopefully this review has been either entertaining, informative, or inspiring. My name's Atratzu and I approve this review.			"

You can pick your character, the mode which you will use in racing, you can represent your badges/stickers in online play, you can play different modes, play World Cup, Tour... and alot of things. The best thing that they have made - Graphics, Gameplay. It is really fun and relaxing to race along with such beautiful maps, and such smooth controlls. This game has a few mistakes, issues, and things.. [Controllers, Controller Menu, Settings, Glitches] But it doesn't make it bad. This is one of the best racing games, and it will stay the best!If you never played this, you are missing a bunch, so why are you looking at the reviews, you are suppose to play this beautiful game!Rate: 60/10			"

												I love to play this very fun arcade racer with my Girlfriend and Friends in Big Picture @ Home TV with Xbox 360 Controller. It has online multiplayer as well as local multiplayer.Its like Mario Kart, but i think its better. (yes, hate me for that)DO NOT play with a keyboard and mouse!!!!The Game:Boost, drift, find new power-ups and shoot enemys. Discover alternate routes and level up your Character to get better skills.Each character is equipped with their own unique vehicle that can transform into a car, boat and plane to take advantage of the changing terrains.Fun gameplay, no over powered weapons, and a good sense of speed. If you like games like Mario Kart then you will love this. DO NOT buy it for 10 @ Amazon or 20 @ Steam (and 20€ = 20 $ ?? the prices are not correct...) but get the Game @ Steam-Sale for 5 Bugs or in a Bundle (Humble Bundle etc.). (In addition @ Steam the DLC for this game is worthless, they  just adding new characters. WTF? SEGA = EA ?)			"

The racing mechanics are tight as tight, the tracks are numerous, varied and interesting and there's enough content in the game to keep you playing for a long time.

Note: I have not completed the game yet, I am writing the review as a ""first impressions"" kind of thing.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. I recently acquired the game on a sale, as it looked like a fun little racer. I went into the game pretty much blindfolded, not sure of what to expect.Gameplay and World:Good:» Tons of special modes like VS-Mode, drift-challange, boost-challange, etc.» Unique and beautiful tracks, which can even change inbetween laps.» Lots of choosable characters with different strengths and weeknesses.» In-depth risk and reward boost-system (boost for stunts and drifts).» Many fun powerups to use.» Surprisingly difficult on harder difficulties.» Options for touch-inputs and different sensors. Not something I'd use, but that is a very rare feature to see.Bad:» All PC-Related settings, like graphics and controls, have to be set in a broken and cheap-looking launcher.» How the AI uses powerups can be very frustrating at times, ruining the flow of the race.» Some characters feel very out of place. Some are more cartoony than others.» Drifting + Braking/Reverse use the same key, which makes sense on a controller, but not on a keyboard.» Shadows look kind of grainy, even on high graphics-settings.» Nitpick: Default keyboard layout is horrible (can be changed in the launcher tho).Misc:Settings:Ingame, only some gameplay and sound-settings are available. When you get the launcher to work (running as administrator), you have lots of graphics settings to your disposal. Every resolution seems to be supported. The launcher is just not clear on what kind of anti-aliasing it uses (spoiler: it's FXAA).Performance:This game performs beautifully! Surprisingly, I was able to get it running on my Windows-Tablet (Intel Atom, with integrated graphics) at 640x400 with 15-30 FPS. Would not have thought that it would get anywhere near that. So feel free to try this on a low/mid-spec PC, it's very well optimized.Summary:I was positively suprised by this game. I had my fears that this was gonna be some arcade-racer for kids, without any difficulty whatsoever, but it definitely proved itself to be a challenging and fun racing-game. If you like arcade-racers like Mario Kart and you are searching for an equivilant on PC, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is for you. Although it might be a little hard to get into if you are new to the racing-game genre. Definitely give it a spin!			"

												Oh god, so much memories awoken by this game, awesome animation, graphics and tracks. Soundtrax made me cry. God, I really love it. I recommend it to anyone, even to these who never played Sonic game series. It got lots more tracks than Sonic And SEGA All Stars Racing, and more events, though Misson section got changed, and has different structure. There are more Grand Prix'es than your eye can see, plus multiplayer mode to play with your friends or random people in Steam. This game is freakin' AWESOME!!!			"

												Probably the best cart game in years.  Being able to transform in to a cart, boat, or plane during the race really adds the the content and makes it more exciting.  Being able to switch difficulties makes it harder for better players and easier for new players.  Not being able to switch difficulties in mario cart WII was one big problem for me.  It gets to easy over time.  With Transformed that never happens you make it as hard as you like(and let me tell you it is hard).  It is also one of the few 4 player splitscreen PC games out there.  PC gamer also gave it one more point on it's review score then Battlefield 4 lol.  Game: 8/10 (weapons and abilities could be improved seem boring, not very elaborate. No funny announcer like in the first one, also wish they had all the old characters from the first game)			"

												For fans of the Mario Kart series, you will not be disappointed.Most clones of Mario Kart tend to be pretty terrible. Nearly unplayable, with ugly graphics, horribly designed stages, uninteresting characters, and just... not very fun to play in the slightest. They tend to be just quick cash ins on the Mario Kart crowd. Sega's latest crossover extraveganza doesn't fail to please. While, at the core, it may look like just your typical Mario Kart clone, it is so much more. Not only do you race by car, but mid-race, you could find your car transforming into a boat or plane.There's a single player campaign mode that allows you to play through a ton of challenges. Drifting, tank fights, flying through rings, and standard races. There's plenty to see and do in All-Stars Racing Transformed. There's a huge variety of weapons at your disposal to take out the competition and while not as interesting as those found in the Mario Kart series, they are fun to use and do the job. With 20 tracks (21 if you count the DLC track) and a currently still ever growing roster of characters, the fun is endless.Did I mention the online is fantastic, as well? Because it is. It's your standard online with 5 different game modes, but there is absolutely no lag, which is always a plus.So, if you're a fan of Mario Kart and also love SEGA and their IPs, you'll love this game.

												One of the best kart racing game on the PC. It brings back my fond childhood memory (I've played Crash Team Racing on PS1)!The race changes during each lap which brings a refreshing experience. This game is very much skill-based and having a paint scratch might make a difference between winning and losing the game. There's a lack of weapon variety but you still have to use them wisely. Overall, awesome soundtracks, great multiplayer, and the game runs smoothly on my GT 335M and an ultra low voltage CPU, which is a darn good console port. Not to mention the near-obsolete split-screen support! I recommend buying this if you are going to play with your friends or even alone.			"

												This has got to be one of the best kart racing games on PC. Rivaling giants like Crash Team Racing and Mario Kart.You get plenty of vibrant stages and characters to choose from. You can play the local career with 4 people or do racing in a variety of modes: single races, time attacks, capture the Chao or cup races and can also take part in battle modes locally, online for up to 10 player or even combined.And I didn't even get into the awesome power up system, the Transforming vehicles and stages that transform each lap.Simply put this game is packing content and you should already have it in your Steam library if you love Racing Games like Mario Kart. Or have ever wanted to try these types of games out.			"

B.D. Joe & All-Stars Racing Transformed is wonderfully arcadey, bright, colorful, runs silky-smooth and is generally a truckload (or boatload (or planeload)) of fun to play. It's the best racing game I've played in a long time.+ Colors! Cheer!+ Arcadey+ Challenging+ Makes very effective use of Wii-tier models & textures - Looks great and runs very nicely+ I've only played a couple of the games represented in this game for a few minutes apiece and I still love almost all of the characters (Amigo)+ Good soundtrack+ Lag shouldn't effect your movement too much online, with one major exception...- Vehicle-on-vehicle collisions online. Good God, the vehicle-on-vehicle collisions online. Some games try to handle physics but it still doesn't work too good. This game just doesn't handle physics. They don't even work for the host player. Works okay offline, though.- S-Class AI tends to be a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- There is a ramp on Burning Depths that you can crash into while trying to go over it, and you will lose if this happens. This is dumb.Verdict: I love it.9/10			"

												Mario Kart for PC. They did an amazing job with this game, the level design is really well done and the way the levels change from lap to lap leading to seemless boat and air sections is brilliant. Loads of your favourite SEGA characters from Sonic, Nights, crazy taxi, and loads more and even a couple of wacky ones such as football manager. HIGHLY recommended, especially if you have a few buddies to play against. Worth the full price even in my opinion.Game Showcase-

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Tranformed is possibly the most underrated game I've seen on steam thus far.I mean, it's a massive shame it's not getting the attention it deserves because this game is a brilliant racing game.The game's gameplay is more a kart racing in the sense of Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, you got item pick ups such as missles, shields, bombs, etc. Most items are very similar to games like Mario kart, such as the firework which works the same way as the green turtle shell. However this game has an item known as ""All star!"", this item is very rare and once you find one, you can turn into your charater's special ability, which can range from Sonic's Super Sonic form, Eggman's barrage of missles and so on and so forth.In terms of character selection there is a wide range of characters, starting with Sonic the Hedgehog (duh), NiGHTS, Ai Ai from monkey ball, beat from Jet set Radio and pudding from space channel 5. Exclusive for the PC version of the game are the Spy, heavy and Pyro from Team fortress 2, Shogun from Total War, Football manager from Football manager and General  Winter from Company of heroes 2, who are pretty halarious to see in a Kart racing game. The main meat of the game is World Tour mode, this is where you complete a variy of races and modes to gain stars to unlock more levels, characters until you reach the end. Then you got your usual modes such as racing and some new ones like drift challenges.The tracks are varied taking locations from games such as golden axe, Sonic, NiGHTS, etc.One new feature of All-Stars Racing Transformed from it's predecessor is the ability to transform your vehicle into a boat and plane. When the environment allows it, you can change into a plane to fly fast and take shortcuts, or transform into a boat to scale the seas, this system was very well implemented and I never really had any trouble controlling these different types of navagation.The visuals of the locations, car models and character models are also really beautiful, with bright colours, lush environments and crisp texutres, although the character victory animations are rather stiff.Speaking of victory animations, I've noticed that a lot of voice acting is reused from other games such as Sonic Generations, which while bothering, didn't subtract from the experience overall.The music is also top notch, very varied and are candy to my ears. In the end, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a fantastic racing game, and shouldn't be overlooked.Seriously, it's fantastic, so much so that it is possibly the best racing game I've played on the PC.Good job Sumo Digital.9/10			"

												One of the most underrated karting game of all time (Note, by underrated, I don't mean that people hate it, but rather that no one really cares about it). I could ramble a very long time about why you should give it a chance, but here are some good things about it.1: The maps are well designed and can give you a bit of a nostalgic feeling if you grew up with SEGA. The maps are also not that linear compared to other racing games.2: The gimmick of transforming into other forms of vehicles actually works really well and doesn't feel tacked on.3: Variety isn't a problem with this game, as there are many different modes and challenges.4: It's on PC!5: Graphics wise, it looks very nice.6: It's tonnes of fun.Because this is a review, here are a few bad things.1: The character roster has Danica Patrick... Seriously?2: MotionInJoy doesn't work well with the game. (I know that I can't really blame the game, but I had to think of a negative thing :P)  OVERALL:9/10Thanks for reading my review :)			"

												I normally don't care for anything 'Sonic,' having grown up with Mario, and I don't care much for cart racers also but man, this game is awesome. Loads better than Mario Kart, in my opinion, with better design, flow, weapons, track layouts, presentation, etc. Don't really like the boat parts, but the car and plane parts is really fun. No cheap♥♥♥♥♥weapons like MK's stupid blue shells.I don't really know any of these characters besides the PC exclusive ones and Sonic ones (obviously), but that doesn't stop me from having a blast with this game. This is a must buy for cart racers, even if you hate Sonic and/or cart racers.			"

												Racing games have been a huge genre in the gaming industry, most racing games are really popular, like Mario Kart, Forza, etc., and there are really bad ones like Big Rigs Over the Road Racing. Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog in the late 90's made their own spinoff Sonic Racing games, but the first one's were Sonic R, and Sonic Drift, these two games were considered by many to be terrible. then during the time of the PS2, Sega released a new franchise called ""Sega Superstars,"" this game was really mediocre because it was one of the few games on the system to use the Playstation Eye, but it registered poorly, so the game was not good. Sega decided to step back into racing in 2006, with Sonic Riders, released for Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, and PC, this game was much better than Sonic R and Drift, it was different because unlike most racing games, this racing game used hoverboards, and a sequel was released in 2008.2 years after Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sega decided to revive Sega Superstars with a tennis game before 2010, and in 2010, we got Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This racing game released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PC, recevied really positive reviews. So much that it could start comparing to Mario Kart.2 short years after Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing, we got the game were talking about today... Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. Released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, PC, 3DS, PSVita, and mobile devices. So, is this a good racing game? Yes. The graphics on PC are stunning, especially in Max Settings, running 60fps, the colors are bright and colorful, and the small blur affects make the game a bit more intense. The gameplay plays like its original, Steer, Accelerate, Drift to charge up a mini turbo, and do tricks in mid air, which is replaced by flicking the right control stick in a specific direction, (I'm assuming you have a controller) the trick system is a lot simpler and quicker than the original.The main gimic of this game is the ability to transform your kart into a boat, or plane, in boat form, you can ride the waves and  perform tricks by jumping off waves, specifically big ones, and even ride on hot lava, literally. In plane form, you can fly around in the air, while doing barrel rolls to dodge mid air obstacles, such as giant dinosaurs, construction areas, magic bookshelves, and flying aircrafts.The game has a wide variety of modes, race, grand prix, time attack, world tour, battle mode, and even online, and the game has 20 race tracks and a large selection of Sega characters, and I mean it. You can even level up your favorite character and unlock mods for your character to customize their stats! So you can use your favorite character and still have good stats! Also, there are a handfull of collectable stickers and badges to put on your ID card.The soundtrack in this game is really good, with many remixes, but voice clips are resused from past Sega games. But it is still nice to listen to to say the least.If I had to give a final verdict on the game, I would say if Sega's goal was to make a racing game that uses features from many other Sega franchises, and bundle it all into one epic racing game, than they accomplished that very well, the gameplay is good, the soundtrack is epic, the online is fun, the selection of characters is great, and the graphics are beautiful to look at on the PC, but not so much on the Console versions of the game. This is a fantastic racing game that will keep you playing for hours, and has really fun online, I can safely say that this is one of the best racing games out there. I score this game with a 9/10. $20 is a good price, but in the steam sales, $5 is ridiculous, you better buy this in the sales! I reccomend this to any racing fan out there! "

												Great looking kart racer.Perfect to play with friends and I didn't have any problems trying to play an MP game, even in the middle of the night.However after Medium difficulty, the SP AI starts cheating pretty hard, and in order to even catch up, you have to perfect all the trick boosts and not miss a single track boost. Even then, 1 or 2 shots on you will probably knock you out of the race, and all AI drivers will be focused on attacking you.So it pretty much turns into a 9v1 gauntlet.It wasn't fun for me to try to complete the game like that, but for people who enjoy the challenge, and like perfecting all the tracks and don't mind some cheaty AI, then you will probably put many many hours into this.

												don't mind my little play-time because we usually play this game 4-player splitscreen (we even did 2x2=8 players once with two computers) with a projector at a friend's house. for the whole of last year, we came to a point that going out at a pub and getting a (social) life was far far behind in terms of priority compared to these small parties that we get wasted and play sonic for hours and hours. the whole crew kinda got lost in various MOBAs but we can't stop getting back to Sonic from time and time again.and even though we usually play this game sharing a couch, it still is the first game i restore after a routine format to my hard drive.

												Easily one of the most consistent comic racing experiences I have personally had the pleasure of encountering since... Mario Kart Wii. You have a lot of characters to choose from (and they all look brilliant) You have a healthy selection of tracks borrowing the settings of a plethora of your favorite SEGA titles The music will blow your socks off Items are plenty fair The game itself looks stunning and doesn't ask for much in regards to specs Transformation is a magical gimmick like no other Plenty of game modes to choose from and online isn't necessarily as dead as it is on console I can go on all day about the things I like about this game so I'll stop myself short; it's all praise from here except for just one thing: Diversify your character selection to avoid the grind that is maxing out your entire roster.On sale or full price you'll find it hard to regret the buy.

												What can I say about this game ? I absolutely loved it when I first got it in 2012 and still play it all the time now in 2016. I've completed it 100% on so many different platforms and it never gets boring ! It's so much fun to play either single player OR multiplayer. The visuals are colourful and appealing, the level design is great, huge array of characters from throughout SEGA's history, the controls/handling is bang on and the soundtrack is great as well. There's loads of replay value as rather than just having races/GP to do, you have staff ghosts to beat (Which trust me, some are EXTREMELY hard on expert and you'll have to seriously 'get good' to beat them), and tons of challenges to do to earn stars to unlock new characters and MODS for the vehicles. The game is especially fun for long time SEGA fans with the track remixes and older characters making an appearence :) 100% recommend, worth every penny. There aren't enough good karting games that are fun both singleplayer and multiplayer that have a variety of things to do and this definitely gives even Mario Kart a proper run for it's money, in fact I much prefer it.

												it was worth for me after i heard that voice saying ""SEEEEEGGGAAAAAA"" at the beginning like if you play sonic on a sega megadrive/genesis but let me tell u something about the game. u have diffrent modes like Worldtour (where u can do challenges like drift-challenge, battle-challenge, ring-challenge where u get stars to unlock new challenges), Grand Prix, Race against time (vs staff ghosts too) and Single race. this is mostly standard i know but there is this awesome ""Player 2 connected* voice after u press the start button on a controler up to 4 players (you can make the voice rage too by rapidly press the button with 4 mates local) and you can play everything in the game with your local friends, (dat means every mode even online vs 6 others.) online you can play with 10 players in races or battle modes. The music is typically beginning of 2000 videogames and the background animations are like in every sega game wonderful, u got very much to see if u can handle it while drivin. and dont forget this is ""Transformed""... this means u transform between a boat, car and a plane wich is awesome (the boat isnt that much but hey the other guys around the world dont like it too) so if you have friends (dont laugh, some dont have) then buy this on a sale, buy a sixpack for you and your 3 friends, prepare 1 (really guys, i recommend just one) spliff and you will get a really funny night. repeat it every time you had a bad day but just if you dont have to work the next day cuz u cant stop with friends.

												I was a fan of Sonic from a very early age, and the only Nintendo products in our house were Gameboys, yet I still never thought I'd buy this game. During the 2012 holiday sale I bought the Sonic bundle (before this game was added to it) but I figured this would be no great loss, because after all it's just another Mario Kart clone right? Perhaps and also perhaps not. Sonic has a lot more going on than any other kart game I've played, and doesn't have the same obvious rubber banding that is present on the more recent versions of Mario Kart, which leaves you feeling more in control of what is actually happening on screen rather than having Nintendo pushing you along with magic bullets and saying ""That's it just a little further, the rest of them aren't that far in front of you"" before walloping the person in first place for making the other kids look bad. The Sonic karts handle nicely, the ability to perform stunts has been added to get speed boosts, tracks attempt to cause sensory overload in the most excruciatingly pleasing way possible, and your kart frequently transforms into a boat or plane depending on how the track has been destroyed since your last lap or whatever obstacle is coming up. This is a great game to play with friends, but it's equally as good to play by yourself given all the challenges and unlocks that are available. Unlocks based on game progression are absolutely how this sort of game should be done, so I was somewhat disappointed to find that Sega had released a robotic Sonic DLC - but assuming this is just a skin I suppose you can't blame them for trying to wring every last cent out of us. Mind you, this game was a gift so I'm in no position to have a whinge about that. Had I not been given this game, I wouldn't have realised just how good it is, and how it is well worth buying.			"

												One of the most underrated karting game of all time (Note, by underrated, I don't mean that people hate it, but rather that no one really cares about it). I could ramble a very long time about why you should give it a chance, but here are some good things about it.1: The maps are well designed and can give you a bit of a nostalgic feeling if you grew up with SEGA. The maps are also not that linear compared to other racing games.2: The gimmick of transforming into other forms of vehicles actually works really well and doesn't feel tacked on.3: Variety isn't a problem with this game, as there are many different modes and challenges.4: It's on PC!5: Graphics wise, it looks very nice.6: It's tonnes of fun.Because this is a review, here are a few bad things.1: The character roster has Danica Patrick... Seriously?2: MotionInJoy doesn't work well with the game. (I know that I can't really blame the game, but I had to think of a negative thing :P)  OVERALL:9/10Thanks for reading my review :)			"

												I normally don't care for anything 'Sonic,' having grown up with Mario, and I don't care much for cart racers also but man, this game is awesome. Loads better than Mario Kart, in my opinion, with better design, flow, weapons, track layouts, presentation, etc. Don't really like the boat parts, but the car and plane parts is really fun. No cheap♥♥♥♥♥weapons like MK's stupid blue shells.I don't really know any of these characters besides the PC exclusive ones and Sonic ones (obviously), but that doesn't stop me from having a blast with this game. This is a must buy for cart racers, even if you hate Sonic and/or cart racers.			"

												30 hours. All EXPERT events cleared.When it showed ""Congratulations! You are an all-star player"" in the end, I remembered the days I was playing SSAR years ago. I was a high school student then, but not before I became a sophomore did I play SART. And I have been a Sonic fan for about ten years.K let's get into the game. While SSAR is too simple as a racing game, SART is much better. More complicated and hardcore controlling is needed if you want to play SART. Transforming into three different types and different tracks in different laps are also very enjoyable. Unlike SSAR, different characters and different mods are a lot more different in performance. I have to admit that I didn't believe it until at a boost challenge I had failed for hours with Shadow but cleared it only one time with Tails.NPCs in HARD mode and EXPERT mode are cheating. They are usually quicker than us and can accurately hit back, which is very annoying. And other challenges like boost challenge give us very little time. In this game, not every character can finish every challenge. If you get stuck at one event, try changing for another character. I recommend Sonic(Genesis Mod) and Tails(Standard or Handle). The former is heavenly fast while boosting, and the latter is surprisingly flexible. Beginners may have a hard time going through the events, but when they practice for some time, they are sure to complete the EXPERTs. In a word, the challenges in SART are a bit easier than those in SSAR. I can still remember the time I struggling in a star-ring-collecting rank S challenge in SSAR - that was HELL.Like SSAR, SART also has a strange sense of gravity. For example, if you are hit when running upside down, you will not fall off the road. However, it feels good to some extent, for example I enjoy the map Casino Park. Similar to SSAR, maps in SART are all originated from other SEGA games expect one map. But some maps in SART directly come from SSAR, only with a few fixes. Anyway, repetition is better than none.There are few bugs in SART, although mysterious trick fails and turn-arounds happen sometimes.Cars in SART, in my opinion, might be lack of characteristics. SSAR is good, where Tails's car is a plane like the Tornado and Shadow's is a motorcycle from GUN. However in SSAR, Tails's car is just a yellow racing car, and instead of the motorcycle, GUN gave Shadow... a dodgem? lolIn conclusion SART is a good game worth to play. But if you ask me to recommend a Sonic racing game, I would recommend Sonic Riders series. Why don't SEGA bring Sonic Riders on Steam? Never know.P.S. I am not a native English speaker. Sorry for some errors in language.			"

												This game is the next installment of the Sonic & All Stars series, with the first one called Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing. This game has taken the faults of the original game and fixed them, giving you plenty of difficult challenges that will take multiple attempts to complete. The 'transformed' side appeals to the unique change of vehicle throughout the levels, with your vehicle being able to become a car, boat or plane. The car designs are all very well done and represent each character perfectly and each franchise characters belong to usually have a course that corresponds with them. (i.e Egg Hangar for Sonic or Shibuya Downtown for Jet Set Radio) The courses have three laps in most cases and the surroundings change with each level, some telling stories of what's going around you, like a flying pirate ship takeover in the Skies of Arcadia level. They're all very well animated and beautiful to look at, with not a single dull level in the roster, my favourite being Dream Valley, reminiscent of NiGHTS. You have a choice of doing the career tour mode or individual races, with each cup having levels from C-A and when you unlock it, S. These make the races/challenges harder for you to earn star points, which buys console mods, characters and gateways to the next cup. I struggle at getting A's, it's incredibly hard to do and takes many tries to figure out the best way to approach a challenge, such as defeating a tank with rocket launchers, drifting in glowing roads before the time runs out or speed racing a ghost character. Overall, it's the best racing game in Sonic's history and I daresay its better than the recent Mario Karts by miles, purely for how much detail went into perfecting this game.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, in case you can't tell from the title, is a racing game, and the sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. In this game your car transforms into a plane or boat depending on what the course calls for at certain points. As you play the game you earn experience points, and when you level up, you earn a new mod for that character. Mods are changes to how your character's vehicle handles. Because you have to level up each character individually to unlock all the mods for all the characters, it can either be something that adds replay value for you, or be an unfun grind. Aside from the usual grand prix and versus modes, there is a quest mode as well, where you complete challenges to earn stars that allow you to unlock more characters, mods for characters, and of course more challenges. Some of these challenges can be really difficult at times, and to top it off there's also an extra difficulty to unlock that makes these challenges even harder. While the game doesn't have as many power ups or courses to choose from as Mario Kart games have nowadays, the gameplay is solid, and the courses often have multiple paths you can take that act as shortcuts. So far in these Sega All Stars games, I think this one has the best fan service. It's also the best looking and best sounding game in the series. This game is available for multiple platforms, but I recommend getting it on Steam assuming you have the specs to run it, since the Steam version has more exclusive characters than any other version, including an exclusive DLC character.

												wow this game is so fasti first found this game from the ghetto of scandanvia, where i traded this with my only loaf of bread and potatoes, which in our community is a rare delicacy, as our poor local homeless man alexandr gottagofastchovsky starved to death from our lack of foodstarving, malnourished, i opened this game to feast on hedgehog but there it was a completely different experiencei raced in worlds of great variety that faced more turbulence than my ghetto community of scandanavia, and i forgot about the world of hunger and breadbut don't worrymy career mode experience earned me tickets to become a high roller in the resident rich homes of siberia beverly hills with my tony stark transforming cars and mani have my own football manager who cleans my feet and balls (soccer balls in the great land of the west, america) and he provides me more bread and potatoesthis game was so fast that i was transported to greater heights to become a nigerian princess owning various karts of embarrassing, impractical variety, but that's ok because i have transformed into a rich manthanks sonic all stars racing transformedyour gotta go fast made me go past			"

												There are 2 incredibly unique things about this game. 1) It is a AAA Kart-racer on Steam. You aren't gonna find Mario Kart here, so unless you have a console, this is your only chance. 2) It is hard. Mario Kart and other Kart racers can be hard, too, but that is because of rubber-band AI and cheap items. The items in this game all require thought and skill to use and can be avoided with just the same. The AI is very difficult, but that isn't because they go faster as you get ahead, and if that actually puts anyone off, the online experience is also a great time. Also, as apparent from the recent DLC, it is a game that appreciates its online followings. When Mar becomes playable, we would have the perfect game. Minus a few balancing issues (in SP each lap starts the same, even if your main opponent is up front and you're in back) this is a very worth-while game. Even if it wasn't, though, It is a kart racer on Steam and I can play as JSR characters. It had me sold before I even played it.			"

												My karting days go way back to the godfather of karting games Super Mario Kart on the SNES. Having played the majority of clones and spin off games since, it'd be fair to say I'm in a decent position to give a valued and trusted opinion.Aside from perhaps Speed Freaks on the PS1, this is hands down the best Mart Kart clone available today. The added flight and boat modes do not take away the fun or karting aspects of the game and really do enhance the experience. I definately recommend this to anyone who enjoys karting games or arcade style racing in general. Well worth the £14 this game is currently listed as. If your lucky enough to catch it on Steam sale, grab it!			"

												I never thought Mario Kart would ever be topped by another kart racing game. I was wrong. This game completely and utterly blows it out of the water. There are so many things Racing Transformed has that other racers only wish they could brag about. The transforming tracks are the biggest reason and I really hope other developers take notes on this. It does wonders for replay value. Even though the same changes happen every time you play a course, this makes tracks stay entertaining for longer. The vehicle transformations may be what the game advertises, but the courses that transform are by far the best part of the experience. And speaking of vehicles, the transformations are actually handled really well. It takes a bit to adjust to the plane controls at the start but it's easy to get a handle on them after a race or two. The dreaded waterboat controls of most racers don't exist here. There's a lot of drifting, but drifting is easy to pull off and most of all fun.There is of course a grand prix mode for single player, but in addition we are given World Tour mode. You select from a map of challenges that unlock as you complete previous challenges and earn stars depending on the difficulty you complete events. The majority of characters in the game are unlocked by possessing a certain amount of stars, so it is a good idea to go back to old events and try them on a higher difficulty. There are many different kinds of events, and the vast majority of them are legitimately fun. Most racing games that attempt this come off as gimmicky, but there's a lot of fun to be had trying the different events out. The AI is also really well balanced. Easy mode is a cakewalk, Medium gives you more challenge but is generally not that bad, and Hard mode is tough but not impossible. An additional Expert difficulty is unlocked and you'll have to be incredibly skilled at the game to pull off wins there.This game has a very wide selection of characters from Sega history, as well as a few guest characters. The roster is well chosen for the most part. Fans of the first game will miss characters like Jacky/Akira from Virtua Fighter, Opa Opa, Bonanza Bros, Zobio from House of the Dead, and the Chu Chus. Newcomers that make up for those omissions include Nights, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Joe Musashi from Shinobi, and Gilius from Golden Axe. In addition the pc version adds some characters from Sega's franchises on steam. You can play as Football Manager, the Shogun from Total War, Willemus from Troy, and even Team Fortress. Each character can level up with experience gained from racing, and each level unlocks a different mod. These mods tweak the character's stats, and this is a very good feature. For example I really like Gilius, but he has a terrible acceleration stat. I could use his acceleration mod to increase that in exchange for a lower top speed. This opens up a lot of possibilities and lets you play characters you like regardless of their stats. All in all there is a ridiculous amount of fanservice in the game. I do wish they wouldn't have cut some of the old game's cast, but it's hard to complain when the variety of characters is so great. The course selection is varied as well and balanced between many different locations.To summarize, the game has a ton of content and a ridiculous amount of polish to make it one of the best racing games I've ever played. Everything from the mechanics to the fan service to the single player campaign is well done and I'd love to see Sumo try to top this effort.			"

												Basically Mario Kart for the PC, with all the same fun.  The controls are great on an x-box controller and work suprisingly well on just a keyboard if thats all you have.  The only issue ive seen is that some computers will load the game after the race has already began, this seems to happen more with computers with slower harddrives, so occasionally in some races you will start out with a cler handicap if you have an slow harddrive.  This can be mitigated by having the person with the slowest harddrive host the games, but even then i've seen the game load after the game started.			"

												I've just started playing, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way the game tries to expand on th typical four player cart racer scenario. In case anyone is on the fence, this is NOT a Mario Cart type of cash in. The smooth mechanics, interesting visuals, and character balance actually create something incredibly uinique and worthwhile, which is kept fresh by a variety of game modes and complicated stages. I'm looking forward to playing a lot more of this.			"

												PC gets few kart racing games, and its a good thing Sonic and all stars racing transformed is one of the besta fast and exciting game which finds its own identity in a genre dominated by mario kart, your kart can transform into a plane or a boat at certain points during the race spicing up the gameplay, and not only your kart transforms, certain tracks also change during the race, forcing players to adapt quickly if they want to keep the lead, the main complain in the gameplay department id say is the weapons, which while well designed are rarely cheap, are a bit uninspiredthe game features many modes, including world cup, grand prix, time attack, single race and multiple multiplayer modes AND spliscreen multiplayer(!!!), you will definitively get enough bang for your buckthe graphics are also surprisingly good, with a bright and rich color palettecompared to the other versions of the game, PC is arguably the best, it features more characters than any other version and it includes 5 characters exclusive to the PC version, football manager (from the football manager franchise), shogun (from the total war franchise), teamfortress (the spy, pyro and heavy, which count as one racer, from Team Fortress 2), general winter (from the company of heroes franchise) and willemus (also from the total war franchise)the port is for the most part average, with the ocassional graphical glitch which can be fixed by disabling certain special effectoverall, fantastic game, and quite easily one of the most fun steam games ive played			"

												I used to never understand what's the fuzz about this game. It's just a game where sonic drive a car, yet it get a lot of overwhelmingly positive feedback. Then there's a sega sale with 90% price cut, so I think what the heck I might as well get one. And the experience? is amazing!Despite the fact this game were released under the seventh generation of console, it has a great graphic. Running smoothly 1080p 60fps on my steam link. Heck, I can even run this game on my 2006 Core 2 Duo with medium setting and a decent fps. Works great with my F710 without a problem at all. The tracks are amazing! and Ryo Hazuki is still the best thing about this game.10/10 would ride a bike over a boat!			"

												Graphics: 9/10Sound: 9/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Value: 9.5/10Total: 9.25/10Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is one of the best racing games I've ever played.  Unfortunately the multiplayer is pretty dead these days.  I got this game when purchasing the Sega Collection for a very nice deal a couple years ago.  Being hopelessly bored one day, I decided to try the game out.  I was not disappointed.I recently played Mario Kart 8 for the first time on a friends Wii-U.  Sonic racing was easily better.  The game can be a real challenge sometimes.  The scenery is amazing throughout the levels as well.  I found myself playing the crap out of this game until I'd pretty much gotten every achievement besides the multiplayer ones.If you can find this game cheap and don't mind single player racing, this game will take you for a wild ride that you will not soon forget!

												We all grew up playing the Mario Kart games.  I remember playing split-screen on the Super Nintendo while others may have gotten their first taste with Mario Cart 64 or Double-Dash.  Its a fun twist on the racing genre and Sonic was long overdue for a spot in the limelight.  That is not to say to this is Sonic's first racing experience but its easily one of his best; it finally puts him on par with his rival.  A ton of different characters and tracks along with superb vehicle handling make this is a top-notch racing game.Game play is key to any racing game and this one is exceptionally smooth.  This game is quite unique in the fact that you race across land, water, and in the sky.  Thankfully, the vehicles handle smoothly across all three modes.  The drifting is very satisfying and is quite easy once you get used to how it feels.  You'll be drifting a lot as you'll get a boost that varies in strength depending on the length of your drift.  If you need some assist there is an array of different power-ups at your disposal.  These range from homing RC drones, to big fat blow-fish, to snow balls.The content in this game, especially in the career mode, is quite astonishing.  First and foremost almost everything can be played via couch co-op which is a rare find these days.  The career will have you compete not only in races but various challenges such as races that require you to constantly drift or races that require you to meet checkpoints while avoiding traffic.  The easier difficulties will make this game fairly accessible while the hard difficulties can be quite challenging.  All the game modes will reward your character with experience points for finishing racing.  These will unlock different mods you can use to change the stats on your vehicles.Sonic is one of a dozen or so IPs represented in this game.  There is a bunch of characters from the Sonic universe including Tails, Knuckles, Amy, and Shadow.  You'll find them racing along the likes of Beat ( Jet Set Radio), Ulala (Space Channel 5), Aiai (Super Monkey Ball), Amigo (Samba De Amigo), Ralph (Wreck it Ralph), and many more.  You'll race across multiple tracks that represent just as many different games.  The character models look just as good as the tracks which are brimming with personality.  Some tracks feature each vehicle mode evenly while others focus one or two more than the others.  Almost all the tracks change each lap giving each race an exciting cinematic feel.Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is a successful modern twist on the classic kart racer genre.  The races are fast and frantic.  You'll feel great as you pull off tight drifts or knock out opponents sneaking up behind you.  There is a wonderful variety of much loved characters and locations featured in this game.  Bring a friend over to enjoy the robust co-op that is accessible across almost the entire game.  No matter how you play it or who you play as you're bound to have a great time playing this game.			"

												This game presents a time and space anomaly of disastrous proportions. If this is not addressed soon, I fear the SEGAverse may collapse in on itself and create a singularity impact that will swallow the third dimension. Not only should it be physically improbable that a russian general can enter a kart race with a tank to race against an anime sky pirate, but the fact that there is a kart racer that could be argued to be as good or possibly better than Mario Kart means that we may have possibly experienced twist in the time lines that has given us a Sonic the Hedgehog kart racer that is not terrible.I will attempt to do more research into the subject, but in brief, my theory is that All-Stars Racing may possibly be a good video game that you would wish to purchase. I will report back when I have received more in-depth results following further testing.			"

The maps are well designed, the drifting is fun. Its a solid racing game that gives MK a run for its money. My only gripe is the boat segments. They're still fun, but less so than the rest of the race. Regardless of who you're playing as, the boat can be a pain to control due to the random air-time you get with the ebb and flow of waves.

												A true kart racer that holds it's own against the likes of Mario Kart Double Dash and Crash Team Racing, ASRT takes the genre in a whole new vivid direction while providing one of the greatest bundles of nostalgia to grace the world, vastly improving over the original ASR in every possible way. Stunning reimagined environments, more creative weapon combos, swift transformations with extensive playtime for each mode, a lively soundtrack that brings out the magic of the original music, and a true all-star cast that are further bolstered by the PC version's benefits make for one of the most definitive racing games on the market and an open love letter recommendation to any SEGA fan.Of further note is that ASRT PC runs more stable and overall better than the original ASR PC, on a chuggy system that just about manages with Team Fortress 2 and Sonic Generations. Truly a lovingly optimized PC port.			"

												At first, everyone was making fun of Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing because it looked like a Mario Kart rip-off. Now, because of the three vehicule types gameplay, people are comparing it to Diddy Kong Racing. Compare this game as much as you want, it's still one of the greatest arcade racing game of the past 10 years and also one of the best kart racers of all time. With an all-star cast featuring characters from the Sonic franchise, underground franchises like Jet Set Radio and Super Monkey Ball and characters from other games such as the crew from Team Fortress 2 and General Winter from Company Of Heroes 2, this game is an absolute blast. The team behind this game is composed of many members from other developers who made games such as Project Gotham Racing, Blur and Split/Second. It's an amazing game, packed with alot of tracks, missions, a career mode that is awesome and the replay value is sky high. An absolute must for anyone who likes racing, Sonic or SEGA in general.

												If anyone of you has ever played Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing and liked it - you'll definitely love this one and I can guarantee that!While you keep playing, you can unlock 26 characters in total and you have lots of different kind of levels to play through! When other racing games go only by bikes and go-karts, in S&ASRT you can drive cars, bikes, boats and planes as soon as the environment changes.The game itself is not different from other racing games but it gives you an energic boost when you get into it - all the maps, views, the way the environment goes crazy and the soundtracks. You just can't do anything else but to love it!			"

												This game is a cart racer similar to Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing. This game is pretty fun the way stages will change based on whatever lap you're on. The ground can shatter, the road can end going into an ocean... or you can launch off an air carrier and race in the middle of a massive dog fight.. it all depends on the stage. The changes are scripted and are the same each time but still it adds a fun dynamic to what otherwise would have been a standard kart racing game. Your kart can transform into a speed boat or a flying machine depending on what happens in the game. Winning is based more on how well you can handle your vehicle and how well you can drift-boost. You can also dodge attacks with speed boost making the game more skill based than luck based. Being farther in the back makes the chance of getting a greater item higher. Being in front however doesn't mean you'll be denied ultimate attacks. You have a chance of getting your ultimate ""All-Star"" item even in first place. This game really did keep my attention for quite a while. I put about 30 hours into it playing the Grand Prix mode in easy, normal hard and expert. Trust me when I say this. ""Normal"" is the old Sonic Racing ""Hard mode"" Hard and expert mode will give you a run for your money. There is also a progression mode to earn stars and unlock characters and mods. They get very difficult if not impossible towards the end so proceed with caution. This game is a total retro throwback to many of old segas games so many of the themes in the game have been remixed or improved upon with the exception of old stages from the previous Sonic Racing. My favorite themes in the game are the theme for Burning Depths and the theme for the Golden Axe level. Overall this game is not too bad. Great visuals, nice background music, fun characters. It's a must have for any sonic fan and a 'try' for anyone who remotely likes cart racers. I'm sure you'll get at least some fun out of it. At launch the game released with a online multiplayer mode that was extremely broken and near impossible to play with constant disconnects, empty lobbies and lag to no end. I recently played it again. Match making has been improved but the load times are ridiculous, taking anywhere from 2-3 minutes to load a stage with 10 players. Online Multiplayer is still very laggy causing characters to jump back and forth in time because players aren't synced. Sumo and Sega failed on the one thing that could have made this a game awesome. End the end I'm still disappointed.   "

												Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed is, aside from the lengthy name, possibly the most fun I've had in any racing game so far, and despite it being at least somewhat inspired by Mario Kart it still feels original. From what I've seen so far the community is extremely friendly which is always nice to see and just under 2 years later there are groups still activley playing this game every day. It's packed with charming graphics, incredible track/level design and a soundtrack that feels both fresh and nostalgic. It's also full of replay value and if you ever feel like you're becoming uninterested; just watch a track speedrun on YouTube and before you know it you'll have logged another 3 hours on the game.Final score: ★★★★☆ (4/5)			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.It also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.It also had a ""bonus edition"" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.Multiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.Eh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.I think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.Original Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.Transformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.And well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.Transforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.And well, that's why you need a gamepad.Sea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.Air section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.Weapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.But we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?No, it doesn't.BUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!AND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!I am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.And yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR. And I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.Anyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!Just a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.Stages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.But really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!			"

Posted: December 16, 2014
												Got this from the humble Sega bundle recently, originally for (hoping for, and later on became true) Sonic Generations. I have always liked racing games in general and the Mario Kart series. I went into this game not expecting much... boy was I wrong.Being honest, at first, I couldn't see how this game was good despite hearing that it was. The drifting felt strange as a Mario Kart player. The speed boosts obtained didn't seem very significant. I couldn't beat the 2nd hardest difficulty for my first session or so in the game... and this was early on in the ""world tour"" mode.Then, I tried time attack for the first time. I was initially disappointed by how you were only able to do one of the three laps in a normal race; I wanted to run the full 3 laps. However, in the end, I've come to accept it as okay.Anyway, I saw one of the top ghosts going unbelievably fast (to this very moment, I feel mostly certain about it being a cheat of sorts). So I tried getting better. After easily beating the ""medium"" ghost, I saw the hard ghost as my goal. After some struggling, I beat that, and... an expert ghost comes out. While not nearly as fast as the top lap times, I could not keep up.The game had more things for me to learn than I thought. On top of track layout, there are things like: Switching drift direction mid-chain. Air tricks. Transform boosts. Utilizing the small hops in the terrain/water as a car/boat for an extra trick, while drifting. Risk boosts in a plane. Boost levels beyond the stated 3 from drifting. Using a boost/drift boost to evade the remote control item. Holding drifts or not drifting on certain parts of tracks for more speed than if I let go of a boost. Being able to drift while not holding the accelerator to make tighter turns. Those are the things I learned in my 28 hours according to steam, 20 hours in game time ""journey"". In that order as well.As a fan of racing and going fast, all this was a grand learning experience. The tracks are very good overall; I loved how each lap could (and usually are) a different experience. It's a shame they even brought back 4 old tracks (20 total) from the previous iteration of this game where there's only a car section. Those are by far my least favorite tracks, since they feel so bland and boring.It's also a shame there are only 20 tracks too (1 more if you count DLC I believe). (No I don't count mirror versions). The 16 tracks that nearly all change each lap are amazing to go through the first time. Then, after learning all their intricate details, maximizing your speed in each is great fun. They are all beautiful and fairly colorful. I want more; double that. Sumo entertainment (makers of this game) can make great tracks.That doesn't even touch on the actual game experience as a whole. World Tour, the ""main"" mode features a variety of race types to help get you to understand the game's mechanics. From regular races with items, boost-only races, shooting at a tank, and dumbed down time attack ghosts, there's a lot to go through. You don't even unlock the ability to do the hardest difficulty until you complete most of the mode in the first place. This is a mostly good thing to me at least. I definitely would not have had any chance of winning had I not learned from struggling with the 2nd hardest difficulty.You unlock nearly all characters from World Tour mode as well. For a grand total of 23 (no DLC), each feels similar enough as a whole, but each one really does have slightly different characteristics... even if 2 characters stats are the same. As you use each character, they can ""level up"" to obtain mods, which alter their stats a bit. The best ones, especially when you play the game seriously, are locked behind obtaining the max level and/or progressing in World Tour though. You likely won't set great time attack records without them. This is a mostly good thing, but I feel the unlocks for the best mods should not always have been last.Then there's your standard grand prix mode. Since I completed the vast majority of world tour on the hardest difficulty before touching grand prix, grand prix wasn't so bad. However, the computers definitely cheat. You cannot outrun them no matter how fast you are versus the world. They also will throw items at you at bad times in most cases. A lot of the time, you will have to shoot the cpu ahead of you just before crossing the finish line to obtain first place. Mercifully, the AI does seem to have leeway on which one is ""fast"" for the race, so you can still take 1st overall if you just race well.Speaking of items, they're very standard and a lot less powerful than in other games of this type (...well, Mario Kart series). They work in a close/relatively close race, but if one gets far enough ahead, hardly any items will be able to stop  a player from racing as well as they can. Great in single player (not that you'll ever be able to utilize that since they cheat), but multiplayer kind of suffers from it.Multiplayer has some players, but not much. It's not the most fleshed out option. It's also an older game now, so that's expected. It's kind of a slow process overall, but the races run more smoothly than expected even if someone else has a seemingly worse connection. Sadly, the largest race I've been in only consisted of about 6 players. I got into a lobby that was full, only to have the game crash before the race started. While it was fun, it doesn't have much longevity. Now that I am proficient at all tracks, skill/track knowledge makes a rather large difference in how well you do online. As mentioned previously, only a couple items, if that, can affect a far-ahead front runner. With a large enough lead, the leader will most likely keep extending it if racers behind don't have the skill to keep/catch up.The only truly negative aspect of this game, if that, would be some silly achievements. Having 4 people play locally is out of the question, given the lack of controllers/keyboards/usb ports. Investing more money just for that would be silly. Then there's luck based things, like hitting from a long distance. I wish to 100% achievement the game (as I've 101% completed the game), but they really add nothing to the experience.Overall, for how cheap I personally got this game, it's a great purchase with enough surface allure and depth to keep you playing, should you choose to get into it. I would definitely have paid a bit more for it (I'm a cheap gamer nowadays). It's a somewhat old game now, but it's definitely worth your time to check out if you're a fan of racing.			"

												Most likely the best kart racer released recently. It definitely beats the recent Mario Karts. The courses are more entertaining and the items are most certainly more balanced than any recent Mario Kart offerings. The multiplayer is solid and the game is slightly more skill based than other similiar Kart games. The fact that the courses utilize kart, boat and plane sections keep the experience fresh.Some of the characters may not be as iconic as Nintendo's stable of racers, but there are more than plenty to choose from.

												Love this game... My wife and I race each other each night (she usually kicks my butt) on the PS3 - we love playing battle race mode against each other.The Steam PC version has even more racers. Works absolutely perfectly with my XBox 360 controller hooked up.Multiple race modes, about 20 great tracks [huge variety + additional mirrored tracks can be unlocked too]. Very fast paced, and nice long tracks. Big variety of land/sea/air areas on most of the tracks, and some laps will change path patterns so it keeps you on your toes.It may be an older game, but it's still one of my favorites. Love the variety of race characters that span across so many games. I highly recommend Sonic Transformed All Star Racing for anyone looking for some comical fun racing, either single or multiplayer. Definite thumbs up! :o)			"

												Coming from a long history of playing Mario Kart, this game is refreshingly similar but includes some distinctive features. For once, AI don't finish in the same order in every damn race. Then there is the career mode (one by one vs. cups of 4) and the unlocking through progress. Last but not least there are similarities such as drifting (snake technique?).The biggest feature - the transformation into ships and planes - goes along with a change in physics and balancing which is great.Overall, the single player is much less frustrating than expected. There are so many different race modes! Time Attacks, Ring Races, Drift Challenges, Speed Challenges, races without weapons... From what I can see, this is the best Mario Kart availalble for PC and it might even beat it on any platform because of the track variety and different race modes.			"

You  drive one  water  with  your transformed  car  to waterboat or  you  fly in the  air  with your transformed car  to airplan. If  you  like Mario Kart  and  you  are  a Sega  fan than  check it  out  that  game.			"

												This is such a unique racing experience with some pretty awesome characters. It is very fast paced, and doesn't contain just straight races throughout the campaign. The campaign is filled with other types of races and time trial-type races, which make the game more interesting. The tracks are amazing, changing their structure after each lap. The transformation aspect of this game is very unique and pulled off very well. This is a great racing game.			"

												I mentally associate Sonic games in this era to be sub-standard reproductions of the Sega heyday of the 1990's which pander to widespread nostalgia. But this game is really good. Like, as good as the modern iteration of Mario Kart good. The environmental graphics and animations in particular are phenomenal and transition from ground to air chases is seamless and thrilling. There's a huge number of characters are available and a lot of them are weird, but hey, this is made by Japan. Another odd feature of this game is that the interface is narrated: select anything and it will speak what you selected aloud, as if it was made for blind people. Sonic All-Stars Racing is filled with quirks but is a lot of fun where it counts: the thrill of racing, especially with friends in local multiplayer.			"

												Coming from a long history of playing Mario Kart, this game is refreshingly similar but includes some distinctive features. For once, AI don't finish in the same order in every damn race. Then there is the career mode (one by one vs. cups of 4) and the unlocking through progress. Last but not least there are similarities such as drifting (snake technique?).The biggest feature - the transformation into ships and planes - goes along with a change in physics and balancing which is great.Overall, the single player is much less frustrating than expected. There are so many different race modes! Time Attacks, Ring Races, Drift Challenges, Speed Challenges, races without weapons... From what I can see, this is the best Mario Kart availalble for PC and it might even beat it on any platform because of the track variety and different race modes.			"

												It's the closest thing to playing Mario Kart on a PC and it has enough bells and whistles to make it an excellent game in its own right. SEGA has a rich history and they have transformed that into a heap of excellent stages. Level design is inspired, with many a stage transforming throughout the race - the final lap is often very different to the first lap. Performance on my PC was excellent. I played in at 4k @ 60 fps using a GTX980. Never experienced any slowdown. An easy recommend for anyone who enjoys cart racing games. I'd be shocked if anyone who loved Mario Kart didn't also have a heap of fun playing this game.			"

												This game is immensely fun! ...but make sure you have a graphics chip that meets the reccomended requirements, and plenty of system RAM too--ideally 4GB or more total. Else you will run into slow loading times, and graphical glitches, some of which make parts of the game unplayable. I know because I have experienced it myself, unfortunately for me I cannot afford a better computer right now. DRIVING, BOATING, PILOTING--all on the same, track? Lots of powerups, shortcuts, tricks, modes, characters, locations. It will take you a long time to complete everything! ONLINE PLAY! This is the closest the PC has gotten to Mario Kart, need I say more?			"

												Easily one of, if not the best, kart racers I've ever played. The game is a huge love letter to Sega and its various franchises, with characters and stages from games like Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, Skies of Arcadia, and many more. Even if you don't have any love for Sega, though, it's still worth picking this game up. The tracks are all huge and well-designed, with each lap changing the course in some way. The transformation gimmick works out really well and makes the tracks that much more interesting. It's also incredibly well balanced. All of the racers feel unique enough for you to find somebody you like, and none of the items are overly dickish. They're all dodgeable, and the game rewards you for dealing with them effectively. The only close equivalent to the blue shell is 100% dodgeable, and in fact is easy to dodge. The game is just overall an incredibly fun and enjoyable experience, and it's super well optimized for PC. It's worth basically whatever price people ask for it.I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like Kart racers and/or Sega at all, you owe it to yourself to try this amazing game.			"

												I think it's safe to say that this is the best cart game out there and in my opinion the best multiplayer racing game on pc. A variety of players to choose, amazing nintendo-inspired beautiful tracks, three-types of racing in the same game (basically beating the **** out of games based only on that gameplay). You honestly can't ask more from a game of this type. I should also mention that this is a perfect port with no problems like many other games and any gamepad is compatable (no pressure to buy the most expensive gamepad). This will give maany hours of fun and I recommend getting a four-pack whenever you can.			"

												This game is a must-have for any racing fanatic. While many may think ""Oh it's just a Mario Kart rip-off"", I am here to tell you that this game is so much more behind it's similarity to Mario Kart.If you care to look closer to gameplay of this game and Mario Kart, you'd see that this game is a LOT more skill-related than it is 'shoot-your-way-to-1st-place', which (sorry, Nintendo) is what Mario Kart mainly is. In Mario Kart, if you don't get to first place very early on, you are kinda screwed, unless you happen to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Red Shells. Also, the A.I. is kinda mediocre.In this game, however, since there are 3 different types of vehicles, there are 3 different playstyles, which also means that there are 3 different opportunites to get an edge over your opponent(s). One can be horrible at driving boats while they excell at piloting airplanes, which can be their ticket to the podium or, alternatively, their ticket to the back of the line. Unfortunately, (sorry, getting off-topic here) you cannot gain a 'rivalry' with another character, which makes them try and ram you off the course or target you if you are nearby. This would make the game pretty awesome and a lot more player-influenced. In addition to this game's unique playstyle, there are also some very unique mission types, such as Pursuit, in which you have a health bar and you must destroy a tank with missiles, which is not something you'd expect from SEGA. Just fullof suprises, now, aren't you?Overall, I give this game an 8.7/10, because there are some glitches present that can cause you to come in last (such as hitting a ramp in boat mode and falling out of the track. You do respawn, however, so it is not a major thing) and because some missions are outright ridiculous in their difficulty. Other than these flaws, this game is great all around.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys their classic racing games with a little... twist added to them. (Also because no one has this game and I want to race my friends ;~;)			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.It also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.It also had a ""bonus edition"" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.Multiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.Eh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.I think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.Original Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.Transformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.And well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.Transforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.And well, that's why you need a gamepad.Sea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.Air section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.Weapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.But we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?No, it doesn't.BUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!AND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!I am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.And yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR. And I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.Anyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!Just a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.Stages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.But really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!			"

												Got this from the humble Sega bundle recently, originally for (hoping for, and later on became true) Sonic Generations. I have always liked racing games in general and the Mario Kart series. I went into this game not expecting much... boy was I wrong.Being honest, at first, I couldn't see how this game was good despite hearing that it was. The drifting felt strange as a Mario Kart player. The speed boosts obtained didn't seem very significant. I couldn't beat the 2nd hardest difficulty for my first session or so in the game... and this was early on in the ""world tour"" mode.Then, I tried time attack for the first time. I was initially disappointed by how you were only able to do one of the three laps in a normal race; I wanted to run the full 3 laps. However, in the end, I've come to accept it as okay.Anyway, I saw one of the top ghosts going unbelievably fast (to this very moment, I feel mostly certain about it being a cheat of sorts). So I tried getting better. After easily beating the ""medium"" ghost, I saw the hard ghost as my goal. After some struggling, I beat that, and... an expert ghost comes out. While not nearly as fast as the top lap times, I could not keep up.The game had more things for me to learn than I thought. On top of track layout, there are things like: Switching drift direction mid-chain. Air tricks. Transform boosts. Utilizing the small hops in the terrain/water as a car/boat for an extra trick, while drifting. Risk boosts in a plane. Boost levels beyond the stated 3 from drifting. Using a boost/drift boost to evade the remote control item. Holding drifts or not drifting on certain parts of tracks for more speed than if I let go of a boost. Being able to drift while not holding the accelerator to make tighter turns. Those are the things I learned in my 28 hours according to steam, 20 hours in game time ""journey"". In that order as well.As a fan of racing and going fast, all this was a grand learning experience. The tracks are very good overall; I loved how each lap could (and usually are) a different experience. It's a shame they even brought back 4 old tracks (20 total) from the previous iteration of this game where there's only a car section. Those are by far my least favorite tracks, since they feel so bland and boring.It's also a shame there are only 20 tracks too (1 more if you count DLC I believe). (No I don't count mirror versions). The 16 tracks that nearly all change each lap are amazing to go through the first time. Then, after learning all their intricate details, maximizing your speed in each is great fun. They are all beautiful and fairly colorful. I want more; double that. Sumo entertainment (makers of this game) can make great tracks.That doesn't even touch on the actual game experience as a whole. World Tour, the ""main"" mode features a variety of race types to help get you to understand the game's mechanics. From regular races with items, boost-only races, shooting at a tank, and dumbed down time attack ghosts, there's a lot to go through. You don't even unlock the ability to do the hardest difficulty until you complete most of the mode in the first place. This is a mostly good thing to me at least. I definitely would not have had any chance of winning had I not learned from struggling with the 2nd hardest difficulty.You unlock nearly all characters from World Tour mode as well. For a grand total of 23 (no DLC), each feels similar enough as a whole, but each one really does have slightly different characteristics... even if 2 characters stats are the same. As you use each character, they can ""level up"" to obtain mods, which alter their stats a bit. The best ones, especially when you play the game seriously, are locked behind obtaining the max level and/or progressing in World Tour though. You likely won't set great time attack records without them. This is a mostly good thing, but I feel the unlocks for the best mods should not always have been last.Then there's your standard grand prix mode. Since I completed the vast majority of world tour on the hardest difficulty before touching grand prix, grand prix wasn't so bad. However, the computers definitely cheat. You cannot outrun them no matter how fast you are versus the world. They also will throw items at you at bad times in most cases. A lot of the time, you will have to shoot the cpu ahead of you just before crossing the finish line to obtain first place. Mercifully, the AI does seem to have leeway on which one is ""fast"" for the race, so you can still take 1st overall if you just race well.Speaking of items, they're very standard and a lot less powerful than in other games of this type (...well, Mario Kart series). They work in a close/relatively close race, but if one gets far enough ahead, hardly any items will be able to stop  a player from racing as well as they can. Great in single player (not that you'll ever be able to utilize that since they cheat), but multiplayer kind of suffers from it.Multiplayer has some players, but not much. It's not the most fleshed out option. It's also an older game now, so that's expected. It's kind of a slow process overall, but the races run more smoothly than expected even if someone else has a seemingly worse connection. Sadly, the largest race I've been in only consisted of about 6 players. I got into a lobby that was full, only to have the game crash before the race started. While it was fun, it doesn't have much longevity. Now that I am proficient at all tracks, skill/track knowledge makes a rather large difference in how well you do online. As mentioned previously, only a couple items, if that, can affect a far-ahead front runner. With a large enough lead, the leader will most likely keep extending it if racers behind don't have the skill to keep/catch up.The only truly negative aspect of this game, if that, would be some silly achievements. Having 4 people play locally is out of the question, given the lack of controllers/keyboards/usb ports. Investing more money just for that would be silly. Then there's luck based things, like hitting from a long distance. I wish to 100% achievement the game (as I've 101% completed the game), but they really add nothing to the experience.Overall, for how cheap I personally got this game, it's a great purchase with enough surface allure and depth to keep you playing, should you choose to get into it. I would definitely have paid a bit more for it (I'm a cheap gamer nowadays). It's a somewhat old game now, but it's definitely worth your time to check out if you're a fan of racing.			"

												You might take one look at Sonic & ALL-Stars Racing Transformed and see it as a Mario Kart knock off. While they are similar, I would say this game borrows more elements from Diddy Kong Racing on the N64. Both these games feature hovercrafts, airplanes, and karts. The difference with this title is that the vehicles transform between all of these within each course. And might I add that the courses look spectacular! Not only that, but they are actually really well designed. Each course is filled with nods of nostalgia if you ever owned a Master System, Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast, or any Sega game. The music is brilliantly catchy consisting of remixed SEGA tunes from previous catalogs. It's obviously not Mario Kart and lacks the eggshells, invincibility stars, The Mushroom Kingdom, etc. This is SEGA so it's all Sonic galore. Thankfully, this game isn't based soley on characters from the Sonic universe and most of the disliked characters from the series are NOT included. In return, this game mixes characters from other Sega games such as NiGHTs, Alex Kidd, and Beat from Jet Set Radio. Most of the included characters aren't even popular Sega characters, but the fact they have been included is total fan service. Surprisingly, this game is actually fun and REALLY REALLY fast. It's both addictive and challenging with tons of unlockables. And it sports online play with voice communication! Sadly, most will compare this to Mario Kart and shove it off as knock off. The reality is that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed actually gives Mario Kart a run for it's money. Thus, it's sort of like picking between apples and oranges and in this case, it just becomes a Sega does what NintenDONT. (Just had to say it.)In conclusion, this is one of the best Sega games I've played in recent years. Go figure it was made by Sumo Digital, a second party studio outside of SEGA. In theory, maybe Sega should hire them more often. Anyway, despite the brilliance of this kart racer it does have a few flaws. It certainly lacks that Nintendo polish you see in the Mario Kart series. There are a couple of nasty bugs (mostly in online mode) that do appear out of no where. A patch could really do this game well. Other than that, I'd say it's almost comparable to Mario Kart, maybe some aspects even better than Mario Kart. This game is a perfect solution for those who don't own a Nintendo Platform, but are desperately craving a kart racer, and a good one at that! If you own a Wii U, this is the game you bought while you waited for Mario Kart 8. Some have even argued that Nintendo should have borrowed some elements from Transformed. Transformed is better than nothing, but it's even better if you are a fan of Sega and familar with their back catalog of games.  In short, it's Diddy Kong Racing on steroids, but with Sonic and Sega characters instead. It even has a couple of monkeys from the Super Monkey ball games...that's close enough to Diddy. Don't be fooled by Sega's mediocrity of the past. This game belongs in the top 5 kart racers list. Right up there Crash Team Racing, Diddy Kong Racing, and Mario Kart.OVERALL:+ Good visuals, catchy tunes, fun gameplay-  A few nasty bugs-  Hovercraft can be hard to control. (No different to DKR on N64)			"

												I'll go ahead and say it: it's the Steam equivalent of a Mario Kart game. Even so, there's enough different about it to set it apart from the tried-and-true formula it's based on. The transformations can be pretty cool to see. The tracks change as you progress through the race, so you may start on the ground, but end in the air. Admittedly, there's a certain excitement to seeing the course crumble around you while you narrowly dodge the projectiles your opponents are spewing. There are plenty of modes and unlockables to keep you occupied for a while, so consider giving it a chance if you like kart racers.			"

												Fun (but often frustrating) racing game. There's your traditional racing mode (more on that below), and the standard arena modes you'd find in most modern racing games, plus capture the flag. The story mode, involving unlocking tracks via gated progression based off of how well you perform in previous races, can be enormously frustrating at times. There are four difficulty settings for each track: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert (which only unlocks after you've beaten the tracks on an easier difficulty first) and each present their own spin on AI. Easy is pretty much a cakewalk, and anyone familiar with the controls should be able to fly through each race. The others, though, are a different story.The AI cheats in this game. A LOT. They are completely shameless about it. Every race, you start dead last in 10th place far behind everyone else, and half of the AI get boost starts on top of that. If you manage to overcome that massive handicap, you'll also have to deal with conspiring AI (they will always opt to fire their skills at you instead of other AI if possible), immediate & flawless reaction times, and to top it all off, one bot each race will basically be Wonder Woman. They're substantially harder, faster, better, stronger than all the other bots. Beating this game on Hard boils down to first managing to fly past the other 8 bots without any of them ever getting a good ability hit on you (if you do, you might as well restart the race) and then duking it out with the Alpha bot of the pack and hope that you get All Star before he/she does. I haven't even tried to get past the first race of the first zone on Expert -- the bots will utilize every map exploit, corner trick, and power-up to completely ♥♥♥♥ you over. I'm sticking to my theory that this is a difficulty reserved for the sole purpose of derisively taunting your racing skills. Overall impressions: It might be worth a pickup at $20 if you enjoy racing games. At $5, it's probably worth getting just for the menagerie of characters. Just be prepared for your robot overlords.

												It's probably one of the better arcade racers I've played in recent years. I should get to playing it more but I have to be in the right kind of mood to want this kind of game. The game itself is easy to pick up and play but challenging to master. I'd recommend this over the various Mario Kart racers thanks to the competitive aspect that lies somewhat hidden beneath the surface. Not all of the tracks are perfect but most of them are easy on the eyes and varied in a way that one track can have multiple ""environments"" thanks to the different vehicle modes of going from car to airplane to boat. This is my favorite game released from SEGA since Sonic Generations. The learning curve is very good going from lower difficulties up to harder ones and earning those medals prolongs replay ability if you're into that sort of collecting. 10 player online racing also insures that when you're tired of predictability in the racing AI you'll have slightly more unpredictable opponents to go up against. I can't speak from personal experience on that aspect because I've played the game so little and have no confidence in doing well against live opponents. It's like what my old pal Han said, ""Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living? That's something else."" However, I hear numerous reports that the online does work well with only minor latency issues and almost no disconnects. I would like to note that it may be harder to find as many opponents to race on the PC version with the exception of occasional sales that pop up like right now for example.I've heard some say it was ported badly or botched somehow. I never once experienced any issues with this game regarding graphical or control issues though I do use a Sixaxis controller and cannot speak for racing with mouse + keyboard. From my experience you're just asking for trouble when you play racing or fighting games without a gamepad but that's my opinion. It's one of the most stable games I've played in regards to alt+tabbing in and out of with no issues though results may vary depending on your OS.WARNING: The following huge paragraph is basically me attempting to explain and justify why I prefer video game music that sounds ""video game in nature"". Feel free to skip to the paragraph below it if you don't want to read a bunch of my most likely incoherent thoughts.I have to be honest here. I'm not easily impressed by music in most modern games. Usually we end up with some orchestral pieces or stuff that just sounds very unfitting to a video game soundtrack if that make sense. There was a time when you heard video game music and it was instantly recognizable as such mostly because of limitations of the sound chip included in a console/pc engine. For instance, if you never played Mario Galaxy and then listened to most of the OST you would probably assume it was just a piece made by some contemporary orchestra. So I think what SEGA does right in their Sonic games is they include music that sounds very true to what a video game soundtrack used to sound like, except it has been updated with present day technology using instruments and other more advanced techniques and sounds they couldn't have use in the past due to the limitations I mentioned before. I want to re-implore you all that I am in no way suggesting that video game music should never be orchestral or push the limit on what you can use in a video game, I only suggest what I prefer. Maybe I'm biased in that I have nostalgia for those old distinct sounds and I should just get over it and get into the orchestral stuff so I can further my taste. All I know is, some music I hear in video games travels into my auditory system and my brain says to me ""Yes I like this please continue."" I'm not here to say video game music should be a certain way, I know that any music in a video game is automatically ""video game music"" and therefore I can't deny any music used in any video game, even something like CRAZY BUS, is not video game music. All I'm saying is that there is a distinct difference in how video game music is being treated across various mediums and I prefer the route that Sega has taken when compared to say Nintendo and the developers who publish games for Xbox and Playstation. Also, I do want to say that orchestral music does have a place in video games. Let's take Shadow of the Colossus for example on the PS2. This game was definitely something  you played rather than watched yet it's movie-like quality lead to the orchestral score being one of the most fitting elements included. You had these tremendous sounds with drums, violins going to town, flutes and other wind organs just accentuating the excitement. Or at quieter less exciting times they were played slowly and solemnly to convey that feeling of loneliness or majesty of these colossi and the forbidden land that cradled them. So again, it has its place but should this music be everywhere? My opinion is that no it should not. The music should compliment what is happening and meld in some way that it fits appropriately to the style and events taking place.So now that we got that out of the way I want to say that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has one of the better soundtracks I've heard as of late. It reminds me of that electronic sound present in many older games and very much suits the fast pace racing game play. A lot of it is remixes but with enough twists that I feel they are their own creation with sampling rather than just simple tweaks and added effects. So I can safely say the music is more than solid, I really like it. If you like the music in older sonic games I am confident you will like it as well.Looking back at how much I've written thus far I think it's time to stop because no one will want to finish my ""little"" reccomendation. I think this game is worth a try for just about anyone with the slightest interest in it. I do have to admit the boundaries aren't perfect where often times I think that I can get away with just barely missing the edge of some obstacle or guard rail, and then suddenly I hit a tiny piece of invisible obstacle that was jutting out  just barely. However, this isn't a racing sim so such things are to be expected but still hurt my enjoyment if only slightly. I'd say it's worth the $5 it's on sale for right now but I paid $15 for it awhile ago and I'm still pleased with what I got for my money.			"

The roster of characters are from a variety of different games and movies, which makes it even more fun for my kids to play as these racing heroes.

												Very fun kart racing game. The single player is pretty fun, but playing muliplayer with your friends is awesome. There are 30 different characters in game, in with a different standard style of driving. Each racer has 6 skills - Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, and All-Star. As you level up your racers you unlock mods which change how those skills are spread out. The different tracks and gamemodes can call for a different setup, so you can usually use your favorite racer with a different mod. (And of course Football Manager is the best racer :D )The tracks are based on old Sega game, and most of them change throughout the 3 laps. There are also sections where you transform into a boat or a plane. There are a few different game modes - SP has a World Tour, a Grand Prix, and single race modes. For MP there are:Standard Race - Race for the top position while utilizing power ups.Battle Arena - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Battle Race - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Capture The Chao - A Chao balloon and a capture point spawn in random spots. Bringing the Chao balloon to the capture point adds to the players score. Reaching the target limit or capturing the most before time runs out declares the winner.Boost Race - Race for the top position. There are no items to make use of, only boost pads will help racers in this mode.The boost race isn't that much fun, as using powerups to slow or stun your opponents is the best part of playing a kart game.  The other modes are all very fun though. This is definitely worth picking up during a Steam sale, and if you like kart or racing games $20 isn't bad either.			"

												This is definitely the greatest kart racer ever on PC, as the track designs are amazing where some tracks actually transform in terms of gameplay and visual while the vehicles in the game are a joy to drive with incredible depth in its handling. Gameplay wise, it is an incredibly fun racing game.However, if you are a completionist or just someone who is looking for a genuinely difficult racing game, this is for you too, as this game can be really difficult to beat at high difficulty which also offer a lot of replayibility. The AI in this game does not cheat as obvious as other racing games, wthout using cheap tactics like rubber band AI, that brings to the fact that this game encourage skilled gameplay that does not present in other racing games.

												Definitely one of the most amusing and amazing racing games I have seen in some time.Playing as one of many SEGA characters (or guests such as the TF2 Crew and Ralph), you take to a highly detailed and very fluid racetrack and race your opponents to the finish. The tracks transform and give way to water or open skies, and your vehicle will transform between car/boat/plane to adjust to the changes.I would say the positive points of this game come from the smoothness of the racing experience, and the rewarding feeling that comes from mastering a race course or passing a particular challenge. The campaign mode tests your abilities in race types varying from normal Races to Drift Challenges, Traffic Attacks to Tank Pursuits. Each racer may earn experience/levels, which lets you modify a racer to specialize in Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, or a well-Balanced version of the stats they would normally use.The only drawbacks: the difficulty curve rises sharply for each new difficulty level, and the AI-controlled racers don't mess around at all, especially on Hard/Expert difficulty; it may be a rough ride regardless of player experience, but it will still feel rewarding and thrilling to pass the toughest tests.Overall rating... 10/10, would race again.

TL;DR This game is f*cking awesome, double the fun if you got a controller and HOLY SH*T IT'S SO MUCH FUN WITH FRIENDS!Since I got a controller I was looking for that special game to play that would justify buying one, this is that game.I was trying to convince a group of friends to purchase the game with me so I would have someone to play it with for a while, I must point out that they all play almost exclusively FPS games and were repelled by the idea of playing an arcade or sonic game, yesterday they finally bought it and I swear after the first race they were all so excited and shouting over skype about how much fun they were having and we just played it all night long even though we had a workday coming we played like 20 rounds following each by saying ""I swear this is the last round before bed"".Pros:You can play this game with up to 10 friends!The controls are amazingly smooth and you got a variety of characters to choose from.Tons of ageless fun!Cons:Nopewould/10			"

												So, looking at the screenshots on display, this game looks, being completely honest, like SEGA's attempt at a spin-off crossed with a fanservice. The ideas of transforming into aeroplanes and boats, back into cars are all too good to be true, and levels that change every lap?! Oh my jeebus, shoot me down and call me Valve, and announce Half-Life3! It's just too good to be true, but it is very true. Having played most every Sonic game you can think of (going all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis platform) SEGA definitely had its highs and its lows, but this... this is possibly the best Sonic game in the more recent years, not to mention Kart Racing, AND IT'S A PLATFORMER! Who knew a Platformer could be this good?But to the actual game instead of the history then...The mechanics are so fluent, there is very little to want (it would be cool if you would like enter slow-motion and then speed up once the transformation is done though :P) and they all offer a whole new game (literally). If you're strictly good at cars, well, you won't get very far with higher AIs. Aeroplanes and cars couldn't more different, instead of having two controls, (left and right) you now have this whole new demension of up and down and everything imbetween, which means that drifting just got over 9000x more difficult. Don't even get me started on boats (literally, they're so difficult to use!) Driving the boats in this game... what can I say, makes drifting in the air seem like cake. The controls can't even be explained, you just have to buy to find out what I mean.The changing level dynamics of this game are some of the most reinvigorating aspects of any game I've played to date, and there's a good phew of them to play, as well! First lap, you may start with cars, but you may end up entirely on an aquatic level flopping all over the place. So for the first time you play any map, even after that to some extent, it's a new map every time, so if you went left at that one bend, I doubt you'll be able to do that again (on some maps, there are exceptions). And some maps are completely elitist skilled-based. Like, your first 20 times, you won't be able to come in qualifying positions. All in all, this is the kind of game that with it's cartoonyness (if that's a word... well NOW IT IS!) and it's zealous mechanics, really does restore hope in a gaming community that is majoritively starting to become dark and gloomy. This is the kind of game that you sit down, have fun and♥♥♥♥♥♥around on for hour and hours, Hell I've only had the game for a few days, and I have this much to say about it! I would love to see some better server systems though, as lag-outs and DxCs happen all far too often.If you want anything more, like a number rating; ⓴/⓴Anything more? Oh come on, please, to put it bluntly, if you don't get this game, you're missing out on the Amnesia of Scary games, the Skyrim of Free-roam, the Kingdom Hearts of Stories, the Disney of Tales, the Dragon Ball Z of action, the Legend of Zelda of Experiences, the Mario of 8-bit, the Minecraft of creativity, the GMOD of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥around... You're missing out on Sonic of Racing.			"

												If you had told me, ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed will be the best Mario Kart game ever made,"" before release, I would have called you a liar and a fraud. But, you'd've been right. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is pretty much the best kart racer on PC, if not ever. It's very much like Mario Kart with a mix of Diddy Kong Racing in there for good measure, but it seems to be built on a staple of actual skill-based racing. Unlike some of its competing series, it is possibly to win on sheer capability alone, instead of luck (and peer misfortune). Combined with a slick sense of speed and a charmingly diverse roster of Sega ""all-stars,"" it comes out as one of the bigger advances in kart racing since the genre's conception.			"

Posted: April 2, 2015
												3D racing games have generally been divided into two broad categories. First you have simulation racers, games that aim for “realism” with physics and car handling that could ostensibly make sense in our own world. Some appeal to the respected F1 aficionado, some exist as a cost-effective way for guys to pretend they have artificial access to the all the hot name-brand cars of feverish adolescent dreams. Which brings us to the other category of racing games: the arcade racer, or simply the ones that are fun: Mario Kart, F-Zero, Outrun, Burnout, and the Need For Speed series in its prime. Zip and zoom through colorful, futuristic fantasy courses, abuse fat plumbers and perpetually-90's cartoon animals with goofy weaponry, safely crash and power drift until the finish line. The brand of car you use to do so doesn’t matter. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a car at all as long as the action is beautiful.  Developed by Sumo Digital, Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed is an arcade racer that captures the spirit of the genre, its twists and turns throughout the decades, while simultaneously paying homage to Sega's better days. It borrows concepts from its forebearers and manages to improve upon them or make the formula fresh again, against the odds. The A to B routine is thus: hold down accelerate, drift around corners, repeat for a set number of laps quicker than your opponent. SASRT aims to keep your hands and senses focused at every second, no cruise control. As the name of the game should imply, the courses and cars transform: land to air, air to sea, cars become boats and planes. Nintendo 64 classic Diddy Kong Racing attempted a land/air/sea dynamic, but races only allowed one vehicle and terrain at a time. SASRT will throw you from asphalt to water or sky at a brisk pace in any given race. The tracks themselves will often transform on the 2nd and 3rd laps, ensuring that you'll stay aware instead of falling into rigid muscle memory, lap after lap. Item pickups are lifted from the kart racing subgenre that Mario Kart pioneered, but their inclusion balances out the action rather than punishing skilled players. There are no items like the oft-dreaded blue shell from Mario Kart, no items that feel excessively unfair whenever they smack you from front or behind. With enough skill, damage can even be avoided altogether through perfectly executed evasive boosting. What sets this game apart from a mere whimsical kart racer is the sense of speed. Especially on the higher difficulty levels, SASRT approaches F-Zero GX levels of breakneck precision. The vehicles don’t control like silky smooth, marshmallowy sweet go-karts, but rather strange beasts that feel like they need to be wrangled in order to reach the finish line in a decent placing.  Boosting is key to winning against the sometimes brutal AI, a task that can be accomplished in a number of ways. Smart drifting is the most important tool, with each successful maneuver giving a varying amount of boost power. Sumo Digital was also responsible for the console and PC ports of Sega AM2's OutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast, an arcade game renowned for its drift mechanics. After playing SASRT, it's apparent that Sumo has a keen understanding of that game's framework, the precarious task of coding lovely, frictive momentum into a racing game. They've even managed to keep the fast friction intact during the air race segments, a task I haven't seen accomplished by other games of this ilk (I’m looking at you, Banjo Pilot). Also borrowed from the all-important Mario Kart is the trick system. While later entries in that series allow for simple one-button tricks to be performed off of ramps for a small speed boost, SASRT designates four directional inputs on your second analog stick for accomplishing combos. You can perform backflips, forward flips, side somersaults however many times you think is smart before nailing (or screwing up) the landing. Though it’s not as complex as any trick-focused game like SSX, it’s another element to keep in mind while racing. Arcade racers thrive on a pick-up-and-play mentality and don’t need to have complex fighting game-like button combinations, but SASRT tries to keep more advanced players on their toes. You can even do tricks off the waves and crests in the water, encouraging you to always keep your eyes on the road (whatever form it takes) for ways to get ahead of the competition.Unfortunately, unlike the gameplay itself, not as much holistic attention was paid to the game’s presentation. The game comes close to being a celebration of Sega, a fanboy’s greatest hits stocking stuffer. Yes, there's an unlockable racer that transforms into Dreamcast controller, a vehicle that belches the console’s signature disc-reading grinding noises and home menu bloops. Yes, the first track in the game features a remix medley featuring “You Can Do Anything” from Sonic CD. The song that plays when Beat from Jet Set Radio gets his All-Star power-up is an awesome jam, too. All of these flourishes are nearly negated by the inclusion of NASCAR superstar Danica Patrick. And that box-office neanderthal Wreck-It-Ralph.  And the obligatory PC-only Team Fortress 2 character and some historical-esque characters from the Total War and Company of Heroes series. Once again, I have to compare Sega to its closest analogue as a publisher and a creative brand, its once friendly rival that has survived all these years as Shenmue 3 dies endlessly and Sonic’s arms are dyed blue. Nintendo’s biggest games often have a fetish-like focus on their own history,with constant throwbacks and an internal logic at play within their respective game worlds. The Mario Kart games feel like they exist in a unified world despite all the wildly different locales. Look up a picture of the Lakitu creatures: it makes logical sense that they’re the unionized workers controlling the cameras, starting green lights, fishing out racers from bottomless ditches and lakes. To be fair, SASRT does have the disadvantage (or advantage, depending) of drawing characters from various series under the Sega brand. Nintendo’s Smash Bros series does a similar feat, though the inclusion of non-Nintendo characters and worlds from Mega Man and Sonic makes some kind of sense: there’s a similar demographic of fans and a rich intertwined history behind those iconic characters. Including Danica Patrick in a game like this is as awkward, weird and incongruous as the time Sonic The Hedgehog was forced to kiss a CGI human woman back in 2006.It’s a good thing it doesn’t matter who or what you race as in an arcade racer. If Disney putting Wreck-It-Ralph in this game helped support all the people who crafted this excellent feeling Sega game, then let Mickey Mouse’s warm corporate fingers embrace all of Sega. Life support is an expensive and dear thing, keep that in mind.Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed is more than a Mario Kart clone or a “Mario Kart Killer,” more than a praiseworthy attempt by Sega to “do what Nintendon’t”. For all its blemishes, this is the best game released by Sega in years. Yes, there are many other excellent titles that have proudly worn that old blue and white logo during this past generation. But when I say Sega, I’m talking about the real Sega, a brand that had so many forward-thinking yet simple ideas that exploded into the arcades and our living rooms alike, ones far too unique to make good business sense. A Sega that was more than a corporate publishing vessel for PC strategy games and deceptive blue-hedgehog-hamster-wheels on your mobile phone. A Sega that entranced fans and made its name seem like a colorfully exotic word, a gift from the beyond, rather than the boring truth: a portmanteau of “Service Games.” Just one more quarter in the slot, one more clearance Dreamcast sold for $99, and maybe we could all have a good time for just another year.

												It's the closest thing to playing Mario Kart on a PC and it has enough bells and whistles to make it an excellent game in its own right. SEGA has a rich history and they have transformed that into a heap of excellent stages. Level design is inspired, with many a stage transforming throughout the race - the final lap is often very different to the first lap. Performance on my PC was excellent. I played in at 4k @ 60 fps using a GTX980. Never experienced any slowdown. An easy recommend for anyone who enjoys cart racing games. I'd be shocked if anyone who loved Mario Kart didn't also have a heap of fun playing this game.			"

												(This review was written BEFORE the release of Mario Kart 8, which is now my favourite racing game ever. So yeah.)I can safely call this my favourite racing game of all time, and not just because it has Sonic in it. This game features gorgeous visuals, music and characters, and fantastic track design and original concepts and stage gimmicks to keep things fresh. If it was worth me buying a second copy, as I already own a near-fully completed copy on my PS3, then that certainly states that I recommend this game to not only Sonic and SEGA fans, but fans of racing games and videogames in general. If you want more graphical charm and don't have an amazing PC (like me) you may be better off getting a console version, but seriously, buy this amazing gem of a racer right now! It is worth MORE than the pricetag of $20, and certainly more than the $5 that it is on sale for!			"

												Sonic All-Stars RACING TRANSFORMED® is a game you would rightfully assume is about going fast, then going faster. In reality it's a harsh lesson about how the world works and what to expect in the competitive job market. In your quest to go fast and feel the sunshine you will quickly find out others too want to go fast, in fact they want to go faster than you. The problem is if someone is going fast more than you are going fast then you are in fact not going fast so only one person can actually go fast. This creates a situation where much like the race for jobs and the corporate ladder, when you have everyone trying to go fast no one in fact goes fast since you constantly impede each other from going fast.Which is symbolism for the nuclear arms race.I give this game 10 WHY ARE THERE BEES OH GOD THERE'S MORE BEES WHO EVEN MAKES ALL THESE BEES OH GOD THEY'RE ALL OVER MY CAR AND IN MY PANTS AND OH GOD MY EYE WHY GOD WHY Out Of 10.

												Mario Kart doesn't hold a candle to this. SEGA and Sumo Digital have giving us kart racing perfected.The game at higher difficulties does get challenging, like really challenging, like old school challenging. Be ready for that if you want to make it to endgame.In multiplayer it's a blast, well worth it if you have a large screen for Big Picture.There's plenty of racing modes and unlocks, stuff for the casual and stuff for the hardcore.

												This game is like a Mario Kart for PC. Is that bad? Heck no. In some aspects this is even better than Mario Kart. For example, the circuits change each lap, so you are not driving the same circuit in one race, and that is great.The characters are a bit derp for me. I mean, You have Sonic, Alex Kid, and then you have a Shogun and a Roman soldier.... what? But I don't think that it's something bad, I find them really funny.The game is playable with keyboard with keybinding are pretty bad, but you can change then. The port is great in my opinion, I have no perfonmance problems.			"

												As a big fan of the SMK (Mario Kart) series and hearing a lot about this game, I finally decided to give it a go and dropped some money on it.  I chose the PC version over the Wii U version (my second choice - and may still pick it up for Wii U) because of the larger character roster and DLC.  Note that I haven't picked up any DLC - yet.Difficulty notwithstanding (I feel the game is pretty easy, even on hard), the game is a lot of fun!  Unlike Mario Kart, there are very few OP weapons, and there are no weapons that will hunt you mercilessly if you're in 1st.  As a matter of fact, it's possible to evade almost all weapons thrown or shot at you, given enough skill, which is a plus for me.  The stages are well-designed, the big point-earner being that all the stages change from lap to lap, sometimes significantly.  The stage changes result in your character changing the vehicle they're racing in on-the-fly, which brings us to a more contentious part of the game: flying and motorboating.  Although I find that a higher Handling for your character results in a more controlled flight (I personally love flying in this game, though many weapons become harder to use - there is a bit of auto-aiming provided, though), I don't get the same kind of responsive control when on the water.  Unfortunately, I feel the water physics is pretty mediocre at best, and this especially rings true on certain stages where you're on the water for most of the race.  Sega definitely invested more in flying mechanics and racing on the ground.Finally, the character selection is very diverse, with famous Sega mascots all appearing, some old-school characters that haven't seen the light of day in a long time (looking at you, Alex Kidd!), and for the PC version, PC-specific characters, such as the Spy/Pyro/Heavy trio from Team Fortress 2.  The only character that I felt was kinda just forced in was Wreck-It Ralph, who isn't a Sega character and doesn't have any games on the PC.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, though I feel it is a bit on the easy side.  Is it worth the 20 bucks?  I'd say so, though if you find it on sale, scoop it up immediately!			"

												Got this game for my kids and I'm having as much fun as they are.  This is Mario Kart on some serious steroids.   Pure arcade racing in some pretty imaginative environments.  The PC port has the usual interface hiccups - but the in game action is perfect.  Everything looks crisp and the action is fast.  I do play this title with a controller - as with most racing games this benefit from analog triggers.I had this game for the Wii U - and decided not to keep that console.  Once I saw the PC port, I knew I had to get it.  It was worth the $30 they originally charged for the game.  It was a complete steal at $5. "

												This is possibly the best Mario Kart style racing game yet. It's absolutely gorgeous, has excellent track design, the transforming vehicle gimmick works very well, lots of variety in tracks and racers, unlockable customization options for each racer, and it's just a hell of a lot of fun.Unlike the first All-Stars racing game, this one does have the full set of online modes an options on the PC version. In face, it's an incredibly solid PC port. I wonder if the three racers added from PC gaming franchises are there to reassure us that Sega isn't short-changing the PC versions of their games anymore.If you've ever enjoyed any kart-style racing game, I can recommend this one without hesitation.

												This game was unexpected. I tried a demo from the previous version on the PS3 and it was great to play with friends but this..this is just AWESOME!As a long time Mario Kart player this ain't a pure clone, it's a superior experience. You have land kart transforming into air and water machines on every track, you have super funny ""Capture The Chao"" games or Battle Arena ones, there's even a Boost Race mode.The characters are well designed and there's a lot of interesting cameos(Wreck-it Ralph and Team Fortress among others), the tracks are amazing and the graphic and light effects are just awesome.I was expecting a bad console porting too but the game just feels fluid and great.Sure, it's better played with a gamepad but once you learn the basic controls even playing with the default keyboard layout feels right and you never have the feeling you're not in control of your kart.Definitely a big big surprise I'd reccomend to everyone, playing with 2 other friends already makes it 100 times more awesome!The single player is good too and it's necessary to unlock tracks(which you unlock anyway if you play with a friend who owns it) and characters but I'd still reccomend to get it if you have friends to play with.VOTE: 8.5/10			"

Product received for free
												To be honest, I was gifted this game by a friend so I didn't spend any money on it, however... It is worth the price that it is now.The game, although filled to the brim with unrecognizable characters besides Sonic and his Friends, TF2, and Wreck-It Ralph (For me), is still fun whether or not you know who the characters are. Each character has different stats and different animations and it's always fun to try out new characters. You can also go through blue rings in order to transform and your vehicle can either transform from a car to a boat to a plane whenever you pass through them, hence why this is ""Transformed"". It's fun and kind of reminds me of Mario Kart except each stage feels unique and different, including several stages from different Sega games such as Sonic The Hedgehog, Golden-Axe, etc.DLC is pretty cool too, the best one would have to be the Metal Sonic DLC for me because Metal Sonic has to be one of my favorite villains in Sonic The Hedgehog. It includes Metal Sonic of course and a stage called Outrun which is pretty nice. Did I mention it's the cheapest DLC of the 3? ;)Yogscast would probably have to be my least favorite one, I know it's for charity, but if they really wanted to use an internet celebrity, I think they should have done the Angry Video Game Nerd, would have really liked to see some F-Bombs drop on Sonic while he's racing against him.All in all 9/10 as a racing game for me, this is probably one of the best celebrity racing games I've ever played, although the celebrities are not very recognizable if you haven't played their respected games, you can still appreciate the gameplay and who knows, it could even get you interested in their games and you could find a new one to play :P			"

It's installed and I played 1-2 hours (don't get me wrong, I love the new GTA V and I think it's pure awesomeness... but ... but this little...) and in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed I already have 9.2 hours of gameplay (single-player & multi-player).

												Why is this so fun? This game should have no right to be this fun. There is list of things in this game that should automatically make it not so fun and enjoyable.1: It's a sonic game2: It's made by SEGA3: It's a sonic game that has characters in it other than Sonic.4: It is made by SEGA5: It's a modern Sonic game made by SEGA6: It's a blatent Mario-Kart cloneAll those things combined should make it the worst game that SEGA has ever produced, but it's not. It's actually extremely fun and addictive like classic Mario Kart games were, the visuals and track designs are gorgeous in detail and faithfulness to all the classic SEGA franchises, especially the after burner stage with the remix of it's godlike stage theme. I cant believe I'm saying this, but All Stars racing is definitely a game worth buying no matter the price, it's a Kart racing game done right.			"

												As far as I can tell, this is your best option for a kart racer on the PC without resorting to emulation. I've found that kart racers are either really fun, or terribly bad, and given Sonic's track record over the past few years, it feels like this would have been an awful game... surprisingly enough, this is a great fun time and I definitely think it is worth checking out. It also gets a special mention for having 4-player local co-op, which is unfortunately rare. Great level design, fun racing mechanics, and it has enough content to last you awhile.			"

												+ Very polished racing game+ Known characters and scenarios from famous SEGA games (and a few characters from games not developed or published by them)+ Great amount of content+ Tracks feel fresh and well elaborated+ Gorgeous graphics+ Smooth and intuitive gameplay+ Arguably, the DLCs seem fair considering how much content the base game offers+ Not as quirky as Mario Kart, but still pretty good (and the only option on PC that comes pretty close to MK)+ Engaging multiplayer (still active after three-four years)- Sounds can be too loud even with the volumes down by 30 levels- The narrator speaks way too much in the menus (arguably in the races as well)- Interface is too simplistic, so it might feel a bit lacking for some players- Could have more characters and tracks from other renowned SEGA franchises such as Phantasy Star, Bayonetta and Golden AxeVerdict: The first Sonic game I played was on the Genesis and it wasn't much. Then I played something someone (or SEGA themselves) released for browsers more than a decade ago. I didn't care for Sonic up until I started playing Phantasy Star Online 2. The fact that SEGA refuses to release PSO2 in the West to instead give us more Sonic games that no one asked for made me get a grudge with it, but then there's the PSO2 anniversary lobby and EQs with songs from Dreamcast Sonic games. If you're reading this and you've played PSO2 around that time, you probably know why this is a reason for me not to like Sonic.Anyway,I still don't like Sonic as a character, but I certainly see it differently as a franchise. I tried ASRT on Android and was very disappointed with it, but I've always had my eyes on the Steam release cos I knew I'd like it better if I played with a controller. It went beyond my expectations, proving to be a very polished racing game with everything I could ask of it and more!			"

												If I had to rate this game out of 5 I would give it a 3.The game is really fun! You can transform into multiple vehicles, do challenging missions to improve upon your driving skills, and face other people to see whos better. The items can be annoying, but its sooooooo easy to climb back to 1st place if you know what your doing.Though this game requires some skill, its fairly easy for any newcomers who just want to race and throw items at eachother.The only downside is how glitchy the game is. Half the time when im in the top 3, I get easily knocked back to 10th thanks to flying in the sky for 30 secs, my car suddenly going the opposite direction and forcing myself to look the right direction, and just glitching through things in general. I have played with atleast 6 friends whom i gifted to and usually one of them complains why they're glitched inside a rock or something similar.			"

												I really need to get a gamepad for this. But otherwise it's a solid racing game. Segas take on Mario Kart, Although it's very similar, most maps have your vehicle transform into a boat or a plane in certain areas. Can be fun to play against friends as well. So if you like Sega and Mario Kart style racing games, then you'll probably enjoy this.Final Verdict (3.5 out of 5)			"

												9/10 - All the great heroes from SEGA games with few from outside gathered for this racing event to compete for awesomeness, memories and victory. On the ground, in the air or in water - the battle never stops, because this is not just racing. It’s racing transformed! Players with just keyboard and mouse will find battling with controls a little harder than with A.I. opponents, but eventually they get used to. All the tracks are set in beautiful worlds of SEGA games with classic soundtrack. Who likes Sonic, other heroes, old SEGA games or kart racing games will enjoy this game a lot.			"

												If you liked Diddy Kong Racing and also a challenge; then this is a title to pick up. The level designs are unique and well made. The single player is difficult but not too difficult once you learn how to perform tricks, transformation boosts, and starting boosts. The multiplayer is fun also and items always add a new feel, making this game replay value high up there. 75% off is a perfect price. Tons of characters to play around with and lots of achievements to collect throughout.			"

Driving controls are rock solid, and I highly recommend you use an Xbox 360 controller, or any XInput compatible gamepad for the best gameplay experience. The PC version of this game even has exclusive characters that you won't find on the console versions. Overall, this is an excellent kart racing game that you and your buddies will enjoy playing.

There's a lot of fun packaged in this game with unlockable characters, vehicle mods, cups, time trials and a selection of multiplayer modes.The visuals are lush and colorful even though not the most advanced they serve their purpose.Audio design is overall great with some themed classic tunes blasting when a character gain power ups.A must have for any fan of the genre.

												Cause Driving A Kart Wasnt Hard Enough As Is...Game Mechanics - 2/2Story-line - 1/2Graphics - 1.5/2Soundtrack - 1.5/2Replay Value - 2/2 Total Score - 8/10So here I find myself writing up another Friday review for some faithful, interested gamer out there and I wouldn't have it any other way. With that said welcome to another Friday video game review here on In The Mind Of My Mind with your friendly neighborhood gamer Zalgo_Cometh. I been waiting and wanting to get myself a copy of this game from I heard they were making a part two after all the success the first game received. We reviewed Sonic & Sega All Star Racing two years ago and now its back for round two.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a racing video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, the fourth installment in the Sega Superstars series, and the eighth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Do you think the sequel lives up to its predecessor  Let's find out on today's exciting episode of Dragonball Z..........wait wrong show; I mean on today's blog review. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a mascot-based racing game in which players race against each other using characters from various Sega franchises, although it features many new mechanics and improvements from the last game. The most obvious is that, at certain points in a race, vehicles can alternate between car, boat and plane modes. The car mode handles similarly to the previous game, in which players can earn boost by drifting around corners or performing tricks whilst in the air. Boat mode features true boating physics, requiring players to consider their vehicle's turbulence. They may also be affected by waves made in the water, some of which can be used to leap into the air and perform stunts. Plane mode, the fastest of the three forms, gives players the freedom to move both vertically and horizontally. Like the other modes, players can 'air-drift' around corners to earn boost and can also perform rolls to quickly adjust their position, earning boost for narrowly dodging obstacles. Players alternate between these modes by driving through blue transformation gates. Certain tracks in the game terraform as players proceed through them, offering different play-styles between each lap.What’s Good:Game-play: I must say Sega really listened to the fans and went all out to improve this series and I certainly see it as a worthy competitor to the Mario Kart franchise. With a wide variety of tweaks and subtle game-play enhancements this game certainly has quite the competitive edge to offer. When playing this game it certainly feels like a true race that is determined mostly by skill and not just sheer luck. From the changing track layout to the varying modes of transportation to the subtle handling differences in the varying modes of transport; Sega has offered up a selection of any and everything imaginable to affect a racing game of this wacky and nostalgic nature. Add into that the wide character roster of old and new faces alike and you simply cannot go wrong.Replay Value:With such a wide cast of characters to explore how could you not have replay value? Add to that a variety of race modes and tracks for both single player and multi-player enjoyment and you will be begging for a break. Sega went even further and gave us a leveling system for each character and different car mods to unlock and explore for each of your favorite characters. This is what you call some serious replay value.What’s Bad:Story-line: WHERE IS THE STORY LINE? WHY DO I NOT KNOW HOW THESE CHARACTERS ALL GOT TO THIS DIMENSION? WHAT ARE THEY EVEN RACING FOR? Hell the most important question of them all is why Sonic is even driving a car when he is obviously the fastest participant of this whole racing game? Trolling aside it would have been nice to have a dedicated story-line to help add value to the game and develop more interest in the varying characters. What Should Have Been Added:Pretty much like I said that only main thing I would have wanted to see was a properly fleshed out story to help solidify this game.Final Thoughts:I am definitely glad to see the success this game is receiving and hope that Sega and Sumo Digital continue to make this a worthy addition to the kart racing game genre. especially since its the only kart racing game I know of that has a version for PC which is way easier to get people to play on locally than with a handheld or a console. I hope to see continued variety of character inclusion from the illustrious Sega collection of characters they have at their disposal. "

												This is possibly the best Kart racer I have ever played.  Having grown up as a SEGA fanboy, this is the SEGA answer to Mario Kart that I always wanted and the PC version definitely gives Mario Kart 8 a run for its money! It's also a great livingroom PC/HTPC game, as it supports up to 4 players on a single screen (local splitscreen.)The tracks are varied and well designed, with plenty of shortcuts and bonuses which reward skilled players.  Being a huge SEGA fan from back in the day, I really appreciated the call-backs and themes the levels offered (Golden Axe, Shinobi, Skies of Arcadia, and more!)As far as difficulty is concerned, this game is no cakewalk.  There is a learning curve involved in teaching yourself how to drift, how to boost, and how to stack boosts in order to be competitive, but the game greatly rewards you for building your skill.  Beware: The A.I is absolutely cutthroat and they won't show you any mercy while you're still getting used to things.  While at first they seem to be absolutely unfair, they can be overcome with practice and skill as well as knowledge of the track.  They do not rubber-band to the player like Mario Kart's opponents do in older entries.  There are items which you can use to attack/sabotage other drivers just like in Mario Kart, however they play less of an important role in SASRT, as you will not find yourself getting item-spammed at inopportune times if you're good enough to get ahead of the pack.The tracks themselves can change lap-to-lap and new situations may require a new type of vehicle.  That's where the ""transformed"" part of the game's name comes in.  Each vehicle is capable of transforming from a car to a boat to a plane and back again, depending on the level's terrain.  The transformations are automatic (so you don't have to worry about having the wrong vehicle type at the wrong time) and they add a great variety to the overall gameplay.  There is a learning curve involved in learning the different handling of each vehicle type (especially the planes), but they are not difficult to get a hang of.Each character has unique stats and abilities and they can be leveled up through racing and completing events/challenges.  When leveling up, you can unlock 'mods' which drastically alter your character's stats and can be helpful on certain courses (for example, the handling mod will boost cart handling and can help on an icy stage with lots of turns.)Another huge advantage that this game has over Mario Kart is its Single Player campaign.  While Mario Kart only really offers a Grand Prix and Time Trial mode for its single player experience, SASRT offers both of those plus a ""World Tour"" mode in which players must complete a wide variety of events (races, drift challenges, boost challenges, combat race challenges, etc) to earn stars which can be used to unlock additional characters as well as stat/kart upgrades.  If you want, you can even play local multiplayer in World Tour mode (up to 4 players) and everyone can take on the challenge simultaneously. I found that I got a good 30 hours of gameplay out of World Tour so far and I haven't even 100% finished it yet; there's lots of content to be had!I highly recommend this game to any fans of racers, Sonic, and SEGA franchises of old.  You won't find a better Mario Kart alternative on PC (short of emulation.)			"

A wonderful game that pays tribute to everything Sega, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is something that will crush the competition for years to come.The Good:Level Design and Diversity: S&ART's levels come in many different shapes and sizes, and all of them provide a rich, detailed and fun experience for the players. From challenging levels make Rainbow Road look easy to wonderfuly crafted thematic levels such as  Dream Valley, S&ART has a level for every skill level. Character Diversity: Every vehicle and level in S&ART has it's unique style and feel and style. From General Winter's Tank to Shogun's wooden... Chariot, The level of character diversity in S&ART easily surpasses the majority of arcade racing games on the market.The Notable:The Boats and Planes: The addition of boats and planes has opened up many unique opportunies for fun and often whacky levels. However, this is no Skydrift or Hydro Thunder. The boats often feel slow and clunky, and the feeling of being in water is only kept there by the predictable wave effects. The planes are meant to be the fastest and most agile of the vehicles, and yet they feel very bloated and dance through the sky instead of cutting through the air. Drifting is also a very gimicked function on these two modes, and serves as a tie-in feature to keep the feel of the game consistent. Modes that aren't Racing: From 'Capture the Chao' to 'Battle Arena', secondary modes serve as mostly a distraction (albeit an intresting and somewhat fun one) from the core of the game. The fun that one may have is generally very inconsistent as these modes generally rely on utilising one feature of the game over and over again. The Bad:Poorly designed PC Menus: Graphical customisation cannot be done in game, it must be instead configured through an external menu. The placement of the menu items in game are also have a 'console port' feel, with clunky selection menus and awkwardly placed buttons.			"

												Where Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing was a fun, casual Mario Kart knock off, this latest installment to Sega racing has been transformed (ho ho) into a fairly unique and challenging experience.  Well, as unique as Sega gets these days.  Fun racings.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=acceptable 5=lovedGame design: 4/5  Controls and graphics have been tightened up a lot since the last game, and I didn't think anything was wrong with them then.  I'm not paying attention to the music nearly as much, but that isn't a bad thing.Tone: 4/5  Not nearly as light hearted as the last game, but that suits the changes perfectly.Personal skew: 3/5  Meh.  Sega promotes both aspiration and fear in my heart.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed completely outclasses its predecessor, Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing, in every way. This game is amazing, and playing split-screen or online multiplayer with friends is a lot of fun. The character selection, course design and gameplay are some of the best in the genre, and the soundtrack is an absolutely incredible selection of remixed classic tunes, to which you can credit Richard Jacques, also known for his work on Sonic R, Sonic 3D Blast Saturn and Metropolis Street Racer, among many other things.And it's not just a straight console port either! In fact, while this game is great on X360, PS3 and Wii U, the PC version is the definitive version, offering improved textures, resolution and is the only version capable of running in 60fps. The PC exclusive characters leave a lot to be desired though, but their presence doesn't retroactively ruin the game. They're just not a deal-maker over the console editions.If you're sick of Mario Kart, then this is the best Mario Kart killer since Crash Team Racing. It's a game that is truly full of surprises.

												It had been a long time since I last played a good old racing kart game, and suddenly this game appeared before my eyes on Steam. By looking at some videos of the gameplay and reading some of the positive reviews I decided to give it a shot, and boy did I become a fan real quick! I have always liked kart games like these for their beautiful colors, goofy characters and creative weapons and this game nails those spots right on!With beloved characters from the SEGA universe and some newcomers, this game offers a real nice variation of vehicles along with awesome and unique All-Star moves to go along with which lets you choose your way to devastate the track when you're having a bad day and watch you fly right past the competition in an awesome spectacle, may it be by the usage of rockets, soundwaves or bananas. The creative weapons are both amusing and rediculous and makes the races go completely out of control which is one of the charms of kart games like these. You can also find the usual powerups which lets you boost up to higher speeds or block incoming attacks, but with all the crazy weapons and powerups aside, this game can really offer you a test of racing skill to see if you got what it takes to go even faster by using risky air-stunts and powerful drift-boosts which, altough makes the game a little more difficult, also makes the game more thrilling and exciting and overall more fun. The race tracks are, what you would expect, tracks based on several of the SEGA character's original titles which definitely is a must for party games like these, and putting the ""Transformed"" in this game's title is the fact that in most of the stages there is a transition to race by both boat and plane during the race which puts more variety and challenge into the game.So if you're a fan of racing games with elements of driving by car, boat and plane as well as neat combos you can pull off, or even if you're just a fan of Sonic and his friends I truly recommend and tell you that this game is for you!

												Where Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing was a fun, casual Mario Kart knock off, this latest installment to Sega racing has been transformed (ho ho) into a fairly unique and challenging experience.  Well, as unique as Sega gets these days.  Fun racings.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=acceptable 5=lovedGame design: 4/5  Controls and graphics have been tightened up a lot since the last game, and I didn't think anything was wrong with them then.  I'm not paying attention to the music nearly as much, but that isn't a bad thing.Tone: 4/5  Not nearly as light hearted as the last game, but that suits the changes perfectly.Personal skew: 3/5  Meh.

												Do you like Mario Kart, but no longer have the patience for proprietary, single-platform titles? As a former Nintendo loyalist in my youth, I now see the light and have a great appreciation for developers who bring quality games to every venue, and this is certainly one such example. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a modern cart-style racing game and you can often find this on sale for next-to-nothing.Great to have in your library if you've got a local co-op gaming den like I do. All else fails, if your guests really aren't into Monaco, Hammerwatch, Gauntlet, FORCED, or any of the other more mindful 4 player co-ops, a mindless game like this will do just the trick.			"

												Sega, a company who live mostly in our memories. When it comes to talking about our favorite Sega games, you'd be hard pressed to name one game that was released in the past decade. As a test, i asked a few of my friends on Steam what their favorite Sega game of all time is.My best friend said ""Sonic 3"", Streets Of Rage 2 was another game mentioned by a few of my Steam acquaintance as well as Shenmue, but nothing from the past 10 years.Just to give some insight into my history as a gamer, i grew up as a Nintendo gamer. My first console was an NES which i got for Christmas 1991, so it's fair to say, i was a Mario fan from day one.The playground debate over who is better out of Mario and Sonic was always a no brainer to me, because as much as i loved Sonic The Hedgehog (and i did), Super Mario 3 was the game that blew everything else away and completely obliterated the competition.Yes...you couldn't go far wrong with Mario. From 8 bit to 16 bit, from 16 bit to 64 bit, from 64 bit to 128 bit, Nintnedo always seemed to know what direction push Mario in, but with the success of 3D Mario games came similar attempts at 3D adventure games from other companies trying to achieve the same levels of success.Introducing Sonic Adventure, The Dreamcasts answer to Mario 64. The first thing i ever saw of Sonic Adventure was a screen shot in a games magazine, and it blew me away. The graphics looked phenominal and i remember thinking if Sega manages to transfer the same gameplay from 2D Sonic games into 3D, this might be a Mario 64 killer....but little did i know, it would be the start of Segas downfall.In present day 2016, attempts at recreating the Sonic franchise have been many. 3 Sonic Adventure games, Shadow The Hedgehog, Sonic Riders, Sonic And The Secret Rings, Sonic Rivals, Sonic And The Black Knight, Sonic Colours, Sonic Generations......the list goes on, and only sequels to the megadrive series of Sonic games captured a majority of peoples imaginations.With this in mind, I approach every Sonic game with an equal amount of skepticism and trepidation, but when i noticed Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed in a Steam sale, my curiosity got the better of me...and i'm pleased to say, i'm glad it did.You may be wondering ""why begin a review of a Sonic game with a whole spiel about Nintnedo"", and this is why. Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed is a Mario Kart killer!. Yes, despite the fact Mario Kart games are rated higher and have a wider fan base, i can't help but feel Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed fell victim to the sour taste left in peoples mouths whenever the name ""Sonic"" is mentioned. According to my Steam account, i have put 22 hours into Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. In which time i have 100 percented it, something i never feel an incentive to do when playing a racing game, however, this game is so fun, i didnt want to leave any of it unexplored.Just to state a few reasons why i believe this game is a Mario Kart killer, firstly the track design. Where Mario Kart suffers from repetetive courses that stay the same, courses in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed changed depending what lap you're on. The first lap might be land based on four wheels, 2nd lap on water and 3rd in the air. Your vehicle transforms to accomodate changes in terrain and is done automatically and with such fluidity that it dosnt distract from what is a consistently smooth exoerience throughout.The power ups are far more balanced and you don't often find yourself dropping from 1st place position to 8th in the blink of an eye just because someone decided to pull a blue shell from their back side.Those are just 2 points which i believe to be factually better than what Mario Kart offers. There are many more aspects of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed which i prefer to Mario Kart, but these are all matters of preference that i don't feel the need to mention, mostly aesthetics and other opinion based aspects.To end this review, i'd just like to say i have over 150 games in my Steam library ranging from RTS to RPGs, from First Person Shooters to Point and Clicks, from Racing games to beat em ups, and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the most fun iv'e had thus far.95%			"

												This game is the Mario Kart 8 equivalent for PC! Characters are not as memorable, but functionally it's just so much fun. Split-screen and online modes are all available, and it works perfectly on both keyboard and controller. Maps are extremely lively, there's so much happening, and gameplay is constantly spiced up throughout the laps with cars, boats and flying machines. Pickups are easily recognizable after even the first race, making it very easy to just jump into if you've enjoyed Mario Kart in the past (on SNES, N64, GameCube, Wii etc).It's a living-room blast.

												This game is a solid addition to the ""Kart Racing"" genre. I put kart in quotes because there are no karts in this game. What there are instead are some pretty solid cars, planes and boats that all control and handle how they should do. In this game I never find myself annoyed at the game for how it plays, if something goes wrong usually it's my fault.I also like the difficulty in this game as well, it's not a ""cheap"" difficulty where you are bombarded with special items left right and centre, no. Oponents actually drive pretty well and don't seem to follow a set path but rather make decisions to throw you off.Is this game just another Mario Kart clone? Far from it, it's not even in the same league. I would play this over Mario Kart any day.The music, by English composer Richard Jaques, is pretty damn good. With remixes of some classic Sega tunes and some pretty good original compositions you really cannot go wrong with it. And yes, this is the same man that did the Catchphrase theme song (didn't go where you thought it would did you?)If I did have one complaint however (and this one works in MKs favour) the courses can be very long, almost too long so if you haven't got much time to play a game, this isn't the game for you.

												Awesome. 9/10Nostalgic & classic, yet also very competitive, challenging and has incorporated diverse styles of gameplay within the races. This game is controller friendly and fun for pretty much anybody wanting to have a casual jam session. Great for multiplayer/online gameplay.The different race tracks are beautifully structured and the classic iconic characters fit the themes of their cars so well. The interace has a really classic arcade layout but the frames are well polished. I love the graphics... I don't know how some people could complain about them. This isn't meant to be a realistic driving simulator, it's an SEGA-themed arcade racing game.The composition is a masterpiece. I love the textures and rich lighting that give the game a warm, vibrant and fast paced racing environment.I never thought I would find so much joy in what originally appeared to be too 'childish' for a grown man to play but the game is just awesome. I hope that other manly men with beards still feel manly after playing this game.			"

												7.8 / 10 - Too much water.Pretty fun game, but very broken. When things stay on the screen it becomes unplayable.Ease of access to change the Video Settings and Controls is terrible, I don't know why you can't just change them in-game. It would sure make things a hell of a lot easier, but I'm sure there has to be some reason for it.Decently fun game though, been looking for any racing game really to fill the void and it does it well I guess. Good to play with friends, good gift to give to friends you'd like to play with and mess around. However, I recommend getting it on sale, and having friends to play it with.			"

												A surprisingly coherent racing experience. The AI is genuinely challenging (and not in the typical racing rubberbanding kind of way) and playing online against others is legitimately fun, even when you lose. If you're a fan of Sega franchises and characters, you'll find that you'll likely have one or two characters you'll enjoy racing as. There's even a handful of third party characters that were all crossover promotions. The differences between the characters are all pretty subtle, and the modifications offer a great way to adjust your favorite character(s) to be more in line with your playstyle. Some of the picks for characters are odd (Danica Patrick?) and others are clever.The tracks themselves are interesting, all based on Sega franchises. Unsurprisingly, there's a ton of Sonic-related levels, but lots of other franchises get representation in stage form, as well.My only gripes with the game comes with the learning curve. You'll find that after two or three races, driving and boating sections will become second nature, and it'll take a few more races to learn tricks. The problem comes when you first encounter a track with flying elements. Probably the worst sections of the game, I dread when tracks are chosen that focus on flying because it's clearly the section of the game that was worked on the least, and should have been left out of the game. My guess was that they wanted to go for a Diddy Kong Racing dynamic with this one and couldn't leave flying out. It would have been a far, FAR better game without it.The other modes that aren't racing are half-baked at best and completely unenjoyable at worst. The game's engine is clearly not made for anything other than actual racing, and it shows when you play battle modes or Capture the Chao. You'll want to steer clear of those game modes completely and focus on just racing.Otherwise, the game is a coherent racing experience and is legitimately enjoyable. It's fast paced, and the weapons are fairly easy to utilize (though some require a bit of skill to use effectively). The sense of speed on some tracks is fairly exciting, and it's possible to boost almost constantly on a number of tracks, rewarding skilled players but offering a learning challenge to new players. Highly recommended to support this game in hopes of a sequel that removes the flying aspects.			"

												Really enjoyable game, I love playing it local co-op with my brother. Car selection is great, everyone can find a car he likes to play with. The only thing that annoys me is that sometimes some races just seem impossible, and you can't skip them to progress to other levels. It bugs me a bit, but I guess it poses a challenge, which is nice.			"

												Quick factsGood+ Solid port that runs well on many systems and looks good (tip downscale from 4k for better results if your hardware can handle it).+ Customize the stats of your driver to your liking with mods that you unlock just playing as them.+ Responsive controls that reward drifts and air tricks accordingly.+ Good soundtrack with tunes from some of Sega best games.+ Dificulty options for new players and experienced kart game players.+ Multiplayer local play with special mention to the option of the possibility to play the entire campaign cooperatively.+ Online multiplayer modes for up to 10 players per event.* Full Xbox 360 controller support with rumble.Bad- A little barren online community (nowadays)- Some bugs here and there (mostly in the track physics)- Generic items and some derivative courses.- Some form of balance issues.- Ommision of some other good franchises from Sega.One of the best ""karting"" games that exists on PC, and one of the select few that give the Mario Kart series a run for it´s money. The gameplay mechanics reward skill and dedication, even giving the players the options to choose his real favorite character and choosing determined stat presets to set it at their preferred style. The method of controlling your vehicle is a little loose, and the physics act a little wacky from time to time, something that can bother the way up to the podium in the S class difficulty. Also, the online mode doesn´t get many players nowadays, so it´s more likely you end playing only with your friendsGood variation of tracks from classic jewels from Sega like Panzer Dragoon or Burning Rangers, and   the soundtrack sports some great tunes from After Burner, Shinobi and more. Not as stellar as the soundtrack, the item selection is one of the most boring i have seen in a game, but well it´s not THAT broken, like the infamous Mario Kart blue shell. The game is well suited for new and veteran players alike, and more enjoyable with a controller. Solid choice for playing in local mode with splitscreen for up to 4 players.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is THE kart racing game on PC. The great single-player campaign, tons of online game modes and options, split-screen multiplayer, plus classic SEGA characters and tracks add to the fact that this is the best kart racer that isn't Mario Kart. Sure, there are some odd non-SEGA characters, and no custom music selection like the first game, but every party needs a little bit more racing transformed with the help of SEGA.			"

												I know what people normally do with this game, which is compare with Mario Kart... Which they have very close features, but this game deserves to be tested and felt on its own. So... forget any previous MK experience and give this game a try!I've bought this game while on sale, so it was very cheap. And I have no regrets! This game really drove me nuts trying to perfect my drifting skills.Unlikely any normal go-kart arcade game, this game actually benefits from some real racing techiques like following the corners apex to get the fastest lines like no other arcade game I've played so far. That really made me happy, since I'm a huge fan of sim racing style gaming, and for a 'just for fun experience' kind of game, this really made a fusion of what I like on a sim racing game and the fun chaos of an arcade game.But, that doesn't mean you need to have any kind of experience in sim racings to have fun in this game. It's just that to get to a perfection (Specially trying to beat the devs fastest laps on each circuit), it's something to be considered.Some pros and cons that I really would like to show:Pros:- Really fun go-kart/arcade racing game. Easy to get into, hard to master.- Power-ups that range from a homing rocket, to a Super Star item which makes you invincible and can change the race results at any time.- Very good sense of speed and physics.- Stunt/Drift techniques that gives you boost.- Some tracks completely change from one lap to another, which makes each lap a unique experience.- Different kind of vehicles at different sections of the race (Car, Boat and Plane).- Very good amount of tracks to choose from. (Not too many, but not too few)- Great host of drivers to choose from, each with their own ups and downs, all from different SEGA Games.- Great soundtrack!- Very nice visuals.- Several different game modes which changes completely the way you play.- Lots of unlockables.Cons:- A Little bit tricky to learn the controls at the beginning (Specially when flying).- Some cars are better at some tracks than others.- Online multiplayer is a little bit weird. Sometimes you finish a race, but it doesn't actually finish the race. On server side, your character gets stuck somewhere and you dont get to finish the race.- Sometimes the stunts don't work and try to compensate in the next trick, which results in 'Stunt Failed' and boost loss.Overall, this game is a really fun experience, wether your looking for a fun time playing with your friends, alone or online, or trying to master all the tracks shortcuts and routes.Definitely a must buy if you're an arcade racing game fan!

												This is the best kart racer you can get right now. I find the controls and physics in this game make much more sense than the most recent Mario Kart, for example. If you remember playing Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64, this game feels very much like a spiritual successor (in the best way).Pros:- Excellent single-player mode with a variety of events (races, drift challenges, and more)- Local co-op for the single-player mode where secondary players and easily join/drop-out between any event- Game rewards you for taking risks and drifting- Game controls are easy to understand but can take some time to master (drifting feels really great)- Tracks are varied, fun and interesting to play, and each has an excellent music trackCons:- Infrequent glitching in particular walls and aerial obsticles such that they can sometimes be quite punishing if you hit them- Playing as a slow character lowers the speed of opponent racers (NPCs) in single-player9/10 - The flaws are minimal and become non-issues as you will need to be very good to beat the game on max difficulty anyway. This game checks all the right boxes (amazing soundtrack, great gameplay, replayability)			"

												I usually don't like racing games but this... this is addicting.I mean it's so fun, I don't know half of these guys because I'm not a Sonic/Sega fan but they do seem a charismatic and diverse bunch!The items are straightforward and there aren't much of them, but they're different and easy to use after some practice.The driving requires a good amount of skill between drifting, acrobatics and other stuff that helps you boost your speed.All in all, it's easy to learn, but hard to master.I like the fact that your ""car"" or kart becomes a boat or even a flying jet (!) in certain areas and it's a totally different feeling, like, flying is not a dumbed down version of a car, you go up down whenever you like and the boat is hard to maneuver.I've been having TONS of fun with this battling against friends online or inviting guests like my girlfriend, plugging 2 controllers and playing, you can even combine controllers + keyboard and then go to an online match!Overall, as a guy that doesn't like racing games, I loved this one, probably the first and the last, recommended for parties at your house or just plain fun.

												Best cart racer I've played to date. So much fun playing in multiplayer and was for sure worth the money. No character is too OP, everything is nice in balance. Tons of attack items to pick up and races and the game runs smooth and beautiful at 60 fps.9/10I completely recommend this game.			"

												A lot of people think this game is just a copy of Mario Kart 7, due to the flying and boat transformations. However, alot of people don't know that Sega had the Idea first. I bought the original game on my DS. Not very good graphics or gameplay. Then I saw this game on sale, and I couldn't stop myself from buying it, as well as a little bit of DLC. This game is amazing. 10/10. The graphics have improved, though that may just be my opinion because of the DS' graphics. The gameplay is better than Mario Kart. In Mario Kart 7, during the flying sections, you don't feel much control. Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed fixes that. At first I didn't realize I had much power over flying, so I ended up in last place. I even had the game turn on Y-axis. Also the game's cast of characters are great. Wreck It Ralph, Yogscast, Pyro, Heavy, and Spy all make appearances. Well, Pyro, Heavy, and Spy make up one team called Team Fortess, so, does that still count? I'm saying yes. Anyways, if this game wasn't on sale I probably wouldn't even try it. But, I ended up loving it. Man, I love this game. "

												I'll do a legit review now. Okay so I have this game on PS3, Vita, on my 5S, and used to have it on 3DS. Still haven't gotten tired of this game after a year and a half of playing. On PC theres more characters than the other versions plus it plays at 60 FPS (if you have the hardware)Mechanics are solid, physics OCCASIONALLY get outta whack. Great variety in the tracks too. 10 player online races and battles. World Tour, GP, Time Trials and Single Races are the modes made up for single player. World Tour is basically a mission mode with missions like beat the ghosts time, or avoid traffic, or boost races which are races without power ups but boosts are spammed on the track, battle races give you 3 lives and you race for 1st place unless you eliminate everyone on the track with power ups.Highly reccomend this			"

												I already had the android version of this game and it is great but the PC version is so much better as it has more characters to choose from and  more tracks to race on. The graphics look very good better than anything on the ps3 or xbox 360 and probably on par with a lot of xbox one and ps4 stuff and even runs on max setting  on my ordinary non gaming laptop.The game is fun and adds something new to the kart racing genre with vehicles that transform from cars to boats to planes. I just wish sega would put out more great games like this or like the ones they used make as a console manufacturer. Bottom line this game is good enough to challenge mario kart as the king of kart racers and with the transforming aspect of the race SEGA still does what nintendon't.			"

												Simply put, this is easily one of the best kart racers in a long time. The online is fun, especially if you have a enough friends to get together and form a party, matchmaking works well with Steam. The single-player is also surprisingly really great and the various levels of difficulty should be enough to provide a challenge to just about everybody. There is a lot of content here, and particularly on PC a lot of exclusive characters. For me, this is certainly my favorite kart racer since Crash Team Racing, so I feel like that says a lot. I definitely can't recommend it enough.			"

												What at first seems like a poor man's Mario Kart turns out to be one of the largest, most polished, and, most importantly, balanced, kart racers ever made. There's no rubber band AI or Blue Shells here, the majority of races are won with one thing and one thing alone: skill. Sure, items can help or hinder your position, but they'll never be a complete game changer. Topped off with gorgeous courses, a soundtrack composed of both original pieces and remixed ones, and plenty of content, All-Stars Racing Transformed is incredibly fun and sure to keep you racing.

This game is well enjoyed in its Career mode which will have you for hours attemping to unlock courses and other characters.A great time trial online scoreboard, leaving you to try out as the fastest racer online or amongst just your friends but best of all you can have 4 players Local action against in each other in 5 different game modes or all work together as a CO-OP race crew in the career mode to bring home all the wonderful goodies...Sega shows off it's wonderful world of video game heroes and mixes in some PC exclusives. Such games includeSonic the Hedgehog, Golden Axe, Super Monkey Ball while PC offers Team Fortress Classic, Wreck it Ralph and Football Manager. Beautiful Sega. Well done.			"

http://clickbliss.net/post/92637780532/why-i-love-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed""Sumo Digital have obviously learned something from their time working on the Outrun series, because this has some of the best feeling drift mechanics since the 2006 entry. Essentially a Mario Kart style powerslide mechanic, All Stars simplifies it to a single button press and demands that you master it to properly navigate the course. Basically if you’re not drifting at every opportunity you're doing it wrong. Seriously, the drifts in this game put Initial D to shame. Also, you can drift in a plane. All Stars manages to one up Mario Kart as well by actually being fair. While there are a mass of powerups, each one of them can be countered or avoided with skill, removing the slot machine 8th to 1st overtakes of the Mario Kart series. It also means brutal online competition. Seriously, if you think you can drive just wait until you see the online community. ""			"

http://clickbliss.net/post/92637780532/why-i-love-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed""Sumo Digital have obviously learned something from their time working on the Outrun series, because this has some of the best feeling drift mechanics since the 2006 entry. Essentially a Mario Kart style powerslide mechanic, All Stars simplifies it to a single button press and demands that you master it to properly navigate the course. Basically if you’re not drifting at every opportunity you're doing it wrong. Seriously, the drifts in this game put Initial D to shame. Also, you can drift in a plane. All Stars manages to one up Mario Kart as well by actually being fair. While there are a mass of powerups, each one of them can be countered or avoided with skill, removing the slot machine 8th to 1st overtakes of the Mario Kart series. It also means brutal online competition. Seriously, if you think you can drive just wait until you see the online community. ""			"

												*Amazing game for the price! If you're looking for a PC mario kart style gameplay, this is it, except it's much better. I've had a tough time with the -Arrow Key Controls- during the flight portion of racing. I think if I bought a Steam Controller it would be much easier to control. Other than that, the gameplay is perfect. I love the competition in races. The fact that you can race on multiple environments (Ground, Water, Sky) makes it next-level when comparing it to most Kart-Racing Games.-Rate 10/10-Purchased on SEGA steamsale, was $5 then, it's $20 now. I would consider it worth it to buy at regular price. If you can catch another steamsale. It's a must grab at $5.			"

												If you have atleast 5 friends, this game will be alot of fun for all of you.It's very similiar to mario cart but instead with sonic (hence the name). Ofcourse the gameplay wont be any less worse without any friends, but the pure joy when you shoot your opponet and pass him before the last corner is something that cannot be described			"

												Easily one of the best racing games I've played, not just kart racing! While preventing the alienation of more casual players, the game manages to take the actual racing very seriously. There is an unusually high level of skill required to win in hard mode. It encourages that you learn the tracks and how to navigate them with effecient boosting, or you lose; I personally really enjoyed this!Racing against other experienced players, the items are very fun and I never felt cheated by them! All races can be won by pure skill alone; luck plays a rare factor. This is a welcome change from other popular kart racers, where victory can be determined by fire-and-forget homing attacks that cannot be prevented. Certain items in this game can even be avoided with a well timed boost, air dodge, or obstruction.Many of the stages are way better looking than I'd expect for a game of this type. There is a high level of artistry and aesthetic awareness all throughout. It looks truly fantastic at times!This is easily one of my favorite games graphically and it doesn't hurt it's a tremendous amount of fun to play! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys balanced and atypical racing.I like this game so much, I bought it for: myself, my ex, a friend, and repurchased it once it was released on PC. That should either be a testament to how great this game is, or how poorly I manage my money.The game has also been so cheap as of late, I would simply buy it to experience the visuals alone!			"

												When you first look at Sonic all stars racing transformed, it seems like nothing more than a generic kart racer staring sonic.  However if you dig deep enough you'll find a much more complex racing system than in most other racing game.  First of all in addition to the karts you also have access to boats and planes for all characters.  This is where the games design shines as often you'll get multiple options of where to go, one where you take the high road in the skies and the other plodding on the ground or in a boat.  Another nice thing is the items which are only there to spice the game up rather than giving sucky players an unfair advantage.  Even the all star move is balanced in a way that it only really helps if you know how to use it.  The game looks amazing when running at max settings though I've noticed some significant issues with fps even when at minimal settings(Though this may just be my computer.  The game does have it's flaws, characters aren't varried that much especially since all star moves are so much more bland compared to the first game, and the leveling up system is dull and tedious beyond words.  Also I highly reccomend you play this using a controller only as playing with the mouse and keyboard sucks so much its not even worth trying.  But this is the definitive version of All stars transformed as it has additional characters with more promised while the console ports are left in the dust.  And since this game has gone on sale a couple of times since it's release there's little excuse not to pick it up.			"

												I'm an N64 kart racer veteran (MK64, DKR, Lego Racers, Penny Racers, etc.), and I daresay this is as good (if not better than) any N64 kart racer I've ever played. Unlike some other games that use rubber bands, you need skill here. The variety of characters, mods, and tracks is above average for this type of game. I've mainly stuck to single-player so far, but it's been a blast. Online play works fine (but I don't have many friends with this game) and split-screen is available, but single player alone is addictive enough that I think I goofed up my trigger finger and damaged my eyes a bit.

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC is the perfect alternative to Mario Kart of a fun and whacky racing party game, if you don't own a Nintendo console.As a racing game it doesn't have the deepest mechanics, but drifting, braking and reward for skill are all there, so there's nothing to dislike. As a racing party game, it has tons of content! Customization, varied characters, stages and fun powerups... everything you want to have fun with your friends. Online play and a lot of singleplayer content make it a good singleplayer experience.It's graphics are not super great though, but they do the job. It's music is a good selection although it isn't the catchiest. The selection of characters and stages though are kind of... ackward. Ignoring the fact that Wreck-It Ralph, Danica Patrick and Team Fortress are even in this game, the selection of characters from SEGA titles in the end seem weird and don't work all that well together. In comparision to Smash Bros. where all characters fit really well together, this game as a wide and weird array of characters that don't really match. Still, the ammount of SEGA representation is here including Amigo, NiGHTS and tons of Sonic characters, as you'd expect.The system of the track changing and the cars trasforming to planes and boats really is the mechanic that makes this game really stand out. Each vehicle has different yet similar mechanics making it so it's easy and simple for the player to change control schemes, while still making it varied. That being said, perhaps it's a little too similar since the tracks are always the same and the vehicles transform in select sections make it so that it really blends in to the game too much, making this unique mechanic not stand out as much. What I mean is that the tracks don't really take too much advantage of the three forms and doesn't unlock its true potential. You don't have a option most of the time to choose if you take a shortcut for the car or a vertical shorcut with the plane. It's always the same and there isn't too much freedom to transform. Still, it's a pretty neat mechanic and is worth checking out on its own.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is perfect if you want a racing party game but you don't own a Nintendo console and it's worth checking out even on its own. It's a fun game for sure, but it's not groundbreaking and is not a real replacement to other party games since it's a PC game.Worth checking out.			"

												Tight and responsive controls, huge character and race track roster, well designed skill based offensive and defensive weapons and items, huge replay value and loads of unlockables, online multiplayer that is still alive and excelent sega fan service everywhere make this game one of the best, if not THE best kart racing games ever created.

A great kart racing gameIt plays great. You feel a sense of speed and performing drifts and tricks is fun. I have a feeling that some of the people that worked on this game also worked on F-Zero GX. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, the cars control better. (I haven't played Mario Kart 8.)But it has some flaws. The menu has an very annoying announcer, the power-ups aren't that good and the music is not memorable. And although I did say it plays great, the physics can be weird sometimes and the track design questionable. Sometimes a small mistake can mean coming to a full stop and finishing the race close to last.This game can be hard. But in my opinion, that's what makes it great. And to add variety, you also race by airplane and by boat, with the tracks often transforming themselves, It will keep you on your toes.People will instinctively compare this game to Mario Kart. But it's closer to F-Zero and Diddy Kong Racing in terms of gameplay. And that's OK with me.If you're looking for a kart racing game to add to your Steam collection, this is the one.			"

												Man, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is like being Oedipus and getting to ♥♥♥♥ your mother. I would rather play this game than do most things in my life. I haven't spoken to my sister in months. If I dropped everything to lead a life of crime, this game is the first one I would steal from my local Game Champ (♥♥♥♥ GameStop, you miscreant gelatinous♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the first drug I would buy from my local dealer who may or may not be named Meth Jim and who may or may not live on Concourse Road which may or may not be in Hackensack, New Jersey. I'm not saying that he's a drug dealer or anything, I'm just saying that if the police showed up at his door he may try to keep them from coming inside because he may or may not have an overbearingly illegal amount of illegitimate copies of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. What I'm getting at is that I think some tragedies in recent history (but not all tragedies) may have been an inside job perpetraited by some questionable government agencies. (Investigate the Benoit Double Murder-Suicide and open your third eye.) This game is an absolute treat and I would definitely buy it for my nephew's birthday. ******			"

												A terrific and well crafted racing game that'll appeal to all audiences.Stunning background visuals may take your attention of the road, DubStep/Electronica OST remixing memorial video game themes and adrenaline pumping action provide any player of any age a fresh angle to the wonderful world of cart racing. This game is well enjoyed in its Career mode which will have you for hours attemping to unlock courses and other characters.A great time trial online scoreboard, leaving you to try out as the fastest racer online or amongst just your friends but best of all you can have 4 players Local action against in each other in 5 different game modes or all work together as a CO-OP race crew in the career mode to bring home all the wonderful goodies...Sega shows off it's wonderful world of video game heroes and mixes in some PC exclusives. Such games includeSonic the Hedgehog, Golden Axe, Super Monkey Ball while PC offers Team Fortress Classic, Wreck it Ralph and Football Manager. Beautiful Sega. Well done.			"

												Sonic : All Stars Racing Transformed is a fantastic take on the arcade racing genre boasting heaps of content and replay-abilty value as well as full controller support for those using game-pads.The maps are both visually and technically beautiful, equipped with dozens of tracks varying in difficultly from simple to advanced providing a user friendly experience for new players. The Transformation mechanics adding new layers to the game, providing the player with the responsibility of learning boat's, planes and cars all handling extremely different yet somehow remaining intuitive making the game that much more entertaining.The game is equipped with a single player career mode as well as a fully-fleshed out matchmaking system. Overall this game is a beautifully fresh take on arcade-racers and I have no doubt future games will be referencing it for years to come as the genre diversifies.			"

												While this is not CTR, it is in fact one of the most balanced kart racing I have ever played.

												I'm an N64 kart racer veteran (MK64, DKR, Lego Racers, Penny Racers, etc.), and I daresay this is as good (if not better than) any N64 kart racer I've ever played. Unlike some other games that use rubber bands, you need skill here. The variety of characters, mods, and tracks is above average for this type of game. I've mainly stuck to single-player so far, but it's been a blast. Online play works fine (but I don't have many friends with this game) and split-screen is available, but single player alone is addictive enough that I think I goofed up my trigger finger and damaged my eyes a bit.

												When I first saw Reddit singing songs of praise for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed I was skeptical at best. After 21 hours of play time I can say the praise is well deserved. The carts are varied and customisable (leveling up the carts will eventually give you 7 stats mods variants to choose from). Boosting/power sliding is tight and responsive and tracks range from standard cart racing to a mixture land, sea and air which you switch between on the fly.With a roster of 29 characters, the option of 4 player local split screen and full controller support Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed really does hold its own in the cart racing genre.

Other than that, the gameplay is perfect. I love the competition in races. The fact that you can race on multiple environments (Ground, Water, Sky) makes it next-level when comparing it to most Kart-Racing Games.-Rate 10/10-Purchased on SEGA steamsale, was $5 then, it's $20 now.

												Probably one of the best racing games I've played in a long time. Everything is smooth, and flows really well. It's super easy to get the hang of (although I use an Xbox controller). Some controls are iffy and a little annoying, like trying to throw something behind you, but it's not a huge issue. Story mode is just as fun as multiplayer, and it has an impressive roster with plenty of nostalgia from other characters as well as new ones (Wreck-It Ralph is my favourite). Some voice acting is just plain terrible though, like the TF2 character(s). But it's not much to complain about.			"

												This game is a solid addition to the ""Kart Racing"" genre. I put kart in quotes because there are no karts in this game. What there are instead are some pretty solid cars, planes and boats that all control and handle how they should do. In this game I never find myself annoyed at the game for how it plays, if something goes wrong usually it's my fault.I also like the difficulty in this game as well, it's not a ""cheap"" difficulty where you are bombarded with special items left right and centre, no. Oponents actually drive pretty well and don't seem to follow a set path but rather make decisions to throw you off.Is this game just another Mario Kart clone? Far from it, it's not even in the same league. I would play this over Mario Kart any day.The music, by English composer Richard Jaques, is pretty damn good. With remixes of some classic Sega tunes and some pretty good original compositions you really cannot go wrong with it. And yes, this is the same man that did the Catchphrase theme song (didn't go where you thought it would did you?)If I did have one complaint however (and this one works in MKs favour) the courses can be very long, almost too long so if you haven't got much time to play a game, this isn't the game for you.

												The best racing game on Steam right now in my opinion. It has good characters from Sega, great courses, and amazing graphics! Not to mention that the DLC isn't too bad either. I mean, who wouldn't want to play as the Team Fortress classes or Metal Sonic!? Overall, Transformed is a lot better than the original and I recommend you pick it up if you're looking for a great racing game to play with your friends.			"

												Do you like Mario Kart, but no longer have the patience for proprietary, single-platform titles? As a former Nintendo loyalist in my youth, I now see the light and have a great appreciation for developers who bring quality games to every venue, and this is certainly one such example. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a modern cart-style racing game and you can often find this on sale for next-to-nothing.Great to have in your library if you've got a local co-op gaming den like I do. All else fails, if your guests really aren't into Monaco, Hammerwatch, Gauntlet, FORCED, or any of the other more mindful 4 player co-ops, a mindless game like this will do just the trick.			"

												Where Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing was a fun, casual Mario Kart knock off, this latest installment to Sega racing has been transformed (ho ho) into a fairly unique and challenging experience.  Well, as unique as Sega gets these days.  Fun racings.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=acceptable 5=lovedGame design: 4/5  Controls and graphics have been tightened up a lot since the last game, and I didn't think anything was wrong with them then.  I'm not paying attention to the music nearly as much, but that isn't a bad thing.Tone: 4/5  Not nearly as light hearted as the last game, but that suits the changes perfectly.Personal skew: 3/5  Meh.  Sega promotes both aspiration and fear in my heart.			"

												Don't let the title character scare you off. This game is easily among the best mascot racing titles available, and holds its own next to the likes of Mario Kart. It's relatively easy to pick up but insanely difficult to master, and you'll sink many hours into getting just one more star. Not many games nowadays support couch multiplayer either, and this is one that does it elegantly and provides a very fun time in the process.With 42 possible tracks (20 normal, 20 mirrored and 2 bonus tracks), a truckload of characters (some specific to the PC release) and many goals and achievements to earn, you'll easily be at this one for a long time.

Sure the game has alot of Sonic in it, but dangit sonic is in the name so it is expected.The racing AI in career mode gets brutal at the hardest difficulty, it makes you think the bots cheat ( protip, they do.. its to challenge you). The matchmaking has a great community with alot of familiar faces.The characters inside the game itself are nice, I think I more bought this strictly because it had Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, my favorite RPG of all time.I don't care if you love need for speed, screw NFS.. get this game!

												Easily one of the best racing games I've played, not just kart racing! While preventing the alienation of more casual players, the game manages to take the actual racing very seriously. There is an unusually high level of skill required to win in hard mode. It encourages that you learn the tracks and how to navigate them with effecient boosting, or you lose; I personally really enjoyed this!Racing against other experienced players, the items are very fun and I never felt cheated by them! All races can be won by pure skill alone; luck plays a rare factor. This is a welcome change from other popular kart racers, where victory can be determined by fire-and-forget homing attacks that cannot be prevented. Certain items in this game can even be avoided with a well timed boost, air dodge, or obstruction.Many of the stages are way better looking than I'd expect for a game of this type. There is a high level of artistry and aesthetic awareness all throughout. It looks truly fantastic at times!This is easily one of my favorite games graphically and it doesn't hurt it's a tremendous amount of fun to play! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys balanced and atypical racing.I like this game so much, I bought it for: myself, my ex, a friend, and repurchased it once it was released on PC. That should either be a testament to how great this game is, or how poorly I manage my money.The game has also been so cheap as of late, I would simply buy it to experience the visuals alone!			"

http://clickbliss.net/post/92637780532/why-i-love-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed""Sumo Digital have obviously learned something from their time working on the Outrun series, because this has some of the best feeling drift mechanics since the 2006 entry. Essentially a Mario Kart style powerslide mechanic, All Stars simplifies it to a single button press and demands that you master it to properly navigate the course. Basically if you’re not drifting at every opportunity you're doing it wrong. Seriously, the drifts in this game put Initial D to shame. Also, you can drift in a plane. All Stars manages to one up Mario Kart as well by actually being fair. While there are a mass of powerups, each one of them can be countered or avoided with skill, removing the slot machine 8th to 1st overtakes of the Mario Kart series. It also means brutal online competition. Seriously, if you think you can drive just wait until you see the online community. ""			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a lot of fun and really improves on its predecessor. The gameplay is smooth and responsive and the races feel action packed. There is a large variety of weapons to thwart your competition and a good variety of brilliantly designed courses. The courses never get boring because a number of them alternate between being ground based, water based and aviation based depending on the lap or course you are on. Different characters start off with and transform into different vehicles suited to the type of race. Each individual character also earns different 'mods' for their vehicles when they level up which alter their stats.  The announcer from the previous game is no longer in it and instead it is just spectated when you are ""owning the race"" or have performed a stunt or attack. The soundtrack is as good and as fitting  as ever with some really well done remixes. You can play with up to four players but playing against the AI also offers up a worthy challenge depending on the chosen difficulty. Playing on a higher difficulty rewards you with more stars which are used to unlock more characters, courses and bonuses.The are only two things that grate on me about this game, one being the inclusion of characters that just don't seem to fit such as 'Danica Patrick' who appeared in the game because she was sponsored by Sega. In my opinion it would have been better to include some more well known characters such as Kazuma from the Yakuza series which was by Sega. On the upside there were a few DLC characters that were added for free. The final annoyance is that I have found the game sometimes crashes to desktop for no apparent reason. This is no reason to not buy the game (because it is a justified purchase that offers a shed load of fun) but it can induce some serious rage when you're in the middle of a race or have just set up a multiplayer session.

But generally, there's so much to do in World tour mode, it's never just a string of simple races. Traffic attack is a great mode.I'm not a big fan of the music, though, the beats that underlay each track's characteristic musical theme are bland and generic.A very enjoyable, mood lifting kart racer.

So with that I'm happy to report that this game is one of the few darts that made it onto the target. It may not have hit that metaphorical bullseye of gaming excellence; however Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed will surprise you. Notably this game has pretty good ""game feel"".

												What a great game this is! I fell in love right before the first race began. The first track, based on the Sonic Adventure universe, was superbly animated, and seemed to be teaming with ""life"". The racing started out fast and beautiful, with awesome visual effects, weapons, and nine other aggrssive racing foes, track shortcuts, and a seamless ""Transformation"" between vehicles. No controller lags, no reductions to fps, just pure racing fun (I'm looking at you, Redout. This is what I expected from you, but was slightly disappointed). A true SEGA classic.

												I didn't think this game would deliver, but as a big fan of Mario Kart -and Sega- I thought it would be alright and bought it mostly to see some of my favorite characters from Sega again, but son, this game really does deliver! Gameplay is brilliant, graphics are top notch, textures are sharp & crisp, and you really can't get board of the transformations! Great tracks, and a lot of characters to unlock & level up.I ended up buying 4 copies of it to play with my friends.Note: I still did not jump into MP yet.			"

												This is the best kart racer you can get right now. I find the controls and physics in this game make much more sense than the most recent Mario Kart, for example. If you remember playing Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64, this game feels very much like a spiritual successor (in the best way).Pros:- Excellent single-player mode with a variety of events (races, drift challenges, and more)- Local co-op for the single-player mode where secondary players and easily join/drop-out between any event- Game rewards you for taking risks and drifting- Game controls are easy to understand but can take some time to master (drifting feels really great)- Tracks are varied, fun and interesting to play, and each has an excellent music trackCons:- Infrequent glitching in particular walls and aerial obsticles such that they can sometimes be quite punishing if you hit them- Playing as a slow character lowers the speed of opponent racers (NPCs) in single-player9/10 - The flaws are minimal and become non-issues as you will need to be very good to beat the game on max difficulty anyway. This game checks all the right boxes (amazing soundtrack, great gameplay, replayability)			"

												Easily one of the most addictive and fun racing games I've played in a long time. It's like a perfect mixture between N64 Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing, but with classic (and not so classic) SEGA characters. There's a good level of re-playability, with unlocking all vehicles, tracks, and gold staring every race/challenge. Tons of fun online and on couch co-op/competitive.			"

												I know what people normally do with this game, which is compare with Mario Kart... Which they have very close features, but this game deserves to be tested and felt on its own. So... forget any previous MK experience and give this game a try!I've bought this game while on sale, so it was very cheap. And I have no regrets! This game really drove me nuts trying to perfect my drifting skills.Unlikely any normal go-kart arcade game, this game actually benefits from some real racing techiques like following the corners apex to get the fastest lines like no other arcade game I've played so far. That really made me happy, since I'm a huge fan of sim racing style gaming, and for a 'just for fun experience' kind of game, this really made a fusion of what I like on a sim racing game and the fun chaos of an arcade game.But, that doesn't mean you need to have any kind of experience in sim racings to have fun in this game. It's just that to get to a perfection (Specially trying to beat the devs fastest laps on each circuit), it's something to be considered.Some pros and cons that I really would like to show:Pros:- Really fun go-kart/arcade racing game. Easy to get into, hard to master.- Power-ups that range from a homing rocket, to a Super Star item which makes you invincible and can change the race results at any time.- Very good sense of speed and physics.- Stunt/Drift techniques that gives you boost.- Some tracks completely change from one lap to another, which makes each lap a unique experience.- Different kind of vehicles at different sections of the race (Car, Boat and Plane).- Very good amount of tracks to choose from. (Not too many, but not too few)- Great host of drivers to choose from, each with their own ups and downs, all from different SEGA Games.- Great soundtrack!- Very nice visuals.- Several different game modes which changes completely the way you play.- Lots of unlockables.Cons:- A Little bit tricky to learn the controls at the beginning (Specially when flying).- Some cars are better at some tracks than others.- Online multiplayer is a little bit weird. Sometimes you finish a race, but it doesn't actually finish the race. On server side, your character gets stuck somewhere and you dont get to finish the race.- Sometimes the stunts don't work and try to compensate in the next trick, which results in 'Stunt Failed' and boost loss.Overall, this game is a really fun experience, wether your looking for a fun time playing with your friends, alone or online, or trying to master all the tracks shortcuts and routes.Definitely a must buy if you're an arcade racing game fan!

												Simply put, this is easily one of the best kart racers in a long time. The online is fun, especially if you have a enough friends to get together and form a party, matchmaking works well with Steam. The single-player is also surprisingly really great and the various levels of difficulty should be enough to provide a challenge to just about everybody. There is a lot of content here, and particularly on PC a lot of exclusive characters. For me, this is certainly my favorite kart racer since Crash Team Racing, so I feel like that says a lot. I definitely can't recommend it enough.			"

												This is the best racing game I've ever played. it's fast, challenging, and fun. There are comparisons to be made to Mario Kart, however, this is MUCH better than Mario Kart. Basically Mario Kart but better in almost every possible way. The almost being, it has some really annoying glitches, and the control scheme even with a controller can be painful over time. So, it's not perfect but it's amazing anyway! It's pretty much the only game with Sonic in it that has actually been really good in many, many years.			"

												Probably one of the best racing games I've played in a long time. Everything is smooth, and flows really well. It's super easy to get the hang of (although I use an Xbox controller). Some controls are iffy and a little annoying, like trying to throw something behind you, but it's not a huge issue. Story mode is just as fun as multiplayer, and it has an impressive roster with plenty of nostalgia from other characters as well as new ones (Wreck-It Ralph is my favourite). Some voice acting is just plain terrible though, like the TF2 character(s). But it's not much to complain about.			"

I can't believe I'm sayin' this, and this is coming from the most hardcore Mario fan out there, but I won't be sad if I miss out on Mario Kart 8!UPDATE: I have received Mario Kart 8 and though it was better as predicted, specifically in terms of tracks, car customization/mods, and graphics(gameplay is subjective), SAASRT is still extremely fun and it was a good game to play while waiting for MK8.

												Sonic All the Stars Racing Transformed is banana splitrific with its cantolopy power ups and snazrific power ups. The gampics and the graimplay is sonicrific with its banana ruff speed bootes and it Dota 2 like gamestyle. I didnt like the fact that this game gave me a horrible harvy dent rash on my asofolugist but it was worth it. The bacon levels on sonics plane form are extremely low for the orca standerds. Gorden Freeman racing would be my favorite character in this because I can just visualise him with his sexy♥♥♥♥♥crowbar all up in his hand ready to smack down the rest of the United States. All in all this movie really captured the turn based stratieges of the medevil era and how unicorns do really exist, 8 Beefs out of 9 Beefs.			"

												So, when Sonic & All-Stars Racing first came out, everyone pretty much just passed it off as a Mario Kart clone that would never quite make it. But, with this installment, it blows that idea out of the water. This is better than Mario Kart. While it has less in the way of more well-known characters and wacky items, it has its own charm with nostalgic favourites like Beat and Ulala from Sega's classics; alongside representatives from their newer IPs; all the while revelling in cheesy dialogue from them all and a range of dynamic, stunning tracks to race around. It doesn't try to be something so much greater than Mario Kart or similar family racing games; but pulls it off anyway - it's just wild and fun, The fact that rubber-banding effects are really lessened in this game is particularly welcome, although it still has its own type - the All-Star moves; although they are fun in their own way.All in all, highly recommended for anyone who's getting a bit old for Mario Kart or just wants to try something new.

												Yes, Mario Kart clones come and go but Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (phew!) stands above the rest.SASRT has flying (not gliding) sections, boating (not underwater) and car racing.  The characters aren't as memorable if you're not a huge Sega afficionado but seeing some of these locations can only make a Nintendo fan pine for a Nintendo All-Stars Racing game.The best thing about this game is that the tracks change per lap.  One lap you'll be driving and the next lap the course may get blown up, causing you to fly!  It keeps every lap entertaining as you wait to see what happens next.  The items don't afect you as much as in Mario Kart so when you get hit, you don't get as frustrated.The only negatives?  There is no Crazy Taxi course and the game CAN be a little glitchy.  Definitely worth a try if you're getting tired of your new Mario Kart game but want something new.			"

												Man, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is like being Oedipus and getting to ♥♥♥♥ your mother. I would rather play this game than do most things in my life. I haven't spoken to my sister in months. If I dropped everything to lead a life of crime, this game is the first one I would steal from my local Game Champ (♥♥♥♥ GameStop, you miscreant gelatinous♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the first drug I would buy from my local dealer who may or may not be named Meth Jim and who may or may not live on Concourse Road which may or may not be in Hackensack, New Jersey. I'm not saying that he's a drug dealer or anything, I'm just saying that if the police showed up at his door he may try to keep them from coming inside because he may or may not have an overbearingly illegal amount of illegitimate copies of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. What I'm getting at is that I think some tragedies in recent history (but not all tragedies) may have been an inside job perpetraited by some questionable government agencies. (Investigate the Benoit Double Murder-Suicide and open your third eye.) This game is an absolute treat and I would definitely buy it for my nephew's birthday. ******			"

												9/10, Far exceeded my expectationsI had been thinking about buying this game for a long time and I'm so glad that I did. It far outshines any other casual racing game I have played. Quick rundown of pros and cons:+ Beautiful game. Bright colors, tons of detail in the tracks, lots of stuff going on all the time.+ Controls are responsive and intuitive, fully customizeable+ Big selection of racers and tracks+ Drifting mechanics are top notch+ Car and plane feel perfect+ Racer mods add another dimension of depth to the game, allow you to pick a perfect racer for every scenario+ Game has a healthy level of challenge, accessible for all kinds of players- Capped at 60fps, looks pixelated at higher resolutions (I'm downsampling from 5K resolution on my 1440p monitor to fix this)- AI feels unfair at times, too perfect- Campaign mode can feel repetitive- Bumping other racers is wonky and seems to have random results- Jetski is too slippery and prone to oversteer- About 40% of the cast needs to be unlocked through campaign mode- Shortcuts are of questionable usefulnessOverall the game is incredibly fun and rewarding to play. Most tracks are set up so that you can boost almost continuously from start to finish. If you want to go fast, this is the game for you. Most of my gripes come from having to play through the campaign, where the random elements of the game paired with the perfect AI can cause you to lose races, and therefore waste your time. this can get frustrating quickly, especially in the later levels. Outside of that though, the game is astoundingly solid and one of the most fun games I've played in a long time.			"

VERDICT: Buy Now (9.5/10) Completion Time: 10-12 hoursBottom Line: ""It can stand up to just about any cart racer out there. Buy this ASAP.""PROS+Tight controls+Constantly evolving races+Fantastic graphics+Tons of things to do+Replay value CONS-Expert difficulty-One bad courseREVIEWThis is the most fun I have had with a kart racer since Mario Kart 64. This is kart racing at its finest, where you will be driving, boating, and flying a huge cast of SEGA characters through courses that are constantly evolving.Let's start out with the gameplay. The controls are incredibly tight, and racing has never felt more smooth. Similar to Mario Kart, there are orbs scattered throughout the maps that give you special abilities, including shields, extra boosts, and weapons to use against enemies. Each character has their own unique ""All-Star"" move, where you will be taking on more powerful forms such as Golden Sonic to eliminate opponents. Boosts can be achieved by getting a perfect start, performing tricks while airborn, or executing drifts for a certain amount of time. Once you master drifting, racing becomes incredibly fast-paced, and not to mention fun!This game also looks amazing. The levels are huge, with awesome set pieces that you will most likely be interacting with at some point in the race. Most of the courses are bright and alive, and if you are in first place you will be able to see the track transform before your eyes. With every single race, the course changes before the circuit's conclusion, keeping you on your toes and making each contest much more dynamic. Finally, you will get a ton of mileage out of this game (It's a driving pun). There are four offline game modes to conquer, including a career mode, a grand prix mode, time trials, and single races. Career mode involves travelling through a series of events including races, challenges, and boss battles. Completing these events earns you stars that enable you to unlock new characters and advance to different events. Grand Prix mode has you completing four races, with the most successful racer earning the gold, and time trials and single races are pretty self-explanatory. I haven't even mentioned that there is an online mode yet. There is an online mode. There I said it. All of these game modes will keep you occupied for quite a while.I only have a couple complaints. Upon completing the hardest difficulty for the Grand Prix races, an ""Expert"" mode is unlocked which has an unbelievably high difficulty. I don't know if there is just something I haven't figured out yet, but boy do you need to be on your game to even make third. Also, there is one course that I simply did not enjoy at all. I found it incredibly frustrating with many tight corners and jumps that were more of a pain than fun. But these slight annoyances didn't detract from the bigger picture.I honestly think this is one of the best racers out there. It's beautiful, fun, and will keep you coming back for more. I think it can stand up to just about any kart racer out there (I'm looking at you, Mario). Buy this ASAP.			"

												When you first look at Sonic all stars racing transformed, it seems like nothing more than a generic kart racer staring sonic.  However if you dig deep enough you'll find a much more complex racing system than in most other racing game.  First of all in addition to the karts you also have access to boats and planes for all characters.  This is where the games design shines as often you'll get multiple options of where to go, one where you take the high road in the skies and the other plodding on the ground or in a boat.  Another nice thing is the items which are only there to spice the game up rather than giving sucky players an unfair advantage.  Even the all star move is balanced in a way that it only really helps if you know how to use it.  The game looks amazing when running at max settings though I've noticed some significant issues with fps even when at minimal settings(Though this may just be my computer.  The game does have it's flaws, characters aren't varried that much especially since all star moves are so much more bland compared to the first game, and the leveling up system is dull and tedious beyond words.  Also I highly reccomend you play this using a controller only as playing with the mouse and keyboard sucks so much its not even worth trying.  But this is the definitive version of All stars transformed as it has additional characters with more promised while the console ports are left in the dust.  And since this game has gone on sale a couple of times since it's release there's little excuse not to pick it up.			"

												Okay, I know what you're thinking: This is a Sega tie-in cartoon racer that is already a year and a half old. But it's worth it, I promise. S&A-SRT is the best Mario Kart clone you never knew you wanted. Cars feel faster, items are more skill dependant to use (and are not scaled based on position), and tracks are vered and exciting. Control takes some getting used to, but is extremely tight once learned. Also, you can play as Football Manager, whats not to love?			"

												Sega, a company who live mostly in our memories. When it comes to talking about our favorite Sega games, you'd be hard pressed to name one game that was released in the past decade. As a test, i asked a few of my friends on Steam what their favorite Sega game of all time is.My best friend said ""Sonic 3"", Streets Of Rage 2 was another game mentioned by a few of my Steam acquaintance as well as Shenmue, but nothing from the past 10 years.Just to give some insight into my history as a gamer, i grew up as a Nintendo gamer. My first console was an NES which i got for Christmas 1991, so it's fair to say, i was a Mario fan from day one.The playground debate over who is better out of Mario and Sonic was always a no brainer to me, because as much as i loved Sonic The Hedgehog (and i did), Super Mario 3 was the game that blew everything else away and completely obliterated the competition.Yes...you couldn't go far wrong with Mario. From 8 bit to 16 bit, from 16 bit to 64 bit, from 64 bit to 128 bit, Nintnedo always seemed to know what direction push Mario in, but with the success of 3D Mario games came similar attempts at 3D adventure games from other companies trying to achieve the same levels of success.Introducing Sonic Adventure, The Dreamcasts answer to Mario 64. The first thing i ever saw of Sonic Adventure was a screen shot in a games magazine, and it blew me away. The graphics looked phenominal and i remember thinking if Sega manages to transfer the same gameplay from 2D Sonic games into 3D, this might be a Mario 64 killer....but little did i know, it would be the start of Segas downfall.In present day 2016, attempts at recreating the Sonic franchise have been many. 3 Sonic Adventure games, Shadow The Hedgehog, Sonic Riders, Sonic And The Secret Rings, Sonic Rivals, Sonic And The Black Knight, Sonic Colours, Sonic Generations......the list goes on, and only sequels to the megadrive series of Sonic games captured a majority of peoples imaginations.With this in mind, I approach every Sonic game with an equal amount of skepticism and trepidation, but when i noticed Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed in a Steam sale, my curiosity got the better of me...and i'm pleased to say, i'm glad it did.You may be wondering ""why begin a review of a Sonic game with a whole spiel about Nintnedo"", and this is why. Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed is a Mario Kart killer!. Yes, despite the fact Mario Kart games are rated higher and have a wider fan base, i can't help but feel Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed fell victim to the sour taste left in peoples mouths whenever the name ""Sonic"" is mentioned. According to my Steam account, i have put 22 hours into Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. In which time i have 100 percented it, something i never feel an incentive to do when playing a racing game, however, this game is so fun, i didnt want to leave any of it unexplored.Just to state a few reasons why i believe this game is a Mario Kart killer, firstly the track design. Where Mario Kart suffers from repetetive courses that stay the same, courses in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed changed depending what lap you're on. The first lap might be land based on four wheels, 2nd lap on water and 3rd in the air. Your vehicle transforms to accomodate changes in terrain and is done automatically and with such fluidity that it dosnt distract from what is a consistently smooth exoerience throughout.The power ups are far more balanced and you don't often find yourself dropping from 1st place position to 8th in the blink of an eye just because someone decided to pull a blue shell from their back side.Those are just 2 points which i believe to be factually better than what Mario Kart offers. There are many more aspects of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed which i prefer to Mario Kart, but these are all matters of preference that i don't feel the need to mention, mostly aesthetics and other opinion based aspects.To end this review, i'd just like to say i have over 150 games in my Steam library ranging from RTS to RPGs, from First Person Shooters to Point and Clicks, from Racing games to beat em ups, and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the most fun iv'e had thus far.95%			"

												Well after about 60 hours you can easily find out that I liked the game. Really. Yes. Awesome game with lots of possibilities. I wouldnt recommend EVERYbody,hardcore simulator fans won't be fond of this game but though it's a game, EVERYone should try, even if some1 doesnt have experience in kart games. Kart games, yeah the expression is important. Not really arcade racing game but kart game. This is a game where physics is missed so much that even a Need for Speed seems to be rFactor or Race07 xDD :D But of course it's not a disadvantage, physics rulez, it's funny! :D Let's see what advantages and disadvantages this game has!Pros:+ exciting and entertaining gameplay+ lots of good characters to choose from+ bunch of spectacular tracks and nice music+ funny weapons to make your opponents angry+ The absolute lack of physics is funny sometimes+ Great career mod with challenging racesCons:- Issues with multiplayer matchmaking- Some challenges may be frustrating- I liked this game so much that I cant really say lots of bad things about, but surely this game is mainly for those ones who like Sega's and Nintendo's games and their colorful worlds			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is THE kart racing game on PC. The great single-player campaign, tons of online game modes and options, split-screen multiplayer, plus classic SEGA characters and tracks add to the fact that this is the best kart racer that isn't Mario Kart. Sure, there are some odd non-SEGA characters, and no custom music selection like the first game, but every party needs a little bit more racing transformed with the help of SEGA.			"

												Awesome. 9/10Nostalgic & classic, yet also very competitive, challenging and has incorporated diverse styles of gameplay within the races. This game is controller friendly and fun for pretty much anybody wanting to have a casual jam session. Great for multiplayer/online gameplay.The different race tracks are beautifully structured and the classic iconic characters fit the themes of their cars so well. The interace has a really classic arcade layout but the frames are well polished. I love the graphics... I don't know how some people could complain about them. This isn't meant to be a realistic driving simulator, it's an SEGA-themed arcade racing game.The composition is a masterpiece. I love the textures and rich lighting that give the game a warm, vibrant and fast paced racing environment.I never thought I would find so much joy in what originally appeared to be too 'childish' for a grown man to play but the game is just awesome. I hope that other manly men with beards still feel manly after playing this game.			"

												A surprisingly coherent racing experience. The AI is genuinely challenging (and not in the typical racing rubberbanding kind of way) and playing online against others is legitimately fun, even when you lose. If you're a fan of Sega franchises and characters, you'll find that you'll likely have one or two characters you'll enjoy racing as. There's even a handful of third party characters that were all crossover promotions. The differences between the characters are all pretty subtle, and the modifications offer a great way to adjust your favorite character(s) to be more in line with your playstyle. Some of the picks for characters are odd (Danica Patrick?) and others are clever.The tracks themselves are interesting, all based on Sega franchises. Unsurprisingly, there's a ton of Sonic-related levels, but lots of other franchises get representation in stage form, as well.My only gripes with the game comes with the learning curve. You'll find that after two or three races, driving and boating sections will become second nature, and it'll take a few more races to learn tricks. The problem comes when you first encounter a track with flying elements. Probably the worst sections of the game, I dread when tracks are chosen that focus on flying because it's clearly the section of the game that was worked on the least, and should have been left out of the game. My guess was that they wanted to go for a Diddy Kong Racing dynamic with this one and couldn't leave flying out. It would have been a far, FAR better game without it.The other modes that aren't racing are half-baked at best and completely unenjoyable at worst. The game's engine is clearly not made for anything other than actual racing, and it shows when you play battle modes or Capture the Chao. You'll want to steer clear of those game modes completely and focus on just racing.Otherwise, the game is a coherent racing experience and is legitimately enjoyable. It's fast paced, and the weapons are fairly easy to utilize (though some require a bit of skill to use effectively). The sense of speed on some tracks is fairly exciting, and it's possible to boost almost constantly on a number of tracks, rewarding skilled players but offering a learning challenge to new players. Highly recommended to support this game in hopes of a sequel that removes the flying aspects.			"

												For the people who are probably asking themselves ""Is this game better than Mario Kart?""I want you to imagine this...Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed walks into a Taco Bell with nothing but a $20 bill, and he ain't gonna leave until it's all gone. One steak quesadilla, four soft shell tacos, three 5-layer burritos, a bag of Doritos and a medium Mountain Dew Baja Blast later, our friend concludes his visit to the establishment and decides to pay another to his dear friend, Mario Kart. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed knocks on the door, the sound nearly drowned out by the churning of his own stomach. Mario Kart answers the door. ""Hey, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed, what's up?"", he asks inquisitively, wondering why his friend is visiting at such a peculiar hour unannounced. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed replies ""Oh, not much, I was just in the area and-OH MY GOD, what is THAT!?"". Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed points in a general direction behind Mario Kart. Mario Kart turns to look at what could cause such a stir, but nothing is there. In this instant, Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed undoes his own belt, pulls down his pants and aims his♥♥♥♥♥towards his neighbor. Confused, Mario Kart's head turns back to it's default position to discover his friends exposed, crowning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ staring directly into his eyes. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed proceeds to blow a violent fiesta of watery♥♥♥♥♥♥chunks all over Mario Kart's stupid, fat ♥♥♥♥ing face, staining it forever brown.That's how much better this game is than Mario Kart.EDIT: I wrote this review before Mario Kart 8. MK8 is pretty much just as good.			"

												Quick factsGood+ Solid port that runs well on many systems and looks good (tip downscale from 4k for better results if your hardware can handle it).+ Customize the stats of your driver to your liking with mods that you unlock just playing as them.+ Responsive controls that reward drifts and air tricks accordingly.+ Good soundtrack with tunes from some of Sega best games.+ Dificulty options for new players and experienced kart game players.+ Multiplayer local play with special mention to the option of the possibility to play the entire campaign cooperatively.+ Online multiplayer modes for up to 10 players per event.* Full Xbox 360 controller support with rumble.Bad- A little barren online community (nowadays)- Some bugs here and there (mostly in the track physics)- Generic items and some derivative courses.- Some form of balance issues.- Ommision of some other good franchises from Sega.One of the best ""karting"" games that exists on PC, and one of the select few that give the Mario Kart series a run for it´s money. The gameplay mechanics reward skill and dedication, even giving the players the options to choose his real favorite character and choosing determined stat presets to set it at their preferred style. The method of controlling your vehicle is a little loose, and the physics act a little wacky from time to time, something that can bother the way up to the podium in the S class difficulty. Also, the online mode doesn´t get many players nowadays, so it´s more likely you end playing only with your friendsGood variation of tracks from classic jewels from Sega like Panzer Dragoon or Burning Rangers, and   the soundtrack sports some great tunes from After Burner, Shinobi and more. Not as stellar as the soundtrack, the item selection is one of the most boring i have seen in a game, but well it´s not THAT broken, like the infamous Mario Kart blue shell. The game is well suited for new and veteran players alike, and more enjoyable with a controller. Solid choice for playing in local mode with splitscreen for up to 4 players.			"

A great kart racing gameIt plays great. You feel a sense of speed and performing drifts and tricks is fun. I have a feeling that some of the people that worked on this game also worked on F-Zero GX. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, the cars control better. (I haven't played Mario Kart 8.)But it has some flaws. The menu has an very annoying announcer, the power-ups aren't that good and the music is not memorable. And although I did say it plays great, the physics can be weird sometimes and the track design questionable. Sometimes a small mistake can mean coming to a full stop and finishing the race close to last.This game can be hard. But in my opinion, that's what makes it great. And to add variety, you also race by airplane and by boat, with the tracks often transforming themselves, It will keep you on your toes.People will instinctively compare this game to Mario Kart. But it's closer to F-Zero and Diddy Kong Racing in terms of gameplay. And that's OK with me.If you're looking for a kart racing game to add to your Steam collection, this is the one.			"

												This game is more than just a racing game. Even though this game is great, I don't think this game will beat the legendary 'Mario Kart.' But, who needs a Wii and Mario Kart 8 when you can get this game for just $2.5? It's a great game with great graphics and good multiplayer system. The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. It is not easy to unlock all the characters that available for this game. The musics are good as well.When I purchased this game, I did 3 sessions of gameplay that day. The 3rd session took 4 hours long. I can't deny that I'm addicted to this game. The funny thing is, it is not easy for me to get addicted to a game easily. So yeah, pretty much this game made the addiction nerve in my body zapped for a reason.I completely recommended this game to all of you who is a fan of racing game. From my opinion, this game deserves a 9/10 rating.Last words, I'm sorry if my english isn't that good. Peace out~! :)			"

												This is a worthy successor of Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. It improves on it and is currently the best competitor for Mario Kart. It may be a little inferior to the Nintendo kart racing, but it's still an awesome game for this genre. Plus, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed isn't a Nintendo exclusive. Like the title implies, this time around you race in 3 vehicle types: car, boat and plane. And you'll frequently change between these vehicles during the same race. The car plays almost the same as the original title, which focuses on gaining extra speed through drifting and boosting. The car is stable and easy to control. You can also drift and boost on boats and planes, but the boat sections are more focused on hitting ramps to perform stunts to earn boosts and the plane sections are more focused on hitting boost panels in a more straight line, while also evading the course obstacles to get extra boosts. The boat is harder to maneuver because of the water waves and because it's harder to turn. The plane is more straightforward, with the added verticality to control. But sometimes it can be a little stiff, especially during sharp turns. But overall, the vehicle switch mechanic is fluid and the physics are great for all of them. The carrer mode is essentially the same as the previous title. World tour to me felt like the original mission mode, but more organized with added unlockables. Gran prix is just that, a series of 4 races awarding points in each race based on the final position. But this time you can't restart in the middle of it, and that's how it should be to me. Time trials are the same, but this time with added leaderboards. And of course, there's single race. The game is also way harder than the original, and the expert difficulty is hard, with some events being very hard, like some of the time trial ghosts. But it's doable with some practice, and as you play and experiment you'll get better. There's also online mode, which isn't quite dead yet, but i didn't spent much time on it. The character and track selection is also better than the original. While some characters were removed, there's plenty of new ones. Some are from the same game as others, some from other SEGA titles, some 3rd party ones (e.g. Team Fortress), and even a real life rally racer that here drives a Hot-Wheels on land. This selection feels better and more diverse, even with the removed characters. The tracks are also cooler. There's only 16 tracks (not counting 4 returning ones), but they are more diverse, longer and change mid-race, so the 3 laps aren't always the same. Added with the vehicle switch and good design for the most part, these tracks are a blast to play on. They are also beautiful as well as the graphics, a real eye candy. The soundtrack is also cool. This time the tracks are arrangements instead of ripped songs, and they work pretty well (i love the Golden Axe arrangement on Adder's Lair, as well as this course). If you like kart racing games, this is an easy recommendation, even if you think that you may like it. It may take some time for beginners to get good, but it's definitely worth it.			"

												By far one of the best combat racing games I've ever played. All 3 transformations feel like their own game, and they're extremely well polished. I highly recommend this, not only to the Sonic fans, SEGA fans, or even Mario Kart fans, but to all the combat racing fans out there. Take a seat Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing, and the rest of you. Sonic won this one.			"

												Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed is fantastic. It looks great, runs well, is full of charm and it puts a smile on your face while you play. Even if you're not into racing or karting games I really think you should pick it up. I avoided picking it up for a while as I am not into Sonic games or their characters but I have to say that it's one of the best purchases I've made in a while. Buy it!			"

												Sonic : All Stars Racing Transformed is a fantastic take on the arcade racing genre boasting heaps of content and replay-abilty value as well as full controller support for those using game-pads.The maps are both visually and technically beautiful, equipped with dozens of tracks varying in difficultly from simple to advanced providing a user friendly experience for new players. The Transformation mechanics adding new layers to the game, providing the player with the responsibility of learning boat's, planes and cars all handling extremely different yet somehow remaining intuitive making the game that much more entertaining.The game is equipped with a single player career mode as well as a fully-fleshed out matchmaking system. Overall this game is a beautifully fresh take on arcade-racers and I have no doubt future games will be referencing it for years to come as the genre diversifies.			"

												I picked this game up in a Humble Bundle. Seeing how most new sonic games are kind of bad now I didn't think it was going to be very good. It's a cart racer which I love cart racers. Mario Kart is by far the best in the category but if you dont want to spend the cash on a new  nintendo console this Sega themed cart racer will do the trick. It features Sonic and some of his buddies along with an All-Star cast of Sega characters. Including Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Alex Kidd, and more. It even includes some of you favorite Team Fortress 2 characters! Like the Sega themed playable characters it also features sega themed courses to complete. The game features several modes to play in and you can even play with your buddies. The game is also fully compatable with Gamepads and the controls are easy to pick up and learn. Fun little game and a nice addition to any cart racing fan's collection 8/10			"

												This game... is awesome. ._.I really wanted to hate this game.  I waited for it to be cheap.  I even went to the local Wal_mart and played the Wii U version before even considering this version.  The Wii U version was a bit on the watered down side as far as I could tell, but the game went on sale a day later and even had cards.  For $7 or so, I felt it was worth a try if only to get the cards and waste time with my little brother.Then, I played the game.  For starters, the announcer is a bit annoying but really hypes the game up so you always feel excited, even when you shouldn't be.  The character roster is amazing.  I even get Team Fortress 2 and JSRF characters!  Not to mention, I went ahead and bought the Metal Sonic DLC character while it was on sale, and that is now my favorite character in the game.  Half the roster is still locked, but I should be able to unlock characters through world tour mode just by spending the stars I earn from each event.Overall, the game gets a 5/5 from me.  It is the closest thing to Mario Kart you can get without getting Mario Kart. Ha.  Seriously, though, it is a great game with great visuals, great characters and impressively deep gameplay.  There is a low bar to entry that should attract newbie racers, but the veterans can really sink their teeth into this.Now, I know it's not fair to not mention the negatives, so here are a few:1.  Announcer is absurdly annoying.2.  Autosave system scares me with a ""progress will be lost"" warning every time I exit the game, even if the game isn't going to lose any data.3.  Music is a little lame, and some characters would probably do better without vehicles.  Sonic, for example, can probably run faster than any of these cars move, his own car included, and no character really has any special gameplay mechanic.4.  Some of the early challenges are actually very challenging and may scare away new players.			"

												Picked this up at a bargin under £5. I grew up playing the old Kart games especially on n64 so I was hoping this was a similar experience. Heard bad things about the original but this transformed version feels very complete. A strong Career mode with loads of unlockable characters. tracks and secrets. A very very high skill ceiling; the hard and expert difficulties are incredibly challenging and demand you master all the little tips and tricks you will discover while playing. The online community will eat you alive if you drop into matchmaking on first play. The game gives you incentive to unlock mods for your characters car as the more you use a certain racer the more mods you can use for that character. Racing, Battle mode, 1v1 elimination races, bonus style racing events (booster mode, rings and traffic mode are a nice take on the checkpoint style racing to mix things up)It has ran smooth for me at 60fps on highest settings, some really inventive tracks that nod back to mega drive/saturn/dreamcast days. (The house of the dead was my particular favourite.)It's pretty cheap and got a lot of replayability if you don't chuck the pad out of the window for some dirty scamp pipping you to a podium position with a well placed firework missile. Fuming.Enjoyed this one.			"

												A great game to pick up on sale but it is absolutely riddled with bugs. In general the maps and characters are quite diverse and interesting but be prepared to fall through the map, be taken from first place to last place thanks to the faulty catch-up system and enjoy watching your character get spawned back over open pits or in the wrong vehicle. Honestly not worth buying at full-price in its current state but would recommend getting a hold of it if you can get it during a sale.			"

												Imagine if Mario Kart was based off AND matched the pedigree of SEGA arcade racers and was full of Service Games characters like Sonic and Alex Kidd, because that's EXACTLY what we have here.Don't be a fool and sleep on this game like I did. I thought there was no way it could good, and boy, was I ever wrong. Sumo Digital has done an amazing job and any old-school SEGA fan will appreciate it.My only complaint's with the collision physics; sometimes you'll crash into a wall or an object and your kart will SLOWLLLLLLY float before becoming usable again and this will cost you the race.

												Quick, think of Mario Kart 7! Now replace Hang gliding with Jets and underwater with Boats. Now make it Sega themed. Put it on PC, and you got this game.It's a Mario Kart clone, like most cartoony racers, but it's actually an example of matching, if not surpassing, what it's cloning.Both the Jet and Boat control like you expect, and control well. The action is as fast as your skills allow. To get through the races, you need to master the 3 controls.As for the items, they are much more fair. Most notably, the ""get the leader"" item. In Mario Kart, there's the infamous Blue Shell. Don't pretend that it doesn't♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. Everyone talks about how the Blue Shell will home in at the leader, and ruin their winning streak. In this game, you have the swarm. A bunch of bees (or wasps, whatever), go in front of the leader. They can either dodge the swarm and keep going, or get hit and possibly lag behind. It can also get other players, but the major thing is, it can never hit the player who sent the swarm, so if they're right behind the leader, they don't screw themselves over. This may seem simple, but it's one example of balance. This makes things more fair.The tracks are truly eye candy and even change as players go through the tracks. Usually by lap 3. the course changes to a new transformation. This helps keeps things fresh within the same course.The characters are what you expect, Sonic and Sega. But the real catcher are characters like Wreck-It Ralph and TF2. The mix of characters in this game are really fun, and you have motivation to get the unlockables like Beat and NiGHTS.If there's anything to say about the AI, is that they will KICK YOUR♥♥♥♥♥ They don't screw around, and if you're not good at racers, you won't 100% this game. But when you start to get good, it's feels nice to feel rewarded with wins against the extremely tough AI.As for online, I don't use it much. But I hear there's lag, but it can be playable.If you're a Sega fan, get it. If you're a racing fan, get it. If you're both, GET IT! Even if it's not PC, get it on Wii U, PS3 (which is what I own), 360, Vita. It's a solid game. Altough I hear the 3DS version isn't the best.			"

												I first got into this type of arcade racing with Crash Bandicoot on the ancient now non existent Nokia Ngage. That game came free with the Ngage, but boy did I love it.Now I am loving Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed as much as if not more than Crash Bandicoot. This game is pretty fun and shoudl be tried out. I won't say much about the game mechanics and stuff, since those are being pointed out by most of the members here in steam. And most of them are in good light.If you have love for arcade racing and find this game on sale, try to get it. It is totally worth the price esp. if on sale. So all I can say is, if you do get this you will have happy time racing all those cool characters.Side Note: Even with these not everyone may like this, since everyone has different taste. I respect that, so I don't try to force my opinion on other. Some of the negative review is due to the cause that the player expect something but gets somethingelse. That is unavoidable and it happens to me also. But most of the negative review I seen for this game is like ""Don't like what I don't like!"". But then it is all upto you to decide to whether get this game or not.			"

												Want to see your graphics card do colours other than brown? Buy this game.Like kart racers? I'm pretty sure this is kart racer out of kart racer. It's not my genre of choice but once into the drifting, power-up-hogging groove it's good fun, with the usual random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry of your competitors being balanced by your own opportunities and being able to mitigate many of the ""unlucky"" breaks with skill.It's a bit of a shame that they went to the effort of licensing, designing, modelling, texturing and voicing the bonus PC characters, to stop short of giving them transform animations and just use obscuring effects instead. The launcher where you set up keyboard controls is buggy and unpleasant. Neither of these things will cross your mind while charging through Adder's Lair to its outstanding soundtrack, or watching Rogue's Landing fall apart around you as an airship battle rages, or trying to corner through Burning Depths as a voice-in-your-ear operator warns you about the flooding track's changing routes. The game is made of bright, cheery, awesome.			"

												This is a worthy successor of Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. It improves on it and is currently the best competitor for Mario Kart. It may be a little inferior to the Nintendo kart racing, but it's still an awesome game for this genre. Plus, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed isn't a Nintendo exclusive. Like the title implies, this time around you race in 3 vehicle types: car, boat and plane. And you'll frequently change between these vehicles during the same race. The car plays almost the same as the original title, which focuses on gaining extra speed through drifting and boosting. The car is stable and easy to control. You can also drift and boost on boats and planes, but the boat sections are more focused on hitting ramps to perform stunts to earn boosts and the plane sections are more focused on hitting boost panels in a more straight line, while also evading the course obstacles to get extra boosts. The boat is harder to maneuver because of the water waves and because it's harder to turn. The plane is more straightforward, with the added verticality to control. But sometimes it can be a little stiff, especially during sharp turns. But overall, the vehicle switch mechanic is fluid and the physics are great for all of them. The carrer mode is essentially the same as the previous title. World tour to me felt like the original mission mode, but more organized with added unlockables. Gran prix is just that, a series of 4 races awarding points in each race based on the final position. But this time you can't restart in the middle of it, and that's how it should be to me. Time trials are the same, but this time with added leaderboards. And of course, there's single race. The game is also way harder than the original, and the expert difficulty is hard, with some events being very hard, like some of the time trial ghosts. But it's doable with some practice, and as you play and experiment you'll get better. There's also online mode, which isn't quite dead yet, but i didn't spent much time on it. The character and track selection is also better than the original. While some characters were removed, there's plenty of new ones. Some are from the same game as others, some from other SEGA titles, some 3rd party ones (e.g. Team Fortress), and even a real life rally racer that here drives a Hot-Wheels on land. This selection feels better and more diverse, even with the removed characters. The tracks are also cooler. There's only 16 tracks (not counting 4 returning ones), but they are more diverse, longer and change mid-race, so the 3 laps aren't always the same. Added with the vehicle switch and good design for the most part, these tracks are a blast to play on. They are also beautiful as well as the graphics, a real eye candy. The soundtrack is also cool. This time the tracks are arrangements instead of ripped songs, and they work pretty well (i love the Golden Axe arrangement on Adder's Lair, as well as this course). If you like kart racing games, this is an easy recommendation, even if you think that you may like it. It may take some time for beginners to get good, but it's definitely worth it.			"

												I picked this game up in a Humble Bundle. Seeing how most new sonic games are kind of bad now I didn't think it was going to be very good. It's a cart racer which I love cart racers. Mario Kart is by far the best in the category but if you dont want to spend the cash on a new  nintendo console this Sega themed cart racer will do the trick. It features Sonic and some of his buddies along with an All-Star cast of Sega characters. Including Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Alex Kidd, and more. It even includes some of you favorite Team Fortress 2 characters! Like the Sega themed playable characters it also features sega themed courses to complete. The game features several modes to play in and you can even play with your buddies. The game is also fully compatable with Gamepads and the controls are easy to pick up and learn. Fun little game and a nice addition to any cart racing fan's collection 8/10			"

Its a love letter to all things Sega packed with beatifully themed maps and very fun and varied charcters ranging from Jet Set Radio to Shogun Total War.

												I don't know who'd not buy the game. It's amazing. And of course, has Sonic and all of your favorite characters!GENERAL:Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed gives you 3 ways to play; alone, with people from all around the world, and at private party. And there's even more ways to play when you play solo. Giving you alot of hours to play for your amusement!CONTENT:You got 30+ characters in this platform. Yes, 30 characters, including the DLC and the unlockable characters from your favorite titles: Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, and so much more! And you can play with them on over 40 tracks. That's alot of combinations there. And it dosen't stop there, you get 5 gamemodes to play with, the combinations are HUGE here.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is divine. It's like SEGA learned from it's mistakes from SEGA All Stars Racing ancestor and remade it into a more original creation. It's nothing like Mario Kart at all, where you must get OP items to win. If you play alone, you can progress through the game, collect and upgrade your characters! And some singleplayer portions are difficult. It's mechanics are also great. Don't like playing alone? Play online and show the world what you're made of!WEAKNESSES AND CONCERNS:There are problems with this game though, no matter how good it is. First being is that to win, you have to rely on one mechanic: Powerful boostings at a rapid rate. You'll never have a decent Time Attack record without a powerful character. I.E. Shadow with Dreamcast mod is one of them. But if you're skilled, you shouldn't have alot of problems with that.Another concern about this is the server. Though the community is friendly, the servers you're gonna play in, will never be. As you're mixed with these new guys, and real MLG players, and some of them may have bad connection, causing an unbearable amount of crashing into walls and such. Even MLG players suffer from that.Yet another concern is the aftermath, and I mean what happens now when you beat the game, although I like this game, I, at one point, abandoned it because of how usual it is. But I returned to it in a few months after.One of my worries are also being about the tracks, although there's 42 tracks at most, the other 21 is  just mirrored.Last one is about one of the mechanics: The Casino. Chances are in a race, you could get a crappy thing, but a really good one is actually rare. I.E. The useless Nitro is often, but the best ones, like Titanium Frame or Stunt Nitro is almost impossible.FINAL THOUGHTS:To be honest, I love the game, it has alot of potential. But I wish that the developers could realise it. But then again, they might be working on something that could beat this. You should get it at full price, but if you take the problems seriously, then maybe at 20-40% off. I give it a 8.9/10			"

ProsThis game has tons of stuff to keep you busy withLots of different gametypes and eventsOn par, or even better than the Mario Kart seriesConsPersonally, I dislike the design of one track, especially on normal race eventsLack of tutorial. I had to look up on the internet for how to gain during and before the raceGraphicsThis game looks gorgeous. Overall very pretty and colorfulGameplayArcade racingTight and precise controlsFull controller support, which is great, even though the keyboard also works pretty goodEach racer has different stats, lots of playstyles to choose fromAudioCool soundtrack with lots of different tunesFinal ThoughtsHaving played many Mario Kart games, this was a huge surprise. This is THE PC Mario Kart. It can rival toe to toe with any Mario Kart game.The drifting reminded me of Playstation 2's Burnout games, which I loved, so I'm having a great time with this game. The controls while drifting are very responsive.Recommended! "

												This is one of the best kart racers I've ever played.   I'm not a huge kart racing game fan, but I've played all the classics like Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong Racing, and Double Dash.  This game is very much like combining all 3 of those games into one big package, while still mixing it up enough to have it's own feel.PROS-30+ Characters-Performance Customization for Karts-Several Gameplay Modes-Online & Local Multiplayer-Cheap DLCCONS-High Difficulty-GrindyGAMEPLAYYou transform your kart on the fly during races by going through transformation parts on the track, but you can also perform tricks that will give you a speed boost during transformations and also during any air time.  Go off a ramp, do a trick, get a boost.  If you fail the trick you will slow down.  Tricks are performed simply by flicking the Right Analog stick on the controller, and depending on the direction you will do different tricks.  Doing a certain trick at a specific moment can make or break your race.  E.G. Do a right flip, to move to the right in mid air so you can avoid a wall or a fall.There are several characters to choose from, each has their own strengths and weaknesses.  Sonic is one of the faster characters, but he has trouble turning while Amy has easy turns and acceleration but is not as fast.  You can also unlock up to 5 (6 total) mods for each character that will change up their stats.  Example, you can get a mod for Sonic that will lower his speed but increase his acceleration and turning.  This way you can play your favorite character on any track as long as you have the mod required for that character best suited for said track.  Mods are unlocked simply by playing your characters and leveling them up.  They earn experience for every race played, including in online matches.  There are lots of characters and this can actually feel like a grind but if you only play 1 or 2 characters it's fairly easy to max their level.  I haven't played very long but I have Sonic and Shadow both at max level.  The DLC characters automatically come at max level with all mods unlocked.There are several tracks to choose from, but most need to be unlocked in the campaign mode.  The campaign mode is a simple follow the path to unlock the next track.  You earn stars for each race you complete, and higher ranking races earn you more stars.  I recommend simply playing the highest rank at all times mostly because those stars are needed to progress.  You need to spend stars to unlock new characters, tracks, and certain mods.OVERALLAll in all, this game is great and if you are a Kart Racing fan you will definately want to pick this one up.  Don't bother getting the console version either since they are no longer supported by the devs.  PC version has more characters, tracks, and extra DLC.			"

												This game is awesome but be aware that it is not a mario kart clone if you are looking for that.It is a fun racer but items dont decide most races. They help if you are behind and sometimes get you from 2nd to 1st but its not a mayem as mario kart. Just as you might expect this game is FAST. It has the most awesome sense of speed I felt in a while (WHERE is a new Fzero goddamit) and flying and boating(?) is pretty fun too.It also looks incredibly (better than consoles by far ) on the PC besides having low spec requirements. It is a master piece and the best fun racer there is for the PC and probably one of the best splitscreen multiplayer games for the PC.It is really cheap nowerdays so just give it a try. It really is a great racer with lots of content.			"

												You might dismiss Sonic and the Car Stars in: Transformation Trouble because of the similar ability in Mariokart 7 to travel by air and water, but the transformation mecahnic is wildly different - the different modes have different handling and speed and in fact you have to remember to employ a completely different set of skills. Pulling stunts off static jumps for boosts when driving is simple compared to doing the same off sudden waves in the water, and entirely different to barrel-roll dodging obstacles for ""risk-boosts"" in the air. Super Sonicokart Bros. Transposed is built more around such racing skills than lucky pickups, in every sudden drop and every shortcut and every level 3 drift opportunity.My complaints with Sonic & Friends Magical Racetime Adventure 2 are mostly aesthetic. The character's victory animations and voice clips are boring and irrelevant. There is dialog that has been recycled out of context from existing games, and anything new is poorly voiced and sounds to be written as if after a cursory glance at the respective Wikipedia article. This is all in stark contrast with the lovingly crafted vehicle and especially course designs - with their ambient action and easter eggs - as well as the clever selection of amazing reimagined music. It also bugs me that the pickups aren't themed around Sega games, in what is otherwise a consistently nostalgasmic package.A more substantial complaint is that the control configuration is seperate from the proper game, and you might even think the defaults are confusing.Sonic & Pals Friendly Fun Time Xtreem Death Race 3000 deserves much more recognition. The spectacular set pieces, scripted terrain transformations, and hidden surprises in every course (capably delivered by the amazing graphic detail) make each race feel like a trip to Disneyland, and the gameplay is equally exciting and beautiful for all the same reasons. I hear the PC version isn't a sloppy port, but the best version of the game, running at 60fps to the consoles' 30. Play this game right now or live forever in shame and sorrow, laying awake each night wondering ""what could have been...?"".You know what's even stranger than Sonic in a car? Sonic losing a track event in the Olympics. If you want Sonic to COMPETE he has to drive, so stop whining about that.			"

												When I picked this up during a Steam sale I really didn't expect much. However I was pleasantly surprised with SONIC & ALL-STARS RACING TRANSFORMED.This arcade racer is a comfortable blend of Diddy Kong's Racing with classic Mario Kart. The different transformation of vehicles, racecar, boat, and plane, all feel unique yet fun, and the transformations feel seamless.Multiplayer is definitely the best part of the game, but you can still get a lot of enjoyment out of single player. There's a large roster of racers to choose from, and, for the most part, the multiplayer works rather well.The only major complaint I have on the game is its strange hit detection: more noticeable in online multiplayer, weird things happen when you collide with a racer, whether you collided with them intentionally or not. Sometimes I'll fly off the edge of the track or the racer I hit with an item won't lose any speed. It can be frustrating in those moments where a single second might mean the difference in winning or losing.Even so, I've already gotten a lot of mileage out of this racer, and highly recommend that you and your friends pick up SONIC & ALL-STARS RACING TRANSFORMED			"

ProsThis game has tons of stuff to keep you busy withLots of different gametypes and eventsOn par, or even better than the Mario Kart seriesConsPersonally, I dislike the design of one track, especially on normal race eventsLack of tutorial. I had to look up on the internet for how to gain during and before the raceGraphicsThis game looks gorgeous. Overall very pretty and colorfulGameplayArcade racingTight and precise controlsFull controller support, which is great, even though the keyboard also works pretty goodEach racer has different stats, lots of playstyles to choose fromAudioCool soundtrack with lots of different tunesFinal ThoughtsHaving played many Mario Kart games, this was a huge surprise. This is THE PC Mario Kart. It can rival toe to toe with any Mario Kart game.The drifting reminded me of Playstation 2's Burnout games, which I loved, so I'm having a great time with this game. The controls while drifting are very responsive.Recommended! "

												The Game itself is really fun! Im a HUGE sega fan...The Controls are a bit wonky if you dont have a xbox controller. I got this on sale for 4 dollars And to be honest I would pay full price (not really)lots of Iconic Sega Characters even some... not so sega characters like tf2.......The Maps Are Well designed and can be a challenge on the first run...The Only bad thing is when you dont have a controller the planes are WAY TOO hard to control.So Before Buying the game just buy a xbox controller... Just for safetyPros.-Great Graphics and Amazing shaders-Challenging, yet fun-Loads Of Characters And Powerups-Clever Gadgets on races-PLANES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "

												Surprisingly fun with a great sensation of speed and mobility.Compared to other games within the genre this one is way more dynamic and versitile as the maps change during the race, where there once was a road there now is ruins and you will have to use the plane to fly over it.The steering can feel a bit wierd before you calibrate the drifting and once youve gotten into it it feels real smooth			"

												Picked this up at a bargin under £5. I grew up playing the old Kart games especially on n64 so I was hoping this was a similar experience. Heard bad things about the original but this transformed version feels very complete. A strong Career mode with loads of unlockable characters. tracks and secrets. A very very high skill ceiling; the hard and expert difficulties are incredibly challenging and demand you master all the little tips and tricks you will discover while playing. The online community will eat you alive if you drop into matchmaking on first play. The game gives you incentive to unlock mods for your characters car as the more you use a certain racer the more mods you can use for that character. Racing, Battle mode, 1v1 elimination races, bonus style racing events (booster mode, rings and traffic mode are a nice take on the checkpoint style racing to mix things up)It has ran smooth for me at 60fps on highest settings, some really inventive tracks that nod back to mega drive/saturn/dreamcast days. (The house of the dead was my particular favourite.)It's pretty cheap and got a lot of replayability if you don't chuck the pad out of the window for some dirty scamp pipping you to a podium position with a well placed firework missile. Fuming.Enjoyed this one.			"

												A great game to pick up on sale but it is absolutely riddled with bugs. In general the maps and characters are quite diverse and interesting but be prepared to fall through the map, be taken from first place to last place thanks to the faulty catch-up system and enjoy watching your character get spawned back over open pits or in the wrong vehicle. Honestly not worth buying at full-price in its current state but would recommend getting a hold of it if you can get it during a sale.			"

												Firstly, far better than the first installment.Despite the awkward first impressions (character choices, in race battle items), this game is a very solid, fast paced, and charming racer. The difficulty can be quite steep so it is far from being purely a child's game.Use of references from sega's past will definitely give one or two AHA moments.Numerous game modes, difficulties and achievements will keep you entertained for quite a while.

												Vroom, vroom, here we go! Mario Kart 7!Oops, wrong game and wrong company. Oh hey look, Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing Transformed!Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (or SART for short) is the fourth installment in the Sonic & SEGA All-Stars series, which began with the mini-game based party game ""Sega Super Stars"". Obviously this game is a sequel to ""Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing"". This game was probably SEGA's response to Mario Kart 7, and they did a pretty good job of copying that game. It has the same 'transforming' concept of Mario Kart 7. In Mario Kart 7, you can turn into a glider, in this game you turn into a plane. In Mario Kart 7, you can turn into a submarine with wheels, in this game you turn into a boat. There are a lot of similarities between this game and Mario Kart 7, but I don't really care. This game does look a lot like a Mario Kart clone, but in all honesty, who gives a crap? This game may look like another Mario Kart clone, but it's a pretty dang good one.The gameplay is what you'd expect from a Mario Kart clone. Here's the entire Mario Kart-clone gameplay concept in a half-nutshell: drift to speed up, be a complete jerk with an overpowered power-up, give someone the Luigi Death Stare, boost like there's no tomorrow, win the race. That's pretty much it, but this game is special though, it's kind of hard to explain what makes this game special, but this game just is.All the characters and tracks are all widespread from different game series that SEGA owns, but in this PC version on Steam you get TF2 as a character, which is pretty cool. The only problem I have the character roster is that HATSUNE MIKU ISIN'T IN THIS GAME!!! WHY SEGA, WHY?!?!?! WE SIGNED THE PETITION BUT YOU WON'T HOLD UP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN YOU DAMN GREEDY PIGS!!! DXIf you have played the grand prix mode or had to select one of the many cups in some other game mode, you'll notice something. Each prix (or cup) has 4 races, but each prix (or cup) has a pattern, here it is: The first, second, and third race has a track with only two of the three vehicle modes, the fourth race has a track where you transform into all 3 modes. Kind of interesting, huh?  So you only get one or two tracks in an entire cup where you turn into a boat, plane, and car all in the same race.Once you master the game, the AI is very easy to defeat. The AI is smart, but not smart enough. Even the S AI (the hardest AI) is easy once you get the hang of it.The World Tour mode is EXTREMELY demanding, the special mini-game races (or whatever they're called) in the game have you do the craziest of things, like in some parts the game makes you race THROUGH TRAFFIC. The most annoying thing about the racing mini-games during the World Tour mode is the frickin' time limit. So you're telling me I have to do all this crazy crap ON A TIME LIMIT?! Time limits are something that could tick off any gamer, but this game takes time limits WAY too far. Time limits in video games never make any sense, but this one takes the confusion and frustration to a whole new level with its dreadfully short time limits. It might take you forever to complete a special race due to the damn time limit.The time limits are not the only thing that makes this game annoying.  The other difficulty blunder in this game is the Time Attack mode. You know what these are, right? Get the best time than anyone else. Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, sure, but um...Time Attack is kind of.....impossible to beat. The Hard AI for the time attack mode is UNSTOPABLE. I've tried countless times to get S rank on one of the tracks but the damn ghost wins every time. Please, Sumo Studios, let me beat your ghost once, ONCE!!!This game also has multiplayer modes, but I've haven't actually played any of them. SRY DUDEZ! Well, that's about it for this game. I guess I can close this  book on this review and go back to my life. This review is done. DONE, next game, next, next one, NEXT REVIEW PLEASE.6.8/10I have one last thing to say before I end this review. SOMEBODY PLEASE MAKE A MOD TO PUT MIKU IN THE GAME, PLEASE!!!! OR SEGA, MAKE DLC THAT PUTS HER IN THE GAME, PLEASE DUDEZ!!!! Please SEGA, put our beloved Hatsune Miku in this game. Please......... T_T			"

												Fantastic game for fans of kart racers. It has quite a high learning curve and is deceptively difficult so don't go into this thinking this will be an easy game. Don't let that put you off though as it is very rewarding improving your racing skills. Every vehicle feels different. I tried getting a couple of my friends who are huge Mario Kart fans to play. They liked the feel of the cars but not of the other vehicles due to unfamiliarity. If you're not willing to give the game a chance due to reasons like that then you won't enjoy it. Stick with it though and you will find a beautiful, and enjoyable racing game and the best alternative to Mario Kart that you will find. The netcode has some problems which does lower enjoyment somewhat but the online matches are still the most enjoyable part of the game. Racing against other players is way more fun than racing the computer. Dare I say that if the game was more polished it may have even taken the Mario Kart crown! Highly recommended!			"

												A very fun racing game, the graphics are fantastic and the maps are really well designed, heres why.You do the first lap, short and simple.The second lap changes, a route might be blocked by a monster or something.The final lap goes ape sh*t.I have never seen this in any racing game before, well I kinda saw this in Spongebob Squarepants and the creature from the Krusty Krab, but the races feel staged and are very easy.However the game does have a downside, and that's with it's keyboard controls....Now before I tell what I think of the controls, nearly everyone is fully aware that Keyboards are better at shooting games rather then driving, however after some practice you can become very well.Now usually it's WASD to control the car or move the mouse to where you want to go, but here, SHIFT of all keys is to accelerate! Why shift? Why not the W key, plus to move it's the arrow keys. Again, why not WASD? I'm used to Saint's Row and GTA's driving controls and they are much better, why change it so SHIFT is accelerate and the arrow keys are turning? At least your hands are wide apart for room, but I would perfered WASD to this.Overall this game is fantastic, controls are strange at first, but it's a very fun game.Also playing as the Spy from TF2 in a plane is the greatist thing ever! OH NO!			"

												This game is plainly awesome. It haves awesome characters Old-time Sega fans, Hardcore Sega fans, and even PC gamers can, and will recognize.It haves awesome, memorable soundtrack that's respective to the game the track is from.And the exclusive PC characters makes the game yet more fun. The game controls very well, and it's quite addictive and challenging.The game does have some bugs and glitches, but they're not game breaking; like for the WiiU, that NiGHTS is totally unplayable, and almost every Sonic character (Except for Eggman) crashes in Carrier Zone. (This doesn't happen on PC).Also playing Online is kindof a pain because you barely find anyone online, and when you do they're players who cheat the entire race and you barely catch up to them even with the Super Speed mod. So it's better to play with friends.But all and all, this is a must have game. I've had more fun with this game alone than with Mario Kart Double Dash, 7, & 8 together.You should really get this game. It's an underapretiated Sega gem.			"

												When it comes to kart racers, this game is among the best. In a time where 4-player local multiplayer games are few and far between (especially on PC), this game really is a stand-out. If you're a fan of Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing, you will love this game.Pros:-Controls are fluid and responsive, and landing the perfect drift feels very satisfying.-Graphics are very nice, though not spectacular. Tracks, characters and vehicles are colourful and vibrant.-Great variety when it comes to tracks, characters and gameplay modes. 100% completion will keep you busy for days.-4-player splitscreen, with the game allowing for the use of nearly any USB controller (we even use N64 controllers)!Cons:-Some races are VERY hard on higher difficulty, to the point of feeling cheap. Pretty sure the bots cheat.-No option to disable bots or items in any mode, despite the first game in the series having these options.-Occasional weird collision physics with terrain in some tracks.

												I gave this game an unfair shake when I first played it as I thought it controlled weird and I didn't care for a fair amount of the characters and the ones I do care about didn't make the cut (Ristar, Streets of Rage characters, Alien Storm characters etc) but I went back again recently and I apologise for dismissing it so quickly.This game is really damn good, better than some Mario Karts I would say. It has more than enough to hold you over regarding single player content. There's your typical grand prix cups and single races but you also have an ""adventure"" mode where you do different challenges to unlock different things. Some people might not like this and would prefer everything unlocked from the start but this does give you more incentive to play. There's also local multiplayer (which I haven't tried) and online which runs very well. This game is about 3 years old and people are still playing. I'm managing to get into full lobbies. In regards to the port job, this is a port of the 360 version as always but with graphics options and it also runs really well. Some would say this is the best way to play it (much like Gens PC)The only complaints I have are this game did not want to recognise my XB1 controller until I reinstalled the game (you can also use a program called x360ce but it's incredibly fiddly) which is weird as it worked the first time with the controller and again, I personally can't care for many of the characters (The only ones I like are Sonic characters, JSR characters and BD Joe from Crazy Taxi) but that's entirely subjective.If you want a solid, fun kart racer and have no intention of buying a Nintendo console or dusting off a PS1 for CTR, this is easily a great alternative and in some cases, a better one.

												For some reason, one of the best Kart Racers around - not just of the ones on PC. Surprisingly deep, amazingly difficult at times. Limited and fairly bland track selection aside, it's a total blast.			"

												If you like Mario Karts, but don't like the hassle of finding your wii controllers, and LOVE the idea of playing multiplayer with your friends on your very own screen, then this is the game for you.One thing I will say, is that it does not like weird monitor resolutions; I have a 27"" UltraWide monitor (2560x1080) and you won't even get to the menu, so I have to run the game in a more ""traditional"" resolution, but that's fine by me.On a positive note, my biggest problem with MK was that I never really knew where to go, but this game not only has MUCH larger indicators of upcoming turns but it also has brightly lit power-ups so you can see them ahead of time and plan your route accordingly.The inability to skip after-race-stats annoys me (I've been known to break things over inescapable cut-scenes) but I still had a blast with my daughter playing.So, plug in your spare 360 controller, load up and invite a friend. :)			"

												Bought it at steam winter sale 2015, and it's totally worth itThe main reason I recommend this game is because this game is not luck-based racing game, I also didn't find any weapon nor vehicles which is overpowered. Bots are given same advantages as us that made the game balanced.You can also find unique race tracks that some of them are changed in every lap, that made tracks in this games are different compared to the other racing games.It's also enjoyable to play it with keyboardThat's all and hope this review help you "

												Being a very oldschool sonic fan, i went into this with very low expectations simply because sega seems to enjoy doing horrible things to their greatest intellectual properties. That being said, this is actually a really fun little spectacle racer (and probably the closest thing we will get to a pc version of mario kart.... though the game is distinctly different from mario kart despite drawing very obvious influences from that series. In short, i has its own identity that comes through very well during play while still paying homage to its roots).The weapons you can pick up all for the most part feel rather intuitive and easy to use, though i do wish there was better variety to the available pickups.It is also very much worth noting that this game has some incredible race tracks. All of the karts have 3 modes (car, speedboat, and stuntplane), and they modes are managed automatically by what is appropriate for each section of track. This allows for some amazing variety in tracks, and they all take influence from various sega games over the years (the track for After Burner is particularly fun).i would definitely recommend this game for any kart racing fan (or anybody who just wants a kart racer, they can be really fun, especially with other people), and if you can pick it up for a reasonable price i would recommend it even if you arent a huge kart racer fan.

												This game is immensely entertaining. It's similar to Mario Kart, but as you level up the characters you unlock a lot of mods for your transforming vehicles to really customize how they handle. Using certain characters with certain mods gives strong advantages depending on which game mode and which map you're racing on. There's a lot of variety in the weapons, and you can use each in multiple ways. Game modes include typical kart racing with weapons, kart racing with no weapons, versus, sprint, drift challenge, boost challenge, ring race, battle royale deathmatch, and one where you have to blow up a giant tank without taking damage from fireballs and other obstacles. It's crazy.You start with a wide variety of characters and unlock many more as you play. Sega also adds new characters in updates pretty often. There are characters from Sonic games, Company of Heroes, Crazy Taxi, Football Manager, Nights into Dreams, Skies of Arcadia, Space Channel 5, Super Monkey Ball, Team Fortress 2, Total War, Wreck-It Ralph, and more. It's actually rather absurd how many different characters and vehicles there are! C class matches are a great way to learn the maps and controls. To win B class matches you need to start drifting. A class and Expert matches require a lot of fast thinking as you chain drifts with boosts and get to the shortcut routes. A class matches are very challenging for me. The online multiplayer community is full of dedicated, skilled Sonic fans, so even today there is no problem finding intense matches.			"

												Picking it up, i was expecting a run-of-the-mill kart racer. But it turned out to be far, far better. It manages to be both faster and less manic than the recent installments of mario kart, and its the better for it. The plane sections in particular are a lot of fun, and the music and track design is consistently good. Its not a masterpiece, but it sure is a fantastic game to play for sheer fun.			"

												At first I figured this would just be a bleh Mario Kart Clone, but after playing it for the last few days with friends, I've honestly come to the decision that it is arguably better than Mario Kart.Mario Kart loves to give the lower-placed players better items to 'equalize', including that oft-despised Blue Shell.  In this, the ""Blue Shell"" analogue is a swarm of bees.  The bees however do NOT guaranteed knock up the first place person.  They can dodge it if they pay attention/slow down, making it be less of a guaranteed ""HAHA GO TO SECOND PLACE""  This single change on its own is a great improvement over Mario Kart.The stages are just about at the right length to be fun, not long enough to drag on (I've yet to run into any Rainbow Road race that takes 20+ minutes and is just soul-crushingly bland once the prettiness factor wears off).  Changing vehicles definitely makes it fun as they all handle differently.  For folks who don't care about weapon powerups, there is Boost Mode, where all powerups are just boosts.  No shooting other players, just rely on your own skill.The racers seem to be decently different, but there are ways to modify them after playing as them long enough to shift their stats a bit, so if someone takes your precious Sonic, you can take another character and mod their vehicle up to have equivalent stats to Sonic's, given enough time with that char.Overall, if you grew up with a Sega and love arcade-style racing games, give this a try.

												Kind of impossible to not compare this to Mario Kart.Once you get past the questions ""Why the hell is sonic in a car?"", then you'll start having a great time.The rubber banding is almost no where to be seen, which is nice, I feel like I'm really owning some stages.The tracks are well designed and creative which helps to make the game feel fresh every time I want to have another 30 minute session. The local multiplayer is a god send, whenver I have a couple of friends over, we race it out to this fun game. The voice over (the guy who says ""Get ready! Go!"") can get a little too chatty sometimes which leads to small annoyances. The items system is similar to the Mario kart item system, however, it does have some different styles, such as a blowfish, ice attacks, and drones that follow the person in front of you.The delightful Car-Boat-Plane system reminds of Diddy Kong Racing, and the flying parts have some truly beautiful set pieces to race on.It's a great game, a worthy contender to the Mario Kart franchise. 8/10			"

												  If you like kart racers or fast paced arcade style racing games then this game is for you. In the golden days of quarters and pocket lint kids of all shapes, sizes and attitudes flocked to these ridiculous plastic racing chairs and dueled eachother in virtual races throwing all kinds of ridiculous objects at eachother. Easily the most memorable of these games is Mario Kart, yet this game does something that Mario Kart never did in all of its running. I enjoyed Mario Kart Wii, I loved Mario Kart 64. Yet in comparison to this game, it just doesn't hold a candle to it. This game tests your skill to quickly adapt, the tracks changes dramatically, giving new choke points and challenges to cut off and blast racers from multiple angles. This game practices a lot of the same things Mario Kart has, because its not broke so there's nothing to fix, but they adapt these things into the changes of the tracks flawlessly and it all feels perfect. I'm not the biggest fan of SEGA, except for a few of the non-sonic Dreamcast games. Yet, this game has a charm to it, that may very well make me like Sonic and all other SEGA icons.As a deathly loyal person to Nintendo (may not buy everything they make, but I do trust them as the last legitimate console makers in the world) This game has taken me over Mario Kart, and that says something.

												I was never into kart racing games. Even Mario Kart bored me a bit. Maybe I'm just biased against Mario, but this is a lot of fun. The car Transformations are fun, and the animations for them are neat to watch. Sadly, I noticed that a car often controls differently in it's various transformations, so a character that controlled well on the road suddenly feels more difficult to control as a boat or plane. Leveling your character by racing and gaining experience to unlock mods is another interesting feature I can't recall seeing in Mario Kart, and it's good for when your favorite character is lacking in their speed or handeling.The game certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to aesthetics, either. The lighting and track designs are gorgeous,  and the vehicle designs are diverse in all of their forms.One that bothers me though, is the PC exclusive characters, especially TF2 and General Winter. Who thought these were good additions for a game like this? General Winter in particular just...doesn't fit in, visually.Speaking of not fitting in, Shadow is extremely out of character and it's kind of disturbing.			"

												Great racing game, definitely worth every penny. You may think that this game is a rip off of Mario Kart, and you aren't exactly wrong, is it a bad thing that it's a rip off? Sumo Digital have got a game than many enjoy and refined it into a better game.. Sorta. It's only fun when you're good at it, otherwise it's just frustrating,+ Better than the first one+ More skill based, You can't just win because you got one good item... well.. most of the time..+ Good controls+ Wide variety of characters from loads of SEGA games+ 'Transforming' adds a fun new aspect to the game, makes it stand out from Mario Kart- Very frustrating when you start out, especially on harder difficulties. AI seem to only go for you.- Locked at 16:9 - No ingame graphics optionsNotes:Very few people play onlineSome of the achievements are stupid, I don't know three other people IRL who play this game. PC version is better than the console version, you can actually see infront of you and it runs at 60fps.Overall rating: 85/100			"

												Nice arcade racing game. Kinda reminds me of Asphalt 8 from iOS (stars for race completion, arcade drifting, boosters), but maybe all the arcade racings are like this, I haven't played them much.Played it on free weekend, maybe i'll buy it before the sale ends. Wouldn't buy it without the discount, though. The game is still repetitive and has primitive gameplay mechanics.I liked the leveldesign - bright, colorful and sort of psychedelic, loved the music and the character selection.Decent console port, except they haven't drawn the graphics for keyboard keys, so the key pictures in gameplay tips are still from the XBOX gamepad. You'll have to peek in configuration utility to see what keys you need to use.So pros - the game has nice look and feel, decent port from the console; cons - it's still simple arcade racing without any extra features (except for vehicle transformation, still not enough).I'll give it 7/10.

												This is probably the closest you can get to Mario Kart 8. That means that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is very good and enjoyable for the very same reasons as MK8. There are some differences:- Sonic offer a bit more sensation of pure speed on some courses and sections (It's Sonic, what did you expect?)- Flying is cool but can be tricky- Track design is not as thought–out- Weapons are slightly duller - The vending machines are not that great- Lower level of adrenaline and fewer moments of close but no cigar- NO BLUE SHELL OR EQUIVALENT! ^^			"

												As rather the opposite of a Sonic fan, I figured I'd try this game's predecessor, ""Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing"", and to my surprise it was a lot of fun.  It had a lot of similarities to the Mario Kart franchise, but it tweaked the things that didn't work and made it its own game, and I loved it.This game improves upon its previous iteration tremendously.  The execution of the vehicle transitions doesn't seem forced at all, and that along with the tracks actually changing and evolving during the course of each race makes each match an adventure that lasts just a few minutes.The weapons have changed greatly and no longer feel overly similar to standard Mario Kart fare.  Nearly everything is fresh and interesting, and the only guaranteed screw-yous have to be intentionally set up rather than simply fired.The controls are great, the online multiplayer works very well, and the characters are different enough to be easily recognizable at a glance.  Even the heads-up display is great.The only complaints that I have are that it's very graphically intensive, meaning that you'll likely have to drop your resolution a lot if you're running a fairly old video card; the announcer's trackside chatter is now practically gone; and new characters can only be unlocked in World Tour mode, rather than by simply playing the game and spending the resulting points.So yeah, while I do still rather dislike Sonic, I highly recommend this game for everyone who likes mascot racers.  It's a good deal at regular price, but if it ever goes on sale, JUMP ON THIS.  You won't regret it.			"

ReviewSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the new and improved follow up game to Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing. Transformed introduces online multiplayer, albeit a fairly buggy connection at times, a mode where you can play with friends in traditional racing or arena matches. Local split-screen mulitplayer is also an option for those that are interested.It's hard not to compare this game to Mario Kart, and Transformed is as close to Mario Kart as you can get on Steam (since you won't see any Nintendo games here). Transformed has the traditional Grand Prix, World Tour and Time Attack modes we are all accustomed with. Familiar item pickups are also present, including a sort of ""Ultimate"" move for each character. The animation, graphics, art style, gameplay and optimization are all extremely well done. and there isn't really a weak point to be found in this game.The karts are fairly customizable, and the driving mechanics are very fluid and polished. Drifting is smooth, allowing for extremely precise maneuverability. Transformed also employs water and air kart transformations in each level, changing up the style of the race, much like the newer Mario Karts. With so much similarity, it's hard not to like the game, assuming you liked Mario Kart at all. ScoreSonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is truly THE kart racer to get on Steam.Masterpiece- 10/10			"

												This game is a really good competitor to Mario Kart. The game's got great music, cool levels, nice graphics and nice gameplay. Don't be afraid by the game's title, this is not a Sonic game at all. The PC version is a very good looking port and it runs great for most computers.Before you ask, yes, you should buy it. This game has become my favorite racing game, and that's saying something. I recommend the PC version because it's much cheaper and overall it's a much smoother experience. I got this game for my Wii U and the 30 FPS cap is not that satisfying.I give this game a score of 5/5. Buy it if you like Mario Kart!			"

												A friend of mine suggested this game, I was dismissive at first of course, it's Sonic, it's a kids franchise. But having read other reviews and watched some gameplay videos (and also being 50% in the Summer Sale) we went in on the 4 pack and got it for a very cheap price (also bagging the Outrun DLC). All I can say is, what a superb, fun game. A mixture of Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing with a few other elements thrown in. Great graphics, well optimized engine (locked at 60fps), up to 10 players in online multiplayer. I don't think I've laughed and grinned so much since I played Super Mario Kart of the SNES back in the day and it brought me back to the days when I actually enjoyed playing for once. Highly recommended.			"

												A great racing/karting game. You get to play as many of the most famous SEGA characters including Ulala, Shogun, Nights and ofcourse Sonic & friends + some guest stars like Ralph from Wreck it Ralph movie or Team fortress dudes. But probably the most interesting and entertaining thing is the transformer-like nature of the cars which can transform to speedboats or jets depending on the situation on the track which usually changes with each lap so you end up running a pretty much different track in the last lap than you were running in the first one! In addition to racing you also get a lot of various challenges and unlockables and achievements so it's definitely worth buying. Don't be mislead by the fact it's a children friendly game, it gets very challenging on harder difficulties and in harder challenges.			"

												Perhaps one of the best overall racing games that I've ever played, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is easily the best kart racing game that I've ever played. Mario Kart is commonly seen as the 'best' for this genre, but where as Mario Kart lets even the unskilled players win with last-place-powerups they get, Transformed instead still gives it's best powerups most commonly to the slowest racers, but makes them able to be dodged by the most skilled players. No Blue Shell stupidity here. The tracks are all fun to race around, and the transforming vehicles turn this from 'just a great racing game' to 'one of the best'.  The car, boat, and jet all control radically different, and are all fun. The tracks 'transform' as well, most of them changing every lap to accomidate more the whole 'transforming vehicles' thing. Every music track is a joy, wonderful remixes of classic Sega themes, and the tracks themselves follow a broad stretch of Sega franchises. Except Phantasy Star, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it, Sega.The online play is probably the best part, as the netcode works perfectly fine, and, last I tried, there was a pretty healthy community of players.  It's extremely unfortunate how many people avoid playing this gem simply because ""I don't like Sonic."" Anyone who even slightly likes this genre should love this game.			"

												This is probably the best Mario Kart / Crash Team Racing -like game on PC, no doubt, but it has so many flaws that I can't recommend it to competetive gamers. I'll break them into sections.GraphicsThe screenshots on the store page look kind of good, but even with max settings, the character models are horrible, maps are ugly and low res and it doesn't really have all that much of eyecandy like in the screenshots. Plus, more often than not, the maps glitch and sometimes essential objects are missing, like the track you're supposed to drive on. YMMV (your mileage may vary) though.Game ModesThis is actually the best part of the game, the offline content. It took me and my gf over 20 hours to play through the main mode 100%, before we moved to Grand Prix. Main reason why it took so long was probably that it wasn't quick to become good at this game and we never moved on to the next track unless we beat the last on the highest difficulty. This is also how I recommend playing the game, otherwise it's probably too easy. It doesn't matter which of the human players wins the race and that makes this game highly cooperative.Online MatchmakingI've only read that the skill rating is brutal and connection issues are everywhere, which makes your rating drop if you drop out of a match. I tried to play this game online, but never found a match, so in my case the online game is dead. Again, YMMV. I wouldn't buy this game to play online, unless you get a good deal for a 4 pack or something with your friends.DrivingThe most important aspect of any racing game is how the controls work or how the cars (and planes and boats) handle. In car mode, it's quite okay and highly rewarding to combo boosts to get faster. But this is also where the game falls flat. The stats that the cars have are way inbalanced. Pick one of the most overpowered characters (like Gum or Alex Kidd) and you have an easy game, even in the highest difficulty. But if you have a favorite character and it has multiple handicaps stat-wise, good luck. Some of the maps and A.I. require near god-like performance to beat, plus the A.I. cheats. I'll write more about A.I. later. Now, there are the plane and boat -modes too. Plane is okay, fastest of the three, but not really fun or challenging. You can air drift and try to cut corners, but otherwise this is the most boring of the modes. You can easily land shots even with the aim dependant weapons, the drones and wasps really f♥♥k the A.I. up in plane mode and it's just... boring. Plus some of the maps have invisible walls, so you need to take the long route even if you could easily just fly straight to your destination, because there are no obstacles. Not really annoying as it's so rare, but a ""feature"" none the less.Boats... God I hate boats. Turning with a boat feels like you're playing with a 200ms lag. Plus you often overdo it, because turning just a bit feels like it's doing nothing. Then you overcompensate it to the other direction and you're head first at a wall, losing precious seconds and getting last. You can learn how to play with boats, but that takes a bit of the character variety out of the game, because if you learn how to do it with one character, the next might perform differently. Plus some of the maps just have the most ridiculous unfun water parts that you'll just be glad when you've beaten the map.CharactersThere are a lot of characters in this game, didn't bother to count them, but unlocking them makes the offline modes rewarding. Now one of the biggest cons in this game is how the basic stats of some characters are just irreparably underpowered. High handling is mostly useless beyond level 3 and some of the characters have like lvl 4+ handling and that is compensated with a slower car. It's ok in Drift challenges and maybe Ring Races, but in regular Races it's a recipe for last place.If the first 2 stats (speed and acceleration) are low on the character, you might try to level them up and fix it with mods, but often it doesn't do enough. I understand that most of the variety in character comes from their stats, but it just makes some of the maps unforgivably hard in higher difficulties. Though, when you get better at the game, you can beat most maps with any character, like I did in my replay. I started over and only picked random characters for each race and didn't have problems. But sometimes you get Amigo for a Sprint race (beat the A.I.s best lap time) and you're in for a bad time. Overall, not a big con, any other game has better and worse characters, so it's just basic game design.Some of the characters are just annoying and badly mixed voicelines break the immersion. Don't get the Yogscast DLC or you'll hate him everytime you play against him. Shadow and Joe Musashi (?) speak with their radio voice and that doesn't really fit in the sound design. That's a small annoyance, but one nevertheless. And don't bother playing bad with A.G.E.S because he'll comment every crash and burn like it's your fault, which might be true but god, does he need to turn the knife in the wound? :DGlitchesThese need their own section. Bugs and glitches are so abundant in this game, that it's the main reason the game has turned into a swear-fest for me. It is just too frustrating having to restart a race over and over again, because either your character is prone to physics glitches (randomly getting flown up in the air, the car doesn't turn because it is considered being in the air etc.) or the map is glitchy. And none of these will ever be fixed for this version of the game. The last update was that Ryo character in 2014. So if you're getting this game, consider it glitchy from the get go. The maps are glitchy and the characters are glitchy. If you combine the two, you're in for a restart-fest. Otherwise you need to play the map all the way to the end and start again anyway. That is, if you want to unlock it all, like I do.A.I.In lower difficulties the A.I. is super easy and slow, but in the harder difficulties expect to get hit from all sides with all kinds of weapons that makes you lose precious seconds. It's in the game design, yeah, but the A.I. isn't really fair in the first place. It would be ok, if the A.I. was affected by the same bugs as you, but no. They get overpowered boosts, they fly through tricky and tight corners with ease and sometimes they get so far ahead it's impossible to catch up. Start button, restart, choose difficulty, smash A will become a mantra when playing this game. You'll restart so often for the tiniest reasons just because the A.I. does stuff you can't counterplay. Sometimes they target you as a group and that means you will want to restart, again and again.Map DesignMostly it's ok and fun, but the haunted house map is an example of annoying map design. 90 degree turns after a high jump? Doesn't really play well with the high speed feel of the game, having to slow down. Some maps have routes that are just super annoying and once you learn them you'll never go there again. Like the snowy map, you'll never want to go via the high route because it's one of the glitchiest parts of the map. Anyways, you'll have your favorites and pet peeves.ConclusionI don't know why I bothered to write such a long review for a 5€ game that is actually most of the time fun. The fun just gets undone if you don't get bored of the game before unlocking everything. The game becomes frustrating with all the issues and unfairness of the A.I. that will never be fixed. Without them, this would be near perfect kart racer for PC but we're left with an abandoned port that works with casual gamers. If Steam had other options than recommending a game, I'd happily give it something in between. With stars it would probably be something like 3/5.			"

												Suppose i'll be the first to review in the open, i'm going to be a sport and say 4/5.It's a well presented game that is really well optimised.Real go getter for avid sonic fans, the soundtracks are very true so sonic of our spined friend's original days.Controls are a breeze, lovely colourful backgrounds and variation in gameplay that will keep you on you're toes, there's unlockables and achievements to be had based on player skill and lots of challenges for the player to attempt, a large selection of alternative game modes and above all else, it's fun.If you buy this one, i would have to say that if you don't quite get onboard with being hit with a rocket when you're in the lead, might be best going for another one, but as far as competive racing games go, i like it.Graphics : 4/5Great designs on maps although, visually nice to see, however, the wave textures are a little sloppy and at times they can interfere with control, though this is something that isn't that much of a problem.Sound : 4/5Decent, stereo sound tracks that display a little creativity on some original work of the previous sonic games, voice cast is those of familiar faces.Gameplay : 3/5Only discernable letdown is that there isn't an option for online grad prix modes, though there is plenty of room for exploration and a mountain of power-ups to gain the upper hand in races, help text is also shown between loading screens that will inform newcomers to a set weapon's function, over all a decently balanced expierience.

												Finally... after all this time, a really, really, really decent Sonic game. Ok, maybe not in the traditional sense, but man, is this game fun ! There's a lot of variety in tracks, there are multiple routes to take, racers to level up, characters to unlock, stickers to collect and so much more. And then there's the transforming of your vehicle. You'll transform (next to your kart) into a plane and boat on the fly. It's a great idea and gives the game much more dynamic. It's the kart racer PC games always wanted (true, Blur was great too), no doubt.The graphics are colorful and sharp, the sounds are ok-ish, the music is very good and wow, the game actually supports my Xbox controller out of the box. I remember previous Sonic games having trouble with this.It also runs at 60FPS and never dips below. It's a great PC port for a great price.Only downside - and please note that it's only a small one - is this silly/annoying announcer, which Sega uses for pretty much all their own games. He sounds a bit corny in this day and age. And to be honest, I expected something better on that front.This game is just excellent and deservers your money if you're into arcade racers ! The campaign mode will also last you quite a while so you don't need any friends to have fun ;)Get it ![Rating: 87/100]			"

												Great game!- you can play for hours or play for one race because it's that easy to pick up and play.- it is by far the best Kart Racer on the PC and the best I have played in years. Comprehensive character list and level selection.- there are many hours of playtime in the game too, I'm at 40 hours and haven't even launched an online match yet!- the game is the perfect ""party game"". I'm a gamer yet my non-gamer partner has no trouble picking this up and going.Worth it at default price, worth it even more during the inevitable 75% off Xmas discount on Steam. In saying that, if you don't want to wait a month you'll get your moneys worth from the game right now.			"

I thought ""Hey, i'll play to see how bad this game is"" And now this is one of my favourite games of all time. Do not make the mistake I made of ignoring this game just because of ""Sonic"" on the cover, because this by far beats mario kart and allot of other racing / karting games.Also the graphics and optimization are amazing, the performance is smooth and stutter free, and the visuals are crisp, clean and beautiful. The soundtrack is also amazing. Words can not express how much I love this game.			"

The controls are ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, but if you can work past that (or use a controller) it is superb. i recommend a buy, there are always cheap deals outside of steam for a key. Resembles old N64 mario kart style of game play, which i love.Thank you ck0101 and Team 7200 for introducing me to this game.and a very big thank you to GP_BEARD for gifting me it. i shall not forget it, sir.

												Honestly, this game is just fantastic. A lot harder than Mario Kart, but once you learn how to drive and pull off sick tricks, it's a blast. I'd recommend this to any fan of Sonic, SEGA, Kart racing or those who want a challenge.			"

												In this case it is the only viable alternative to Mario Kart for play on Steam.It is a fantastic game, and meets and exceeds expectations for a game of this category. You can play with boats, planes and cars. That is the perfect game to play with friends online and offline. Includes split screen for play on the same screen with your friends. This game will give you hours and hours of fun.Note: 9/10			"

In addition there is a leveling system to modify your favorite racers stats. I still don’t get what stickers are for though.  "

												One thing which has always bugged me about Mariokart is the sense of speed. In that regard, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed completely trumps the franchise. It's fair to say that Mariokart finally has a serious contender on market and Sonic might've even surpassed the latest MK entry with All-Stars Racing Transformed. Here's hoping this franchise will last for many more years to come as I haven't had this much fun with a Kart racing game in quite some time. Go Sonic!			"

												I got this as part of a Sonic Bundle from GreenManGaming, and its the game I have played the most so far from the list. Its one of the most addicting racing games I have played in a long time. Not to mention the inclusion of Team Fortress racer (Spy as plane, Heavy as boat, and Pyro as car) Shogun from Total War franchise and the manager from Football Manager franchise with the PC version. I was tempted to buy this game for the Wii U since I played the demo, and it was a blast. It was worth the wait to get the superior version of the game. The single player GP and World Tour modes have plenty of content to keep you busy for awhile, while the game's offline and online multiplayer capabilities make this an awesome one system racer, and fun game for all ages and players. This game may not seem like it would be worth buying, but it's SEGA, which have made many successful arcade racing games. With the popular IPs that SEGA has combined with their signature addictive racing gameplay, it makes for a fun and hectic time.			"

												The game is beautiful, first of all. It is so colorful, and I enjoy playing it. However, there are things you must know before purchasing.1) You need a gamepad: Don't even think about playing this game with a keyboard and mouse. It is easy to configure the gamepad once you get to the configuration page OUTSIDE of the game.2) Glitchy: Some areas will count as off the road, even when you're on the road. Controlling the automobiles are a pain. 3) Read a guide: This game doesn't tell you about gaining boost during the start of the game, how to change directions while drifting, and anything else I forget. You have to read a guide if you want to get through the game. But the guides won't be long.4) Finish Grand Prix mode first: Dr. Robotnik is probably one of the easiest cars to maneuver, since it's so small and very fast. Unlock him to have him at your disposal during the mission mode.			"

												This is overall an amazing title. Quite possibly the best current gen kart racing game. The graphics are stunning, tracks are well made and not cliche. A healthy variety ofgame modes as well as unlockables to entice further gameplay. Splitscreen capablewhich is a plus. Only problem I've had is a few game crashes, but fortunately has onlybeen while loading, and NOT in a race. Breakdown: 7/10There was no tutorial, had to learn through trial and error. Also a few crashes. But a very solid hit. A game anyone can play and enjoy.EDIT (6/15/2014)S class difficulty can be more trouble than it's worth, it seems like the AI is scripted to harm you with weapons vs other AI, be it you are behind them or front. You are unable to make a single mistake if you wish to win on S class, not ot mention being hit by weapons over 3x can make it impossible to win unless you are able ot take a shortcut (not on every map) or get All-Star mode			"

												It's ♥♥♥♥in Mario kart for PC. Because Nintendo hates porting titles this is likely the closest thing we'll ever get. I don't have much to say as this essentially is the same thing except with flying and.. sailing? While Sailing is pretty much the same thing as driving and flying is a bit diffiuclt to get used to but has some fun parts. Anyways, if you ever liked Mario Kart this is essentially the same thing, perhaps a bit better. The game has a SEVERE lack of weapons though. Assuming you don't unlock weapons somehow it's a tad bit of a letdown. Got it for 7.50, the amount of levels is great for that price, just again, wish there were more weapons and more interesting ones. If Nintendo is going to remain console exclusive then I gotta give the props the SEGA here. They made a great game and haven't forgotten us. It even comes with splitscreen, a feature many PC games lack. Personally I doubt I'll see myself playing this online much, it's never interested me, so I'd price the game at around 15-20 dollars. But for people who want an online experience you can probably get a lot more out of this. 8.3/10			"

												This is the best arcade style racing game that I have ever played. Even surpassing Mario Kart, which is also a supreme game title and very popular. Sega really pulled it off on this game, as they did with Sonic Generations. They just need to keep up the pace. I give this game a 9 out of 10. In the online ranked mode sometimes (not common but not rare either) you'll find a boost exploiter, or straight up cheater playing in the lobby. You can just avoid matchmaking if they pop up in your lobby though. Sega should ban them permanently from playing. That's my only complaint, is running into cheaters every now and then.			"

												I'm loving this so far, only playing as Tails cause I love Tails.MechanicsPretty nice, easy to use although I do suggest a controller for this unless you're used to racing games on a keyboard, the driving, flying, and boating mechanics feel pretty flawless but they also still give that feel of a classic arcade racer in a way without being as annoying and rage inducing.Graphics & SoundsThe graphics are awesome, the voice acting is decent, and the music is nice, not much else I can say.GameplayBasically a standard racing game with power-ups, laps, different environments, and many different game modes to choose from.OverallI got this game originally on my old phone but it was dreadful using a touch screen and not wanting to drag a bluetooth controller everywhere with me I decided to get it on Steam and I'm enjoying myself quite a bit.Only issue I have is ALT+Tabbing out and the game crashing while I'm ALT+Tabbed.

												I got this as part of a Sonic Bundle from GreenManGaming, and its the game I have played the most so far from the list. Its one of the most addicting racing games I have played in a long time. Not to mention the inclusion of Team Fortress racer (Spy as plane, Heavy as boat, and Pyro as car) Shogun from Total War franchise and the manager from Football Manager franchise with the PC version. I was tempted to buy this game for the Wii U since I played the demo, and it was a blast. It was worth the wait to get the superior version of the game. The single player GP and World Tour modes have plenty of content to keep you busy for awhile, while the game's offline and online multiplayer capabilities make this an awesome one system racer, and fun game for all ages and players. This game may not seem like it would be worth buying, but it's SEGA, which have made many successful arcade racing games. With the popular IPs that SEGA has combined with their signature addictive racing gameplay, it makes for a fun and hectic time.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a damn fine kart racing game and definitely one of the best ones to come out. The controls are really good, the characters feel different from each other, there's little to no rubberbanding and the game feels like it offers enough event variety and reasons to keep playing. The music is also really good here. The weapon selection is also pretty good. There is no blue shell or warp orb equivalent in this game that would discourage the players from keeping the first place too long.The developer SUMO Digital really knew how to make a solid kart game. The tracks are well made, they play different and you really need to learn how to drift and boost to win in this game. Not knowing this some go online saying that the game is way too hard way too early. This is only true because the didn't learn the controls. Although the game does play faster than your average kart game because after all it does star Sonic. The game doesn't really get hard until later on when you start going for those expert rankings or if you plan to 100% the game. That's when the game really expects perfection from the player.Now on the down side the roster could've used some work. I actually wish this game could've been called Sega All-Stars rather than Sonic & All-Stars. The PC version has 27 characters with seven of them being from Sonic and the rest being from other Sega titles with a few exceptions. To me characters like Amy, Shadow and Knuckles felt like a bit too much of the same thing. Also there a few odd and out of place characters like Dana Patrick and Ralph. Also Ralph is really annoying with his lines in this game. Instead of the ones I mentioned I would've like to have seen characters like Billy Hatcher, Ryo Hazuki and Akira Yuki who are featured here, but aren't playable. Also it's a bit weird for an OutRun course to be DLC in a racing game. Not only that but the track is really underwhelming and you can't play it online. Other tracks do a lot better with their source material.But biggest problem with this game is how long it takes to start, end or restart anything. It's how the menus are made. It takes them too long to animate and you can't use them until the animation is finished. With a game as hard and fast paced as this being able to quickly restart a race should be a given. Also the announcer really shouldn't talk as much as he does in the menus. Also you can't leave the game open in a menu screen because every 30 seconds the announcer tells you to do something.But look past all the nitpicks you have the best kart game this generation.			"

												One thing which has always bugged me about Mariokart is the sense of speed. In that regard, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed completely trumps the franchise. It's fair to say that Mariokart finally has a serious contender on market and Sonic might've even surpassed the latest MK entry with All-Stars Racing Transformed. Here's hoping this franchise will last for many more years to come as I haven't had this much fun with a Kart racing game in quite some time. Go Sonic!			"

												I was always a fan of Mario Kart, every other ""Kart Racer"" that came out seemed to be just a knockoff which was never much good. The first SASASR was a ""Kart"" game. At first I avoided it as I was playing Mario Kart Wii at the time. When I got round to playing sasasr I was shocked as it blew MKW out of the water. It was faster had missions and was genrally more fun. When this came out I bought it straight away on the PS3. This is an ""Arcade racer"" as opposed to a ""kart racer"" so it handles totally different to its predecessor. This game is fantastic its so much faster than Sassar and makes that feel slow. This has loads of  challenges and fantastic levels. The levels come alive and terraform during the race. The Skies of Arcadia map starts off with ground air and boat, but by the end of the second lap the Sky Pirates invade have a massive fight and blow most of the circuit away turning it into a air only circuit. I currently have about 98% complete on the PS3 the final time trails are so hard so I dont think I will ever get the 100%! I was also within the top 100 on the championship standing at one point. I Would recommend this game to anyone who like racing games that are more on the fun side!			"

												Surprisingly enjoyable game with a wide selection of cars and good handling for keyboard gameplay.  The plane mode is slightly fiddly without analogue controls, but you can pick up a gamepad for <£5 but you're still getting the full experience cheaper than on console, and that's if you don't have a gamepad already.  There are very few games that I enjoy so much that I play them regularly for an extended period of time, and this is one of them.  Game is easy to learn, and hard to master.  Options for different classes and different stats on cars which cater to certain skill levels allows you to choose your own difficulty curve and rewards you for it.  Online, the game is fairly balanced, and every car and mod has a good use both on and offline.  The game actually has a competent rating system, which judging by the wierd numbers I seem to gain or lose every match is actually calculated based on quite a lot of things including the ratings of the other players.  I can't put my finger on why I love this game so much.  Is it the mechanical complexity that rewards skill?  The satisfaction of chaining together a level 6 boost and passing 3 people in the process?  The skillshots that belong in MLG montages?  Either way, a SEGA casual karting game frankly has no right to be good.  And it is good.  Really ♥♥♥♥ing good.			"

												Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed may seem like a bit of a childish or bad game, due to the title - but do not be fooled. It is one of the best games I've played, and I will be sure to sink more hours into it.GAMEPLAY The gameplay in this game is crazy - you switch throughout levels to different cars, planes and boats. Remember, this happens in the same level; so you could have been driving one second, but the next, a piece of the cliff had fallen off and suddenly you're in the air, flying. Due to this, I will be splitting the next section of the review into different parts.CAR HANDLING The cars feel decent - not the best, but for an arcade racer, it does the job pretty well. I don't really have much to criticise, as all cars are different but there are no major flaws with the handling of the cars.  They feel mildly satisifying to drive, but I would say that the camera shake does make the game feel like it has frame drops.PLANE HANDLINGThe planes in this game are amazing. They feel so smooth, and refined that you will almost always look forward to the plane sections of a level. Mixed with the visuals, they provide a very nice touch to the game that I haven't seen before - although Mario Kart 7 + 8 does have similar sections, ala gliding. BOAT HANDLINGNot too shabby, I have to say. Boats can be tricky to get right, but this game has done a damn good job of it. It doesn't make you feel frustrated as the glide of the boats are easy to learn and also feel very light. In my opinion this is good, and it makes the transitions feel very nice as well. GRAPHICSThe graphics in this game are phenomenal - especially for a game with such a cartoonish atmosphere. It looks amazing at 1080p and I'm sure it will look even better at high resolutions - although on my 1080p monitor I couldn't get the game to run at 4K for some reason. Optimisation is decent, but I believe that the frame rate is locked to 60, which is a shame, especially for those of you with 144HZ monitors.LEVELSThe levels are well done, and feel amazingly detailed compared to what I've played recently. I can blow up parts of the map with powerups, and they will let me get to a shortcut or past an obstacle if I was about to crash, and that makes me smile as it truly feels like the developers have thought about their consumers.MODESI have not had a chance to delve into the multiplayer, but the Grand Prix mode is very nice, although the 3 laps can get a little boring. Still, I like that mode a lot more than the world tour mode. I feel like the World Tour could have been so much more, but that is just me. Single race is, well, a single race, and I believe the game has 4 player split screen - BUT don't quote me on that. OVERALLThis game is very nicely done, with lots of intricate details and decent optimisation. It's visuals are very pretty to look at, as well as it's cars and characters being detailed. The gameplay is a breath of fresh air from the pile of garbage that game developers seem to class as games these days. I would recommend it, especially on a sale. 8/10.			"

Wow. This game is really something special. I grew up on various kart racers, and this is so fresh yet so familiar. It is a joy to play on the bigscreen with a controller. On one hand, it is a cover of MarioKart, but yet on the other hand, it is very fresh and brings much more to the table. The problem with MarioKart is that it has not really aged all that well since the early 90's (IMO). Yes, it is still fun, but it needed to be overhauled - which is exactly what was done here.Pros:1. Wide range of difficulty from super easy to rage-quit-difficult.2. So many modes and tracks that the playtime hours stack up quickly.3. Awesome array of playable race characters ranging from Team Fortress to the Sonic Family and more.4. Tracks are video-game themed which is kick♥♥♥♥♥5. Graphics and sound are pretty great too.6. Meta-game character leveling up (something MarioKart should take notes on).7. There are still 3 laps, but usually in most tracks, each lap is different - your vehicle converts transformer-style into a boat, plane, and kart.Cons:1. The powerup concepts are borrowed heavily from MarioKart, yet are *slightly* underpowered. This meant that in MarioKart, it was anyones race pretty much up until the finish, which does not seem the case here. This basically translates to Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed requiring a bit more skill (if you will) to win any given race. This could be good or bad depending on how you look at it). I think I prefer the more random elements of MarioKart especially when playing with a group of friends with mixed skills/experience with Kart games.Overall, this game is totally worth full price in my opinion, and you certainly will not hear me say that often for a twenty dollar title.

												I unfortunately can't get into Mario Kart anymore since the ""Mario Party"" design philosophy of handicaps and handouts has invaded the item system so thoroughly. But I am happy to find that Sonic All Stars Racing is a modern kart racer that maintains a lot of the things I loved about the Mario Kart games without all the Mario Party everybody-is-a-winner welfare gimmicks.Here is a list of comparisons that I think highlight which game is better than the other in which areas. You may or may not agree.Short version: Mario Kart destroys Sonic in charm, but Sonic is a better racer. Choose Mario for a more artistic, more cohesive, and more atmospheric racing experience. Choose Sonic if you want to actually enjoy driving.QUALITY OF TRACK AESTHETIC:Mario Kart 8 is the clear winner. Much more creative, vibrant, and fun-looking tracks.CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:Both games have some customization, but MK8 is better here, allowing you to choose your vehicle model and exchange individual parts. Sonic only allows you to choose ""mods"" which are just preset stat configurations but don't change your vehicle appearance in any way.CHARACTER/RACER QUALITY:Suffice to say, Nintendo has a much longer list of memorable characters with tremendous pedigree. Plus the characters in Mario Kart feel COHESIVE, which is to say they all FEEL LIKE they are part of the same universe and should be in the same game together. In comparison, the character options in Sonic All-Stars Racing are pretty underwhelming. The characters don't have the same pedigree, they have completely inconsistent art styles, and there is virtually no cohesion whatsoever--i.e. most of the characters don't feel like they should be in the same game together at all. It's just a random hodge-podge of characters from all over the place, many of which you may not have heard of and probably don't care about. It's weird that Sonic characters are racing next to Team Fortress 2 characters. Even weirder is when REAL race car drivers (e.g. Danica Patrick) start showing up. Just... a weird mix. But I love racing the classic Sonic characters.OPPONENTS USING ATTACK ITEMS THAT HOME IN ON YOU AND ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO SHAKE/AVOID:Mario Kart 8: There are multiple items like this and you get hit by them constantly (this is where a lot of the frustrating Mario Party-esque handicaps and handouts come from).Sonic: There are multiple items that have some degree of homing or aim-correction, but all homing attacks allow the *possibility* of avoiding them completely, e.g. by drifting around a sharp turn or around a solid object to make the incoming threat crash, or by firing your own attack items backward to neutralize the threat directly. Mario Kart used to be pretty good about letting skilled drivers pull off these types of exciting escapes, but more recent Mario Karts are more interested in handicapping skilled racers and giving welfare to less skilled racers. Sonic has a certain amount of balancing (as all racers do), but it still allows skilled racers to finish a race miles ahead of the competition if they are good enough.CAN SPEED BOOST BY PERFORMING STUNTS/TRICKS:Both games technically have this, but it is a lot more satisfying in Sonic. MK8 pretty much just has you press the jump/hop button to perform a standard trick, but in Sonic you can flick the right joystick to front flip, back flip, or barrel roll. And of course the barrel roll can also be used to avoid obstacles/attacks sometimes (especially during flying sections), which is always exciting.CAN SPEED BOOST BY DRIFTING:Both games allow you to do it, but the drifting feels better in Sonic. It just feels better to control. Also, even though the Sonic tracks aren't as charming as the MK tracks, they provide you with TONS more stunt and drift opportunities.SECRET SHORTCUTS & SIDEPATHSBoth games have these in equally satisfying amounts. That's in terms of quantity anyway. Bear in mind that Mario Kart tracks are more visually striking/creative, and the same goes here, but the Sonic tracks are not bad at all.VEHICLE TRANSFORMATIONS:Both games have the racers travel over all kinds of terrain: land, water, and air. But in Mario Kart it's mostly just terrain. In Sonic, your vehicle actually literally transforms between car, boat, and plane. Each of these forms of your vehicle controls completely differently and has to contend with completely different physics. The boat racing in particular can be very challenging--especially when racing across choppy water full of whirlpools and huge waves, etc. Sonic also has much more exciting flying sections, IMO. Lots of fly-through opportunities for daring flyers. And dat barrel roll.TRANSFORMING TRACKS:Sonic wins here. The tracks themselves transform as you race on them. There are a few tracks that are static through the whole race, but many tracks will change in some way. Either part of the track will get destroyed and then you'll drive off the end and transform into a plane, or a huge spaceship will land on the track, forcing all racers to drive inside/through it, and other such transformations. Some transformations are cooler than others, but the good ones are very fun.EMPHASIS ON COMBOS:Here is where Sonic really shines. Both Sonic and Mario Kart force you to use boosting if you want to stand any sort of chance against more advanced racers. However, I think Sonic does a better job of stringing together long chains of boost and stunt opportunities, letting you set up a huge combo chains. Since there are more types of stunts, mid-race vehicle transformations, and mid-race changes in the track itself, these combo chains can be very exciting. Sonic also makes it possible for you to FAIL your stunts if you execute them at the wrong time, so there is always an element of tension when you've got a good combo going. If you are a really good racer in Sonic, you can sometimes boost almost non-stop through an entire race.MINI-GAMES ETC:Mario Kart used to have battle mode, which was a huge selling point. For some reason they decided to get rid of it. Mario Kart 8 doesn't really have much in the way of other activities as a result, which is too bad.Sonic All-Stars Racing also does not have a battle mode, but if you select ""world tour"", there are some other racing activities you can do, such as drifting challenges and boosting challenges. I am personally a big fan of the TRAFFIC challenges, which fills one of the game's tracks with hundreds of other cars and tasks you with making good time while avoiding any crashes. (There are even police cars that try to ram directly into you!) Mario Kart would have posed a huge challenge if it still had battle mode, but with the absence of battle mode, Sonic's other driving activities win here.RUBBER BANDING:All racing games do it. MK8 and Sonic both do it. But I have to admit, even though Sonic is not as cheap as MK8 with items, it can be VERY cheap with the rubber banding on the A class races.OVERALL:Mario Kart has established itself as a kart racer that puts all racers on relatively equal ground, regardless of skill level. This is great for a group of friends with relatively equal skill level, but can be frustrating or even infuriating for skilled players who are held back by all of the constant handicaps.Sonic is not as good as Mario Kart in a number of ways, but it manages to be a fun kart racer that is very similar to Mario Kart, but it has more to offer players who want to win on account of driving skill and who are growing weary of Mario Kart's penchant for handicaps and handouts.

												This game was a tough decision to buy since I really don't like Sonic, ut I really enjoyed it anyway despite it's mascot. It's not a Mariokart spinoff in the slightest, and brings a lot on fun and creative elements to the table. And on top of it, the charachters have been very well balanced in terms of stats. My only problem with this game is the PC controls hat make it hard to steer my plane or throw items. I say if you want a fun game to play with a buddy, get this!			"

												I didn't play too many racin games to I don't really know what to say about it, but it's pretty fun and has enough depth to gain a certain amount of skill for it to not get boring or too dependant on stats and items? Probably?what i'm not too hype about is the hit detection, though. Like, the 3rd even where you have to shoot the tank, the rockets really love exploding into the ground before making contact with either the tank or its projectiles, even in a straight path. not sure if it was just that level, but sheeeeeesh.also, I know handling matters for a reason during aerial segments, but getting stuck into an invisible wall near edges is never too fun, especially when it's in a relatively slim hole you're supposed to fit in.otherwise the rest is functional and fun, I think.definitely worth gettin if it's on sale or in a bundle, though I have no clue how alive the online is.

Forget the childish arcade style of Mario Kart and Mod Nation Racers, this game puts the others to shame with its Top of The Line car physics system and its newly implemented ""Real Air Turbulence Module"" GET THIS GAME. However, don't bother getting it if you are looking for a family friendly game you can play with friends, this game is the real deal. I would highly reccomend it to the die hard race simulator crowd.

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is racing at its finest-- its absolute finest. One could even say it surpasses Mario Kart! The game looks stunning and preforms almost completely without flaw. The characters are well balanced even if stats say otherwise. As an example, B.D. Joe has a high speed advantage, yet Amigo has a major speed disadvantage, but his acceleration and boost can bring him to first place if you know what to do. The tracks are filled with sega references and fill an old-school sega nerd's heart with joy. They're all fair and fun to race through on the ground, in the water, or even in the air. Whether you play alone or with friends-- it's all fun regardless. There are tons of missions to play through on easy, medium, or hard difficulties. Once you beat the game, you unlock an expert difficulty to really challenge yourself again! The game doesn't dry up fast at all; it's constantly keeping you racing. It doesn't matter if you're pro Nintendo or pro Sega, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is undeniably the best racing game to date.			"

												Oh, where to begin with this game? Oh, I know; it's brilliant! While the model quality for most characters is rather poor (I'm looking at you, Sonic and Ralph) and the stock clips can be irrelevant a lot of the time, the true appeal in this game lies where it matters; the game play, especially in online mode. For hours on end you will find yourself racing head to head with up to ten friends, which can become highly competitive and addicting on many an occassion. Unlike the recent Mario Kart installments, your online race won't be ruined by an item similar to a spiny blue winged ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Instead, the items are fairly balanced (though I'd like to see a way to build up the All Star in future games) and the only item you can find yourself really getting frustrated at is the triple ice shot as it freezes you on contact. If you can live with mediaocre stock clips and alright character models (the environments themselves are overwhelming), I'd highly recommend this game on its online value alone.			"

												SASRT  (=Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed) might be a Mario Kart clone, but that doesn't stop it from blowing the original out of the water.Where Mario Kart games can really feel like they're mostly based on luck, SASRT is mostly  based on skill, even though you can still get a good item that would help you get the upperhand, but even then, you'll still have to use it wisely and have the skill to do so, or it will be completely useless.Where Mario Kart games' races can feel pretty uninspired, SASRT's races are a pretty great demonstration of intelligent level-design. Every single inch of the races are calculated to reward you if you're doing good and punish you if you screw up.Where Mario Kart games pace can feel  boring, SART's pace will barely allow you some time to blink.Where Mario kart games single-player will gladly leave you the  first place in any race on any difficulty setting and make sure the closest opponent stays a mile away from you, SASRT's AI will rather hunt you down and take you out like there's a billion dollars bounty on your headAnd don't get me wrong, I love Mario kart, especially Double Dash on gamecube. But Sega's SASRT is just so good it makes Mario Kart games looks like they're the SASRT clones.			"

												This game is amazing! I don't have a whole lot of experience with the PC version (but I have around 60 hours in the 3ds version), but I think it is the best Sonic game out there. There is an expansive roster of characters with some excellent DLC and stunning and gorgeous tracks. There are a ton of achievements to be unlocked and fun to be had. An excellent buy for anyone!

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a joyous, colorful and pretty unique kart racing game that features a large number of characters and tracks mostly from various Sega games. Naturally, Sonic is the star here, but there are other characters here as well some of which you wouldn’t expect in this kind of game. The Steam version features additional characters from Team Fortress 2, Football Manager, Company of Heroes 2, Shogun: Total War and Total War: Rome II.The most unique concept that the game offers is right there in the title. Every car automatically transforms into a boat or a plane at different parts of the track. Not only that, but most tracks change from lap to lap as well. This makes the racing very dynamic, unpredictable and varied. The controls feels good, but they get more and more demanding as you change difficulty levels as the game automatically disables certain assists. Both casual and hardcore players can get the most out Transformed as you can change the difficulty at any time and enjoy the game at your own pace.Transformed doesn’t have a classic campaign, but it rather offers a World Tour consisting of a slightly non-linear series of a wide variety of events including classic races, battle races, versus, boost/drift/checkpoint challenges, and so on. This mode will unlock characters, tracks and mods. Mods let you slightly customize your vehicle in a very limited way. Each mod has a series of predetermined parameters which change up the ratios between speed, acceleration, boost, handling, etc. Apart from World Tour, there’s also Grand Prix which lets players compete in five tournament cups and time trial, single race and multiplayer.The graphics are great, the game is colorful and bright, each track is completely different both in its look and design. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is pretty much what you would expect from a game like this (or any Sega game, to be honest) – horribly cheerful retro synth and guitar melodies. Thankfully, it blends in well and you won’t notice it much at all.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does what it sets out to do very well. It’s simple and joyous yet challenging and skillful. The gameplay is fast and fun, the track design is varied and imaginative and there are plenty of modes that will keep you entertained for a long time.7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)			"

												I really didn't expect much from this game, thinking it was just a Mario Kart rip-off... but how wrong I was. The game is AWESOME!!! I was right about it being a rip-off, but it's a great one at it. The gameplay is great, as well as the graphics and the sounds. If there's a flaw, that would be the characters. The only ones I care about are those from the Sonic franchise.			"

												Blows Mario Kart out of the water.It's called Sonic and All-Stars, but in reality this is a SEGA racing game featuring loads of characters from iconic games like Sonic, Space Channel 5, Crazy Taxi, Super Monkeyball, pretty much anything SEGA has ever made including stuff I hadn't even heard of, you'll race on tracks with themes like Golden Axe, Outrun, Afterburner, House of the Dead, you name it.A lot of the tracks change for different laps, like Sky Sanctuary falling apart forcing the racers to fly, or ships crashing on the Skies of Arcadia level. The game is running on CryEngine meaning it looks spectacular. It's quite hard to find Kart games on PC (nobody mention Tux Racer), but this is a real gem. Technically it's very polished, full native 360 controller support, appropriate graphics options, amazing graphics, good music, it feels like SEGA poured a lot of love into this game. My only complaint is that I wish there was more weapon variety.			"

												Easily the most fun game EVER! This was most probably my first purchase outside Humble Bundle sales and the best one so far!The time I have racked up playing this game, just WOW! I haven't spent this much time on all other games in my list, combined!Its extremely addictive, and one can never get bored. The community support is awesome! The MP servers are never empty, and MP is smooth. Heck, Sonic boards are the only Steam discussions boards I'm active in. The developer still supports the game and actively replies in the discussions boards. There are many more DLCs and additional characters planned for the game, so you'll probably never get bored of this! ^_^Overall 10/10!			"

												Online is a disconnect from servers simulator. so many times have i actually been able to do good in a race just to be told there was a network error that kicks me offline. worse yet theres a penalty for leaving an online race on your rating off 100 points, which is the most you can make in a single race which you get by completing the race in first but only when your rating is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Speaking of the rating system, it's ridicolous. the higher the rating you have, the less points you get for completing an online race. getting first place eventually reduces that 100 points  you earn to low amounts such as only 4 points. an example is 1st place will get you from 1100 to 1200, but if you're at 1600 you'll get around 40 points instead.  you even get less points taken away if someone with a high rating wins the race and more taken away if someone with a low rating wins the race. making a rating system (which is useless in video games anyhow...) even more useless.singleplayer requires you to be absolutely perfect at everything to unlock everything (including mods for characters that change vehicle stats) and the AI, like many reviews have said, cheats. items are even more bizzarre this time around, looking to have absolutely no influence from any of the games that the characters you play as come from.flying and driving physics are ok but water section are horrible due to actual water physics (such at a tiny wave turning you into a small rock skipping on water). my one problem with flying is that inability to fire backwards, which you can only do by holding backwards which causes your vehicle to nose-dive or fly directly upward, depending on your controls.

The bad:-Weak characters. Although I'm far from unlocking the full set of characters in this game, the designs and vehicles go from okay (Tails, Wreck-it Ralph) to curious (Alex Kidd, Ryo) to friggin' awesome (Metal Sonic, Knuckles), to weak (Team Fortress) and finally to absolutely baffling. Football Manager, The *TWO* Total War characters and General Winter feel incredibly out of place and in the case of the last one, are kinda cringeworthy to drive while hearing WW2-era Soviet slogans and choral music when activating the special. And that's a shame, because I feel some of the designs are pretty neat but could have been way better if they had been designed as original themed characters instead of weak plug-ins for games that just don't belong in this game. I'm going to ignore Yogscast because it's the only thing that deserves, and only going to comment on the fact that it's kind of the sign that Sega really didn't care about making iconic, enduring, compelling characters opting instead for the founder of a podcast that not only has a history of publisher extortion, is an ugly and annoying turd in a box racer.Come on, Sega. You have way more franchises to take characters from than selling the spots in your game to the highest bidder. where's the OutRun car? Daytona USA?? Any of the Virtua games!? Golden Axe and House of the Dead could have been used for more than a track, and if we get into multi-platform characters there's a plethora from which to choose, from Sparkster to James Pond. Friggin' Battletoads. I could go all day. Tons of characters whose developers I'm sure would chip in to see fan interest in those properties renewed.Somewhat iffy controls on certain flips but especially when it comes to firing weapons. Plane sections require you to press up and down, which is also used to choose to fire in front or behind your vehicle. I would have preferred only shooting backwards when looking backwards, but that's more an annoyance than an actual issue.Nice tracks, but could be better, especially regarding the Sonic themed ones. They are pretty and nice, but with some notable exceptions like the Samba de Amigo or certain parts in the Nights levels, don't leave a very lasting impression.The good:Very tight handling and physics, that, although annoying sometimes if you get stuck, make sense and play fair. The game also has certain permissivity on roads that have no guards, letting you leave the track for a very brief moment and correct if you're fast enough. Flying sections feel especially alright.Very good  weapon system that allows to escape homing projectiles, neutralize attacks and choose how many and in what direction to fire your weapons. No blue shells to be found in this game.Challenging AI and demanding circuits that make clearing level A tracks an actual feat. Although difficulty seems pretty uneven letting you dominate certain circuits while sweating for every inch on others, you'll more than likely find yourself fighting teeth and nails over a position.Good variety of modes, including not just a grand prix option, but a progressive career as well, where you can unlock characters and advance through branching paths that offer different challenges.Splitscreen as well as online multiplayer.Versatility in characters, thanks to the unlockable mods for the cars that will emphasize some aspects of the vehicles, making possible to specialize a character in an area suited to your needs.Great music and sounds. For the most part. See ""annoying turd in a box racer"".My closing thoughts would be that this is a very pretty, very fun to play game that, although suffers of some really friggin' weird design choices, has a very solid core underneath, with some really cool vehicles and tracks. If you can ignore those, this is money well spent on a very fun racing game. I'd give it an 8/10.			"

Posted: April 23, 2015
 A game that potentially could have been truly great, marred by unpolished controls and lousy game mechanics I wish Steam had a neutral rating or sideways thumb because I would have picked that for this game. It's not a bad game but I don't consider it great either. It's a very decent game but with some significant flaws. I chose the thumbs down because I haven't seen any reviews that mention some of the glaring issues I find with this game. This is the most frustrating racer I've ever played in my life. The first major problem is the controls. Each of your vehicles (car, plane, boat) handle differently and they get progressively worse in that exact order. The car handles better than the plane and the plane handles better than the boat (by far).The car handles decently, but could have been tighter. The drifting seems to bug out occasionally.  I'll drift in one direction and then switch directions but my car still goes in the same direction even though I clearly pushed the thumbstick the opposite way. For the most part though it's solid driving. I found the cars to be the most enjoyable part of the game.The plane's controls are looser and more sensitive than the car's which means there's a greater chance of oversteering and flying wildly. I definitely feel less confident in a plane than in a car. But it's nothing compared to the boat, oh my god.The boat controls are absolutely awful. The worst I've experienced in any game. There is like input lag when steering the boat (to make it mimic a real boat I guess) but this inaccuracy makes you constantly over/under steer and it's very easy to go all over the place. After 40 hours of playing this game I still don't have solid control over it and still dread going into the water. I don't know why they made the boating so awkward.  This brings us to the second major problem: the game mechanics. More specifically the physics. When you are driving a car or boat and you get hit in the air by anything -- an opponent's weapon, the terrain, etc.,  your vehicle falls like it's in low gravity  (it also happens when going off a ramp/jump at a very slow speed). You will SLOWLY float down until you hit the ground or water, and depending on how high you are, can take FOREVER. This game has, without a doubt, the worst vehicle recovery time of any racing game I know of. It is not uncommon to take 3, 5, even 10 seconds to regain control because of the low grav or because your vehicle doesn't land properly after getting hit and you can't do anything about it. It really ruins the fast-paced nature of the game. If your boat goes off a ramp at a slow speed you can land in the water upside down and have to slowly wait till it flips upright. Sometimes you will float down on a rock and you can't move and gotta wiggle your way out. Or your car gets popped in the air by an enemy shot while driving uphill and your front wheels won't touch the ground; you are stuck there with your car standing on its rear end and the game doesn't respawn you. It's stupid and makes the game feel broken. Your vehicle should not drop in slow motion, should always land upright, and the game should automatically detect if you're stuck and then respawn you.Furthermore, when your car falls off the side it does not respawn you immediately. Your car has to travel for a certain distance in order for it to trigger the respawn. So if you drive off the edge at a very slow speed, you will slowly fly through the air until you reach that point where it triggers the respawn which can take extra seconds to do. Why they made it like that I don't know. The second you fall off it should trigger the animation so it always takes the same amount of time to respawn. Colliding with other cars is also extremely annoying because there's some wild bouncy physics going on. Simply getting nudged by another car can you send you flying off to the side. Sometimes hitting a car in front of you can make your car bounce backwards like 100 feet and come to a full stop! I've never played a racer where I was afraid to touch the other vehicle. It's something you just expect to do but in this game it can be unpredictable and you will consciously be avoiding contact with other cars. The exception is if you intentionally and forcefully bump them then you can be assured it will send them and not you veering off.The AI is brutal and awful and they will all pile on with attacks and bully you to no end. There is no invincibility after getting attacked like there was in the previous Sonic racer (Sonic and Sega All-Stars) so you can be in 1st place and get hit 5 times in a row and suddenly be last in the blink of an eye.The game's lack of polish is also noticeable by the inability to customize races in multiplayer. You can't change the number of laps. You can't enable or disable weapons or only allow certain types of weapons. At the end of a race the game randomly chooses 3 maps for everyone to vote on instead of letting you choose any map you want and many times one of the choices will be the map you just played. The game will randomly choose mirror track (which I HATE) which is a mirrored layout of the original map and you can't vote against it. There's no ready-up button in the lobby so everyone always has to wait the full minute before the game starts which is annoying. If you join while there's a game in progress you are stuck waiting forever in the lobby till it ends; why couldn't they let you spectate the other players? Or better yet, let you actually join and play and just not count the score to keep it fair. The game and the announcer will also routinely get your finished place wrong. The announcer will say you finished in 1st place when you didn't or the screen will show 1st place when you got 3rd.There's no free driving mode or practice mode in single player which is sorely needed in a game like this. You also can't change your controls in the game. You must exit the game entirely and enter a separate configuration menu.There is zero social interaction with other players. The voice chat is completely broken. All voices come through staticky and garbled whether you're in the lobby or in-game. There is no text chat in lobby or in-game. You might be thinking, who's going to have time to type while racing? You could type before the race starts, after you finish the race, or anytime you feel like it. The point is you should be able to chat in a multiplayer game. At the very least they could have put text chat in the lobby. The inability to communicate at all with other players doesn't make the multiplayer experience feel too different from playing against the AI.You also can't drive the wrong way (unlike the previous game). The second you try you get respawned. Now why would you want to drive the wrong way? Because it's always a fun and cool thing to do in racer games. If you're so far behind there's no chance of you catching up, you could say screw it and drive in the opposite direction to mess with the other players. Not in this game. My apologies for this long essay of a review. I wanted to be thorough in why I think this game is overrated and does not deserve the overwhelmingly positive rating. Because it's simply more frustrating than fun. You'll have tiny moments of enjoyment and the rest of the time you'll be screaming at your monitor wondering why the controls aren't responding the way you want or why it's taking so long to regain control of your vehicle. The game does have some nice levels to race on (and a few aggravating ones), the graphics are reasonably good, the music is catchy, and there's a decent assortment of characters to select. But those things don't make a good racer. It's the controls, mechanics, and gameplay that do. It's a damn shame because this game could have been really great -- a true contender to Mario Kart. But as it is now it feels like a pretty ok game that can be fairly rough around the edges.			"

												I played the 3DS version of this game for around 56 hours (with everything 100% achieved). While the PC version is reported to be the best one (actually the less worst one), it still shows absurd flaws that should not be present in what is supposed to be an AAA game from an AAA company like Sega. What is shown here is another rushed product.I agree that the essence, the core idea of the game is great and the tracks and mechanics too, but playing the PC version a bit is enough to show you that it's another port from XBox. Sega didn't even bother changing the button indicators, even if you switch the control to keyboard. Additionaly, game configurations are done.. out of the game, in a sepparate application you choose to open when you click the Play button on Steam. Controls, graphics and other configurations are all done in this application. If you want to change something while running the game, forget it. You'll need to close it before doing any other thing. To complete the list of observed problems, the controls configuration doesn't let you configure each sepparate key. Instead, it shows nothing and you have to figure what key does what by yourself.It's a shame for a company like Sega to publish such unfinished, rushed game like this one and if you want to spend your money in it, then go on. You really may like it and may not feel unconfortable with the problems it has, but it's a product I would not recommend to anyone.			"

												It is certainly no Mario Kart, but it is still fun, especially for Sega fans. Considering Sega can't usually port games to PC worth a fk, I am surprised this game runs as flawlessly as it does. Pretty good all around, although I would have liked to see a few better characters to race as. But then again, I haven't unlocked them all yet. The item pickups could use more variety or at least have had overall better pickups in the game. The pickups from even Mario Kart on SNES are better but then again that game is pretty hard to beat.Anyway it's a pretty fun combat racing game. 7.5/10.			"

												This game is a dissapointment to me especially after how much i enjoyed the first game let me explain why.The world tour mode is in my personal opinion Trash. the modes included in world tour can take alot of your time away from you especially the annoying presuit tank missions and the races where you can knock others out with just 3 hits because racing isnt enough especially as every single racer is after your head.The racing is more unrefined from the first game drifts are dodgey and send you completely off from where your going, you can no longer chain boost meaning i felt the game to be slower and i generally didnt enjoy the one thing this game was meant for.the specials of the game are dulled down versions and are in all honesty boring let alone carbon copy's of each otherhowever i do have this to say the game has a decent ammount of tracks and well designed ones at that its just a shame that the game didnt pull me in enough to careoh and the online is well put together and i didnt get too many problemsby all means im not telling anyone to avoid this game like the plauge im simple showing my personal gripes			"

												One of the best racing games I've played.Pros:+ Variety in game modes, stages, characters, powerups and music+ Great soundtrack+ Easy to learn/responsive controls for both keyboard and controllers+ Can be played in co-op online or locally+ Challenging end-game content and a good amount of content overall.+ Good for all ages!- Chilly Castle expert ghost and how your character is often forced to middle of a ramp leading to the last turn. With low handling and not being able to easily jump left from the ramp, it's very hard to fall down to the left, slow down, turn a bit and then use your boost. Even slightly hitting the wall at the wrong angle is enough to make you bump and lose to the expert ghost.- Achievements that require 4 local players.10/10			"

												A great sonic game, I hope to see more of the blue blur on pc in the future, lets hope some of the newer sonic games make it to.This game Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is mostly about racing transforming vehicles around many sega themed tracks, the game feels like an improvement over the other sega racing games and is most definitely a great addition to anyone's pc catalog. I grew up playing sonic games so I am acknowledging that this review may be biased, but if your a sonic fan you'll probably enjoy this game just as much as any other entry in the series.			"

												22/25 Gameplay8/10 Fairness8/10 Sound9/10 Graphics6/10 Controls20/20 Multiplayer14/15 Replayability ---87/100The biggest competitor of F1 Race Stars is currently Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed. Who will win the Kart race on PC?In Sonic & All Star Racing Transformed (shorter: SASRT) you are supposed to play single player to unlock more multiplayer. This means that you can play either ""Challenges"" (similar to usual Singleplayer in F1, but in F1 you do not unlock stuff) to unlock new roads or the campain where you have to win several kinds of races, but have multiple choices if you morely like this or that. But you can also do all. So it is up to you how much you want to play and if you want to choose a way to get a new character. For these you also need ""Stars"". You collect Stars by winning a race on easy (1 Star), medium (2 Stars) or Hard(3 Stars). Man, I love games with SO MANY UNLOCKS <3So you do not have to make the kinds of races that you do not like. And as their are many types of races (like normal, kill the others, boost, drive trough traffic etc.). But some of them are unfair- for me the traffic one.Another point why I just gave 8 points to ""Fairness"" is that you need good and powerful power-ups if you lay back in a race. In F1 you have these, not in Sonic though.The Sound is pretty nice, the Characters speak while driving but there is always some kind of childish dubstep which starts annoying after a time. Moreover the Sounds are always kept futuristic and sounds cheap sometimes. The Graphic itself is very good for a 1 year old game, but also: Everything is flashing, the houses next to the road are dancing...well- something for childs but not for me...The biggest lose in the points are the controls. A fun-racer with local split screen (which is awesome on PC) has to be easy to control to make it possible for your friends and family to be good at the game and to understand the controls. My Racing-Expert Friend just did not check how to get Power Start, Rolls, Boosts, Drifting and so on. And I did not check it in the beginning, too (which is not good). When we started playing F1 he instantly checked it all and was in the middle of the field.The Multiplayer is easy to set up and you can just do everything you want, as in F1 Race Stars. So 20/20 here.The game is pretty long, because of the many Singleplayer Stuff and the Multiplayer. It has like 20 hours on Singleplayer (or if you do 100% like...*cough* some *cough* people ;) also 60 hours ) and an active Multiplayer. It would get 15 Points, but I decided to take away one point for the hard Controls.So this is it!TL;DRIf you are looking for a Fun Kart Racer to play with family & friends sometimes - choose F1.If you are looking for a Fun Kart Racer to play Singleplayer or online - choose Sonic.

Many people may think this game is like Diddy Kong Racing, I'd say. Your Right to an extent. The characters in the game a lively and Fun. Great dynamic stages and on most all 3 forms are used. The game before this (Sonic All Stars Racing) Was a fun game but it had many flaws. I Feel that this game is great and is alot of fun.

												This is the best kart racer ever released period. Loads of karts, tons of characters to try out, and stages that are truly awesome to play through. Too many highlights to honestly write down in a single review. From Afterburner to Sonic and Panzer to Samba Di Amigo; someone will find something to love here. For me the Afterburner level was truly a great throwback and a beautiful level to boot. Of course, if you played the first Sonic game this one is more of the same, but with a polish not seen before. Land, air, and water racing have been added and they make a huge difference, giving this one a mellifluous fun factor not seen in too many kart games. The graphics have had a substantial update and everything seems like a general improvement to me.The game is compatible with Nvidia AA codes through Inspector, so you can get HBAO and downsampling to work; this is easily the definitive version this way. The consoles, when I played this on PS3, simply cannot compete with 4K and HBAO. The game just looks amazing and at a solid 60FPS too. I give the edge to Transformed versus its prequel, being that it added a wider variety of everything to the mix and the tracks are just insane. There are quite a few challenges like the first game and some secrets to find. The level variety is extremely varied as well. One of the all-time greats in gaming.			"

												This is the best kart racing game since Mario Kart Double Dash. The graphics, music, controls and overall fan service are all well represented. Driving the boats can be a bit of a pain and there are a few glitches that hinders it from reaching the same level of quality found in Nintendo's Mario Kart series. That aside I would say it's amazingly a lot of fun to play the single player campaign. Mario Kart falls miserably short in comparison in this regard. Also the variety of characters is just mind blowing. The PC version has the most characters available and more are on the way. Keep bringing the content Sega and I'll keep buying.Final verdict: Just buy the damn game! It's way too much fun to pass up!			"

												Hands down the best kart racer ever made. If you have ever enjoyed a game in the genre, you need to play this. Beautiful, vibrant, flawlessly balanced (none of that rubber banding or broken power ups like in Mario Kart), great course design, great sound design, great character selection, clever and memorable tracks, native 360 controller support. This is as close to a perfect arcade-style racer as you're ever going to get, and other than the minor annoyance of not being able to adjust graphical settings from within the game (there's a separate configuration program) it's a solid PC port as well.

												+ Challenging, skill-based gameplay+ Co-operative multiplayer for all modes; this includes grand prix, and the mission-based campaign, for example (local split-screen or online)- No windowed mode/windowed mode doesn't work- The character models are the worst looking part of this game- Vehicle and environment hitboxes are all over the place- The boat transformation is very clearly the most poorly programmed part of this game- Control inputs will not register randomly- It is unclear what actually counts as a ""risk-boost""- Single-race perks/bonuses are tied to a RNG slot machine, instead of a ""shop"", or ""upgrade"" system- AI racers will be ""balanced"" to have the same speed as you. So if you're Sonic, with the ""super speed mod"" (the ony character with this modification), the AI will still go faster than you in a straight runaway, whether or not they are properly utilizing the boost mechanic- If you are in a online match with nearly empty lobby, the game won't put in bots to fill out the room; there is no option to fix this			"

												On the surface, this looks like a generic Mario Kart rip-off starring lame Sonic characters. Actually play the game and you'll find it's a fast-paced, exacting racer. Despite the name, there are only 6 Sonic characters here. The remaining 20 or so come from all over the place, and some characters aren't even owned by Sega. Characters include Aiai from Super Monkey Ball, Wreck-It Ralph from that cool Disney movie, and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. The selection available is pretty crazy.The character and stage selection in this game takes a page out of the ""Super Smash Bros."" playbook: many obscure and retro Sega franchises make great appearences here. This is all on top of an arcade racing game that's much more interesting than recent Mario Kart games.The graphics are great, the transformation gameplay keeps things fresh, and the game is just downright fun to play. I thought the previous Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing game provided some stiff competition to Mario Kart. This one blows Mario Kart out of the water.			"

												This is legitimately one of the most enjoyable cart racing games i've ever played, I love Mario Kart 8 and i'm not the biggest fan of racing games, but man is this game enjoyable.Brings me back to the days of Diddy Kong Racing honestly, using air, water, and land to drive across great tracks all based around different themes, in this case that happens to be SEGA's rich history of characters and worldsGraphically the game is beautiful, the music as always is on point, the driving takes time to get used to depending on who you're playing as, the tracks, and the challenges but it all provides a welcome challenge.

												I never played the first Sonic Racing so i have no ground to compare this to the first game, but this is truly a fantastic kart racing game. Being an old fan of classic sega i was glad to see the variety of Sega's generally forgotten characters being included in the game, characters from Alex Kidd to people in Crazy Taxi, Shinobi to Shenmue. Just Brilliant. The range of tracks pay homage to old school classics like Golden Axe too!Nostalgia aside, the game plays really well and you really get a feeling of speed that i find is missing from Mario Kart. The drifting and air flips that attribute to your boost really give you incentive to memorize these tracks, tracks of which usually change a lot by the 3rd lap as the area usually destroys dismantles itself by the 3rd lap! This is where the main comparison to Mario Kart comes in...If you love Mario Kart you will proibably like this game and will probably get a lot of fun out of it, if you like the idea of Mario Kart but hate the same old guff and repetitive stuff, you really owe it to yourself to play this. You'll have a lot of fun!(The weapons ain't all that great most of the time, but the actual racing more than makes up for it)			"

												A very nice animated racing game for those who always liked the genre, great tracks, great music, and a nice crew of characters to pick from.The gamplay is easy to pick up for its simplicity, but as you go on playing, you discover there are some tricks to improve the general driving, like doing pirouettes on the air to boost up, finding shortcuts on the tracks, and mastering the items to attack other characters, and for those who seek a challenge, the time trials against developers' ""ghosts"" are really hard to complete. There's also an online mode where you can play with strangers or with friends, unfortunately, time has rendered online lobbies kinda lonely, and you'll find yourself waiting more than what you are willing to for a race that lasts barely a couple minutes, there's also local mode if you have several controllers.For those long time fans of SEGA, there are many references to previus titles, like Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, Wreck-it Ralph (oddly enough) and more; so it doesn't feel like just a re branding of a generic racing game, but as a part of the world this company has created over the years.The music is nice, upbeat and suits the levels, there's an anouncer with a very loud and over the top acting who will inform of the events during the races, it can be turned off for those who find it annoying, and each character has an unique song for their All Stars power, which makes it more enjoyable when you get to do it, and very frightening when you hear another player getting it.Overall, this is a very nice game to play either with friends or alone, it offers casual fun and big challenge as you progress, a perfect gift for a young kid and a completely non-shaming acquisition for a hardcore gamer fan of the genre			"

You can play with a DualShock or Xbox controller as well for a more classic feel. All the character have their own strengths and weaknesses. Each individual cart can be silghtly customized with mods changing the stats around but not necessarily making them more powerful. The mods just turn your cart to better fit your racing style.

												2fast4meGood graphics, gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from such an arcade racer. Powerups are either OP or useless (especially true against A or S class AI drivers), but by far the worst (or rather, most frustrating and controller-breaking) part of the game is the difficulty at high levels (especially A class). The entire AI field is against you, which makes the first item pickup feel very bad, time trials are absurdly hard and everything is made to make the game a pain in the butt to finish. Special points for the ""secret"" S-class difficulty, unlocked after half the game and which makes you go through half the game you've already beaten.Overall an extremely enjoyable game, but finishing it takes ages.

												Fairly fun game, though it's essentially just Mario Kart with different characters and different levels. Considering Mario Kart 8 introduced airborne parts of levels (though this game beat it to that) the similarities are still growing.The power ups are essentially the same (mushroom -> boost, banana -> blowfish, green shell -> firework, red shell -> drone and the swarm is pretty comparative to the blue shell). The tracks being riddled with crazy deathpits and booster pads really doesn't help the similarities, not to mention the easiest and best way to get ahead is drifting at every opportunity to get a boost.Otherwise? It's a fun game. It does what it's meant to, and there's a lot of offline things to keep just about anybody busy. The amount of unlockables is amazing for anyone really into the game, or really into collectables and the customization gameplay-wise is more than enough for anyone to find a nice play-style to fit their personal niche.Online play isn't exactly common though, often at times of the day there are 0 lobbies running to join, and I often found random disconnections in the middle of a game aren't fun. On the plus side, there was only often one game running so you'd soon be back in the next race with the same people.The inclusion of old classics is a very nice homage to the other things Sonic Team has created, as well.Overall: 8.5/10It's mario kart.. But sonic?			"

												An impressive needle in a haystack of crappy Sonic games, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is truly worthy of competing with other iconic racing games for the title of ""The Best One."" This game will make you laugh, this game will make you cry, this game will make you rage until there is no tomorrow, but most of all, this game is addicting!Screw all the jazzy intro speech, lets make a pros and cons list:*I didn't bother with Online play, so I can't give an honest review of that feature.Pros:-Graphics are pretty darn good! crisp and clear, water is fluid and reflective, and the sun is even blinding! This is a game that will blow you away visually if you just finished a Mario Kart 64 nostalgia run.-The music is wonderful. There isn't a single track that doesn't make me feel strange, and they all fit very well with the environment. Sound quality for SFX is great too.-Plenty of challenges, and the game kind of evolves with you! Several different modes that will test different skills you didn't think were required to do well in each map, like drifting and boosting, and even knowing when to use a boost in the right moment. It also keeps the gameplay fresh, and you have to option of having a game with or without computers.-Competitive AF. Coms really give you a run for your money in this game. There is no ""Easy"" way to beat the hardest parts of the game, and that keeps things... interesting to say the least! It also helps you to hone your skills, and learn from your mistakes.-Downloading ghosts allows you to compete with people worldwide without ever needing to battle them directly! This also helps to learn from their driving skills, and improve your skill pool.-Mods allow you to switch things up so you can use your favorite character on more than one track away from their standard stats. They also provide incentive for continued gameplay.-Achievements and stickers give OCD Completionists something to do, increasing gameplay time for much longer.-Stickers and License allow you to show off your achievements online, and can be a testament to your skill.-Plenty of unlockable characters, many whose names echo down the halls of SEGA, and some who are just plain ""WTF?"" (I'm looking at you Ralph... I still don't understand why you're in this game... not that it matters. I love you.)-Multiplayer option for local fun, just like mario kart seshes.Cons:-Content may seem redundant after a while, mainly I am thinking ""Complete the same task on a different course"" or ""OKAY now beat everything all over again but we'll just increase the difficulty,"" (this is after you unlock expert mode)-NO TUTORIAL!!! NO DESCRIPTION!!! REEEEEEEEEI had to Google what I couldn't figure out by fiddling with my controller, and there's no clear direction to help you understand the basics. The game literally just throws you in and you learn through experience. I'm still not entirely sure what the All-Star stat does, but my hunch is it determines just how amazing your All-Star ability is.-Hitboxes are irritatingly inconsistent, or just way too large. And this can work for or against you, but for someone like me who likes to drift as close to walls and around corners as I can, it sucks. Item boxes will sometimes be magnetized toward you, and sometimes you have to drive RIGHT down the MIDDLE of it to get the item. Sometimes, you will shoot a rocket or ice and think ""I really shouldn't have hit them..."" and sometimes Coms will hit you and you will rage ""THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE ♥♥♥♥ING HIT ME!!"" I have also squeezed my way through various narrows passages in plane mode, and other times I will hit what seems to be an invisible wall. Nothing makes me rage more than invisible walls... just kidding, the next thing is actually worse.-Coms are extremely OP in Expert mode. They have a handicap for all stats, so they will move faster than you, boost faster, they will get all-stars more often, and they seldom mess up on the map.-Coms will almost ALWAYS target you and only you, and in Gran Prix/Battle Race, it will very often feel more like 9vs.1 rather than a free for all. On expert mode, this becomes incredibly frustrating, because it is almost impossible to advance with people hitting you constantly. It forces you to play smart, and sometimes conservatively, or even recklessly... anything to win.-In this game, you ALWAYS start in last place, even in Gran Prix mode, which is kind of a slap in the face for traditional racing games. You ALWAYS have to fight your way to the top, and in no way can you earn a 1st place start.-All of the cons on Coms above lead into the next one: A lot of the time in expert mode, you need to rely on good luck to win, which is kind of a slap in the face to skilled players who truly know what they are doing, but are set up to lose. Even getting an All-Star is not a guaranteed win, and you will have to remain vigilant to hit those stripes first.-Some of the voice acting for this game is just... terrible... I haven't played as every character yet, but Shadow sounds like child with a pitch filter to make him sound lower and more ""evil"" I suppose.There may be more, but I can't think of anything right now.All in all, this game is like Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing, and Sonic Riders all mixed and refined into an amazing and diverse product. I may have listed a lot of cons, which may be intimidating, but I am also very critical, and maybe snotty. I am still having a lot of fun playing this game, as I have a LOT of stickers to earn still, and a lot of Time Trial ghosts to beat, and A LOT of mods to unlock. (Note to others, don't choose to be a completionist... it really sucks.)I'd give this game 8.3 out of 10. It's truly a wonderful experience, and it has it's flaws, but definitely worth the time.			"

												For some reason I'd avoided Sonic All Stars because I had vague memories of poor reviews; more fool me, as it turns out I was recalling the prior game in the series, which was nowhere near as polished as this one. Programmed by Sumo, who did the incredible PC conversion of Outrun 2006 Coast 2 Coast, this combines the same high level of graphical fidelity and the fun drifting mechanism of that game, with well balanced Mario Kart gameplay and a huge swathe of content, even if you don't get the optional DLC. Best of all, it supports local, split screen 4 player games, a rarity these days for PC, and even better, it allows you to take the 4 local players with you into online matches or anywhere you can reach in single player game, all with integrated team speak mapped to a controller. There are still people playing online, not a huge amount but it's still alive for now if you were thinking of getting this game...There are some minor problems of course; Like all Mario Kart games, weapons are still frustrating when you're in the lead and they're used against you. They aren't as wildly imbalanced as Mario Kart, but as the AI is rock hard and as only micro-seconds will seperate you from them, it still proves the decider. They're beatable, but often you'll find matches are won or lost on who got the random roll for better weapons.  Online skill shines through much, much more though and those who know the courses best and have the skills will race off into the distance.The single player has a huge range of content, which even 36 hours in I'm only just scratching; my profile says 60% complete, but that's just the Career and half the Grand Prix modes; Time Attack and Single Races remain untouched, and I've only dabbled in online play.  One frustration with Career though is that you'll run into non-race modes again and again on Career which halt your progress; whilst they do teach you vital skills (Holding Drift on corners to build up boost, hitting boosters to keep up speed, performing stunts to gain more boost) the challenges seem strangely placed so they break up the fun of racing, and can't be passed easily.  Don't hesitate to drop the challenge down to Easy just to pass them, but you'll need as many stars as you can possibly get to reach all the unlocks if you're a completionist.Also shame on Ferrari and their licensing for presumably denying the iconic OutRun Testarossa again; How many people I wonder grew up with those wonderful games and dreamt of a Ferrari; it was a remarkable piece of joint benefit for both brands. Now we get an ugly Daytona stock car replacement when we unlock the Ages character, and it's just not the same... Likewise it feels odd to see just how little of a roster of truly memorable characters All Stars seems to have. Surely we had more than Sonic and Alex Kidd over the years?  Where's Toejam and Earl, say? Licensing problems again maybe, but it does mean that the available characters are a strange mixture of cartoonish (monkeys throwing homing bananas) and super-deformed reality (General Winters from Company of Heroes 2 in a tank, submarine and Il-2 Sturmovik... eh?)  There's something for everyone I suppose, but it's hard to escape the feeling it's just 40% Sonic characters, 40% obscure punk ladies riding quad bikes, and 20% random fan service.  A small complaint, but it's there.But apart from these minor niggles, the gameplay is incredible, there's plenty to do, and the game is magnificently generous and fun in a way few PC games are these days. It truly brings together all the best of gaming past and present, the fun of being able to sit around one machine and dead arm each other to win dirtily, as well as online functionality with solid netcode.  If you're after a fantastic kart racer for your PC, look no further.			"

												I could write a novel about why this game is one of the best kart racers out that rivals Mario kart (You heard me!) This game has so much to do, here is a few of the many things:* Campaign mode with plenty of rewards and challanges (and legnthy one at that!)* Online multiplay with plenty of diffrent modes* Varying stages taking place in many different sega worlds* A huge cast of characters to unlock and level up as well as all being balanced meaning you can play as any one of them and win!These were a few of the things in this game and for the £14.99 priced you would be saving alot of money over the next mario kart, 10/10 Buy now!

												A very nice animated racing game for those who always liked the genre, great tracks, great music, and a nice crew of characters to pick from.The gamplay is easy to pick up for its simplicity, but as you go on playing, you discover there are some tricks to improve the general driving, like doing pirouettes on the air to boost up, finding shortcuts on the tracks, and mastering the items to attack other characters, and for those who seek a challenge, the time trials against developers' ""ghosts"" are really hard to complete. There's also an online mode where you can play with strangers or with friends, unfortunately, time has rendered online lobbies kinda lonely, and you'll find yourself waiting more than what you are willing to for a race that lasts barely a couple minutes, there's also local mode if you have several controllers.For those long time fans of SEGA, there are many references to previus titles, like Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, Wreck-it Ralph (oddly enough) and more; so it doesn't feel like just a re branding of a generic racing game, but as a part of the world this company has created over the years.The music is nice, upbeat and suits the levels, there's an anouncer with a very loud and over the top acting who will inform of the events during the races, it can be turned off for those who find it annoying, and each character has an unique song for their All Stars power, which makes it more enjoyable when you get to do it, and very frightening when you hear another player getting it.Overall, this is a very nice game to play either with friends or alone, it offers casual fun and big challenge as you progress, a perfect gift for a young kid and a completely non-shaming acquisition for a hardcore gamer fan of the genre			"

												After having accumulated 10 hours of gameplay on this wonderful take on Arcade racing, I can safely say that it's done everything right! I never played the original S&AAR, but while this may seem like an expansion for it, it has an innovative mechanic: the ability to drive (or fly) on land, sea and air, sometimes all in one race! To start, there are several Characters, namely ones like Sonic, but others too, like Joe Musashi from Shinobi. They all have different stats, and are best suited to personal preference. There are many you can unlock too! They all have unique sounds and quotes, and some of their cars are insanely awesome to look at!It has 4 levels of difficulty, the last being unlockable, and after you learn how to play efficently without crashing into walls or falling off, it does seem rather easy, even on hard. Expert is a real challenge, the AI can keep up with you in rather tense races. The track design is inspired by levels from various SEGA games (hence the 'All star), and they are very original ideas, with each lap (normally of 3 laps) changing the track itself! You can find yourself on a simple land track at first, but all of a sudden: the track retracts and you're on water! The actual transformations happen rather fast, but still cool.The single player consists of a 'Single race', which is 3 laps and not tournament based. Career, which sees you progress by earning stars and going through a path of races. That being said, the game offers many varients of racing, such as traffic challenges, drift challenges, Versus and more! The Career is a bit shortwinded, however. Of course, 100%-ing it will take a lot longer than I have played, but to get to the end itself doesn't take all that long. The idea is to progess through the different Cups, and you unlock characters on the way.For the cars (planes, boats etc), you can alter their attributes by levelling characters through an XP based system. You will unlock 'mods' for the Vehicles, which can, for example, improve Handling, but at a cost of speed. This is useful depending on what type of race/track you're on.The online seems to be dead, through no fault of the games, but no-one seems to play it, which is a huge shame as there is an Arena mode! That said, if you have family/friends, get them a controller (or keyboard if you're feeling like that) and play together! A controller is definetly superior for this game, more precise speed/accelaration and handling. I use a keyboard, and fortuneatly, you can rebind. You don't need the mouse for this which is cool.Finally, the Graphics in the game (at max) are beautiful! For some reason, my game locks itself at 55fps despite V-Sync being off. It is well optimised and a smooth experience and you don't need a monster PC to run it, not at all! Loading times are good, the menu and in game interface are well designed and easy to use.I think I covered everything, please comment if I left something out. Overall, 9.5/10!			"

												This is potentially the best kart racer ever made. It's a beautiful, fun and fast-paced game with great music, great characters, excellent race tracks and a unique gameplay concept. This is not just like any other kart racer, in this game you race with cars that turn into boats and airplanes in the middle of the race. These transformations are seamless and intuitive. All the vehicle types have their own unique handling, but at the same time feel similar enough to each other that it doesn't cause any disorientation. No matter which form you're driving, all the vehicles control perfectly. Rather unlike the luck-based whimsy of Mario Kart, the game is highly rewarding to skilled players; many of the items can be used strategically to attack or defend yourself from opponents' attacks, and there are even ways to evade attacks with homing items when one is unarmed. Snaking is not a terribly useful tactic in this game as it's very difficult to link multiple drifts across a straight. The game is more centered around thoughtful planning of boost charging and risk management.There is a huge variety of game modes and lots of single player content to enjoy. You can go through the World Tour to unlock new characters and tracks, or play through the Grand Prix for a more streamlined experience. There are also multiplayer battle arenas with their own modes such as deathmatch, king of the hill or capture the flag (or ""capture the chao"" in this case). The gameplay holds true to Sonic's namesake as the vehicles move quite fast and the PC version moves along at a perfectly smooth 60 FPS, although it can reach even higher framerates at times.There is a TON of Sega fanservice in this game, and you can telll the people who made this are really passionate about Sega's history. The characters and tracks are pulled from a large variety of Sega's franchises (such as Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, Space Channel 5, Crazy Taxi, NiGHTs, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe and even Skies of Arcadia). On top of that there are many interesting guest characters in the game, such as Wreck-It Ralph from the Disney movie of the same name, and Danica Patrick, whom Sega is sponsoring in NASCAR. Not only that but the PC version gets several exclusive characters such as General Winter from Company of Heroes II, the Shogun from Total War: Shogun, Willemus from Total War: Rome II, and the Team Fortress 2 guys. More DLC characters are on the way as well, as Ryo Hazuki from Shenmue is already available to purchase from the store. If you fancy yourself a fan of racing games, or just fun lighthearted multiplayer games in general, you will do yourself a great favor by picking this up.			"

												An arcade racer featuring various Sonic and SEGA characters from classic and current games. 7/10, although I don't know who most of the characters are.It has a few mechanics from Mario Kart. 7/10 not necessarily a bad thing, because there are no blue shells. Instead you have swarms, bees that will line up in front of the guy in first place and they CAN be avoided. The other items are a LITTLE reminescent of Mario Kart, and there is at least a major difference between MK and All Stars RacingIt has boats and planes. This adds a different challenge to each map, some having boats planes and cars, or just having cars/boats or cars/planes. They also control fairly well in my opinion. 9/10Soundtrack is FANTASTIC. 8/10It has Football Manager as a character. 99/10 would listen to British accent again. Also no bugs regarding FM for once.Fantastic game.			"

												Unlike other kart racing games sucess here is entirely down to your own ability.You can counter every powerup with a correctly timed manouver.The weapons all feel fair and nothing is over powering...unless Eggman gets his all-star. Ai does not cheat. It really does not, once you learn a course and dust an expert Ai it will never catch you again.The only issue is jet mode makes most weapons useless. However you can catch boosts off everything as the jet.I wish it got more support from Sega since the game is just a blast.			"

The characters are from sega games and the levels are designed after the games aswell. The game even has leveling up characters similiar to an RPG. I found my self grinding my favorite levels and playing on hard mode just to level up new characters. The graphics rival that of Mario Kart 8, which came out after this game. I would give this game a 9/10.			"

												Hello, everyone. Welcome to my review for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. Here, I will be reviewing each seperate part. Lets start with the World Tour mode.The World Tour mode is essentially a line of 10 (except for Sunshine Coast) races, with two characters (again, except for Sunshine Coast). You earn stars based on what mode you do and if you complete the challenge, and to unlock every character, you have to earn these stars. Doing it on Easy gives you one star, doing it on Medium gives you two, doing it on Hard gives you three, and doing it on Expert gives you four. This is how you unlock most of the characters, except for one... Lets talk about that.The Grand Prix mode is 5 cups, containing the game's 20 (21 if you buy Metal Sonic & Outrun Bay) races. The cups are in this order: Dragon Cup, Rogue Cup, Emerald Cup, Arcade Cup, and Classic Cup. But wait, theres more.  If you finish each cup, you can unlock the mirrored versions of each cup. Finishing these unlocks you Dr. Eggman. So, lets talk about the cast.You have Sonic & his friends, AiAi and MeeMee, Beat, and plenty more. Want to be a part of the past? Choose AGES. Want a unique car? Wreck-It Ralph has you covered. Do you even want to play unarguably the most annoying character?! That would be the Yogscast! (even if I don't find him annoying, just good stats and annoy others that find him annoying even though you can play NiGHTS with the EXACT SAME STATS BUT BEARABLE TO LISTEN TO! Gee, its almost as if they dont WANT you to spend extra money on their game... oh wait, Metal Sonic and Ryo.)Now, we should talk about multiplayer.Multiplayer is really good, actually. You can play with any character you have, even if you cant get back in first if you get hit by... anything, really. Its fun.Overall, I give S&ASRT a 'Yogscast has been eliminated!'/ten.			"

												One of the best kart racers around! Don't let my few hours on steam fool you! I had this orginally for xbox360! This game was awesome! I love sonic the hedgehog! This review is biased as hell! ♥♥♥♥ mario! You heard me! Nah just kidding! I like mario kart too but,this sonic game is actually pretty great and I would highly recommed giving it a shot! Words cannot truly express how much fun this racing game is! If you're a sonic fan or like mario kart well you're already sold on it my friend trust me! If you're not a sonic fan then I would probably watch some gameplay and if it doesn't exactly interest you...well better off not getting it. Really it's up to you. I think it's a fun game to just relax and chill with your favorite characters while racing across memorable tracks with some of the best music from the series! I rate it 9.5/10! Absolutely stunning!			"

												The game is great fun the Textures, Sounds, Shaders, FX and the motible advant chouse and moltiplayer finaly now you can race your friends and thay still add the split screen that a big score but there's a few downers about this one compered to the original game 1. The turnting system when you don't have a item you can turnt players by doing a funny pose2. The stunt system er the stunts are fine in this game but in the orignal version your play will jump on the hood of your car or do a hand stand or a pose ect.3. i fell that there less playerble charicters and its sopose to be sega all stars yer there go some poeple for the last game but i miss mobo bomo the robber brothers and the two kirate guys that drive the super car and the strange mouse and the big cat it just seems there there less classic charicters and i would love it if thay add the players for the last game into this one (with out having to pay for them as a DLC)4. i don't know i some people will agree but i would like to have a custom stage system were you can chouse if you what the trace to be Land, Sea or Air yer i like the car transforming but i would like to have a race on trace were it's like all car or all sea or all airso i'm not saying the all bad like a said the graphics is great comperd to the original game i'm just say i would love this game more if thay did some of thows 4 thingmy overall score 8.5/10			"

												This is Sega at their best. I was already a fan of the first one (played on the Xbox 360) and they made great additions in this ""Transformed"" version. I totally imagine this game being launched at the Dreamcast era.This is as good as any kart game can get: good old arcade gameplay with weapons and over the top races, local multiplayer to up 4 players and colorful graphics. If you're playing alone, you can try to unlock tracks and racers to your next game party. The Death Egg + Metal Sonic DLC moved to this sequel and the package is solid: various racers, a lot of tracks and all the traditional modes. I got goosebumps with the After Burner and Golden Axe tracks. The good part of all this is the PC requirements: my laptop with the GTX 740m 2GB runs the game at 60fps (and the loads are minimal in my desktop).Why there is no sequel to this is beyond me. I loved Sega at the 1980's and 1990's and there are still plenty of franchises to cover, like Altered Beast, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Vectorman, Comix Zone and even OutRun. And they could ask to include characters from other franchises that made success at the Genesis era. Could you imagine Toejam & Earl as playable racers? You could take my money already, Sega.Edit 11th July 2016: there is actually an OutRun Bay stage and Space Harrier is present in the Race of AGES stage in form of music and hologram reference. So, there you have it, a complete package for Sega fans.			"

Product received for free
												Hello, everyone. Welcome to my review for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. Here, I will be reviewing each seperate part. Lets start with the World Tour mode.The World Tour mode is essentially a line of 10 (except for Sunshine Coast) races, with two characters (again, except for Sunshine Coast). You earn stars based on what mode you do and if you complete the challenge, and to unlock every character, you have to earn these stars. Doing it on Easy gives you one star, doing it on Medium gives you two, doing it on Hard gives you three, and doing it on Expert gives you four. This is how you unlock most of the characters, except for one... Lets talk about that.The Grand Prix mode is 5 cups, containing the game's 20 (21 if you buy Metal Sonic & Outrun Bay) races. The cups are in this order: Dragon Cup, Rogue Cup, Emerald Cup, Arcade Cup, and Classic Cup. But wait, theres more.  If you finish each cup, you can unlock the mirrored versions of each cup. Finishing these unlocks you Dr. Eggman. So, lets talk about the cast.You have Sonic & his friends, AiAi and MeeMee, Beat, and plenty more. Want to be a part of the past? Choose AGES. Want a unique car? Wreck-It Ralph has you covered. Do you even want to play unarguably the most annoying character?! That would be the Yogscast! (even if I don't find him annoying, just good stats and annoy others that find him annoying even though you can play NiGHTS with the EXACT SAME STATS BUT BEARABLE TO LISTEN TO! Gee, its almost as if they dont WANT you to spend extra money on their game... oh wait, Metal Sonic and Ryo.)Now, we should talk about multiplayer.Multiplayer is really good, actually. You can play with any character you have, even if you cant get back in first if you get hit by... anything, really. Its fun.Overall, I give S&ASRT a 'Yogscast has been eliminated!'/ten.			"

												I have to say i was a bit skeptical about this game before purchasing it, but to be honest its just as good as mario kart...and changing the type of vehicle your in during gameplay is something ive never seen before and it really is the bread and butter of this game.  Aside of the super fun transforming it has multiplayer /2-4 player split screen capabilities which as a pc gamer i like as my bf and i can play split screen together instead of taking turns as with most pc games and even most console games now a days. 10/10 a must buy for kart racing fans			"

												This is one of most fun arcade racing I ever played in years!!! Nice improvement from the original game.Breath-taking visuals, nice soundtrack, great characters to choose and unique race course.  Even includes some free DLC characters exclusive to Steam. Switching your vehicle mode from road track to water track then air track all on the same race track is pretty dam cool!Who needs Need for Speed games. Play this instead. Dont judge by its cover just because of Sonic.Well done Sega and Sumo Digital! "

We may never get the answer to why sonic needs a race car, it's obvious why he needs a boat and a jet.  Buckle up and put the pedal to the medal in this high speed kart racer that hits the seas and takes to the sky.At the core it's the same formula of 'Mario Kart' dressed up with sega (and friends) characters and tracks.  Turns out the formula still works and creates a great looking racer that also plays well.			"

												YOU CAN PLAY AS TEAM FORTRESS!10/10!In all seriousness though, this game is really a lot of fun, a lot of different fun characters and powerup rcing around on excellently designed maps with 3 different types of vehicles on each character. For the people with a sociallife i'd reccomend getting the Console version instead , seeing as to how you cna play split screen with friends on that.Boat controls are a little weird and the maps aren't really desingned to let you do enough stunts. Other than that the other minor issues i have with the game are entirely subjective, such as ""Football Manager"" being a character, just seems weird.on PC 8/10on Console 9/10 because of local multiplayer			"

												I'm not sure why sonic feels the need to own a car but It's a pretty fun racer just the same.It even has tips on which buttons on your xbox controller to press during the loading screen.edit:That was harsh, It's a very pretty game with a great sound track.It's very sonic in that it has lots of loops in the road and I like the customising of lvled up characters.

												It's like Mario kart, but more or less everything is done really well... which is exactly unlike Mario Kart. There's no idiotic bias for weapons based on your position, and it is a largely skill based ordeal.The AI can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥on harder difficulties, so if you get upset easily, but want to be a completionist (or at least unlock everything)  you might want to be wary. For 20€ it's more or less a steal, and anything below that it's a no brainer, which is something i don't say lightly. It also isn't just simply racing. There's some twists thrown in at times in the fashion of challenge maps of drifting, flying and time attack (solo) variety.The only gripe i have with the game is mild randomness in jumping physics in certain maps, especially in boats. If you just get bad waves off something, you can't consistently do flips/drifting to keep up your speed, which probably lost me a couple of races, but it's a small thing to moan about.Average playtime along everyone on friendslist: 22.5 hours.Average playtime along everyone on friendslist with the highest and the lowest removed: 21.1 hours.

												The first Sonic & All-Stars Racing was... meh at best.  This is a HUGE improvement.  It stays fresh no matter what map or level you race on due to the vehicle changing multiple times per race from car to plane to boat, all which control differently.  Add to that 10+ unlockable characters and 5 stat mods to unlock per character and there's a lot of diversity here.  The maps are re-envisionings of classic games in a 3D track form and are extremely well done, featuring remastered and often completely redone BGM rom their respective game sources.  Lots of personality here and you can tell some serious thought was put into this.  Very well balanced and the multiplayer is never laggy.  Well worth a sale price.			"

												So, Kart Racers huh? Yeah. In case you've somehow managed to never touch one before, I shall explain to you very briefly what makes them good: varied and fun racers, varied, dynamic and gorgeous levels, a means of progression (unlocking new levels, racers or upgrades), cool pick-ups and sweet gameplay mechanics. This game has it all.One of the first things I noticed with this game is that the items are fair. Unlike the screwball items in Mario Kart, these items often give you a way to escape the imminent doom, and when it doesn't it makes sure that the user of the item had to carefully aim his weapon. There are no blue or red shells in this game, those suck. The catch-up item in this game is not an impossible-to-dodge blue shell, but is in stead a swarm of totally dodgeable obstacles on the road ahead, that can even help a leading racer to get a bigger advantage, should the driver dodge every obstacle. Other items include a homing cart with dynamite attached to it, which you can dodge by doing a well-timed stunt or jump, or some snowballs that require careful aiming to get right. You are never completely screwed in this game.Then another fact caught my eye: 'these levels are dynamic!', I exclaimed. Yes, the levels are already quite varied, fun and pretty, but they also actually change form. Some levels suddenly blow up, forcing you to morph into a plane (yes, you can do that too) and fly over the now destroyed road, giving you a completely different experience for the final lap. It's quite fun. And that brings me to another point, planes boats and cars. You have all in this game. The way they handle is pretty fun to play with, you have your standard car which handles like it should, then you have your boat which handles, well, like a boat. It's a lot more slippery in bends and it jumps up over waves, and now that I think of it, they are done pretty damn well. Very boat-esque. 10/10 would boat again. Yeah. Oh yes, planes. Planes are like restricted planes. You don't really dive up or down like you would in a normal planing game, it feels like the game sort of prohibits you from flying all over the place, for your own safety. It isn't like you can't turn around, not at all (if anything this game is too loose with your actions, nothing gets punished, which I love), but it just feels like it doesn't want you to turn around. It's done very subly and nicely, really.And then we have all the racers! There are like a thousand of them! You have Sonic and Knucles and Tails and Shadow and Eggman and Beat and, who could forget the most iconic SEGA character, Danica Patrik! Yes, everyone is here. And they have their own carts, too! The stats are done neatly as well, every character has wildly different stats, yet they also have their own mods, which shift over some stats from one category to another, fine-tuning your car for maximum comfort. Personally, I cannot play with anything but Shadow and his balanced mod anymore, I have grown familiar with his stats to a point where even a character with purely better stats would do worse in my hands. I just know exactly how fast he turns around bends and precisely what speeds he can reach, or how much faster boosts make him. Other people have this with other characters, but Shadow+balanced mod is my kind of jam. On one hand it's a shame that I have grown so familiar with him that I cannot play anything else anymore, on the other it's kinda really cool that I got my personal favorite. In any case, these characters work really well.All things combined, this is one of the best kart racers I have ever played and you should experience it too. It is pure joy. This game is absolutely an all-star in my book!			"

												A configuration UI that feels like it's held together with duct tape and some slight graphical effect bugs are the only bad points, because when you are flying through the air with a slow techno remix of the After Burner theme playing in your ear as your 7-year-old cousin whizzes past you, you'll know you made the right purchase.Oh, and no blue shell... shell, anywhere, for miles.

												I was actually surprised at how good this game is!  The air/land/water vehicle transformation gimmick works out nicely, as your vehicle controls rather differently in each form, and the game includes kart-racer staples such as boosts for extended drifting or doing flips and rolls off of ramps (or barrel-rolling out of the way of obstacles when in plane mode)There are no lightning bolts or blue shells to result in cheap losses in this racer, and most attack items work almost instantly; your demise is entirely determined by how well the other guy aims regardless of any amount of defensive driving. On one hand, most attacks won't slow you down all THAT much, but on the other hand, regaining lost position is not as easy as most racers. If you fall to last place, count yourself lucky if you can get back up to fourth or third.Apart from the standard GP and single races, the game also features a robust ""world tour"" mode filled with challenges ranging from drift challenges, traffic dodging, time trials, battle races, and even boss battles against a tank.I'd definitely call this game worth trying, even if you aren't the biggest fan of Sonic and friends.

												This is by far the best kart racer I've ever played, and blows away any version of Mario Kart. The game balance is fine-tuned: There is no best character or best car, and if you don't like the way a particular character handles at first, you can unlock alterations. There are no spoiler weapons like blue shells. The races are skill-based, there aren't any ways to skip over massive sections of track a la Mario Kart.The design is incredible, several of the levels blew me away in terms of visuals.The game scales down well if you are running an older system (playing this on a laptop I bought in 2009).The AI is challenging. On the hardest difficulty, you will only beat them on the hardest difficulty by mastering the gameplay and then mastering the track in turn.Extremely worthwhile purchase if you have any interest in kart racers.

												I loved this game on the 3DS, and I love how you added characters from different games (TF2 being my favorite).  But, there is a major issue I can't seem to fix: drifting. I've looked at discussions, but doing Accelerate, Turn, and Drift/Brake only turns on my brakes. I've been playing on my Steam Controller, and this is REALLY annoying, not being able to drift. Your separate Configure application is difficult to work with, also, with my Steam Controller. I find it better to do mappings in-game.So, if someone could help me with this, that would be nice. If you could change Brake and Drifting to be separate controls, that'd be even more nice.A tutorial track should also be made.			"

												An exellent kart racing game.   Simple but beautiful visuals accompany some very awesome race tracks as you transform from plane to car to boat trying to beat your opponents.   There are a variety of characters to choose from each with their own transforming vehicle.   The pickups are pretty good but nothing too special.   This game can become very fun online or when playing with friends.  Split-screen can be played online which is a plus.   Controls are smooth.   One of the best, if not the best Kart racers to come along in along time.+Controls great with X360 Gamepad+Graphics are pleasing and not too demanding+Variety of characters from the SEGA to choose+Split-Screen racing for friends.-Only 1 extra track has been released.  Needs a few more.-Touching other players in online races can have odd physics related issued.-			"
