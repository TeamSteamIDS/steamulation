												I imidiatly thought : Pirate Vr game? Here we go !. Sadly this is barely a mini-game and maybe would be worth 1-2 bucks but surely no 12.....There are a million times better VR games out there. Don't buy this one			"

												Ship combat is fun and something I haven't seen other VR games do. Some of the voice actors are great, short game but worth giving it a go.			"

												Controls get wonky at times and should be tweaked to make the sailing and sea battles more enjoyable. The game is way too short. The above said. I had a blast playing it and look forward to more VR games like this.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. Visually, I love it. However, there is no justification for charging $12 for a game that took barely an hour to complete and which has absolutely no replay value. The gameplay was incredibly simple and just not that much fun. I heard that this game was originally for mobile VR, so maybe it's better on those setups, but on the vive it's just not worth it. Stay clear unless you don't mind an incredibly short experience that isn't that much fun.			"

												Original gear VR game.  Graphics are good, not great.  THis game is like an RPG and very simple.  So far, I like it.  I managed to learn how to sail the seas, take over a ship, kill some pirates.  I noticed you can upgrade your ship!  That's a good thing.  Sound is excellent, voice acting ranges from great to okay!Controls are vive controllers.  They managed to get them to work like expected.  This is a very good sign.			"

												pros:- First Pirate Game on Vive- Ship Battles are awesome, and immersive- SOme cool features like sea monsters etccons:- linear story line and very short- Graphics very bad, like nintendo 64i had a great time in this game because i love piracy and because the vive needs more games, so i liked this one, of course you play it only for the vr, but its awesome, i hope the devs improve the game			"

I also review other VR games on my channel: {LINK REMOVED}https://goo.gl/ijNuDJCAST OFF FOR A FUN VR PIRATE ADVENTURE!!I'm loving this game so far I'm an hour in and i'm having a blast! The gameplay is extremely fun and cartoony-ish. Sailing a pirate ship in VR is fun and fancy entertainment! The difficulty of boarding ships has something to be said though.... it was super easy but I've only done one. Hopefully there are more to be seen!! YAHR!!!			"

												with some problems, it's an intersting VR try. Vive control is fun. The first pirate and sailling game on VR for now.+ fun naval battle + fun Vive control ( the rudder control is dream fullfilling )+ good VR experience+ some stunning scens like huge whale - graphics is mobile class (i foud it's an original mobile game explans the graphics thing).- need multiplayer !!!Considering to other so call VR games( turned out to be demos ), this is nearly a complete game. Have problems and obvious shortcomings but worth the money.If you have HTC, Should have one.			"

												Wow, this looks really good! Simple and effective cartoonish graphic, works great on 1.8 Super Sample on G1 1080 and we all know that definition is more important than detail in VR. Feels like being in Monkey Island, and gameplay seems to be quite good as well. So far i really reccomend it.			"

												It's a super fun game. I would say it's a very cool and well designed story, with VR i can totally feel i am the pirate doing all the shooting and other activities in the game! I can also choose to upgrade my ship and use different weapons, the contents are rich, so i can take my time to try out different things. Highly recommended!!!			"

												Just spent some quality time with this game. Love:- Control is smooth- Especially love the combat in the open ocean, fun yet challenging with the VR- Pirate element (voice, graphics, story)  is authentic so for those who love this theme, this is a must-tryRoom to improve:- Wish the story is a bit longer so I can have some more fun? Or hope there's a Part II*Overall strongly recommanded.			"

												This game surprised me. There aren't a huge amount of longer story-based games out there on the Vive. I like the cartoony graphics and the ship battles are pretty fun. The game isn't perfect, but it's a good time killer.

			Had to do another round of Heroes of the Seven Seas. It's story driven and a refreshing change from the many wave shooters out there on the Vive. I ran into a stiff foe towards the end though!

The potential for this game is insane. Seriously. The ship aspect of it is extremely fun. Building your ship, going on missions... omg. When I was in harbor and walking around, talking to the NPCs reminded me of games like FF7 where it was actually fun to see what the natives had to say about certain things. Being able to explore big towns while in port would be amazing. The 1st person fights are pretty cool too. I would love the addition of a sword so you can pick between shooting people or melee fighting. If you make this a 20 hour or so game that is sand boxy but also has a ton of side quests and content, this could easily be one of the best VR games. I want more ships in my pirate armada that I can collect. I'd like a crew I can customize and gear up.   I would also like to be able to gear myself up, like in most RPGs. I would LOVE IT if you added voice command so you can just YELL at your crew to move the ship... like a real pirate captain would do. Either that or add a head movement, so if you tilt your head left, the ship goes left. Tilt it right and the ship goes right. Other VR games have done this with great success. The weapon targetting felt good. It got a little crazy when I was also trying to steer the ship, hense the suggestions on alternate ways to move the ship. The teleport options feels OK. I would like a simple push a button and move forward option. I know this option gives a ton of people motion sickness, but there are also a ton of people who do not experience motion sickness at all, and simply moving through the world feels better for us. I am very happy with it I just wish it was longer :(Great job!/heavy breathing			"

												Heroes of the Seven Seas is a VR pirate adventure that’s not particularly lengthy but still manages to impress if only by its gameplay. The graphics are not particularly great and resemble an early PS2 era game. The naval combat however, is actually quite fun and the game keeps adding new weapons and objectives to keep things interesting. There’s also a fairly challenging wave shooter sequence at the very end of the game. This is a title worth trying but you shouldn’t go into it expecting a whole lot, nor to spend more than an hour (par for the course for most VR experiences).			"
