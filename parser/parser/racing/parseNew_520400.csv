								Great game, using boost to make perfect drifts is like a dream that becomes true! I really love all the graphics, cars and their parts are very nice looking, and I feel highly involved into the race.I see a lot of potential here and I can't wait to start my career. Shut up and take my money! :D			"

								This game is awsome !!! Much better than other racing Games !!! But for the future i would like to see:-Parts being unlocked when winning a Race (example: Hyber Speedway with 3 laps and Manual Transmission to win the new bumper)-more Tracks-better Performance-better Handling-more Parts in totalBut exept that its the best Game i ever played since i bought Minecraft and Scrap Mechanic :) "

								So firs off I'd like to say im so glad this game is finally out, ive been following development for a while, saying as this is early access I have noticed some things that need some work, but overall the game has a lot of potential! The visuals are stunning and the art style is really cool. as I mentioned in my email this morning, the controls do need a touch of work, (coming from someone playing on a keyboard). I really do love the game and I cant wait to see where it goes!			"

								Great game! Very pretty considering it's early access state, and they're going to allow you to 3D print your cars which is super neat and a pretty new concept in gaming. Has a lot of promise and i'm excited to see what else they have in store to come. Not super realistic controls but like I said, early access, and i'm sure it'll improve as they develope. Here's a look at it so far

								Ignore the thumbs down and read what I'm thinking 'cause even if I have to give it a thumbs down it's not what I want to do...The thing is that I love racing games, have played all the NFS's up 'til Shift (and some after, hate the newest BTW...) I've played all the Forza's apart from 6 (felt weird and too gimmicky) and so on and this game's not for me or you if you're like me.This game I feel is for the Trackmania crowd/type of gamers, it lacks in proper responce as far as the thumbstick goes and you can't (not without changing some settings at least) use the D-pad instead so I do think that the KBD is the best way to play and that you need to know how to use it properly to enjoy it.So that's why I give it a thumbs down, not due to it being a bad game but due to being a game I didn't expect it to be and made for people who aren't like me so I do wish Steam had up/down/Not my kind of game...Yeah, come to think of it, let's end on a positive note, it did run very well on my Phenom II 955/8 GB RAM/R9 285 box @ 1080p, I did put the graphics to the highest setting. (I didn't bother with AA and such though)			"
