								A nice funny game with a lot of potential... I realy enjoyed Draw Rider 1. What this game needs is: Character customisation ; A Steam Workshop for community content (for example selfmade characters and Levels to keep things fresh) ; maybe Checkpoints in some levels that are hard to master ; AND whats realy importent: LEVELS to keep people interested, maybe you can add a litle more with every update.  Pumped to see whats coming out in the future <3			"

								there are a lot of platformer games around - but this one is the first where you are not running and jumping through different obstacles but riding on a bike! Game has an interesting physics, that is not that straightforward like in most platformer games, where character is just moving with constant same acceleration, here you have faster speeds when going downwards, and you need to accelerate to move upwards - in addition to the physics you have lots of violence, where you biker is destroyed in any possible way, so that it would be good idea to add checkpoints to save not to start a level from the very beginning.game's still in early access, but takingn into consideration its a sequel for draw rider 1 i am sure that everything will be ok with lots of levels. its not expencive, so you can buy it.
