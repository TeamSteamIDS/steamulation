IntroductionSometimes you’re not looking for something deep or meaningful. Sometimes you just want to casually play a game, without thinking too much and without having to worry about things like complex control schemes. If you’re in the mood for such a game right now then My Paper Boat might just be the thing. Read on and let’s find out together.GameplayThe fact that the game is called My Paper Boat lets you know what kind of game you should expect here. As I mentioned it’s nothing deep or complex, but if you’re looking for a relaxing, fairly mindless, game then My Paper Boat is ideal, but in my opinion, only in small sessions.The game has 3 modes that can be played right from the start. You have: Aim, where you try to hit targets with your cannon, Rally, where you go through the rings/checkpoints (which add a few seconds to your timer) and Collect, where you try to collect all of the 50 coins that are scattered throughout the level.Unfortunately, the levels are rather linear. Ocassionally you’ll be able to go one way or another but in the end you’ll always end up in the same place and it’s usually just for a few metres.Each level lasts about 10 minutes, give or take, and there are 5 different locations. There is Garden, Desert, Cave, Canyon and Forest. The later levels have to be unlocked with your earned stars, but fortunately these levels can practically be unlocked after one try, maybe two at the most. In each of the levels you’ll find obstacles that have to be avoided. In the garden there are rocks and waterlilies, which can be easily avoided, but later levels might give you a little more trouble; the desert level has whirlwinds that will toss you away and the caves for example have swinging shackles/hooks. None of the levels are particularly interesting, but I do have to admit the Canyon level was kind of fun, because here the boat will go downstream and you’ll have to avoid rocks while going at a faster pace than normal.

In the levels you will also find a powerup in the form of a lightning bolt that, when pressed, will give you extra speed for a few seconds (or get you off land whenever you’re stuck)), and a health pickup that slightly restores your boat when it’s become damaged. That’s right, even though it’s a fairly casual affair your boat will still take damage when it drops from a high distance or if you hit a rock or other object with more speed than normal (or just hit it the wrong way). A nice feature is that your boat will start to crumple whenever it takes damage, like real life paper.Sometimes you’ll go to fast or get tossed around and you end up on the land. Whenever that happens you have 10 seconds to try to return to the water or else you’ll have to restart from the checkpoint. Each level usually has 2 or 3 checkpoint so it’s not a big deal normally speaking, but there were a few times were I had to do a section a couple of times because I kept getting thrown on the land. During my first playthrough I also encountered a bug that got me stuck in the environment. With no option to reset your boat you then have to either start from a checkpoint or from the beginning, depending on how far you had already progressed.If you really can’t get enough of the game then you also have the ability to unlock parts for your boat. These are purely cosmetic and won’t give you any extra abilities or anything, but it’s a nice touch, especially if you really enjoy(ed) the game. You will have to unlock them with stars, though, so not everything is available the first time, but that’s the reason why they’re called unlockables, of course.A few examples of what you can customize and unlock: flags, anchors, spyglasses and patterns for your boat (regular, white, paper or newspaper, et cetera). Fun stuff and a good reason to try and unlock all of the stars.

Audio & VisualsI can be very short about the musical aspect of this game; except for the main menu there doesn’t seem to be any music. I personally enjoyed that, because the goal seems to be to provide the player a relaxing experience. It manages to do this perfectly fine this way. Naturally there are sounds effects, like when you pick-up a coin, or shoot your cannon. Nothing extraordinary, though.As for the visuals; it’s a pretty game, but very demanding. I had to turn down the ‘resolution scale’ to get a good performance. Unfortunately, though, it also seems to use a lot of filters and other effects and they mess up the clarity and image quality. As you can see from the screenshots a lot of the objects look (and are) blurry. There’s also sun/light reflection but somehow the developer went overboard with this. Once again, this can be seen by taking a look at the screenshot below.If only the image quality would’ve been sharper this game would’ve looked perfect. Right now it’s not what I hoped it would look like in motion. Don’t get me wrong, please, because the game is still very pretty, even if the water sometimes also looks a bit oily.

Length/Replay ValueThe downside to casual games is that they’re usually meant for short sessions. This applies to My Paper Boat as well. It’s fun in small doses, but play it for a few hours and you’ll most likely will have seen everything by the time you’re done. The available modes didn’t invite me to replay any of the levels, since all of them start out the same, and have the exact same routes. I think most people will have finished it (or at least will have seen what it has to offer) in roughly 2-3 hours of playtime.ConclusionI can be short about this: My Paper Boat is a fun experience if you’re looking for a small game to kill your time with, or if you’re not in the mood for something complex. It’s relaxing and fortunately has enough gameplay to keep you occupied for 2-3 hours, but after that you most likely won’t start it again anytime soon. It won’t win any awards, but it’s still a somewhat unique little game. Therefore I recommend to grab it when it's just a little cheaper, or if you have some extra money to spend and desperately want to add a +1 to your game collection.Too long, didn’t readPros:+ Graphics+ Relaxing atmosphere+ Funny unlockablesMixed:+/- Levels are too linearCons:- Too many filters and effects used for the graphics- Little replay value  Please note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.

TL:DR: This is a fun game, but I think it might be a bit expensive for the content given, if you can get it for $5 definitely pick it up, though! 6.5/10 Review My Paper Boat is a cute little game in which you play as a paper boat sailing around different landscapes, environmentally it is incredibly beautiful and the controls are on point for what a paper boat would be. Gameplay wise, there are 3 different game modes, two of which feel very similar, the third, aim mode, is quite unique and really fun. To me, this game is definitely more of a relaxation activity than a full on game. Pros   Beautifully crafted environments that feel very real.  Controls are spot on.  Music is great, ambient sounds are very calming in game.  Levels are very long.  Boat Customization is neat, lots of different options for flags, etc. Cons   Only 3 game modes with 5 maps, can get boring quick.  No sound options in the menu, the sound blasted out my ears when I opened the game.  Coin Collection feels very similar to Rally. Conclusion This game is clearly beautifully crafted with a lot of love, the music and graphics are stunning, the ambient sounds are accurate for the areas, the controls are spot on for how a paper boat would control. Sadly with only 3 game modes, two of which feel very similar and 5 maps, although each map is quite long, the game got boring rather quickly and left me feeling wanting for more to do. I'd love to see a racing mode against AI or even multiplayer? to give far more replayability of an otherwise great game.6.5/10			"

												While I can appreciate the concept of ""My Paper Boat"". I think it fails to hit it's mark. Here's where I think the majority of the mistakes are made:1) While on the casual side of things, this idea seems brilliant. You have a nice relaxing setting & a very innocent somewhat nostalgic pass time. The beautiful settings turn out to be very aesthetically noisy & a bit gaudy. It's hard to just play & relax. I find myself squinting just to focus. This problem is just compounded by the the water effects, mainly waterfalls. When you get water on the camera you get the expected result of image distortion. The problem is that when the setting is already irritating, the added distortion is not welcome.2) The controls need a bit of tweeking. While using KB&M some of the controls function like you'd expect in some areas, but not others. For instance if you highlight ""Game Modes"" from the main menu & press ""Enter"", highlight 1 of 3 modes & press ""Enter"", now highlight a map & press ""Enter"". The ""Enter"" button will work the 1st 2 times. The map selection forces you to click on the map with your mouse. Why do the rules on a button change? Now try to use that steaming heap of crap called a Steam Controller & you add an entire layer of tweeking, because nobody could be bothered to deal with it beforehand. These are just 2 problems I found in 30 minutes of play in ""Regular"" mode. I haven't even tried the other 2 modes, but I doubt these issues are not intrusive there as well.			"

My Paper Boat is a quaint little physics-based simulation of controlling a paper boat around various levels. With the games beautiful water and incredibly chill sound track, it inspires the similar relaxing feel as similar games like Euro Truck Sim. For €9.99, it is worth picking up as a stress reliever alone using the coin challenge while ignoring the actual goal of that mode.Perfect little game to come out of nowhere.			"

												This thing should've been named ""The Art of the CTD"", because it does that quite well. You can almost bet on the game dying, usually with an error message but sometimes not, at every race checkpoint, sometimes when loading races, and at race ends regardless of which of the three menu options are chosen.As a game it's...not all that interesting. It might be zen-like as others term it, but only on the lowest settings if you're not into a jet engine video card. Kinda kills the calming atmosphere when the buddha statues get blown out the window, ya know? Were it not for the UE4 logo at game start I'd have assumed this was another poorly optimized Unity title.For $3 it'd be alright sans crashes, but with them it really is not. Also, hilarious overuse of bloom on the highest settings requires sunglasses. Still doesn't hide the horrific environment textures, guys...			"

												A hidden game gem; thats all one can really say about this relaxing and sometimes annoying (in a good puzzely way).There is alot of hidden areas to explore and there is always an achivement to strife for (example; collect all coins in a level).Gameplay wise this is a really good hidden gem.Id even say it is worth the full price of 5 Euros. (not something I most often feel is the case with  other games)			"

												Its casual so slow paced gameplay is expected but wow, that is almost something I would play to go to sleep, I like the consept but maybe add a game mode to spice things up, multiplayer racing maybe, or cannons + boats + multiplayer = online paper boat massacur xD I would play a game where I can play a paper boat version of a first person shooter xD or third person in this case.I would suggest this game if you like casual games.If you don't like slow-paced games, this isn't for you			"

												Sometimes you're in the mood to play some video games, but you don't really want to deal with angry teammates and opponents telling you you're the scum of the earth and that you should garrotte yourself with a rusty paperclip. My Paper Boat does well in that situation.There are three different gamemodes across 5 different maps ... mild replayability if you want to get full 3-star status for achievements. Was able to 3-star most of the maps on my first try ... there are two levels I still have been unable to do so with, to the point where I'm wondering if there isn't some glitch and it's even possible.The graphics are actually pretty good considering what this title is; the environments and sound are what pull this title together in my opinion.Some thoughts/concerns:- No music to speak of, though I'm not holding that against this particular game. Just listening to the flow of the river or whatnot is quite soothing and fits the game.- ♥♥♥♥ those mini-tornadoes on environment 2. Those do not help me relax at all.- ♥♥♥♥ that ultra-bright glare from the gold on environment 3. That hurts my eyes and doesn't help me relax at all.- I'm convinced that getting 3-star on two of the modes for environment 3 is actually impossible. Like, there aren't as many collectibles on the map to actually achieve the objective. I achieved 3-star on every other environment (even the later, more difficult ones) after 1-3 tries. I've tried these maybe dozens of times with the same results each time.			"
