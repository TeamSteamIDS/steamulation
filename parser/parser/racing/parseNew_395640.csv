												I liked how the track can be custom made by flying a spaceship, but as far as I can tell, Multiplayer is dead, and Single Player is a joke.  I'd like a refund.			"

												Could not find any sort of singleplayer mode.  Could only find multiplayer and split-screen. Requested a refund.			"

												I do recommend this game, not just to racing fans but to players that aren't racing fans aswell. The reason for that is the fact that this game is very easy to pick up and play. Anyone can play it, you don't need boring tutorial levels and you don't need 2 frustrating hours just to learn how to play. Just pick up your controller or use your keyboard and you are ready to play. Another reason is the absence of tracks and track memorisation, you don't get irritated on that guy or girl that knows all the tracks and shortcuts. Because there isn't any of that in this game. Your skill as a racer or the paver is going to determine if your'e gonna win or lose. I've had a tonne of fun along with my friends and this game the last couple of days since it was released (""Just one more race"") :)			"

												A fun game that is easy to learn. Velocity stream has a unique track creation system where one of the players create the track while the others race.			"

												Had a realy nice couple off evenings with my friends and this game. Its really fun when you get the hang of it. Playing the diffrent racers is the most fun and when you get the feel for taking the curves right!			"

												This is a great game, the mechanics are awesome with the paver and it really comes to its best the you are playing as a racer and lying right behind it, you never know whats the next move. Very good feeling in the different racers and after some time you learn how to read the road in front of you and how to handle the different ""moves"" the Paver throws at you. Awesome graphics with a feeling like Tron and very mood full music. Thumbs up.			"
