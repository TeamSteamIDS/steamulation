								At this stage, no. I don't recommend. You drive straight, and in circles, and after 15 minutes can sort out a ""decent"" strategy to drive until the game screws you over. It provides laughs, but you can do the same stuff in Blockland for free. Wait until this game has completed content before purchasing. It has potential. But is empty for now.			"

								You have a friendship that needs to put on a test?This is your tool, and you'll even end up having a ton of fun!""Can't Drive This"" is a party-game to give you and your friends a lot of reasons to yell at each other and a reason for that making-it-all-up-again-cold-beverage afterwards.The objective is simple: One builds a neat driving track, while the other has to drive it (yes, WHILE it is being built) and the driver must (in all Speed-ish style) not drop below a certain speed.But that'd be way too simple, there is un-simplifying obstacles like windmills you can crash into, trapdoors you can fall down in, pinball bumpers that almost literally bump'n'kick you out of the screen, and many, many more the driver will hate the builder for placing right in front of them.So, yeah, lots of chaos, lots of fun, lots of yelling :-DQuick rundown of the most important features:- LOCAL PLAY! While you CAN play online, this features local play, both players on one computer, a.k.a. ""Couch CoOp""- Multiple gamemodes (as of writing this some are still in development)- Multiple vehicles to chosse from (that also differ in driving behaviour!)- Customizable track visuals....and more being constantly added (the game is in Early Access and being updated often at the time of this review).So, if you need another hit for your next party, try this :-)			"

+ So much fun when playing with friends! It may not look like much, but the gameplay is an absolute joy. One person drives the truck, while the other person lays down the track from a top-down perspective. You really have to communicate and work together to try to make it as far as you can.+ The game reminds me a bit of Wipeout. Some of the track pieces placed down have various obstacles that make it difficult for the driver to get through. Boost pads, ramps, a bell that pushes you off, water traps, turntables, windmills, etc.+ Visually the game looks nice with some great looking water+ Obviously this review is a bit early, but it looks like more game modes / features will be added throughout Early Access including a sandbox mode which sounds like a lot of fun.+ Good background musicThis game is in Early Access so these are subject to change- I felt like the fail timer is a bit too harsh. Basically if you don't go a certain speed you lose so if you hit a wall or an object chances are you will fail about 1-2 seconds later as it's difficult to get your speed back. - There are various walled off tiles that are already placed our in the water that the track editor needs to work around. These can be hard to anticipate. I'd suggest they be replaced with difficult obstacles that are hard for the driver to get through but still possible.			"

								They've taken the pressure mechanic of ""pipe dream"" and added a manic driving component. It's a wonderfully chaotic blend of styles that I've never played before.

								The concept seems fun, lots of potential for chaos but the car exploding if you drive anything less than perfect is a real buzz-kill. It doesn't offer any breathing room to get to know the game or build any thought-out routes. An option to increase the amount of time before exploding or an option to disable it would be great, for those who are still figuring things out. Otherwise I'll keep an eye on this game for a while			"

								This game is hilarious but should only be played with friends, it needs that connection and voice chat element to truly be worth your time. That said, if you have someone to play with, you will be hard pressed to find a more entertaining time for the money. It does still have a fair few bugs, these will hopefully be ironed out in time but for now they do add a rather interesting twist to the gameplay. Like when you can't place a bit of road and you comically panic whilst watching your friend tumble into the water. Or when you get stuck in a peice of the scenery after a big jump. It's all good fun though because the game is so light hearted. Check out my video below and you'll see why these things can be so easily forgiven:

								Let's be honest, you look at this game and what do you think?  Probably something like: hey, that looks cute, probably fun for a couple of hours but not really something I'd buy.This game is by no means perfect, but it is AWESOME.  When I think of things to compare it to, I think games like Super Smash Bros. or the classic Pole Position.  It's just the most hype inducing, focus requiring, shout inspiring, frustrating game ever.  It looks easy enough, ""oh, I'll just drive slow.""  Nope.  ""I'll just go straight.""  You're funny.  ""How bout I just throw away this piece."" Good luck with that.While there are legit strategies, there is no way around it.  This game is all about quick thinking, reflexes, and communication.  It's the kind of game that has you shouting and getting super frustrated but also super happy when you beat a personal record.The gameplay is amazing.  I spent most of my time so far playing with a friend online, but I did play a few public matches as well.  It is the kind of game that is way more fun with a friend.  However, since it is setup with local split screen you have the setup for a hillarious living room game session with friends.  And you may think, ""ew split screen.""  But the game is split screen no matter what (even nonlocal), because you need to see what your partner is doing.So while this games does a lot right, it does a lot of others not so great.  This game's central focus relies on connectivity being on point so if there are any problems you're screwed.  Any latency, toast.  I'm not sure what can really be done about it, but we had several games end because of lag and a few matches where we just completely disconnected.  It sucks that the core element of this game means any connection issue is your ruin.Also, the music is ok... like what is there sounds good, but there's like 2 songs.  It is very repetitive.  More tracks are needed ASAP.Gameplay/mechanics wise the only bad thing is it is almost impossible to recover from a trap.  Like if you hit a bell, it is impossible to straighten your car out mid air.  Also I kind of wish the different car models had sort of different specs to them for another layer of strategy.Overall it is a fun game.  It has the potential for hours of hillarious, intense, dramatic fun.  Just turn off the music and play local if you can.  I give it an 8/10.Pros:- Awesome gameplay- Local multiplayer, public and private online as well- Customizable tracks and car- Controller support- Leader boardsCons:- Reptetive music- Connection issues- Hard to control vehicle in the airFeatures I'd like to see added:- Unique stats to certain cars- More music- A 2v2 mode - so basically like the regular except two teams face off with the same tracks, same start time, etc.  Then it's just a race to see who gets further. Or it could be a, who gets to a certain point first.- An option to utilize a dual monitor setup instead of split screen- maybe a way to switch driver and track layer without editting a game.- obviously the more tracks the better "

We both laughed so much, was great.

								Recommended for those who love puzzles and driving, the game combines those two elements together in an extremely fun adventure, that you could either play solo or online, against strangers, or with your steam friends. The game also gives you many ways to customize your own vehicle and other elements, so they go along your own taste, or sometimes help you advance in the game, by picking up a color that would grab your attention and will be enough distinctive from the other colors to smoothen your gameplay. Without tripping there's no result! The game is one of those games where it's impossible not to fail at some point, but that's what makes it even better, because it shows how determined you are to go as far as you can, in the company of your friends! A true team-work game!

								Myself and a friend played for about 40 minutes a couple days before Early access. Given that it has a long way to go, it was still fun and a good start. My biggest complaint even at this point is that the pieces didn't rotate. Also, I'm really not happy with the 20MPH thing when any mistake you makes causes you to lose. The handling characteristics are not really good for this mode. I feel like it needs more of the driving feel of Track Mania. Each vehicle does have its own subtle differences in physics, but not enough to want to pick one over the other. Maybe the default Monster truck since it can go over the barriers much easier, but then the lack of gravity keeps you suspended for far too long to have a chance to get going again.This video of our first playthrough says enough, I think.

								Good idea, but that is all the advantages of this game.With the game on the network, not on the local machine, it does not prevent the separation of the screen into 2 parts.There are a constant ""out of syncs"", not appearing blocks that builds comrade, the car blows up when the danger scale still have some place inside.

								This game takes n-sync brains to get high scores! It is honestly one of the best coop driving indie games out there. With a friend, you must get the furthest distance you can with one person building and one person driving. With so much room for error, it creates an addictive, laughable time that you just can't put down.I played this with my wife and we had a blast. I wish there was a little more in the game right now, but there are many updates to come that will definitely keep bringing me back for more! I did a video review on this if anyone cares to check it out. It is just me and my wife laughing and raging over this awesome game. Thanks Pixel-Maniacs!

								Curator Review: Can't Drive This is insane, chaotic, and exciting in the best way. Silly and cute, it is a hilariously good time.The premise is simple: one person builds the road while another person tries to drive on it. This sounds easy enough. However, the person who is driving has to maintain a constant speed and this eventually leads to hectic road building and chaotic driving. The builder only gets new pieces as the driver covers more distance and going backwards hurts the score. There will be a point in time where you are building pieces right underneath the driver's tires. To make things even crazier, there are trap pieces of road. Dodge wrecking balls, windmills, speed bumps, and more while trying to just stay on course. Luckily, the controls are easy to use and understand, being both responsive and simple.The only thing I didn't like about the game was the limited soundtrack. While the music that is playing is good it can get annoyingly repetitious after a short while. Taking into account this is early access, I would hope there will be more music added to the game later to help make this game a longer lasting playing experience.For the future, I hope for more game modes, more players, and a test track for practicing driving.This game is available as a local co-op, online co-op, or a random matchup with other players online so it is great for every type of set-up. No matter your set-up, the game is spilt screen so you can always see both perspectives. This comes into play on certain trap pieces where it will splash the screen for both players, increasing the difficulty.Can't Drive This takes simple gameplay and turns it into a game that anybody can play and have an absolute blast! In the video below, we had to stop playing at one point because my compatriot was laughing too hard at the sillyness that had befallen us in the game. She doesn't play too many different video games but she thoroughly enjoyed this experience.8/10 Early Access Experience

								Promising project, you get a vertical splitscreen with another player (can be random over internet) and you're either in charge of driving the car or building the track.The goal is to advance as far as you can, however multiple other gamemodes are greyed out and promised in the main menu.As for now building tracks can be fun and challenging, but you'll have to rejoin over and over and over again if you'd want to be the driver, because people seem to flat out spam blocks and ragequit if they're the builder.Going to leave this game sitting in my inventory until an option to change tasks/choose tasks is implemented, keep your eye on this game.

								At the current time I can't recommend this game unless you have already lined up someone to play with. From my limited attempts, there are too few people playing the game online to find someone to play with. I tried 5 different occassions on both maps and was unable to find someone to play with.On the positive side, if you have a controller you can do the ""hot seat"" single player where one person with the keyboard/mouse creates the course as the other person drives.I bought this mainly to support the penguins, it was a good idea from the devs!

								I was one of the lucky people to revieve this game early for free from the developers over at Pixel Maniacs, and I highly recommend it. The game has a very unique concept behind it that is like no other game. It provides a fun game to play with a friend or an insane challenge for those who don't have friends (like me :P)  to play on their own. The artwork is really well done and as far as I've seen there aren't any glitches or bugs. I definitelly think it's at least worth trying out.			"

								At this moment in time I wouldn't recommend this game. It has a lot of bugs at the moments; like when you select rematch sometimes it chooses not to work and you have to exit to the main menu and try again. The timer before your car explodes is too short, you either die immediately or have to go so fast that the other player can't place objects in an effective manner. TLDR;Buggy and just not fun atm.

								Great fun. Latency will mess with you pretty often. I'm playing on 150+ mbps and it's an issue. When it's working it's an absolute joy. Right now it seems about 50/50 if skill or latency will get you. I describe this as an arcade driving roguelike where the generation is played by a frenemy. When you get on a good run it is gaming bliss. Latency will make you salty, the flipping that activates on your car will drive you nuts. This needs a button to activate it (trigger?) so you dont just end up inadventedly front flipping. That or just make accelerate and steering not on the same joystick. It's got it's issues but local or online with friends it's quite rewarding. If you go looking for things to hate you'll find them. Try to find what you enjoy instead, there is a lot of that here. There seems to be one hell of a bug that double places blocks disabling the placement of further blocks. Haven't seen if this is something that occurs on the local as well. Also, the physics calculations can vary wildly from one persons perspective to the other, leading the building player to believe someone is further/shorter/in the air/in the water/alive/dead. Definitely bugs throughout, but the times when it works flawlessly makes me forget about that. Runs take only a short period of time anyway. Again, it's about 50/50 between killed by skill/reaction time and killed by latency or physics calculated differently between users.I'd love to see more tilesets/game modes, as well as more cars. Power-ups would be welcome here. Block varieties with things like banked corners and multi level blocks and crossing trafficked highways etc etc. More zaz basically.It's cheap. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. If I stop playing it tomorrow it'll have been worth my time.Play Everything			"

								Positives- Really Fun- Easy to pick up and play- Hard but fair- High skill/ high reward- Can go backwards for -points- Can play singleplayer/local/online- High amount of customization- Only costs $11 (Canadian)Negatives- Still fairly buggy but isn't even early access yet.- Vehicle controls are a bit slippery- There isn't a car shaped like a banana. (This is my friends suggestion) Please add this he really wants it.If you'd like to watch my endevors (both single and multiplayer)

								This game is amazing, it takes stragey and mergs it with racing and customization stuff, I have a list of stuff I liked and Disliked about this game, this will change throught out updates as it is baised on this one verson of the gameLikes:What i really like about this game is the customization, you can make your car look really cool and jacked up or make it look so weird that people question it, as their are patterns and a whole pile of colors to add to it but not only can you customize the vechiles you can also custom the track and have a track that looks normal or have a track that looks bright orangeI like the gameplay, it is a fun time and most of the time you will be laughing because you either messed up or the other person messed up or something just funny happened, it's very simple to control but the turns are hard to do i found Dislikes:Now their are a few dislikes and they don't really effect that much but still they are thereOne is the customization for the vechile feels a bit dry, like their are a lot of colors and a few patterns and thats all and good but the type of cars and the props are dry, their are about 5 things to put on the front and about 6 on the back (not exact number) it feels their need to be a bit more to make your car feel origanal The game is in early access and that means the game is missing alot of content and the only thing you can play right now is the build and driveThe game needs something to be added to the online play, most of the time your not finding someone and even when you do it doesn't feel the same as when you play with a freind or somethingtheir needs to be an easier way to switch what each person is doing, when you are playing with friends and you want to switch you have to leave the game and then have the person who wants to be the driver invite you to the game and then playand lastly is bug, their are a lot of bugs due to it being a early access game, some of them are funny (once i was changing the color of my vechile and suddenly it started floating away) and some are game breaking like it wouldn't place the blockOVERALL:Overall this game is very fun, but it's only really injoyable if you have a freind with you, and the dislikes is something small and can be changed overtime and i'm not holding it guilty for that, if a few bugs were fixed and some features were added i would give this a 10/10 dead on but until then i'm going to give it a 8.5/10 enjoyable, can be more enjoyable.

								My first review for a game, but I'll say that this game is pretty good. Granted at the time of this comment it was a private access beta and I got 2 Steam codes for free, but nevertheless, It was fun. It had a few a few issues here and there but overall it was good. Depending on the sale price when this goes live I feel like this game could be good for many people. I recorded some gameplay and my friend which got my 2nd code streamed to Twitch.

								**ESPECIALLY FOR MAC USERS**Boyfriend got me this game to play with him but I can't experience the fun. Since the game is available for mac, I thought there wouldn't be a problem but I was wrong. The game doesn't even get passed the loading screen since it never responds and you always have to force quit the application. If you somehow get it to load past the developper's screen and you decide to exit the game, it wont open and load again for who knows how long. One day it works, the other doesn't. It feels like i'm gambling whenever I want to give it another chance. I don't know if there will ever be a bug fix but until then, I certainly do not recommend this game for those who run on a mac.

								Enjoy it, a little hectic.It is a very unique idea, but when trying to sit down with a buddy, it gets old fast. Maybe if there was a countdown before the round started, or if there was a non-timed mode. I'd recommend it for some arcadey fun with a friend, but at this stage, there isn't a lot of depth.
