Early Access Review
Short game time is due to the current lack of content, in the time I have spent with this game I've played all the tracks it has to offer, some more than once.Super Indie Karts is an indie racing game similar to the early Mario Karts game that is currently available through Steam Early Access. In Super Indie Karts you play as one of many indie characters and race against seven opponents on a variety of tracks, some of which come from the same games as the characters. Before I get underway I'd just like to point out that this game is still pretty early and is developed by one person so any negatives I mention about the game will have less of an impact on my Verdict than they would if this was a full release title, my review will be updated as the game is updated to reflect and changes made.+Charming pixel graphics+Well designed tracks and characters which fit the pixel art style excellently +Already has a lot of playable characters with more to be added by the time the game releases, many characters come from popular indie titles such as Fist of Awesome and Canabalt+The controls are great (I played using a 360 controller) and the karts feel very responsive+Quite a few different power-ups in the game which are all very good though I would definitely like to see a couple more+A couple of the power-ups have 'action cams' so you can see them do their work which is a fun mechanic+Good soundtrack which fits the game well+Brings back some good memories of the early Mario Kart games-Personally I found it a little bit too easy, even on the hardest of the three difficulties I was still coming first or second without putting much effort in-As mentioned there's not much content at the moment, only four of eight single player Grand Prix's are available to play and the other game modes aren't available yet-It takes about a second for the game to pause after you press the pause buttonWorth Noting:Super Indie Karts will be $5 cheaper upon releaseHere's a short video I recorded of the first Grand Prix event:

Early Access Review
<Disclosure - This review was provided free for review purposes>Super Indie Karts is a back-to-basics kart racer boasting a unique indie roster and vibrant retro visuals. This is a review of the game in early access, so take it with a pinch of salt – all features may be subject to change and improvements – the final product will certainly be better than what is currently on offer. With that being said, let’s get to the review proper.Super Indie Karts should be pretty familiar to anyone who has ever played Mario Kart, Diddy King Racing, Sonic Drift etc. For the uninitiated however, in Super Indie Kart, you compete to come first place against seven other racers on wacky, themed courses filled with obstacles and power-ups. Those looking for a complex, robust driving game should bow out now – SIK doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but can capably hold its own with the kart racing series’ forerunners.Arguably the most important aspect of a racing game should be its controls, and thankfully, SIK controls smoothly for the most part. Taking corners can be quite tricky at first, and the drift function seems to be primarily used for the boost it grants rather than helping to actually make corners. It can take a bit of getting used to for fans of modern racers, but once familiarised with the controls, timing boosts and jumps while dodging obstacles at high speed becomes second nature and a lot of fun. Best played with a controller.The current roster boasts 26 characters, with a further 10 yet to be released making it a really meaty selection of potential racers. Unless you’re a devoted follower of the indie game scene, it’s likely that this will be your first time seeing a lot of these characters, and without knowing who they are and what game they come from, they can seem a little flat, with some characters looking particularly boring or out of place such as Elena or Cannabalt. However, for those in the know, seeing their favourite indie icons racing for victory is sure to be a treat. The overall character design is quite nice, and familiar or not, you’re sure to find a racer that suits you.The courses at present are a mixed bag. Most look well designed with a nice variety in layout and style. The best courses I found where the ones with broad turns and plenty of opportunities for drift boosts. At their worst, the tracks are riddled with sharp, 90 degree turns and littered with annoying, seemingly randomly placed obstacles – I believe the developer plans to tone down these obstacles somewhat, and this would be a welcome boon to the flow of the races.Graphically, the game features bright, vibrant tones and quirky retro sprites, very reminiscent of its SNES era progenitor. All the tracks are displayed in a classic mode 7 style which is rarely seen and old school Mario Kart or F-Zero fans are sure to appreciate. There is also a screen filter option to make the game look as though it is running on an old CRT monitor with screen curvature and scanlines. This is a very nice feature that retro gamers are sure to enjoy and thankfully, it isn’t too distracting to the point where you’ll be at a disadvantage. The retro fan service continues with the option to replace in-game button prompts with SNES, and Playstation button icons – Super Indie Karts is anything but shy when it comes to its origins. The soundtrack is equally charming, featuring a variety of upbeat chip tunes – nothing too standout, but pleasant nonetheless.At present the game is reasonably thin on content with only 15 available tracks, no multiplayer races and two newly added battle modes. These battle modes consist of the classic arena based combat mode where you attack by firing weapons, in addition to a Fist of Awesome inspired punch out mode where players swing for each other with giant boxing gloves mounted to their kart. While still very rough around the edges, these battle modes could prove promising and will likely be an enjoyable multiplayer experience. There are no unlockables yet meaning there is no incentive to racing beyond the race itself – If planning to buy this game anytime soon, be prepared for a brief experience.There’s not much more to say about Super Indie Karts, in the brief time I spent playing I had exhausted most of the available content and without multiplayer I would be unlikely to revisit it again for a good while, as content slowly builds up. Super Indie Karts is an enjoyable experience and a solid kart racer in its own right, and when finished, should be a very fun, expansive party game. However, at the moment, the only incentive to buying this game is to support the devs and get early impression/give feedback. The game's current price wil be the same upon release, so my advice is to hold off on a purchase unless you’re desperate for some retro kart racing action.Pros:+Great pixel graphics+Large roster of characters+Fun, classic kart racing.Cons:-Thin on content-Lack of multiplayerTentative Score: 7/10If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

								Note: This review is a little outdated... long story short, I need a new laptop to re-review this game.This is one of the greatest Mario Kar- F-Zero clones i've EVER played.PROS:-The game looks BEAUTIFUL.-The speed. It goes so fast that I can't even stop myself from comparing it to F-Zero more than Mario Kart. And that is BY FAR one of this game's strongest points.-A LOT of less known Indie Games could really get out there from this.-It's really quirky, especially those items!-Though i'm REALLY waiting for Carol to get into the roster, I'm enjoying playing as Lea from Cross Code and Tim Burr from Fists Of Awesome (Two games I don't know a thing about).CONS:-Something that you should have from the get-go of EVERY kart racer, even if it's in Early Access, TIME TRIALS, isn't playable at the moment.-Titus from Indie Assault is in the roster-The tracks are kinda short.I'm really looking forward to this game. It looks AMAZING, and the flaws aren't really that bad (except the Time Trials one).FINAL VERDICT:""Keep up the good work Mac.""~Doc Louis, Punch Out! "

								Fun! While Super Indie Kart still in early access and not completely finished the game is pretty awesome so far.Pros:+Fun, Funny and Split screen multiplayer.+Supported PS3, PS4 and Xbox One Controller 100%(didn't try a 360 Controller) +Great music.+Stages are creative and themed+Lots of characters with their own character theme.+some of the maps are very solid.+Retro/Classic gameplay and feel. Cons:-Early access has a few bugs where you might get knocked through a wall. -Mini map and turning points can be awfully confusing.-Not online Multiplayer.-Not much or complete lack of a story or incentive for these characters to race each other.-Reused sound effect for certain character jumping, same sound as the steam default message received notification (you might alt tab thinking you received a message).   Wonderful game, Cannot wait to see what’s still to come.			"

Before I say anything, I'd like to make it clear I did enjoy this game, I just wouldn't reccomend you to buy it.I loved zipping around the track, and I have a soft spot for any game that let's me play as Carol Tea of Freedom Planet, even if that does make me someone usually avoided at parties. Infact, the whole character set is actually pretty great, and aside from a few visuals, such as the melon-with-a-face (used in-game as a menu cursor among other things), which are awkwardly smooth for a retro-style video game, the graphics are absolutely great. It's deffinitely a fun game to look at. That's where the ""but"" comes in, and this is a big ""but."" It's a lot of fun to look at, but a lot less so to play. That's because this game cannot decide if it wants to be Mario Kart on the SNES or Mario Kart 8; the courses themselves are more like the SNES game, being flat and often very blocky, with only about half of the tracks having any real smooth turns. The turning controls themselves are also very comparible to SNES Mario Kart, being somewhat slidey and slow (though arguably a little too slow), but allowing for brisk and speedy turns using a slide. However, while these two design choices work well with each other, they're both made near-unenjoyable by the fact that rather than making the karts move only at a reasonable speed as in the SNES Mario Kart, allowing players to better judge turns and react to the other racers and track hazards without being hindered by the slower turning speeds, the game decides it needs to try to keep the player's attention by making every car go extremely fast. This leads to the problem that due to the slow turning and the quick speeds, by the time you notice an obsticle it's already too late to really avoid it. This, combined with the fact that the blocky track designs often require tight 45 degree turns, means you'll be hitting things a lot. This game has potential, but either they need to slow down the gameplay, or completely redesign the tracks.			"

								Let it be known my favorite racing franchise was Mario Kart. The biggest thing that bugged me in that franchise was the AI was horrible, That's not the case in Super Indie Karts. This game has been one of my favorites on Steam in awhile. But I highly recommend if your a fan of Mario Kart check this out. Also I love the large amount character selection But with so many I wish they had individual stats or a special move to make them stand out.			"

								After almost 2h of playtime, I managed to beat all cups in 50cc (didn't play mirror yet). Here are my first impressions:+ It captures the feel and look of Super Mario Kart pretty well!+ Nice character and track variety+ you have multiple objectives in a race. Get first, collect the mushroom and collect a specific amount of money during the race. This is optional and raises the rank you earn at the end of the cup+ All the game modes you expect from Mario Kart are there, GP, Time Trial, Battle, Versus, ...+ the music is awesome!- the tracks are super colorful and full of hidden ways, items and other things. You feel really lost and need to learn every track before being able to get first everywhere- the developers really overdid it in terms of shortcuts. On some tracks, you can just use one shortcut after another until the end of the lap. Feels like every curve has 2 ways to drive it. Because of that you never know if you're driving the correct way. It's a bit too much- some soundeffects are really loud- drifting feels very unusual and needs some time to get it right. Doesn't feel as natural as Mario Kart at the beginningOverall I'm enjoying this game a lot. Most of my cons can be solved by the player by simply learning the tracks and the controls. Which is OK for a singleplayer game, but I feel like a Mario Kart-clone needs a better accessablity for new players.It doesn't really feel like an early access title to me, but it's strange that (at this moment) half of the tracks have no game references and are just colorful tracks. I also learned about many other promising indie titles with this game.I can definitely recommend this game!			"

								When I first saw Super Indie Karts, I thought it was kind of interesting since I like to play racing games. I was kind of disappointed when it didn't make its goal at first. When the Kickstarter re-emerged, I decided to back it and was happy when it made it. The game itself boasts Mode 7-style tracks, which I like since Super Mario Kart is one of my favorite classic games and I like Mode 7 being utilized in various ways. The racers consist of original characters and characters from various indie games such as Teslagrad, the Adventures of Pip, and Runbow.Currently, the game is in Beta and has several things missing (i.e. Time Trial, several cups, characters, etc.). Grand Prix  and Battle Mode are available for right now. Unfortunately, I only played Grand Prix since Battle Mode requires at least two players. Grand Prix consists of eight cups (five of them are playable) and three classes that have their own difficulty. Winning first place is the not the only objective here because you can collect Race Jewels and Golden Shrooms (which are similar to the Star item from Mario Kart series) to increase your overall rank for the cup.For the Grand Prix gameplay, you race against seven CPU racers in high-speed races and you can hinder them with items such as melons or homing coconuts. You can also perform drifts for difficult turns and speed boosts. I enjoy the gameplay since I love to go fast and avoiding danger on the track. However, you have to be on your toes when you want to achieve the highest rank. Be prepared for the races as you the CPU racers will give it their all to take first place from you. It can be fun and frustrating, especially in later classes. The graphics in the game is colorful and each character is sprited differently (some have a more 3d feel to them). There are 3d walls and 2d obstacles/hazards that can accommodate to the theme of each track as well. For Music/Sounds, I really enjoy the music of the game (especially Runbow Road), but the Golden Shroom theme playing at the same time as the current music is rather bothersome. Also, the voice grunting in the game is in most cases so-so. Doesn't really bother me, though. The controls are alright once you get the hang of it.In conclusion, if you love classic wacky racers such as Super Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing and enjoy some of the indie games, then give this game a whirl. There will be news tracks, characters, and more in the future.			"

								Pros:+Solid controls+A lot of love and care went into making the characters and stages authentic+Nice graphics+Minimal glitches+Nice music+An interesting spin on Mario Kart's gameplayCons:-No offense to the games' developers, but a lot of the characters featured are...not really notable. Canabalt, Duck Game, Guacamelee, Freedom Planet, Adventures of Pip, Shutshimi, Teslagrad, and Runbow are the only games featured that I've even heard of. I mean, I'm sure that the developer for this game approached some of the more recognizable developers and got turned down, but even so, the roster is a little underwhelming.-In fact, it kinda seems like some of the characters are just there to fill roster space. I don't know what Toto Temple Deluxe is, but for some reason it gets four separate characters that each have their own character slot.-That's another thing: there's a really noticeable unbalance in how much representation each game gets, especially in terms of characters. The Toto Temple Deluxe thing I mentioned earlier is the most flagrant example, but there are other games that, in my opinion, probably should only have one character representing them. But I guess it's kinda too late to change that.			"

								Still Early Access game but with a great potential!Old game style and retro-style characters but with higly detailed 3D racetrack; the ''Power-Up'' are real classics but they could really change an entire race, even the tracks are full of tricks (Watch out for the Runbow Racetrack!).The most interesting thing of this game is not to only race and win to achieve the best score, but also you need to collect crystals and golden mushrooms (believe me....you need a sharp eye) during the race to collect stars in order to take the best score: the coveted A+++.Sounds easy enough? No......This game will make all your previous experience with similar games, such Mario Kart, into a real hell of concentration, nerves......and make you really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when you lose.			"

Early Access Review
								I was hesitant to buy an early access game after being told by so many people not too, as they are not finished and some developers do not finish, but for £6.99 with decent enough content to get my moneys worth already I went for it, and how many bugs can a Karting game have anyway?I am glad I went ahead and got the game, as love Mario Kart and wanted something similiar without bothering with emulating Mario Kart, as I always found Mario Kart very very easy (And I am by no means a good 'gamer', I am very casual).The find the challenge of the courses better then on Mario Kart, and love the soundtrack as well.Apparently online is coming in June or thereabouts.One thing I would like to see added is more weapons, as they are not as good or fun as in Mario Kart.But overall, loving how the game is, from the shoddy graphics to the soundtrack to the courses.Well worth £6.99.

								Got this game after I saw it, I HAD A BLAST! The game is hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, ITS SUPER FUN! I've played battle mode with a friend and we laughed so hard, battling each other and slipping on ice cream! If you are playing with others, don't use the keyboard! Using the controllers makes it feel playing mario kart on a portable console on the go, and so there won't be so many hands on the keyboard! XDDefinitely recommend! C: Developer: I also had a suggestion, if its possible to bring one of the unturned guys from unturned into the game! It will be awesome if that gets added in! \^-^/			"

								A fun little tittle that's not entirely like, but not un entirely like, Mario Kart. The TV filter is nifty and makes me wonder what other filters might be added later for other nostalgia attempts. It does what it comes to do, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun. Looking forward to the new content coming and even the runbo track I hate made me laugh.Looking for another kart game that brings back the SNES style, enjoyed the other kart games like sonic's racing tittles? Well your next kart game has drifted into early access. Looking forward to playing this one online. Least I sure hope that online comes through. Everything else seems well under way, even the pitfalls of the game can be something to laugh at.Another thing to mention is that it doesn't seem to suffer from trying to push the same racers unrealistically to winning, meaning you can indeed play the game's point system realistically for the cup win without getting first place every time. At least so far. Something I believe well worth mentioning with rubberbanding mechanics past.When you hit your speedy stride here, you feel that rush, even just starting with the 50cc, you're already having fun.If I were to nit pick here, only a few of the characters I'm fond of so far, but there are still some there, and the sound ballancing feels like it needs a little work. That and though the control design as is, is more than functional, I want the ability to re map my controller. In this day and age, there's just no reason not to have the likes in the final product. Despite that, well worth the ten bucks, a steal if on sale, and a modern twist on a classic look with new track ideas that brings it's own flavor. This tittle is D bad friendly, yet analog ready.

								I must admit, I like this game a lot, from the mariokart like gameplay, to the simple yet challenging track design. My only complaint is there are too many VR tracks, and VR doesn't mean to much as me as A. I don't own A VR headset and B. I don't want one as it makes me motion sick. However it is still a great game for only $10(I bought this in 2016).			"

								I haven't had this much fun in a racing game in years, Super Indie Karts is really impressive and I highly reccomended. The only downside is Online Multiplayer which I hope gets released with the full game. But other than that, the graphics are beautiful, the character selection is huge and awesome (Duck is my fave), the music score is amazing, the items and game mechanics fit perfectly with the games overall theme, the tracks are fun and chaotic and the controls are great, but may need time to get use to. Well done One Legged Seagull for creating one of the craziest indie kart racers of this year. Keep up the good work!!SparkWolf			"

								Yes Please! Without a doubt one of my favorite racing games. The 8-bit art style in this game is just phenomenal. Soundtrack? Amazing. An easy comparison for this game would obviously be Mario Kart 64, but with added unique elements. Another plus of this game would probably be the awesome cast of characters because they are all apart of your favorite indie games! Honestly, I do strongly suggest you get this game but, you might just want to wait until it is out of Early Access, because there is some features that are a still a work in progress. So, when you play it, you'll get full satisfaction and appreciation this game easily dishes out.			"

Early Access Review
								[EDIT: 03. 01.2017]Onscreenbuttons for the controller work, although the controller isn't automatically detected, but quite a few controller layouts are supported, for example PS4, SNES or OUYA layouts![ORIGINAL REVIEW]This isn't flatout bad, and I can see why people enoy this. But I have seen better.First of all, while my wired xbox-controller worked fine, the on-screen keycommands were still displayed for the keyboard.  And while it's not rocket science to figure three buttons out, it still holds back the ""pick-up-and-play""-aspect I expect from a kart racer.The gameplay is very similar to the original Mario Kart. You drive, you throw things, you try to win. The controls, in my opinion, feel a bit floaty and lack the grip of similar kart racers, but maybe that's just me. What this game offers is challenge. The tracks are harder than you might expect, with a lot of sharp turns, many jumps, and an abundance of obstacles. And it doesn't help that, when you get hit, your driver AND the camera spins around, leaving you guessing whether you are still looking in the right direction.As for the tons of tracks and crossovers (SO MANY CHARACTERS!), it doesn't add much to the game. Every track and character feels pretty much the same. The idea behind the VR-TRAX, which are maybe 70 % of the tracks in the game, is that they look like tron-style meshes in different colours. I was underwhelmed.There are other aspects I don't like, for example the toned down music, the AI that seems as helpless as I am and so on, but I just wanted something quick, easy and fun to play with friends or alone. But apart from screaming ""LOOK AT ALL THESE INDIE GAME CROSSOVERS"" right in my ear, this doesn't offer much to me.			"

								This game is so awesome and beautiful I love the game and it's characters and I love the levels my favorite levels are the Power Drive 2000 level and the Freedom Planet Level and the Read Only Memories LevelMy favorite characters are the Car from Power Drive 2000 and Turing and Carol Tea and the cyborg girl from Cross Code (Cross Code is a game I really want to get)I would love it if they made it have a casual mode in the options so that casual gamers can beat the game easier and I wonder how you unlock characters.I do wish the game has more characters like more Freedom Planet characters like Sash Lilac and Milla Basset and Lord Brevon and Spade and Torque and other Freedom Planet characters and I also wish there were more read only memories characters and other Indie Game characters and I wish there were more stages like more Freedom Planet stages made into Super Indie Kart race tracks like Dragon Valley and the final Freedom Planet stage Brevon's ship and I also wish that some of the ancient temple stages are made into race tracks in this game and I also wish that more locations from Read Only Memories were made into race tracks but anyway I love this game and recommend it to all Mario Kart fans			"

								The game is just like the original mario kart, but different, good and bad. The tracks look great and have great music, but I think that either make the tracks bigger or extend the lap count because it feels a little to short for my taste. The character selection is great and has lots of options. I would like if you added a character from Gang Beasts, it would make my day. The controls are nice except the drifting. It feels too floaty and it is difficult to start a drift. One more thing I would like you to add is local multiplayer in racing and in the battle mode up to four players. I would also like to choose which courses I like to play. All in all, it is a great game, just add and tweek a few things			"

								A Fun little Top-Down Kart Racer much like Super Mario Kart or Konami Krazy Racers. Shows a lot of promise so far but my biggest problem with it right now is that the controls for it are reeeeeally slippery. Like I can't begin to tell you how many times I fell off the track because of how tight certain turns can be, and your karts just weren't built with those kinds of turns in mind.That aside, if they can fix that issue in a future update then I will say this product is well worth its price ~			"

								Pretty decent kart racer designed to resembled Super Mario Kart art first glance, but actually houses more refined mechanics. Its current state as of this writing however is very work-in-progess as the stage count and character select are unfinished, and both time trials and online multiplayer are just currently absentWhat I feel will make or break this game for most are the indie games being highlighted here, which can be a very mixed bag. Absent are many ""Indie Superstars"", leaving Juan from Guacamelee as the highest profile name present, with some other notable characters like Carol Tea from Freedom Planet as a runner-up name the average consumer might have a chance of recognizing. I must stress the roster still isnt done, so there is a chance for ""Big Indie"" names like Shovel Knight, Skullgirls, or Shantae to possibly grace the game but I wouldn't recommend buying the game banking on the unknown.Its in a decent enough state for some good local fun, but hold off for now if you want to play online.

								Game isn't 'bad', but it isn't great either! Alot of mediocre indie characters, from what are considered by most people shovelware, there's probably around 3, 5 at most, indie characters that are from GOOD indie gamesA.R.E.S? Fist of Awesome? ewww. Wasted oppertunity for a SMK style game with indie characters, in Mario Kart the characters are iconic, we've had alot of fantastic and iconic indie games over the years and practically none are in this game sadlyAlso, while it is somewhat a good SMK clone, its gameplay is somewhat flawed, someone else points it out alot better in their review but the karts go much faster then they do in SMK dispite the game having similair track designsAnother reason I'm giving this a thumbs down is due to the developer ignoring customer feedbackHere he is saying he'd consider putting a cheat in, re-adding the original look, but it would add a whopping 50mb to the game, yes a whopping 50mbhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/323670/discussions/0/359543951706265641/Now here he is, months later.. Saying it'll never be possible, due to this game being on the Ouya.. That means he has to have a strict limitation on file size http://steamcommunity.com/app/323670/discussions/0/135507403157130368/I suggested he could add it as a cheat for PC only, and ignore the limitations of the ouya holding the game back, but I never got a replyI simply can't recommend a game that won't get new content added 'based on the fact it's on some weird console', his priorities for this game are very strangeI DONT UNDERSTAND WHY 50MB HAS TO BE SUCH A BIG DEAL			"

								For a game that's trying to be like Super Mario Kart mixed with Konami Racers, it sure fails hard at it. Let me count the ways!The AI is faster then it should be on some tracks while also slower on others.You slide like your on ice with every small turn, more so then Super Mario Kart.Drifting slows you down, forcing you to snake with level 1 boost.Everything bounces you everywhere.Weapons and hazards are too powerful, slowing or dead stopping you longer then you should be.No invulnerability frames after being hit meaning damage stacks.Heatseekers used in first place hunt down second place.Using controller causes shots to be fire backwards more then forward.Every track feels small and cramped.The first cup is way harder then any of the other cups.Duck Stage is a mess, even the AI can't complete it.Runbow Stage is broken as it places you super close to the color you need to stay way when you fall, forcing you to fall in the holes again.The only recognizable characters (IMO) are Carol Tea, Juan, and Duck but even then; You cannot identify anyone from behind them.I do not recommend getting this ""game"" even if your a fan of any of the characters found in this ""game"". Go buy Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed if your looking for a good ""Kart-Racer"" on PC.			"
