												Think the alternate version of Mario Kart for PC. This is a fast paced, balanced game which has alot of different game modes (stunts, traditional racing, sports, arcade). You can fully customize your kart and player sometimes resulting in hilarious and ridiculous creations. It is definetly meant to be played with friends as it is way better (AI can be as smart as a banana) and there are no active servers. Hours of pure and legit fun.			"

												I first played this game back in 2010 free weekend offer.... I enjoyed it a lot, I saw this on steam Summer Sale for 99c bought and soon realized that this game has been abandoned. It's very difficult to find a server but for 99c it’s worth it. What I'd recommend is pick this game up on sale with your mates you'll enjoy it DO NOT pay full price for this as i mentioned it is abandoned by the community and the developer. I discovered there were only 15 maps. Considering all the mini games (which do get somewhat repetitive) are included in this list of 15, that leaves less than 10 maps to actually race on, but you can't go wrong with 99cent for this....

												A fun low-budget multi-player arcade racing game similar to Mario Kart.Surprisingly, it features many game modes, which not always involve racing per se. The controls are arcade-ish and the power-ups are always fun to use against your peers: ""EAT DA LOVE BOTS FOOLS!! MWAHAHA<3"" (there's an achievement for this). Customizing your vehicle and avatar is enjoyable as well - just take a look at what people posted on the steam hub!Unfortunately, they never added new content and the game is no longer supported by the developers. Although the game is moddable, it never really got any attention from the modscene.Buy the 4-pack (during winter/summer sale, it usually goes for US$4) to play with your friends since most public servers are deserted nowadays.

												The physics are terrible and the multiplayer is dead but this is a fun game to mess around in if you have friends to play with. For a low budget game it has a bit of variety. Its offers racer customization, a stunt mode, and goal mode which is similiar but is done better in rocket league.			"

												The Extreme Paintbrawl of kart-racers. You're stuck with the AI since the community (rightfully) died and said AI can be gamed to always lose if you just hit escape and go into the menu. They begin running directly forward and never changing direction.Custom servers also a crapshoot - it refused to let me play another mode/level than ""Punchbowl"" and ""tag"" no matter what I set it to.I didn't really think people needed to be warned away but damnit, if I'm gonna play this for a bit, I'm gonna write about it too.

												Zero Gear is a cart combat multiplayer online party game. Its more than eight player racing, the maps have a variety of objectives such as three-on-three European and American football. There are battle modes such as using boxing gloves to knock other cars over the edge of a sumo ring into the abyss below. Other maps are skeeball and even a pachinko machine with your cars. Its a true party game for anyone that has seven other friends online with this budget game. The game does offer a four pack for the price of two, which is always incentive. If you have no friends, the real problem is that five years after its release, there is no one playing.The game plays easy with an accelerator, a nitro boost, a mini jump for sharper turns. You can gain nitro by drafting behind other competitors or touching a floating dreidel. In fact almost touching it is good enough. The boost will put you at your top speed in an instant rather than slowly increasing speed or shooting you forward, so its just as useful to use the boost when you've got the minimum or maximum amount. In other words, just hold down that boost button. If you ever fall off a track or stray too far from the path, you can use a respawn button. There is optional full mouse camera support and even a free aim button so you can target another competitor.Like all cart combat games you have weapons. In this case there are two buttons to use a weapon in front or behind you. Its shallow in term of weapon variety and you get them by driving through hovering boxes. There is a bubble shield, a boxing glove, a pink love robot that will follow and then hug on the nearest driver until it explodes. You can also get a mine to drop, and a tornado that will throw anyone caught in its winds. Ice blocks will freeze an enemy and send them gliding forward with no ability to turn. Even frozen in ice, their tires will spin, so that feels like an overlooked detail.Perhaps the most context sensitive item to use is the spring that lets you jump. While the spring can be used to jump over things, I consider this to be more useful for doing backflips and barrel rolls to get more boost. When you're in the air with any jump, you have full tilt control of your vehicle.If you're all alone you can play with bots, but victories feel hollow without a single player campaign or cup of any sort. You can setup quick matches and assign the fifteen events you want to play. With the quick matches its just you and three other bots playing the same even twice for whatever reason before you progress to the next map. You can always setup a more complex server, but it takes a bit longer.In terms of customization, you have a lot to chose from. Your car, your gear, your helmet and your face wear. Everything is customization and adds a lot of silly character to the game to make you stand out from the pack online. You can be a hovering brain wearing a clown nose with blonde pig tails driving a boat car. A nice option is randomization, so you can end up with a pink squid wearing a moon helmet driving a bomb with spike tires. Speaking of spike tires, when you use them, you can tell if you let off the accelerator the tires stop completely even if you continue to move forward.As for the tracks themselves, the races are all closed circuits with only two or three laps. The shortest course has eight laps, but it feels like a strict circle.The driving surfaces are needlessly wide so the focus is more on the weapons instead of the driving skill. Each course has a few ramps and jumps here and there. You'll even go down a bumpy ski slope, a wavy slide and a water slide. Each course is bright and colorful. Its all very appealing to the eyes to make that quick fun joy ride feeling.There's a lot of creativity with the courses, a pool and water slide, driving on a billiard tapble that connects to an air hockey course. Even the standard race track circuit shows a lot of flair. The desert themed track has you racing outside and then through a crystal mine across wooden roads. The creativity and effort shows, but the thing that holds the design back in my eyes are the lack of hazards. There's a dirt stadium that could use some slowing mud. These wide tracks just need something else on them like a shallow river. The water park has a lot of water, but it has no affect on you even if the water slide can rotate you backward as you go down..Then there are quirky events such as the basketball, American and European football events that have you trying to score a goal with a gigantic sports ball. While I like the idea, the practice of it in Zero Gear is lacking, its dull and imprecise. Speaking of dull, nothing can trump the tag chase event in terms of boredom. The tag chase has a timer where only one person's time increases. The one that fills their meter first wins the event. Well this takes forever, because everyone else's meter goes down. To make things interesting, the mode will change where the one that is it will decrease in time, making a long mode even longer. These cars are so tiny on such an open wide map that its tough to tag anyone. If the person that's it falls off the level, its up for grabs in the center again.While a lot of the other events are fun and unique, they feel thrown together such as the pachinko and skeeball games. These are simple games based on points. You use your car to drive off a cliff or ramp and fall down into the pachinko or fly into the skeeball. The skeeball feels like skill, the pachinko feels like dumb luck. This is strictly filler content to flaunt as a frill.There is controller support, just not in the menus. Default controls needed to be adjusted because some of the buttons were forgotten about. Even adjusting the controls, there is no menu button to adjust, so there's no pause with a controller. In fact there is no pause, because an online game keeps going even with bots. Instead there's a menu with no way to rebind the menu.Zero Gear feels like it can benefit from from better events and a single player series of races against more intelligent opponents. There is something good here, but it needs to go deeper and bigger. More weapons, more races, more hazards. I'm sure it was fun when its multiplayer was still alive, but with such a small budget game, I wonder how alive it ever was. The game lives and dies on its multiplayer. Judging from the 25% of people with the first achievement, people went into the game, saw that its multiplayer only and went right back out.			"

												This game is kind of fun with many different game modes (some are very boring, others not so much.) The thing is, you can't play in single player if you aren't connected to the internet which means you have to be connected  to the internet at all times in order to play. honestly, that is the main reason I dislike this game. the graphics are OK, however, the colors on some maps are way too bright; I had to adjust the color settings on my monitor (I would go blind otherwise).

-Quick Review-Zero Gear is an indie Racing game, the community is pretty much dead, but if you don't feel like you've had enough kart games, here you go, just for you.Disclaimer: I'm voting it down *not* because it's a bad game, but because the community is dead, you will play by yourself 9 times out of 10. (Maybe you don't mind that? Maybe you want to play a racing game by yourself? Go ahead and get it, lol)-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Instead of a telling the gist of the story (there is none) I'm going to tell my own story. The first time I loaded this game I listen to the soundtrack and though ""Woa! This sound really good"" I called my brother over and said ""doesn't that sound like it has good potential?""I clicked ""quick game"" and BAM all my hopes and dreams were crushed... This was in fact... a racing game.To provide a back story, I've always strongly disliked racing games and driving games. But Saints Row 3, Mafia 2, and Just Cause 2 have all forced me to learn how to drive in video games.Game Play: The first game I played was some type of ""Soccer"" (or ""Football"" for those whom aren't in the USA), this is probably the worst game in the batch. There are several game modes: Tag, Race, and Soccer. All of these can be played and learned, however it takes a bit of getting used to the turning style... Much to my frustration when learning the basics of the game.Soccer/Football/Hockey, your goal is to get the ball/puck into the other team's goal (pun intended).Race is where you drive in circles for a few laps and try to beat the NPC's, because humans don't play this game anymore.Tag, for those of you with no childhood; is when you run away from one person because he/she was designated being ""it"", whatever it is, who knows? In this game it's reversed. You WANT to be it, so you can score points and win.Achievements: There are 45 Achievements in Zero Gear, Most of them are easily obtainable, however a number of them are bugged, and still more require the assistance of one friend.Price the price for Zero gear, is $4.99 that's pretty fair, if you really want this game just wait for a steal sale, you can probably pick it up for a couple dollars.Conclusion: AHHH a racing game. *deletes the devil from my computer*Again, I'm giving it the thumbs down because most people probably won't want to spend time playing this game. The game works, and I could go one way or another, but with my friends interest in mind; probably should just skip this game. You could get a more delightful indie games for the same price.			"

												I recommend this game, but there are a few bad things to mention:1.) There's rarely any servers.2.) If you play with friends, and host your own server, there might be major server lag.3.) I think it's been abandoned by the devs, so basically your going to get what you get, and you can't throw a fit.Some upsides:1.) There is currently a dedicated server set up by someone that runs continuously and has almost no server lag.2.) It's extremely fun if you can get a bunch of friends together to play. Imagine Mario Karts, but on PC and focused around online multiplayer.It's probably best to only get it if you have friends you can play with. I think this game is definitely worth the $5.			"
