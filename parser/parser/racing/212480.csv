												You won't believe it... but, this is the best arcade racing game in the recent years.The transformation mechanics looks gimmicky, but it really matters and makes the game more interesting. You must not only learn handling the cars: boats and planes control extremely differently each other making the game more deep and enjoyable.The tracks are extremely well designed, both visually and technically. There are some noob friendly courses like Carrier Zone and some strongly skill indexing ones like Burning Depths or Adder's Lair. Tracks are also changing lap after lap, which is very refreshing to the standard racing formula.For many people this game may be very hard to complete on 100%. The AI isn't messing around - you WILL get hurt. But, you need to know - winning in this game is SO satisfying. You must fight all the time and even is you lose 9 times, then the 10th winning attempt will greatly repay you above your former investment. This is highly skillful game - the difficulty curve ends EXTREMELY high unlike other new racing games.NO BLUE SHELL. Automatic positive. Weapons are very well balanced for the kart racing. There is still bit of luck, however is less emphasized than in the other games from this genre.The main draw of this game is an online mode. When it works fine it is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunely there are many disconnection and lag problems that may make you Rage Quit for a while. That's not good by any means, but there is a high chance that you will get over it. The community is handling some bi-weekly tournaments so don't forget to drop on by!Overall, game is remarkably fun with bunch of refreshing mechanics that you will love to explore and use for your advantage. I highly recommend this game, especially for non-Sega fans, because this game is far FAR more than a simple fanservice you would expect.			"

												Imagine driving through a port that has airships docked. When the port ends, you drive off of a cliff only to have your car turn into a jet. After you come down and complete a lap expecting to see the same thing, a giant airship has crashed into the port. Forcing you to drive into a path unknown, the river below where your car morphs into a boat. Mines drop into the water, sending waves that you and your rivals then need to traverse the dynamic water. On your third lap around, the airships get engaged in battle and have completely destroyed the port, causing you to have to fly through burning airships and find your way around the crashing behemoths. As you're dominating the competition on the third lap, you can hear the fans chant your name.This is Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed. Every race might be three laps with many paths, but the second and third laps usually deviate in a big way from the first. You won't just be driving cars around the 20+ courses (40+ with mirrored mode), but you'll be piloting ships and jets. The tracks are gorgeous. Themed and inspired from classic SEGA games like Sonic, Super Monkey Ball, Shinobi, Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, Afterburner, Nights and many more. Even lesser known games like Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg get their own track. A lot of love and detail went into this game and it shows. Bright colors for some tracks, realistic lighting and texture for others. There is something here for everyone. The controls are easy yet difficult to master. Left thumbstick to steer, a button to use items, a button to look back, right stick to do tricks in mid air, right trigger to speed up and left trigger to slide / drift. Drifting around corners will not only tighten your turn radius, but if you hold it for long enough, it will boost your speed when you come out. Every character has his or her own stats: Speed, acceleration, handling, boost and all star. These stats balance out drivers. The All-Star determines how frequently you will get it from the items. When you have it, you're temporarily turned into a jet.Since this is a 'kart' style game, there are items that you'll pick up from floating red orbs. The fire crackers launch forward and bounce off of walls.  There are ice balls that come in threes and will first stun opponents. Hitting them with more ice freezes them longer. A hot rod that will give you a temporary speed boost and you can detonate it, making a ring of fire around you. A drone that will follow the driver you've selected. You can even change the driver by pointing at a new one. A simple speed boost. A spiked blowfish that you can leave on the course. Finally, one of the most creative weapons, a swarm that will charge forward and will put giant wasps on the course. It will cause drivers to weave through them.Each of these weapons can get fired ahead of you or behind you. Making everything valuable and useful. How do you defend against all these things? Well you can evade them, but there is also a glove that will catch projectiles. Not just that, but then you can throw them back.With all these weapons, they don't feel like they'll cause a winner. The game still feels skill based. The last driver won't get an item that will drop them off at first place. There is no item that will seek out and rob whomever is in the lead. It is possible that you can take such a lead that no weapon can overtake you, only your own bad driving will lose you the lead. You can also fall so far behind that nothing will bring you to the others.As you play through the game, the characters you play as will get experience. When a character levels up, he or she gets a modification. Simple things like handling or speed. They give you an extra point, but because the game feels balanced, they take away a point from something else. It is a nice system, especially when considering multi-player balance.There are boosters marked with purple arrows in the air, water and the track to move you faster. That's not the only way though. When you are in the air, you can do a trick by using the right thumb stick. If you land the trick you get a boost. If you fail, you get slowed down. The game avoids crashes. Even if you fly off the track, the screen just wipes and puts you back in the game. The tricks have another purpose when you're in the air. Left and right do barrel rolls. Up and down do flips. This makes sure that you don't jump off the track.Sega makes use of its rich history and there are plenty of drivers. Characters from Sonic's series, Crazy Taxi, Super Monkey Ball, Football Manager, Nights, Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon, Rome: Total War, Space Channel 5, Team Fortress 2 (three characters as one), an unlockable famous real life racecar driver and so many more. Wreck it Ralph is even here straight from the animated movie! Even if you've never heard of Sega or Sonic, there's always someone here to recognize. It is a huge roster of drivers and thankfully a lot of them are unlockable throughout the game's various modes.There are career modes that have your typical Grand Prix with 5 cups that have 4 races each. Each race generally lasts around 5 minutes. Complete all 5 of the Grand Prix and earn mirrored track mode. The main game mode is the World Cup that has you participating in a lot of different events for stars. You will unlock events on a sort of map. When you take part in the event you set easy, medium or hard. Each new victory will give you a star. Easy gets you one star, hard gets you three. These stars are to progress and to unlock new drivers.But with the World Cup, you don't just race. There is a whole slew of events. Drifting challenges, time challenges, battle challenges that have you destroying other racers, traffic attacks where you need to dodge other cars, vs races that pit you against another driver, ghost races that have you competing against game developer ghosts, ring races that have you flying through rings and even a perusing a tank boss to destroy it. There is a lot of variety here and I for one appreciate it.On top of that, you have local co-op and online co-op that finds you matches based on what mode you want. There are typical races, battle arenas and a few others. The process is pretty streamlined. You vote on a track from three random tracks. Then select your driver, view their license to see how good your competition is. Then you race to see who is the best.For every achievement you unlock, you get a sticker. You can place 3 stickers on your license as a flaunt or a personalization that tells other players about you at a glance. There is still in depth information to everyone, which is always nice. When you win, your online rating goes up, when you lose it goes down. It is all a nice system.When you head into a race in Grand Prix and multiplayer, you can play a slot machine for buffs. These buffs are things like ice doesn't slow you as much. You get a glove every lap. Things that mix it up, but really doesn't make anyone overpowered. The slot machine is a diversion during the loading screen. How do you get coins for the machine? On the track there are coins every so often that you can pick up. Not just that, but when a driver is hit with a weapon or falls off the track, they leave a coin. This rewards aggressive players. Plus someone else can always sneak in to take the coin.This game has a lot of content that puts it somewhere at the top of the heap when it comes to combat cart racing. While it has weapons, it is skill in the subtleties of the game that will win you races. Every track has its own flair and is a thing of sheer beauty. It is a lot of fun for anyone that needs something different yet similar to Mario Kart. It feels like a genre that was sorely missing from Steam and Sega didn't just fill that void, they hit a home run with it.			"

												My most treasured friend, who changed my life, gave me this game during her birthday. Without me having no idea what it was going to be about, I assumed it would have been another clone of Mario Kart, so I just wanted it for the online. But, I was astonished...YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A KART RACING GAME LIKE THIS.Before I explain why this is my favorite game on steam and my Game of The Year for 2013, I'd like to give a bit of history of my experience with Kart Racing games. I've been a huge kart racing fan since SNES's Super Mario Kart. They're fun to play especially with friends but I felt they lacked something. As technology advance with the introduction of online, modern kart racing games had online sessions where you can play with others. I remember waking up early at 5am to playing Mario Kart Wii to play with a friend via online. It was fun playing with her causally, but when we played 1 v 1. The experience was boring and it felt like just playing a normal racing game since the items weren't made for 1 v 1. This made me realize that the fact is that many contemporary Kart Racing games such as Mario Kart and other MK clones aren't designed to be intense, fast or competitive. If you tried to play competitive 1 v 1, you're going to get a boring experience because modern kart racing games are design to be with 10+ players with explosives items and just pure luck. Basically, anyone can play, blindly, and it manage to win. Some may like it, but I felt it was boring because it lacked challenge.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the exact opposite because it is a immensely fast, competitive, challenging kart racing game. It is a game you can pick up and expect to get your butt kicked at Normal level. If you think Hard is impossible, this game offers Very Hard mode which will test your skills. It requires mastering maps and developing skills while fantastic music playing. It's like if someone mixed F-Zero with Mario Kart.Unfortunately, where the game fails is that it does not any introduction or tutorial. I highly recommend checking out guides before playing. But when you begin to master the game, you'll realize just how good, if not better, competitive kart racing games than causal fun kart racing games.  What Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does what many kart racing games fail such is  combine map advantages, fair items, and skills together. Majority of these maps are designed for a player to use the map at their advantage such as drifting and stunts. Stunts are tricks you can perform with your right analog. Performing more than one will reward a player with a high tier boost. Drifting also plays a key role as if a player has better drifting skills than others, they're able to drift smoothly and avoid crashes and hazards. Mixing the two together can give you a insane amount of speed up to a level 6 boost. If you have some skill in stunts and drifting, you'll be able to destroy any novice played easily and make an entire lobby receive a ""Did Not Finish""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's items are some of the most balanced fair items I've seen on a kart racing game. Any of the items are very easy to avoid just by drifting and preforming a stunt. There items that shoot directly, set traps, or just gain boosts. The most interesting is the Bees or Sky tigers. They can either target first place or shoot back, but what it does is spread a ton of bees that blocks or hits 1st player. BUT, if you're really good at the game, you can drift and slide your way out of the hazard or any item.Being more specific, the game introduces Boats and planes. Boat, for example, is almost like karts, but you use the water at your advantage. You're able to do stunts when falling off a cliff or bouncing out of the waves to gain an incredible amount of speed. In my opinion, boat and kart are very similar. On the other hand, a player can also use a plane where it opens creatively for the player. There are almost no restrictions and you can fly how you want. All three, the player is able to drift, stunt, and preform a variety of skills to gain speed. What makes the game play different from other kart racing games is that the game rewards you for taking risks, which pushes you to try your best and learn how to go faster. If you try to avoid crashes and hazards uses boosts, you get a risk boost or stunt boosts. This gives a player new idea to get better at the game. What I love the most is that there is no ""best"" path or road. Majority of the paths in maps are balanced and you could take any path you want and still win. It all depends on your skills.In addition to all this crazy talk about drifting, stunts, and skills, Transformed's maps are some of the best kart racing maps. Rather than looping around the same track three times, the maps actually change as you progress. While the graphic or textures on the maps aren't that great compare to today's graphics, the map's environment is where it shines. If you notice that majority of the maps have some kind of action going on. Even maps that have the same track such as Carrier zone something happen such as planes flying back and forth while there explosions happening. AND, a huge missiles flies up to the sky. It just looks amazing. There even maps where the track changes entirely. There a map where you're just racing and if you look in the sky, there actually a battle happening, at the same time. In your second lap, the plane crashes and the players racing are force to use the water to continue the race. Just as you reach your final lap, a dragon destroys the track and you have to take plane. It sounds insane, right? Some of these maps, you actually feel like you're playing the actual SEGA game where it came from especially if you played the game such as Nights Into Dream's Dream Valley map. These are seriously some of the most creative unique maps I've ever played on.With great maps comes segantic (fantastic) music! This game offers a variety of abandon songs from Sonic games like You can Do Anything to obscure songs like Carrier Zone to remastered remixes from very old SEGA titles such as Space Harrier. If grew up playing SEGA games, this game will satisfy all your music needs and you'll remember all those valuable moments you had playing your old SEGA games. It does not matter if you played a SEGA game, you'll be nodding your head to the tunes. Some of these songs are addicting such as Race of Ages, Carrier Zone, or Amigo's Spanish song. What I love about these songs is that they improve the game play significantly as they make the game play more suspenseful, intense and climactic. For example, I've played with players who are WAY better than me, but what I was impressed was the fact that I did not care about 1st place. I just wanted to beat the person that was preventing me from getting the closest place. There moments when I was battling against a player trying to keep a place and I eventually beat the person, but laugh when I realized that I was fighting for 4th place. I simply did not care about getting 1st place, it was all about having fun and trying to beat your friends or rivals. I've seriously had some of the best intense moments in this game that no other game can offer. It's like being a driver of the ending of a Fast and Furious movie where it all comes to your skills. What really impressive me is the fact that many players seem to enjoy the game's contribution to old SEGA titles that went and bought old SEGA titles they loved from Transformed. SUMO Digital or SOL did a wonderful job showing their love for their SEGA best classics. You can tell a ton of love, and effort when building this game.Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed should be on history for separating kart racing games from Mario Kart Clones and try something entirely different. Now, there causal racing and competitive racing.			"

												In a time of despair, betrayal and greed within the video game industry, a holy beacon of light appeared out of nowhere, summoned by SEGA.This light was called Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, a game built upon skill, experience and nimbleness. Following the template of ´95 games, this game is the proof of gaming culture reborn. With fantastic music, levels with incredible contrast, and gameplay so amazingly well built, you would be missing out one of the greatest and most fun multiplayer port one could think of. For your own sake, and the sake of realising that high quality games still exists, you need this game more than you think. This game is seriously good. Ever play Mario Kart, Diddy Kong Racing, or Burnout? Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed basically combines all of the good elements of these games, and does a great job of having characters you actually want to see from both in the Sega universe and not in the Sega universe.Most of the item weapons are counterable, INCLUDING the 1st place screw you item: THE BEES THE BEEEESS. I think everyone has a deep loathing of Mario Karts Blue Shell aka “bend over and prepare your ♥♥♥♥” or get into 2nd place for 90% of the race dammit. I am giving the Hot Rod item the screw you award though, it can be extremely cheap. The transform theme also bleeds into the tracks. The tracks actually change shape and even switch up when you transform, and it does it in very creative ways. For example, the one track gets blown to bits by an invading force, making you transform to plane for the last lap. This game easily ranks up there as one of the best goofy kart racers of all time! I mean, really, when this game has Team Fortress 2 characters and Wreck-It Ralph as kart racer options, how can you hate this game? HOW?!			"

												I honestly can't think of any flaw in this game. It sets out to do something and does it perfectly. The graphics are great, the handling is great and track desgin is great. It's just so colorful and bright that it's simply pure joy to play. My only regret is the fact that i'm not too familiar with characters and especially track locations. I know most of the Sonic ones and the Skies of Arcadia one is pure pefection, but some i don't recognize. It offers wide range of chalenges and difficulties for all types of gamers and runs smooth like butter on my piece of crap PC.Definitelly THE kart racer on Steam, I recommend it to anyone who's looking to have some fun.

												Fantastic kart/arcade racer! I bought it on a whim during the Steam Summer Sale and almost immediately became hooked. The way the courses evolve and incorporate the 3 different vehicle types blew my mind the first time I played each, and the controls and gameplay are top-notch in my opinion. Beyond that, having put in 300+ hours, I still have so much to learn to maximize my speed on each track - all the tricks and techniques one can employ to maximize boosts is incredible! On top of all that, there is still an active community for this game that, while not the largest, has been so amazingly helpful and friendly! Only downside is that one does tend to experience a number of network error disconnections while playing online, but usually one can just rejoin the lobby for the next race by simply restarting the game and entering the lobby again.Tl;dr: If you enjoy kart/arcade racers at all, I highly recommend this game!

												I've played this game with a couple of friends a bunch over the last couple of days, and have played a ton of it on a different console, and I can simply say that this might be the best Kart Racer ever made. It takes everything good about Mario Kart, gives you more ways to increase your speed based on your skill, and has many different ways to play any character allowing you to play with anyone you like and have your optimal stats.The course design, give or take a level or two, is always on the point. There's nothing more satisfying than learning a course and being able to flip and drift constantly. The ways the courses are laid out and change really allows you to visually tell how much better you're getting at playing, and it's always a nice feeling.The graphics of the game also manage to shine quite well. With a well optimized engine allowing for nearly anyone to play, it's almost a surprise how good this game manages to look. The small details in everything from the Casino Park level to the Jet Set Radio level pop out quite nicely, and manage to look good even at top speeds.The gameplay of the game is fun, simply put. I really can't think of another way to put it. The items are fun to launch at your friends or enemies, and they can all be avoided with other items or skill. If you dislike Mario Kart simply because of the blue shell, this might be your game. All three of the vehicle types are also perfectly balanced, and feel great to play with. It's just fun watching your car swiftly turn into a plane and then continue flying against your opponents. If you're looking for a game to sit around and play with a bunch of friends online, I would highly recommend this one. It just never gets old.			"

												First off I want to say that I am not a Sonic fan nor really of racing games, yet I loved this game.This game reminds me of Mario Kart, it has alot of elements which need to be mentioned:The level design is great and very creative which also keeps the game from getting dull.Bots have great difficulty adjustments, you will have to work up your skill and learn the game before you can win against the harder AI.The graphics is clear and beautiful with a high definition cartoony smoothed out look, which runs smooth, and should run even on low end machines.The vehicle handling in this game is incredible feels like a real arcade gameFairly balanced customizable characters to choose from heaps from which you will recognise, each having their own vehicle look and transformation which is a nice touch.COOP CAMPAIGN (This is something I haven't seen done much, and it is one of the features which I had the most fun and makes this game stand out from other games in general). The campaign itself is very creative with having modes I have never seen doen before like 'Traffic Attack' (reaching checkpoints dodging traffic) 'Drift mode' (drift on marks on the ground that give you extra time to reach the end) 'Versus' (Go head to head against waves of bots and take them out or get ahead of them before they take you out)  'Boost challenge' (drive over the boost marks on the ground to reach the end before time runs out). So many more.. But what makes this better is that you can do all this with your friends together and unlock new maps and characters which keeps you locked in the game trying to beat bosses and progress through the campaign.The transformation with the kart, to boat, to air vehicle works great and just makes the game more original.A game you should definately play split screen with friends and one you can challenge yourself to reach your All Star potential. 9/10			"

												Likely the best kart racer on PC. Sonic Racing Transformed's gimmick, the changing tracks & vehicle transformations is well executed, with each of the 3 vehicle types (car, boat, plane) feeling different, although the water driving feels a bit iffy. The tracks themselves are also generally very well made, with all of them very closing resembling the stages from the games they take inspiration from.The game also has a pretty good roster of characters from the sega stable, including   characters from sonic, Jet Set Radio, Skyes of Arcadia, and even PC exclusives like Football Manager and Heavy/Pyro/Spy from TF2, and while not that different from eachother, they still have small differences.Lastly, perfomance wise, it's one of the better ports I've seen. PC's from 2008 will run this game just fine @ 60FPS or nearly that with most eyecandy on max.			"

												Am not the best at racing games but this game is sweet. It has a lot of cool, cute and fun characters to play as and a lot of racing maps. I like the graphics, the effects and how friendly it looks but do not be fooled because once the race starts it is WAR. The other races will do what it takes to win which makes it a lot of fun and this is not a typical racing game because some maps you also fly or are on water. This game takes the experience to another level when you play it beside friends! I would recommend this game if it goes on sale but do not pay full price for it.			"

												Absoultely amazing, completely addictive kart racing game that blows Mario Kart out of the water. The Steam version of Sonic and All-Stars racing Transformed is the best one by far, just for being able to run at 60 FPS if you computer can support it. Seriously, it just looks so much faster and feels so much better than the console versions. Gameplay modes include the amazing World Tour, where you take on various missions and collect stars to unlock more characters and modifications for their vehicles. Grand Prix, your standard Mario Kart style mode where you compete in a series of races and try to get more points than the other guys. Time Attack, where you attempt to get the fastest lap on a track. The game also has online matchmaking in the form of standard races, Arena where you can compete in the game's 3 arena modes: Battle Race (like a regular race, but you are knocked out after taking 3 hits), Battle Arena (takes place on special combat-based maps and try to shoot the other guys and stuff), and Capture the Chao (find a Chao and deliver it to its destination, while others try to bump into you and steal it), and Lucky Dip, which is a mix of the two modes and also includes Boost Race (tracks have more boost pads, but no items will spawn). Online is fairly populated in the Race lobby, but seems to be sort of dead on Arena and Lucky Dip. A word of warning: Make SURE you at least play through World Tour before going online! There are plenty of VERY skilled players online, and you'll want a decent grasp of the tracks and the controls before taking them on. Thankfully, the community is one of the best i've seen in any online game; I've nearly doubled my Steam friend list just from playing this! The top players have written plenty of guides for this game if you're having trouble; be sure to check them out.Unfortunately, since this game uses the same peer-to-peer networking as the console versions, lag can rear its ugly head. Its two major manifestations take the form of collisions that send your car flying, and several-second pauses that can throw you off guard. It doesn't happen every race, but it can show up, so be prepared.Overall, just a great game, never thought I'd put so many hours into this, but I just can't stop! VERY recommended purchase!			"

												When this game came free to play for the weekend, I gave it a try, I've enjoyed all the sonic games for the Game boy consoles and thought that I should give this game ago, when I stalled it I was amazed with the graphics in the game; not the best but I think they awesome for the type of game, which brings a lot of visual towards the amount of fun you can have in the game.It's not just racing in your kart, you get vehicle transformation, kart (Land) Boat (Water) Plane (Air) all character will have different vehicles and looks which makes the game more fun.You'll say to your self, I'll do one game on Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed and you'll end up on it for hours.I would also recommend using a controller for this game as you can get a lot more fun out of it... (depends on your gaming style)100% worth buying this game! "

												Why have we not seen a sequal from SEGA yet, it's easily just as good as Mario Kart, probably better for being a much more balanced Kart Racer.Come on SEGA, shut up and take my money, you actually deserve it, I wish I could give you more.9.5/10 Not Perfect, but this games addiction level is over 9000.

												Why do these funny races make me happy? It's impossible not to admire these colorful landscapes. Great tracks: they make real roller coasters out of the game. There is a huge selection of game modes and a variety of characters, not to mention the unforgettable music. It's all about the ease with which you begin to play and that inaccessible level which is required to complete the game!			"

												When most people simply glanced at the game, it is easy to look at it as just another mascot kart racing game.  With character racers like Crash Team Racing, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and especially Mario Kart, one would think that that there is nothing more to do.  However, by taking a closer look, it becomes clear that there is more than meets the eye.While the various characters will get your attention, the vehicles that they drive are the important detail.  Depending on the track, the drivers will use either the classic go-kart, a speedboat, or a fighter jet.  Using various vehicles was used in other games like Diddy Kong Racing, but Transformed taking it a step further.  In most cases, the tracks consist of multiple terrains.  Mario Kart has changing terrains, but your kart does not change with it.  If you go into the water, you end up driving in the water, but it is still in kart form.  If you go into the air, a hang glider comes out to extend your jump, but it still counts as more ground racing instead of real aerial races.  In this game, when going from one terrain to another, the vehicles will change accordingly to match it.  That means if your kart goes into the water, the kart will change into a speedboat.  If you hit a big ramp, it will now become a fighter jet.  With your vehicle changing throughout the race, it makes the vehicles more interesting than usual.The vehicles are not the only thing that transforms in this game.  As you race progresses, the tracks will change along with it, a feature few racers ever did.  In one prime example, Dragon Canyon, each lap has its own feel.  In lap one, you will start by driving along wooden bridges and rock roads.  Partially into lap two, a giant rock will block the road forcing the racers onto an unstable water route with waves, rocks, and waterfalls.  On the final lap, a dragon will blow up the wooden bridge making everybody to take to the skies dodging pillars and monsters.  With an ever-changing track layout, it makes repeating the same track a lot more exciting than other racing games.As with most kart racers, items are a part of the action.  While these weapons make the racing more interesting, they tend to make things unfair.  This is something that this game fixes.  One of these is a weapon that locks onto a racer and seeks it until it makes contact.  In most games, once somebody launches this weapon, all you can do is take the hit.  In here, when the game warns you, it is possible to dodge it with a well-timed boost.  Additionally, another item will allow you go grab them weapon and, if desired, send it back to them.  One more detail about them items is how they are against the leader.  In these games, there is usually a weapon designed to attack specifically the leader.  What makes them bad is that because they are guaranteed to hit the leader regardless of their distance.  This makes it that the game will penalized the leader simply for being in the lead.  Transformed realized this is unfair and fixes it.  With this game, to attack the leader, the weapon used is a swarm of bees.  While they will hurt the leader if they hit, that is not a guarantee.  They work by acting as a series of pillars.  Through skillful driving, it is possible to drive around them unharmed.  By making it that lead targeting item works on skill instead of blind targeting, this makes that if the leader can avoid them, then that person deserves to be in the lead, the way that it should be.Another thing that makes the game stand out are the modes available.  Like any racing them, Grand Prix racing is the main draw of the game.  However, another mode stands out in this game.  In World Tour mode, the game gives various challenges besides simply winning a race.  One on track, dozens of cars will crowd the track making it hard to maneuver.  On another, a tank will try to blast you.  On yet another, the player need to fly through rings that send them both on and off the regular course.  With so much variety, this could have been a game onto itself.  With all the extra challenges, most other racing games pale in comparison.Even though the newest Mario Kart game is about a year newer, this is what it should have been.  Even for those that play on Nintendo systems, this is the superior kart racer to play.  Since this is a multiplatform game, fans of the genre should not miss on one of the best games released in years.			"

												I have never been a fan of any type of racing game, but Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has kept me playing somehow! Commonly referred to as ""Sonic Kart"", Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed carries on the mantle of SEGA's racing franchises, coming after titles such as Outrun and Daytona USA. It features a lot of the characters and locales from alot of SEGA's major and not-so-major franchises (I'm looking at you, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg!).""What does the Transformed in the title mean?"", you might be wondering. To put it simply, each racer's car can transform between a car, boat, and a plane! This makes for some interesting track designs, as portions of each track are land, water, and air-based, and transition between each other very smoothly. It's exciting watching your car morph into a boat or plane without losing any momentum! Sadly, the water segments are the weakest points, as you do not have the traction of the track, and waves don't seem to have any impact on your boat at all. The plane is easily the most fun segment, with the car segments coming second. A major mechanic in the game is ""Drifting"", in which you brake and turn to the side around curves, which after awhile will earn you a boost when you come out of drifting. Using this to your advantage is key to keeping up with your opponents and winning races!With over 20 tracks (40 if you count the mirrored tracks), there is never a dull moment. Tracks also morph and terraform between laps, offering a different experience per lap, and chaning up the land/air/water segments as you go. Tracks range from your typical Sonic locales (Casino Palace, Seaside), to a Panzer Dragoon track, Super Monkey Ball, and Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg. Each track is unique, and they all change as the race progresses.There are many, many characters available to unlock, all representing the franchise they come from. Of course, you have your obvious characters...Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Tails, and Metal Sonic. But there are also characters such as Wreck-It-Ralph, Beat from Jet Set Radio, MiMi from Super Monkey Ball, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Ulala from Space Channel 5, and many more. Exclusive to the Steam version are also the Tactician from Football Manager, the Deadly Assassin from Total War: Shogun, and Heavy/Spy/Pyro from Team Fortress 2. Each one levels up, gaining more ""car mods"" with which you can customize the performance of your vehicle. Your car has a few stats on which it is graded, which can be adjusted with your unlocked mods: Speed, Handling, Acceleration, Boost, and All-Star. All-Star is a special ability unique to each character that can be activated by collecting the appropriate power-up. For example, Knuckles' All-Star ability allows him to use the Master Emerald to conjure a Chaos Blast-like explosion.There are a number of power-ups that can be used, each obtained from a Random Item pickup. Once picked up, a very fast roulette will determine what power-up you receive. This is completely random, and is also the only way to get the All-Star power-up. Examples of some power-ups are Snow (allows you to throw up to 3 snowballs at opponents), Boost (gives you a free, trigger-at-will boost), Fireworks (similar to Snow, but fires a Firework that bounces between walls), and Blowfish (drops a blowfish on the track which stops any racers who hits it momentarily). If you hit an opponent with a power-up like Snow or Firework, they will drop a Coin. These are collected and used to play a slots game before each race, at the cost of 5 Coins per pull. You can obtain a random power-up at the very start of the race in this manner.There are several games modes, including World Tour, Time Trial, Single Race, and Grand Prix. In addition to this, there is a multiplayer that utilizes Steam Matchmaking, so your are never too far from competition!As I said at the beginning of this review, I am not a fan of racing games. But Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed has made me change my mind about racers. They can be pretty awesome when done right, and this game definitely does it right. It's fun, vibrant, and never short on thrills, challenges, or variety. Do check this game out if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.

												Whether navigating the labyrinthine hallways of Curien’s Mansion or dodging the reptilian occupants of Death Adder’s Lair, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the right kind of trip down memory lane. A superior Mario Kart clone and certainly the best Sega has ever produced, especially in terms of the teary-eyed nostalgia inspired by its endless retro cameos.Amazingly beautiful tracks where you race, swim and fly, sometimes changing the level as you progress through it, are what makes this game great.Nostalgia aside, Sonic Transformed as a kart racing game is a blast to play and it comes highly recommended, especially at the reasonable Steam price.

												Admittedly, an oddball in my Steam game library, one filled with gory shooters, slaughterfests, and other such M-rated material, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is like the stray hippie amongst a population consisting of shizophrenic sociopaths! If you don't like long reviews, just skip to the last paragraph, where I summarize everything!I quite honestly don't remember just how exactly this game ended up in my library, but I recently decided to play it anyway.  Because while I may have many games I still need to play out of my library, I've been desiring a decent racing game for quite some time. Did I expect this game to actually fulfill that desire by being anything close to what could be considered a quality racing game that brought me some great amount of entertainment? Honestly, no, I did not.But alas, I was surprised! What I expected to be nothing more than a dumbed down racing experience with unbalanced items and cheesy banter between characters that would make me want to turn this into one of those M-rated shooters I own so that I may claim unsavory vengeance upon them for their horrible forced personalities, turned out to actually be one of the few good racing games I've seen on Steam!How is it good? Well, allow me to explain! Wait... Oh, right, that's what reviews are about... Um... Moving on!From the screenshots, and the involvement of Sonic and co, in a bright and cheerful-looking environment, one may be brought to the understandable conclusion that this game would only be enjoyable if you were young, or the stereotypical ""hardcore"" 50-year old Sonic Fan with no friends, who yells ""You're too slow!"" at every car he drives by on his way to his minimum wage job at the local McDonald's. You would be wrong.Amazingly enough, this game is actually enjoyable regardless of age, and you really don't have to be a fan of Sonic at all to enjoy the gameplay. I'd recommend this game regardless of the age of the player, as it's obviously safe for young kids to play, but definitely offers an enjoyable experience for older players as well (For reference, I'm almost 19).Is it for the ""filthy casuals""? No, not at all! While a casual could definitely get into the game on the lower difficulties that take nearly no skill whatsoever, a pro gamer could easily find a good challenge on the hard, and expert difficulties!My only complaint would be how few tracks there are. A total of 16 new tracks, with an additional 4 classic tracks, plus mirrored versions of all the tracks, and +1 new track with a mirrored version if you get the DLC. Thankfully, the game offers a variety of modes to make this small number of tracks less bothersome. Nonetheless, it is a small amount, and new DLCs with additional tracks are unlikely.Speaking of the DLC, it's not bad, but I certainly wish it offered more than just one single new track. A full circuit of four new tracks would certainly be more appealing. The DLC track isn't really worth it in all honesty, since it's not nearly as interesting as the tracks originally in the game, and there's also a few bugs in it that can be accidentally triggered from time to time (nothing too frequent, so don't worry). Buy it if you really want a new character, and desperately want an extra track. Otherwise, skip it.So, in summary, a great game for all ages (children or adults), and offers a challenge for both casuals and hardcore gamers, providing a small number of tracks, but a fair number of characters, and overall one of the few good racing games on Steam right now.

												Having played several Mario Kart games, I must admit that I enjoy the variety offered by this Sega alternative.  Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed offers customizable vehicles, three different vehicle modes for different terrains, and a large variety of racing modes.  The solo campaign features the expected World Tour, Grand Prix, and Time Attack modes.  Grand Prix and Time Attack are no different than a Mario Kart game, but World Tour has much variety. (Note, the last Mario Kart I played was Mario Kart Wii, so it is possible Mario Kart has since started offering this variety as well.)All-Star Racing Transformed offers several different types of game modes in the World Tour campaign:* Standard Race - 3 laps, use weapons to attack other racers* Battle Race - at most 3 laps, use weapons to attack other racers, 3 hits eliminates a racer* Boost Race - 3 laps, no weapons, lots of boost pads* Boost Challenge - Race through a number of checkpoints before time runs out, time only counts down when you are NOT boosting* Ring Challenge - Fly through a ring course before time runs out* Traffic Attack - dodge through cars to reach checkpoints before time runs out* Drift Challenge - drift through checkpoints along a set path, time only increases when you drift correctly* Versus - 1v1 race, stay in the lead for a set amount of time or get far enough ahead to eliminate the opponent* Sprint - solo race, beat the lap time of a ghost* Pursuit - attack a massive tank that stays in front of you, dodge the tank's attacks, kill it before it kills youMultiplayer retains only the Race, Battle Race, and Boost Race game modes, but it also offers two additional modes exclusive to multiplayer games:* Battle Arena - drive around on a small open map using weapons to attack opponents, 3 hits eliminates a player* Capture the Chao - pick up a Chao creature and bring it to a dropoff area to score, attacking the player with the Chao will cause the Chao to drop and another player can pick it upLiving up to the title, race cars will transform on different levels to account for changes in the course.  Levels feature a mixture of land, sea, and air racing, so you may find yourself driving a car, boat, or plane as you race to the finish.  If cars transforming wasn't enough, the race tracks will also change between laps, so you may find yourself flying in lap 3 even though you used a boat in laps 1 and 2.In addition to the transformations, each driver also has several mods you can apply to the vehicle.  Mods are unlocked by leveling up a driver.  Drivers earn experience for each event they complete regardless of whether or not you win or lose, though you do get much more experience for winning.  The mods may affect each driver's vehicle differently, but in general they take a point away from one category and add it to a different category.  The mods are:* Standard - default stats* Balanced - usually takes a point off the highest stat and gives it to the lowest stat* Handling - takes a point off Speed and adds it to Handling* Acceleration - takes a point off Boost and adds it to Acceleration* Speed - takes a point off Handling and adds it to Speed* Boost - takes a point off Acceleration and adds it to Boost* Console Mod - generally maxes out Speed and/or Boost at the expense of other stats (this mod must be unlocked in the World Tour campaign rather than by leveling up)But how does the game actually play? Is it fun?Short answer: YES!Long answer:It will take you a bit of time to get used to this game.  There are several tricks you'll need to learn to help you race faster, such as knowing how to get the starting boost and when to perform aerial acrobatics, but you will quickly get the hang of things.  The car is by far the easiest vehicle mode to control.  The boat and plane take a bit of getting used to, but none are terribly frustrating after a bit of practice.  There are also plenty of characters with different stats, so you'll certainly be able to find something that suits your play style.  (In fact, there's more than enough characters, many of which you will likely never use.)I enjoyed playing my way through the campaign.  The difficulty curve increased at about the same rate as my skill, so the levels got harder as I got better.  There were a handful of tracks I had to play several times, but for the most part I was able to complete each level in 4 tries or less.Multiplayer is where this game really shines, assuming you have friends to play with.  The game supports 4 player local play and up to 10 players online, which can be a mix of local and network.  The silliness and chaos of casual races with friends is great, but there is also a small competitive community if you're into that instead.One point of complaint is that the game artificially increases the game time by trapping you in non-skippable menus after each race.  It takes 35 seconds to restart a level after you fail, 55 if you want to change characters or difficulty.  You will certainly be button mashing that :XBA: button to get through these screens as fast as possible, but this still amounts to over an hour of your life wasted in menus if you play through the campaign.Another point of complaint is that the ability to fully customize races is missing.  I'd like the ability to specify which weapons are available, or change the rules of the race.  Maybe put on low gravity, faster cars, or some other crazy mix of custom rules.My Game Completion info:I beat all World Tour levels on Hard difficulty.  This unlocked a 6th cup and Expert mode.  I then beat all the levels in the 6th cup on Hard except the last level (which requires you to beat the entire game on Expert in order to unlock. No thanks!  I've had enough of this game artificially increasing game time.)I also beat the first 5 Grand Prix cups on Hard difficulty.  This unlocks another 5 Grand Prix cups in mirror mode (which I ignored).

												Review, Tips, GuideWhere do I start with how awesome and addictive this game is? Somehow I managed to clock in over 620 hours playing this, still crave every second of it!Being a late starter and only getting the game at the start of 2014 when a friend was kind enough to give it to me as a gift while trying to promote Ryo Hazuki DLC and Shenmue.I did not have high expectations for the game after playing the horrible touch screen version you can download on mobile... this dampened my expectations as to what to expect on the PC and console addition of SSASRT.First mode I tried was the online match-making. Never in my life have I felt like such a novice at a kart racing game, there really is a polarising effect between being good and being down right elitist when it comes to online MM. This did not stop me from playing. I was fascinated, intrigued of how these top players became so awesome at this kart racer and quickly learnt that SSASRT is a rather technical Kart racing game.Those new to the SSASRT: you need to learn fundamental basics.Learn how to drift to level 3Find out how to risk boost and danger boostLearn the tracks as best as you canLearn how to stack your boostsLearn every item and use them effectivelyLearn how to avoid drones with a driftUnlock practice with all characters find their strengths and weaknessesCheck your mini-map on straight ways for approaching racers and on incoming item spam, back spam if needed to counter this and look backward to see the potential racer.Constantly if ever in bad situation go all-star strategy.Above all else do not hit walls and practice and maintain high speed and keep consistent racesWondering how I got so good at this game: I came up with a plan!Decided to complete career mode and gain all (232 stars) and complete all Grand Prix and mirror tracks set out to unlock all characters and their respective console mods. I thought this would give me the edge I needed but I was in for a surprise... Gaining all the all-stars in career mod was tougher than expected but at the same time it was the most rewarding. And whatever you gained in career mode without knowing ...you will be applying in online MM.Sumo Digital have gone to a lot of effort at getting the balance between casually playing this Kart Racer and challenging the player to get better while also gaining rewards after completing and getting all 232 stars. And gaining a new character ""Ages"" was funny enough (this spells Sega backwards).I was feeling confident with my new attained super kart racing skills after completing the game, getting all 232 stars and completing Grand Prix on expert mode; I was sure I was in with a chance to take on even the top players on MM, come out on top or at least give them a good run for their money. I found myself accelerating up the ranks and obtaining & keeping a constant and respectful 1600 rank in MM. I new it was time to take on higher ranked players and test my skills.. Again I was in for surprise, feeling frustrated with my efforts and felt I had peaked only obtaining 1600 to 1700 ranks while I greatly desired to achieve a 2000 rank.To do this I had to better my playing style to compete with higher ranks. I pushed on and came up with another plan, which was only something you could gain through experience and patience and allot of hours playing. I set out to learn all the yellow pick-up locations, what they had to offer and tap into their potential and also learned which mods and characters worked best for each track.On some tracks this was a huge game changer: for example there are two yellow pick-ups on Graffiti City: the first pick-up is a triple boost; used at the right time you can gain tremendous speed on straight runs, however this is not always enough to win this track consistently due to the tight nature of the course and the ""bees"" on the second lap. Now, this is where the second yellow pick-up comes in handy, which is a (blue glove). I like to use this when the ""Bees"" come my/your way... activate it and sail through them, the bees also act like a wall and are slowing down other racers who might be fast approaching.This strategy gave me huge advantage over players, and from time to time I have been accused of cheating on Grafity City. Well, once you get to grips with the course it's possible to pick both yellow pick-ups and use the triple boost and pick-up the blue glove which will both give your even more distance, when timed and use correctly. Sometimes you might find yourself in challenging situations with regular players who see you as their rival, and you might end up getting a few friend requests.:)) This is something not many articles mention or people talk about...It  is the online social communtiy linked with that game which I think people really need to start taking notes of because I think this is also a factor that makes this game a great success...it is the community that goes with it..SSASRT has an active racing community and friendly too, and sometimes it causes and creates rivalries in MM, especially with the Brazil players and Europeans.One veteran SSASRT racer who goes by the alias of ""harlot"" decided to add me as a friend back in july, he was quick to message me about my skills limitations at that time and style... others have taken note of my potential and this gave me more confidence to keep on going and to continue racing SSASRT. I can't remember exactly what was said back then, but we soon became good rivals to one another, we both had a common goal to improve our racing style and to win as much as we can. But we had different ways of going about it. harlot said to me: If I want to really improve my game I need to ""time attack"", I took note of what he said and I managed to unlock all the secrets the tracks had to offer, if it wasn't for harlot's insight. It would be almost impossible for me to keep up with the elitist at MM....there is so much to learn to be at the top of your game while playing SSASRT...The game has unlimited potential in that regard!HARLOT QUOTE: I can, at this moment, be a better matchmaker in a week, than you can be a time attacker in the same amount of timeEven though I had the Time Attack experience it did not always solve crucial problems and differences between MM and TA, that is because in MM you can pick up items and if you get hit it it slows you down… because TA promotes the use of ""Console Mods"", but at times this is not always suitable for MM and so, I decided to approach this differently.This is what I come up with to address this issue:I have a character for every track in the game, I developed a strategy that will give me the overall edge to that particular track and the best balance depending on some factors, that I take into account.I am very specific about this, learned over time certain methods and race conditions that need a particular fine tuning, which can greatly improve your chances. This is where the true sophistication that SSASRT brings.These are a few examples what character's I use for some of the tracks in SSASRT and the mod's I use and the yellow items I like to pick-up.Race of Ages - Ryo Hazuki - Console mod - Provides the perfect balance of movement speed - especially in water areas and being small enough to avoid going over the edge of the track.Game changer: Triple Boost yellow pick-up second lap just passed the finish line. Chilly Castle - AIAI - Sonic - Manager - (Ryo Hazuki/ Console mod) - best over all mod for this track ""Acceleration"".Game Changer: You will need to know this course inside and out, learn TA acceleration mod and track knowledge and above all maintaining lead will see you beat this track on MM.Dream valley - Ages / Ryo Hazuki / Gilleus / - Console modGame Changer: Learn how to (Risk-boost) on practically anything and stack your boosts as best you can.

												This is the best Mario Kart clone currently on the market, but it does have some positive points over even Mario Kart...- The tracks are so varied, with some really good tracks included.- Content, the game has so many characters to unlock, kart mods, tracks, & a long campaign that get's pretty tricky near the end.- The campaign is 2 player.- The AI doesn't cheat, if you're spanking them, you're spanking them. They don't magically get the equivilant to 3 blue shells in a row & take you out on the last 2 corners, despite dominating the entire race.- The difficulty is fair & has a nice upward slope, meaning you get better at the game as it gets harder, nothing ever seems too hard, unless you jump straight in for the 3 star missions despite never playing before.- The music and graphics may not stand out as much as Mario Kart, but they do stand on their own merits.It's not all positive though, the game does have some bad points;- Character selection, quite a few are pretty bland & won't be used unless you're aiming for 100%. I mean I love the Football Manager series, but I have no interest in driving as some generic manager just because SEGA publish the franchise.- Shadow's in it.- Some of the 3 star missions will do your head in, but again, this isn't the game being unfair, it just means you're not driving well enough.- A few of the tracks are forgetable.8/10Best kart racer on Steam, if you need a Mario Kart-esque racer in your library, this is by far the best choice.

I really hope that SEGA gets a developer or the same developers to make a third game. Hey SEGA, remember you said that you want the comsumers trust back, well get on track to making a third sonic racing game like this, that will help a little.			"

												This is my favorite racing game on Steam. Its similar to new versions of Mario Kart, but I like the feel of this better. It has the typical things like character selection, map selection, power ups, and turbo speed strips to drive over. It includes land, water, and air racing. Some of the maps have all three in one race. The acheivements are fun to get, and some are actually pretty challenging. I like the feel of this one much more than the first. I definitely recommend using a controller for this game, as it makes it much easier. It has online play too, so its fun to race friends. Drifting is a very important thing in this game, so if you're losing a lot, try to drift more around turns. I recommend this to to anyone whos looking for a racing game, a casual game to just play a little bit of once in a while,  something to play with friends, or a fan of Mario Kart or CTR Crash Team Racing.

												This game is quite impressive and original.Other than Mario Kart, it's been more than 15 years that I haven't seen such game being fun and competitive at the same time.The graphics are good, the different maps will give you some nostalgic feelings, every transformation is smooth to drive with.The online multiplayer is a little laggy and in some maps, there isn't really a technique of driving you can use to win, it all depends of the items and that's quite bad. However, the local multiplayer up to 4 players is really fun, no lag and team with your friends to be on the podium.Also, the game itself is quite easy, there's 4 different levels (Easy to Expert) and you can end them without any problem. The ghost times will maybe give you some challenge, unless you unlocked the last car and fully upgraded it.- Finally, it's an awesome game, really enjoyable in solo. Buy it now!			"

												Rating 9.5/10Overview: Arcade kart RacerThe Good:+ 20 levels that span across different parts of the Sega universe. All the levels are detailed, well designed and incredibly fun to play. What really makes the levels is that they feel so alive, whether its air ships battling in the skies, pieces of the track blowing up, carriers jets flying over head, or flying through exotic envirnoments it all adds to the atmoshpere. + The majority of the levels change inbetween laps keeping things unique and interesting. There are three modes of racing: car, boat and plane.  One lap you may be driving a car and the next lap you may be flying a plane, sometimes you switch between the modes in a single lap. +Plenty of characters each with their own stats. As you play with a certain racer you unlock mods that change their stats for better performance depending on the level/mode your playing. + The game features plenty of different modes across 4 difficulty levels. Each mode is fun to play and very creative. Some modes include racing, boost challenges, sprint, battle areans, traffic attack etc. The Average- I found the weapons you use to be somewhat average. I did not find them as unique or interesting as the levels. - Multiplayer is somewhat still alive but its pretty hard to get a good game going. ConclusionThis is one of the best arcade racers on Steam, if you can get some friends together you are sure to have a good time. They took everything that was great in the first game and improved upon it in significant way "

												Why would I not recommend this game?The gameplay is vastly different from the previous entry in the series. Transforming and drift boosting will give a great edge in this game once you master the latter. Risk boosting in plane mode can take some time to master since you have to roll out of the way at the last moment for it to count.The staff ghosts can be a real pain in some levels (looking at Graveyard Gig and Burning Rangers in particular since both are a little difficult to master drifting in).Cameo appearances from non-SEGA stuff (Danica Patrick, Ralph, and Yogscast if you choose to buy it) are nice to see. Interestingly, people seem to hold a lot of course record top 10 spots with Ralph with characters like Metal Sonic, Sonic, and AGES all coming pretty close to it.Quite a blast to race through the courses (although I think Mirror Mode could have been replaced with 4-8 new tracks instead, oh well, SUMO's call there) and try to beat your own record every time. I did find Traffic Attack (sans the last one) and Pursuit to be a difficult to master since those felt a tad bit more on the ""need to memorize a specific course of pattern"" kind of logic to me. Pursuit was way more difficult though since you have a set amount of HP so you can't just recklessly chase down the tank.The characters were great although a couple of them looked a bit off (looking at Gum, Beat, and Pudding). Dialogue and racing stuff was pretty nice. It seems Gillius is the hardest one to master as well out of all the characters.Fantastic game, whether it is in a deal on Steam or not, worth icking up and playing.			"

			Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a kart racing video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. It was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in November 2012, for...		

Long time ago, Nintendo create their best Kart Race called Mario Kart. Althought the game shows aged the gameplay still now a days totally fantastic, and using that ""secret"" formula, Nintendo created more and more games of their sucessful franchise.But if you LOVE Mario Kart, like me, and don't have a Nintendo plataform, well, you certainlly was abandoned. Well, less so far, Sega copied that ""secret formula"" and I could said: Improved that formula... a lot!Think about a game made with respect,""love"" and care... Yes! Sega did it! And put all your legacy inside this game (almost all) like Sonic series, Golden axe, Samba de Amigo, Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, Afterburn, Skies of Arcadia, Crazy Taxi and much more... Pure nostalgic! The ""transformed mechanics"" add more variety. (Your machine tranformes to an Airplane, or a ship depending of the situation)Highlights:- Perfect Gameplay- feeling of speed- Itens are balanced and help you (and cause trouble too!) your controller skill are more important.- Diversty of game modes, tracks, chracters.- Graphically Awesome (and you don't need a powerful PC!)- Nostalgic music and places- 4 splitscreen gameplay and online modes.Really, this game have only Highlights. Play it and have fun!			"

												This game is very similar to Crash Team Racing and Muppet RaceMania from PlayStation (I only played those two). Concept is same - you race with other characters, using powerups to help you on the way. There's no pure racing, you have to learn to drift properly and do stunts while in air to earn short speed boosts and also trying to sabotage other players, which is not always easy to do but can help greatly in determining the winner. There're plenty of tracks and several racing mods so it's hard to get boring.Although you can finish this game in any difficulty you want, playing on highest difficulty is a real treat. There's pure adrenaline rush, trying to finish first without making errors (especially in ""beat the ghost"" mod). Multiplayer is still active (as of this date), you won't have problems finding others to play with. Some achievements are really hard to get so this is not easy 100%.Overall, great racing experience, great game, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the Mario Kart version for the PC. Or better yet, the old Diddy Kong Racing.Run in a different environments and with different vehicles (car, plane and boat) is very fun and every course and characters brings that old and good feeling to revive the golden hits of the Sega company. It's just to much fun to bring Alex Kidd in the Golden Axe course and the Get Set Radio challenging you for the first place.The race controls are pretty good, it's very similar to other games with this kart style, but in here you must learn how to drift to keep it up to the competition and earn some boost to make your way to the first place or to beat the time.The game modes are very nice, you can play only some races, go for tournaments or go on career mode to earn starts and then unlock more courses and characters.The power ups works the same way we are used to know in this style of game, and they add a good fun element. Some of them you can choose to throw ahead or leave to hit someone behind you.The sound design is great. Every music and sound effect make all the experience in the race unique and brings the memories of those games.The level design is awesome! It gives you the feel of movement and speed that is the heart of a race game and it is always changing! In some courses you will see all the landscape and the road being attacked and as the race goes you will change to other paths or even change completely your vehicle to a plane or boat to continue the race. And this is absolutely fantastic!If you are an orphan of Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing (which is better, sorry to say that...) you MUST try this one. It's a great and extremely fun race game.			"

												I've seen this game for some time now and didn't really think much of it.  Finally, at it's super-low sale price I decided to give it a go.  I was a HUGE fan of ""Mario Kart"" - both for the Super Nintendo and for N64.  So this game had a little bit to live up to...HOLY ♥♥♥♥ WAS I SURPISED.This game doesn't have anything to do with Sonic (aside from including him and the cast as characters...among cooler characters), it's just a balls-to-the-wall  come-get-some cart racer.  I don't think I've ever played a cart racer that felt so damned... HARDCORE.  The characters are all varyed but fairly balanced, the maps get absolutely insane, ranging from peaceful mario-kartish maps to nightmares from hell and beyond worst than anything the Rainbow Road could dream up.  And you get to enjoy all of these things not just from a Driver's Seat, but from a Cockpit and from a Captain's chair as well!The game is hard.  Even playing alone in world tour mode on ""Easy"" presents some challenge.  And it'll take you a good bit of practice to beat those same races on ""Normal"".  Step into multiplayer?  You better be prepared for a stomping, because those kids don't mess around.I give this game a solid 8/10.  It would be a 10/10, but the marketing department loses 2 points for not letting me know I should have been playing this sooner.BUY THIS GAME NOW.  Is it full price?  Then buy it.  Is it on sale?  Then buy a few extra copies for some friends of yours.  You won't regret it. "

Sonic & All-Stars Racing TransformedDeveloped by: Sumo DigitalPublished by: SEGAReleased: Nov 2012 (Consoles), Jan 2013 (Steam), Jan 2014 (IOS & Android), Oct 2016 (Backwards compat. for Xbox One)In short:Without a contest the finest Kart racing game released on PC.  Excellent port from the console versions, runs great, plays great with both keys or a controller.  Large selection of tracks themed around classic Sega games, full of alternate routes and 'interactive' track changes, all featuring sections where your vehicles transform into either flying machines or speed boats.  Plenty of single player content, very challenging on higher difficulties, but of course where the game shines is in multiplayer.  Supports local co-op up to four players, and also lets you play local co-op in online multiplayer.  Excellent net code, I've never noticed typical lag in friend or public lobbies.If you plan to go it alone be warned though, while there is an online playerbase still for the game it is pretty small.  Still , well worth having in your Steam library for those rare cases of couch co-op opportunities, or if you can round up some online friends for races.			"

It's also probably the closest thing we'll ever get to having Mario Kart on Steam.Okay, so let's get it out of the way first because it's been said to death, and it's true: this game is basically a Mario Kart clone. It's very easy to see how the older game was translated into this. Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed doesn't score high marks on originality. For instance, a lot of the pickups are basically just reskinned versions of the ones we know and love. Instead of green shells, there are snowballs. Instead of the red shell, there is an RC car. Instead of the mushroom, there are boosts. Instead of the mine, there's is a blowfish. Instead of the golden mushroom, there's the hot rod. Instead of the invincibility star, there's the ""All Star"" pickup. The racing gameplay is also based entirely around drifting. On top of that, there is the battle mode akin to the Mario Kart style. As said before, this game doesn't do much in the way of uniqueness, but it's the way everything coheres that makes it stand out.Okay, so let's talk about how this game isn't like Mario Kart. There are three important gameplay factors here: the first is that the game is based on three different kinds of vehicle types: car, boat, and plane. This creates quite a bit of variety in the playstyle and level layout, which tends to change from lap to lap. The other thing is that while yes, drifting between yellow, red, and blue sparks was a thing in Mario Kart, here the boosting is much more prevalent (a third-tier boost gives you much more boost than it would in Kart) and the pre-boost drifting seems to lower your speed more than in Kart, making it slightly more of a risk. The third aspect is that you now gain experience points for each character, unlocking different ""mods"" that alter various stats for the players. You start out with 16 or 18 already unlocked, and you can unlock another 10 or 12. Each character only uses his or her own cart but can unlock five or six mods, granting you about 180 different loadouts, possibly more.There are a few other things that this does differently than does Kart. For instance, the ground will frequently give you opportunities to do stunts, the correct implementation of which will give you boosts, which are essential to winning on the higher difficulties. There are also unique pickups: there's the rocket, which fires straight ahead and is essentially like a very hard green shell to aim. There's the glove, which lets you pick up any item thrown at you and lets you take it for yourself. There's the twister, which can spin an enemy around. And there's also the notorious SWARM OF BEES, which is the most random of the bunch, putting bees in the field. Mario Kart fans may be pleased or displeased to hear that there is no real equivalent of the blue shell in this game.Before talking about multiplayer, I do want to mention the single-player. Single-player is way more fun than it deserves to be. The career mode has multiple parts, including world tour and grand prix. World Tour seems like the main single-player ""campaign,"" and is intuitive, easy to understand, and has a lot of cool game modes, some of which unfortunately didn't make it into the multiplayer. Game modes such as Traffic Attack, where you have to avoid cars and go through certain zones to get time added to the clock, and Pursuit, where you collect ammo pickups to destroy a tank that's firing at you, are just great fun and add a new element that had been lacking in Kart since the beginning.Now, on to the multiplayer. The multiplayer is very fun. You can choose between five different kinds of racing styles: standard racing on four different difficulties, battle race (where each player has three lives and you try to kill the other players during a race), arena battle, capture the chao (which I admittedly hate), and boost race (which I admittedly love). It is unfortunately a bit clunky and time-consuming to get everything set up, as I will explain below. Thankfully they've mitigated some of the loading time with giving you a slot machine mini-game while the map is loading, which require five coins that you can only pick up on racing courses, which may yield a bonus. You can use any of the characters that you've unlocked plus any of their mods. You will also still receive EXP as usual. I should also mention that you can split-screen the game at any time. I've never tried this, but the game encourages this at every turn, so I guess if you're a split-screen fan, this is a game to consider. I should also comment on the look and feel of the maps. The maps are extremely well-detailed, bright, colorful, smooth, and pretty. The bright maps feel very nice and the dark maps don't feel drab or dreary, as appears to be the current trend that blights modern video games. The maps themselves are inspired by various SEGA games, like Super Monkey Ball or Space Channel 5, but none include actual map layouts from said games. The feel of the cars is pretty solid. The characters are sometimes a bit random but come from a variety of different classic games. For instance, there's a character named Pudding; do you know where a SEGA character named Pudding comes from? As you can imagine, there are more Sonic characters than any others, but you're never required to play as a Sonic character. Of course, I wish there would be more characters from random games (like Billy Hatcher, for instance, how cool would that be?), and this is one of those games that lets your imagination run wild with ideas. Of course, there are a few negatives. Probably the biggest is the first-time setup is a bit of a hassle. It sucks that you need to launch the game separately in Config mode and I've also heard that some people can only get it to open in compatibility mode. On top of that, it seems that they never fixed the sound. You need to turn the volume way down if you want to talk to people, but at the main title, the sound will revert back to its normal volume, which is all the way up. The game does hardly anything to explain to you how to use any of the controls, including drifting and what the items do. I get that this encourages trial and error but there are entire main facets that are crucial to winning that are unexplained by the game. Lastly, setting up matches in the multiplayer is a real pain. You have to re-select your character each time you want to do a new race, and if you're the host, changing the map takes you through a lot of unnecessary menus. It should have been a lot quicker. I should also mention that while you can play this with a mouse and keyboard, I find that the controls are entirely unfeasible. The only way I can play this is with a controller, perhaps that's just me.All in all, this is a comparable game to the classic Mario Kart (I guess it would compare to 8, but it's much, MUCH better than 8 in my opinion). It feels like a game that was made by a company that actually cares, not SEGA. Highly recommended.			"

												Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is exactly what it says on the box. Racing transformed for a modern era, while still having that classic feel making this a must own.For those of you feeling like Mario Kart has gotten a bit stale due to lack of innovation, this game may be more your style. This game is just teeming with love, with classic games bursting with modern visuals and sounds. Every part of this game just feels like a love letter to SEGA fans.GraphicsModernized graphics for classic SEGA games such as Burning Rangers and Panzer Dragoon. The visuals in this game are stunning when you play on the highest settings, and even with a modest computer you'll still get 60+FPS making this game feel amazingly fast and fluid. All the characters are well modeled and textured, and the levels are teeming with beautiful colors and lighting. Each level has been lovingly crafted from older SEGA titles and re-imagined in ways that will bring a tear to long-time fans.SoundThe music in the game mostly consists of remixed themes from older games in a mostly drum'n bass genre, with the odd dubstep-ish song thrown in here and there. But don't let that fool you, the dubstep is done in moderation and actually sounds good, even to someone who doesn't really like that genre. Each song feels fast-paced and full of action to make the gameplay that much more satisfying.GameplayNow on the the most important part, gameplay. As you may have guessed, there are 3 modes of driving, air, water, and land. Land plays exactly as you think it would, very much like Mario kart, but a bit faster and the cars feel heavier. Boating/water travel feels like slippery land travel, and is the hardest to steer on because of it. This is mostly noted in the Burning Rangers level, which is mostly boating with sharp turns in which you tend to go bumping a lot. Air travel is, well, air travel. You can still drift in the air, but you have to worry about your X axis as well, which tends to make it more difficult. You can also do stunts in the air as any vehicle, which will give you a boost if done correctly. Of course if you crash mid-stunt you're gonna go slower.The items/weapons in the game are well thought out and even if you get smashed by every single weapon, if you're a good enough player you can still get first place. No blue shells here. Although you may want to watch out for the bees.Value for the costAt $30 you will get way more than your money's worth. Tons of missions and unlockables, GPs to go through, stickers to unlock for doing certain things and of course, multiplayer. The multiplayer is really what will keep bringing you back to this. Online works well for the most part, and racing with up to 10 random people or friends is an absolute delight. Voice chat is included as well, and at the time of writing this there is no way to currently turn that off, but there is a patch on the way which will fix it.Final verdictA game well worth the money that will keep you entertained for many a month. If you've ever been a fan of racing or kart racing in general you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to not give this a try.9.5/10			"

												So after the pretty decent but somewhat shallow outing of Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing, Sumo Digital sure caught me off-guard when they announced a sequel to it. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed does a good job at improving the flaws and shortcomings the first game had, such as making the courses more varied with at least 1 track based off a different franchise such as Jet Set Radio, Golden Axe, NiGHTS, Shinobi, etc. as opposed to just running with 3 or 4 themes for each course, more interesting track design with tougher placements hazards and they even brought in remixes of various SEGA franchise tunes to accomodate the soundtrack.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed's main gimmick is having the vehicles and gameplay change constantly during the race, transforming your car  when you pass through large blue rings to either a boat or a plane. Some courses have a interesting mechanic in where usually the 2nd or 3rd lap has you driving through a completely different pathway, forcing you to adapt to these situations and work your way around these. Most racing game veterans will recognize this vehicle-changing gimmick from Mario Kart 7, but it reminds me more of the likes of Diddy Kong Racing from back on the N64, except that the courses are designed specifically for each vehicle mode rather than a wide-open track fitting them all. Also very important is that while you're in the air, flipping and rolling your vehicle is encouraged to build up boosts for when you land, but you have to be careful with this as not landing properly will costs you speed and lose all boost buildup, and there's switch-drifting which helps you maintain your drift boost buildup as you switch from steering left to right and vice-versa.Other new features are the mods that come with each character. Mods are pre-set custom stat adjustments that you can pick from on the character select screen to help you adjust to certain conditions better in the races and in missions in World Tour. (Explained later down below). If you get hit alot or crash into obstacles, acceleration suits your vehicle best and if it has alot of sharp turns, go for handling. Items are more or less kept the same, but given a new skin, such as the boxing glove to the missile, the barrier shield from Sonic to a glove which in addition to blocking either a stage hazard or a enemy projectile now gives you that item to use in return to get revenge on the attacker, if your item slot isn't filled with another item. Most items are balanced enough, but I will list my issues with them when I get to them.World Tour is also a new addition to this game specifically designed to cater to the more mission-based gameplay in where you need to clear races under certain rules or different gameplay methods, such as flying through rings in plane mode, winning consequtively from a set amount of opponents in the same race in a 1-on-1 format. The difficulty you clear these missions on affect the stars you get, which in turn are required to progress further in the World Tour's map and the real reward from doing them: unlocking new characters and special mods. Most of these missions are designed pretty decently, but your skill will be sorely tested on quite a few on them, especially in the unlockable Expert class difficulty.As for my issues with this game:- A few items are very unbalanced and usually can most likely make or break a race for skilled players. A good example of this is the ice weapon. You gain 3 shots of these by default, and while the game tells you that shooting all 3 shots at 1 opponent will freeze and stun them longer than normal, I notice no such difference, and every seperate shot stuns you as much as getting shot by all 3. The game developers tried to implement a way to make it hard for expert players to win races by a miles' lead compared to the other racers with the Sky Tiger item, a item that spawns giant wasps in front of the 1st place lead, but won't hurt the user if he passes by them while they're still active. It sounds fine on paper, but in terms of programming, it leaves alot to be desired. It works only fine on small passageways on car and boat plathways because it almost garantuees the 1st place lead can barely avoid them, but they can't spawn properly if used near a transform ring, and in the plane they are very easy to avoid due the large area's in the plane sections. It's also possible to shoot a wasp and clear yourself a way through them, which I think shouldn't be possible. It can be a decent counter to expert players, but this isn't comparable to the Blue Shell from Mario Kart by a longshot.- The method of unlocking characters in this game is very arbitrary compared to the previous game. If you want to play as your favorite character from the get-go and isn't available right at the start, you're going to spend a incredibly long time mastering the game's courses and mechanics just to be able to unlock them. For expert players this isn't a big deal, but casual players who don't have alot of free time on their hands will be annoyed by this, if they want to play as for example NiGHTS or Joe Musashi, it will take quite some time for them to even unlock them, when in the previous game you could just play a few races, earn points to spend in the shop to unlock them, and there you go.- The physics in a few courses, especially the boat sections in the game are very clunky and will cause the many frustrated losses of players. A good example of this are the boost ramps in the boat sections of Samba Tour and Adder's Lair in where if you approach the ramp from the side and not dead-on straight, your boat will tilt to ridiculous extremes and will lose all momentum and speed trying to readjust itself, or you will be launched way higher in the air than you're supposed to, and lose a good deal of speed as well. And there are also some courses in where some object events that occur in laps will actually hinder the player very drastically if they're not careful and going too fast, such as a robotic fish in the final lap of Ocean View causing the player to bump all over the place if they come in contact with it, spawning when the 1st lead reaches a specific area, and the bridge in Adder's Lair at the end of the 1st lap will not raise fast enough and cause the player to most likely crash into it and lose all speed. These are major issues and I don't understand why the developers couldn't iron out those bugs. -Unlocking the Expert class difficulty in World Tour is very late near the end of the mode itself, and forces you to replay every single mission you cleared before on the Hard difficulty all over again if you want all the stars in the game, which is a really cheap method of artifically extending the mode's gameplay length. Issues aside, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a solid racing game, and I do recommend it for both racing game enthusiasts and fans of SEGA's franchises in general, but beware of the steep learning curve and having to deal with occasional frustrating glitches or lag in the online gameplay.

												had a so much fun playing this game and its better the mario kart in my opinion -first of all the plot, well there is no real plot (sadly) , you just have to select a character ( around 20 + 3 from the dlcs and you can lvl up to get new mods to balance your kart stats and play with you own style) then select  a game modes (there is World Tour, Grand Prix , quick races , arena for multi ).-graphicly it's really beautiful and well detailed for a consol port (on ultra) also well optimized even for a potato pc.-gameplay: easy game mechanics ( arcade racing) with power pickups , each character (from different sega games + bonus characters like TF2 ) has his own different kart with different stats , the levels are inspired for different sega games  but the game is very unbalanced when it comes to difficulty ( easy is too damn easy , medium is like hard , hard is like dark souls hard and very hard is near impossible )-perfect  voice acting ,awesome soundtracks ( remixes of sega games main music)-for the controls ( the bad thing in this games) you need an xbox 360 controllers or use x360ce cause the keyboard is a no go -multiplayer is still live , you will find some people playing quick races.-time to time the game crashes but only when you exit the game so its ok i guess no big deal-achievements works fine but some of them are very challenging  -steam trading cardswell if you're looking for some fun between friends or solo then this game is for you ( no mario kart on pc so its not like you have any choice :p ) better get this one and skip the firt sonic all stars game , worth the money ( better get it on sales  4.99 $)9/10			"

												Probably the best kart racer not called ""Mario Kart"". Depending on what day you ask me, I might even say its better than Mario Kart. Sumo Digital really ""gets"" Sega fanservice in a way that even Sega themselves do not. This game is, flat out, a love letter to Sega fans. All of the obvious references are hit, but expect to see plenty of Sega obscura get shoutouts. The artificial intelligence is really smart, too; don't expect Mario Kart's passive A.I., the CPU racers in this game want blood and will go out of their way to deny you important pickups. But, as long as you keep out of their line of sight and drift accordingly, things won't go too poorly. Legitimate driving skills will take you far in this game.The tracks are creative and varied, the game controls well, and the visuals are gorgeous. Like Mario Kart but don't own any Nintendo platforms? This is for you.			"

												Bias: I am a dino. Gotta go Fast!One of my favorite racing games (besides Mario Kart). I am not the best at racing, however, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and even held a few tournaments for some friends in different groups I am in. It took some time, but I was able to unlock all the racers and tracks to allow for variability. I am still not the best at slides but I have fun competing anyway.If you enjoy cartoony / mario kart esque racing games, this is a game for you.To be honest, I have no complaints. Maybe hope for more characters or tracks for this great title, but that was the only thing10/10 on a Dino Scale. I must play game if you have friends who you like to compete with.			"

												Sega, you nail'd it...This title could looks like a copy/paste of a classic mario kart racing, BUT IT ISN'T!We all know that the Sonic team likes to do so much meth, but this time they really work hard on this title. Every map is well designed, every character haves his styled veicle and every music fit his game's map. The poring of this game into the PC is not one of the best, but after some minutes of game, you will learn how to drive those frikin' veicle with no problems at all.The original thing that really impress me is the fact that the maps change every lap, they're not static, but interact with everything that is goin on in the background.But there are some problems, and some of those are ridiculous.Some model's eyes... they are staring at me.. REALLY THEY'RE ♥♥♥♥ING SCARY. Did they forget to give them some eyelids?! And the most stupid thing I've ever seen: Sega actually paid some companies for add their characters, and they decide to voice acting them selfing, giving us stuff like a tf2 Pyro who mumbles like he's (she's?) suffering the pains of hell (you see what I did here? No? k.)Last thing that kinda bothered me, was the decision to create extra maps that are actually maps already in-game, but mirrored. They really had to?In the end, this is a great title that I suggest you to get if on a nice sale, you can follow me, I'll set you free, if you trust me I'll make you escape from the track (I have no idea how to end this review).Final score: 7.5/10			"

												For a game that features racing across land, sea, and air, with a drift mechanic for all three, it's astonishing how accessible this title is. About the only downside I can think of is the amount of grinding required: you'll need to complete courses on harder difficulties to unlock the full character and course roster....oh, and despite being a fantastically-optimised PC port, the graphics options can only be changed outside of the game. Looking past this pet peeve, though, I'd definitely recommend this game.			"

												Amazing racing game, it features racing on land, water, and air with transforming vehicles. It has over 20 playable characters and over 25 arenas and dynamic tracks playable in a lot of engaging game modes.I really like how they were able to set up the World tour. It has 4 difficulty settings and if you pay attention and observe how the opponents race, you can learn a lot even from easy ones. Aside from the standard race, there are a lot of events such as drift challenge, traffic attack, ring race, sprint, pursuit, battle race, and versus. Each of the events focuses on a game element to help players practice on a specific game mechanic.What is more interesting is that the local game can be played by up to four players (split-screen). If you can have some friends or relatives come over you can play race, battle arena, battle race, capture the chow, or boost race game mode. (Even the world tour can be played by up to four players.)As of writing, I have just started playing events under the Superstar Showdown, I have not yet tried to play online, I'll try finishing everything on hard level before doing so. Overall, I think this is the best kart racing game.			"

												Summary: Mario Kart in land, sea, and airMultiplayer: YesCompletion: 4-6 hrsCards: YesCloud: YesSonic Racing Transformed is pretty much the closest experience you'll get to Mario Kart on Steam. Since this is a fairly large genre as of late, Sega needed to come up with some sort of gimmick to make the game stand out. This game's gimmick is the ability for your vehicle to transform to handle water and air. I guess it works. It certainly keeps the laps interesting instead of going around in the same circles each time. The one annoyance is that controls of the vehicle change when it transforms. It's an added learning curve, but once you get the hang of it it can be enjoyable.The race tracks in Sonic Racing Transformed are inspired by various games from Sega franchises. I rather enjoyed the track design. I found them pleasing to look at and fun to play around in. The music remixes are also fun to listen to. In particular I enjoy the Afterburner stage and music. That one is a blast.There's several types of races you can run, but I would have liked a few more race modes. How about some kind of separate mode where you can buy upgrades for your cart with prize money you earn? Or maybe a demolition derby where you try to ram people off a track. How about an aerial dogfight battle arena?The weapons are a tad on the weak side. Very few really feel like game-changers, and the homing ability is spotty at best. They just lack the oomph that all Mario Kart weapons possess. I suppose this means that more skill is required in actual driving instead of facerolling with overpowered weapons, but I wouldn't mind a separate mode with said overpowered weapons.For the advanced racers, there's additional techniques to learn in the way of boosts, which I haven't nearly mastered yet. Mastery of this is integral to high level play.I'm baffled that there's no obvious way to change tracks in multiplayer. It's sort of hidden in the corner where you must select Options, and as far as I know, there's no random option. To the best of my knowledge, there's no grand prix  or world tour mode in multiplayer either. So far I haven't experienced much lag, if any, when playing with friends online, so that gets a good mark from me.I know it's not fair to keep comparing it to Mario Kart, but that's because it's hard not to when the game clearly takes inspiration from it. Sonic Racing Transformed might not be the best of the genre, but for Steam, it may very well be the best Kart game. I rate this game a 8.5/10.  It's a plenty good racer if you and your friends only have Steam and just want to kart race.			"

												Sega really did it with this game. Forget about the previous Mario Kart clone, this amazing racing game has it own personality and many things to add to the sub-genre. The graphics are amazing, the courses very well designed and full of details, and in a good computer the game will look impressive. The 3 types of vehicles are very different and give a lot of variety to the game. A lot of characters from many Sega franchises can be used, and even exclusive like a TF2 team.			"

												I got this in a sale and have been blown away by it. Excellently fun racer, fantastic local multiplayer. Controlwise, a pad is fantadtic, but it plays just as well using the keyboard. The difficulty is just right also - as a new player, I'm struggling on medium difficulty.  Hasn't stopped me desiring to replay races though!Graphically beautiful,  soundtrack is great, so many nods to Sega's history.The roster might seem a little random, but even racing with characters like Football Manager can be pretty entertaining. Best of all - no blue shells! Totally recommended.			"

												The best kart-racing game out there.  A must, worth full price easily. split screen and online play, grab some controllers and get at it with your friends! alone? play online with randoms! Or alone and unlock all the driving profiles for all the characters!Best of all: if a friend is hosting the dlc map/s? You can play too.			"

												Sonic and All Stars Racing: Transformed, (or as I like to call it, SEGA All Stars Racing: Transformed) is a racing game featuring all of your favorite SEGA Characters race to the finish, as well as some random 3rd Party Characters. It features race tracks based off of worlds from Sonic games and most of SEGA's forgotten franchises and the racers vehicles transform from cars, to boats, to planes. So it's like Mario Kart 7, Diddy Kong Racing, that random Disney racing game and that Hot Wheels game that share the same idea of transforming race cars. I've never used a controller for the PC Version and I stuck to just using the keyboard, the nice thing about this is that you can adjust the controls for the keyboard to see which keys suit you more comfortably, and not just pressing random buttons all over the keyboard. The car and boat forms are cool, the boat forms are more fun as you can easily perform more tricks to get boosts. The plane form takes some time to getting used to when it comes to drifting while keeping your plane under control. The game features Career mode which is a series of different events, Grand Prix is a race to see who is the best, Time Trial is what you would expect, and Single Race is for racing on only one track, which I advise to try this feature out for practice if you just bought the game. The power ups can be useful at times, from the catchers mitt that catches the enemies weapon and being able to use it to your advantage, to chucking snowballs, ho ho ho. The All Star moves are back but are a bit disappointing. The first game featured the characters having their own specific All Star Moves with their own style and advantages, the sequel just transforms the player into the plane mode and fire's rockets at your opponents. There was also talk about special DLC that would feature more of SEGA's forgotten or internet favorite characters in the game, well it's been over a year and after that Yogscast guy was announced, I gave up on it since obviously SEGA only focuses on Sonic, they don't give a damn about their other franchises or even attempt to feature them in a new game again, and not just constantly porting their already made games onto every console. Besides, a good amount of people who bought this game only bought it just because it has Sonic characters, hence why the name Sonic is in HUGE font while the rest of the title is in smaller font. I rarely play as any of the Sonic characters from the first game (I use Bonanza Bros. all the time) and in this game. They're nothing special compared to all of SEGA's unique and forgotten creations. The 3rd Party batch of characters are very random and are just thrown in there for advertising gimmicks but hey, you can play as Pryo, Heavy and Spy that represent Team Fortress 2 in this game. So yeah, if your one of those few people that like SEGA's forgotten characters like myself, then you will enjoy this game like it's predecessor; you've got NiGHTS, Amigo, a living VMU named AGES, Vyse, Shinobi, and more.............................. but no Vectorman. :'(			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is an extremley fun and addicting racing game much like Mario Kart, bringing back a lot of nostalgia for me back when I played hours upon hours of Mario Kart Doubledash on the Game Cube. The roster of All-Star racers rangers from iconic and not so iconic sega characters, characters from a few games and movies and even real life F1 Racer Danica Patrick... Interesting to say the least. The game can shift from three diffrent vehicle types during a race while adding stunt combos and an array of unique items to that of Mario Kart witch I actually prefer a lot more! I like this game a lot aswell as my roommates in college who regularly come in to join and play with me haha, brings back a lot of nostalgia.. And its cheaper then buying the whole game cube setup and doubledash.Pros:- Good Announcer and Sound Track- Visually stunning race maps with nice use of colors- Near Flawless Gaming Mechanics- Tons of racemodes to choose from during World Tour, Several Grand Pre races- Easy multiplayer match makingCons:- Wish there were more racers or possibly vehicle options for racers- Wish there was a bigger community of people who played this- Could possibly benefit from a DLC map pack "

It's simple to play, huge variety of maps and characters, fast paced, gets everyone laughing and having a great time. There are a few glitches with getting hung up on the scenery and I wish navigating between rounds was a little faster, but this is an example of Sega at the top of their game in my opinion. No, I have no sponsoship deals with them to say that. I just like the game. XD			"

												Addicting! You can have some serious fun when playing this with friends, but it's also very nice on single player. It has famous SEGA characters to play with, from the classic games since before the Dreamcast era until the new ones. The flying and water controls might be a little difficult to get used to, and the challenges to gain stars to unlock new cars and features are harder than its previous title. If you like colorful tracks, cars that has guns with funny noises and effects and losing friends just like in Mario Kart, that's the game.			"

												I'll type a review, so here it is. Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed is a great game, it's a game where players can race each other, there's something about that, racing people, that makes this game great, a real winner. Why just the other day I raced someone, it was a great race, great things were accomplished, and greatness was achieved. That's what this game does, it just wins and keeps being great. The races can be won, sometimes you fall behind, but does that mean you're a loser, of course, but someone has to be the winner, and that's what makes this game great, is because someone is always a winner. You have to race to win and in order to win you have to be great and that's what this game is, just something special. Thank you.			"

												This is a very well made Mario-Kart styled racing game which brings some of the iconic from Sega as you already recognized in the name of the game.There is a total of 30 playable characters in the game,each of them differ from the others,some are faster,some are slower etc.Now a big plus in this game is that the map you're playing on changes each time you reach the finish line,meaning a 3 lap race will not look the same all the time.You can be driving your kart and then all of a sudden road ends and you find yourself flying in the air while dodging many powerups your enemies throw at you.Also one of the pros is that this game has 4 person local COOP, which allows you to do the campaign with your friends.Its a big plus since in some of the events you could really use some help.You unlock your characters by completing levels and each level you get you unlock a mod for your car,which can be a speed mod,a handling mode and others.I play this game with my 7 year-old nephew and he absolutely loves it.If youre looking for a game in which you can relax and have some fun then this is the game for you.But be warned you need 2 controllers for COOP.Now the only con is that sometimes its buggy and the AI are extremely difficult if you crank up the settings.In some events you get absolutely annihilated and it kinda makes you rage.My final verdict is a very,very solid 9/10.

												Traditionally Kart racers have always struggled when pitted against the might Mario Kart series. SEGA have built upon the first game well and are putting up a great challenge to the crown.SEGA understand that a successful kart racer needs a mix of good tracks, great items, and fun characters. Most of the tracks in the game are brilliantly designed. A lot of them take into account the ability to transform between the three available states; kart, boat, and plane. This enables the tracks to evolve with each lap, offering racers something new to look out for.The items are all pretty instinctive, and there aren't too many of them. Every item has it's own use, and none feel like a waste or a duplicate.SEGA has drawn upon it's impressive back catalogue giving players a great variety of characters to drive around as. There's also a few cameos in there (like Team Fortress 2).The racing in the game feels fluid and responsive. The graphics are acceptable. The music is great, with some remixes of classic SEGA tracks included.The ability to transform is done well. It could've been something that was thrown in just as a gimmick, but SEGA have really incorporated it into the game, and it's obvious it was designed around this.By far the best addition from the previous game is online multiplayer. The multiplayer system works brilliantly, and that's what will keep me playing this for a long time.As always with racers, bring a gamepad!Bottom line: A great kart racer, that's even better with friends.

												I hated this game when I first played. I didn't like the tracks switching almost every lap. I didn't like the controls. I didn't like any aspect of it. Then my friend forced this game upon me by buying it and I'm glad he did. I really enjoy this game. The gameplay is pretty rock solid. This game is also certified local co-op! It's as easy as pressing start!""Another Super Mario Kart clone"". Perhaps, but this game does it's best to make sure your paying attention at all times. There is always an opportunity to boost or get ahead but proper steps need to be taken in order to make it to first. The biggest difference in this game in regards to other race battle games is that drifting (to acquire boost) is essentially critical. You don't have to hit an arrow to receive a boost. Rather drifting for a certain amount of time will give you a basic turbo. Keep drifting though and notice the color of your thrusters changing colors. Going from red to blue, you'll notice a definite kick to your character upon doing a successful drift. This is a big feature in this game where now it doesn't seem really appealing, but upon playing it the game mechanics will pull you in. On top of that, don't forget you can do tricks with the right stick if you want more boost!Is there weapons in this game? Of course! Some weapons (and defensive weapons) included are baseball glove (that catches and gives you the weapon fire at you), freeze-balls with the ability to freeze opponents, blowfish that sit like mines, wasp swarms that set up ""roadblocks"", a rocket that locks on to opponents, a firecracker that fires in a straight line, ""going all-star"" which is similar to Mario Kart's star except you can shoot specialized rockets that rebound and follow, boost and explosive hot rod engines. The beauty of firing weapons is that you have the OPTION of shooting them backwards or forwards. This is a neat feature as this adds another depth to the game.The tracks themselves (to say the least) are unique. I imagine it wasn't easy designing one course that would transform throughout the race. I should mention that the ""Transformed"" actually means that your mode of transportation transforms. It can either be a car, a (hover)boat or an airplane. So combine that with the tracks and you can get some challenging races but some over the top scenery to dodge. ""Drifting"" around a dinosaur in an airplane while trying to go through a boost while trying to shoot at an enemy is no easy work. The levels definitely seem like a lot of attention has been given to them.On top of all this, they've added different game modes. The main menu offers career mode, match making and custom game. What is really cool is (local) players can play online as well as play in career mode! Having a hard time with a time attack? Wouldn't hurt to have a buddy to help you out. Some of the varying game modes include boost challenges, evasion, time attack, single race and even attack simulations where you have to destroy a tank while dodging his attacks. Characters themselves have the ability to level up (depending on how much you play with them) and your buddies character can level up at the same time. Upon leveling up, you will unlock certain modifiers for your car (such as boost to acceleration, handling etc...).The visuals are decent graphics but it seems they attempted to pay attention to every little detail. For example, in the main menu there aren't much options regarding maps (as they haven't been unlocked). Upon unlocking them, you'll see more of these maps on your main screen. The maps as I've said are really interesting and really neat to play through. The characters at times will seem to fall out of their vehicle while doing stunts or boosting.The sounds are actually very good as each individual character has different dialogue for different situations. Little diversity concerning the explosion sounds and it would have been complete. I should add that when the announcer is saying 3-2-1 go that the player should hit ""accelerate"" (or RT) every time he says a number. This will give you a boost at the start.Overall, a really good game. It gives Mario Kart a run for it's money  but I wouldn't say it's better or worse. It's tough to compare the two but Sonic Racing is definitely fun.RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BScreenShots :  The usual screen you'll be seeing Drifting and boosting Really not a fan of player 2 being first ""Flyyyy like an eagle"" Nice glimpse into the scenery "

												It's like Mario Kart for PC on steriods. The tracks are all lively and energetic, with amazing music backing it up, it feels like every track is one of those rides at Universal Studios where you go into the movie and see the characters. The huge but somewhat random character selection is nice, too. Difficulty curve is mostly good, however for standard race the three star system doesn't make sense to me...you only need 3rd against easy AI for 1 star, 3rd against medium for 2 stars, but 1st against hard for 3 stars? I stuggle to get that last one, however I usually get first when going for 2 stars, and am rewarded the same as if I got 3rd. Other than that, I think this is my favorite racing game. 9/10(Currently using JoyToKey and Mayflash Adapter to use my GameCube controller with it, it works beautifully)			"

												Make that a thumb sideways.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a mix of Mario Kart-like randomness and chaos, and Trackmania-like skill-based precision racing, and then some more.So it is a game with several very different game-modes and race types, in singleplayer you'll go through all of them, wether you like them all or not. How much fun you will have depends on what kind of preferences of racing game types you have, and I'll try to point out those things in this review.First off, if you're a completionist, going for 100% achievements or as close to that as possible, this game is quite ok into the 70-80% region, and then it becomes difficult, even frustrating, and a game of chance much more than a game of skill. That's a very clear thumbs down from this perspective. Most people don't care about that but I wanted to mention it for those who do.If you're a fan of fun racers with random weapon pickups, this game has alot of that, in singleplayer aswell as multiplayer.The randomness is really really prominent in singleplayer races against AI. No matter how good you are, winning in the hardest (""expert"", unlockable) and second-to-hardest difficulty modes is very difficult mostly, and when you win, you don't have the feeling that you did that, but you just got lucky with the pickups and the enemy AI's rubberband mechanism. Someone might be out there who does enjoy that kind of racing, but I didn't. As mentioned, it's the central part of the game.If you're a fan of driving skill based racing with no element of randomness, this game has some of that, too, and I happen to like those parts. The higher difficulties are a challenge, but it's how well you race that makes the difference, and there's a clear sense of progress and improvement with each retry. You memorize the courses, you spot shortcuts, get a feel for the physics model (unrealistic but that's ok) and the different unlockable drivers that handle differently, and most importantly you learn how to get ""boosts"" by performing slides around corners and stunts during jumps. So you have to keep an eye out for opportunities to do that, and pull it off with some skill and precision. I enjoyed these kinds of races the most. They come in different variations and make up about 1/3rd of the singleplayer game. Those variations are racing against the clock/against a pre-recorded non-random ghost, racing against AI but without weapons, drift challenges, boost challenges, and ring races in air levels.There are sections in the levels (with varying extent per level) of air and boat racing, that handle quite a bit differently. The air controls are a disaster, imho. The slower you are, the faster you turn, which is ok on paper, but it makes handling steep curves extremely imprecise and frustrating, especially when the curve is not only left/right, but at the same time upwards/downwards. They should have looked at the 15 year old Pilotwings 64 to get an idea of how to design good, uncomplicated but precise controls for such a game mode.The great downside to the game as a whole is, that, unless you happen to like all of these different kinds of racing, you'll hate some parts of the game. Due to how the singleplayer progression is designed, you can't really ignore those parts, if you want to progress through the game.			"

												Do you like Mario Kart?Do you think it's too slow?Do you wish it had a 500cc mode?Then this is the game for you! Maybe it's not like 500cc, but probably around 300cc. I played this a lot and then went back to Mario Kart DD on the GC and it was really slow. This game is a lot more fun as any Mario Kart game I have ever played. If you enjoy racing games overall, you need to try this game at least.There is some problems on older low specced computers as well, just keep that in mind. It can also crash from time to time as well, but it's not too bad.The music is also great, but can get repetitive after a while. Haven't found a way to change it yet either. For some reason the decided to compress it in a completely other way than all the other Sonic games. That may be because it uses VAC and if you modify the music files you could get a VAC ban or something probably. That also means that there are no mods for this game, which kinda sucks.Anyway, it's a great game.I give this game 9/10.			"

												It is currently the free weekend for this game, and all it took, was a single, short race, in order for me to purchase it! I love this game. I've been hooked on it, all day. My brother and I have had several matches, I've been on single-player a fair bit, and I've played with some random people, online. All in all, my experience, so far, has been a great deal of fun, and wowing at the surprisingly tasty visuals, given the style of graphics.The game runs beautifully for myself, with an ASUS 760 OC, and my brother, with an XFX HD-5750. You might well have already gathered, but this game is simply not that graphically taxing. My brother and I both have an FX-4100 - mine is overclocked to 4.2GHz, whereas my brother's CPU is at stock, and for him, the game runs at 60fps, at a 900p resolution, with everything maxed, except he has motion blur disabled. I have even gone a step futher, and forced 8x Supersampling, and 16xQ CSAA - the game still runs butter-smooth. So, to summerize, this game should run beautifully, provided you're not running a computer with a Pentium CPU, 32MB SD-RAM, an ATI Rage 4MB GPU, and Windows 95, like my first Windows computer!One of the things I love about any game, are things that I can unlock and earn. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has more under the hood, than you might initially think. You'll see on Steam, that there are in-fact - as of this review's post date - 50 Steam achievements to earn. To my knowledge, there are 144 career stars to earn, ranging from various game-modes, with 3 difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. There is a GP mode (Grand Prix) allowing for 10 Grand Prix Wins. Time Attack mode sports 40 tracks on which to race, 20 being entirely different. There are 160 Staff Ghosts to beat, and each one is a different difficulty of time made on each track, from Easy to Expert. The game has 28 vehicles/characters to choose from, each with Mods, totaling 168 unlockable Mods, and if that wasn't enough, they can each be leveled up 6 times, using a simple experience system. While playing the game, you will do some impressive, and not-so-impressive things, earning you stickers - there are 100 stickers to collect, 3 of which can be shown-off on your license.As of the post date, there 2 bits of DLC available to you, currently £4.98 in total. I must admit, the DLC doesn't interest me, as I simply don't feel it justified to pay for minor content I feel might as well have just been in the game, at launch. To each their own, as they say.I do find the graphics to be very pleasant. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed uses only DirectX 9, so don't expect flashy DirectX 11 features; this is a Sonic racing game, pure and simple.The music gives me a sense of nostalgia, with that unmistakable, Sega sound, however, after a while, the constant ""Sega sound"" blaring in your ears, may start to drive you crazy, so consider turning down that music, or disabling it!The controls are tight, simple, and easy enough to learn, provided you don't struggle with the TV remote, or putting on slippers. The wired XBOX 360 controller, works like a dream with this Sonic game, so don't hesitate to plug it and press that Start button. In-fact, it's so nice and comfy with the controller, that I've never tried it with the K&M!You might be wondering whether the multiplayer modes are any good - well, from where I'm sitting, they are great, with all the typical game modes found in single-player, and the ability to choose the very same characters/vehicles you've been leveling up and modding, all of which adds to a brilliant experience with your family, mates, or indeed strangers.All in all, I've had a lot of fun on this little gem, and I would certainly, strongly recommend it to any Sonic fan, or a fan of relatively old-school, kart-style racing.

-Quick Review-Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is a Racing game developed by Sumo Digital, and released Jan 31, 2013. To sum up the game, it's basically like playing Mario Kart but with more content.(I don't want to say better or worse then Mario Kart, it really should be counted as it's own ""kart"" game, and not a knock off or anything like that)


There are three kart modes: Car, Boat, and Plane/Jet.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There's no story here, I could totally make one up for you though... With riviting details about how Sonic Team has sold their blue heghog to the highest bidder, and is now enslaved in a kart game where he must prove himself to be the best to win each and every game so that he will be able to compete in the obligatory Mario Vs Sonic Kart Game which will someday be developed (or was already developed and no one cared because it was for the wii-u)!*links my blog site where you can read more fan art*My Xbox 1 controller doesn't work: I recently purchased an x-box 1 controller and have been trying to cover controller controls on games with my reviews, but for this one apparently it doesn't like my xbox 1 controller. I just grabbed an x-box controller, I didn't know some games don't like 'em. I even tried downloading a button mapper which would emulate a regular x-box controller... no dice.In the end it was too much work, and I just concluded I'll get better with a keyboard and mouse, the problem is you don't know all the buttons unless you read a guide or somehow guess each button.Here's the basic's to get you started: Space is Drift, arrow keys will direct you, Shift to accelerate (P.S. your pinky-finger will hate you after a few races), and E to fire a weapon. You can also flip using WASD but I forget about the flips because I'm a baddy mcbad-face.If you want to save some time, check out any of the top rated Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed beginer's guides located here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/212480/guides/Gameplay: There are three game play types in Sonic All stars racing transformed (Yeeesh that's a lot to type, can we just call it Sonico-kart? No? what's that? there's a ""Sonic and SEGA All Stars Racing"" game in my library I will be reviewing eventually too? Well crap.)

There are three game types: Career, Match Making, and Custom Game.For the Career you play against the AI, having easy, medium, and hard difficulty NPC's. In world tour there are 5 worlds and roughly 8 levels each world, plus character unlocks. In Grand Prix there are 5 cups, and 4 races per cup, lastly there's a lot of levels in time attack and single race mode (as you can imagine you can play all the levels individually, and there are also bonus levels!)Regarding Match making, you can play online in three game modes: Race, Arena, and Lucky Dip, there are also respective stats, win loss ratio, games played wins, and ratings, for all you junkies who aren't desensitized yet.Custom Game is exclusively for multiplayer, you can play local co-op, if you have enough controllers plugged in, you can play with up to 4 friends locally (we actually did do this when my brothers came to visit, they beat most of the Career for me... wait, should I not admit that?) and online you can play with your online friends.Okay, so we've talked about the types of game modes, and pretty well spelled out there's a lot of different levels to keep you busy for some time... How does the game FEEL?Well, it feels like a Mario Kart Game, but with Sonic Characters and Danica Patrick. (I don't know jack about racing people, but apparently she's in this game, along with other Sega characters, Wreck it Ralf, and... who the heck is Pudding?) You race along a course, the course will sometimes change on the last lap of a race, you pick up items, some will boost you, some will you aim and throw, others help the last place scrublord like me while playing online (...you could at least let me win one people, come on!)


As you play, you will unlock mods for the characters you're playing which will change how the vehicle preforms.  - Uploaded for Steam Review

Conclusion:  I'm not the best person to speak to when it comes to potential that a racing game has because I'm not particularly skilled at them to begin with, but I could easily see this game being the type of game you play with a group of friends like many of us used to do back in our Mario Kart Days on the N64. (Appeal to Nolstalgia successful *blows off gun smoke)What I'm trying to say is; I liked it. I'll play it more, I'm not good at it, but I don't feel like I need to be good at something to enjoy it.Hopefully this review has been either entertaining, informative, or inspiring. My name's Atratzu and I approve this review.			"

You can pick your character, the mode which you will use in racing, you can represent your badges/stickers in online play, you can play different modes, play World Cup, Tour... and alot of things. The best thing that they have made - Graphics, Gameplay. It is really fun and relaxing to race along with such beautiful maps, and such smooth controlls. This game has a few mistakes, issues, and things.. [Controllers, Controller Menu, Settings, Glitches] But it doesn't make it bad. This is one of the best racing games, and it will stay the best!If you never played this, you are missing a bunch, so why are you looking at the reviews, you are suppose to play this beautiful game!Rate: 60/10			"

												For fans of the Mario Kart series, you will not be disappointed.Most clones of Mario Kart tend to be pretty terrible. Nearly unplayable, with ugly graphics, horribly designed stages, uninteresting characters, and just... not very fun to play in the slightest. They tend to be just quick cash ins on the Mario Kart crowd. Sega's latest crossover extraveganza doesn't fail to please. While, at the core, it may look like just your typical Mario Kart clone, it is so much more. Not only do you race by car, but mid-race, you could find your car transforming into a boat or plane.There's a single player campaign mode that allows you to play through a ton of challenges. Drifting, tank fights, flying through rings, and standard races. There's plenty to see and do in All-Stars Racing Transformed. There's a huge variety of weapons at your disposal to take out the competition and while not as interesting as those found in the Mario Kart series, they are fun to use and do the job. With 20 tracks (21 if you count the DLC track) and a currently still ever growing roster of characters, the fun is endless.Did I mention the online is fantastic, as well? Because it is. It's your standard online with 5 different game modes, but there is absolutely no lag, which is always a plus.So, if you're a fan of Mario Kart and also love SEGA and their IPs, you'll love this game.

												I love to play this very fun arcade racer with my Girlfriend and Friends in Big Picture @ Home TV with Xbox 360 Controller. It has online multiplayer as well as local multiplayer.Its like Mario Kart, but i think its better. (yes, hate me for that)DO NOT play with a keyboard and mouse!!!!The Game:Boost, drift, find new power-ups and shoot enemys. Discover alternate routes and level up your Character to get better skills.Each character is equipped with their own unique vehicle that can transform into a car, boat and plane to take advantage of the changing terrains.Fun gameplay, no over powered weapons, and a good sense of speed. If you like games like Mario Kart then you will love this. DO NOT buy it for 10 @ Amazon or 20 @ Steam (and 20€ = 20 $ ?? the prices are not correct...) but get the Game @ Steam-Sale for 5 Bugs or in a Bundle (Humble Bundle etc.). (In addition @ Steam the DLC for this game is worthless, they  just adding new characters. WTF? SEGA = EA ?)			"

												I enjoyed the first All Stars Racing game, but honestly I got bored with it pretty quick after finishing all the cup races. This is a fantastic sequel. The courses are better and they change a bit during each lap. The racing feels a bit faster. Racing now takes place in land, water and air, they all have a different feel and handling. Characters now rank up, so that adds some replay value. There is much more to do in this game than the previous with different game modes, including Online racing. "

The racing mechanics are tight as tight, the tracks are numerous, varied and interesting and there's enough content in the game to keep you playing for a long time.

												•	   Having your vehicle transform into four different shapes gives the game a great deal of variety. That, combined with the fact that most of the tracks change every other lap, makes it so that you don’t feel like you’re always doing the same thing.•	         Having seven different mods for every character makes it so you can use whatever character you like, even if you can’t deal with the way it initially plays (lack of handling / acceleration / speed / etc).•	         Has a decent amount of tracks (and of course, mirror versions) but could use some more. One of the DLCs added an extra track, but since not everyone has it, it never gets selected in online matchmaking. In addition, the new track feels pretty bland, there aren’t many obstacles or variety at all.•	         S class is pretty damn hard, mainly due to abusive amounts of rubberbanding. But once you master those tracks, it’s an awesome challenge and feels pretty rewarding to win. However, even S class isn’t much compared to online matchmaking, especially if you put yourself in a lobby full with players with their ranks in the 1500’s or above. S class challenges are also pretty difficult and require practice most of the time.•	 The online matchmaking itself works pretty well and it’s fun, but there’s (arguably) too much time between races. Ten seconds to vote for one out of three tracks, and then forty-five seconds just to choose a character is too much. Also, don’t make me choose my character after every race. Just give me the same one I used in the previous one by default. If I want to change into another one, I can…after all, I have forty-five seconds to do it….•	         Speaking of characters, the AGES character comes as a pleasant surprise, with its unique sounds and transformations which you’ll no doubt recognize. On the other hand, having NiGHTS and Reala in the game AS THE vehicle feels like a bad joke. At least their All-Star transformations look good.•	         There’s a healthy amount of achievements, even though it would have been cool to see every in-game sticker have its own. Some achievements involve playing with four local players, which is not a good idea. Not many people have that amount of controllers, not to mention the fact that split-screen multiplayer is becoming a thing of the past. It would have been more sensible to make these achievements doable with Steam/PSN friends.•	         The game runs great and looks amazing and crisp on PC, but as usual with sonic PC ports, there’s a specific zone (in this case the Samba Studios track) that tends to drop the framerate. That being said it’s still a pretty good port, but still suffers from the same problem as all the other sonic PC ports that came before it: the graphical options menu is in a separate executable and must be run before the game. Also it forces you to skip through a bunch of stuff before you get to the main menu every time you launch the game but at least on the PC, there’s a fix for that.As a conclusion, this is definitely an extremely satisfying and challenging game, especially if you have a couple of friends to play online with. SEGA will certainly milk this game some more by slowly adding more characters as they’ve been doing in the past. This is reinforced by the fact that the game is still selling and the online community is still pretty active.The game isn’t expensive and has been on sale again and again, with prices reaching under 7€ at times. Definitely a good buy for any fan of SEGA and/or kart racers. And since I don't like to read reviews by people who barely play the games either, here's some of my Personal Stats:•	55 hours played so far (still play occasionally)•	50/50 Achievements Unlocked•	Game completion: 102% "

												One of the best kart racing game on the PC. It brings back my fond childhood memory (I've played Crash Team Racing on PS1)!The race changes during each lap which brings a refreshing experience. This game is very much skill-based and having a paint scratch might make a difference between winning and losing the game. There's a lack of weapon variety but you still have to use them wisely. Overall, awesome soundtracks, great multiplayer, and the game runs smoothly on my GT 335M and an ultra low voltage CPU, which is a darn good console port. Not to mention the near-obsolete split-screen support! I recommend buying this if you are going to play with your friends or even alone.			"

												A very fun kart racing game available on PC:*Solid mechanics;*Good controls (although using a controller is a must);*Decent presentation;*The soundtrack is fitting;*Runs smoothly.My only major complaint is that it is a bit too easy.I still think you should be able to unlock content even when playing online with a friend, but I digress.It's a great game, I definitely recommend it if you're looking for an arcade racing game or a serviceable substitute for Mario Kart.

												Oh god, so much memories awoken by this game, awesome animation, graphics and tracks. Soundtrax made me cry. God, I really love it. I recommend it to anyone, even to these who never played Sonic game series. It got lots more tracks than Sonic And SEGA All Stars Racing, and more events, though Misson section got changed, and has different structure. There are more Grand Prix'es than your eye can see, plus multiplayer mode to play with your friends or random people in Steam. This game is freakin' AWESOME!!!			"

Note: I have not completed the game yet, I am writing the review as a ""first impressions"" kind of thing.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. I recently acquired the game on a sale, as it looked like a fun little racer. I went into the game pretty much blindfolded, not sure of what to expect.Gameplay and World:Good:» Tons of special modes like VS-Mode, drift-challange, boost-challange, etc.» Unique and beautiful tracks, which can even change inbetween laps.» Lots of choosable characters with different strengths and weeknesses.» In-depth risk and reward boost-system (boost for stunts and drifts).» Many fun powerups to use.» Surprisingly difficult on harder difficulties.» Options for touch-inputs and different sensors. Not something I'd use, but that is a very rare feature to see.Bad:» All PC-Related settings, like graphics and controls, have to be set in a broken and cheap-looking launcher.» How the AI uses powerups can be very frustrating at times, ruining the flow of the race.» Some characters feel very out of place. Some are more cartoony than others.» Drifting + Braking/Reverse use the same key, which makes sense on a controller, but not on a keyboard.» Shadows look kind of grainy, even on high graphics-settings.» Nitpick: Default keyboard layout is horrible (can be changed in the launcher tho).Misc:Settings:Ingame, only some gameplay and sound-settings are available. When you get the launcher to work (running as administrator), you have lots of graphics settings to your disposal. Every resolution seems to be supported. The launcher is just not clear on what kind of anti-aliasing it uses (spoiler: it's FXAA).Performance:This game performs beautifully! Surprisingly, I was able to get it running on my Windows-Tablet (Intel Atom, with integrated graphics) at 640x400 with 15-30 FPS. Would not have thought that it would get anywhere near that. So feel free to try this on a low/mid-spec PC, it's very well optimized.Summary:I was positively suprised by this game. I had my fears that this was gonna be some arcade-racer for kids, without any difficulty whatsoever, but it definitely proved itself to be a challenging and fun racing-game. If you like arcade-racers like Mario Kart and you are searching for an equivilant on PC, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is for you. Although it might be a little hard to get into if you are new to the racing-game genre. Definitely give it a spin!			"

												Mario Kart for PC. They did an amazing job with this game, the level design is really well done and the way the levels change from lap to lap leading to seemless boat and air sections is brilliant. Loads of your favourite SEGA characters from Sonic, Nights, crazy taxi, and loads more and even a couple of wacky ones such as football manager. HIGHLY recommended, especially if you have a few buddies to play against. Worth the full price even in my opinion.Game Showcase-

												This game has really an interesting concept of racing although it seems to resemble mario kart.Nevertheless it has got individual characteristics like changing environmental elements or the different mod/stickers/characters you can unlock during the gameplay. (Btw ive never played mario kart in person but a comparison would be unnecessary anyway at this point.Therefore i played crash bandicot racing which strongly reminds me of it).I really enjoyed the gameplay mechanics and the different kind of gameplay mods which are offered and i have to say it's really enjoyable, especially playing with friends / online.The only thing which might be frustrating for beginners is the fact of being pushed from 1st place to the last place by certain items used by the opponents , but dont worry, that's one of the funny part of this game and it still has more to offer.My only personal complain is: i feel like there is a lack of battle items (or tracks) , but maybe that's just my personal taste.All in one im really glad to own this game , it always makes fun no matter what and it's definitely a good option for me to have a good change in choosing certain gametypes.i recommend this for you. you have my approval.  play it and have fun :)			"

												This has got to be one of the best kart racing games on PC. Rivaling giants like Crash Team Racing and Mario Kart.You get plenty of vibrant stages and characters to choose from. You can play the local career with 4 people or do racing in a variety of modes: single races, time attacks, capture the Chao or cup races and can also take part in battle modes locally, online for up to 10 player or even combined.And I didn't even get into the awesome power up system, the Transforming vehicles and stages that transform each lap.Simply put this game is packing content and you should already have it in your Steam library if you love Racing Games like Mario Kart. Or have ever wanted to try these types of games out.			"

It really took me back to when racing games were FUN! If you're a fan of less serious racing games like the Mario Kart series, Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (of which it shares a lot of similarities with), or the Hot Wheels series to name a few, I'd definitely suggest checking it out RIGHT NOW!

B.D. Joe & All-Stars Racing Transformed is wonderfully arcadey, bright, colorful, runs silky-smooth and is generally a truckload (or boatload (or planeload)) of fun to play. It's the best racing game I've played in a long time.+ Colors! Cheer!+ Arcadey+ Challenging+ Makes very effective use of Wii-tier models & textures - Looks great and runs very nicely+ I've only played a couple of the games represented in this game for a few minutes apiece and I still love almost all of the characters (Amigo)+ Good soundtrack+ Lag shouldn't effect your movement too much online, with one major exception...- Vehicle-on-vehicle collisions online. Good God, the vehicle-on-vehicle collisions online. Some games try to handle physics but it still doesn't work too good. This game just doesn't handle physics. They don't even work for the host player. Works okay offline, though.- S-Class AI tends to be a bag of ♥♥♥♥♥- There is a ramp on Burning Depths that you can crash into while trying to go over it, and you will lose if this happens. This is dumb.Verdict: I love it.9/10			"

Then there's a sega sale with 90% price cut, so I think what the heck I might as well get one. And the experience? is amazing!Despite the fact this game were released under the seventh generation of console, it has a great graphic. Running smoothly 1080p 60fps on my steam link. Heck, I can even run this game on my 2006 Core 2 Duo with medium setting and a decent fps. Works great with my F710 without a problem at all.

Unfortunately the multiplayer is pretty dead these days.  I got this game when purchasing the Sega Collection for a very nice deal a couple years ago.  Being hopelessly bored one day, I decided to try the game out.  I was not disappointed.I recently played Mario Kart 8 for the first time on a friends Wii-U.  Sonic racing was easily better.  The game can be a real challenge sometimes.  The scenery is amazing throughout the levels as well.  I found myself playing the crap out of this game until I'd pretty much gotten every achievement besides the multiplayer ones.If you can find this game cheap and don't mind single player racing, this game will take you for a wild ride that you will not soon forget!

												First, I had issues starting the game because of ASN_App_pcDx9_Final. It seems others have the same issue, here is how I fixed it. Go to the games local files folder (right click game in steam library-preferences-local files-browse local files) the copy the ASN_App_pcDx9_Final file, paste it into the same folder (you will now have a file named ASN_App_pcDx9_Final - copy) rename the ASN_App_pcDx9_Final - copy to ASN_App_pcDx9_Final.EXE then start the game again and it should work!This game really is as enjoyable as Mario Kart and is certainly a good alternative that works well on PC. The visuals are great for a karting game. I will give a full review and rating when I have played the game more. I just wanted to share the fix information			"

												Basically Mario Kart for the PC, with all the same fun.  The controls are great on an x-box controller and work suprisingly well on just a keyboard if thats all you have.  The only issue ive seen is that some computers will load the game after the race has already began, this seems to happen more with computers with slower harddrives, so occasionally in some races you will start out with a cler handicap if you have an slow harddrive.  This can be mitigated by having the person with the slowest harddrive host the games, but even then i've seen the game load after the game started.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, in case you can't tell from the title, is a racing game, and the sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. In this game your car transforms into a plane or boat depending on what the course calls for at certain points. As you play the game you earn experience points, and when you level up, you earn a new mod for that character. Mods are changes to how your character's vehicle handles. Because you have to level up each character individually to unlock all the mods for all the characters, it can either be something that adds replay value for you, or be an unfun grind. Aside from the usual grand prix and versus modes, there is a quest mode as well, where you complete challenges to earn stars that allow you to unlock more characters, mods for characters, and of course more challenges. Some of these challenges can be really difficult at times, and to top it off there's also an extra difficulty to unlock that makes these challenges even harder. While the game doesn't have as many power ups or courses to choose from as Mario Kart games have nowadays, the gameplay is solid, and the courses often have multiple paths you can take that act as shortcuts. So far in these Sega All Stars games, I think this one has the best fan service. It's also the best looking and best sounding game in the series. This game is available for multiple platforms, but I recommend getting it on Steam assuming you have the specs to run it, since the Steam version has more exclusive characters than any other version, including an exclusive DLC character.

												Great looking kart racer.Perfect to play with friends and I didn't have any problems trying to play an MP game, even in the middle of the night.However after Medium difficulty, the SP AI starts cheating pretty hard, and in order to even catch up, you have to perfect all the trick boosts and not miss a single track boost. Even then, 1 or 2 shots on you will probably knock you out of the race, and all AI drivers will be focused on attacking you.So it pretty much turns into a 9v1 gauntlet.It wasn't fun for me to try to complete the game like that, but for people who enjoy the challenge, and like perfecting all the tracks and don't mind some cheaty AI, then you will probably put many many hours into this.

												I normally don't care for anything 'Sonic,' having grown up with Mario, and I don't care much for cart racers also but man, this game is awesome. Loads better than Mario Kart, in my opinion, with better design, flow, weapons, track layouts, presentation, etc. Don't really like the boat parts, but the car and plane parts is really fun. No cheap ♥♥♥ weapons like MK's stupid blue shells.I don't really know any of these characters besides the PC exclusive ones and Sonic ones (obviously), but that doesn't stop me from having a blast with this game.

												Racing games have been a huge genre in the gaming industry, most racing games are really popular, like Mario Kart, Forza, etc., and there are really bad ones like Big Rigs Over the Road Racing. Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog in the late 90's made their own spinoff Sonic Racing games, but the first one's were Sonic R, and Sonic Drift, these two games were considered by many to be terrible. then during the time of the PS2, Sega released a new franchise called ""Sega Superstars,"" this game was really mediocre because it was one of the few games on the system to use the Playstation Eye, but it registered poorly, so the game was not good. Sega decided to step back into racing in 2006, with Sonic Riders, released for Gamecube, Xbox, PS2, and PC, this game was much better than Sonic R and Drift, it was different because unlike most racing games, this racing game used hoverboards, and a sequel was released in 2008.2 years after Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sega decided to revive Sega Superstars with a tennis game before 2010, and in 2010, we got Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This racing game released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, DS, and PC, recevied really positive reviews. So much that it could start comparing to Mario Kart.2 short years after Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing, we got the game were talking about today... Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. Released for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii U, PC, 3DS, PSVita, and mobile devices. So, is this a good racing game? Yes. The graphics on PC are stunning, especially in Max Settings, running 60fps, the colors are bright and colorful, and the small blur affects make the game a bit more intense. The gameplay plays like its original, Steer, Accelerate, Drift to charge up a mini turbo, and do tricks in mid air, which is replaced by flicking the right control stick in a specific direction, (I'm assuming you have a controller) the trick system is a lot simpler and quicker than the original.The main gimic of this game is the ability to transform your kart into a boat, or plane, in boat form, you can ride the waves and  perform tricks by jumping off waves, specifically big ones, and even ride on hot lava, literally. In plane form, you can fly around in the air, while doing barrel rolls to dodge mid air obstacles, such as giant dinosaurs, construction areas, magic bookshelves, and flying aircrafts.The game has a wide variety of modes, race, grand prix, time attack, world tour, battle mode, and even online, and the game has 20 race tracks and a large selection of Sega characters, and I mean it. You can even level up your favorite character and unlock mods for your character to customize their stats! So you can use your favorite character and still have good stats! Also, there are a handfull of collectable stickers and badges to put on your ID card.The soundtrack in this game is really good, with many remixes, but voice clips are resused from past Sega games. But it is still nice to listen to to say the least.If I had to give a final verdict on the game, I would say if Sega's goal was to make a racing game that uses features from many other Sega franchises, and bundle it all into one epic racing game, than they accomplished that very well, the gameplay is good, the soundtrack is epic, the online is fun, the selection of characters is great, and the graphics are beautiful to look at on the PC, but not so much on the Console versions of the game. This is a fantastic racing game that will keep you playing for hours, and has really fun online, I can safely say that this is one of the best racing games out there. I score this game with a 9/10. $20 is a good price, but in the steam sales, $5 is ridiculous, you better buy this in the sales! I reccomend this to any racing fan out there! "

												it was worth for me after i heard that voice saying ""SEEEEEGGGAAAAAA"" at the beginning like if you play sonic on a sega megadrive/genesis but let me tell u something about the game. u have diffrent modes like Worldtour (where u can do challenges like drift-challenge, battle-challenge, ring-challenge where u get stars to unlock new challenges), Grand Prix, Race against time (vs staff ghosts too) and Single race. this is mostly standard i know but there is this awesome ""Player 2 connected* voice after u press the start button on a controler up to 4 players (you can make the voice rage too by rapidly press the button with 4 mates local) and you can play everything in the game with your local friends, (dat means every mode even online vs 6 others.) online you can play with 10 players in races or battle modes. The music is typically beginning of 2000 videogames and the background animations are like in every sega game wonderful, u got very much to see if u can handle it while drivin. and dont forget this is ""Transformed""... this means u transform between a boat, car and a plane wich is awesome (the boat isnt that much but hey the other guys around the world dont like it too) so if you have friends (dont laugh, some dont have) then buy this on a sale, buy a sixpack for you and your 3 friends, prepare 1 (really guys, i recommend just one) spliff and you will get a really funny night. repeat it every time you had a bad day but just if you dont have to work the next day cuz u cant stop with friends.

												The best game your money can buy, if you're looking for some fun.* Only on sale!I have never actually played Mario Kart, I don't even own some Nintendo console, but I am a big fan of some Open Source kart racing games like TuxKart. Levels are well designed, packs some challenge as i an absolute blast to play with family and friends. The Keyboard controls are not bad, get a controller for your friend and you're set. Has splitscreen for multiple friends, and upto 4 people can play simultaneously. Having said that, have never tried online multiplayer, but local coop is incredibly fun.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Tranformed is possibly the most underrated game I've seen on steam thus far.I mean, it's a massive shame it's not getting the attention it deserves because this game is a brilliant racing game.The game's gameplay is more a kart racing in the sense of Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, you got item pick ups such as missles, shields, bombs, etc. Most items are very similar to games like Mario kart, such as the firework which works the same way as the green turtle shell. However this game has an item known as ""All star!"", this item is very rare and once you find one, you can turn into your charater's special ability, which can range from Sonic's Super Sonic form, Eggman's barrage of missles and so on and so forth.In terms of character selection there is a wide range of characters, starting with Sonic the Hedgehog (duh), NiGHTS, Ai Ai from monkey ball, beat from Jet set Radio and pudding from space channel 5. Exclusive for the PC version of the game are the Spy, heavy and Pyro from Team fortress 2, Shogun from Total War, Football manager from Football manager and General  Winter from Company of heroes 2, who are pretty halarious to see in a Kart racing game. The main meat of the game is World Tour mode, this is where you complete a variy of races and modes to gain stars to unlock more levels, characters until you reach the end. Then you got your usual modes such as racing and some new ones like drift challenges.The tracks are varied taking locations from games such as golden axe, Sonic, NiGHTS, etc.One new feature of All-Stars Racing Transformed from it's predecessor is the ability to transform your vehicle into a boat and plane. When the environment allows it, you can change into a plane to fly fast and take shortcuts, or transform into a boat to scale the seas, this system was very well implemented and I never really had any trouble controlling these different types of navagation.The visuals of the locations, car models and character models are also really beautiful, with bright colours, lush environments and crisp texutres, although the character victory animations are rather stiff.Speaking of victory animations, I've noticed that a lot of voice acting is reused from other games such as Sonic Generations, which while bothering, didn't subtract from the experience overall.The music is also top notch, very varied and are candy to my ears. In the end, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a fantastic racing game, and shouldn't be overlooked.Seriously, it's fantastic, so much so that it is possibly the best racing game I've played on the PC.Good job Sumo Digital.9/10			"

												This game is the next installment of the Sonic & All Stars series, with the first one called Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing. This game has taken the faults of the original game and fixed them, giving you plenty of difficult challenges that will take multiple attempts to complete. The 'transformed' side appeals to the unique change of vehicle throughout the levels, with your vehicle being able to become a car, boat or plane. The car designs are all very well done and represent each character perfectly and each franchise characters belong to usually have a course that corresponds with them. (i.e Egg Hangar for Sonic or Shibuya Downtown for Jet Set Radio) The courses have three laps in most cases and the surroundings change with each level, some telling stories of what's going around you, like a flying pirate ship takeover in the Skies of Arcadia level. They're all very well animated and beautiful to look at, with not a single dull level in the roster, my favourite being Dream Valley, reminiscent of NiGHTS. You have a choice of doing the career tour mode or individual races, with each cup having levels from C-A and when you unlock it, S. These make the races/challenges harder for you to earn star points, which buys console mods, characters and gateways to the next cup. I struggle at getting A's, it's incredibly hard to do and takes many tries to figure out the best way to approach a challenge, such as defeating a tank with rocket launchers, drifting in glowing roads before the time runs out or speed racing a ghost character. Overall, it's the best racing game in Sonic's history and I daresay its better than the recent Mario Karts by miles, purely for how much detail went into perfecting this game.			"

												30 hours. All EXPERT events cleared.When it showed ""Congratulations! You are an all-star player"" in the end, I remembered the days I was playing SSAR years ago. I was a high school student then, but not before I became a sophomore did I play SART. And I have been a Sonic fan for about ten years.K let's get into the game. While SSAR is too simple as a racing game, SART is much better. More complicated and hardcore controlling is needed if you want to play SART. Transforming into three different types and different tracks in different laps are also very enjoyable. Unlike SSAR, different characters and different mods are a lot more different in performance. I have to admit that I didn't believe it until at a boost challenge I had failed for hours with Shadow but cleared it only one time with Tails.NPCs in HARD mode and EXPERT mode are cheating. They are usually quicker than us and can accurately hit back, which is very annoying. And other challenges like boost challenge give us very little time. In this game, not every character can finish every challenge. If you get stuck at one event, try changing for another character. I recommend Sonic(Genesis Mod) and Tails(Standard or Handle). The former is heavenly fast while boosting, and the latter is surprisingly flexible. Beginners may have a hard time going through the events, but when they practice for some time, they are sure to complete the EXPERTs. In a word, the challenges in SART are a bit easier than those in SSAR. I can still remember the time I struggling in a star-ring-collecting rank S challenge in SSAR - that was HELL.Like SSAR, SART also has a strange sense of gravity. For example, if you are hit when running upside down, you will not fall off the road. However, it feels good to some extent, for example I enjoy the map Casino Park. Similar to SSAR, maps in SART are all originated from other SEGA games expect one map. But some maps in SART directly come from SSAR, only with a few fixes. Anyway, repetition is better than none.There are few bugs in SART, although mysterious trick fails and turn-arounds happen sometimes.Cars in SART, in my opinion, might be lack of characteristics. SSAR is good, where Tails's car is a plane like the Tornado and Shadow's is a motorcycle from GUN. However in SSAR, Tails's car is just a yellow racing car, and instead of the motorcycle, GUN gave Shadow... a dodgem? lolIn conclusion SART is a good game worth to play. But if you ask me to recommend a Sonic racing game, I would recommend Sonic Riders series. Why don't SEGA bring Sonic Riders on Steam? Never know.P.S. I am not a native English speaker. Sorry for some errors in language.			"

												I was a fan of Sonic from a very early age, and the only Nintendo products in our house were Gameboys, yet I still never thought I'd buy this game. During the 2012 holiday sale I bought the Sonic bundle (before this game was added to it) but I figured this would be no great loss, because after all it's just another Mario Kart clone right? Perhaps and also perhaps not. Sonic has a lot more going on than any other kart game I've played, and doesn't have the same obvious rubber banding that is present on the more recent versions of Mario Kart, which leaves you feeling more in control of what is actually happening on screen rather than having Nintendo pushing you along with magic bullets and saying ""That's it just a little further, the rest of them aren't that far in front of you"" before walloping the person in first place for making the other kids look bad. The Sonic karts handle nicely, the ability to perform stunts has been added to get speed boosts, tracks attempt to cause sensory overload in the most excruciatingly pleasing way possible, and your kart frequently transforms into a boat or plane depending on how the track has been destroyed since your last lap or whatever obstacle is coming up. This is a great game to play with friends, but it's equally as good to play by yourself given all the challenges and unlocks that are available. Unlocks based on game progression are absolutely how this sort of game should be done, so I was somewhat disappointed to find that Sega had released a robotic Sonic DLC - but assuming this is just a skin I suppose you can't blame them for trying to wring every last cent out of us. Mind you, this game was a gift so I'm in no position to have a whinge about that. Had I not been given this game, I wouldn't have realised just how good it is, and how it is well worth buying.			"

												One of the most underrated karting game of all time (Note, by underrated, I don't mean that people hate it, but rather that no one really cares about it). I could ramble a very long time about why you should give it a chance, but here are some good things about it.1: The maps are well designed and can give you a bit of a nostalgic feeling if you grew up with SEGA. The maps are also not that linear compared to other racing games.2: The gimmick of transforming into other forms of vehicles actually works really well and doesn't feel tacked on.3: Variety isn't a problem with this game, as there are many different modes and challenges.4: It's on PC!5: Graphics wise, it looks very nice.6: It's tonnes of fun.Because this is a review, here are a few bad things.1: The character roster has Danica Patrick... Seriously?2: MotionInJoy doesn't work well with the game. (I know that I can't really blame the game, but I had to think of a negative thing :P)  OVERALL:9/10Thanks for reading my review :)			"

												Dare I say this game has more depth than Mario Kart (and I love Mario Kart), this seriously needs more attention than it's getting.The mechanics are simple, and the ""gimmicks"" of having 3 vehicle types keep the would-be mediocre track design of normal kart racers from becoming boring or monotonous.For a console port, it runs amazing and flawlessly integrates with Steam for multiplayer which is really rare.This game is very reminiscent of Diddy Kong Racing, which is a very good thing and I'd reccomend it in a second for anyone new to driving games in general or those looking for a little more than ""Mario Kart X Sequel""(PS: Football Manager, I hate you.)

												This is an awesome fantasy racing game.At first, I thought it would be a cheap copy of the mario kart franchise and, honestly, I bought it as a replacement for that game, a PC alternative - after finishing the entire campaign, which is really addictive, I was surprised and amazed at how it surpassed the former in every single aspect. Below are the key factors behind my mindset.PROS:- Awesome tracks with decent level design, featuring rich environmental details, excellent BGM and diverse gameplay mechanics;- Rich character roster with some oldschool SEGA characters, along with new ones. Each one of them has 3 different vehicle designs well fit to their personalities, used in land/water/air sections of the tracks. They are not some generic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t;- Challenging campaign, which sometimes requires complete mastery of the track.- The PC version is really well implemented, featuring stunning graphics.CONS:- Campaign coop is restricted to local coop. The internet multiplayer works very well, with no lags at all, but doesnt allow campaign mode.- The game locks you between Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties until you reach the last ""world"". Meaning that in order to unlock everything in the game, you are then forced to replay the entire campaign in a new master difficulty that is enabled in that world.8/10			"

												First, I had issues starting the game because of ASN_App_pcDx9_Final. It seems others have the same issue, here is how I fixed it. Go to the games local files folder (right click game in steam library-preferences-local files-browse local files) the copy the ASN_App_pcDx9_Final file, paste it into the same folder (you will now have a file named ASN_App_pcDx9_Final - copy) rename the ASN_App_pcDx9_Final - copy to ASN_App_pcDx9_Final.EXE then start the game again and it should work!This game really is as enjoyable as Mario Kart and is certainly a good alternative that works well on PC. The visuals are great for a karting game. I will give a full review and rating when I have played the game more. I just wanted to share the fix information			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, in case you can't tell from the title, is a racing game, and the sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. In this game your car transforms into a plane or boat depending on what the course calls for at certain points. As you play the game you earn experience points, and when you level up, you earn a new mod for that character. Mods are changes to how your character's vehicle handles. Because you have to level up each character individually to unlock all the mods for all the characters, it can either be something that adds replay value for you, or be an unfun grind. Aside from the usual grand prix and versus modes, there is a quest mode as well, where you complete challenges to earn stars that allow you to unlock more characters, mods for characters, and of course more challenges. Some of these challenges can be really difficult at times, and to top it off there's also an extra difficulty to unlock that makes these challenges even harder. While the game doesn't have as many power ups or courses to choose from as Mario Kart games have nowadays, the gameplay is solid, and the courses often have multiple paths you can take that act as shortcuts. So far in these Sega All Stars games, I think this one has the best fan service. It's also the best looking and best sounding game in the series. This game is available for multiple platforms, but I recommend getting it on Steam assuming you have the specs to run it, since the Steam version has more exclusive characters than any other version, including an exclusive DLC character.

												Even just playing 30 minutes of singleplayer, this game is awesome. It's pretty much just Mario kart but with SEGA characters, but its still amazing. Its really fun how it switches from ground, water, and then air. I havent even tried the multiplayer yet. And the game looks so nice with its cartoony graphic style.			"

												Best modern arcade racing title and one of the best modern racing titles period. It might be cute, colorful, not exceedingly impressive graphically, but this game....in realy: this game is challenging, hardcore, the ultimate racer that MK just can't be.

												I'm not into this kind of games, career, speed or something, but this game has something that makes me keep playing it and still on.In fact, it's because of all those characters from Sega Games and the maps, challenges, leveling your character and of course trying to get all the things that you need, really really worth the game and the time that I've spent on this game so far.

												Really suprising.  I missed this one when it came out and never really heard much about it, but it's a great cart racer with a solid cast and plenty of Sega fan service.  The stages are all lovingly crafted odes to Sega games of yore.  Plus, you can play as Vyse from Skies of Arcadia.			"

												My karting days go way back to the godfather of karting games Super Mario Kart on the SNES. Having played the majority of clones and spin off games since, it'd be fair to say I'm in a decent position to give a valued and trusted opinion.Aside from perhaps Speed Freaks on the PS1, this is hands down the best Mart Kart clone available today. The added flight and boat modes do not take away the fun or karting aspects of the game and really do enhance the experience. I definately recommend this to anyone who enjoys karting games or arcade style racing in general. Well worth the £14 this game is currently listed as. If your lucky enough to catch it on Steam sale, grab it!			"

												There are 2 incredibly unique things about this game. 1) It is a AAA Kart-racer on Steam. You aren't gonna find Mario Kart here, so unless you have a console, this is your only chance. 2) It is hard. Mario Kart and other Kart racers can be hard, too, but that is because of rubber-band AI and cheap items. The items in this game all require thought and skill to use and can be avoided with just the same. The AI is very difficult, but that isn't because they go faster as you get ahead, and if that actually puts anyone off, the online experience is also a great time. Also, as apparent from the recent DLC, it is a game that appreciates its online followings. When Mar becomes playable, we would have the perfect game. Minus a few balancing issues (in SP each lap starts the same, even if your main opponent is up front and you're in back) this is a very worth-while game. Even if it wasn't, though, It is a kart racer on Steam and I can play as JSR characters. It had me sold before I even played it.			"

												I never thought Mario Kart would ever be topped by another kart racing game. I was wrong. This game completely and utterly blows it out of the water. There are so many things Racing Transformed has that other racers only wish they could brag about. The transforming tracks are the biggest reason and I really hope other developers take notes on this. It does wonders for replay value. Even though the same changes happen every time you play a course, this makes tracks stay entertaining for longer. The vehicle transformations may be what the game advertises, but the courses that transform are by far the best part of the experience. And speaking of vehicles, the transformations are actually handled really well. It takes a bit to adjust to the plane controls at the start but it's easy to get a handle on them after a race or two. The dreaded waterboat controls of most racers don't exist here. There's a lot of drifting, but drifting is easy to pull off and most of all fun.There is of course a grand prix mode for single player, but in addition we are given World Tour mode. You select from a map of challenges that unlock as you complete previous challenges and earn stars depending on the difficulty you complete events. The majority of characters in the game are unlocked by possessing a certain amount of stars, so it is a good idea to go back to old events and try them on a higher difficulty. There are many different kinds of events, and the vast majority of them are legitimately fun. Most racing games that attempt this come off as gimmicky, but there's a lot of fun to be had trying the different events out. The AI is also really well balanced. Easy mode is a cakewalk, Medium gives you more challenge but is generally not that bad, and Hard mode is tough but not impossible. An additional Expert difficulty is unlocked and you'll have to be incredibly skilled at the game to pull off wins there.This game has a very wide selection of characters from Sega history, as well as a few guest characters. The roster is well chosen for the most part. Fans of the first game will miss characters like Jacky/Akira from Virtua Fighter, Opa Opa, Bonanza Bros, Zobio from House of the Dead, and the Chu Chus. Newcomers that make up for those omissions include Nights, Vyse from Skies of Arcadia, Joe Musashi from Shinobi, and Gilius from Golden Axe. In addition the pc version adds some characters from Sega's franchises on steam. You can play as Football Manager, the Shogun from Total War, Willemus from Troy, and even Team Fortress. Each character can level up with experience gained from racing, and each level unlocks a different mod. These mods tweak the character's stats, and this is a very good feature. For example I really like Gilius, but he has a terrible acceleration stat. I could use his acceleration mod to increase that in exchange for a lower top speed. This opens up a lot of possibilities and lets you play characters you like regardless of their stats. All in all there is a ridiculous amount of fanservice in the game. I do wish they wouldn't have cut some of the old game's cast, but it's hard to complain when the variety of characters is so great. The course selection is varied as well and balanced between many different locations.To summarize, the game has a ton of content and a ridiculous amount of polish to make it one of the best racing games I've ever played. Everything from the mechanics to the fan service to the single player campaign is well done and I'd love to see Sumo try to top this effort.			"

												We all grew up playing the Mario Kart games.  I remember playing split-screen on the Super Nintendo while others may have gotten their first taste with Mario Cart 64 or Double-Dash.  Its a fun twist on the racing genre and Sonic was long overdue for a spot in the limelight.  That is not to say to this is Sonic's first racing experience but its easily one of his best; it finally puts him on par with his rival.  A ton of different characters and tracks along with superb vehicle handling make this is a top-notch racing game.Game play is key to any racing game and this one is exceptionally smooth.  This game is quite unique in the fact that you race across land, water, and in the sky.  Thankfully, the vehicles handle smoothly across all three modes.  The drifting is very satisfying and is quite easy once you get used to how it feels.  You'll be drifting a lot as you'll get a boost that varies in strength depending on the length of your drift.  If you need some assist there is an array of different power-ups at your disposal.  These range from homing RC drones, to big fat blow-fish, to snow balls.The content in this game, especially in the career mode, is quite astonishing.  First and foremost almost everything can be played via couch co-op which is a rare find these days.  The career will have you compete not only in races but various challenges such as races that require you to constantly drift or races that require you to meet checkpoints while avoiding traffic.  The easier difficulties will make this game fairly accessible while the hard difficulties can be quite challenging.  All the game modes will reward your character with experience points for finishing racing.  These will unlock different mods you can use to change the stats on your vehicles.Sonic is one of a dozen or so IPs represented in this game.  There is a bunch of characters from the Sonic universe including Tails, Knuckles, Amy, and Shadow.  You'll find them racing along the likes of Beat ( Jet Set Radio), Ulala (Space Channel 5), Aiai (Super Monkey Ball), Amigo (Samba De Amigo), Ralph (Wreck it Ralph), and many more.  You'll race across multiple tracks that represent just as many different games.  The character models look just as good as the tracks which are brimming with personality.  Some tracks feature each vehicle mode evenly while others focus one or two more than the others.  Almost all the tracks change each lap giving each race an exciting cinematic feel.Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed is a successful modern twist on the classic kart racer genre.  The races are fast and frantic.  You'll feel great as you pull off tight drifts or knock out opponents sneaking up behind you.  There is a wonderful variety of much loved characters and locations featured in this game.  Bring a friend over to enjoy the robust co-op that is accessible across almost the entire game.  No matter how you play it or who you play as you're bound to have a great time playing this game.			"

												I've just started playing, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way the game tries to expand on th typical four player cart racer scenario. In case anyone is on the fence, this is NOT a Mario Cart type of cash in. The smooth mechanics, interesting visuals, and character balance actually create something incredibly uinique and worthwhile, which is kept fresh by a variety of game modes and complicated stages. I'm looking forward to playing a lot more of this.			"

												This game presents a time and space anomaly of disastrous proportions. If this is not addressed soon, I fear the SEGAverse may collapse in on itself and create a singularity impact that will swallow the third dimension. Not only should it be physically improbable that a russian general can enter a kart race with a tank to race against an anime sky pirate, but the fact that there is a kart racer that could be argued to be as good or possibly better than Mario Kart means that we may have possibly experienced twist in the time lines that has given us a Sonic the Hedgehog kart racer that is not terrible.I will attempt to do more research into the subject, but in brief, my theory is that All-Stars Racing may possibly be a good video game that you would wish to purchase. I will report back when I have received more in-depth results following further testing.			"

The looks of the game are very enjoyable, the sound absolutely immerses us into the game and those weapons you catch remind me of the good old game ReVolt, where you can take down your opponents.The tracks are well balanced, some more difficult than others, of course. The online component is very nice too, you have several modes to play, not just the typical race and it's done.

												This is definitely the greatest kart racer ever on PC, as the track designs are amazing where some tracks actually transform in terms of gameplay and visual while the vehicles in the game are a joy to drive with incredible depth in its handling. Gameplay wise, it is an incredibly fun racing game.However, if you are a completionist or just someone who is looking for a genuinely difficult racing game, this is for you too, as this game can be really difficult to beat at high difficulty which also offer a lot of replayibility. The AI in this game does not cheat as obvious as other racing games, wthout using cheap tactics like rubber band AI, that brings to the fact that this game encourage skilled gameplay that does not present in other racing games.

												Very fun kart racing game. The single player is pretty fun, but playing muliplayer with your friends is awesome. There are 30 different characters in game, in with a different standard style of driving. Each racer has 6 skills - Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, and All-Star. As you level up your racers you unlock mods which change how those skills are spread out. The different tracks and gamemodes can call for a different setup, so you can usually use your favorite racer with a different mod. (And of course Football Manager is the best racer :D )The tracks are based on old Sega game, and most of them change throughout the 3 laps. There are also sections where you transform into a boat or a plane. There are a few different game modes - SP has a World Tour, a Grand Prix, and single race modes. For MP there are:Standard Race - Race for the top position while utilizing power ups.Battle Arena - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Battle Race - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Capture The Chao - A Chao balloon and a capture point spawn in random spots. Bringing the Chao balloon to the capture point adds to the players score. Reaching the target limit or capturing the most before time runs out declares the winner.Boost Race - Race for the top position. There are no items to make use of, only boost pads will help racers in this mode.The boost race isn't that much fun, as using powerups to slow or stun your opponents is the best part of playing a kart game.  The other modes are all very fun though. This is definitely worth picking up during a Steam sale, and if you like kart or racing games $20 isn't bad either.			"

												9.8/10This is probably one of the best Arcade Kart Racers of all time, and my second favorite behind Crash Team Racing (for nostalgia's sake)This game feels like a cross between Mario Kart and Jak-X with a bit of Star Fox 64 thrown in for good measure, the controls are incredibly snappy and drifting is smoother than a cashmere codpiece. I was worried that much like mario kart, the challenge of the game would dissapate once you have gotten quite proficient at it, but I was pleasently surprised to find that a fourth difficulty is introduced once you get far enough into the game.The Transforming feature of this game I initially assumed to be a gimmick, but in actuality It forms an integral part of what makes this game great; the speedboat style parts have realistic water physics (not to mention that the water looks great too), the flight sections of tracks are well designed so that you dont get lost and the flight physics do not take days to figure out (in fact I picked them up almost instantly [after a little oh the vertical is reversed moment]) unlike some games such as battlefield.The Variety of different game types is pleasant; race, battle race, battle arena, etc. however the time trial style mini games in the world tour such as drift challange and traffic attack (which are good fun) cannot be played on all of the tracks.Four of the 21 tracks in the game are direct ports from the previous game, they are fairly good tracks so I can overlook this, one of these is a paid DLC that comes with metal sonic. Honestly I feel this DLC should have been free, but compared to the other DLCs which are literally just extra characters it makes some sense. So completionists beware, if you really want to get every unlock in the game you will need to spend just under $5.00 extra to get those karts.The Graphics in this game; while its not a super duper high-end eye-gasm inducing system-melting dx11 masterpiece, the visuals are very pleasing, it is seamless and themed well, at times you may see a couple of low-res textures or low-polycount models in the backround, reminding you that this is a console port but nothing that takes away from the playing experience.Oh, Yeah thats right, this is a console port! and before you turn tail and run sceaming to your copy of Crisis 3 and proceeding to clutch it while shivering in the corner; It is a wonderfully optimised port, solid 60fps and absolutley no stuttering, input lag or any other issues often asscosiated with console ports (cough.. cough... Trials Fusion).SEGA have been doing a lot of great ports of late, good job you show 'em how its done!I did own the previous game; Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing on Wii briefly, it was laggy, difficult to control and not at all fun to play, but I suppose thats just down to motion control and >30fps that you get with a wii, but Mario Kart Wii played much better than that, so Idk. The point i'm trying to make is that before purchasing All-Stars Transformed I was highly skeptical of it being any good, and well I guess I couldn't have been more wrong.(Nearly done don't worry, It's a miracle you are still reading now to be fair).If you enjoy Fast Paced Kart Action or just want something more exciting than you average Mario Kart game, I would definately Recommend you buy this game, It is worth the full price on store but if you dont want to shell out, then wait for it to go on sale, I nabbed it for Half Price.Now a Couple of Warnings: - Use a 360 controller, the game is perfectly playable on the keyboard but if you dont have n-key rollover you are gonna run into a couple of problems and inevitable frustration. - The Config menu will not launch from steam (at least for me), you need to go to the game directory and set Launcher.exe to run in compatibility mode for XP sp-3. - The Multiplayer Servers are empty, or at least really quiet, the game is fine with out it, but some acheivement and stickers require you to win online races, so again completionists beware.Now buy it and race me online so I can beat you.I'm not joking,Did you buy it yet?Why are you still reading this?

Say what you will about what /exactly/ is being added (IE, Yogscast), but it's still a game that is clearly getting a bit of attention from its developers.Gameplay is an arcadey racer, boosts and pickups are your key to winning.

I bought this game for my son and originally I thought it was going to be way too easy of a racer for me, but it turned out that it was a pretty good challenge for both of us to beat the matches on meduim diffuculty to unlock the new characters. The roster of characters are from a variety of different games and movies, which makes it even more fun for my kids to play as these racing heroes. I recommend this game for anyone that likes the battle racing style.			"

												This is what all Sonic racers should have been. It beats Mario Kart in:-Art-Characters-Speed-Tracks-Skill-MusicThings I don't like:- Inability to turn off the menu music but keep the stages';- The annoying announcer telling you what to do every 30 seconds;- Unstable netcode (sometimes);- Unnecessarily long wait times;- Extremely loud splash screen.This didn't keep me from grossing 200+ hours, though.

It's absolutely gorgeous, has excellent track design, the transforming vehicle gimmick works very well, lots of variety in tracks and racers, unlockable customization options for each racer, and it's just a hell of a lot of fun.Unlike the first All-Stars racing game, this one does have the full set of online modes an options on the PC version. In face, it's an incredibly solid PC port. I wonder if the three racers added from PC gaming franchises are there to reassure us that Sega isn't short-changing the PC versions of their games anymore.If you've ever enjoyed any kart-style racing game, I can recommend this one without hesitation.

												This game was unexpected. I tried a demo from the previous version on the PS3 and it was great to play with friends but this..this is just AWESOME!As a long time Mario Kart player this ain't a pure clone, it's a superior experience. You have land kart transforming into air and water machines on every track, you have super funny ""Capture The Chao"" games or Battle Arena ones, there's even a Boost Race mode.The characters are well designed and there's a lot of interesting cameos(Wreck-it Ralph and Team Fortress among others), the tracks are amazing and the graphic and light effects are just awesome.I was expecting a bad console porting too but the game just feels fluid and great.Sure, it's better played with a gamepad but once you learn the basic controls even playing with the default keyboard layout feels right and you never have the feeling you're not in control of your kart.Definitely a big big surprise I'd reccomend to everyone, playing with 2 other friends already makes it 100 times more awesome!The single player is good too and it's necessary to unlock tracks(which you unlock anyway if you play with a friend who owns it) and characters but I'd still reccomend to get it if you have friends to play with.VOTE: 8.5/10			"

												I think that Sonic has had a shaky start with racing games.  Sonic Drift, Sonic R, Riders, and even the previous All Stars racer.  But Transformed is the sonic racer that REALLY defines not only what a Sonic racing game should be, but what should a solid arcade racer is.  Transformed is more of an arcade racer in the vein of classic titles like Daytona USA, OutRun, etc. than a traditional Kart Racer.  Each vehicle in both air, water, and land has it's own distinct feel and responsiveness that really sets the good from the bad aside.  Transformed benefits from a balanced roster, item-list, great level design (if not a bit long), and great respect to the SEGA Brand outside of the weird addition of Danica Patrick.  Is it worth your time?  Yes.  Is it fun as hell?  Yes.  Is Ryo from Shenmue in?  YES. The best godddamn arcade racer.			"

A variety of players to choose, amazing nintendo-inspired beautiful tracks, three-types of racing in the same game (basically beating the **** out of games based only on that gameplay). You honestly can't ask more from a game of this type. I should also mention that this is a perfect port with no problems like many other games and any gamepad is compatable (no pressure to buy the most expensive gamepad). This will give maany hours of fun and I recommend getting a four-pack whenever you can.			"

												Fun (but often frustrating) racing game. There's your traditional racing mode (more on that below), and the standard arena modes you'd find in most modern racing games, plus capture the flag. The story mode, involving unlocking tracks via gated progression based off of how well you perform in previous races, can be enormously frustrating at times. There are four difficulty settings for each track: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert (which only unlocks after you've beaten the tracks on an easier difficulty first) and each present their own spin on AI. Easy is pretty much a cakewalk, and anyone familiar with the controls should be able to fly through each race. The others, though, are a different story.The AI cheats in this game. A LOT. They are completely shameless about it. Every race, you start dead last in 10th place far behind everyone else, and half of the AI get boost starts on top of that. If you manage to overcome that massive handicap, you'll also have to deal with conspiring AI (they will always opt to fire their skills at you instead of other AI if possible), immediate & flawless reaction times, and to top it all off, one bot each race will basically be Wonder Woman. They're substantially harder, faster, better, stronger than all the other bots. Beating this game on Hard boils down to first managing to fly past the other 8 bots without any of them ever getting a good ability hit on you (if you do, you might as well restart the race) and then duking it out with the Alpha bot of the pack and hope that you get All Star before he/she does. I haven't even tried to get past the first race of the first zone on Expert -- the bots will utilize every map exploit, corner trick, and power-up to completely ♥♥♥♥ you over. I'm sticking to my theory that this is a difficulty reserved for the sole purpose of derisively taunting your racing skills. Overall impressions: It might be worth a pickup at $20 if you enjoy racing games. At $5, it's probably worth getting just for the menagerie of characters. Just be prepared for your robot overlords.

												Easily one of, if not the best, kart racers I've ever played. The game is a huge love letter to Sega and its various franchises, with characters and stages from games like Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, Skies of Arcadia, and many more. Even if you don't have any love for Sega, though, it's still worth picking this game up. The tracks are all huge and well-designed, with each lap changing the course in some way. The transformation gimmick works out really well and makes the tracks that much more interesting. It's also incredibly well balanced. All of the racers feel unique enough for you to find somebody you like, and none of the items are overly dickish. They're all dodgeable, and the game rewards you for dealing with them effectively. The only close equivalent to the blue shell is 100% dodgeable, and in fact is easy to dodge. The game is just overall an incredibly fun and enjoyable experience, and it's super well optimized for PC. It's worth basically whatever price people ask for it.I cannot recommend this game enough. If you like Kart racers and/or Sega at all, you owe it to yourself to try this amazing game.			"

												I mentally associate Sonic games in this era to be sub-standard reproductions of the Sega heyday of the 1990's which pander to widespread nostalgia. But this game is really good. Like, as good as the modern iteration of Mario Kart good. The environmental graphics and animations in particular are phenomenal and transition from ground to air chases is seamless and thrilling. There's a huge number of characters are available and a lot of them are weird, but hey, this is made by Japan. Another odd feature of this game is that the interface is narrated: select anything and it will speak what you selected aloud, as if it was made for blind people. Sonic All-Stars Racing is filled with quirks but is a lot of fun where it counts: the thrill of racing, especially with friends in local multiplayer.			"

Works absolutely perfectly with my XBox 360 controller hooked up.Multiple race modes, about 20 great tracks [huge variety + additional mirrored tracks can be unlocked too]. Very fast paced, and nice long tracks. Big variety of land/sea/air areas on most of the tracks, and some laps will change path patterns so it keeps you on your toes.It may be an older game, but it's still one of my favorites.

												Coming from a long history of playing Mario Kart, this game is refreshingly similar but includes some distinctive features. For once, AI don't finish in the same order in every damn race. Then there is the career mode (one by one vs. cups of 4) and the unlocking through progress. Last but not least there are similarities such as drifting (snake technique?).The biggest feature - the transformation into ships and planes - goes along with a change in physics and balancing which is great.Overall, the single player is much less frustrating than expected. There are so many different race modes! Time Attacks, Ring Races, Drift Challenges, Speed Challenges, races without weapons... From what I can see, this is the best Mario Kart availalble for PC and it might even beat it on any platform because of the track variety and different race modes.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (SART) is a sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (SSAR), an arcade kart racing game that includes many characters and tracks from Sega titles, this one made by Sumo and released on PC in 2013. So yep, racing around competively, drifting and picking up random weapons to use on opponents.It also got Xbox 360, PS3, WiiU, PSVita and 3DS versions as far as I am aware. And PC version actually got a bunch of exclusive characters (and exclusive DLC), like General Winter. Other versions weren't strangers to cameos from non-Sega franchises either. Though the only ones you miss are Avatar-using racers from Xbox 360 and WiiU. So be happy, you probably got the best version.It also had a ""bonus edition"" version for consoles which included Metal Sonic, OutRun stage and bonus stickers. It then became the first DLC.Multiplayer seems to be slightly alive. It's hard to say without server browser, it's only matchmaking. At least at my European evening I got into racing match with 6 more players, so it must be quite good, even though I didn't get into any others. Just once. Maybe just a small bunch of people playing. Maybe none in other modes other than race.Eh, actually that sounds pretty bad. But hey, some say that Matchmaking is tied to region that you set in your Steam download. Worst idea ever.I think that you can play in local multiplayer, where you can actually beat some single-player missions with friend. I heard. Didn't check yet.Original Racing was a simple kart game for it's time, most notably for being on PC and for having Sega fan-service. And fun. It was easy to learn and easy to master.Transformed on other hands was THE thing at the time of release. The transforming aspect gave a new twist for the genre and the boost mechanic was much more complex. It was was objectively outdoing Mario Kart at the time of release. Even though I didn't play Kart. Must be Mario Andretti Racing spin-off game. Anyway, it's now hard to learn and harder to master too, delighting more hardcore gaming and fans of Sega racing games.And well, because of transformation, cars that characters drive were standarized, no more separation into bikes, cars and flying cars.Transforming now divides racing into three sections: Air, Land and Water. It controls almost same on Land, but now boost mechanics were improved. You now can quickly change directions while drifting and keep building up the boost, even though the current progress to the next boost level will be reset. And this time it will be unwise to try to build boost on a straight road. Not only that, but boosts can be combined with each other. Riding over boosting arrows, using boost powerup and releasing drift boost in same time as they are active will give you a huge boost points. You can also do rolling/flipping while in air to get boost when you land.And well, that's why you need a gamepad.Sea sections are similar, though they are a bit more slippery. Actually, it has water physics, so if you are good, you may even figure out on which wave/ripple you should roll to get boost.Air section takes you on the fast plane, which has a bit less responsible controls and will take a while to learn. Rolling here will slow you down, BUT you can get a risk boost this way if you rolled away from collision with some objects, like columns or wall. Though, it doesn't work on every object, so you will have to learn.Weapons were changed as well to make it feel more fair. They look weird, yet more inspired. If it's something auto-aiming then you can dodge it by boosting in the right moment. It has unique anti-first-place weapon that doesn't feel cheap. It creates a swarm of bees Badnicks in front of a racers for a while between which you have to dodge. But then, good players who are way ahead of main mass will remain unchallenged if they know how to dodge that, while main mass it busy punching each other, so to say.But we all know what is the most important question that we must ask. Does this jolly Sega racing all-star game have Segata Sanshiro?No, it doesn't.BUT it has Joe Mushashi who is about as cool!AND it has Shinobi stage. AND yesssssss, it comes with Shinobi 3 music track, which is the best character out of all that racing karts ever had!I am so sorry Segata Sanshiro, but as much as I love Saturn, Idaten is still my favourite waifu.And yes, Sega fan-service is great in this one. Less focused on Sonic franchise, as lovely as that one is, and with more of classic Sega. And cameos. Like characters from RTS games on PC that Sega is currently publishing. Hooray and oora for General Winter and his drifting tank. And even not-related characters made cameo, like Ralph. Or Danica Patrick, which didn't seem out of place because I was thinking that it must be reference to either Monaco GP or Virtua Racing. But nope, NASCAR. And I mean, you know that this is some seriously awesome AAA Racing game when even Valve would come along and beg for their Team Fortress character to be in Sonic Racing Transformed game instead of another way around, so their Team Fortress 2 game will get some recognition from Sega players. Even though most players feel weird over different voice actors.Anyway, character selection is great and mighty. They are quite balanced around in stats, not being different otherwise, though community still divides them into different tier. And characters with low-speed will struggle on stages with more straight design. But if you like character but not stats, then you can just keep playing and then unlock mods as you level up, which usually take one point from one stat and give to another one. Also, unique All-Star powers for each character became simpler and more mundane, mostly to balance them out and make them more fair and standartized in multiplayer, I guess.  Since they weren't usable in multiplayer in original. Still, less fun. But hey, look, there is Gillius Thunderhead right behind you!Just a bit less than half of a characters will be locked away and must be unlocked by playing World Tour, beating stages, which give different amount of stars depending on difficulty, and then getting enough to be able to get new characters. It does give you reason to play the nice single-player campaign of sorts, which keeps giving different missions and tracks. Instead of shopping based on coins you get in each race like in original. It also means that most players will never get to play as Eggman or Gillius Thunderhead, as to get those, you must play at harder difficulty. And AI is already hard challenging nasties. But fun.Stages are awesome and fan-servicy as well. Less Sonic too. More of random awesome. I mean, it has freaking Burning Rangers stage! And After Burner! And... You get it. Not only that, but some tracks also change layouts for each lap, like a ground gets destroyed and from now on you are flying in this part.But really, this is some AAA Kart Racing game on Steam, can't go wrong with it. It will keep you busy for a while. And even happy, because Sega magic!			"

												Got this from the humble Sega bundle recently, originally for (hoping for, and later on became true) Sonic Generations. I have always liked racing games in general and the Mario Kart series. I went into this game not expecting much... boy was I wrong.Being honest, at first, I couldn't see how this game was good despite hearing that it was. The drifting felt strange as a Mario Kart player. The speed boosts obtained didn't seem very significant. I couldn't beat the 2nd hardest difficulty for my first session or so in the game... and this was early on in the ""world tour"" mode.Then, I tried time attack for the first time. I was initially disappointed by how you were only able to do one of the three laps in a normal race; I wanted to run the full 3 laps. However, in the end, I've come to accept it as okay.Anyway, I saw one of the top ghosts going unbelievably fast (to this very moment, I feel mostly certain about it being a cheat of sorts). So I tried getting better. After easily beating the ""medium"" ghost, I saw the hard ghost as my goal. After some struggling, I beat that, and... an expert ghost comes out. While not nearly as fast as the top lap times, I could not keep up.The game had more things for me to learn than I thought. On top of track layout, there are things like: Switching drift direction mid-chain. Air tricks. Transform boosts. Utilizing the small hops in the terrain/water as a car/boat for an extra trick, while drifting. Risk boosts in a plane. Boost levels beyond the stated 3 from drifting. Using a boost/drift boost to evade the remote control item. Holding drifts or not drifting on certain parts of tracks for more speed than if I let go of a boost. Being able to drift while not holding the accelerator to make tighter turns. Those are the things I learned in my 28 hours according to steam, 20 hours in game time ""journey"". In that order as well.As a fan of racing and going fast, all this was a grand learning experience. The tracks are very good overall; I loved how each lap could (and usually are) a different experience. It's a shame they even brought back 4 old tracks (20 total) from the previous iteration of this game where there's only a car section. Those are by far my least favorite tracks, since they feel so bland and boring.It's also a shame there are only 20 tracks too (1 more if you count DLC I believe). (No I don't count mirror versions). The 16 tracks that nearly all change each lap are amazing to go through the first time. Then, after learning all their intricate details, maximizing your speed in each is great fun. They are all beautiful and fairly colorful. I want more; double that. Sumo entertainment (makers of this game) can make great tracks.That doesn't even touch on the actual game experience as a whole. World Tour, the ""main"" mode features a variety of race types to help get you to understand the game's mechanics. From regular races with items, boost-only races, shooting at a tank, and dumbed down time attack ghosts, there's a lot to go through. You don't even unlock the ability to do the hardest difficulty until you complete most of the mode in the first place. This is a mostly good thing to me at least. I definitely would not have had any chance of winning had I not learned from struggling with the 2nd hardest difficulty.You unlock nearly all characters from World Tour mode as well. For a grand total of 23 (no DLC), each feels similar enough as a whole, but each one really does have slightly different characteristics... even if 2 characters stats are the same. As you use each character, they can ""level up"" to obtain mods, which alter their stats a bit. The best ones, especially when you play the game seriously, are locked behind obtaining the max level and/or progressing in World Tour though. You likely won't set great time attack records without them. This is a mostly good thing, but I feel the unlocks for the best mods should not always have been last.Then there's your standard grand prix mode. Since I completed the vast majority of world tour on the hardest difficulty before touching grand prix, grand prix wasn't so bad. However, the computers definitely cheat. You cannot outrun them no matter how fast you are versus the world. They also will throw items at you at bad times in most cases. A lot of the time, you will have to shoot the cpu ahead of you just before crossing the finish line to obtain first place. Mercifully, the AI does seem to have leeway on which one is ""fast"" for the race, so you can still take 1st overall if you just race well.Speaking of items, they're very standard and a lot less powerful than in other games of this type (...well, Mario Kart series). They work in a close/relatively close race, but if one gets far enough ahead, hardly any items will be able to stop  a player from racing as well as they can. Great in single player (not that you'll ever be able to utilize that since they cheat), but multiplayer kind of suffers from it.Multiplayer has some players, but not much. It's not the most fleshed out option. It's also an older game now, so that's expected. It's kind of a slow process overall, but the races run more smoothly than expected even if someone else has a seemingly worse connection. Sadly, the largest race I've been in only consisted of about 6 players. I got into a lobby that was full, only to have the game crash before the race started. While it was fun, it doesn't have much longevity. Now that I am proficient at all tracks, skill/track knowledge makes a rather large difference in how well you do online. As mentioned previously, only a couple items, if that, can affect a far-ahead front runner. With a large enough lead, the leader will most likely keep extending it if racers behind don't have the skill to keep/catch up.The only truly negative aspect of this game, if that, would be some silly achievements. Having 4 people play locally is out of the question, given the lack of controllers/keyboards/usb ports. Investing more money just for that would be silly. Then there's luck based things, like hitting from a long distance. I wish to 100% achievement the game (as I've 101% completed the game), but they really add nothing to the experience.Overall, for how cheap I personally got this game, it's a great purchase with enough surface allure and depth to keep you playing, should you choose to get into it. I would definitely have paid a bit more for it (I'm a cheap gamer nowadays). It's a somewhat old game now, but it's definitely worth your time to check out if you're a fan of racing.			"

												I don't think it's a bold statement if I say that EVERYONE has had fun time with Mario Kart. At least, I know no person who has had no fun with Mario Kart. I had fun, my lil sis had fun, my parents had fun, my grandparents had fun, all my friends had fun. Mario Kart is FUN. And so is... ahem: ""Sonic and Sega All Star Racing TRANSFORMED"", what's in the name ;)Why the comparisson? Well just look at it, it's a race game featuring game characters from other games (sega and valve) you may or may not know and you have powerups and weapons to pick up and use. Is it a bad thing? Not according to me, this is a good game.It's gameplay gimmick is the Transformed part. Most courses are part driven in a car, part in a boat and part flown in an aircraft! This changes the dynamics quite a bit as you have to manouvre in 3d when you fly, boats respond differently, etc. It works really well and the tracks are well designed.It's just a fun arcade racing game with powerups, boosts, skill and cartoony weapons, nothing more to it. It's fun singleplayer, it's fun but tough online, and even more fun when playing with family and friends in split-screen. The characters you can race with may not be known to some players nowadays. I played both Nintendo SNES and Sega Genesis back in the days. I liked mario, off course, but I like Sonic too. I never was part of any camp. Now Sega has come to my beloved PC and I was happy to see that speeding blue hedgehog and his friends again, even though they haven't had a good game since Sonic-CD besides these racing games. The first character I chose was the ""green dwarf"" I remembered from the game called ""Golden Axe"", I also know ""that taxi driver"" from Crazy Taxi and the ""monkey"" from Monkeyball. But Sega is more of a PC-publisher nowadays and so we get: A Samurai representing Shogun: Total War, a Roman representing Rome: Total War, a Russian general representing Company of Heroes, ""the football manager"" and 3 of the Team Fortress characters!!! It's an acceptable roster for Steam I would say, it has more potential though. I would love to see an even more PC-specific roster, let Sega think outside their own box even more, they could sell this game even better if they put a Dhovakin as a character in it or Shephard, or Gordon Freeman, or a Kerbal, but it's a fun and diverse roster.The game looks beautifull, nice and sharp with vibrant colors. The sound is also what you would expect, it suits the game. And compliments about the music ingame! Funny thing about the menu's though, first of all everytime you boot the game the voice-over pronounces the entire title of the game and he also narrates the choices you make XDI really recommend this game if you hang out with friends to play videogames. It's more fun when you play together, online multiplayer is fun, the singleplayer is also fun, but on-sofa multiplayer is so much more fun! You do need controllers, something we pc-gamers do not tend to have and if we do, we only tend to have one... these are all obstacles, I know. But if you do physically hang out to play games, this game is highly recommended by me. If you know how to fiddle a little tiny bit and want to spend some time doing it, you can make a working controller out of any android phone. It's a solution, the other solution is to buy more controllers.I would score it 7/10 if you are primarily going to play singleplayer or online, 9/10 if you are going to be playing with family and friends which I highly recommend!

												This game is awesome, but if you hear me playing you may well think it's terrible because it sure makes me hurl a lot of abuse at the screen! Make no mistake, this game is HARD!! You can choose your difficulty for every race, but you need stars to unlock things. I have had no problems unlocking things, but I start out on medium and then try for hard (I think I cleared about 2/3 on hard and left the rest on medium so far). If you're more of an easy-maybe-trying-for-medium kind of player, you may end up stuck or frustrated that you can't unlock additional characters.If you do decide to take the plunge, be sure to visit the steam forum page for this game and take a look at the top pinned topic for some awesome tips. You really need to learn how to boost-start and drift to start getting anywhere in the game for instance. The weapons are imaginative and they're not TOO disruptive (there are no ""I win"" weapons), but they're definitely not useless as I saw one reviewer state. The thing is you need to learn to use them, as everything in this game. The game is really designed to be a challenge in every way.There are definitely things to complain about, drifting feels a bit counterintuitive and I have to repress some automatic behaviours from more realistic games, flying is hard to get used to as well and although the weapons are not too bad you can still be 1st for 2 rounds only to then be hit by 5 weapons in a row and end dead last (although I guess this is sort of inherent to the kart racer genre), just to name a few... but what it comes down to is that I keep coming back, it's very addictive.Unfortunately one big drawback is one that Sega can't help much, and that's that the online multiplayer community just isn't very big (at least not anymore now). I've only tried a few times* but once I got to play a couple rounds before a couple players left and there was just me and 2 seasoned pros that I stood absolutely no chance against, the other time there was no ongoing game at all and after waiting around to see if anyone would join me for 10 minutes or so only one person had and they left again. A big plus though is that there is local multiplayer, so if you have the gamepads or someone doesn't mind using the keyboard you can have a sonic racing party in your livingroom. You may have to dial back your own built up skills though if they havent played before or they wont enjoy your company for long ;-) (since the game really does require some practice).* I feel I should mention, I just tried looking for a matchmaking game again tonight and actually ended up in a nearly full game with people near to my rating, so it might just be a matter of playing at the right times.

												You know how Nintendo keeps making Mario Karts, and how they always add something new to the mix, but it never quite overhauls the base principles? Well, Sonic Racing Transformed does. I bet SEGA took every single complaint ever made about Mario Kart, and worked it into an extremely well made and competative kart racer. The AI isn't made of super rubber, there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t blue shells, the catch-up item is fair, the selection of characters is diverse and entertaining, the transforming mechanic really shakes up the pace and the tracks are a real step up from the last installment. It also feels more like a SEGA all stars homage then just Sonic & co. with some other peeps. You're really in the SEGA universe thanks to the wide representation of series, the music and the online works. That last isn' really SEGA, but contrary to Mario Kart's online, its a step upwards. I'm fueling a 90s console war debate here and I'm loving it. Great game.			"

Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed excels in almost every aspect of the kart racing genre. The drifting feels natural, the tracks are varied, the weapons are interesting and fair, and the boosting mechanics are great fun to exploit. Where it suffers somewhat is in the character selection - Sonic and company are great, but the rest of the roster is padded with significantly less recognizable entries. Overall a well polished kart racer.The games’ mechanics are well thought-out. Everything works well together:* Boosts can be gained from drifting, boost pads, and doing tricks while in mid air. You are rewarded for chaining different types of boosts together, which makes you always on the lookout for trick/drift opportunities.* Weapons are powerful, but they always leave the targeted player with some recourse to deal with them. All automatically tracking weapons can be boosted away from if timed correctly, and nearly all other weapons can be dodged in some way.* Tracks are dynamic and sometimes will change from lap to lap. Tracks generally will have different paths to choose from, each offering either extra boosts, extra trick jumps/drifts, or extra weapon pickups.Kart racing games are often a party game, and this is where Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed might fall short for you. The fact is most people are familiar with Mario Kart. Plumbers, princesses and shells are recognizable to the casual gamer and that familiarity can make a game much easier to get in to. Sonic Racing's monkeys, fireworks and pufferfish aren't as familiar to people, and until a player gets a feel for how the world and the weapons work the well-crafted mechanics will be lost on them.Still, the bottom line is that it feels good to drive your boat/plane/car around; flipping, drifting, boosting and shooting your way to victory. Recommended.			"

When other racing games go only by bikes and go-karts, in S&ASRT you can drive cars, bikes, boats and planes as soon as the environment changes.The game itself is not different from other racing games but it gives you an energic boost when you get into it - all the maps, views, the way the environment goes crazy and the soundtracks.

												Sonic All-Stars RACING TRANSFORMED® is a game you would rightfully assume is about going fast, then going faster. In reality it's a harsh lesson about how the world works and what to expect in the competitive job market. In your quest to go fast and feel the sunshine you will quickly find out others too want to go fast, in fact they want to go faster than you. The problem is if someone is going fast more than you are going fast then you are in fact not going fast so only one person can actually go fast. This creates a situation where much like the race for jobs and the corporate ladder, when you have everyone trying to go fast no one in fact goes fast since you constantly impede each other from going fast.Which is symbolism for the nuclear arms race.I give this game 10 WHY ARE THERE BEES OH GOD THERE'S MORE BEES WHO EVEN MAKES ALL THESE BEES OH GOD THEY'RE ALL OVER MY CAR AND IN MY PANTS AND OH GOD MY EYE WHY GOD WHY Out Of 10.

												It's probably one of the better arcade racers I've played in recent years. I should get to playing it more but I have to be in the right kind of mood to want this kind of game. The game itself is easy to pick up and play but challenging to master. I'd recommend this over the various Mario Kart racers thanks to the competitive aspect that lies somewhat hidden beneath the surface. Not all of the tracks are perfect but most of them are easy on the eyes and varied in a way that one track can have multiple ""environments"" thanks to the different vehicle modes of going from car to airplane to boat. This is my favorite game released from SEGA since Sonic Generations. The learning curve is very good going from lower difficulties up to harder ones and earning those medals prolongs replay ability if you're into that sort of collecting. 10 player online racing also insures that when you're tired of predictability in the racing AI you'll have slightly more unpredictable opponents to go up against. I can't speak from personal experience on that aspect because I've played the game so little and have no confidence in doing well against live opponents. It's like what my old pal Han said, ""Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good against the living? That's something else."" However, I hear numerous reports that the online does work well with only minor latency issues and almost no disconnects. I would like to note that it may be harder to find as many opponents to race on the PC version with the exception of occasional sales that pop up like right now for example.I've heard some say it was ported badly or botched somehow. I never once experienced any issues with this game regarding graphical or control issues though I do use a Sixaxis controller and cannot speak for racing with mouse + keyboard. From my experience you're just asking for trouble when you play racing or fighting games without a gamepad but that's my opinion. It's one of the most stable games I've played in regards to alt+tabbing in and out of with no issues though results may vary depending on your OS.WARNING: The following huge paragraph is basically me attempting to explain and justify why I prefer video game music that sounds ""video game in nature"". Feel free to skip to the paragraph below it if you don't want to read a bunch of my most likely incoherent thoughts.I have to be honest here. I'm not easily impressed by music in most modern games. Usually we end up with some orchestral pieces or stuff that just sounds very unfitting to a video game soundtrack if that make sense. There was a time when you heard video game music and it was instantly recognizable as such mostly because of limitations of the sound chip included in a console/pc engine. For instance, if you never played Mario Galaxy and then listened to most of the OST you would probably assume it was just a piece made by some contemporary orchestra. So I think what SEGA does right in their Sonic games is they include music that sounds very true to what a video game soundtrack used to sound like, except it has been updated with present day technology using instruments and other more advanced techniques and sounds they couldn't have use in the past due to the limitations I mentioned before. I want to re-implore you all that I am in no way suggesting that video game music should never be orchestral or push the limit on what you can use in a video game, I only suggest what I prefer. Maybe I'm biased in that I have nostalgia for those old distinct sounds and I should just get over it and get into the orchestral stuff so I can further my taste. All I know is, some music I hear in video games travels into my auditory system and my brain says to me ""Yes I like this please continue."" I'm not here to say video game music should be a certain way, I know that any music in a video game is automatically ""video game music"" and therefore I can't deny any music used in any video game, even something like CRAZY BUS, is not video game music. All I'm saying is that there is a distinct difference in how video game music is being treated across various mediums and I prefer the route that Sega has taken when compared to say Nintendo and the developers who publish games for Xbox and Playstation. Also, I do want to say that orchestral music does have a place in video games. Let's take Shadow of the Colossus for example on the PS2. This game was definitely something  you played rather than watched yet it's movie-like quality lead to the orchestral score being one of the most fitting elements included. You had these tremendous sounds with drums, violins going to town, flutes and other wind organs just accentuating the excitement. Or at quieter less exciting times they were played slowly and solemnly to convey that feeling of loneliness or majesty of these colossi and the forbidden land that cradled them. So again, it has its place but should this music be everywhere? My opinion is that no it should not. The music should compliment what is happening and meld in some way that it fits appropriately to the style and events taking place.So now that we got that out of the way I want to say that Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has one of the better soundtracks I've heard as of late. It reminds me of that electronic sound present in many older games and very much suits the fast pace racing game play. A lot of it is remixes but with enough twists that I feel they are their own creation with sampling rather than just simple tweaks and added effects. So I can safely say the music is more than solid, I really like it. If you like the music in older sonic games I am confident you will like it as well.Looking back at how much I've written thus far I think it's time to stop because no one will want to finish my ""little"" reccomendation. I think this game is worth a try for just about anyone with the slightest interest in it. I do have to admit the boundaries aren't perfect where often times I think that I can get away with just barely missing the edge of some obstacle or guard rail, and then suddenly I hit a tiny piece of invisible obstacle that was jutting out  just barely. However, this isn't a racing sim so such things are to be expected but still hurt my enjoyment if only slightly. I'd say it's worth the $5 it's on sale for right now but I paid $15 for it awhile ago and I'm still pleased with what I got for my money.			"

												This is my favorite racing game so far.  It is better than all of the fancier-looking (""serious"") racing games I've tried.  My biggest complaints about racing games are usually around controls (either too sensitive and you drift all over, or not sensitive enough, and you can't even make a turn) and/or that the game is just boring.  This game has neither of those issues.  As far as controls go, they feel very responsive and fair, and each character's car handles a little differently, so you can experiement and find one that works best for you.  As for boring, the races all have parts of the course with air/water or other environments to keep you on your toes.  Your vehicle will automatically morph (to a boat or aircraft) and will handle a little differently during these portions.  You also have weapons you can deploy and defend against, sort of like Mario Kart.  Non-competitor enemies will also popup and try to slow your progress, but not in a way that is impossible to avoid.  I definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a good racing game and not too concerned about super-realistic graphics or any sort of pseudo-narrative/campaign mode.			"

												This game is immensely fun! ...but make sure you have a graphics chip that meets the reccomended requirements, and plenty of system RAM too--ideally 4GB or more total. Else you will run into slow loading times, and graphical glitches, some of which make parts of the game unplayable. I know because I have experienced it myself, unfortunately for me I cannot afford a better computer right now. DRIVING, BOATING, PILOTING--all on the same, track? Lots of powerups, shortcuts, tricks, modes, characters, locations. It will take you a long time to complete everything! ONLINE PLAY! This is the closest the PC has gotten to Mario Kart, need I say more?			"

												This game is a must-have for any racing fanatic. While many may think ""Oh it's just a Mario Kart rip-off"", I am here to tell you that this game is so much more behind it's similarity to Mario Kart.If you care to look closer to gameplay of this game and Mario Kart, you'd see that this game is a LOT more skill-related than it is 'shoot-your-way-to-1st-place', which (sorry, Nintendo) is what Mario Kart mainly is. In Mario Kart, if you don't get to first place very early on, you are kinda screwed, unless you happen to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Red Shells. Also, the A.I. is kinda mediocre.In this game, however, since there are 3 different types of vehicles, there are 3 different playstyles, which also means that there are 3 different opportunites to get an edge over your opponent(s). One can be horrible at driving boats while they excell at piloting airplanes, which can be their ticket to the podium or, alternatively, their ticket to the back of the line. Unfortunately, (sorry, getting off-topic here) you cannot gain a 'rivalry' with another character, which makes them try and ram you off the course or target you if you are nearby. This would make the game pretty awesome and a lot more player-influenced. In addition to this game's unique playstyle, there are also some very unique mission types, such as Pursuit, in which you have a health bar and you must destroy a tank with missiles, which is not something you'd expect from SEGA. Just fullof suprises, now, aren't you?Overall, I give this game an 8.7/10, because there are some glitches present that can cause you to come in last (such as hitting a ramp in boat mode and falling out of the track. You do respawn, however, so it is not a major thing) and because some missions are outright ridiculous in their difficulty. Other than these flaws, this game is great all around.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys their classic racing games with a little... twist added to them. (Also because no one has this game and I want to race my friends ;~;)			"

												If you have kids who want to play with you and you are interested in the likes of mario kart then this game is for you, play as a number of characters including wreck it ralph to win the races.    As you race round the tracks your car will transform automatically into a boat or a plane depending on the course, you can pick up powerups to help you win, do tricks which if successful will give you a speed boost and collect stars to use in the slot machine before a race for the chance of a powerup that will last the race. Play single player or split screen multiplayer with the kids or friends, play career mode and unlock more drivers. Everytime you use a car to race it gets xp which unlocks mods for it, fun family entertainment that all ages can enjoy.			"

												Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed is, aside from the lengthy name, possibly the most fun I've had in any racing game so far, and despite it being at least somewhat inspired by Mario Kart it still feels original. From what I've seen so far the community is extremely friendly which is always nice to see and just under 2 years later there are groups still activley playing this game every day. It's packed with charming graphics, incredible track/level design and a soundtrack that feels both fresh and nostalgic. It's also full of replay value and if you ever feel like you're becoming uninterested; just watch a track speedrun on YouTube and before you know it you'll have logged another 3 hours on the game.Final score: ★★★★☆ (4/5)			"

												Got this game for my kids and I'm having as much fun as they are.  This is Mario Kart on some serious steroids.   Pure arcade racing in some pretty imaginative environments.  The PC port has the usual interface hiccups - but the in game action is perfect.  Everything looks crisp and the action is fast.  I do play this title with a controller - as with most racing games this benefit from analog triggers.I had this game for the Wii U - and decided not to keep that console.  Once I saw the PC port, I knew I had to get it.  It was worth the $30 they originally charged for the game.  It was a complete steal at $5. "

It beats Mario Kart in:-Art-Characters-Speed-Tracks-Skill-MusicThings I don't like:- Inability to turn off the menu music but keep the stages';- The annoying announcer telling you what to do every 30 seconds;- Unstable netcode (sometimes);- Unnecessarily long wait times;- Extremely loud splash screen.This didn't keep me from grossing 200+ hours, though.

Most of the characters and scenes in this game I am completely oblivious to, but what I am not oblivious to is that I know a good kart racer when I play one. The mechanics in this game remind me of Diddy Kong Racing with the different dimensions the race happens in except you switch midrace. Simply a great game for the kart racing fan in you even if you werent big on the SEGA franchises.Solid Kart Racer 8 out of 10			"

												So, looking at the screenshots on display, this game looks, being completely honest, like SEGA's attempt at a spin-off crossed with a fanservice. The ideas of transforming into aeroplanes and boats, back into cars are all too good to be true, and levels that change every lap?! Oh my jeebus, shoot me down and call me Valve, and announce Half-Life3! It's just too good to be true, but it is very true. Having played most every Sonic game you can think of (going all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis platform) SEGA definitely had its highs and its lows, but this... this is possibly the best Sonic game in the more recent years, not to mention Kart Racing, AND IT'S A PLATFORMER! Who knew a Platformer could be this good?But to the actual game instead of the history then...The mechanics are so fluent, there is very little to want (it would be cool if you would like enter slow-motion and then speed up once the transformation is done though :P) and they all offer a whole new game (literally). If you're strictly good at cars, well, you won't get very far with higher AIs. Aeroplanes and cars couldn't more different, instead of having two controls, (left and right) you now have this whole new demension of up and down and everything imbetween, which means that drifting just got over 9000x more difficult. Don't even get me started on boats (literally, they're so difficult to use!) Driving the boats in this game... what can I say, makes drifting in the air seem like cake. The controls can't even be explained, you just have to buy to find out what I mean.The changing level dynamics of this game are some of the most reinvigorating aspects of any game I've played to date, and there's a good phew of them to play, as well! First lap, you may start with cars, but you may end up entirely on an aquatic level flopping all over the place. So for the first time you play any map, even after that to some extent, it's a new map every time, so if you went left at that one bend, I doubt you'll be able to do that again (on some maps, there are exceptions). And some maps are completely elitist skilled-based. Like, your first 20 times, you won't be able to come in qualifying positions. All in all, this is the kind of game that with it's cartoonyness (if that's a word... well NOW IT IS!) and it's zealous mechanics, really does restore hope in a gaming community that is majoritively starting to become dark and gloomy. This is the kind of game that you sit down, have fun and ♥♥♥♥ around on for hour and hours, Hell I've only had the game for a few days, and I have this much to say about it! I would love to see some better server systems though, as lag-outs and DxCs happen all far too often.If you want anything more, like a number rating; ⓴/⓴Anything more? Oh come on, please, to put it bluntly, if you don't get this game, you're missing out on the Amnesia of Scary games, the Skyrim of Free-roam, the Kingdom Hearts of Stories, the Disney of Tales, the Dragon Ball Z of action, the Legend of Zelda of Experiences, the Mario of 8-bit, the Minecraft of creativity, the GMOD of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around...

The campaign is filled with other types of races and time trial-type races, which make the game more interesting. The tracks are amazing, changing their structure after each lap. The transformation aspect of this game is very unique and pulled off very well. This is a great racing game.			"

												To be honest, I was gifted this game by a friend so I didn't spend any money on it, however... It is worth the price that it is now.The game, although filled to the brim with unrecognizable characters besides Sonic and his Friends, TF2, and Wreck-It Ralph (For me), is still fun whether or not you know who the characters are. Each character has different stats and different animations and it's always fun to try out new characters. You can also go through blue rings in order to transform and your vehicle can either transform from a car to a boat to a plane whenever you pass through them, hence why this is ""Transformed"". It's fun and kind of reminds me of Mario Kart except each stage feels unique and different, including several stages from different Sega games such as Sonic The Hedgehog, Golden-Axe, etc.DLC is pretty cool too, the best one would have to be the Metal Sonic DLC for me because Metal Sonic has to be one of my favorite villains in Sonic The Hedgehog. It includes Metal Sonic of course and a stage called Outrun which is pretty nice. Did I mention it's the cheapest DLC of the 3? ;)Yogscast would probably have to be my least favorite one, I know it's for charity, but if they really wanted to use an internet celebrity, I think they should have done the Angry Video Game Nerd, would have really liked to see some F-Bombs drop on Sonic while he's racing against him.All in all 9/10 as a racing game for me, this is probably one of the best celebrity racing games I've ever played, although the celebrities are not very recognizable if you haven't played their respected games, you can still appreciate the gameplay and who knows, it could even get you interested in their games and you could find a new one to play :P			"

												Very fun kart racing game. The single player is pretty fun, but playing muliplayer with your friends is awesome. There are 30 different characters in game, in with a different standard style of driving. Each racer has 6 skills - Speed, Acceleration, Handling, Boost, and All-Star. As you level up your racers you unlock mods which change how those skills are spread out. The different tracks and gamemodes can call for a different setup, so you can usually use your favorite racer with a different mod. (And of course Football Manager is the best racer :D )The tracks are based on old Sega game, and most of them change throughout the 3 laps. There are also sections where you transform into a boat or a plane. There are a few different game modes - SP has a World Tour, a Grand Prix, and single race modes. For MP there are:Standard Race - Race for the top position while utilizing power ups.Battle Arena - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Battle Race - Fight to survive using power ups. All players start with three hits. Once all off their hit points are gone, they are out. The last surviving player wins.Capture The Chao - A Chao balloon and a capture point spawn in random spots. Bringing the Chao balloon to the capture point adds to the players score. Reaching the target limit or capturing the most before time runs out declares the winner.Boost Race - Race for the top position. There are no items to make use of, only boost pads will help racers in this mode.The boost race isn't that much fun, as using powerups to slow or stun your opponents is the best part of playing a kart game.  The other modes are all very fun though. This is definitely worth picking up during a Steam sale, and if you like kart or racing games $20 isn't bad either.			"

												Love this game... My wife and I race each other each night (she usually kicks my butt) on the PS3 - we love playing battle race mode against each other.The Steam PC version has even more racers. Works absolutely perfectly with my XBox 360 controller hooked up.Multiple race modes, about 20 great tracks [huge variety + additional mirrored tracks can be unlocked too]. Very fast paced, and nice long tracks. Big variety of land/sea/air areas on most of the tracks, and some laps will change path patterns so it keeps you on your toes.It may be an older game, but it's still one of my favorites. Love the variety of race characters that span across so many games. I highly recommend Sonic Transformed All Star Racing for anyone looking for some comical fun racing, either single or multiplayer. Definite thumbs up! :o)			"

												I mentally associate Sonic games in this era to be sub-standard reproductions of the Sega heyday of the 1990's which pander to widespread nostalgia. But this game is really good. Like, as good as the modern iteration of Mario Kart good. The environmental graphics and animations in particular are phenomenal and transition from ground to air chases is seamless and thrilling. There's a huge number of characters are available and a lot of them are weird, but hey, this is made by Japan. Another odd feature of this game is that the interface is narrated: select anything and it will speak what you selected aloud, as if it was made for blind people. Sonic All-Stars Racing is filled with quirks but is a lot of fun where it counts: the thrill of racing, especially with friends in local multiplayer.			"

												Coming from a long history of playing Mario Kart, this game is refreshingly similar but includes some distinctive features. For once, AI don't finish in the same order in every damn race. Then there is the career mode (one by one vs. cups of 4) and the unlocking through progress. Last but not least there are similarities such as drifting (snake technique?).The biggest feature - the transformation into ships and planes - goes along with a change in physics and balancing which is great.Overall, the single player is much less frustrating than expected. There are so many different race modes! Time Attacks, Ring Races, Drift Challenges, Speed Challenges, races without weapons... From what I can see, this is the best Mario Kart availalble for PC and it might even beat it on any platform because of the track variety and different race modes.			"

												It's the closest thing to playing Mario Kart on a PC and it has enough bells and whistles to make it an excellent game in its own right. SEGA has a rich history and they have transformed that into a heap of excellent stages. Level design is inspired, with many a stage transforming throughout the race - the final lap is often very different to the first lap. Performance on my PC was excellent. I played in at 4k @ 60 fps using a GTX980. Never experienced any slowdown. An easy recommend for anyone who enjoys cart racing games. I'd be shocked if anyone who loved Mario Kart didn't also have a heap of fun playing this game.			"

												As a big fan of the SMK (Mario Kart) series and hearing a lot about this game, I finally decided to give it a go and dropped some money on it.  I chose the PC version over the Wii U version (my second choice - and may still pick it up for Wii U) because of the larger character roster and DLC.  Note that I haven't picked up any DLC - yet.Difficulty notwithstanding (I feel the game is pretty easy, even on hard), the game is a lot of fun!  Unlike Mario Kart, there are very few OP weapons, and there are no weapons that will hunt you mercilessly if you're in 1st.  As a matter of fact, it's possible to evade almost all weapons thrown or shot at you, given enough skill, which is a plus for me.  The stages are well-designed, the big point-earner being that all the stages change from lap to lap, sometimes significantly.  The stage changes result in your character changing the vehicle they're racing in on-the-fly, which brings us to a more contentious part of the game: flying and motorboating.  Although I find that a higher Handling for your character results in a more controlled flight (I personally love flying in this game, though many weapons become harder to use - there is a bit of auto-aiming provided, though), I don't get the same kind of responsive control when on the water.  Unfortunately, I feel the water physics is pretty mediocre at best, and this especially rings true on certain stages where you're on the water for most of the race.  Sega definitely invested more in flying mechanics and racing on the ground.Finally, the character selection is very diverse, with famous Sega mascots all appearing, some old-school characters that haven't seen the light of day in a long time (looking at you, Alex Kidd!), and for the PC version, PC-specific characters, such as the Spy/Pyro/Heavy trio from Team Fortress 2.  The only character that I felt was kinda just forced in was Wreck-It Ralph, who isn't a Sega character and doesn't have any games on the PC.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, though I feel it is a bit on the easy side.  Is it worth the 20 bucks?  I'd say so, though if you find it on sale, scoop it up immediately!			"

												If you had told me, ""Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed will be the best Mario Kart game ever made,"" before release, I would have called you a liar and a fraud. But, you'd've been right. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is pretty much the best kart racer on PC, if not ever. It's very much like Mario Kart with a mix of Diddy Kong Racing in there for good measure, but it seems to be built on a staple of actual skill-based racing. Unlike some of its competing series, it is possibly to win on sheer capability alone, instead of luck (and peer misfortune). Combined with a slick sense of speed and a charmingly diverse roster of Sega ""all-stars,"" it comes out as one of the bigger advances in kart racing since the genre's conception.			"

												3D racing games have generally been divided into two broad categories. First you have simulation racers, games that aim for “realism” with physics and car handling that could ostensibly make sense in our own world. Some appeal to the respected F1 aficionado, some exist as a cost-effective way for guys to pretend they have artificial access to the all the hot name-brand cars of feverish adolescent dreams. Which brings us to the other category of racing games: the arcade racer, or simply the ones that are fun: Mario Kart, F-Zero, Outrun, Burnout, and the Need For Speed series in its prime. Zip and zoom through colorful, futuristic fantasy courses, abuse fat plumbers and perpetually-90's cartoon animals with goofy weaponry, safely crash and power drift until the finish line. The brand of car you use to do so doesn’t matter. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a car at all as long as the action is beautiful.  Developed by Sumo Digital, Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed is an arcade racer that captures the spirit of the genre, its twists and turns throughout the decades, while simultaneously paying homage to Sega's better days. It borrows concepts from its forebearers and manages to improve upon them or make the formula fresh again, against the odds. The A to B routine is thus: hold down accelerate, drift around corners, repeat for a set number of laps quicker than your opponent. SASRT aims to keep your hands and senses focused at every second, no cruise control. As the name of the game should imply, the courses and cars transform: land to air, air to sea, cars become boats and planes. Nintendo 64 classic Diddy Kong Racing attempted a land/air/sea dynamic, but races only allowed one vehicle and terrain at a time. SASRT will throw you from asphalt to water or sky at a brisk pace in any given race. The tracks themselves will often transform on the 2nd and 3rd laps, ensuring that you'll stay aware instead of falling into rigid muscle memory, lap after lap. Item pickups are lifted from the kart racing subgenre that Mario Kart pioneered, but their inclusion balances out the action rather than punishing skilled players. There are no items like the oft-dreaded blue shell from Mario Kart, no items that feel excessively unfair whenever they smack you from front or behind. With enough skill, damage can even be avoided altogether through perfectly executed evasive boosting. What sets this game apart from a mere whimsical kart racer is the sense of speed. Especially on the higher difficulty levels, SASRT approaches F-Zero GX levels of breakneck precision. The vehicles don’t control like silky smooth, marshmallowy sweet go-karts, but rather strange beasts that feel like they need to be wrangled in order to reach the finish line in a decent placing.  Boosting is key to winning against the sometimes brutal AI, a task that can be accomplished in a number of ways. Smart drifting is the most important tool, with each successful maneuver giving a varying amount of boost power. Sumo Digital was also responsible for the console and PC ports of Sega AM2's OutRun 2006 Coast 2 Coast, an arcade game renowned for its drift mechanics. After playing SASRT, it's apparent that Sumo has a keen understanding of that game's framework, the precarious task of coding lovely, frictive momentum into a racing game. They've even managed to keep the fast friction intact during the air race segments, a task I haven't seen accomplished by other games of this ilk (I’m looking at you, Banjo Pilot). Also borrowed from the all-important Mario Kart is the trick system. While later entries in that series allow for simple one-button tricks to be performed off of ramps for a small speed boost, SASRT designates four directional inputs on your second analog stick for accomplishing combos. You can perform backflips, forward flips, side somersaults however many times you think is smart before nailing (or screwing up) the landing. Though it’s not as complex as any trick-focused game like SSX, it’s another element to keep in mind while racing. Arcade racers thrive on a pick-up-and-play mentality and don’t need to have complex fighting game-like button combinations, but SASRT tries to keep more advanced players on their toes. You can even do tricks off the waves and crests in the water, encouraging you to always keep your eyes on the road (whatever form it takes) for ways to get ahead of the competition.Unfortunately, unlike the gameplay itself, not as much holistic attention was paid to the game’s presentation. The game comes close to being a celebration of Sega, a fanboy’s greatest hits stocking stuffer. Yes, there's an unlockable racer that transforms into Dreamcast controller, a vehicle that belches the console’s signature disc-reading grinding noises and home menu bloops. Yes, the first track in the game features a remix medley featuring “You Can Do Anything” from Sonic CD. The song that plays when Beat from Jet Set Radio gets his All-Star power-up is an awesome jam, too. All of these flourishes are nearly negated by the inclusion of NASCAR superstar Danica Patrick. And that box-office neanderthal Wreck-It-Ralph.  And the obligatory PC-only Team Fortress 2 character and some historical-esque characters from the Total War and Company of Heroes series. Once again, I have to compare Sega to its closest analogue as a publisher and a creative brand, its once friendly rival that has survived all these years as Shenmue 3 dies endlessly and Sonic’s arms are dyed blue. Nintendo’s biggest games often have a fetish-like focus on their own history,with constant throwbacks and an internal logic at play within their respective game worlds. The Mario Kart games feel like they exist in a unified world despite all the wildly different locales. Look up a picture of the Lakitu creatures: it makes logical sense that they’re the unionized workers controlling the cameras, starting green lights, fishing out racers from bottomless ditches and lakes. To be fair, SASRT does have the disadvantage (or advantage, depending) of drawing characters from various series under the Sega brand. Nintendo’s Smash Bros series does a similar feat, though the inclusion of non-Nintendo characters and worlds from Mega Man and Sonic makes some kind of sense: there’s a similar demographic of fans and a rich intertwined history behind those iconic characters. Including Danica Patrick in a game like this is as awkward, weird and incongruous as the time Sonic The Hedgehog was forced to kiss a CGI human woman back in 2006.It’s a good thing it doesn’t matter who or what you race as in an arcade racer. If Disney putting Wreck-It-Ralph in this game helped support all the people who crafted this excellent feeling Sega game, then let Mickey Mouse’s warm corporate fingers embrace all of Sega. Life support is an expensive and dear thing, keep that in mind.Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed is more than a Mario Kart clone or a “Mario Kart Killer,” more than a praiseworthy attempt by Sega to “do what Nintendon’t”. For all its blemishes, this is the best game released by Sega in years. Yes, there are many other excellent titles that have proudly worn that old blue and white logo during this past generation. But when I say Sega, I’m talking about the real Sega, a brand that had so many forward-thinking yet simple ideas that exploded into the arcades and our living rooms alike, ones far too unique to make good business sense. A Sega that was more than a corporate publishing vessel for PC strategy games and deceptive blue-hedgehog-hamster-wheels on your mobile phone. A Sega that entranced fans and made its name seem like a colorfully exotic word, a gift from the beyond, rather than the boring truth: a portmanteau of “Service Games.” Just one more quarter in the slot, one more clearance Dreamcast sold for $99, and maybe we could all have a good time for just another year.

												This game is like a Mario Kart for PC. Is that bad? Heck no. In some aspects this is even better than Mario Kart. For example, the circuits change each lap, so you are not driving the same circuit in one race, and that is great.The characters are a bit derp for me. I mean, You have Sonic, Alex Kid, and then you have a Shogun and a Roman soldier.... what? But I don't think that it's something bad, I find them really funny.The game is playable with keyboard with keybinding are pretty bad, but you can change then.

												Why is this so fun? This game should have no right to be this fun. There is list of things in this game that should automatically make it not so fun and enjoyable.1: It's a sonic game2: It's made by SEGA3: It's a sonic game that has characters in it other than Sonic.4: It is made by SEGA5: It's a modern Sonic game made by SEGA6: It's a blatent Mario-Kart cloneAll those things combined should make it the worst game that SEGA has ever produced, but it's not. It's actually extremely fun and addictive like classic Mario Kart games were, the visuals and track designs are gorgeous in detail and faithfulness to all the classic SEGA franchises, especially the after burner stage with the remix of it's godlike stage theme. I cant believe I'm saying this, but All Stars racing is definitely a game worth buying no matter the price, it's a Kart racing game done right.			"

It's installed and I played 1-2 hours (don't get me wrong, I love the new GTA V and I think it's pure awesomeness... but ... but this little...) and in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed I already have 9.2 hours of gameplay (single-player & multi-player).

You can transform into multiple vehicles, do challenging missions to improve upon your driving skills, and face other people to see whos better. The items can be annoying, but its sooooooo easy to climb back to 1st place if you know what your doing.Though this game requires some skill, its fairly easy for any newcomers who just want to race and throw items at eachother.The only downside is how glitchy the game is. Half the time when im in the top 3, I get easily knocked back to 10th thanks to flying in the sky for 30 secs, my car suddenly going the opposite direction and forcing myself to look the right direction, and just glitching through things in general.

												+ Very polished racing game+ Known characters and scenarios from famous SEGA games (and a few characters from games not developed or published by them)+ Great amount of content+ Tracks feel fresh and well elaborated+ Gorgeous graphics+ Smooth and intuitive gameplay+ Arguably, the DLCs seem fair considering how much content the base game offers+ Not as quirky as Mario Kart, but still pretty good (and the only option on PC that comes pretty close to MK)+ Engaging multiplayer (still active after three-four years)- Sounds can be too loud even with the volumes down by 30 levels- The narrator speaks way too much in the menus (arguably in the races as well)- Interface is too simplistic, so it might feel a bit lacking for some players- Could have more characters and tracks from other renowned SEGA franchises such as Phantasy Star, Bayonetta and Golden AxeVerdict: The first Sonic game I played was on the Genesis and it wasn't much. Then I played something someone (or SEGA themselves) released for browsers more than a decade ago. I didn't care for Sonic up until I started playing Phantasy Star Online 2. The fact that SEGA refuses to release PSO2 in the West to instead give us more Sonic games that no one asked for made me get a grudge with it, but then there's the PSO2 anniversary lobby and EQs with songs from Dreamcast Sonic games. If you're reading this and you've played PSO2 around that time, you probably know why this is a reason for me not to like Sonic.Anyway,I still don't like Sonic as a character, but I certainly see it differently as a franchise. I tried ASRT on Android and was very disappointed with it, but I've always had my eyes on the Steam release cos I knew I'd like it better if I played with a controller. It went beyond my expectations, proving to be a very polished racing game with everything I could ask of it and more!			"

I been waiting and wanting to get myself a copy of this game from I heard they were making a part two after all the success the first game received. We reviewed Sonic & Sega All Star Racing two years ago and now its back for round two.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a racing video game developed by Sumo Digital and published by Sega. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the sequel to Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing, the fourth installment in the Sega Superstars series, and the eighth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Do you think the sequel lives up to its predecessor  Let's find out on today's exciting episode of Dragonball Z..........wait wrong show; I mean on today's blog review. Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a mascot-based racing game in which players race against each other using characters from various Sega franchises, although it features many new mechanics and improvements from the last game. The most obvious is that, at certain points in a race, vehicles can alternate between car, boat and plane modes. The car mode handles similarly to the previous game, in which players can earn boost by drifting around corners or performing tricks whilst in the air. Boat mode features true boating physics, requiring players to consider their vehicle's turbulence. They may also be affected by waves made in the water, some of which can be used to leap into the air and perform stunts. Plane mode, the fastest of the three forms, gives players the freedom to move both vertically and horizontally. Like the other modes, players can 'air-drift' around corners to earn boost and can also perform rolls to quickly adjust their position, earning boost for narrowly dodging obstacles. Players alternate between these modes by driving through blue transformation gates. Certain tracks in the game terraform as players proceed through them, offering different play-styles between each lap.What’s Good:Game-play: I must say Sega really listened to the fans and went all out to improve this series and I certainly see it as a worthy competitor to the Mario Kart franchise. With a wide variety of tweaks and subtle game-play enhancements this game certainly has quite the competitive edge to offer. When playing this game it certainly feels like a true race that is determined mostly by skill and not just sheer luck. From the changing track layout to the varying modes of transportation to the subtle handling differences in the varying modes of transport; Sega has offered up a selection of any and everything imaginable to affect a racing game of this wacky and nostalgic nature. Add into that the wide character roster of old and new faces alike and you simply cannot go wrong.Replay Value:With such a wide cast of characters to explore how could you not have replay value? Add to that a variety of race modes and tracks for both single player and multi-player enjoyment and you will be begging for a break. Sega went even further and gave us a leveling system for each character and different car mods to unlock and explore for each of your favorite characters. This is what you call some serious replay value.What’s Bad:Story-line: WHERE IS THE STORY LINE? WHY DO I NOT KNOW HOW THESE CHARACTERS ALL GOT TO THIS DIMENSION? WHAT ARE THEY EVEN RACING FOR? Hell the most important question of them all is why Sonic is even driving a car when he is obviously the fastest participant of this whole racing game? Trolling aside it would have been nice to have a dedicated story-line to help add value to the game and develop more interest in the varying characters. What Should Have Been Added:Pretty much like I said that only main thing I would have wanted to see was a properly fleshed out story to help solidify this game.Final Thoughts:I am definitely glad to see the success this game is receiving and hope that Sega and Sumo Digital continue to make this a worthy addition to the kart racing game genre. especially since its the only kart racing game I know of that has a version for PC which is way easier to get people to play on locally than with a handheld or a console. I hope to see continued variety of character inclusion from the illustrious Sega collection of characters they have at their disposal. "

												Lately it seems that everyone's got their own take on the classic racing game.  Some are no more complex that Pole Position while others claim absolute realism and physics.  The problem is that so many games are either plagued with confusing AI or buggy controls that it ruins the experience.  Others do everything right but constantly have a hand in your wallet for DLC that should have come with the base game.  Sonic isn't that way.  Yes there's some paid DLC but you don't really need it unless you just have to play as your favorite classic gaming icon.  It's an arcade racer and requires a game controller ( Xbox controller) to get the full effect.  You could use the keyboard but that kind of ruins the experience doesn't it.  This game is console port on all counts and suffers all the afflictions that come with it even with the Steam Overlay.For one thing if you want to race against someone in the same room they better be logged into steam and you'll need to be patient as you switch between the game UI and Steam to get them connected.  Nothing is intuitive about it even to a console gamer when you throw the quirks of a PC into the mix.So I must hate it right?  Wrong.Maturity has granted me patience and once the game's quirks were figured out I was having a blast.There's a single player mode that is really just practice.  In it you can unlock new tracks, level and unlock new characters and earn achievements.The tracks themselves are whimsical and as gorgeous as any arcade racer you'be seen with a myriad of racing challenges that include not only the ability to battle your firends with powerups you collect along the way but also race cars, boats planes and spaceships.It's a great casual racer with gorgeous visuals and hours or replayability.  Everything a racer isn't in most racers these days.			"

												If you like Mario Karts, but don't like the hassle of finding your wii controllers, and LOVE the idea of playing multiplayer with your friends on your very own screen, then this is the game for you.One thing I will say, is that it does not like weird monitor resolutions; I have a 27"" UltraWide monitor (2560x1080) and you won't even get to the menu, so I have to run the game in a more ""traditional"" resolution, but that's fine by me.On a positive note, my biggest problem with MK was that I never really knew where to go, but this game not only has MUCH larger indicators of upcoming turns but it also has brightly lit power-ups so you can see them ahead of time and plan your route accordingly.The inability to skip after-race-stats annoys me (I've been known to break things over inescapable cut-scenes) but I still had a blast with my daughter playing.So, plug in your spare 360 controller, load up and invite a friend. :)			"

												I originally had about 56 hours on the Xbox 360 version, so ignore the low hours on Steam:Pros:* Wide array of characters (including Wreck-It Ralph and Pyro/Heavy/Spy)* Runs well on lower end machines (around 40FPS on my Intel HD laptop)* Flawless controller support (recognized my Xbox One controller right off the bat and no issues with it)* Every mode is utilized to unlock characters * More characters than the Xbox 360 version* Addictive online mode * No cheaters/hackers online * Colorful graphics Cons:* In my honest opinion, this game is better with a controller. Maybe it's because of my 56 hours on the 360 I'm more used to it, but I feel the default mapped controls are awkward. * Game can be annoying when searching for an online match, IE you get thrashed in a lobby, so you want to find a new one, game puts you in the exact same lobby you were in before. * Not a true con in itself, but the tracks are supposed to be based off locations found in that game's universe. However, I only recognized Sonic's, Jet Set Radio's and The House of the Dead's track. The others I had no idea what they were from.			"

												I don't usually play racing games, but I got this in the Yogscast charity bundle and gave it a go. This is one of the most fun games I've played in a while, even for those who aren't familiar with most of the Sega characters. I would say All Stars Transformed is better than any of the Mario Kart games in terms of variety of tracks, characters and powerups. The four-player splitscreen on PC is a much appreciated feature. Would definitely recommend to play with friends or solo.			"

												Simply the only viable choice if you want to play a kart racer on the PC. In my opinion, it is much better than any Mario Kart. The drifting mechanics feel amazing, the AI is actually challenging on the highest difficulty, the maps are dynamic and change every lap, and there is tons of single player content (campaign, world cups, time trials with ghosts, unlockables...). Must buy.			"

It's the closest experience you'll get to the MK series on PC and in some cases is even better. The A.I is challenging and fair (no rubber-banding) and it has a lot classic Sega stages fans will enjoy. It's a must buy for those who enjoy cart racers.			"

The comptuers are bloody cheaters and I hope they all perish with a firey death, but don't let that take the joy away from playing this game. There really is no other racing game like it since you transform between 3 different types of vehicles. Overall it is a great game and a joy to play alone or with friends.			"

												I gave this game an unfair shake when I first played it as I thought it controlled weird and I didn't care for a fair amount of the characters and the ones I do care about didn't make the cut (Ristar, Streets of Rage characters, Alien Storm characters etc) but I went back again recently and I apologise for dismissing it so quickly.This game is really damn good, better than some Mario Karts I would say. It has more than enough to hold you over regarding single player content. There's your typical grand prix cups and single races but you also have an ""adventure"" mode where you do different challenges to unlock different things. Some people might not like this and would prefer everything unlocked from the start but this does give you more incentive to play. There's also local multiplayer (which I haven't tried) and online which runs very well. This game is about 3 years old and people are still playing. I'm managing to get into full lobbies. In regards to the port job, this is a port of the 360 version as always but with graphics options and it also runs really well. Some would say this is the best way to play it (much like Gens PC)The only complaints I have are this game did not want to recognise my XB1 controller until I reinstalled the game (you can also use a program called x360ce but it's incredibly fiddly) which is weird as it worked the first time with the controller and again, I personally can't care for many of the characters (The only ones I like are Sonic characters, JSR characters and BD Joe from Crazy Taxi) but that's entirely subjective.If you want a solid, fun kart racer and have no intention of buying a Nintendo console or dusting off a PS1 for CTR, this is easily a great alternative and in some cases, a better one.

												This game is plainly awesome. It haves awesome characters Old-time Sega fans, Hardcore Sega fans, and even PC gamers can, and will recognize.It haves awesome, memorable soundtrack that's respective to the game the track is from.And the exclusive PC characters makes the game yet more fun. The game controls very well, and it's quite addictive and challenging.The game does have some bugs and glitches, but they're not game breaking; like for the WiiU, that NiGHTS is totally unplayable, and almost every Sonic character (Except for Eggman) crashes in Carrier Zone. (This doesn't happen on PC).Also playing Online is kindof a pain because you barely find anyone online, and when you do they're players who cheat the entire race and you barely catch up to them even with the Super Speed mod. So it's better to play with friends.But all and all, this is a must have game. I've had more fun with this game alone than with Mario Kart Double Dash, 7, & 8 together.You should really get this game. It's an underapretiated Sega gem.			"

												Vroom, vroom, here we go! Mario Kart 7!Oops, wrong game and wrong company. Oh hey look, Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing Transformed!Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed (or SART for short) is the fourth installment in the Sonic & SEGA All-Stars series, which began with the mini-game based party game ""Sega Super Stars"". Obviously this game is a sequel to ""Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing"". This game was probably SEGA's response to Mario Kart 7, and they did a pretty good job of copying that game. It has the same 'transforming' concept of Mario Kart 7. In Mario Kart 7, you can turn into a glider, in this game you turn into a plane. In Mario Kart 7, you can turn into a submarine with wheels, in this game you turn into a boat. There are a lot of similarities between this game and Mario Kart 7, but I don't really care. This game does look a lot like a Mario Kart clone, but in all honesty, who gives a crap? This game may look like another Mario Kart clone, but it's a pretty dang good one.The gameplay is what you'd expect from a Mario Kart clone. Here's the entire Mario Kart-clone gameplay concept in a half-nutshell: drift to speed up, be a complete jerk with an overpowered power-up, give someone the Luigi Death Stare, boost like there's no tomorrow, win the race. That's pretty much it, but this game is special though, it's kind of hard to explain what makes this game special, but this game just is.All the characters and tracks are all widespread from different game series that SEGA owns, but in this PC version on Steam you get TF2 as a character, which is pretty cool. The only problem I have the character roster is that HATSUNE MIKU ISIN'T IN THIS GAME!!! WHY SEGA, WHY?!?!?! WE SIGNED THE PETITION BUT YOU WON'T HOLD UP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN YOU DAMN GREEDY PIGS!!! DXIf you have played the grand prix mode or had to select one of the many cups in some other game mode, you'll notice something. Each prix (or cup) has 4 races, but each prix (or cup) has a pattern, here it is: The first, second, and third race has a track with only two of the three vehicle modes, the fourth race has a track where you transform into all 3 modes. Kind of interesting, huh?  So you only get one or two tracks in an entire cup where you turn into a boat, plane, and car all in the same race.Once you master the game, the AI is very easy to defeat. The AI is smart, but not smart enough. Even the S AI (the hardest AI) is easy once you get the hang of it.The World Tour mode is EXTREMELY demanding, the special mini-game races (or whatever they're called) in the game have you do the craziest of things, like in some parts the game makes you race THROUGH TRAFFIC. The most annoying thing about the racing mini-games during the World Tour mode is the frickin' time limit. So you're telling me I have to do all this crazy crap ON A TIME LIMIT?! Time limits are something that could tick off any gamer, but this game takes time limits WAY too far. Time limits in video games never make any sense, but this one takes the confusion and frustration to a whole new level with its dreadfully short time limits. It might take you forever to complete a special race due to the damn time limit.The time limits are not the only thing that makes this game annoying.  The other difficulty blunder in this game is the Time Attack mode. You know what these are, right? Get the best time than anyone else. Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, sure, but um...Time Attack is kind of.....impossible to beat. The Hard AI for the time attack mode is UNSTOPABLE. I've tried countless times to get S rank on one of the tracks but the damn ghost wins every time. Please, Sumo Studios, let me beat your ghost once, ONCE!!!This game also has multiplayer modes, but I've haven't actually played any of them. SRY DUDEZ! Well, that's about it for this game.

												Everyone should play this at least once in their life. - Started it up and played for about 30 mins- Left it for a couple of days- Started it up again- Became addicted- Played it for a few hours straight- Didn't go to bed until extremely late one night because I kept saying to myself, ""Just one more race.""- Hated myself the next morning- And the next few mornings after that10/10.I do wonder why Football Manager thinks it's appropriate to be racing when he's got a team to manage.

												This game deserve a few minutes of reviewing. First of all I'm not a big console fan and I prefer simulation racing game to arcade ones. I enjoyed Mario Kart on the SNES back in the days but the further iterations were just ""meh"" to me because I haven't felt any great improvement over the years. I bought this kart racing game on sale to increase my Steam library and to have a casual game to play with some friends online. I'd never tough I'd get hooked like this. It actually beats Mario Kart in every aspect thanks to it's diversity, freshness and style. The artwork quality is outstanding compared to other arcade PC games and I run at a constant 60fps on a low-midrange card with everything maxed out; it's that well optimized. The gameplay is fast, responsive and the tracks are very diversified. The levels are all themes of different Sega games in history from Sega Master System up to Dreamcast along with some brilliant remastered music. The world tour mode will encourage you in many different competition to unlock every characters and the multiplayer online, or offline up to 4, will keep you playing this little arcade gem for a while.. and come back to it from time to time because there is nothing else like it on PC. If you see this on sale, you have no excuses to overlook it. Thank you Sumo Digital & Sega for the best arcade game I played until now			"

												Playing this game through actually ruined the new Mario Kart 8 for me. That's how good Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is. NIntendo should have been looking at this game for guidance, as it's just such a better experience overrall. I can't reccomend this game enough. Especially this version too, as it looks amazing at 60fps.			"

												At first I thought this was a crappy mario kart ripoff, but I found I was wrong.This game takes the best aspects form mario kart and adds sonic characters and some breath-taking levels.Seriously, these are some of the best levels Ive ever seen in a videogame, the vibes, effects, colors, everything just pops.Make sure you play this at max settings.My only complaint is the flying levels, flying is really awkward, not extremely difficult, but it changes the pace of the race in a bad way. Its also difficult to hit opponents, turn, and its easy to get stuck on various objects.Other than that imagine mario kart 8 on steam with sonic rather than mario.Also they add people from all of segas games, not just sonic. So its more like SSMB x MarioKart.Pretty good, great for local gameplay as well.			"

I wouldnt recommend EVERYbody,hardcore simulator fans won't be fond of this game but though it's a game, EVERYone should try, even if some1 doesnt have experience in kart games. Kart games, yeah the expression is important. Not really arcade racing game but kart game. This is a game where physics is missed so much that even a Need for Speed seems to be rFactor or Race07 xDD :D But of course it's not a disadvantage, physics rulez, it's funny! :D Let's see what advantages and disadvantages this game has!Pros:+ exciting and entertaining gameplay+ lots of good characters to choose from+ bunch of spectacular tracks and nice music+ funny weapons to make your opponents angry+ The absolute lack of physics is funny sometimes+ Great career mod with challenging racesCons:- Issues with multiplayer matchmaking- Some challenges may be frustrating- I liked this game so much that I cant really say lots of bad things about, but surely this game is mainly for those ones who like Sega's and Nintendo's games and their colorful worlds			"

I was not expecting much, but was really amazed with this title. The power turning handles well on a controller. The game handles really well, and the stages are really well built and desined. The desingers here really created a great deal of diversity. Online pairing is just as great (when there are people on,) as offline challenges.  Over all, I would recomedn this title, if for nothing else, to kill time waiting for Mario Kart 9.			"

												Sega, a company who live mostly in our memories. When it comes to talking about our favorite Sega games, you'd be hard pressed to name one game that was released in the past decade. As a test, i asked a few of my friends on Steam what their favorite Sega game of all time is.My best friend said ""Sonic 3"", Streets Of Rage 2 was another game mentioned by a few of my Steam acquaintance as well as Shenmue, but nothing from the past 10 years.Just to give some insight into my history as a gamer, i grew up as a Nintendo gamer. My first console was an NES which i got for Christmas 1991, so it's fair to say, i was a Mario fan from day one.The playground debate over who is better out of Mario and Sonic was always a no brainer to me, because as much as i loved Sonic The Hedgehog (and i did), Super Mario 3 was the game that blew everything else away and completely obliterated the competition.Yes...you couldn't go far wrong with Mario. From 8 bit to 16 bit, from 16 bit to 64 bit, from 64 bit to 128 bit, Nintnedo always seemed to know what direction push Mario in, but with the success of 3D Mario games came similar attempts at 3D adventure games from other companies trying to achieve the same levels of success.Introducing Sonic Adventure, The Dreamcasts answer to Mario 64. The first thing i ever saw of Sonic Adventure was a screen shot in a games magazine, and it blew me away. The graphics looked phenominal and i remember thinking if Sega manages to transfer the same gameplay from 2D Sonic games into 3D, this might be a Mario 64 killer....but little did i know, it would be the start of Segas downfall.In present day 2016, attempts at recreating the Sonic franchise have been many. 3 Sonic Adventure games, Shadow The Hedgehog, Sonic Riders, Sonic And The Secret Rings, Sonic Rivals, Sonic And The Black Knight, Sonic Colours, Sonic Generations......the list goes on, and only sequels to the megadrive series of Sonic games captured a majority of peoples imaginations.With this in mind, I approach every Sonic game with an equal amount of skepticism and trepidation, but when i noticed Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed in a Steam sale, my curiosity got the better of me...and i'm pleased to say, i'm glad it did.You may be wondering ""why begin a review of a Sonic game with a whole spiel about Nintnedo"", and this is why. Sonic & All Stars Racing Transformed is a Mario Kart killer!. Yes, despite the fact Mario Kart games are rated higher and have a wider fan base, i can't help but feel Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed fell victim to the sour taste left in peoples mouths whenever the name ""Sonic"" is mentioned. According to my Steam account, i have put 22 hours into Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. In which time i have 100 percented it, something i never feel an incentive to do when playing a racing game, however, this game is so fun, i didnt want to leave any of it unexplored.Just to state a few reasons why i believe this game is a Mario Kart killer, firstly the track design. Where Mario Kart suffers from repetetive courses that stay the same, courses in Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed changed depending what lap you're on. The first lap might be land based on four wheels, 2nd lap on water and 3rd in the air. Your vehicle transforms to accomodate changes in terrain and is done automatically and with such fluidity that it dosnt distract from what is a consistently smooth exoerience throughout.The power ups are far more balanced and you don't often find yourself dropping from 1st place position to 8th in the blink of an eye just because someone decided to pull a blue shell from their back side.Those are just 2 points which i believe to be factually better than what Mario Kart offers. There are many more aspects of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed which i prefer to Mario Kart, but these are all matters of preference that i don't feel the need to mention, mostly aesthetics and other opinion based aspects.To end this review, i'd just like to say i have over 150 games in my Steam library ranging from RTS to RPGs, from First Person Shooters to Point and Clicks, from Racing games to beat em ups, and Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is the most fun iv'e had thus far.95%			"

												Reminds me of Mario Kart 64 and Diddy Kong racing in a good way. A few of the weapons are overpowered (rather like blue shells), but they do help to guarantee that the same person isn't always winning. The transformation of the courses keeps things interesting. Having to play career mode to unlock levels and characters can be a bit annoying if you just want to race your friends online. Fortunately, racing on a course that a friend has unlocked will also unlock it for you.			"

												9/10, Far exceeded my expectationsI had been thinking about buying this game for a long time and I'm so glad that I did. It far outshines any other casual racing game I have played. Quick rundown of pros and cons:+ Beautiful game. Bright colors, tons of detail in the tracks, lots of stuff going on all the time.+ Controls are responsive and intuitive, fully customizeable+ Big selection of racers and tracks+ Drifting mechanics are top notch+ Car and plane feel perfect+ Racer mods add another dimension of depth to the game, allow you to pick a perfect racer for every scenario+ Game has a healthy level of challenge, accessible for all kinds of players- Capped at 60fps, looks pixelated at higher resolutions (I'm downsampling from 5K resolution on my 1440p monitor to fix this)- AI feels unfair at times, too perfect- Campaign mode can feel repetitive- Bumping other racers is wonky and seems to have random results- Jetski is too slippery and prone to oversteer- About 40% of the cast needs to be unlocked through campaign mode- Shortcuts are of questionable usefulnessOverall the game is incredibly fun and rewarding to play. Most tracks are set up so that you can boost almost continuously from start to finish. If you want to go fast, this is the game for you. Most of my gripes come from having to play through the campaign, where the random elements of the game paired with the perfect AI can cause you to lose races, and therefore waste your time. this can get frustrating quickly, especially in the later levels. Outside of that though, the game is astoundingly solid and one of the most fun games I've played in a long time.			"

												Do you like Mario Kart, but no longer have the patience for proprietary, single-platform titles? As a former Nintendo loyalist in my youth, I now see the light and have a great appreciation for developers who bring quality games to every venue, and this is certainly one such example. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a modern cart-style racing game and you can often find this on sale for next-to-nothing.Great to have in your library if you've got a local co-op gaming den like I do. All else fails, if your guests really aren't into Monaco, Hammerwatch, Gauntlet, FORCED, or any of the other more mindful 4 player co-ops, a mindless game like this will do just the trick.			"

A great kart racing gameIt plays great. You feel a sense of speed and performing drifts and tricks is fun. I have a feeling that some of the people that worked on this game also worked on F-Zero GX. Compared to Mario Kart Wii, the cars control better. (I haven't played Mario Kart 8.)But it has some flaws. The menu has an very annoying announcer, the power-ups aren't that good and the music is not memorable. And although I did say it plays great, the physics can be weird sometimes and the track design questionable. Sometimes a small mistake can mean coming to a full stop and finishing the race close to last.This game can be hard. But in my opinion, that's what makes it great. And to add variety, you also race by airplane and by boat, with the tracks often transforming themselves, It will keep you on your toes.People will instinctively compare this game to Mario Kart. But it's closer to F-Zero and Diddy Kong Racing in terms of gameplay. And that's OK with me.If you're looking for a kart racing game to add to your Steam collection, this is the one.			"

												Tight and responsive controls, huge character and race track roster, well designed skill based offensive and defensive weapons and items, huge replay value and loads of unlockables, online multiplayer that is still alive and excelent sega fan service everywhere make this game one of the best, if not THE best kart racing games ever created.

												A surprisingly coherent racing experience. The AI is genuinely challenging (and not in the typical racing rubberbanding kind of way) and playing online against others is legitimately fun, even when you lose. If you're a fan of Sega franchises and characters, you'll find that you'll likely have one or two characters you'll enjoy racing as. There's even a handful of third party characters that were all crossover promotions. The differences between the characters are all pretty subtle, and the modifications offer a great way to adjust your favorite character(s) to be more in line with your playstyle. Some of the picks for characters are odd (Danica Patrick?) and others are clever.The tracks themselves are interesting, all based on Sega franchises. Unsurprisingly, there's a ton of Sonic-related levels, but lots of other franchises get representation in stage form, as well.My only gripes with the game comes with the learning curve. You'll find that after two or three races, driving and boating sections will become second nature, and it'll take a few more races to learn tricks. The problem comes when you first encounter a track with flying elements. Probably the worst sections of the game, I dread when tracks are chosen that focus on flying because it's clearly the section of the game that was worked on the least, and should have been left out of the game. My guess was that they wanted to go for a Diddy Kong Racing dynamic with this one and couldn't leave flying out. It would have been a far, FAR better game without it.The other modes that aren't racing are half-baked at best and completely unenjoyable at worst. The game's engine is clearly not made for anything other than actual racing, and it shows when you play battle modes or Capture the Chao. You'll want to steer clear of those game modes completely and focus on just racing.Otherwise, the game is a coherent racing experience and is legitimately enjoyable. It's fast paced, and the weapons are fairly easy to utilize (though some require a bit of skill to use effectively). The sense of speed on some tracks is fairly exciting, and it's possible to boost almost constantly on a number of tracks, rewarding skilled players but offering a learning challenge to new players. Highly recommended to support this game in hopes of a sequel that removes the flying aspects.			"

												Awesome. 9/10Nostalgic & classic, yet also very competitive, challenging and has incorporated diverse styles of gameplay within the races. This game is controller friendly and fun for pretty much anybody wanting to have a casual jam session. Great for multiplayer/online gameplay.The different race tracks are beautifully structured and the classic iconic characters fit the themes of their cars so well. The interace has a really classic arcade layout but the frames are well polished. I love the graphics... I don't know how some people could complain about them. This isn't meant to be a realistic driving simulator, it's an SEGA-themed arcade racing game.The composition is a masterpiece. I love the textures and rich lighting that give the game a warm, vibrant and fast paced racing environment.I never thought I would find so much joy in what originally appeared to be too 'childish' for a grown man to play but the game is just awesome. I hope that other manly men with beards still feel manly after playing this game.			"

												7.8 / 10 - Too much water.Pretty fun game, but very broken. When things stay on the screen it becomes unplayable.Ease of access to change the Video Settings and Controls is terrible, I don't know why you can't just change them in-game. It would sure make things a hell of a lot easier, but I'm sure there has to be some reason for it.Decently fun game though, been looking for any racing game really to fill the void and it does it well I guess. Good to play with friends, good gift to give to friends you'd like to play with and mess around. However, I recommend getting it on sale, and having friends to play it with.			"

												Quick factsGood+ Solid port that runs well on many systems and looks good (tip downscale from 4k for better results if your hardware can handle it).+ Customize the stats of your driver to your liking with mods that you unlock just playing as them.+ Responsive controls that reward drifts and air tricks accordingly.+ Good soundtrack with tunes from some of Sega best games.+ Dificulty options for new players and experienced kart game players.+ Multiplayer local play with special mention to the option of the possibility to play the entire campaign cooperatively.+ Online multiplayer modes for up to 10 players per event.* Full Xbox 360 controller support with rumble.Bad- A little barren online community (nowadays)- Some bugs here and there (mostly in the track physics)- Generic items and some derivative courses.- Some form of balance issues.- Ommision of some other good franchises from Sega.One of the best ""karting"" games that exists on PC, and one of the select few that give the Mario Kart series a run for it´s money. The gameplay mechanics reward skill and dedication, even giving the players the options to choose his real favorite character and choosing determined stat presets to set it at their preferred style. The method of controlling your vehicle is a little loose, and the physics act a little wacky from time to time, something that can bother the way up to the podium in the S class difficulty. Also, the online mode doesn´t get many players nowadays, so it´s more likely you end playing only with your friendsGood variation of tracks from classic jewels from Sega like Panzer Dragoon or Burning Rangers, and   the soundtrack sports some great tunes from After Burner, Shinobi and more. Not as stellar as the soundtrack, the item selection is one of the most boring i have seen in a game, but well it´s not THAT broken, like the infamous Mario Kart blue shell. The game is well suited for new and veteran players alike, and more enjoyable with a controller. Solid choice for playing in local mode with splitscreen for up to 4 players.			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is THE kart racing game on PC. The great single-player campaign, tons of online game modes and options, split-screen multiplayer, plus classic SEGA characters and tracks add to the fact that this is the best kart racer that isn't Mario Kart. Sure, there are some odd non-SEGA characters, and no custom music selection like the first game, but every party needs a little bit more racing transformed with the help of SEGA.			"

												This game deserve a few minutes of reviewing. First of all I'm not a big console fan and I prefer simulation racing game to arcade ones. I enjoyed Mario Kart on the SNES back in the days but the further iterations were just ""meh"" to me because I haven't felt any great improvement over the years. I bought this kart racing game on sale to increase my Steam library and to have a casual game to play with some friends online. I'd never tough I'd get hooked like this. It actually beats Mario Kart in every aspect thanks to it's diversity, freshness and style. The artwork quality is outstanding compared to other arcade PC games and I run at a constant 60fps on a low-midrange card with everything maxed out; it's that well optimized. The gameplay is fast, responsive and the tracks are very diversified. The levels are all themes of different Sega games in history from Sega Master System up to Dreamcast along with some brilliant remastered music. The world tour mode will encourage you in many different competition to unlock every characters and the multiplayer online, or offline up to 4, will keep you playing this little arcade gem for a while.. and come back to it from time to time because there is nothing else like it on PC. If you see this on sale, you have no excuses to overlook it. Thank you Sumo Digital & Sega for the best arcade game I played until now			"

												This game is plainly awesome. It haves awesome characters Old-time Sega fans, Hardcore Sega fans, and even PC gamers can, and will recognize.It haves awesome, memorable soundtrack that's respective to the game the track is from.And the exclusive PC characters makes the game yet more fun. The game controls very well, and it's quite addictive and challenging.The game does have some bugs and glitches, but they're not game breaking; like for the WiiU, that NiGHTS is totally unplayable, and almost every Sonic character (Except for Eggman) crashes in Carrier Zone. (This doesn't happen on PC).Also playing Online is kindof a pain because you barely find anyone online, and when you do they're players who cheat the entire race and you barely catch up to them even with the Super Speed mod. So it's better to play with friends.But all and all, this is a must have game. I've had more fun with this game alone than with Mario Kart Double Dash, 7, & 8 together.You should really get this game. It's an underapretiated Sega gem.			"

												Probably one of the best racing games I've played in a long time. Everything is smooth, and flows really well. It's super easy to get the hang of (although I use an Xbox controller). Some controls are iffy and a little annoying, like trying to throw something behind you, but it's not a huge issue. Story mode is just as fun as multiplayer, and it has an impressive roster with plenty of nostalgia from other characters as well as new ones (Wreck-It Ralph is my favourite). Some voice acting is just plain terrible though, like the TF2 character(s). But it's not much to complain about.			"

If you're a fan of Mario Kart or Diddy Kong Racing, you will love this game.Pros:-Controls are fluid and responsive, and landing the perfect drift feels very satisfying.-Graphics are very nice, though not spectacular. Tracks, characters and vehicles are colourful and vibrant.-Great variety when it comes to tracks, characters and gameplay modes. 100% completion will keep you busy for days.-4-player splitscreen, with the game allowing for the use of nearly any USB controller (we even use N64 controllers)!Cons:-Some races are VERY hard on higher difficulty, to the point of feeling cheap. Pretty sure the bots cheat.-No option to disable bots or items in any mode, despite the first game in the series having these options.-Occasional weird collision physics with terrain in some tracks.

												This is the best kart racer you can get right now. I find the controls and physics in this game make much more sense than the most recent Mario Kart, for example. If you remember playing Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64, this game feels very much like a spiritual successor (in the best way).Pros:- Excellent single-player mode with a variety of events (races, drift challenges, and more)- Local co-op for the single-player mode where secondary players and easily join/drop-out between any event- Game rewards you for taking risks and drifting- Game controls are easy to understand but can take some time to master (drifting feels really great)- Tracks are varied, fun and interesting to play, and each has an excellent music trackCons:- Infrequent glitching in particular walls and aerial obsticles such that they can sometimes be quite punishing if you hit them- Playing as a slow character lowers the speed of opponent racers (NPCs) in single-player9/10 - The flaws are minimal and become non-issues as you will need to be very good to beat the game on max difficulty anyway.

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a lot of fun and really improves on its predecessor. The gameplay is smooth and responsive and the races feel action packed. There is a large variety of weapons to thwart your competition and a good variety of brilliantly designed courses. The courses never get boring because a number of them alternate between being ground based, water based and aviation based depending on the lap or course you are on. Different characters start off with and transform into different vehicles suited to the type of race. Each individual character also earns different 'mods' for their vehicles when they level up which alter their stats.  The announcer from the previous game is no longer in it and instead it is just spectated when you are ""owning the race"" or have performed a stunt or attack. The soundtrack is as good and as fitting  as ever with some really well done remixes. You can play with up to four players but playing against the AI also offers up a worthy challenge depending on the chosen difficulty. Playing on a higher difficulty rewards you with more stars which are used to unlock more characters, courses and bonuses.The are only two things that grate on me about this game, one being the inclusion of characters that just don't seem to fit such as 'Danica Patrick' who appeared in the game because she was sponsored by Sega. In my opinion it would have been better to include some more well known characters such as Kazuma from the Yakuza series which was by Sega. On the upside there were a few DLC characters that were added for free. The final annoyance is that I have found the game sometimes crashes to desktop for no apparent reason. This is no reason to not buy the game (because it is a justified purchase that offers a shed load of fun) but it can induce some serious rage when you're in the middle of a race or have just set up a multiplayer session.

												I originally had about 56 hours on the Xbox 360 version, so ignore the low hours on Steam:Pros:* Wide array of characters (including Wreck-It Ralph and Pyro/Heavy/Spy)* Runs well on lower end machines (around 40FPS on my Intel HD laptop)* Flawless controller support (recognized my Xbox One controller right off the bat and no issues with it)* Every mode is utilized to unlock characters * More characters than the Xbox 360 version* Addictive online mode * No cheaters/hackers online * Colorful graphics Cons:* In my honest opinion, this game is better with a controller. Maybe it's because of my 56 hours on the 360 I'm more used to it, but I feel the default mapped controls are awkward. * Game can be annoying when searching for an online match, IE you get thrashed in a lobby, so you want to find a new one, game puts you in the exact same lobby you were in before. * Not a true con in itself, but the tracks are supposed to be based off locations found in that game's universe. However, I only recognized Sonic's, Jet Set Radio's and The House of the Dead's track. The others I had no idea what they were from.			"

												If you like Mario Karts, but don't like the hassle of finding your wii controllers, and LOVE the idea of playing multiplayer with your friends on your very own screen, then this is the game for you.One thing I will say, is that it does not like weird monitor resolutions; I have a 27"" UltraWide monitor (2560x1080) and you won't even get to the menu, so I have to run the game in a more ""traditional"" resolution, but that's fine by me.On a positive note, my biggest problem with MK was that I never really knew where to go, but this game not only has MUCH larger indicators of upcoming turns but it also has brightly lit power-ups so you can see them ahead of time and plan your route accordingly.The inability to skip after-race-stats annoys me (I've been known to break things over inescapable cut-scenes) but I still had a blast with my daughter playing.So, plug in your spare 360 controller, load up and invite a friend. :)			"

												At first I didn't have high hopes for this game as I haven't played a sonic or racing game in years. However, because of the sales I decided to buy it. And it is really a fun game, a ton of things to do and works alright on a non pumped up gaming pc. If you enjoy racing games I strongly advise you buy this.			"

												Simply the only viable choice if you want to play a kart racer on the PC. In my opinion, it is much better than any Mario Kart. The drifting mechanics feel amazing, the AI is actually challenging on the highest difficulty, the maps are dynamic and change every lap, and there is tons of single player content (campaign, world cups, time trials with ghosts, unlockables...). Must buy.			"

												Totally worth it for Mario Kart fans. If you're a fan of the Mario Kart games you'll love this game and may even like it more. It's the closest experience you'll get to the MK series on PC and in some cases is even better. The A.I is challenging and fair (no rubber-banding) and it has a lot classic Sega stages fans will enjoy. It's a must buy for those who enjoy cart racers.			"

The online is fun, especially if you have a enough friends to get together and form a party, matchmaking works well with Steam. The single-player is also surprisingly really great and the various levels of difficulty should be enough to provide a challenge to just about everybody.

Power-ups can and will turn the tide of the race at the last minute, but lucky and/or skilled players can avoid losing their lead that they've maintained since lap one. Nothing feels frustrating.Visually this game feels awesome. Everything is highly detailed. The framerate is consistent. The animation is good.			"

It is not easy to unlock all the characters that available for this game. The musics are good as well.When I purchased this game, I did 3 sessions of gameplay that day. The 3rd session took 4 hours long. I can't deny that I'm addicted to this game. The funny thing is, it is not easy for me to get addicted to a game easily.

												Fantastic game for fans of kart racers. It has quite a high learning curve and is deceptively difficult so don't go into this thinking this will be an easy game. Don't let that put you off though as it is very rewarding improving your racing skills. Every vehicle feels different. I tried getting a couple of my friends who are huge Mario Kart fans to play. They liked the feel of the cars but not of the other vehicles due to unfamiliarity. If you're not willing to give the game a chance due to reasons like that then you won't enjoy it. Stick with it though and you will find a beautiful, and enjoyable racing game and the best alternative to Mario Kart that you will find. The netcode has some problems which does lower enjoyment somewhat but the online matches are still the most enjoyable part of the game. Racing against other players is way more fun than racing the computer. Dare I say that if the game was more polished it may have even taken the Mario Kart crown! Highly recommended!			"

												This game is great fun and probably the most fun I've had with a kart racer since Mario Kart DS. There's  a nice assortment of characters (maybe too much from Sonic), a lot of levels which are pretty much all fantastic (with mirror versions), and the controls are tight. While it's a kart racer, skill plays a large factor and items can only do so much when going up against skilled opponents. My main gripe is that there are some issues which can occur with collision on the tracks, specifically with regards to skyboxes, but these hardly detract from the overall experience and occur infrequently. The graphics are nice, the music is great, and the game just plays very well. This is a great game and I recommend this to anyone interested in racing games or with a love for Sega.			"

												Where Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing was a fun, casual Mario Kart knock off, this latest installment to Sega racing has been transformed (ho ho) into a fairly unique and challenging experience.  Well, as unique as Sega gets these days.  Fun racings.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=acceptable 5=lovedGame design: 4/5  Controls and graphics have been tightened up a lot since the last game, and I didn't think anything was wrong with them then.  I'm not paying attention to the music nearly as much, but that isn't a bad thing.Tone: 4/5  Not nearly as light hearted as the last game, but that suits the changes perfectly.Personal skew: 3/5  Meh.

The 3rd session took 4 hours long. I can't deny that I'm addicted to this game. The funny thing is, it is not easy for me to get addicted to a game easily. So yeah, pretty much this game made the addiction nerve in my body zapped for a reason.I completely recommended this game to all of you who is a fan of racing game. From my opinion, this game deserves a 9/10 rating.Last words, I'm sorry if my english isn't that good. Peace out~! :)			"

												your first reaction might be to assume it's ""mario kart except geared towards losers"" and you might be right because this game is essentially a more exciting and skill-based variant of mario kart. Every item is made to associate actual skill with effect, and there's plenty of ways to play catch-up or otherwise dominate a track, but the sheer head-butting craziness keeps the game from being too simple.rephrasal: yo this ♥♥♥♥ is actually ill as hell and i'd recommend it to literally anyone as THE go-to racing game for PC			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed completely outclasses its predecessor, Sonic & SEGA All-Stars Racing, in every way. This game is amazing, and playing split-screen or online multiplayer with friends is a lot of fun. The character selection, course design and gameplay are some of the best in the genre, and the soundtrack is an absolutely incredible selection of remixed classic tunes, to which you can credit Richard Jacques, also known for his work on Sonic R, Sonic 3D Blast Saturn and Metropolis Street Racer, among many other things.And it's not just a straight console port either! In fact, while this game is great on X360, PS3 and Wii U, the PC version is the definitive version, offering improved textures, resolution and is the only version capable of running in 60fps. The PC exclusive characters leave a lot to be desired though, but their presence doesn't retroactively ruin the game. They're just not a deal-maker over the console editions.If you're sick of Mario Kart, then this is the best Mario Kart killer since Crash Team Racing. It's a game that is truly full of surprises.

I had a lot of fun with the prior game in this series as well. The air and sea gameplay here is often more frustrating than fun, but it's tolerable.

												Fantastic game for fans of kart racers. It has quite a high learning curve and is deceptively difficult so don't go into this thinking this will be an easy game. Don't let that put you off though as it is very rewarding improving your racing skills. Every vehicle feels different. I tried getting a couple of my friends who are huge Mario Kart fans to play. They liked the feel of the cars but not of the other vehicles due to unfamiliarity. If you're not willing to give the game a chance due to reasons like that then you won't enjoy it. Stick with it though and you will find a beautiful, and enjoyable racing game and the best alternative to Mario Kart that you will find. The netcode has some problems which does lower enjoyment somewhat but the online matches are still the most enjoyable part of the game. Racing against other players is way more fun than racing the computer. Dare I say that if the game was more polished it may have even taken the Mario Kart crown! Highly recommended!			"

http://clickbliss.net/post/92637780532/why-i-love-sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed""Sumo Digital have obviously learned something from their time working on the Outrun series, because this has some of the best feeling drift mechanics since the 2006 entry. Essentially a Mario Kart style powerslide mechanic, All Stars simplifies it to a single button press and demands that you master it to properly navigate the course. Basically if you’re not drifting at every opportunity you're doing it wrong. Seriously, the drifts in this game put Initial D to shame. Also, you can drift in a plane. All Stars manages to one up Mario Kart as well by actually being fair. While there are a mass of powerups, each one of them can be countered or avoided with skill, removing the slot machine 8th to 1st overtakes of the Mario Kart series. It also means brutal online competition. Seriously, if you think you can drive just wait until you see the online community. ""			"

												Easily one of the best racing games I've played, not just kart racing! While preventing the alienation of more casual players, the game manages to take the actual racing very seriously. There is an unusually high level of skill required to win in hard mode. It encourages that you learn the tracks and how to navigate them with effecient boosting, or you lose; I personally really enjoyed this!Racing against other experienced players, the items are very fun and I never felt cheated by them! All races can be won by pure skill alone; luck plays a rare factor. This is a welcome change from other popular kart racers, where victory can be determined by fire-and-forget homing attacks that cannot be prevented. Certain items in this game can even be avoided with a well timed boost, air dodge, or obstruction.Many of the stages are way better looking than I'd expect for a game of this type. There is a high level of artistry and aesthetic awareness all throughout. It looks truly fantastic at times!This is easily one of my favorite games graphically and it doesn't hurt it's a tremendous amount of fun to play! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys balanced and atypical racing.I like this game so much, I bought it for: myself, my ex, a friend, and repurchased it once it was released on PC. That should either be a testament to how great this game is, or how poorly I manage my money.The game has also been so cheap as of late, I would simply buy it to experience the visuals alone!			"

As a former Nintendo loyalist in my youth, I now see the light and have a great appreciation for developers who bring quality games to every venue, and this is certainly one such example. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a modern cart-style racing game and you can often find this on sale for next-to-nothing.Great to have in your library if you've got a local co-op gaming den like I do. All else fails, if your guests really aren't into Monaco, Hammerwatch, Gauntlet, FORCED, or any of the other more mindful 4 player co-ops, a mindless game like this will do just the trick.			"

From challenging levels make Rainbow Road look easy to wonderfuly crafted thematic levels such as  Dream Valley, S&ART has a level for every skill level. Character Diversity: Every vehicle and level in S&ART has it's unique style and feel and style. From General Winter's Tank to Shogun's wooden... Chariot, The level of character diversity in S&ART easily surpasses the majority of arcade racing games on the market.The Notable:The Boats and Planes: The addition of boats and planes has opened up many unique opportunies for fun and often whacky levels. However, this is no Skydrift or Hydro Thunder. The boats often feel slow and clunky, and the feeling of being in water is only kept there by the predictable wave effects. The planes are meant to be the fastest and most agile of the vehicles, and yet they feel very bloated and dance through the sky instead of cutting through the air. Drifting is also a very gimicked function on these two modes, and serves as a tie-in feature to keep the feel of the game consistent. Modes that aren't Racing: From 'Capture the Chao' to 'Battle Arena', secondary modes serve as mostly a distraction (albeit an intresting and somewhat fun one) from the core of the game. The fun that one may have is generally very inconsistent as these modes generally rely on utilising one feature of the game over and over again. The Bad:Poorly designed PC Menus: Graphical customisation cannot be done in game, it must be instead configured through an external menu. The placement of the menu items in game are also have a 'console port' feel, with clunky selection menus and awkwardly placed buttons.			"

												Sonic all star racing transform is a great racing game but they had the use of sega characters but th graphics were amazing to me when I start playing it. The controls for the PC are ok to me the maps an the environment were pretty the ability of choosing te way how u want to drive is a good idea the voice acting is ok with me. The online for racing against other players or your friends is kinda fun and addicting to see who gets first place but in all the game is pretty good for racing			"

												When I first saw Reddit singing songs of praise for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed I was skeptical at best. After 21 hours of play time I can say the praise is well deserved. The carts are varied and customisable (leveling up the carts will eventually give you 7 stats mods variants to choose from). Boosting/power sliding is tight and responsive and tracks range from standard cart racing to a mixture land, sea and air which you switch between on the fly.With a roster of 29 characters, the option of 4 player local split screen and full controller support Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed really does hold its own in the cart racing genre.

												Sonic All the Stars Racing Transformed is banana splitrific with its cantolopy power ups and snazrific power ups. The gampics and the graimplay is sonicrific with its banana ruff speed bootes and it Dota 2 like gamestyle. I didnt like the fact that this game gave me a horrible harvy dent rash on my asofolugist but it was worth it. The bacon levels on sonics plane form are extremely low for the orca standerds. Gorden Freeman racing would be my favorite character in this because I can just visualise him with his sexy ♥♥♥ crowbar all up in his hand ready to smack down the rest of the United States. All in all this movie really captured the turn based stratieges of the medevil era and how unicorns do really exist, 8 Beefs out of 9 Beefs.			"

												I usually don't like racing games but this... this is addicting.I mean it's so fun, I don't know half of these guys because I'm not a Sonic/Sega fan but they do seem a charismatic and diverse bunch!The items are straightforward and there aren't much of them, but they're different and easy to use after some practice.The driving requires a good amount of skill between drifting, acrobatics and other stuff that helps you boost your speed.All in all, it's easy to learn, but hard to master.I like the fact that your ""car"" or kart becomes a boat or even a flying jet (!) in certain areas and it's a totally different feeling, like, flying is not a dumbed down version of a car, you go up down whenever you like and the boat is hard to maneuver.I've been having TONS of fun with this battling against friends online or inviting guests like my girlfriend, plugging 2 controllers and playing, you can even combine controllers + keyboard and then go to an online match!Overall, as a guy that doesn't like racing games, I loved this one, probably the first and the last, recommended for parties at your house or just plain fun.

												This game is a solid addition to the ""Kart Racing"" genre. I put kart in quotes because there are no karts in this game. What there are instead are some pretty solid cars, planes and boats that all control and handle how they should do. In this game I never find myself annoyed at the game for how it plays, if something goes wrong usually it's my fault.I also like the difficulty in this game as well, it's not a ""cheap"" difficulty where you are bombarded with special items left right and centre, no. Oponents actually drive pretty well and don't seem to follow a set path but rather make decisions to throw you off.Is this game just another Mario Kart clone? Far from it, it's not even in the same league. I would play this over Mario Kart any day.The music, by English composer Richard Jaques, is pretty damn good. With remixes of some classic Sega tunes and some pretty good original compositions you really cannot go wrong with it. And yes, this is the same man that did the Catchphrase theme song (didn't go where you thought it would did you?)If I did have one complaint however (and this one works in MKs favour) the courses can be very long, almost too long so if you haven't got much time to play a game, this isn't the game for you.

												I'm an N64 kart racer veteran (MK64, DKR, Lego Racers, Penny Racers, etc.), and I daresay this is as good (if not better than) any N64 kart racer I've ever played. Unlike some other games that use rubber bands, you need skill here. The variety of characters, mods, and tracks is above average for this type of game. I've mainly stuck to single-player so far, but it's been a blast. Online play works fine (but I don't have many friends with this game) and split-screen is available, but single player alone is addictive enough that I think I goofed up my trigger finger and damaged my eyes a bit.

												Okay, I know what you're thinking: This is a Sega tie-in cartoon racer that is already a year and a half old. But it's worth it, I promise. S&A-SRT is the best Mario Kart clone you never knew you wanted. Cars feel faster, items are more skill dependant to use (and are not scaled based on position), and tracks are vered and exciting. Control takes some getting used to, but is extremely tight once learned. Also, you can play as Football Manager, whats not to love?			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is THE kart racing game on PC. The great single-player campaign, tons of online game modes and options, split-screen multiplayer, plus classic SEGA characters and tracks add to the fact that this is the best kart racer that isn't Mario Kart. Sure, there are some odd non-SEGA characters, and no custom music selection like the first game, but every party needs a little bit more racing transformed with the help of SEGA.			"

The desingers here really created a great deal of diversity. Online pairing is just as great (when there are people on,) as offline challenges.

												Kind of impossible to not compare this to Mario Kart.Once you get past the questions ""Why the hell is sonic in a car?"", then you'll start having a great time.The rubber banding is almost no where to be seen, which is nice, I feel like I'm really owning some stages.The tracks are well designed and creative which helps to make the game feel fresh every time I want to have another 30 minute session. The local multiplayer is a god send, whenver I have a couple of friends over, we race it out to this fun game. The voice over (the guy who says ""Get ready! Go!"") can get a little too chatty sometimes which leads to small annoyances. The items system is similar to the Mario kart item system, however, it does have some different styles, such as a blowfish, ice attacks, and drones that follow the person in front of you.The delightful Car-Boat-Plane system reminds of Diddy Kong Racing, and the flying parts have some truly beautiful set pieces to race on.It's a great game, a worthy contender to the Mario Kart franchise. 8/10			"

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed for PC is the perfect alternative to Mario Kart of a fun and whacky racing party game, if you don't own a Nintendo console.As a racing game it doesn't have the deepest mechanics, but drifting, braking and reward for skill are all there, so there's nothing to dislike. As a racing party game, it has tons of content! Customization, varied characters, stages and fun powerups... everything you want to have fun with your friends. Online play and a lot of singleplayer content make it a good singleplayer experience.It's graphics are not super great though, but they do the job. It's music is a good selection although it isn't the catchiest. The selection of characters and stages though are kind of... ackward. Ignoring the fact that Wreck-It Ralph, Danica Patrick and Team Fortress are even in this game, the selection of characters from SEGA titles in the end seem weird and don't work all that well together. In comparision to Smash Bros. where all characters fit really well together, this game as a wide and weird array of characters that don't really match. Still, the ammount of SEGA representation is here including Amigo, NiGHTS and tons of Sonic characters, as you'd expect.The system of the track changing and the cars trasforming to planes and boats really is the mechanic that makes this game really stand out. Each vehicle has different yet similar mechanics making it so it's easy and simple for the player to change control schemes, while still making it varied. That being said, perhaps it's a little too similar since the tracks are always the same and the vehicles transform in select sections make it so that it really blends in to the game too much, making this unique mechanic not stand out as much. What I mean is that the tracks don't really take too much advantage of the three forms and doesn't unlock its true potential. You don't have a option most of the time to choose if you take a shortcut for the car or a vertical shorcut with the plane. It's always the same and there isn't too much freedom to transform. Still, it's a pretty neat mechanic and is worth checking out on its own.Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is perfect if you want a racing party game but you don't own a Nintendo console and it's worth checking out even on its own. It's a fun game for sure, but it's not groundbreaking and is not a real replacement to other party games since it's a PC game.Worth checking out.			"

												When you first look at Sonic all stars racing transformed, it seems like nothing more than a generic kart racer staring sonic.  However if you dig deep enough you'll find a much more complex racing system than in most other racing game.  First of all in addition to the karts you also have access to boats and planes for all characters.  This is where the games design shines as often you'll get multiple options of where to go, one where you take the high road in the skies and the other plodding on the ground or in a boat.  Another nice thing is the items which are only there to spice the game up rather than giving sucky players an unfair advantage.  Even the all star move is balanced in a way that it only really helps if you know how to use it.  The game looks amazing when running at max settings though I've noticed some significant issues with fps even when at minimal settings(Though this may just be my computer.  The game does have it's flaws, characters aren't varried that much especially since all star moves are so much more bland compared to the first game, and the leveling up system is dull and tedious beyond words.  Also I highly reccomend you play this using a controller only as playing with the mouse and keyboard sucks so much its not even worth trying.  But this is the definitive version of All stars transformed as it has additional characters with more promised while the console ports are left in the dust.  And since this game has gone on sale a couple of times since it's release there's little excuse not to pick it up.			"

Good for completionists like me!CONS: Vast array of bugs - cars flipping backwards, weird collisions Cheaters race online cheating openly, ruining the fun for everyone and nothing happens to them A few poorly design tracks / sections Some challenges and time trials are WAY too hard, requiring an amount of precision and repetition beyond fun and beyond a simple ""challenge"" "

												It's like mariokart but with Dreamcast/SEGA + some PC characters like tf2 and soccer manager like the trailer shows.There is still people playing multiplayer so nice more people to race is always good, it can be sometimes laggy but if your good enough it won't stop you from winning believe me already hit people then after like 2 seconds they react to the hit still won. xDGameplay is hell a fun , bots can be jerks alot, like instead of shooting in front of them to take out 1st place they will just instead make your life a pain by shooting you instead, and they like to push you out of the map as well just do the same no mercy.

												Sonic : All Stars Racing Transformed is a fantastic take on the arcade racing genre boasting heaps of content and replay-abilty value as well as full controller support for those using game-pads.The maps are both visually and technically beautiful, equipped with dozens of tracks varying in difficultly from simple to advanced providing a user friendly experience for new players. The Transformation mechanics adding new layers to the game, providing the player with the responsibility of learning boat's, planes and cars all handling extremely different yet somehow remaining intuitive making the game that much more entertaining.The game is equipped with a single player career mode as well as a fully-fleshed out matchmaking system. Overall this game is a beautifully fresh take on arcade-racers and I have no doubt future games will be referencing it for years to come as the genre diversifies.			"

												While this is not CTR, it is in fact one of the most balanced kart racing I have ever played. Power-ups can and will turn the tide of the race at the last minute, but lucky and/or skilled players can avoid losing their lead that they've maintained since lap one. Nothing feels frustrating.Visually this game feels awesome. Everything is highly detailed. The framerate is consistent. The animation is good.			"

												  If you like kart racers or fast paced arcade style racing games then this game is for you. In the golden days of quarters and pocket lint kids of all shapes, sizes and attitudes flocked to these ridiculous plastic racing chairs and dueled eachother in virtual races throwing all kinds of ridiculous objects at eachother. Easily the most memorable of these games is Mario Kart, yet this game does something that Mario Kart never did in all of its running. I enjoyed Mario Kart Wii, I loved Mario Kart 64. Yet in comparison to this game, it just doesn't hold a candle to it. This game tests your skill to quickly adapt, the tracks changes dramatically, giving new choke points and challenges to cut off and blast racers from multiple angles. This game practices a lot of the same things Mario Kart has, because its not broke so there's nothing to fix, but they adapt these things into the changes of the tracks flawlessly and it all feels perfect. I'm not the biggest fan of SEGA, except for a few of the non-sonic Dreamcast games. Yet, this game has a charm to it, that may very well make me like Sonic and all other SEGA icons.As a deathly loyal person to Nintendo (may not buy everything they make, but I do trust them as the last legitimate console makers in the world) This game has taken me over Mario Kart, and that says something.

												Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed is a must try if you like kart racers. A great character and stage roster, along with an extensive single-player mode in World Tour with multiple difficulties to give you a challenge. There's tons of unlockables, so this game can last you a long-time. Cons: terrible crash physics that can screw you over badly sometimes, the multiplayer is dying out, and multiplayer can freeze with bad connections. Nontheless, the game is still great and is one of my favorite racing games.			"

Another problem is that it doesnt support three screens, as in it will open with  three screens but freeze on the menu, which i guess I can live with but it is just unfortunate, also there are very few options for different graphics options.

												When I first saw Reddit singing songs of praise for Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed I was skeptical at best. After 21 hours of play time I can say the praise is well deserved. The carts are varied and customisable (leveling up the carts will eventually give you 7 stats mods variants to choose from). Boosting/power sliding is tight and responsive and tracks range from standard cart racing to a mixture land, sea and air which you switch between on the fly.With a roster of 29 characters, the option of 4 player local split screen and full controller support Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed really does hold its own in the cart racing genre.

VERDICT: Buy Now (9.5/10) Completion Time: 10-12 hoursBottom Line: ""It can stand up to just about any cart racer out there. Buy this ASAP.""PROS+Tight controls+Constantly evolving races+Fantastic graphics+Tons of things to do+Replay value CONS-Expert difficulty-One bad courseREVIEWThis is the most fun I have had with a kart racer since Mario Kart 64. This is kart racing at its finest, where you will be driving, boating, and flying a huge cast of SEGA characters through courses that are constantly evolving.Let's start out with the gameplay. The controls are incredibly tight, and racing has never felt more smooth. Similar to Mario Kart, there are orbs scattered throughout the maps that give you special abilities, including shields, extra boosts, and weapons to use against enemies. Each character has their own unique ""All-Star"" move, where you will be taking on more powerful forms such as Golden Sonic to eliminate opponents. Boosts can be achieved by getting a perfect start, performing tricks while airborn, or executing drifts for a certain amount of time. Once you master drifting, racing becomes incredibly fast-paced, and not to mention fun!This game also looks amazing. The levels are huge, with awesome set pieces that you will most likely be interacting with at some point in the race. Most of the courses are bright and alive, and if you are in first place you will be able to see the track transform before your eyes. With every single race, the course changes before the circuit's conclusion, keeping you on your toes and making each contest much more dynamic. Finally, you will get a ton of mileage out of this game (It's a driving pun). There are four offline game modes to conquer, including a career mode, a grand prix mode, time trials, and single races. Career mode involves travelling through a series of events including races, challenges, and boss battles. Completing these events earns you stars that enable you to unlock new characters and advance to different events. Grand Prix mode has you completing four races, with the most successful racer earning the gold, and time trials and single races are pretty self-explanatory. I haven't even mentioned that there is an online mode yet. There is an online mode. There I said it. All of these game modes will keep you occupied for quite a while.I only have a couple complaints. Upon completing the hardest difficulty for the Grand Prix races, an ""Expert"" mode is unlocked which has an unbelievably high difficulty. I don't know if there is just something I haven't figured out yet, but boy do you need to be on your game to even make third. Also, there is one course that I simply did not enjoy at all. I found it incredibly frustrating with many tight corners and jumps that were more of a pain than fun. But these slight annoyances didn't detract from the bigger picture.I honestly think this is one of the best racers out there. It's beautiful, fun, and will keep you coming back for more. I think it can stand up to just about any kart racer out there (I'm looking at you, Mario). Buy this ASAP.			"

												So, when Sonic & All-Stars Racing first came out, everyone pretty much just passed it off as a Mario Kart clone that would never quite make it. But, with this installment, it blows that idea out of the water. This is better than Mario Kart. While it has less in the way of more well-known characters and wacky items, it has its own charm with nostalgic favourites like Beat and Ulala from Sega's classics; alongside representatives from their newer IPs; all the while revelling in cheesy dialogue from them all and a range of dynamic, stunning tracks to race around. It doesn't try to be something so much greater than Mario Kart or similar family racing games; but pulls it off anyway - it's just wild and fun, The fact that rubber-banding effects are really lessened in this game is particularly welcome, although it still has its own type - the All-Star moves; although they are fun in their own way.All in all, highly recommended for anyone who's getting a bit old for Mario Kart or just wants to try something new.

												On a very bored Friday where I failed to attend my college course, I decided that the zany scrapes of Sonic, and his new friends including Team Fortress, Shogun and Football Manager was for me. I installed the game during its free weekend and had no issues installing, the download was fast and despite the relatively small file size, the game had amazing graphics, or at least, as amazing as you can get with hedgehogs and Team Fortress characters.My initial issues with the game included controls, the game is clearly designed for the use of controllers and more customised peripherals, like steering wheels with pedals. You cannot configure the controls or the graphic settings out of game which makes it quite annoying, especially if you're attempting to change your resolution or find out what runs best with your computer set up. When I finally got into the game and began to drive around (as expected, I was Sonic), the game was relatively straight forward, and perhaps I wasn't looking clearly enough but the presence of a tutorial is extremely lacking, and I found myself looking at the control lists to understand what I was doing.The multiple vehicle system was something very unexpected, but not entirely unwelcomed once I had adjusted. The boating system is a little awkward at first, but I eventually found myself enjoying the neat tricks you can perform once you're up in the water. Planes are extremely fun and as expected, driving is an absolute pleasure in this game. It's almost like driving along the higher hills of Scotland or Wales in the late summer.The game is particularly easier than most other driving games, due to the fact you have weapons, and aiming is extremely simple, you can disarm your opponents using balls of ice, fireworks (don't try that at home) or even pufferfish. It makes the game truly dynamic and forces you adapt at every turn, using every skill in your arensal to evade the traps your opponents have set out for you.The levelling system for your characters is extremely benefical, and allows you to customise your loadout depending on the map, this allows us to separate out the good drivers from the great ones, who will adjust their abilities according to their map. For people new to the game, the system helps ease them into customisation of their vehicles, but allows pro-players to efficiently edit their load-outs.If you've got nothing to do this weekend, I highly reccomend this game. It's a fun little timewaster, and even if you don't enjoy racing games, you will find yourself lost in it.10/10 from this Sonic fan!			"
