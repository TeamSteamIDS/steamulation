								Game last updated on April 27 of 2016. Developer last contact on April 28 of 2016, Current playerbase is dead[steamcharts.com]. Although you can play with and against AI.The game is fun, you drive a car (or control a turret) and your objective is to win by either driving or killing (as a turret) your racer's rivals. It remind me of Harms Way for the Xbox 360. However, as the Store Page says, it's in Alpha and is an unfinished product, there are few maps, to unlock some stuff you need to play a lot, and without an active playerbase it gets repetitive quickly, the driving controls need improvement, and most of the updates I remember, were new player models (cars). It still has some issues and with the way its being updated, I don't think it's worth the purchase right now.Do keep in mind it took them 2 years to apply an update that just changed the way turrets could get ammo and the removal of class progression barriers. The last update was on April 27 of 2016 but the in-game version still shows as the November 11 of 2014 one.

								So far from what i have played the game is great, good looking and a great idea, but for me personally the car handling is far from good, there is a lot of work to do in terms of the cars handling, it feels twitching and some delay when making a turns and the drifting feeling really weird, and that's the only thing that worries me at the moment and hopefully further updates up til launch it will be good, though keep in mind this is alpha so this is to be expected, and when they do optimize the handling then this is a really fun game with fun ideas.More info at: http://www.ksalue.com/main/2014/03/game-shock-calibre-10-racing-series/

								Great concept and potentially a great game, but in it's current state the game is not properly playable.  I bought this game on sale.  I had seen it ages ago and it looked good but I noticed the lack of updates so I did not buy it.  But for under £4 I thought 'what the heck' and bought it anyway.  The problem with this game is the lack of updates and the fact it is not properly playable.  The devs need to get their act in order and finish this game because people have paid good money to support it.  I putting a 'no' recommendation for now, but if the game starts getting updates, I will change it to a 'yes'.			"

								Let me just say that I love this game. The mixture of shooting and driving is really something cool, as I'm a racing fan, and i have friends that want to game but don't race.I do have one issue with it, in that there is absolutely no playerbase at the moment. We tested this to see if we could get ourselves up in the leaderboard and no points have shifted for any of the other teams in months.I haven't seen any updates for this game in a long time either. However, if the developers are still working on this and they are going to keep updating it and promoting it, it will be a great game. The idea is there, and I wouldn't stop anyone from purchasing it, but it is much better if you have a partner to be on your team.UPDATE:After months and months, there is still little playerbase and no new updates. I retract my previous review. While this game is fun to play, I feel that the developers have dropped this title and that is unfortunate. Save your money.			"

Avoid this game! Calibre 10 is an abandoned access title. The developers are entirely absent from the forums and haven't updated the game in any way for more than a year and half.The idea was great--4 teams, two per team, one races while the other teammate controls turrets on the track and tries to destroy the other racers. This is the kind of game that relies on players being online, everyone stopped playing once the developers stopped updating the game. The game does have bot support but they aren't very smart, it's a bummer they didn't add local multiplayer.Host an empty online game and play with the bots for an hour or two and you'll have seen everything the game has to offer. Controller support is in race only, you can use the analog stick but it's just mapped to the keyboard arrow controls. When I look at what they had planned and how the game plays it would appear that the game is lacking 90% of the planned content.			"

Early Access Review
								(ALPHA3) This game has potential, but not worth the 19.99$ price tag.....yet  Gameplay is pretty jittery for me (only for a few seconds at start of race) and a few others i asked ingame. car design is pretty good and i am sure will get even better especially if they partner up with steam workshop like they plan to. This game supports controller and keyboard use at the same time, which i happen to like because i can aim better using a mouse in a turret and drive better using a controller. The game eniviroment looks pretty good and even has hazards such as rocks that can damage you. I would like to see weather effects though. One thing that sucks though is car respawn, when a car dies it will respawn in the middle of the track, which wouldnt be bad if it had a no clipping phase to it, but instead you can run right into them and wreck pretty bad.( i know you might say dodge, but i was right on his a$$ the whole game then he died and respawned in a second giving me no time to dodge.) As for sound effects the game is PAR if not sub-par with music and vehicles. still dont have much to say about sound quality. This game also allows single player racing against AI controlled cars, or alone where player can pick turret or car.			"

								Im not a racing fan at all however I saw this game and decided to give it a go. What caught my eye is the guns, ability to blow up your oponent team is a major plus and the reason why I bought the game. I have quite a few ""Alpha / Beta"" Steam games so I am accustomed to unfinished games and would recomend this to anyone who liked racing or blowing s*** up. If you can get the people then the game is great however it seems there is not much of a following at the moment seeing there is never anyone playing it seems. Getting a group going is a long wait but when you do get some people in to join it is alot of fun.			"

								Calibre 10 has all of the ingredients for a very, very entertaining game. It's like Trackmania with turrets, where a gunner and driver are paired together. Four drivers speed down the track included with the Alpha as they race to grab power-ups and avoid gunfire from turrets. The teammates can swap between any available turret locations on the map. Is a turret occupied by an opponent? Take it out and steal it from the enemy. Drivers can grab missile turret upgrades or debuff enemy turrets, as well as grab Nitro and Shield pickups. It's a fairly simplistic formula that keeps things balanced and straightforward. Unfortunately, I could only play against the AI so it's tough to tell how the whole game will pan out. If memory serves me correctly, the Live Arcade had a smiliar entry from the same team. From what I can tell, however, Alpha 1 has a bit of interesting content, a teaser, if you will. If they can iron out some of the loose car handling and reign in turret damage, this could be a fantastic title.			"

Gunners fight over control of turrets to try to shoot down the other racers. Drivers goal is to cross the finish first. Can't wait to see more tracks and such.			"

								This is a racing game that puts a twist on the usual arcade racing style adding turrets to the game to eliminate other racers to put you at first! Basically you and another person team up, one of you in turret and other in car and if you are in turret you try and kill enemy racers and if you are a racer you try and get past the other racers. Beware as it can get repetitive without an active player base. All up fun game but it will never be the best racing game due to a non existent player base. Get it if it goes on sale.			"

								Eh. Nah.The graphics are pretty sweet and the idea is conceptually awesome, and that's about everything good I have to say about the game. There's no real teamwork involved for a game that is 100% co-op (teams of 2v2v2v2) and it just feels really repetitive. I think the fact that there's noone to play with makes it like that, mincing up bots just gets old fast when there isn't a true ""career"" mode. There's just a couple unlocks whicht are fun to get and try, but then you're looking for something else and there is just nothing else there. I pretty much got bored before I even made it to a point in the game where the gunner gets to really play (re: mobile turrets, I'm pretty sure they're a thing, not sure if the feature has even been introduced yet). It's in Alpha so I haven't given up on it yet, as I said I love the concept, but right now I won't be playing it anytime soon.			"

Oh and the SHEER AMOUNT OF CONTENT: 1 map, like 3-4 cars, 3 turret types. I get that it is an alpha... But come on. With a bit more polish, more communication, and actually good connection and PENALTIES FOR QUITTING, it could MAYBE get like a 3/10.			"

A lot of blur to cover the low quality textures on cars, ground etc.           - The way the car handles... ughh, it's worse than a 15 year old game. I can't take a corner. It's simple as that.          - Bugs... I can't go in full screen, game crashed etc. Anway, do I recommend it ? NOT for now... like I said, later I will try again and I recommend to you to do the same: try it later. Now it's just too frustrating.			"
