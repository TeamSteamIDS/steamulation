Early Access Review
Basic InformationTitle:  Nash RacingStatus:  Early AccessDeveloper:  Tero LunkkaPublisher:  Tero LunkkaGenre:  3D RacerRelease Date:  1st of February, 2017Type:  Singleplayer General ImpressionAn Early Access Racer with a lot of issues and equal amount of potential. There aren’t many racing games on Steam using the Unreal Engine 4 and even fewer conventional ones, featuring regular cars powered by internal combustion engines. I’m glad that didn’t stop developer, Tero Lunkka from trying though. He released three games on Steam and Nash Racing is his best so far in terms of scope and attention to details.That isn’t to say that Nash is all polished and ready to be enjoyed. Far from that since calling it “rough around the edges” would be an understatement. I had to contend with resolution issues, frame rate drops and glitches that would be more suited in Goat Simulator than in a 3D Racer that wants to be taken seriously. There is some eye candy present but don’t expect Project Cars level of detail. Instead, appreciate it as the work of a single individual which has shown the talent and ambition to attempt multiple gaming genres so far, instead of calling it quits after his first flop. The Steam indie scene isn’t made up of just success stories as I’m certain you stumbled across several games filled with blatant lies and equally “honest” devs. I’m willing to give Tero, the benefit of doubt in regards to his current Early Access project. I’ll keep an eye on its progress and if all those promises fall flat, I’ll be sure to readjust my review enough for it to reflect the changes or lack thereof, as the case shall present itself.Racing games with vehicle part and color customization options, aren’t a new concept, yet each year less racers seem to offer this kind of freedom. I’m always a fan of adding a personal touch in the games I play so the fact that you can modify to a certain degree, the 4 car model presets currently found in-game, is a big plus for me. Track diversity is also present, along with a fairly convincing damage system but Nash Racing’s single biggest issue stems from its dumber than bricks, Artificial Intelligence. I kid you not, I’ve seen racing AI in smartphone games that seemed like actual simulations compared to Nash. The developer needs to iron out this problem as soon as possible, before focusing on adding more vechicle and racing track options.I have decided to recommend it since I appreciate a decent asking price when I see it. Nash Racing isn’t overpriced at all, taking into consideration all that it offers so far. Dev team still debates if they shall increase the pricing when out of Early Access stage or not, but I advise them to keep this price tag and thus contribute to the fledgling niche for affordable indie racing titles on Steam. They won’t necessarily fill the gap, since demand is always on the rise. But at least I can see a spot for this game as well if the developer plays it smart in the end. Long story short, you can safely purchase Nash Racing already instead of waiting a few more months. Just be prepared to wait a bit for some updates or otherwise you shall have to accept an underwhelming racing experience. Please Tero, add Achievements and Trading Cards ASAP!Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics.+ Decently priced for an Early Access.+ Vehicle customization options.+ Steam Trading CardsWeak Points- Atrocious AI.- Glitches & bugs.- No Steam Achievements.Rating 65/100  This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews, through the generous contribution of Erander♣, the owner of EMMS.

												All in all the game is not that bad. It is at least playable. However I only recomend buying if you really like racing games, otherwise it might not be for you. There are some minor and some major glitches in the game. I feel if the game is further developed it would make it more enjoyable. The game has a lot of room for improvement and is capable to becoming something that caters to a wider range of gamers.

Nash RacingThis game is simply bad and it doesn't deserve being on Steam. I'm refunding it.But if you fix some issues, I will maybe buy it again Pros:Unreal Engine 4Selection of carsDestruction modelAbility to recolor your carConsCamera is not turning when car is turningAI dumb as brick, they drive like they are drunk, they will crash often into environmentPoor optimizationPoor car handling, cars are too slow and they turn too slowlyTracks looks bland and genericGraphic settings doesn't save, so when you changed them, they will revert to defaultFree Roam Open World is cheap copy of Next Car Game, and it just looks too uglyLess fun than free racing games like Stunt Rally or Rally TriggerNo trading cardsPoor graphic for Unreal Engine 4 gamenow the verdict is 2/10If you fix issues pointed above, the game might have some value, but at this point, there is almost none.

Early Access Review
								For an early access game, the game does offer a lot of stuff but the game itself still needs  A LOT MORE WORK! You have a few cars and some customization. Customization is not the best but it could be more upon the full release. The free roam map is just a bunch of assets and structures thrown into a map to show off the terrains and roads on how the car performs, along with testing the damage system. Racing with the Ai is terrible. Ai is too easy to beat and no challenge what so ever. Ragdoll is terrible in game. You can hit a car or an object and will lauch in the air.. The game could be good and promising if done correct but for now wait and see  what happensProsRacing maps and free roam map10 cars in game for nowSound is okayCustomize Lights, front bumper, steering wheel, brake lights, etcGame does have car damageConsNeeds a lot more customizationDamage from vehicles needs more work. Camera needs more workSigns arnt destructibleMost racing maps are just too plainRagdoll is TERRIBLE. I can hit the enemy racer, and my car will go flying in the air doing spins			"

Early Access Review
								In my opinion, this game has a lot of potential. It has great car customization, variety of tracks to choose from, freedom to do anything you want in a free roam section, nice little selection of cars, good handling and beautiful graphics. Also, it's well optimized. Of course, it's an early-access game, so there are some bugs, but overall, it's really worth these 3,99€.My gameplay video -

Early Access Review
								In my opinion, this game has great potential and the developer better not let it go to waste. I can see that the reason he released it into steam this early is to get the funds he needs for the game. Right now in it's current build the cars are great. But on the downside, the cars are mostly the only thing that is great. The AI is ♥♥♥♥ and the maps are ♥♥♥♥, but I am gonna leave this on a positive review for now since the game isn't really that costly and could become something huge if the developer doesnt ruin it.

Early Access Review
								I was not sure is this a game or some rough experiment, but after seeing that this game is no more than a specific unreal asset, that anyone can just buy and release it as it is... https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/advanced-tuning-cars ...Also cars deform like they are from some weird material like wet cardboard or melted plastic or something. Track design is awful, the tracks are all perfectly flat and give you randim frame drops. Car models look great, but only until they take damage. The sound is just awful, and I mean awful and wrong. But despite all these and more falts, alt+F4 works well. I absolutely can't recommend this ""game"" in the state as it is now. It's simply not fun and it certainly does not feel like a game.			"

Early Access Review
								Short answer: Sorry, can't recommend in current state. Game is slow, the interface is bad, the car physics is just silly (you nudge someone on the side and they jump in the air and spin around). This is Early Access, very EARLY ACCESS, and should be put down as Alpha/Concept work in my opinion at this time. Which again leads to my question fo: when should something be at a stage that it should be sold? When should we have a ""limit"" in Steam to show that the game is not fit for purchase at this time if you are wanting a playable game?As you can see from my time - I gave it a good amount of ""faith/hope"" that I was thinking I just sucked as a game player, and maybe it was just me not finding the jem that this was - but each moment of that was painful trying to see if I could ignore the bugs, and defects still in the game.I really hope that with updates the developer will improve, as it is good to have indie racing car games. But for now, I certainly wouldn't recommend this game. At each update I will try again, and if I start seeing improvements in the defects and errors and playablity, I will sure to edit this review to reflect.			"
