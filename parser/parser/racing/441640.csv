												For the first game, is not bad. Respect - lovers of space and science fiction. Procurement Level - The default should be zero. For the victory, the transition to a new track. We are waiting for an upgrade!			"

												Trash. Vehicle breaks within 3 seconds of playing, because i hit a wall once, or someone who started right behind me shoots me instantly.The game had much potential but all is wasted. Completely unplayable.			"

												Non-playable garbage due to extremely clumsy controls. 3/10 for graphics. Could be a nice screensaver if you give the gamepad to a 5-year-old.			"

												Nice physics and flight controls but not much of a racing game unfortunately.  The tracks, if you can even call them that, are pretty bland and unlike something like F zero theres no sense of incredible speed.  Graphics are good for what they accomplish but would have preferred better racing.  Weapon selection is cool though.  I just wish there were more enemies to use them on.  Fzero on nintendo 64 had 50 racers at once.  5/10			"

												The game is barely playable which is a shame as the game engine seems like it could be pretty fun with a bit more tweaking. But unfortunately, despite some promises a while back the devs have been stone quiet for over 6 months. Avoid.			"

												This game is literally unplayable. When the game starts, you are killed immediatelly. No luck after trying to figure out how it works after a longer session.What is more annoying is when you have two monitors, the mouse is moving out from the primary monitor and the game loses focus.AVOID!
