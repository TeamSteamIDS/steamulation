Back Story2008: Bugbear released FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage for PC. It was a remastered verison of FlatOut 2, with some new modes, different soundtrack, and new cars. Bugbear just unknowning released their last FlatOut game.2009: The publisher, Empire Interactive, filed for backrupty, and shutdown. Bugbear lost the Flatout IP, where it then went to another publisher, Strategy First. This publisher hired Team 6 to work on a new FlatOut game.2011: Team 6 released Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction for PC. The game was recieved horribly, with bad AI, bad physics, horrible optimization, lacklust map design, boring gamemodes, and awful car damage. The game was nothing like the original FlatOut games, and became one of the worst games on Steam. 2014: Bugbear released an early access game called Next Car Game (Now known as Wreckfest) to Steam. They said they wanted to go ""back to their roots"" with a ""core FlatOut racing experience"" and a ""tactical damage system"" inspired from the Destruction Derby games. Instead of being the fun game they hoped, it turned into a simulator years later. This means that any ""roots"" they wanted from FlatOut were gone. Fans lost hope that there would ever be a new FlatPOut game.2015: A new game called FlatOut 4: Total Insanity was announced, being made by two new developers, Kylotonn Entertainment and Tiny Rebel Games.2016: Bugbear released another early access game called Stuntfest. This game is based off the stunt ragdoll stunt mode in FlatOut. Instead of making the comsumers happy, it made them mad since they thought the stunt mode was going to be included in Wreckfest.Now it's 2017. FlatOut 4: Total Instanity released for PC. Does it live up to it's predecessors?FlatOut 4: Total Insanity ReviewFlatOut 4 isn't the Bugbear style FlatOut we wanted, but I will say that the game is okay, but not amazing. It has issues that hold back it's potential at restarting the FlatOut series.Optimization/PC SettingsI was a bit disappointed at the lack of settings for graphical changes. I have everything on the highest setting, and the game looks good, but lack luster in some departments. Pop in of props, and shadows are very noticeable. Textures, and particle effects look amazing, although the sparks are too bright, and overexagerated. Some of the images, like with loading screens, are a bit blurry, and pixelated. The game can run over 60 fps, usually with my higher end system I was getting over 120+. The optimization could be better, as like I said before, the pop in is bad, so I wonder if they did that intentionally to make game run better, without actually optimizating it properly. Optimization/PC Settings: 7/10Menu DesignThe menus look great, much like Bugbear's menus, but they are too cluttered with items that can confuse the player.Menu Design: 9/10Controls(I only used a controller) The handling is arcady. It's an improvement over the horrible unsteer seen in FlatOut Ultimate Carnage. Using the e-brake is also much more improved, but you can still spin out. Controls: (For controllers) 9/10CameraWhat an awful camera. It sticks too close to the car, violatly jerks around when spinning the camera, jumping of a ramp, or getting hit by a player. Boosting is even worst, as the camera shakes so erratically my eyes started to hurt. Camera: 0/10GamemodesThe gamemodes are very interesting and fun. The races are filled with destruction. Career can be  grindy at times. The demolition derbies are totally different, as they aren't realistic as previous titles, but still as fun. The new assault mode uses powerups to slow down, and wreck the enemies. It's like Mario cart on steriods, it is crazily fun. The stunt arena is back, with new challenges, and previous challenges making a comeback, like the Rings of Fire. These gamemodes are fun, and will have great replayabilty.Gamemodes: 9/10Online MultiplayerI was unable to find a lobby to test out the multiplayer.Online Multiplayer: n/aVehiclesI was hoping for the return of cars from previous titles, but was disappointed to see nothing. However, the cars in the game are good, and have their own unique personality.Vehicles: 8/10CustomizationJust like FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, the customization is not very extensive, with limited color changes, and no really visual changes, other than the exhaust color. They do still have the useful upgrades with engines, chasis, wheels, etc.Customization: 5/10Track DesignThe tracks are full of props, scenery, and plants to destroy. The tracks aren't nothing special, but they set the mood for FlatOut 4 very nicely.Track Design: 8/10CharactersOne of the big things with FlatOut Ultimate Carnages was the characters you raced against. They had a personality, some were more aggressive, others were more tactical. FlatOut 4's characters feel unspired, and empty. They don't feel different, and sometimes it can be hard to tell who drives what car. In FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, you knew who that b*tch was coming behind you to take you out.Characters: 1/10PhysicsThe physics have been improved for props, but worse for cars. In FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, props would be your worst nightmare. Not only would they slow you down, they usually would flip your car, and spin you right around, messing up your race. Here, the props still have an impact on speed, but they usual don't flip, or spin the car. Now when it comes to vehicle physics, it's a different story. Coupled with the bad camera, may times the vehicles physics will screw up when hitting jumps, getting knocked over, and hitting other player vehicles. They don't feel natural, as the cars seem extremely heavy. In FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, the cars felt more appropriate when it came to weight, and the physics didn't freak out like they do in this game. Physics: 6.5/10PropsLike I mentioned before, the props physics are improved, but I noticed that when a prop was stuck on my vehicle after a while, rather than flying off, it would simple disappear. Other times I drove right through them, without any hit detection.Props: 8/10DamageThe vehicle damage is very interesting. They deform way more than the other games, but in a very unrealistic way. Many times the bumpers don't fall off, and the doors clip through objects when opening. It just doesn't look right.Damage: 6/10AIThe vehicle AI isn't the smartest. They tend to crash themselves. However, they can be aggressive. I have gotten spun out many times by drivers, and they love grinding with other cars. The AI is easier than FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, but they can still put up a fight.AI: 8/10RagdollsCompared to FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, the ragdoll physics are horrible. They don't look natural at all, as they look very stiff, and can clip through objects easily.Radgolls: 3/10SoundThe sound design in this game is meh. Some cars sounds good, while others sound like vacuum cleaners full power. Also, you don't really hear the roar of the other cars in the game.Sound: 4/10SoundtrackThe soundtrack consists mostly of rock, heavy metal, punk rock and rock 'n' roll. I personly don't find the soundtrack that interesting, as FlatOut 2 really nailed the soundtrack, while this game misses the mark in interesting, and enjoyable music. It  doesn't set the mood very well, causing the music to feel out of place with the gameplay.Soundtrack: 5/10Final Score: 6/10FlatOut 4: Total Insanity sticks to some of it's Bugbear roots, while creating new ones. I still recommend the previous titles, compared to FlatOut 4 (except for FlatOut 3) This game is okay, but I still recommend this game, as the game is still enoyable, even with it's flaws.			"

												If you loved the orignal flatout games, then this is the game for you. It is a really well made game, and it fits well into the flatout formula. Feels like the old ones, but with udpated graphics. Very pleasant experience.			"

												I was excited for a prospect of an actually decent new Flatout, but ""decent"" the most you can describe it as.It's worse than Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage in just about every aspect. In most it's only slightly worse, it's no Flatout 3, but ""better than Flatout 3"" is a hell of a low bar to clear. It feels like Flatout Lite â€“ there is a sense that they tried to recreate the old ones, but it lacks their best and most fun aspects and moments.The driving is, put quite simply, not fun. The crashes lack any punch. I notice an opponent in front of me spin out and get sideways, nitro into him at full speed, and for that effort I'm rewarded with a plink which the game is happy to tell me was a ""great slam"". It actually felt like my car slowed down before the impact, as if to avoid the collision like I was playing full-assist mode in a circuit racer. The cars basically have three control types. All Derbies are understeering bricks, all Classics are spin-happy nitro machines, all Ultimates (or whatever the third one is) are 6x6 offroaders. None of the classes have any variety in character.Speaking of character, the cast of 7 (FO2) / 11 (FOUC) fun and varied opponents with actually different AI parameters have been replaced with two facial models caked in various forms of makeup, who drive exactly the same. Did they honestly think we wouldn't notice? Not that FO2/UC's opponents were some kind of RPG-esque well-written characters (they had a car set, a paragraph of bio, a ""photo"", a color scheme and some AI parameters tweaked), but this game manages to avoid even that.The Assault mode, which is essentially the only addition to this compared to FOUC, feels like a better fit in a kart game and has been better done in several of them.The music, after FO2 which basically defined my tastes for next 5 years and FOUC which, while not as impactful, still added a few bands to my notice list, is uninspired and lame. Most of the songs are in the genre of what I'd only call ""whine rock"".Even the graphics, which you'd think would be the one area where it's stupidly easy to improve after nine years are worse. Not from the technical standpoint, they've got the fancy reflections and godrays and whatever from the latest set, but it looks straight up worse because the environments are grey, the cars look dull, and the details are low-effort.Worst of all, this game gets boring. The races quickly become a grind. The stunts are a snorefest. (Seriously, how do you make flinging yourself into a Beer Pong cup uninteresting?) The derby is a succession of lame-feeling hits and watching the health bar go down.Maybe, if it was the only game in its genre, I'd be okay with it, as it has occasional cool moments and is, at the very least, competently made (as opposed to Flatout 3). But seeing as Flatout Ultimate Carnage is right nearby on Steam and ten times cheaper, there's just no point in buying this game.			"

Product received for free
The GoodGraphicsOverall, the graphics are good. The textures, reflections, particles, bloom and subtle motion blur definitely work quite well together.The BadUIThe UI is obviously built for a console, and even with that said could still use work. The mouse doesn't work on any of the menus, which kinda sucks, but isn't a huge deal to me. My main problem with the UI is the reward claiming. It goes through each individual reward separately, which makes you want to spam the button to continue. This can cause you to accidently start up another championship/race. It's quite frustrating.AII feel the AI in this game really need some work. It can be pretty inconsistant and unpredictable with you either leading by 30 seconds or losing by 30 seconds. The characters also seem to be pretty bland. One of the things I really liked about the Bugbear FlatOuts was that each AI had their own ""personality."" Each character had their own background and driving style, making them more memorable and allowing you to actually have rivalries with them (Yes, I'm talking about you Lei Bing and Jack Benton)Lack of ContentFor the asking price of $33.99 (at the time of purchase (and yes, a friend did buy it for me)), the game really isn't worth it. The car list is pretty weak for current standards, there aren't many tracks and the campaign feels like too much of a grind. Hopefully the devs will release some free content updates in the future.The UglyVehiclesThe vehicles really seem out of place is most cases. Their proportions seem off, as well as their overall style. The cars really don't look like they belong in the same class. The different classes are basically just the same cars with different modifications and slightly faster, and the extra speed doesn't mix well with the tracks or AI.PhysicsOh boy, where to start. The people who worked on the tracks must have been completely cut off from the people who did the physics. The tracks are laid out pretty okay (some tracks could be better), but the physics really don't like them. Small bumps seem to be the hardest thing for the cars to handle, often ending in your car spinning out, flipping and bouncing off multiple walls. The wheels also seem to act like spheres rather than cylinders, causing your car to flip while randomly try to climb walls. Moving onto the stunt mode, the character ragdolls aren't, well, good. For example, I was playing the new Cup Pong mode and my ragdoll kept spazzing out and either bouncing out of the cup or just getting stuck in the side of it. The vehicle impacts also seem a bit buggy with small taps sending you from full HP to a sliver, making the derby modes really frustrating.PerformancePerformance is okay, but there are some pretty significant problems. The FPS holds up okay(ish) for most part, but there's a few hitches and a ton of stuttering no matter what visual settings are being used. With VSync off, the screen tearing is unbearable. But with it on, the FPS fluctuates all over the place, but is still surprisingly playable. There's also no other AA options except for FXAA which kinda sucks.The NeutralFeelingI had to make a separate ""Neutral"" section just for this. The way this game feels hits pretty close to home. It's trying to be a FlatOut game, but can't quite pull it off. If a few bugfix and content updates were to be released, then I feel this game could actually be pretty great. But still, there ain't no FlatOut like a Bugbear FlatOut.Is it a fun game? In my opinion, yeah. But in it's current state, I sadly can't recommend it mainly due to its price and lack of content.This review is still a WIP and I'll update it when necessary / when I get around to it.			"

												Great fun! I'm hooked! Out and out arcade racing at full speed. Awesome music, lovely graphics.. it's a return to form for Flatout.They nailed the vibe just right with this one, too.. the graphics, the UI and the licenced music (not generic electronica) really take it back to the atmosphere Flatout got right in the first place. When you're flying along at 100mph down a narrow country track, it feels awesome even if the physics aren't quite as good as Bugbears. The physics in Fla4out are not as realistic as the first two games and there are some glitches with the suspension going over tracks and such in this one, but for arcade fun these do really well and for the most part they're really fun driving. I'm not totally convinced they work very well in the derby modes, but hey there's so much to do in this game I don't mind having a few 'meh' bits in with the good.If you went away after Flatout 3, it's OK.. you can come back now :)			"

												While it may merely be a nostalgic throwback for those that have fond memories of predecessors of the series and personallly your typical arcadey desctrution derby game from the PS2-era, it certainly knows what it is and does a generally god job of it.It is a bit stupid in some ways, but surely entertaining at the same time. It has a pretty good and certainly appropriate licensed soundtrack that you are likely to expect from this kind of game. A set of decent looking tracks, with plenty of different routes and stuff to break along the way and most of them offer a good variety of game modes; from simple races to destruction derbys and stunt events of different kinds. The characters that make out your oppostion are certainly related to the previously mentioned PS2-style driving games as well.The career mode makes for some enticing progression on various maps with most of the modes included. The AI leaves something to be wished for in places, but does a decent enough job for the most part. The price may be a bit high for what is an essential remake with slightly more content, but it is likely woth getting if you have some nostalgic feel for these kind of games.			"

												TL:DR - I'm nit-picky, the game is alright, but probably not worth $40.Flatout 4.... it's not bad, but it's not great either.As someone who still plays Flatout 2 somewhat regularly, my biggest gripe with the fourth installment in the series is that it's just too arcadey. ""But it's an arcade racer! It's supposed to be!"" I know. Let me elaborate.Flatout 1 and 2 were by no means simulation racers or even simcade racers (think GRID). But at their core, they were still grounded in reality (save for the driver ejection mechanic). The races were simply races. The cars weren't crazy or silly and they all made sense within their class. Derby cars were mostly used/junked race class cars, and the street cars were mostly just normal sports cars. In FO4, you find yourself racing:- An icecream truck- A modern sports car- A 50's sedanamong others, all within the Derby class. Sure they're junkers, but the wildly varying styles racing together leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Adding to FO4's silliness is the customizable nitro trail including confetti, bubbles, and money. This is completely optional but it feels more at home in Rocket League than Flatout. Additionally, FO4 features a car combat game mode that involves magically shooting oversized projectiles at other racers. Fun, but not really what I've come to expect from Flatout.However, the game is gorgeous. The driving mechanics are really solid (the crashes feel a little lame this time around though). And I really like the environment/track design. I wanted Flatout, but got the love child of Dirt: Showdown and Mario Kart.			"

												This is absolutely NOT a FlatOut game.not a single thing about this game tells me its a FlatOut game. it is a fun game, but it IS NOT FLATOUTthe only thing that pisses me off about this game other than the lies about featuring assets from previous FlatOut games, is the horrible horrible character designs. if i wanted some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ugly gmod avatar staring slightly to the left of me while i raced, id go play gmod. the character art was a special thing for me in the previous game, it gave the character personality. now ive got some army dude and a bunch of punk clowns with birth defects watching me while i drive.... theres not much customization at all other than stat based and preset car skins, nitro effects, and a horn (which is more than previous FlatOuts, but not worth using the word ""customizable"")not to mention, i bought the game right now rather than later because i saw i could get all the music for free.... it is NOT FlatOut style music. im not saying its bad, but not as good as FlatOut. so, i have no idea what people mean by this is a ""copy and paste of old FlatOut games"" because nothing here is from FlatOut. THAT SAID HERES A DISCLAIMER: i have, played, and still play the FlatOut titles by the original developer, Bugbear. Team6 threw away the FlatOut name, their games sucked. So if everything i said is false because theyre all assets from Team6's idea of FlatOut, then im very very sorry.... thats a sad sad story. which brings me back to ""This is NOT FlatOut"" because Team6 ate dirt.now i got that part out, the good part: its a decent game. ... ......... .............. thats all. yeah. ive enjoyed this half hour and will probably still be playing for a while. i like racing games, i like its style. just annoyed that its using the FlatOut brand without any connection to FlatOut at all. This reminds me of that NinjaTheory did to DMC. They didnt make a bad game, but they used an already successful name to make something else. Note to aspiring developers that want to make games in a series that already exists: STICK TO THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FORMULA quit this whole ""make something new"" â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. rather than tarnishing the name, make something that can stand with its predecessors.Edit: after playing a bit... â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off. think im passed my point of refund. whatever. cleared derby with all golds and still not all derby cars unlocked, turns out you need to play flatout mode to unlock all cars aaand.... carnage is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OFF especially with the car. coolest looking car = worst â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing handling. oh, the difficulty is also ramped by like 10 times. so all those cars i never got to know during campaign, found my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ real fast. yeah, i rage quit it. this is the 2nd company to fail at making a flatout game.

												My thoughts about this one are mixed but more towards the negative side. I would say that play ultimate carnage or wait for some other game like this. Flatout has lost its cool it seems like. The game feels...really empty to me, the characters (i know its a racing game but still) are just there. They don't feel like people, just a bunch of random clowns and army people.4/10 "

FlatOut is back!Well, actually FlatOut 2 is back, and on steroids, too! After the atrocious FlatOut 3 (which may have put off a lot of people) I can happily state that FlatOut 4 is everything the FlatOut 2 fan can whish for, and all that with modern graphics and physics. If you are a fan of rough and fast arcade crash racing, you will find no better. Get it!			"

												How you can see i only played the game for 20minutes. But there are a few things i can say about this game right now.1. All in all it LOOKS like a good game. - Menu is good- driving physics is good- many gamemodes2. BUT the game has totally failed at giving feedback to crashes, nitro etc.- when you use nitro, the screen just totally freaks out and vibrates (i set vibration to zero), so u cant really control where u are driving at or, more important u cant really crash someone.- when u crash someone (which we all really want and love because of FO 2) it just vibrates and nothing else really happens. No crash sound, no chipping carpartikels, no healthbar which decreases in a satisfying way. (all these things made FlatOut 2 so great). (It was these absolutly satisfying crash feedback u got when u crashed something in FO 2)else:. Games these days try to impress with their great graphics and stuff. But i thing a simple graphics would be much better. What i mean is, i just think everything looks awefull. Just Open FlatOut 4 and then FlatOut 2. FO 2 just looks soo much nicer. So when they would change these things, it would be a great game.			"

I can see us having another great 10yrs of fun in this game not only in the stunts but also the racing.

												As a big fan of Flatout 1, 2 & Ultimate Carnage I really like it but WHY? WHY couldn't you have made stunts on-line multiplayer? I've always played Ultimate Carnage stunts mode on 360 with a group of friends and the thought that I could finally play it, even when they're not availble, with many different people, was really exiting. I like it overall but that's really disapointing.			"

												Great game, feels like a copy-paste of the old games but with new content, even the menus are similar!Crash feedback doesn't feel quite right and the damage models are very hit or miss, depending on the vehicle.Licensed songs with lyrics, so no very low budget generic rock tracks here.It has a new gamemode somewhat similar to mario kart, which is chaotic at best and messy at worst.After the mess that was Flatout 3 I didn't expect to ever see another good Flatout game, and while this isn't as amazing as Ultimate Carnage, it's still a very good surprise coming from a studio with no past experience in these type of games.If you're a Flatout fan this game is for you; a near carbon copy of the first 2. Also Allstar vehicle class looks FREAKING AWESOME! Like it came out of a zombie movie.My only real gripe with this game is that the devs apparently hired the most incompetent marketing team ever. "

												I tested the Game for 2 Hours and refunded it. This is a very good budget Titel, but not enough for a full price game. IÂ´m a fan of FO 1+2 and  think that FO 4 is nearly as good. I will wait to buy it at a fair price in the future.			"

												Extremly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ consol port, minimum requirements is a GTX 650, recommended requirements is a GTX 780. I use a GTX 980Ti and a Intel i7 6700k OC.  I have frames between 145 and 5. As soon as there are props like bushes or oder ""Npc cars"" the fps goes down to about 10. And that ever 30 seconds.  This all happenes at lowest graphic settings.I cannot say anything good about the games just because I can`t play it. The soundtrack sound pretty cool but thats all I can say about this ""consol ****""I know I can`t review a game after 20min of gameplay, but the problem is, I cannot judge the game itself because of the reasons told above.

												Fun for the hole family!  A total wreckfest - like your room, and your face, and mom.  Physics bores me like school, physics fun, smashy and ragdoll is best part.  DUH.			"

												Well as a big fan of flatout 2.. I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited, yet very aware this could be a giant let down..Lets start out with the cons.Car skins  (they either are extremely goofy or super super sporty.. think GTR and an icecream truck)Lack of advertisement for the game (Only happened to come across this on upcoming racer games online searches)if you get in an accident in the game on certain maps, if you fly off the track and into said building that looks like its inthe distance.. you fly through it and respawn. (not a big deal imo, but still something I've noticed)The impact of other cars as it is mightily satisifying still to T-bone somebody.. The collision sounds could be a bit better, as flatout 2 had it.Anyways, the Pros here1. Game runs flawless if you turn on V-sync (I believe it is a must, without it ran a lil choppy going from 200 fps (cap) to 150 in certain spots2. The maps are absolutely beautiful and extremely well done, you can see where their time has obviously gone.. and it does not fall on closed eyes.  Well done3. The maps have many MANY different routes when you compare them to flatout 2, which was one of my favorite aspects of that game.4. That insane nitrous feeling is amazing when you are blitzing thru these well-made maps.  It is a lot of fun5. It is full of good laughs with your friends which seems it will have countless hours written all over it.6. The cars sound absolutely amazing.. Granted some of them don't match, but what are you really going to make an icecream truck sound like, besides a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in monster of a beast. ;)Overall I think this game has been a good purchase so far and I hope people aren't blinded by their hatred for the past flatouts to overlook this one.  It is well done and hopefully these guys continue to update it!!You very well could be seeing the start of a new racing game through these guys.			"
