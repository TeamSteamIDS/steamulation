												This game is about 2% of the quality of Fifa/PES titles. It's also 2% of the price. Have at it.LocoSoccer is a hilariously low-quality physics game. The enjoyment of it is in its simplicity and the stupidity that happens on most plays. For a buck, you can't go wrong but if you're really careful with your money and feel a dollar isn't worth the risk, look up the browser-based game Soccer Physics and give that a go as it's a much shorter version of the same concept. Where that is a 1-minute game, LocoSoccer ups the ante with a full on 5 minutes of gameplay per match with a team of 5. Contrary to some of the other reviews, you can switch players if you happen to read the controls (which are really like 4 buttons. I literally play this one handed).			"

												Lowcoball, while mostly bugless, features comically low production quality and, as other reviews have said, a mostly random playtime environment. I think that if it came out 20 years ago it would be an arcadey cult classic, but in this stage of video game development it's not there at all. If you want to buy a derpy game for your child to play while you go do something, or if you want a funny game to show your friends, go for it. But it's not worth any more than its price tag.  "

												 Endlessly, Dubiously scanning the ""Under 2 dollars"" games list with the pitiful toppence in my steam wallt when I spy this game.. The store page didn't look like much, But the reviews mostly pointed to a hilarious experience so I take a chance and buy this game.. Upon getting past the settings interface doubtingly setting the graphics to 'fantastic' in a tongue-in-cheek sort of manner I play my first round.. Couldn't figure out how to move my guys and noticed the AI bots cheat on easy (Using SHIFT to spin around). Finally learn to move ONE set of guys, Lost 7-0. Second match, Managed to figure out how to switch to my other team of guys using the number keys.. Figure out how to use SHIFT correctly, Win 9-4. Third round after buying some novelty stuff with my pitiful winnings, Found out I can get all four of my guys AND the goaler to shove the entire opposing team, AND their ball down the field. After a furious struggle of tug-of-war we pushed everyone AND the ball in the goal and won 8-3. Prognosis: Best one dollar I ever spent. My only complaints are the backround sound loops badly (Needs to be cut seamless) and has random disjointed voices of people talking. Likely recorded, And the lack of some method of making your own parts shirts or heads, And no online multiplayer. Despite the few flaws though and an 'unpolished' feel that some more serious gamers might avoid this is hilarious fun, Especially if you take the time to set up keyboard/joypad or joypad/joypad local play.9/10. Looking forward to the PS4 mega HD director's cut limited edition preorder collectible metal tin-and-biscuit remake. "

												Almost every time reviewing a Unity engine game I have to say it's interface feels clunky & unresponsive, in this one they made that irritating quality a stepping stone of their gameplay - the whole process of 'soccer' is chaotic beyond measure, yet the AI is always more aware of the possible ball's trajectories than you could ever be. This is meant to achieve comedy effect, it succeeds for the first minutes... I mean, how fun a broken keyboard is? And if you hit it against your own head? It certainly may be quite fun if you play before a (heavily drunk) audience though.It's a 2d game with crude 3d graphics, where you get 'to control' (irony) 5 blocks colored as soccer players (2 pairs and a goalie), you switch between them with 1-2-3 numerical keys, these blocks can move from side to side, jump up and jump sidewards rotating in the air. Pairs can part at your command, but in reality they just part on collisions & jumps, then you have hard time getting them where you want (like it wasn't so before). Most goals are totally unexpected, sometimes ball just stalls under a pile of blocks for half a match, both players being unable to move further (more like a rugby game). Other times ball gets airborn and jumps its relentless sine path ignoring physical laws in a random direction. AI goalie sometimes saves, player's almost helpless if unlucky.Probably this makes an allright local party game, but can also lead to madness in a loser & rage attacks when unlucky, for it often feels really unfair - strange hitbox detection, unpredictable lunar physics, sometimes what should move stands still and vice versa. Take with caution! I recommend only because of its low price & stupid fun.			"

												This game is dumb, not in the negative  way, but like a regular show dumb kinda way. sometimes you score a goal and you meant it and sometimes you throw your guy at the ball and the ai hits in in for ya. i had some trouble trying to figure out how to control people and i dont get how switching my characters clothes works but honestly for two bucks if youre really gonna complain about this game then youre probably a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ person. i once they get multiplayer and once the tutorial isnt harder than the actual game itself then i see this game easily worth the buy			"

Pros-Very nice soundtrackA lot of fun with SHIFTCustomization of players and ballsA lot of teams with custom stats(even with names for each player!)Cons-Some bugs, that will probably get fixed in future patchs			"

												HOW DAFUG AM I SUPPOSED TO EVEN SWITCH MY PLAYERS! I mean this game doesnt really tell you all the controlls... I kinda wouldn't kinda do I kinda like this game but on the other side Not really.. For people who like very stressful games.. I MEAN SERIOUSLY I JUST GOT THIS AND I CANT EVEN CHANGE TO MY GOALIE NOR MY OTHER PLAYERS I MEAN REALLY DID U ADD THOSE IN FOR MORE STRESS BECUASE THE NPC'S CAN USE THE GOALIE THATS BULL******EDIT** Just fix that and tell us how to switch to our goalie and our other teammates because i swear its Stressful.***EDIT*** So im here again I read the disc bellow and it said how to change the group and its numpad (Why Numpad? i never use it). The NPC's are very fishy like they are cheating they seem to always want the ball out of bounds when its on their side the Controlls are okay, The gameplay is not very good but its a start I bought this game when it came out so its pretty buggy the NPC's or even me the Ball gets stuck in between our feet like we are a robot rolling around as a wheel for a soccer ball which is silly but you need to fix it and more people will like this game (P.S. This game is like the Impossible game to win)****EDIT**** I am getting better and better and the spinning mechanic helps me. This is a short edit because i haven't found much more glitches.*****EDIT***** Okay this is not like a impossible to win game when you get the hang of it. When you do good you get more effectiveness the more you lose the less effective this game is a great time waster to do when your bored! I will highly suggest this game now! He finally updated it and we get to see trading cards. Any stuff like that anybody who see this review, you know I love this game now!******EDIT****** I love the Customization in this game its silly it brings out such memes Like Spoderman and Bobo Punk. He added Bobo Punk 2 now and I love it. Still You should really get this. Play it for a while get used to it. It'll be fun I betcha. If your reading this all, Appreciate it if you do, You will understand what I like and love about this game and I might make more edits throughout. I'm the longest comment and I just love this game. So peace out until the next edit guys!			"

												I bought this game, looking at the trailer and thinking to myself, ""Oh, so like a paid Soccer Physics."" Boy was I wrong.While it has the Soccer Physics feel and hilarity, it sets itself away from SP by enabling the player to control 5 players on one team. Once I learned how to play and started the campaign, I was laughing my ♥♥♥ off. Totally worth it.Though the Tutorial was a bit tough, but, since there's no game mechanics, the game itself would be very hard. This whole game is just luck, but god damn, is it fun!10/10 would make a video about it.			"

												Upon buying this game, I felt immediately hooked to the campaign. It caused cliffhangers, action packed animation and it even caused me from my doing any of my university work, stopping me from going to the toilet, avoiding huge meal times to ensure I can get efficient time on the game and even blocking myself away from family and friends. LocoSoccer is life-changingly good. Unfortunately the developer couldn't offer me a soundtrack or a CD with the music theme which was a massive shame as the three second loop was absolutely FIRRRREEEE!!!!!!!.WARNING! DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE AS THIS GAME WILL IMMEDIATELY TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOUThe graphics were impressive, the gameplay was outstounding and the card collecting was fun, it was like going to your nearest store and buying the pack hoping you earn that one card you needI give LocoSoccer a solid 11.74/10 and here's its good and bad points+ Outstanding graphics and gameplay+ It is only ♥♥♥♥ing 35p, the same price as a ♥♥♥♥ing energy drink+ The music is on the same level as Moonbahton- NO ♥♥♥♥ING NEGATIVES...THE GAME IS SICK!!

However...- This game NEEDS to be optimised- There is almost no difference between the ""Very Low"" and ""High"" settings, except that it runs worse on High.- I wish this game had multiplayer- The Tutorial is a lot harder than the actual gameOtherwise, if I had to choose between this game and a Snickers bar, I would take this game.
