												Thank the Zaibatsu (Two Best Friends Play)! This game lives up to the hype, the only problem I have is that it is listed to have trading cards but does not. Game seems improved 10 fold since XBLA and hope to see some Endless run updates/settings/options.			"

The sense of speed is great and that feel when you slide under obstacles or bank around corners at full speed... awesome! This isn't AA title but hey, there is hard to find similar game to this one and I assure you that running is really enjoyable. There are 3 types of levels: free run where you grab the power cells, drag where the timing is important and speed where you run with high speed and avoid obstacles. Visual aesthetics with changing theme of colors and electronic soundtrack really fits in. Raising difficulty make this game more and more challenging... good luck with level 41! "

												While similar to Race the Sun, I had much more fun with T.E.C. 3001!  A great run/dodge game to test one's hand-eye coordination, I whole-heartily recommend T.E.C. 3001 - especially if you like racing games!Since I am an old fart, I appreciated the levels that locked you to your lane; this actually made it like a different game, as the ""regular"" levels have momentum to think about... can't just twitch through it!  Excellent variety!The graphics are clean and crisp, nothing jaw-dropping, but this game should not be played for graphics alone (should any game?); the soundtrack is well-fitting, techno-based that completes a solid package of a game.  For the price, just buy it.I use Linux (Mint 16 x64 Xfce) and the game runs very smooth (nVidia driver).  It is a great casual game that one can play for 30 seconds or 30 minutes.			"

												After playing a bit of this game now I feel I can write an honest review on it, so here goes. T.E.C 3001 is a runner, where you control a robot through various courses in different game modes. The campaign consists of 3 game modes, a freerun mode, a speed run mode and a drag race mode. On top of these campaign gamemodes there is a seperate mode to play which is the unlimited runner mode.In freerun mode, you get full control of your character to jump between the various levels and layers of the pre-generated worlds. You can use all the controlls, boost, slide, jump and double jump to traverse the areas, being faced with obstacles like barriers and walls you can slide under, and speed boost power ups. Freerun requires you to take full advantage of these abilites, by facing you with walls that require precision timing for you to dodge past. This is where the game really shines, as you are not on set tracks and are free to jump away from the path entirely, only to come back in having looped around a tough obstacle. Throughout these stages there are checkpoints, so if you muck up right near the finish line you won't have to start from the very beginning which is a very forgiving bonus. These levels don't require you to take a set path, you can alternate between the many layers of the track at will which gives every replay a unique feeling and keeps the track fresh, for a time anyway. Speed Run mode is a more traditional runner mode, reminiscent of games like Temple Run. You are stuck to one course where you must simply dodge the obstacles that are presented. You use the arrow keys to switch between the three lanes, having no option to jump out of the track like you can in Freerun. The tracks are usually straight forward and require you to pick up the collectables to finish. Drag Race mode requires you to time your boosts, bound to the up arrow, to speed up and finish the course before the time is up. The obstacles in this mode are straight forward, and unlike the other two modes there is no way to switch between lanes. You are bound to the middle lane and must time your boosts with the icons on the track to get enough speed in time. Unlimited Runner is more of a side mode, you won't be spending as much time on it as the campaign unless you like the feel of an endless track runner. It is a randomly generated track, built on the Speed Run mechanics, so there's not much to say about it. Now these are my opinions on the gamemodes. Freerun, as I already stated, is certainly the strong point of the game. It is interesting and tries its best to stay that way, and will be the mode you look forward to while playing the campaign. Speed Run is fun, but gets old quickly. It is more enjoyable to play in the form of Unlimited Runner in my opinion because this really extends the longevity of it and allows for high score beating and the like. Drag Race feels like it was thrown in as a filler, because I honestly don't have much fun with it at all. It's repetive, and feels like a grind to complete, and not a unique experience. It gets boring quick and you probably won't look forward to playing it, or not as much as other modes. For the price, T.E.C 3001 is an amazing game. It offers quite a bit of gameplay while staying fresh and interesting besides a few letdowns. It has simplistic yet beautiful visuals and a nice soundtrack, and is a great experience. If I were to change anything about it, it would be to remove the Drag Race game mode and try to add even more variety to Freerun (Tracks that curve upwards, requiring you to run on the roof?) and possibly some more variety to Speed Run to make it feel less repetitive. Other than these slight hinderances, it's almost a garaunteed buy for me and a rating of 8/10.			"

												Welcome to a futuristic virtual reality world where you play as a soulless automaton. Let’s call him Tom for short, Tom is designed to move forward without stopping. T.E.C. 3001 is a runner in third or first person where you need to make it from the start to the finish of each course. It sounds simple and it might even sound mundane, but T.E.C. manages to mix things up with a lot of abilities and types of tracks that keep every moment engaging.The game has a beautiful color scheme and its humble in terms of graphics, but it gets the job done admirably. For the most part, each area consists of a single color’s hue. You’ll see tones of red and when you pass through a gate, then the tone will meld into blue, then yellow and so on.  Even a simple color change makes the game look fresh. There are still environments for all of these courses that make them look different even if its just the same objects. You’ll see mountains in the distance, a futuristic grid from the 1980s, and walls. So many walls.Like most runners, T.E.C. is a one more try sort of game. Slamming into a wall will send you back to the last checkpoint, but there’s so little downtime that it keeps you in the action for just one more time again and again. In this case, Tom is running for batteries in a race against time. You only have X number of seconds to make it to the goal and you need to collect Y number of batteries along the way.As you speed along, the game will pinpoint and highlight the batteries for a brief moment before you’re near them. That way you can prepare for them. Depending on how many you get, there are three ranks for each course and all courses can be replayed to your heart’s content for better times.Truth be told, the runner genre is one of my least favorite that I can still tolerate to play. I see the genre as a one trick pony while T.E.C. 3001 is a mustang that turns every course into a magic show. There is a lot of diversity here. For starters, because the camera chases after the metal man so you have control to turn him left and right. Its the full motion that makes this game more engaging and challenging than a typical runner.With Tom’s speed he turns slow, which is okay given the genre. Almost every course opens up into branches that allow for some nonlinear play. Take one path on this run, take another on that run. The game shines when there are multiple paths for you to jump between both up and down below.Tom has several standard abilities, such as a sliding kick that will get you under limbo walls. There is a standard jump, but also a double jump. You can even dash to break through glass and dash in mid air to make it across extra long gaps. The course has a variety of arrows, green arrows make you move faster, red arrows slow you down. Some levels have timing arrows that consist of red, yellow and red. Hit a speed boost on a specific arrow to determine if you’ll go faster or slower. Think of it as Guitar Hero with one button and one chord.Hitting the red arrows lets you move slow enough where you can jump off a course’s path and then double jump back onto the same path. There are high jump pads that send you into the air and even sky diving rings that you dash through to leap off and then dash through the landing rings or slam into the ground. In flight you can move around to dodge things. Its all an impressive array of tricks. Just when you think the game is out of tricks, another one is conjured up for you, such as what I can only describe as a freeway on ramp. Tom turns slow, so these are generous wide turns on narrow platforms.There is some thought, logic and strategy to these tricks, such as falling down a far distance and still landing on the course will tumble Tom into a vulnerable state where for a brief moment, Tom cannot jump, dive or anything like that. Dashing leaves you with the same vulnerability. If you dash and fail to achieve what you meant to, its another split second before you can use it again. Its all timing and its easy enough, but the game begins to wildly throw obstacles at you after you’re in the tenth course.To mix up the gameplay, there are some courses where the full ability to run where you please is taken away and it turns into running on three rails to which you just left and right between them. These tend to be faster paced levels. You’ll find an endless mode that makes use of this three lane mechanic as the game throws walls, vaults and limbos at you.My only real problem with the game is that it takes away the instructions. In an age where people complain about hand holding, I felt like there were times when I needed it. Such as the double jump into a dash mid air. After one failure, the instruction never appeared again without restarting the entire level. That instruction might also throw people off, but when you see it once, that’s it.For anyone with friends, there is two player split screen where you compete against one another on the same track. I had to compete against a controller on a pillow and after one slip up, it managed to take the lead. A failure on your part sends you back a bit.At $4, that’s the right price for the game, its enough to be a diversion and one of the best in its shallow genre. Its worth taking a risk if you’re even remotely interested in it.			"

												The infinite runner is one of those genres like the cover-based shooter and the instrument-focused music game that really blossomed in the last few years.There’s plenty of infinite runners that show both innovation and fun design for gamers looking for a bit more challenge and the recent Steam re-release of T.E.C. 3001 stands as a prime example. T.E.C. 3001 puts you in the shoes of some robot, dashing along virtual-reality cityscapes in an attempt to collect batteries. Developers Phoenix Games claims you’re collecting “virtual space energy leftovers for humanity”, which all sounds fun and ’90s sci-fi enough.The sense of speed is great, and the feeling of momentum as you slide under obstacles or bank around corners is impressive. The game boasts a foot tapping and rather infectious electronic soundtrack that suits the pace of the action. The gameplay is nicely broken up and varied by the addition of differing styles of courses; drag race stages give you no control over direction and instead focus on speed changes and obstacle dodging, while the ‘lane swap’ levels often move at an impressive breakneck speed throughout and only offer you the ability to move between three lanes of movement. This variety was a welcome break from the game’s usual gameplay. Control mappings are rather unintuitive at first, with the different between ‘charge’ and ‘speed up’ escaping me during the tutorial due to no explanation. While TEC 3001 is nothing to necessarily write home about, it is a competent and relatively fun distraction. With 41 courses and some local splitscreen race modes, it provides several hours of content for a low price of admission. Essentially, the game offers a good budget alternative to other popular ‘runner’ style games on Steam at the moment.			"

Definitely has potential but ends in an exercise of frustration...The game starts out well...collect items on the way to the finish line while trying to get the best time possible.  The first problem becomes evident fairly early on:  the controls stink.  The second problem revealed after several levels in, is that the path you are to take near-impossible to tell.I reached level 26 before I finally threw in the towel.  I then did the ""Endless Run"" mode a couple times just to round out my experience with the game.The Pros:+ Nice idea+ Good sensation of speed+ Leaderboard+ Quite a few levels (41)The Eh:~ Graphics and animations are OK.~ Checkpoints, but...  They have checkpoints, but on the difficult levels they are too far apart.~ Game seems to be two different games.  Which game are they making?  Seems like the devs couldn't decide between a (all-too-common) 3-path run/jump/slide game as on mobile devices, and a first-person runner.  These completely distinct play styles are used on different levels.  They should have picked ONE and made THAT game.~ No bonus for speed or additional items?   No additional 'bonus' as far as I could readily tell for collecting additional batteries along the level or finishing much quicker.  I suppose the 1, 2 or 3 lightning bolts for your 'grade', but when there's upwards of 20 to 40 items on the level does an extra few matter?  Or an extra few seconds?  To me, I just got the minimums and moved on and still had many 3-lightning bolt rankings for the levels, so why bother?The Bad:- Leaderboard Scoring How?  I have no idea how you score points toward the leaderboard.  I reached level 26 and ran over 2000 ""units"" in endless mode, yet still have a score of ""0"".- Perfect timing required.  Too many times where perfect timing is required.- Must memorize map too often.  It's not so much a game of skill or reflexes if they put things just out of sight that will kill you (a turn or a hole) unless you prepare on the previous obstacle ""just so"".  Impossible NOT to die the first time, leaving you having to memorize the course.- Paths are too narrow.  Jumping from one ""I-Beam"" (your path) to another ""I-Beam"" next to you is incredibly difficult given 1) how far apart they make the beams, 2) how slowly you turn, and 3) how narrow the beams are.  This becomes an increasingly common event.- Reach checkpoint but running too slow to finish level.  You can reach a checkpoint at too slow a speed to complete what is just after that checkpoint.  Thus when you die (as you will), you start at the checkpoint again too slow to complete the next obstacle.  Leaving you no choice but to quit and restart the level from the beginning.By level 26 and 2 hours down, I've had enough.  Sorry, I can't recommend this until it gets better controls or removes the need for repeated incredibly precise jumps/actions. "

												Plain in simple in it's delivery, but engaging while playing. T.E.C is a 3D linear running game.This game feels like it was greatly paid attention to, from the gameplay to the visual details and music. There are three basic modes to T.E.C. The first requires you to run in a straight line and commit to certain dodge techniques. The second sort of works like a grid system, where acceleration and top speed rise sharply and quick manouevers are needed. The third mode consists of free running, where the player is in full control of every tilt their player makes. This last game mode is what makes this game unique. There are levels where I've felt I've barely made the turn but still managed to make it to the end. The free running is extremely fun as you'll quickly be jumping platform to platform (which go in all directions). One thing I've noticed in free running is some courses require the player to make 360 degree turns running up a platform. As the joystick is held in one direction, the player finally starts leaning inwards making a sharper turn, while the camera begins to rotate over the shoulder. This is a cool concept, and makes for a great visual, but can make it hard to control the runner accurately. I also have no idea how to reset the camera back to normal when that happens. On top of creative level design and good control schemes, the game offers local co-op on top of multiplayer. Third and first person views are also a feature in the game. The visuals are appealing, and game (and menu) colors change with each color-icon you hit. Graphics are sharp but there seems to be more room for improvement here. The backgrounds are quite plain. Level designs are immaculate as there is no one way to go about your business, which makes it welcoming to local co-op. Sounds are few but on point. I like when the runner jumps from a height and that smashing metal sound plays. Music seems to be original and some tracks are quite catchy. For future T.E.C games, perhaps make a ""fight"" mode for local co-op where players can run into one another, or perhaps strike each other as a distraction. Also, maybe having an options to designate sensitivity of the joystick would be appreciated, unless the dev's wanted this certain feel. RATING : 7.35/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :  The free form control I was speaking of as well as multiple choices for routes You can slide in third person or first person Proof of the third or first person view options Any game that has double jump, I am a huge fan of "

												Did you play Temple Run, or Subway Surfers? Now let's add dubstep, cool futuristic graphics, a campaign, a multiplayer mode, more options, fluorescent colors, speed, and in general... steroids. That, at least for me, is T.E.C. 3001.But don't get me wrong, this game is not easy. There are some very hard and rage-inducing levels. Also the multiplayer, apart from being fun, can be very stressful.There're 3 types of levels. One in which you have to hit spacebar at the right moment to get enough speed to finish the level. One in which you have to switch between 3 lanes, jump and slide to avoid obstacles and not crash. And my favorite level type (that in my opinion is meant to be played with a controller) the one in which you can freely move in the road, choose a path, change path, long jump, adjust speed, and much more.Now, clearly I like this game, and if you read this and thought ""yeah, seems cool"", you're going to love this game!

You'll get hooked almost immediately.-Surprisingly varied. You think it will be the same thing over and over, but you'll be hit with surprises every time.-Endless running option is great to keep a personal record.-There's a multiplayer option to compete with friends.-The stages gradually become more challenging as you also gradually get better.-Low system requirements. Even potatoes can run it.-Smooth animations.-Music you won't get tired of even if you play for hours.-Loving the colorscheme change.-You can get creative when it comes to passing hard obsticles.Cons:-Not for people who give up easily when things get difficult.-The later stages can be really frustrating.-When you accidently go through a checkpoint when you're slowed down you have to reset the whole stage.Overall this game is amazing and provides you with hours of fun and insanity. Definitely worth the price!			"

												T.E.C. 3001 is a nice little runner-platformer (of the 3D variety). Things get difficult quick, there will be lots of deaths, and the game is all about quick reflexes and precision in timing jumps and moving your character. I like these types of games that are suited to a shorter playing session. Yes, it is on iTunes for iPhone/iPad (launched 2013), but worth noting it was on XBLIG even further back in 2011. So to disregard this as a cheap mobile game is folly.Graphics and soundtrack in the game are fine. Nothing spectacular, but not bad either. Worth noting you can choose your color/theme, and also which soundtrack to play. Content is aplenty, and certainly worth $4. Game starts off slow, but within 10 levels you'll start feeling the challenge. For completionists, the 41 levels should keep you occupied and challenged for a bit.All in all, if you're a fan of precision platformers, then this would suit you. Or if you just want a challenging game to take your mind off the ""AAA"" game you're been playing. But if you dislike games of this nature (everyone has their own tastes, right?), then maybe you should stay away.UPDATE: Really loving the game the more I play it. The achievements are well-done and make you go back and play certain levels either faster, or to get all collectibles. Only complaint now is that...the level-specific achievements are too sparse!

Bullet points  Speedrunning without the six-month route design phase  Excellent (think Bill & Ted) graphic style  Initially difficult controls, but you do acclimateFull reviewI figured I'd probably like this game when I picked it up, and I was right. If you're interested in the feel of speedrunning without spending hours plotting your own route or learning the minute specifics of a game engine, definitely check this out.Check the screenshots/video on the store page to see what the game's going to look like; if you like that visual style, you won't be disappointed. The visual feel is very ""'80s cyberspace""...the same kind of vibe as Lawnmower Man, but updated for modern graphics hardware. :) The audio is OK as well; I can only say ""OK"" because the game is so demanding of your attention that honestly I never had time to actually listen to the music. I did sample them from the pause screen, though, so I did notice they were pretty good.When I first started playing, the game seemed overly hard due to the (lack of) responsiveness of the character. To put it another way...you corner like a boat. A large boat...like a cruise ship. It's really frustrating in the beginning, because it feels unfair considering the speed that obstacles are coming at you. Hang in there, though; it does get easier. Well, I mean, it never gets any easier but you get better at it. You'll learn that the secret is to anticipate what's coming, and already be ready to get into position. Technically that is a minus in my book, since I don't like when a game requires you to have already played the level to beat it. Having said that, the game is fun enough that it's still worth it.  It occurs to me, after further thought, that perhaps a counter-argument to this would be that if the character were that responsive, you'd constantly be flying off the map due to over-sensitivity.Getting all the achievements is a serious challenge. Now, getting most of the achievements is relatively easy, once you've gotten good with controlling the character. But the last two (""Marathon"" and ""Unbreakable"") are no joke, and ""Undying"" isn't a walk in the park either (although I did manage to get that one). That said, for those of you that judge games based on their difficulty (Super Meat Boy fans, etc.) shouldn't pick this up for a persistent, serious challenge because the bulk of the gameplay is...well, it's not what you'd call easy but it's definitely not Super Meat Boy.Fun game, and already one set of free content updates...good stuff!If you like this game, check out...

												T.E.C. 3001 is as if Audiosurf, Tron, Wipeout and/or Trackmania had a kid and decided to let it run free until the end of time. If you ever enjoyed dodging the grey blocks in Audiosurf, you'll definitely like what the Endless mode has to offer, as it is nearly identical in feel; three lanes, near instant switching between them, and obstacles that you have to jump over, slide under or just plain avoid. It gets increasingly harder, and around 4,000 units, you'll even get to see gaps in the course that you'll have to jump across.There's also the campaign which lasts for a few hours on your first playthrough, although it's hypothetically possible to finish it in about 40 minutes. The campaign has three different modes that the varying stages make use of; The sprint mode is a one-lane course with obstacles, boosting panels and batteries to charge your own boost meter that you can use. The timelimit of these are often strict, and you might just end up having to grind it out 'til near perfection.There's also a freerunning mode that lets you have more free reign over the controls, but it feels vastly different from the other two modes. It does, however, feel like the ""main"" mode of the campaign. The level design of these levels are generally great, while the other two modes have the movement-limits and thus also in a sense limit the level design.The third and final mode is just as the endless mode, although with static levels instead of randomly generated ones. This also means that there could be elevation differences and other elements that you normally won't find in the endless mode.Overall, it's a game well worth the few bucks if you're into this kind of game, be it through its aesthetic feel or through gameplay.

												Dfificult game, but difficulty is well balanced, graphics is great (music is good). The biggest advantage is level architecture (not monotous at all). You won't get bored. The game is well prepared. The only con is there is no gamepad keys information in tutorial (you must check it yourself) "

												I had Pepsi Man for the Playstation and played it a lot as a child, and this game gives me so much nostalgia!If you like running games, you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics and music are great, there are gates that change the colore theme of the environent (thus far I do not think it has any actual gameplay effect). The music selection is very good and pumps you up very well. The color theme for the main menu can be changed, which was a nice touch. You have the option of changing your robot character's skin from metallic to wired (to make it match the environment better), and you can also change the point of view from third-person to first-person - I highly recommend first-person to add to the intensity.The gameplay consists of you running from point A to B without falling off the track or hitting objects (restarting you at the last checkpoint). You also must collect x batteries in some of the game variants, or else you will have to restart. The control scheme is very simple, and the learning curve is minimal; however, the difficulty progresses at a reasonable rate to keep you challenged.There are a few different game variants - there is an Endless mode where you just run as far/long as you can, and campaign consists of: a Free mode much like Pepsi Man, where you control your character and have to collect a minimum number of batteries to progress to the next stage; a Drag mode where you are just running in a straight line and must complete it within a time limit (you have to time your spacebar presses accordingly); and a Track mode, where you can move freely onto one of three tracks (this is how Endless mode is also played). Track mode also prevents you from doing things like bunny hopping off the side of the track and landing back on it in order to avoid difficult obstacles (this is actually a mechanic in Free mode).The beginning stages offer quick, simple tutorials to help you speed through the game. Overall, if you like straight running games, pick this one up.Recommend! "

												T.E.C. 3001 is a skill based parkour-runner, and I was very surprised with the amount of content and replayability this game provides for merely 4 bucks. In addition to the pleasing visuals, and a very nice soundtrack, there's also gameplay that takes minutes to learn yet is hard to master without being boring or annoying. Actually there were no points in the game where I felt frustrated by the game mechanics, if I failed at a certain spot I knew it was just my fault for not reacting quick enough, the checkpoints are also very well placed.And this is probably the only game that made me feel like i'm going REALLY fast, Sonic has got nothing on this robot) "

												Probably one of the best low budget games, given that you like running games. It's a bit like audiosurf,  not too easy and not too hard. I played it with a gamepad and it works really well, however the tutorials only show the keyboard controls, so you have to figure out the gamepad controls by trial & error, but that's not really a big deal. I feel like I owe the developers some money, because 0,79€ is definitly a joke. 9/11 will play again.			"

												I'll recommend this game since it's so cheap and is pretty solid for what it is. It's a running game where you can double jump, slide and boost, and you have to collect batteries while you do it. It's levels are split into two different styles, ones that lock you into one of three lanes and ones that give you complete control over your location/direction. The former is simpler and focuses on coordinating sliding and jumping while the latter levels allow for more creative paths through levels. This game is great when you get going extremely fast and the level design accomodates it, but I generally found the game to be a bit boring for the most part. There's not a whole lot to keep you interested. My major gripe with the game is the use of the red ""slow-down"" arrows that if touched, slow you down to a snail's pace. They are ok when used appropriately with the level design, but usually when you  hit one you have to intentionally kill yourself to restart. Or you might try to finish the rest of the level at the slow pace, only to fail and waste a few minutes. It's quite annoying.A solid running game nonetheless, I'd wait to get it in a bundle.			"

												A great runner game, although small in size the price tag makes up for it. This game does a really great job of giving you an accurate feeling of speed. You'll quickly be immersed into the world and totally reliant on quick reactions to save your life. If you are a fan of games like Bit Trip, Audiosurf, Race the Sun I highly recommend T.E.C 3001 for you.Heres my first impressions of the game if you prefer video format.

I relay like the game and look forward the second part which is announced (indirectly) in the credits. The first 20 levels are pretty easy but not boring, the next 10 levels have the best balance so you have to restart sometimes (~5 times) and have a good challenge. The last 10 levels are for me my self a little too hard and frustrated me sometimes (I am very sensitive in this point :P) but I had nevertheless some fun ;DThis is my first game with this genre and I enjoyed it. I hope many others do, too! ;)Above is a link to my walkthrough about the game. Feel free to build your own opinion.			"

												This game is incredibly fun and addictive if you like the sense of speed. Be warned though, it's not a relaxing casual game. Most levels are very hard and require you to learn to manoeuvre your robot very precisely. And even then, a lot will often depend on sheer luck, and you will die dozens of times before you succeed.There is a large variety of stages, from high speed ones, to the more aerial ones where you perform numerous jumps between platforms, and so on. Some take a form of drag race, where you must time your boosts accurately, others are more open and have multitudes of paths to take through a level.The main 'campaign' has 41 levels. There are a lot of tough, frustrating moments, but strangely enough you will keep coming back to the game repeatedly to try and beat the level you're stuck on. Once you complete the campaign, you unlock several bonus levels, which, from what I played so far, seem even harder than the original campaign ones. You also have an endless run level, where you keep running and dodging obstacles for as long as you can.The game has a very nice visual style and cool electronic music. All this helps to enhance the virtual reality atmosphere the game is going for. If high speed challenging games are your thing, then give this game a try.			"

												Look at the robot run.11/10 would beat Sonic.Edit: T.E.C 3001 is basically a really hard racing game. I've enjoyed playing this game to death, but gah it can get really irritating at times. This game is one where you have to be very patient and calm because it will want to make you kill yourself at times. The visuals are awesome, the music is decent but i tend to listen to my own while playing this game, like deadmau5, it's addicting if you can get passed it being a hard game, and overall fun for someone who enjoys being challenged.There are a few issues like with glitching into the floors every once in a while, but, with me at least, I didn't have a huge issue with this.  I wouldn't suggest trying to get all the achievements unless your like me, a dedicated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I need one more achievement to have them all but I was about to throw my laptop trying to get the last one. haha it'll probably be more fun to just play the game rather than trying to get the achievements. It may just raise your blood pressure depending if you can handle it or are good enough to do it. For a few dollars, I think this game is worth buying just for a little fun when you need a break from the other games you play.			"

												You take control of a Robot in this high speed running game. Each level you try to race through as fast as you can picking up as many Batteries along the way while trying to avoid all sorts of obstacles.The adrenalin rush is just fantastic as you rush through the different levels. Not all levels are the same. Some levels are just pure rush and avoid obstacles while others have you time triggers to gain speed. Some races are free moving while others are ""lane-based"" whereby moving left and right simply switches lane.There are different modes as well and while you can try to complete the 40-ish levels with top scores you also can do an endless run which will go on until you smash into something or drop of the fast lane.The multiplayer mode is split screen though not against other online players but only against another person on the keyboard or second controller.That is also my only complaint that it seems that you cannot run against random players online.I would definitely recommend this game, giving it a 8/10 for:- simplistic yet brilliant and slick graphics- environmental colour switching in mid-race- easy controls- few but very effective special skills which can be used in combination with each other- excellent audio with the option to switch different background sounds/music- challenging but not to the point of wanting to smash and scream- adrenalin rushing fun			"

Everytime I start this game up, I end up playing longer than I intend to. The graphical style is gorgeous for how minimalistic it is, and the gameplay and controls are solid, easy to pick up, but tricky to master. This game can provide some real challenge at times, but it never feels unfair. And the music goes perfectly with the virtual world you run through.

 Positive + With accessible and addictive gameplay, running through levels using jumping, sliding and charging to manoeuvre around obstacles doesn’t begin to become stale at all in the 2 hours of playtime the game offers (time spent playing depends on your skill level)+ The game has a neat futuristic aesthetic and matching techno music to accompany you in the 41 fast-paced single-player levels+ Personally, I feel that the game has a perfect difficulty curve, with the game starting off very easy, and being nicely challenging at the end; with a little patience, the hardest levels will set you back no more than 30-40 attempts (though, again, this game of course is skill-dependent, so results may vary!). Negative - While the graphical quality isn’t bad at all, the lack of distinct environments to run and jump through is a little disappointing. Verdict “Considering the game originated from the Xbox Live Indie Games service, T.E.C. 3001 manages to hold up as a great infinite runner-style game. If you enjoy fast-paced and challenging platforming mixed with a solid soundtrack, then this game is definitely one to check out.” 7.5/10 TJBs  "

It's got the guitar hero effect where you feel awesome when you understand how to do everything in a level perfectly.Also it's super cheap, for $4 this game is more than worth it, you'll get hours of fun out of this arcadey runner platformer.Thank you Best Friends Zaibatsu for shining a light on this amazing game!

												T.E.C. 3001 is a fast pased platformer which promises fast pased gameplay and heart pounding soundtrack but will you want to play this ? You play as TEC a highly advanced robot which is send Virtual space to collect energy for humanity. So how is this game ? I highly suggest you buy this game. Now the game is played like a third person platformer and it works quite well. You mix between a grid level where it plays like temple run and then you have a drag level where you need to hit boost to make it to the exit in time and then theres a free roam level where you controll where you go. Overall the game is really fluid and its alot of fun to play. Graphiclly the game looks great and one of the best indie games ive seen one steam in a while. The game also has quite a good difficulty curve it gets harder as it goes.But there are a few bad things as well. Even though it might sound like a lot theres only 41 stages and a few bonus ones as well but its quite short but theres a sequel in development. Its alot of fun and i suggest you buy it and its worth the full price. I give T.E.C. 3001 an 8/10			"

												It's a strange thing.  I played around 45 minutes and took a hiatus.  After coming back, it just feels so dull, like something is missing.  It's not awful by any means, but it's failing to light that spark of interest and excitement.  After a bit of considering, I think it's because it feels less like a racing or speedrunning game and more like a fast-paced puzzle game.  Your speed is pretty much determined for you, the tracks are narrow and restrictive, and the mechanics are too shallow to allow anything beyond following the instructions and laid-out collectibles and pre-set best route.  The audiovisuals don't help much either, with a bit of a cheap presentation to them, even with the minimalistic virtual theme.			"

												The game is good, for it's price, it offers just enough entertainment. If you are like me, you'd probably find the experience starts getting stale just halfway into the game, but that's just a personal opinion.The reason I'm marking this down though is because the game is missing a very vague feature, the ability to time a double jump, shortly after pressing the jump key you have to press it again to double jump, if you wait too long then you automatically lose that ability, this might not seem like much but it actually closes off a lot of possible fun and interesting maneuvres and is quite frankly infuriating.

												While similar to Temple Run, Sonic Dash, Subway Surfers, and Minion Rush,  I had much more fun with T.E.C. 3001! A great run/dodge game with challenging levels, clean and crisp graphics, awesome soundtrack. Its a cool game that one can play very quickly.   T.E.C. 3001 is as if Temple runner, Tron, and Terminator had a kid and decided to let it run free until the end of time. The metal dude himself is very cool looking.  If Terminator, Metallo, Silver Surfer, and Iron man got married and had a child, it would be this cool looking dude. Look at him, he looks so similar to them. Sounds like polygamy, but thats what it looks like, if men were to give birth to children.If you ever enjoyed dodging stuff in temple runner, and other runner games, you'll definitely like what the Endless mode has to offer, as it is nearly identical in feel; three lanes, near instant switching between them, and obstacles that you have to jump over, slide under or just plain avoid, for the rest of your freaking life. If it’s ever on sale, total steal. The only things i dont like is that the controller seems to not work unless i unplug and plug in the controller in the settings window that appears when i first open up the game, and i dont like how it crashes when i die too quickly			"

												The fact that this game is 3D makes it sooo much harder than other running games, it is painful!There are two modes: free running and lane running. Lane running is awesome until obstacles start to obscure your view...that makes it impossible to prepare for the next move, so you'll only have a split second to make the right decision. Do I jump, dodge, duck or stay in the air? Oops, too late...Free running is where the spatial awareness problems kick in real hard. You often have to make diagonal jumps, high jumps, descending jumps.....I guess you're supposed to calculate the arc of each jump...it didn't work out too well for me.Turning lanes are a nightmare as well. If you don't steer yourself perfectly, you're guaranteed to fly off the lane. It becomes a grind to get through every checkpoint after a while.If I managed to reach the end of a more complex level, it was through pure luck, never skill. This soured the experience for me beyond repair. It's too bad, because the feeling of speed is really good in this game, as well as the sound. The visuals were fine, but like I said...I couldn't spot the next obstacle in time if my view was obstructed, if I was moving diagonally, or if there was a large height difference between lanes. Perhaps a more zoomed out camera could have helped my situation...I'm more used to sidescrolling runners, which are much easier to navigate.I wish I could upvote this game, but I had no fun with it whatsoever :( "

												You get what you pay for with this one. Turning both while running and in the air feels too heavy. The timing for double jumping feels off. GUI did not feel cohesive with having little to no options in game and having game settings outside the game before you launch it. It has a repetitive visual theme with the only minimal options to change its color.This game type has the potential to be good both in experience and in replay value. Add some banking turns or half pipes. Change the theme to running in a forest or the surface of a lake. Freedom of movement is somewhat an illusion with this game. So it can almost be said that because of the minimal effort taken on polishing this game for the PC that this game is not worth the cost.With game modes like endless run it would be good to have something like a mp3 player in the background because the in game music gets old fast.Wait for a sale to get this one if you are interested.

												This game is cool, i like the style and the theme and all, but i have been feeling some frustrations with it.When i am in the air, it randomly chooses wether my boost or double jump should work or not. (You can keep boosting constantly in this game, but for some reason when i'm in the air it doesn't boost half the time, causing me to have to restart from the last checkpoint and do the same thing until it works) This causes every free running levels to be a nightmare if i choose to pass the obstacles the way that they were built (ex jumping over or between a wall rather than avoiding it by going around) But the difficult paths are the only ones that actually give me any enjoyment, bypassing all the obstacles is simply boring.In the little time that I have played it, this issue of the game being unresponsive (which is not a problem with my controls, they work with every other game) has caused me to be infuriated beyond belief. Apparently most people have not been experiencing this (because everyone else seems to love this game) but be prepared if you choose to buy it.			"

												If you like endless runners, T.E.C. 3001 is perfect for you. It's not really endless, but the gameplay is similar--run around at ridiculous speeds collecting stuff and avoiding obstacles. It's a simple concept done well. The controls are extremely responsive, and it's not all just the same thing. There are 3 level types. One where you have full control of T.E.C.'s movement, one where he's on 3 tracks, audiosurf style, and one where you have to just go straight and boost when needed. This manages to keep it fresh enough to stop you from getting bored. There's a ton of levels and it can get pretty challenging. For the price, there's no reason that you shouldn't buy this game.			"

Some levels are worse designed than others, but the good ones you'll want to play over and over again. 3 modes of gameplay make this very unique. There's a line race, drag race, and a free runner.

												I see some people comparing this game to Audiosurf. And i think that is exactly what it is. It's a running simulator based around momentum. I'll make a list because not a lot of people like long reviews:Pro's:-Nice soundtrack-Nice feeling of speed-Great visuals-Great level design Cons:-Lack of online co-op(would be awesome <3)-Kinda short(can be forgiven seeing the price)-Is quite bland(it is a runner, thats it.)Final verdict: 7.5/10Its a nice game for a few hours of entertainment. It's definently worth checking out, in sale or not.			"

												Another adveture with another ""running"" game. It's really simply - you just run, as fast as you can (and sometimes as slow as you can), collect batteries and reach ends of level. It's not just running: there are level when you are flying and spend most of your time jumping from place to place. Start easy but later you will find some really annoying levels: like there is one with over9000 platforms forming stairs, or place where you will really calculate your jump because if you won't, you will simply fall. How fast is this game? Really fast. Like, imagine you are running the fastest you can BUT there is more. You can use something like turbo, which will make you run even faster - for a short time but nothing stops you from spamming up arrow.There are only two things I can have some complains - desing looks rather dull, even with thing that changes color of surroundings but that's just my opinion, maybe someone fill find it more fitting for a game like T.E.C. 3001. Another thing is issue with achievements - they are unlocked only once, when you will close your game. It's really minor, so if you don't really care about time which you unlocked each achievement, then there is no problem.It's fun game, as long as you like to simply run. If you get bored with playing levels, you can always try local multiplayer (friends needed, but there is nothing that can stop you from trying to play as both players alone) or marathon, which is most fun part of game. T.E.C. 3001 is cheap game, so you will pay not so much at sales, and I think it's worth this price.			"

												Good enough game, 0 storyline, 53 missions and 1 endless run map, roughly takes 4 hours to complete all missions, there are 3 main game types, general running and jumping, stuck to set lines running and jumping and speed boost rounds where you try to beat the clock rather then just picking up batteries. Overall i found this game to be very average it just reminded me of one of the games you get for free on your cell phone but even so it was still fun not very challenging but fun. Basic idea behind the game is not to work out some secret path or some puzzle but merely time everything perfectly for the best score. 5/10			"

												T.E.C. 3001 is a indie game than came out on xbox live and then got ported to pc , all in all it's a good port and a great game.Your objective is to collect energy batteries along a course at high speeds while aiming to get max ranks in each course in order to satisfy your completionist dreams.There's 3 kinds of courses , one where you can take whichever path you want , one where you just straightforward while matching the timing to gain increase speed at some points , and one where you constantly switch between 3 fixed lanes.To sort your obstacles you can double jump , dash , run at extreme speed, begin sky diving and do a super jump, the graphics are ok but not great , but the sensation of max speed is really well done specially in first person mode.You probably won't finish the game because of how irritating how levels can be but if you see it on a sale/bundle , don't doubt it grab it for a few hours of fun and vertigo.

												Despite its deceptively simplistic graphics, this game offers a very solid experience that gives you far more bang-per-buck than you'd expect.TEC 3001 is a simple runner game; you have no control over throttle, but you can jump, slide, and sometimes turn. It features a small variety of modes, ranging from the familiar three-line obstacle course (in finite or infinite flavours), to key-press timing challenges, to a 'vanilla' parkour mode, Being someone who enjoys Race the Sun quite a lot, this game was right up my alley,While, except for the 'endless mode', the game is not procedural, it nevertheless offers a nice range of levels that ramp up in difficulty very smoothly, ensuring that you are rarely left unchallenged as you fine-tune your skills. Each level feels just challenging enough and completing them is always satisfying. However, at least so far, I have found very few areas that have caused genuine frustration in me, and none that utterly made me abandon the game in dispair.As one would expect from such a simple game, there are no bugs or other issues to really speak of.The soundtrack is also pretty damn great.

												Got a spare $4?Throw it at this game... once you get used to the controls... what jumps you can/can not make and past the first 5 or so levels it becomes one constant adrenaline rush. 20 levels in and have already gotten my monies worth and more. Very good production values for such a budget title as well.Reccommended  + Feels very very fast+ Very nice simple yet clean asthetic which is pleasing to the eye, RBG 'gates' you can run through during tghe level insures the visual stay fresh with simple pallett swaps.+ Lots of weight to the controls+ Incredible level design with multiple, well thought out paths.+ 3 different game modes which get swapped out during the campaign keep things from getting stale+ Good music- No Online Multiplayer of any descriptionIt's very focused, its a free runner with a lot of freedom attatched to it and if that's what you want or you like the sound of that then I say the is no reason not to buy this game. For fans of free runners this essential, as someone who isn't much of a fan of most freerunners, I also say consider this purchase because it offers so much more than a fixed path... think Bit Trip Runner meets Mirrors Edge.

												If you like endless runners, T.E.C. 3001 is perfect for you. It's not really endless, but the gameplay is similar--run around at ridiculous speeds collecting stuff and avoiding obstacles. It's a simple concept done well. The controls are extremely responsive, and it's not all just the same thing. There are 3 level types. One where you have full control of T.E.C.'s movement, one where he's on 3 tracks, audiosurf style, and one where you have to just go straight and boost when needed. This manages to keep it fresh enough to stop you from getting bored. There's a ton of levels and it can get pretty challenging. For the price, there's no reason that you shouldn't buy this game.			"

												A pretty simple runner game with three kinds of game modes within a few dozen campaign levels to play on. Jump over stuff, double jump over stuff, slide under stuff, and sometimes break shtuff as you progressively get faster and faster during a level. It gets pretty exhilarating. You can even go in first-person mode to somewhat better simulate the fast.Keyboard & mouse are more in mind for this game because even if I use a controller the tutorial pop-ups show keyboard keys. Both work pretty well in the actual gameplay but some parts of the main menu don't function at all when a controller's used. Changing the simplified-graphics/resolution settings and keyboard/controller inputs can only be done from the configurations that pop-up before the actual game starts.As a runner game the objective is pretty simple; run, don't fall, don't hit anything, get to the end. If you get stopped in any way you start back to the last checkpoint hit. You start out running a bit slow so depending on the game mode you usually have to interact with green arrows in some way to get the speed going. Trying to hit the green arrows is often a challenge or the challenge. There are even red arrows that lower your speed and depending on the level they either serve as a means of progression or as an obstacle itself usually & annoyingly with little to no warning. There are a few levels where you'll be too fast to make turns, be too fast to not overshoot a small lone platform you're suppoed to jump on, etc.Three kinds of game modes within the few dozen levels here, though I don't seem to see each level categorized as such. In ""Drag"" you run in a straight line with no turning. To increase speed you're to time & press an input as soon your feet hit the speed-indicating green arrows. Mistiming completely slows you down to a degree. As you get faster it's a given that you have to make quicker judgements on what to do as upcoming obstacles close in at a much faster rate. In ""Speed"" there are three lanes you can instantly switch back and forth to going from one lane to the other as an added means of avoiding death, somewhat similar to Audiosurf's lane-change deal. In ""Free"" you're able to incredibly slowly turn left and right as you please and in these levels there are usually alternate routes you can go on as well as finding your own alternatives to dodging walls and such, hence the ""free"". These levels come in a little more variety and make up a little more than half the entire game.It's arcade-y, it ain't a big game, and it's pretty cheap.			"

												თამაში ნამდვილად არ არის ნათელი და უნიკალური ინდი იდეის მატარებელი, პროსტა რანერია, ოღონ მობილურის მაგივრად პერსონალური კომპიუტერის. აქვს მინიმალისტური, საკმაოდ ბიუჯეტური ვიზუალი და რამდენიმე ელექტრონული ჟანრის საუნდტრეკი, რომელიც თამაშის დაახლოებით 4 საათიან კონტენტზეა მორგებული. და ვითომ არაფერი, მაგრამ საქმეზე ირკვევა, რომ დეველოპერს სწორედ ესმის გეიმფლეი მექანიკის მნიშვნელობა. თამაშში არის სამი, ერთმანეთისგან სრულიად განსხვავებული სირბილის რეჟიმი, რომლებიც რამდენადაც გასაკვირი არ უნდა იყოს, ძალიან გავს პირველი და მეორე NFS Underground პრინციპს. 1. თავისუფალი სირბილი, რამდენიმე სხვადასხვა მარშუტით მიმავალ გზაზე, რომელიც საკმაოდ დინამიური და საინტერესოა 2. ვერტიკალური სირბილი სამზოლიან ბილიკზე, რომელზეც უნდა გადალახო ბარიერები და მოაგროვო ენერგია (ძალიან გავს NFS-ის Sprint რეჟიმს) 3. რეჟიმი რომელშიც მხოლოდ ერთ კონკრეტულ, ვერტიკალურ ხაზზე მირბიხართ, მარგრამ ერთდროულად უნდა გამოიყენო მოგროვილი ნიტრო და ბილიკზე დამაგრებული, ასაჩქარებელი ღილაკები, რასაც ემატება სხვადასხვა ტიპის ბარიერები და დრო რომელშიც მოცემული დისტანციაა დასაფარი. ხოლო სიჩქარე იმდენად დიდია, რომ ერთი ტურის გასვლას შესაძლოა რამდენიმე ათეული ცდა მოანდომო. სწრაფი გეიმფლეი კი ამ ყველაფერს კიდევ ერთ ძალიან მნიშვნელოვან მომენტს აძლევს ბონუსად. რამდენჯერაც არ უნდა მოკვდე, ყველაფერი ისე სწრაფად გრძელდება, რომ გაბრაზებას ვერ ასწრებ და დინამიკას ყვები, რასაც სულ სხვანაირ მუღამში შეყავხარ. თან რასაც ამ ბოლო დროს გაცილებით დიდ პატივს ვცემ, არის დინამიურათ მზარდი, ჯანმრთელი ჩელენჯის მომცემი და არა დამთრგუნველი სიძნელე. რომელიც პირდაპირ მუშაობს მოთამაშის გართობის ხარისხზე და არა ფრუსტრაციაში ჩაგდებაზე. ასე რომ თუ ხართ სირბილის, სიჩქარის, ელექტრონული მუსიკის და ""მჩატე ნარკოტიკების"" ხასიათზე შეგიძლიათ დაუფიქრებლად ცადოთ. წყარო - gameover.ge			"

												Another adveture with another ""running"" game. It's really simply - you just run, as fast as you can (and sometimes as slow as you can), collect batteries and reach ends of level. It's not just running: there are level when you are flying and spend most of your time jumping from place to place. Start easy but later you will find some really annoying levels: like there is one with over9000 platforms forming stairs, or place where you will really calculate your jump because if you won't, you will simply fall. How fast is this game? Really fast. Like, imagine you are running the fastest you can BUT there is more. You can use something like turbo, which will make you run even faster - for a short time but nothing stops you from spamming up arrow.There are only two things I can have some complains - desing looks rather dull, even with thing that changes color of surroundings but that's just my opinion, maybe someone fill find it more fitting for a game like T.E.C. 3001. Another thing is issue with achievements - they are unlocked only once, when you will close your game. It's really minor, so if you don't really care about time which you unlocked each achievement, then there is no problem.It's fun game, as long as you like to simply run. If you get bored with playing levels, you can always try local multiplayer (friends needed, but there is nothing that can stop you from trying to play as both players alone) or marathon, which is most fun part of game. T.E.C. 3001 is cheap game, so you will pay not so much at sales, and I think it's worth this price.			"

												Good enough game, 0 storyline, 53 missions and 1 endless run map, roughly takes 4 hours to complete all missions, there are 3 main game types, general running and jumping, stuck to set lines running and jumping and speed boost rounds where you try to beat the clock rather then just picking up batteries. Overall i found this game to be very average it just reminded me of one of the games you get for free on your cell phone but even so it was still fun not very challenging but fun. Basic idea behind the game is not to work out some secret path or some puzzle but merely time everything perfectly for the best score. 5/10			"

												I bought this game on sale, and i wasn't dissapointed at all, it was worth every cent of the 50 i spent on it, it has great gameplay, nice soundtrack, and smooth controls, it's pleasant to play with some music in the background when you're bored and you want to relax a bit, sure, it's not the most unique game, but it does it job for its genre.

												The main stages are a little easy and I can't in my right mind 100% the achievements of this game because a couple of the levels require no deaths and there's this certain part of one that I can't for the life of me figure out how to not die at in any way, shape, or form, but there are bonus stages that are awesome and difficult, and I'm sure with the right setup the racing your friend on the same screen could be good. Solid indie game overall.			"

												Pepsiman 2 is a good game. This game takes place in the future, where pepsi has been converted into pure energy in the form of batteries, a change to the setting that, while controversial, fits the overall theme better.			"

												I played this game for hours and hours on Xbox 360 (it was in the indie games section). I haven't played this version very long, but it controls just as well, if not better. The visuals are exactly what they need to be. Admittedly, I have a slight obvsession with all things cyberpunk/old-school virtual reality. It's just one of those games where you think you'll play for 15 or 20 minutes and end up playing for 3 hours. I plan on coming back to this game many times. Sometimes it's nice to take a break from long form games with something bite-sized. Highly recommended.			"
