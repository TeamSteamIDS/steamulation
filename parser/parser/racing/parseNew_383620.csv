												This game is very... meh. I have FSX, and that is highly recommended by me, but this is not. It is a terrible port from mobile, and the missions don't really make a lot of sense. Even though this game is less than $5, don't buy it, unless you have a seven year old. then you should consider buying it on your iPhone.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW.With joysticks now supported I can give this a thumbs up.Its a fun little flight game. Not really a simulator. Plane Physics are no the best bur doing the missions are fun. The ground textures could use some work though. Id rather have a basic flat texture than pixelated satillite views.ORIGINAL REVIEWWhy no joystick Support?!?!   I really wanted to like this simplistic Flight Simulator. I play super sims like DCS FSX and ROF  this game would have been awesome to play on my laptop but i cant use my joystick!  I know its a mobile port but come on!  I wish i liked playing sims on mobile but i really dont.. its no fun without a joystick.. PLEASE fix this! This would be a great little sim.			"

												This is a unique flight simulator game.  If you're looking for the next X-Plane look elsewhere.  This is more of a casual game with a good amount of plane variety.  I have all of the flight sims and even though this one is very basic, it does offer the most detailed view of Las Vegas I've seen.  The hotels are pretty neat to fly by and look pretty close to their counterpart.  If this was $10 I'd say pass on it, but for $3.99 it's worth checking out...especially great for the children if you have them.			"

												Unplayable. Terrible game. I tried using a joystick and crashed before even getting off the ground!! I've spent $2.99 on better things like crappy coffee.			"
