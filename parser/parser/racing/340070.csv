Basic InformationTitle:  Battle Ranch: Pigs vs PlantsDeveloper:  PlayboomPublisher:  PlayboomGenre:  CasualGeneral ImpressionAs much as I wanted to find a redeeming point for Battle Ranch, sadly I could not. The interface and graphics seem like a cheap Plants Vs Zombies rip-off and the annoyingly repetitive sounds make it a challenge to play even through one hour. I could not withstand two. It tries to add some tower defence flavoring of its own but fails miserably. Sure, it’s cheap and has Cards and Achivements. I would still have a hard time recommending it since a game has to provide some form of entertainment, right? Not this one…Strong Points+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Almost copy-pasted gameplay and interface.- Repetitive sounds.Rating 4/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												PvZ with boars instead of zombies. I run it at 1280x720 in windowed mode and I find the graphical assets to be just fine, they more then get the job done.Yes PvZ is a more polished game but if you are looking for more of the same vs hairy pigs... this is your huckleberry lads!If you're on the fence on this one just wait for a sale, with the card drops it probably pays for itself.

Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants is not a terrible (I would say ""poor"" instead) game by any stretch of the imagination, but it provides little unique to add to the Tower Defence formula, not to mention the established kings of the genre. It's cheap so you can give it a try, but do not expect much.			"

												Battle Ranch is basically ""Plants Vs Zombies"" but with a few added perks and a better seeding system. I personaly like the way you grow seeds/collect plants instead of sunlight and you have livestock you may grow/sell.This 1$ game was crashing my 1000$ Video Card...			"

												I do not know many games that tried to emulate and challenge the original master of the line tower defence, Plants vs. Zombies (PvZ). Battle Ranch takes the same basic principle and, frankly, merely does it again. They should have at least made the turrets something else than fruits. Still, there are some differences for its own merit.Every level throws a bunch of different zomb... uh, I mean freaking boar vikings at the ranch and you have to defend it by planting defensive turrets. There are both fast-loading pea shooters and burst turrets with longer reload-times, turrets with slowing capabilities, debuffers and outright defensive plants that block enemy movement or projectiles from hitting your plants. There are single-use items like bear traps and different area-attack bombs all the way to the slowly replenishing banana missile silo. Mobs sometimes drop special single-use items as well. Defences are no real innovation in tower defence but adequate enough.There is a good variety of different enemies from the basic grunt through more enduring varieties to ones with special abilities like flying, fast moving capabilities or tunneling under everything. There are several tanks too. Alas, within these special capabilities the boars do not differ more - every boar of a certain special type looks and behaves always exactly the same way. It would have been nice to see some variation or maybe stronger or weaker types of the specific specialities. However, noting that almost all the game graphics files are plain images, some crazy graphics mods might become available in time.Different from PvZ the six-row field is divided into two separate parts: the garden and the turret field. Field hosts your defensive capabilities while in the garden you play a constant mini-game of planting and harvesting fruit for score that's used to buy turrets. There are 18 different garden plants, one for each turret type. They differ from each other with their reharvesting times and score production rates, and in addition few of them have to be replanted after harvesting. You get a full score (i.e. a star) from a level if you harvest all of the fruits required by the level.One thing that's nice is that you don't have to click every single fruit you harvest - simple slide by the mouse cursor is enough. However, annoyingly enough the frame rate appears to be locked to 15 FPS, resulting in clunky animations. Also, the PC port (Battle Ranch was originally a phone/tablet game) has merely one resolution available, which is a huge oversight. The early levels are also super-easy so I'd wish there was a turbo button to speed things up. That or it should generally be slightly faster paced. Also, you can't redo levels: you have to play through the whole thing again if you miss a star for that season perfection achievement.The story mode has 50 levels divided into five seasons (the regular ones + unpredictable) plus a couple of special levels for each season. The only differences between the regular seasons are the fruits and the obstacles that you have to clear to fill the whole garden: grass, stones, tree stumps and snow are just reskins of the same stuff, as are the ""tools"" required to clear/harvest them. In the unpredictable season and bonus levels between stages some special effects can affect the garden and your plants, like rain grows more grass to block the garden (minor annoyance) or localized tornados destroy plants in random locations. Unpredictable season is clearly the most challenging (and suitably, the last one) of the otherwise easy story seasons.After story you can hurl yourself into the bonus games and mini games: there's a pure gardening mode and a long defence mode with several stages of enemies with the same fruit defenders. It's a shame there were often just one or two levels of the more intriguing mini games like the one where the field is filled with treasure chests, each one containing either a boar or a weapon to use againts them, a click opening the surprise. Myself, I found the puzzle levels of Boarmania the most interesting, for in those the roles are reversed: you are given a set amount of boars and you have to destroy the gardens behind rows of defensive plants. There were 15 levels of these but I wouldn't have minded having more.Like any farming game, this one also has a silly garden for you to waste hours with. Any garden plants can be planted there with a set fee and you'll get some money for the plants thus harvested. This is probably the most viable way to get the two grindy achievements (get 1 million dollars and harvest 100000 fruits). Fortunately, you can hire a slow-walking but tireless farming gnome to do the harvesting for you and let the game run on the background while you play something else. Nevertheless, it's still going to take a lot of time if you want them. I've effectively AFKed some 50 hours of my game time and silently grinded the fruits in the background while actually hacking away at knights or ruling vast kingdoms elsewhere. Oh, and there's also a barn with potential (and quite expensive) cows and chickens and stuff but I figured it was a waste of grinding time to grow chow for animals (unintentional shout-out to vegetarianism).In effect, there's about 30 hours of real playing involved. I'd call it Above Average and in my opinion it's worth its list price of 7 euros especially if you loved PvZ, maybe about half that if tower defence still tickles your fun bones. The oversights in porting it to PC dull the outlook, though the devs have said they are at least looking into the resolution matter. Modding might make it more interesting even though there's no Steam Workshop at the time or (AFAIK) planned out.If you're sceptical whether you'd like it, there's a demo on the game's Steam Store Page. Initially I tried it and was satisfied to buy it at launch, but it's also a good way to see whether you can put up with the resolution, clunky animations and the similarities to PvZ. It's convenient that you can continue the full version from where you were left in the demo.			"

												Riddled with bugs.1. Game crashes every hour to exception errors2. natural disaster-department attacks still produce sound effects, even when muted3. game scene during loading sometimes doesn't skip when mouse clicks4. World 5 trophy unlocked with perfect stars didn't unlock with all 10 golden stars.  Granted, I killed the final boss before harvesting 99 pineapples, but the game still shows a gold star unlock for the game because the level auto-ended. Where's my achieve?The game is short. Don't buy my game time. That's all spent farming for gold for animal expansions. That's just for fun, by the way. I can't see how spending 200,000 gold on doubling my cow space would ever see a return. ROIs are rediculous in this game.The pros: This is a clone of Plants Vs. Zombies, by Electronic Arts, formerly by PopCap Studios before it was acquired by a giant. This was a Game of the Year, and one of the best games out for Steam, IMHO. I don't see how they could have ruined it the way they did. When will game developers learn to put the complexity and polish and length to games that they deserve? Why do some levels give 300 gold for clearing (btw, 200k gold for double cows), and some levels give plants? There's not enough plants. In the low-twenties versus PvZ's 50ish plants. Buy Plants versus zombies instead.			"

												Do you like Plant vs Zombies? Have you looked for a similar game? Well Battle Ranch is very much like it. The first levels you learn how to plant seed, grow plants and defend against the enemy wild boars. You get new tools as you progress through the levels, the season changes and new enemies comes with that.This PC port is decent. I noticed some low resolution textures in the introduction film but the game itself looks alright. It should be able to run on most systems. You can play it in window or fullscreen, whatever you prefer. Battle Ranch does not support 1920x1080 resolution, however I didnt have any issues with black borders or anything like that.I haven't seen everything this game has to offer yet, but from what I can tell so far the game has a lot of content, just like Plant vs Zombies (and I put over 100 hours into that game). I will update this review as I progress, but for now I can say that it's an easy buy for any tower defence or resource gathering player out there. It's cheap and fun!			"

												Honestly, the game isn't really that bad, but it is inferior to an already existing game; Plants vs. Zombies. However, it is also cheaper so that can be justified, but the game has a lot of minor problems so I can't really recommend it. Getting some of the achievements requires a lot of grinding, the micro-management feels a bit tedious and a lack of a replay feature means if you miss getting a gold star on one level, you need to replay the entire game again. It is a decent game, but it just feels bland, uninspired and overall unenjoyable to play.			"

												Shameful mobile port. Dispite gameplay idea it's nearly equal to another dumb clicker game. Gardening (and the rest) with long cooldowns and ""shopping"" seems stupid for PC version.Game starts in full-screen disregarg setting. It has long loading time when switching between battle and menu. Music is repetitive. There is no balance (it's waaay too easy). Requirements to get star for completing level seems broken. There is NO WAY to replay level to improve result, so basically it's one-shot victory or a complete replay, which is ... boring. No hotkeys, pure touching (I mean mouse clicking), even escape key doesn't bring menu to pause game when you need it.Otherwise it's a good plants-vs-zombie (with a bit different mechanic) clone.Do not recomment unless 70-80% price reducement.

Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants exemplifies how a good concept still needs to be well-handled to make a good game.  This is a blatant clone of the wildly successful Plants vs Zombies with Viking Pigs in place of the Zombies.  And it's dull.Beyond the basic and familiar plant-based lane defense segments, Battle Ranch has a bunch of additional features to offer -- animals to keep in barns, plants to grow in a greenhouse -- but you need the patience of Job to unlock any of it because the game is so horribly slow.  The attackers plod their way towards you, while your plants lackadaisically fire at them.  Every level seems to take forever.  It's slow, it's tiresome, and it's unchallenging.  Maybe after enough hours invested, Battle Ranch will pick up the pace and actually become fun.  I won't be finding out.  I've already given it a tedious hour of my life, and I don't trust it with any more.			"

												Yes, it looks just like Plants vs. Zombies, only with boar Vikings, but the gameplay is different; you still have to wait to replant something, but you also have to water them when a little blue drop appears over the seeds. There are two kinds, so far, of ""Sunflowers."" There's a fruit plant, and green peppers, both of which give points, and when enough are built up, you can place ""peashooters,"" which spit stars, and ""chili peppers"". The ""peppers"" split in three and all explode. The game is more challenging in its early levels than PvZ, although it's a pretty close clone.It is available for Linux, so we gamers can get that PopCap experience. Recommended.			"

I enjoyed how there was an attempt @ a story, but it could of been omitted alltogeather.The main issue I had was the ""Hint"" Feature. It literally is just a cheat feature that poses no penalty, at all. You could just keep using hint & doing what it suggest to fly through every level. There should be a penalty for using this, as it makes the game TOO easy.All in All, You will get many hours of enjoyment with Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants & the price is right for Bring the Vegetarian Smackdown on the Pork Chop Horde.

												I tried very hard to like this game. I have beaten Plants vs Zombies like 5 times, So I wanted something simular and thought I could settle even if this game is not as good, however there are several reason this game is unplayable to me:Delayed/Sticky Input - You often try to click things and it doesnt work, or you click on something and cant get rid of it. Also, entering my profile name was hard, it shouldnt be hard to type a string in a box.Odd Resolution Issue - The game is constantly switching resolutions, from launching the game to playing the game, there can be up to 3 changes to resolution. (It also has no resolution chooses, and the one they picked is spectaciularly low, as with many low quality games)Lacks Ummph - What I mean by this is im not connected to the story, or the units. Every plant in plant vs zombies, has some form of connection, (IE: Wall/Tallnuts cry when they are eaten) this game doesnt attempt any of this. Plus I dont want the zombies to eat my brains or my plants, but do I care about pigs raiding my farm? I guess I could become a pork farmer.Graphics - Could be better, could be worse. I find they hurt the eyes after awhile, Do not like them.TLDR - Unresponcive, Resolution issues, Bad graphics, Overall Poor. Play PVZ for the 6th time.			"

												Plants vs Viking Pigs !!Actually this one-liner might sum up Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants very well. It is a casual strategy game, highly reminiscent of the cult classic Plants vs Zombies. Since it works very well, adding some nice new touches like watering seeds you have planted to generated more seeds, which are used as currency to buy your weapon plants as well as a secondary objective of gathering a fixed amout of various seeds. Basically this is a more diverse variant of the sunflower used In PVZ.Battle Ranch plays very nice and everything works as it should. I overall recommend it to fans of PVZ that are looking for more of that kind of gameplay as well as anybody who is interested in casual strategy.			"

												Well, when I first saw the game I thought ""LOOK, A CLONE OF PLANTS vs ZOMBIES"", but yet, I wanted to give it a chance. I started playing and my first thought was ""Seems it's going to be a boring copy of PvZ"", BUT I decided to go on a little more. And more...and more... And when I saw, I've already played about 4 hours.So here's the thing:It'll never be like Plants, obviously. But still It's a good game.Plants have all the funny stuff about the worlds, and the zombies characterized, the costumes for the plants and scenery and everything, while Battle Ranch have simple characters (seems to be viking boars, I found it comic) and what changes is the weapons and armor. The only 'boar' with custom is the one that comes flying in a parachut and wearing sport clothes with boxe gloves.Unstead of plant a plant that gives sun, you have to plant plants to win points to buy the plants. And for each level, you have a sort of different plants to plant, each one with it's own time to grow and number of points. Also, you have a limited frame of slots to plant the plants, so you have to manage how much of each plant you're gonna plant and when you plant you have to give water so they can grow. It's quite a job, but at last makes the game a little more tricky. To win the gold star, you have to plant a number of the plants that gives point (not the battle plants), before the final wave. If you don't, you'll win the silver star. Believe me, sometimes it's hard to win the gold star. I just doesn't find yet how to replay this levels I didn't won the gold star, but I'll find it.Another thing I didn't have time to learn is the farm mode, so I can't tell nothing about it.I must say, it worth the cents.

												Battle Ranch is a very simple game where you plant plants that shoot at incoming enemies. There is a nice variety of different plants. It can be very addictive even though it is very simple.It is not a very good game compared to other games that are out there but I still enjoyed it enough to make it worth the tiny bit of money I paid for it.

												What is this, 1994, when the only option is to have 800x600 fullscreen game? Also, Plans vs Zombies ripoff.No settings for anything other than sound, ""tutorial"" blocks the game in non-obvious way. Why do I have to plant my resource seed in top left corner? No damage/range/speed info on any stuff.Yeah, bought for steam cards, but still.			"

												I kinda like it i guess, its nothing really new in the tower defense genre. I'd say if you like plants vs zombies then you'll like this, but I'd suggest buying it while it's on sale because, I do not believe it's worth the full price of $1.99. I got it as part of a bundle so I didn't pay the full price. I haven't played it extensively yet, and I'm not sure if I plan to.			"

												I'll get straight to the good and bad things about this gameThe good+Nice music which goes with the feel of the game+Good wallpapers given for free for both 4:3 and widescreen+A guide is available for all levels which tells you what order to place the plants and where, which is useful if you get   stuck on a levelThe bad-Animations and art are definitely not as smooth as PvZ-inconsistency with model changes. Some plants change their look when they become severely damaged, others don'tSummaryIf you want a PvZ-like game but don't want to pay ~£5 for PvZ then this game is a good choice and for less than one quarter of the price, it offers more than one quarter of the fun  (~_~)Really though this game is pretty good for the price but if you do want to play a PvZ-like game just buy PvZ.

												This game is fairly similar to Plants vs. Zombies, but has some unique aspects to it as well. Instead of planting everything in one plot for battle, there are two separate plots; one for gaining sun and the other for planting battle plants. Instead of zombies you are fighting boars that possess a variety of different weapons. Every level in the campaign offers a unique experience in that you get new plants or items available after completion. Some of the things that remained consistent between PvsZs and this game are the garden, shop, some of the battle plants, and side features that get unlocked as you play further. That said the game offers a unique enough experience that I enjoyed playing it for a while. If you are a PvsZs fan then this game would be great to get on a sale or maybe even at full price if you liked the other a lot.			"

												I wanted to finish this game before reviewing it, but it is so long (in a good way) and i\'ve already broken my os by tinkering outside of playing, but i\'ll keep you with the facts.The good :Linux supportSongs are fitting, although alittle boring compared to PVZ\""Sunflowers\"" Have no cost, so you don\'t need to extent before placing towersThere\'s objectives like getting X of a seed, Y of other... Those give you stars and some mo\', starts only really serve for trophies so far.Plants for the most part aren\'t just reskinsFully moddable, as all image files aren\'t compressed, you can put anything on place of em!Plants actually have hp, compared to pvz1 that anything below wallnut/pumpkin would die in like 3 secondsA guide for every level, although only around placement, still helpful.The bad:It\'s really picky wether or not you\'ll hit a button on menu/place a plant, sometimes you need to click that in around 3 different spots, kinda bothering.There\'s not really a good instruction on the end, plants \""Biography book\"" aren\'t very helpful on explaining, nor gives any info around what they actually do.Trophies may be glitched and not give you any achievment on steam.As far as PVZ-ish games go, some plants get useless quickly (Like the carrot missile.)No punsNo fast forward buttonSome things don\'t really make sense (Plants are reffered as weapons, and apparently they have a spirit/soul)Not many screen resolutions to choose fromALWAYS launches at fullscreen, even if windowded.Overall : It\'s decent, above average for the price you get this on a sale, has linux support, that\'s about it, it\'s a buggier pvz with linux support, although some things are original, i recommend if you liked pvz, but can\'t use windows/mac, or just wants trading cards for proffit.

												Alright, so to be fair, I managed to nab this game for free from galagiveaways, however I'll try my best not to let that influence my review by any means.The game comes across as being a PvZ clone based on what you'd see, but there's actually a lot of differences that made it stand out to me. First and foremost, you can't just plant down your growth plants and expect them to instantly generate your resources. You end up having to water them first, which adds to another level of management, aside from placement of defenses. In addition to that, there appears to be a mechanic that involves collecting a certain number of fruit or vegetables from those plants in order to get a star for each level, though to be honest I'm not entirely sure what that adds aside from a sense of completion.The watering mechanic seems to come further into play during later stages of the game from what I can tell, and... Well, actually makes for an interestingly frantic gameplay compared to the relatively slow looking animation of the pigs you're fighting. There's a lot to keep track of at once, but it never feels too disorienting, just... Like there's a lot to do and keep track of which is actually pretty good.So, if I can edit, I will once I get further into the game, I'm only up to the level at which the player can unlock the greenhouse, so please bear with me for now. The greenhouse is about what you'd imagine from similar games, allowing the player to generate some coins and... In my opinion being a rather fun gameplay mechanic, but more likely than not that opinion stems from my appreciation of idle/incremental gaming.So far, I'd give this game a 7/10, it's not perfect, the animations feel somewhat awkward in places and the art style isn't necessarily the most pleasing, but the gameplay itself is really solid and it's definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of similar games. Seriously though, it feels like there's a lot of content I'm missing, all things considered, so it's safe to say it's pretty packed with enough to keep you entertained for a while.Thank you for reading if you did, and sorry for this being so drawn out.

												Ok usually these plants vs zombies knock-offs are complete and utter trash but this one is actually quite good. It's basically the same concept with a few differences such as pig vikings instead of zombies, yes that's right I said PIG VIKINGS, also in addition to simply not being killed by the pig vikings you need to produce a certain number of each crop to earn a gold star for the level; crops are basically your sunflowers in this game, they produce food which gives you points to make weapon plants. There are also obstacles in the game such as rocks and grass that you need to get rid of in order to plant more crops. If you are sick of playing the same old plants vs zombies over and over like I was then I recommend this game.			"

												VIKING BOARS?! Battle Ranch : Pigs vs Plants is exactly that. Much like the Plants vs Zombies games this is just VIKING BOARS. Is it as well polished? nah, but for the price and a new look on the tower defence laning game, it's definnantly one of the best adaptations out there. Puzzles and hordes of VIKING BOARS to take down with your assorted plant and vegatable warriors, its definantly one to get. Its simple to learn with a gradual difficulty in level, so you learn your vegatable warriors and the VIKING BOARS abilities as too. Get items and such in game to help you battle, along with many diffrent game types and themes, the game does have a lot to offer. Fight with diffrent plants/vegatables and against diffrent baddies in every season. Winter, fall, spring and summer. The music is kind elavator-ish but you'll be more worried on collecting your crops and what lane that next wave of VIKING BOARS is going to push through. Wish there was a codex of sorts ahaead of games just to help me get a heads up on whats going on and the baddies, and goodies. Also personaly I think pigs is more ideal to attack a farm then zombies...The artwork style on some of the VIKING BOARS (especially the BOSS, honestly one of the best baddies style wise, I'v seen in a while. ) is humurous and even on some of the vegatable warriors. Definantly can tell the Devs put some time and effort into this with a comical kick.			"

												Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants rests in a subgenre of Defense games that is most often represented by Plants vs Zombies, which I'm embarrassed to admit, I still have yet to play.  Even so, that shouldn't keep us from discussing Battle Ranch on its own merit.  Because, even though it's not a game I would have actively sought out, thanks to Epic Quest Games, I was given the opportunity to play Pigs vs Plants to create my own opinionn of a game which receives very little hype.  Having been a steadfast fan of defense games since the iconic Defense Grid: Awakening came out, Pigs vs Plants comes as my introduction to this style of defense games where you play on a game board and enemies move from one side of the field in order to destroy your resources and reach your base at the close end of the field.  It might be thought of as simpler to the full field style Defense games, but not without a similar brand of frantic pace in getting your own defenses in shape in preparation for the onslaught.  You still have different types of towers, even if they aren't upgradable, and tools to slow and stop the enemies.  The other element that isn't present in traditional defense games is how your resources are generated.  You must plant crops and harvest them, rather than generating points by killing enemies.  This adds to the exceitment by giving you the additional dimension of managing your crops.  Not only are there a number of towers at your disposal, this is also a pretty good variety of tools, and an in game store that allows you to buy tools, unit slots, and other things that come in useful to help you fend of the enemies.When you first start the game, one of the more notable aspects is the art style.  It has a comical, fun style that is easy to appreciate, even if not ground-breaking.  I have to give credit to Playboom, an unknown developer for putting together something that is fun, challenging, is incredibly addictive, all for a remarkably low price of $1.99.If you're looking for some mindless entertainment and don't require something that represents the high bar of technology, you might just want to give Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants a try.  For all of the things that it does right ?I recommend it.  My final score is a 7/10.			"

												We all know it's a ""copy"" of a well known game. It's probably not so well implemented like the original, but it improves on several aspects of it (so far, it might have fallen short of other aspects, still have to play the game more). If you have a few bucks on your account, this a game I'd recommend because it will give you hours of fun for your money (which is not so common nowadays, unfortunately)			"

												Let's put it like this: I haven't played Plants Vs Zombies. I've only seen a little bit of it. So my opinion isn't going to be ""this $1 game is worse than that $20 one"" or whatever.That being said, I just did not enjoy this game. It's excessively slow, and the first levels were so cakewalk-y that it completely sapped the fun out of it.			"

												Pros: -Authentic artwork and not stolen/bought assets. (Give credit where credit is due) Unfortunately that's as far as I got because:Cons:-SLOWEST GAMEPLAY I'VE EVER SEEN. It's not laggy or anything, it's just set 400% slower than a defence game should be.-Music is 10 second loops, and it never seems to change. Ever.-Mini-games last WAY TOO LONG.-Low res menu.Do I recommend it? No.Do I think people should condemn it for being a pvz ripoff? Not a chance, you knew what ytou were in for when you bought a $1 game.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Tower defence game.Interface/Menu/SettingsIntro video is cartoony Drawn.Main Menu music is Okay.There is a Music volume slidebar available.There is a Sound volume slidebar available.You are able to play the game in fullscreen mode or windowed mode.Fullscreen and windowed mode nearly have the same screen size.There are no resolution sizes available.There are some different languages available.About the game.If you are familiar with ""Plants VS Zombies"" Then you will most likely already know the game. The gameplay concept is basically the same. You will plant a seed into the ground and you will give it some water to make them grow. Once the plant has been grown you will collect their seed in order to get some Score points. The score should be spend to build a Plant Turret. In each level you have to collect a certain ammount of seeds inorder to get a star. There is also a time limit at the bottom for a star?They don't have a health bar indicator available. The only health condition that you are able to see is from their appearance.You are able to get stars in each level.It is quite boring.Animation's aren't super impressive to say the least.I have the feeling there is some lagg or delay in the game. There are video scenes.There are some Strategy guides available in-game. Which is spoiling and ruining the game as you will know where to place the Plants.Music has a bad looping.Other things.Just because there is a ""zombie vs plants"" game out there. That doesn't mean that everyone else should copy it and basically give it a graphics remix.This should be a free Flash game on Newsgrounds.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			"

												This game is just plain horrible. It is slow, uninteresting, and a bad copy paste of Plants vs Zombies. But it's super-cheap. The question is: Do you prefer to pay a few euros for an interesting game really worth playing to, or a few cents for a shear loss of your precious lifetime? The background story is that viking wild boars are invading some land, and there is no one to defend it but vegetables. Sounds exciting. The game is made of a giant courtyard, and you can plant your vegetables (which come in various kinds, just like there are various towers in a tower defense game, which tis one basically is) on rows. Your foes will attack these rows, so you have to defend everyone of them to keep the enemies from coming. In the backyard you can make some vegetables growing to win some kind of money. You have to plant their seeds and pour water in them once, it's quite boring. What really kills the game is the pace. The first few minutes you just have to wait until your vegetables grow. Then the waves start coming but they are very slow in their moves. It's so boring that it's hard not being distracted away from your screen (by the wall next to you, for instance, which is so much more interesting). Even if you cannot waste your money in this almost free game, and that makes the developers pretty fair, you will waste your time and this is far worse. Note: I am not a fan of Plants vs. Zombies and that may be influencing my review. Still, I played it, and I spent easily half an hour on it without feeling the urge to play something else.  "

												I got a free key of this game, and I think for it's price it is quiet okay. the only thing that a really hated that it doesn't support higher screen resolutions like for my 4k monitor. The game itself is like plants vs zombies, and the best is you can edit all plants, boars and so on in the editor, e.g. you can give your plant 100 power and reduce its reloading time and all that things. Quiet cool thing, but if you change to much the game will be to easy and there is no challenge at all anymore.			"

												This game, as you probaly guessed from the title, is an new kind of version of the old popular game ""Plants VS Zombies"". I can't remember how much i gave for this game, but if you liked Plants VS Zombies, there's a big chance of you liking this game too. IF NOT YOU HATE WANNABE GAMES.The pros and the opposite of the pros is kinda the same whether or not you liked Plants VS Zombies. The music is very much like Plants VS Zombies with some other tones and stuff like that. The story is almost the same, with that diffrent that now it is Viking Pigs who wants you dead and not Zombies. So if you like this game or not comes up to if you liked Plants VS Zombies or not. I'm very confused of this game, and i don't think it can be more than maximum 2 hours of fun gameplay until it starts boring you.			"

In case you are a Trading Card junkie like meThis game's Trading Cards are bugged. Some foil trading cards are in short supply to the point of none available on the store. I previouly thought it meant the cards were bugged; however, I have come to understand it is just a low supply of cards. For example you will be unable to purchase the foil Cactus Holder. This means it is impossible to get the Foil Badge for this game at the moment. On the flip side, if you don't care about badges and only selling cards this might be a great opportunity.The cards for this game are:Boss Boar bugged zero sellersCactus Holder bugged unlistedRocket BoarSkate Board Boar bugged zero sellersTurnip Mine bugged unlistedSoul Axiom has the same problem (if going for badges) / opportunity (if trying to get rare cards) by the way.

												A clone of ""plants vs zombies"" with a new enemy and some smaller gameplay changes. The style is less cute and more cool-ish. The game plays very similar to plants vs zombies. If you like the original you will like this one too. It has some nice video sequences to introduce new level changes. The only negative thing I noticed was that some of the graphics seemed pixelated through size shrinking, but it's a very minor complaint.

												What is Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants? If you are familiar with Plants vs. Zombies, then you should know that this game is the same, only it's pigs vs plants. Plus added some more features and is a bit harder than plants vs zombies. If you don't know what this game is about, I'll tell you. This is  strategy, tower defense and time management  game. Some achievements are hard to get but I still enjoyed this game. Took me 60 hours to get all achievements but if you don't want them, then it will take approximately 20 hours with story mode and gamemodes. Pros +Story+Interesting game modes Cons -Almost the same as PvZ and it's like copy of it-Some achievements are too hard to get Overall I enjoyed this game but PvZ is way much better.

												** I received this game for free for my honest review **This is a fun take on the Plants vs Zombies game. It looks and plays good for a budget game.  There are several different modes to play although I've only played one so far.  I find this to be quite fun and even at the full price of $1.99 it's well worth it in my opinion.As I play more and try other modes. I'll update this if I find reason to.EDIT:  In this game you don't directly choose the weapon (plant) you are going to use next. You click a button and it randomly selects one ala slot machine. Some may not like that but I did. It made longer planning slightly more difficult and made for a little more frantic game play.			"

												Decent game and funny aesthetic, but the game runs at a very low framerate, and a lot of UI decisions just don't make sense.			"

												Yes, this is a blatant Plants vs. Zombies rip off. You liked PvZ? You'll proably get some good times out of this. It's quite fun, easy at the start and gets harder later, just as it's supposed to. Considering how cheap it is (even cheaper on sale and in a bundle) it's definitely worth getting. And since most people seem to complain about frame rates... I had no trouble with that o.o			"

												This game is basically a plants vs zombies clone but with pigs instead of zombies. Fairly good game for the price tag. Basically the resolution is not the best. There is a plants area and an area to defend from the pigs. Get it when it's on discount on within a bundle. But even for 90 cents if you enjoyed plants vs zombies, why not? I got it as part of a bundle and this games price was down to like 10 cents or something. Purchase was more or less worth it			"

												What is Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants? If you are familiar with Plants vs. Zombies, then you should know that this game is the same, only it's pigs vs plants. Plus added some more features and is a bit harder than plants vs zombies. If you don't know what this game is about, I'll tell you. This is  strategy, tower defense and time management  game. Some achievements are hard to get but I still enjoyed this game. Took me 60 hours to get all achievements but if you don't want them, then it will take approximately 20 hours with story mode and gamemodes. Pros +Story+Interesting game modes Cons -Almost the same as PvZ and it's like copy of it-Some achievements are too hard to get Overall I enjoyed this game but PvZ is way much better. I rate Battle Ranch: Pigs vs Plants  6/10  "

												Plants vs. Zombies? Sure, a cheap copy. And undoubtedly it's not my kind of game, learn how to plant seed, grow plants and blablabla...that crap. Slow game and without graphical options. Definitely not.			"

												(Little test review)Very nice little game to spend some left-over minutes for 1 or 2 or 5 rounds or so.Testing for the Steam Client Beta : Some-one posted the [list][*]*.*[*] *.* [/list]commands to show a bulleted list from a (not sure) game review in a profile showcase do not work properly.  Person used the word ""evalluation"" so i'm guessing it's about a game review. person used the wording ""on profile"" so i'm guessing it's about the game review showcase. Person has his/her profile set to private so the above can not be checked from there. person wrote something about using a . (dot) in front of a sentance but that was not realy clear to me either. Therefore  . I write some nonsence here following a . . . I write some more nonsence here following a . . . I feel i need to write even more nonsence here following a . . .At the risk of spamming i quit writing nonsence after this sentence following a . . And what about the other BBcodes?
