												I do not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 8. There is little to no challenge even on the highest difficulty, the voices are dreadfully squeaky and annoying and the music is barely tolerable. I bought this game for 29 cents and I still feel as if it was a complete waste of money.			"

												This game reminds me a lot of games I used to play on other consoles.. It is a 90's game when they created a lot of these games ... still nice to play with your friends. Although no servers cause no one still plays it but you can do a LAN server or singleplayer.Nice game6.5/10-Diesel			"

												This is an evolution of the human race. Only in my dreams have I witnessed slimy gumballs sloshing around in different gamemodes! Don't even get me started on the only server! It's the best server you can imagine, based in the czech republic. If I went on this review would be at least 4 pages long. BUY THIS NOW!!!UPDATE: The game really is just a mediocre flash game that you have to pay for. Has frame rate drops, buy this for your friend, not yourself. You're not missing anything. Pros:Kinda fun at timesCons:Too easyBroken Multiplayer (I started my own server and couldn't even join)Framerate dropsJust noUPDATE # DOS: I recently made a steam group for this game, join if you want!!

												Gumboy Tournament is a inexpensive game to seep your time into for a few minutes each day or if you've nothing else to do/play. In this game, you are a racing gumball(I know, right?) and you go through many levels and different kinds of races(which are basically just the same 9-10 levels repeated over and over again, slowly becoming more challenging) to earn trophies. Basically, you use your mouse to move and fire your gumball in different directions. The AI is pathetic, so most all of the races are easy, and you'll beat each in roughly 1-3, depending on how far you are. The graphics are livable, but they're not that great and make the game look flat. The game does have multiplayer, although I have not personally tried it out since no one has made a server in a good few years, but I imagine that it would have the same gameplay as the singleplayer.In short, this is a relatively fun, casual game to spend your free time on when you've only got a minute or so and you've run out of dragons to kill. The multiplayer however has been dead for several years now though, so only play for singleplayer or with friends. $3 is too expensive for this game, seeing as of how you can easily buy this game on sale for $.29. Rating: 6/10: the game is fun for the price I paid, but is mostly uninspired.			"

												Obviously you must realise the art work that lies deep inside the game. It's deep inside the subconscious of a young child in pre industrial America where you are forced to thrive off of others in a anarchy like goverment, yet being deep in the past the gumboys predict the future with movements and smiles. What lies in the cores of gumboys is something that is deep and dark that is covered up with looks of pleasuring happiness...you must find this out on your own. Only you can learn the secret art of the gumboy. Find it... "

												""Game of the Year 2006!"" - A very very dismal year. This game has it all: horrendous optimization, the tinniest voices my ears will never hear again, the disgusting artwork, and o top it all off I bought this game twice, I want my $0.88 back and all 31 minutes of my life back. 10/10 would hang myself with my laptop charger before getting this game for free. Thinking back on this, I do wish I killed myself before playing this atrocious pile of code called a ""game"".			"

												Being trained as a professional Flying Fox at the ""Military University of Foxes and Kitsunes"" and having 150 confirmed potion victims i can honestly say that this game is one hell of a game.It is hard, even for me, to roll that constant through the world like those marble like creatures. Trust me, that actually was part of our basic training, they are just too pro for me.Although it is offered at steam our Scientist team lead by very talented Doges (it is hard to find good quality Fox personal nowadays) has found out that you can actually get the 1.8 release of  Gumboy at CNET download legaly FOR FREE.(source: Gumboytournament.com)It is said that their Headquarter is in the Szech Republic and that their only connection to the glorious Fox connection (and no, we do not own Fox TV) does not work for anybody and that the named server probably is almost down. But thanks for everything there is a Campset orderable for free to set up your own Military Base (server).The commentator of the Game is none other than the famous superstar Squeeky Mc Squeek, also known for one of the voice actors from the Chipmunks Series and many many other quality internet videos.Rumours say, that you can gather the all mighty power of his voice by inhaling Helium. And no: That is not how we Foxes sound.One of our researchers has also made a small visit to the culture of the GumboysIt appears that they like to race against each other who gets the fasted amount of Diamonds and can sell those for 50,100 and 200 Fox$ers to our intergalactic Organisation.When they  shall not do so, they try to steal the Flagg of their other Nation and bring it to their own Flag.Apparently they do not like each other and have always to show which is the best Nation.The Gumboys got named one of the most fabulous Creatures 2006 by the russian dancing men organisation ""Gametunnel"".We blame the capitalist pig!

												Gumboy Tournament is the multiplayer version of Gumboy: Crazy Adventures. You're a gumboy, which is basically a ball that can stick to surfaces, also the gumboy is able to jump.Your goal in the game is to collect more diamonds than your opponent does. You can play vs bots, local vs a friend or online. Mind you though, there probably won't be any player online to play.Gumboy Tournament is a neat party game, especially for kids but you probably get bored with it pretty quickly. The game is cheap (normal price: 2 bucks, in a steam deal it could be 0,30 cents) which is the right price for the game but in my opinion it's not enough to recommend this game.  "

What's unique about Gumboy Tournament is that it's not a linear, move-from-the-left-of-the-screen-to-the-right-of-the-screen platformer in the vein of Super Mario Bros.

Product received for free
												So I have a tale to tell about my experience procuring Gumboy Tournament.It was a warm summer night, and I was walking to my local Toys R Us to check out the games . I hoped to find some hidden gems, but what I found was like discovering a brand new Ninjustu (I'm a ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village). As I enter the store, and quickly concentrate my chakra to my feet to zoom across the aisles to the game section, and see a new game ""Gumboy Tournament"" sitting on the shelf. There is only one copy left, and I see some granny about to take it, talking about how her grandson would like it. I swiftly throw my kunai at her, and then dash up and chop her in 2 with my katana. At last, this game will be my sweet salvation. I take it to the cash register, and hastily give the cashier (who happened to be a pretty female around my age) the game. She attempts to scan it, when all of a sudden, an army of grannies start charging at us as fast as the can, their walkers squeaking across the floor, as they try to get the game for their grand kids. I start doing my tiger hand signs, preparing my self for the Fireball jutsu. As I build up my chakra, I say "" I  will not let you assault m'lady in this manner ."" I cast my fireball jutsu, and burn all the vermin (to the unknowing eye, it would look like I just took out a lighter and a can of Axe™ spray, but this is just what non-believers see). I turn back to the cashier, and she gives me the now purchased game. She looks at me longingly and says ""Wanna go on a date soon?"" I look back at her, tip my fedora, and reply ""No thanks, m'lady, you aren't my type.""OVERALL REVIEW: It was alright...			"

												Lame. You play as a sticky ball that rolls along the edge of things and tries to beat other sticky balls to the objectives. It sounds lame because it is. It has local co-op, which I didn't try, but I'm sure that would still be lame. But do check out the video for this game in its Community Hub, which is hilarious.			"

												Well first up, WARNING: This game doesn't work in fullscreen, it just locks your system up.   Developers apparently didn't bother testing on anything but a junky old 1080p monitor. Artwork style in the game rating out of 10: MSPaint.   Seriously, the graphics are that bad.Gameplay:  Well it's like Wizball (kind of - instead of bouncing, you're sticky and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) from the 1980s but competitive and not particularly fun or interesting.  There's no real story mode, you just go through levels competing against other players or the AI.  You roll around the walls of the map and collect diamonds to get more points than the other guy.   In the era of Grand Theft Auto 5, Ark, The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Star Citizen, and so many other incredible games, they give us MSPaint with sticky balls.  Correction, they ask for us to pay them for sticky balls, it's not even free.  Even if it was free, you wouldn't want it.Technical stuff: Absolutely atrocious - doesn't work on modern systems.   Video options are limited to turning off the background and running the game in full screen.    Bonus:  If you run windowed, and switch out, the game locks up and stays stuck in foreground.   Alt+F4 is your friend, thankfully.  Kudos to the developers for allowing us to exit the game.   Don't buy this.  Play one of the F2P games from the Steam store instead.			"
