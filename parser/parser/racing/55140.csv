												Fun mx game all around. A nice selection of tracks and great riding physics - the reflex controls make for a very fluid ride. Most other MX games feel very stiff and lacking in comparison when it comes to the flow of reflex. But man what a frustrating, buggy and basic online experience. Lots of glitches (some very entertaining) but most just add to the frustration. Player collision cannot be disabled, so it's not uncommon to be taken out / take out laggy warping players, or players that are just desyncd (their position on your screen doesn't really represent where they really are)...probaby the most frustrating thing of all. Makes it hard to race close a lot of the time. Great MX racing when its actually working though as you react to terrain deformation and scrub your way past riders.- Enough to make you keep coming back for more punishment for years. - But at the same time, enough to make you want to snap your keyboard or smash your controller  when you're playing online and dealing with this crap (and more). Can be a real gamebreaker.			"

												This game is simply ONE OF or if not THE BEST MX game out right now. The physics (while not perfect) offer a great experience today even though this game is five years old. You can whip & control the bike in almost any way you want. There is a big variety of tracks & vehicles as well as customization features. When you get bored of the stock tracks there is a large assortment of custom tracks that are available online. You can also get custom skins for this game (for your rider & bike). If you want to make tracks or skins there is a track & dlc creator. The online works, and what has really got me into this game is competitive online racing. I have a Steam group with currently 148 people in it. We organize races every week or so with a points system and race format. If you are looking for a good MX game with decent looking graphics, good physics and many customization options this is it! Its tons of fun. Even though the game's optimization isn't spick and spam its easy to ignore it. Plug your controller in and have fun. Braaaap!			"

												Yes..... I have 75+ hours on this game. From motos at the track to coming home and rippin some motos on Reflex is as good as it gets. Don't buy into those new releases from MX vs. ATV BS. THIS is the game to own if you're as involved into the sport as I am. The physics reflect that of real life, the ""help me make this jump by preloading the hell out of this ♥♥♥♥♥"" is non exsistent! I may have to stretch for some jumps on an actual track but never have I had the magic joystick launch me 20 ft. further than physics/ gravity allows. Although the game is a few years old and lacking in updated gear, bikes, and racers it stilll brings hours of enjoyment. Whether its off season, too nasty out to ride, or you cased that triple all of your buddies told you to huck and are now sitting at home with a broken femur reading this; this is the game to play to scratch the itch. There is also some good DLC from twisteddirt.com that gives you all the tracks in free ride mode as well as the Geico kits and some custom tracks sprinkled in. All in all get this game. You WILL NOT be disappointed.			"

												The MX vs. ATV series seems to not only represent the battle between motocross bikes and all terrain vehicles, but also the differences between arcade and simulation racing. The newest entry, Reflex, attempts to combine the best of both worlds: outlandish tricks and environments with finely tuned control. The result is a thrilling, yet flawed racing game. It features intuitive controls and a ton of content, but it's only worth checking out if you're a racing fan with patience, yes of course you need patience because sometimes it can be a frustrating game.

												MX vs ATV Reflex is branded as if it's some terrible, B-movie, half arsed attempt at off road racing. Y'know, the kind of game which has cardboard cutout dudes and one metal song as the soundtrack. But...this game has like 15 metal songs and 3D crowds. Also, it's actually brilliant.Unlike DIRT or Toca or maybe WRC 3, there's terrain deforming here which makes races great fun. The AI is as competent as you which makes for really fun races with loads of outrageous crashes, and I've jumped a motorbike over a sport truck multiple times already which is a sign that you should get this. There's a range of vehicles and MX gear and you have to keep your balance on motorbikes which means that you're always involved. The game seems to freeze up sometime but that's just COZ ITS SO FRIGGIN

												In personal opinion, MX vs. ATV is the best motocross/offroad series, after ATV Offroad Fury. Since that title is not available on PC, I made due with purchasing this game as a substitute, and gladly upheld it. The game is no more than more than a couple of career races, as well as features a solo/multiplayer free roam mode as well, perfect for if you and a couple of friends would like to show off tricks to each other, or battle it out head to head in a national series race. The game has several vehicles to choose from, not only MX/ATV, but also dune buggies and sports trucks. Customization is a little lacking but is quite noticable as you progress through the career and upgrade your parts. Same can be said with visual customization, as there are only a few paint styles to choose from, mostly game brand (maybe they're real? I never took the time to check into it) paints for your vehicle, coming in only 4 or 5 different colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, black). Head to head can be sometimes challenging, even on easy mode the last levels seemed to be proven more skillful. I easily could beat pro mode games though, it was not too much of a challenge, since this game is aimed at a wider age group audience, the game does have challenging and non challenging areas. All in all, the game is perfectly great for anyone who is a racing/offroad fan and would like a good game to relax and play.			"

												First Impressions:If you remember the old Motocross Madness 1 & 2 from Microsoft back from 1998-2000 and loved it, then you are going to like this game. It is best to play it with a controller as the mouse to controll your lean and tricks is not ideal. It works well with an Xbox One controller.The only slighly annoying thing from my first hour of gameplay is the narrators voice, but that is an entirely subjective thing.If you want to relive your days of playing Motocross Madness this is as close as you can get on the PC, since Microsoft has abandoned their Madness series and only released the newer Motocross game on the Xbox.

												I'm conflicted to whether I really like it, or simply like it. Trust me, there's a big difference. Either way, the game is definitely worth a look for hardcore racing fans to casual gamers looking to try something new.MX vs. ATV Reflex is an off road racing and stunt game made for enthusiasts. It's also perfectly welcoming to casual gamers with it's well rounded sensitivity (and accuracy) towards in-game accidents. I like the game, but little elements make me dislike it for not being better. The game itself is overall well put together and complimented by a welcoming and to the point visual tutorial. Overall, the gameplay is pretty respectable.The absolute first thing that bugged me was the first person view. I couldn't see the bike or handlebars until I was in motion or if the bike was bumping upwards. Going from MotoGP 13 first person to this is just absolutely horrible. It feels decently adequate but the feel of having absolute full control isn't here. To be in full control, one needs to play in third person view to completely enjoy the game and character stunt movements. My only other complaint is the steering. MotoGP isn't perfect in it's steering, but it feels quite realistic when doing so. Here, it feels choppy or sort of skippy. It doesn't interfere so much in the game play but for people looking for exact motor bike steering, it isn't exactly here. It feels like the game is caught between being an arcade game and a simulation game, such as it's unable to decide which one to be. I find that most successful racing games actually find a balance between the two, REFLEX may have just found it. They sort of force you to stay on course (and will make you respawn if you don't) but there's always a few options here and there to take your own sort of short cut off the track.Additionally, the game is quite gripping and provides for some serious fun. The different game modes include free-roam, race, and stunt. What makes this game quite unique though is that the right analog stick looks after the body movements while the left deals with the bike. This is a fantastic addition to the game as turns can be done on a dime if done right. This also helps rotate the bike in the air while doing stunts. Jumps are pretty rewarding and landings are decently accurate and feel right when their put together back to back. There is a system that exists within the game where if your character loses his balance, you have to use the right thumb stick and push it in a direction multiple times to avoid falling off the bike. Another system to be appreciated as it keeps you on your toes.The driving scheme in general is very beautiful once you get ahold of it. Graphics are absolutely fantastic as tire, bike and body marks on the ground are amazingly drawn. The terrain deformation is astounding. What bugs me the most is the first person view. I wouldn't mind seeing more of the handle bars. Then again, I may have been spoiled by playing MOTOGP first. In addition to the bikes (and unfortunately), players cannot see inside of the buggie or the pick-up truck when in first person as well. I would recommend running the settings first before launching the actual game. Going from 30 to 60fps left me speachless. In addition to good looks, the replays offer a highlight reel which is pretty solid. Watch some solid jumps be pulled off or accidents. The tracks are also well designed and differ from one another (from stadiums to snow-y mountains). Riders sometimes will move their head and check their peripherals while riding. Sounds are pretty decent. The engines vary between bikes and the crowd will make a ""ohhh"" sound if you wipe out. For future MX vs ATV games, the jerky feeling of the steering needs to be addressed. It doesn't feel real at all sometimes especially when making landings. Other times, landings to crashes are absolutely nailed.Overall a pretty good game worth buying especially if on sale. Sucks it doesn't have local co-op but it does have multiplayer if it matters.RATING : 7.45/10 Gameplay A- Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  B+ScreenShots : Me, getting bumped by a truck, which is also a part of this raceThe crash system is fun to abuse......especially when the computers start going at itTerrain deformation occurs even when the riders hit the groundMore unnecessary carnageThe body impact physics are on point Minimalistic first person view.

												Wow! I really like the control system for this game and there are SO many stunts you can do. I wish there were more vehicles and free roam tracks though, but mods will give you more tracks. I had no problem with an xbox 360 controller emulator with my ps3 controller.

												I'll admit, it was frustrating for me at first. The tutorials are all based on m+kb controls, so for each one I had to spend a bit of time fiddling around with my control figuring out how to do stuff. Update: the tutorial now includes support for a controller, which is lovely. Even then, getting the hang of controlling the rider and the bike simultaneously was a bit awkward. But once I got the hang of it...? Pure awesome. I can really feel the rhythm of the race, and it's joyous. The more I played, the more I realized how I can control every bit of motion, and it's fluid and responsive. I'm glad I finally bought it, even if it is lacking split-screen.Update: After some more playtime, I've found a few things that irritate me. One is that the AI is sociopathic; while not as evident on the waypoint races, it's more apparent in the stadium tracks. The AI is determined to ride wherever it wants, and if so happens that the result is a massive wipeout with you, the AI is fine with that. The other quibble I have is that if you crash into a wall or fly off track, the game will sometimes respawn you wherever you were halfway through the crash, meaning an instant crash again, and again, and again... but overall, I find these minor issues compared to how fun the game is.

												The entire series is on sale today so I must tell the new people.: THIS IS THE GAME YOU ARE LOOKING FOR!The rest of the series is not up to par for todays standards. Their latest game is a bunch of DLC that you must buy piece by piece. It is completely broken, and nothing like this game.The Older PS2 game that is falsly listed as being released in 2015 is only cool if you had the ancient PS2 version and you want to relive your childshood. It has a 30 FPS cap.Multiplayer for this game has a frame cap, but iirc it can be tweaked, or patched to fix it.Single player really rocks but the frame rate can get sort of choppy even on the largest game rig.The pros out weigh the cons, and are siple:This is the best MX game you can buy. It has not been topped or matched, and it is a really sweet game. Nordic games put their heart and sole into this title.Xbox 360 conroller works flawlessly ""out of the box"".Tip:Be sure to practice on the load screen practice map. Get to know the bike, and the gameplay will be pretty cool.  "

												Had this game for a few years now and let me warn you first...IT'S NEVER WORKED RIGHT.  There's some kind of problem with the game that doesn't seem to make it work with my gfx card and seems to run only in software mode (from the looks of it).  I originally thought this was a driver problem as when I first had this game I was running a GTX570 1280mb card with an i7 750@4GHZ.  It's 2014 now and it still runs the same (looks like 5fps) using i7 3610 and gtx680m.  Rubbish.  Awful programming.

												A truly satisfying off-road experience, MX vs ATV Reflex shines in all but a few areas. Boasting an excellent physics engine not far behind that of the DIRT series, an eclectic seletion of vehicles from the lightest motocross bikes to large trophy trucks, and a comprehensive range of offroad environments, this game just gets it right in so many ways. Apart from some minor oversight in labeling gamepad controls, this title can be played comfortably with either a controller or mouse and keyboard.

+ Lots of very well designed tracks+ Pretty nice graphics on many maps+ Nice mud deformation and water physics+ A Variety of Vehicles (Dirt bikes, ATVs, UTV, Trucks, Buggy)+ A nice rock/metal soundtrack + LOTS of content, you would have to spend many many hours going through the campaign+ The tutorial is useful, short and sweet (highly suggest you do it before playing)+ There are open world modes for those who just like to ride around in an open world+ Some maps don't set track lines, and relies on the terrain to guide you+ There are shortcuts on some of the more open tracks+ Lots of tricks you can do in and outside of supercross+ Fantastic controls on the motorcycles, you use the right joystick to control the character, so if you turn and move the body to the left you will make a sharp turn, if you hold back you'll go across bunny hops faster, and if you hold forward you will get more air, you also need to use it to stay balanced.- The shop / upgrade system is really bad... there is no variation every upgrade seems to be the same, all the parts are very cheap, and most parts are simply a cosmetic difference.- Many vehicles and tracks are actually LOCKED, meaning you can't access them until much later in the game, even in the arcade mode. :(- There's a mixed-race mode (also in campaign) where trucks and buggies can race alongside bikes and ATVs, this makes NO SENSE to me as the trucks/buggys are A LOT faster, and they don't have to worry about falling off, what's EVEN WORSE is that you can't buy a truck or buggy until you ""unlock them"" much later in the game  (???)- Poor progression system, you basically complete a race just to unlock the next race, there's no real reward- It can be VERY difficult to land properly after doing a trick (I may just be bad)~ Sometimes riders will crash into each other, crash into the edges, create a pile up, or straight up run you over. I found this really amusing and loved it, but some people might get turned off by this.			"

Also the way that you can catch a Rut in this game is unbelievable, and brings in a really realistic feel to it.

												Reflex is what happens when you take extreme MX + ATV racing, remove all the risk of death and crippling injury but keep all of the thrill. Its legitimately the most fun you will have in a game of this sort. Now, it may not look visually stunning, but the gameplay is simply unrivaled. The main mechanic that sets Reflex apart from just about everything else is how you can shift the rider's weight around, this allows a huge degree of control so you can pull off longer, farther jumps and more extreme landings. You can also perform tricks at anytime(when you're in stadiums the crowds go wild when you do) which adds an interesting degree of freedom and you feel like a badass. You get to play through a huge variety of races across many different locations, you also get to costumize your rider and tune your rides. Basically there is a lot to do in this game and its all well executed. A solid 9/10 from me, it loses 1 point cuz it doesn't look outrageously awesome due to occasional pop-ins, but gameplay wise its great!			"

Tricks are great, about the same as the other games.

												The increased rider control really makes it feel like you are an MX pro, skidding round the tracks like you know what you're doing. However, the ''improved physics'' can make bikes and, especially, ATVs feel like you're riding a squirrel with a sugar high as opposed to a finely tuned vehicle – a lot of fun but ultimately out of control. 7/10			"

												Two things. 1) things that i like. 2)things that would make it better. 1.) things that I like.I was recommended this game by my friend and i have thanked him many times. this game is well worth the money and i recommend this to anyone who is a car, dirt bike or atv fanatic because its got (almost) everything that your looking for.if you like street cars then your out of luck. This game has Dirt bikes, atvs (the race ones( A.K.A quads))utvs, sport buggys, and 2 and 4 wheel drive short course trucks. it has good quality grafics and the game is such a good game that i remembers ruts that you cn actually hook up in, but beware becuase yes with ruts comes rounding off the top of jumps, but hey it makes it more realistic. 2.)things that would make it better.so I've been thinking of this for a long time and some things that i found that would make it a better game are.1.snowmobiles.2.timbersleds (dirt bikes with the ski and track that are meant for snow)3.rally cars.4.F1 cars 5.nascarsJust to add some more variety. If the makers made two expansions.         1.SnowIt would add the snowmobile and the timbersled. It would also add snowcross and snowcross nationals for both the snowmobiles and the timbersleds. It would add 4 new snowcross tracks and 6 new snocross nationals tracks. It would also add 2 more free roam maps covered with snow. Before you load in the free roam maps you could choose if you want the snow to be more fluffy and powdery, or more ♥♥♥♥♥ and heavy and better for making jumps and making trails. and you could go into the garage and customize your sled. You could choose you graphics, your ski type, your track length. and of course first you would have to choose from three different sizes of a snowmobile. You could choose either a 500, 600, or 800.Thats all for the Snow expansion. Next is the Car expansion.2.) Cars This expansion would add Rally cars (the tiny SUV like cars that race on dirt and asphalt), F1 cars ( the super fast ones that are really loud and short), and Nascar (the ones that just race in a circle track). It would also add 12 new maps. 3 new nascar tracks, 4 F1 tracks, and 5 rally car tracks.Thats about all that I have to say but if Double Helix Games ,Rainbow Studios, THQ Nordic coud make these expansions then I would buy then in an instant and for pricing, I would say that the Snow expansion would be about $10 dollars and the Cars expansion would be about $15-$20 dollars. That is all, thank you.			"

												Warning: Before you buy this game, please check if you have an AMD Radeon or a Nvidia Geforce graphics card. If you have an AMD, don't buy it. The port isn't optimized at all for AMD cards, so you won't get more than 5 fps during any non-solo races.

												Hands down the greatest moto/supercross game of all time. I have played them all, from Excitebike and Motocross Madness to Supercross 2000 and every other pro title, all amazing in their own way but never achieving that truly real motorbike physics feel. Reflex is the closest you'll get to the real thing and having grown up on dirtbikes and video games I was so impressed at the physics of this game its been almost 4 years and I have yet to go longer than a month without playing.Nothing is perfect however and although this game is seriously ♥♥♥♥ing awesome the lack of any real career/season mode brings it down big time. The only thing I find myself doing is the online multiplayer anyway so the lack of a career mode doesn't even matter. Don't even try and play this without a controller.			"

												IMPORTANT READ THIS BEFORE BUYING AND GETTING SCREWED OVER AS I HAVEIf you are running an AMD graphics card this game will not work for you, the developers don't seem to care and have shown no signs of fixing this issue. Specifically: In single player free ride the game will run brilliantly, with top graphics settings etc. BUT try and race with any AI opponents then the FPS goes down to about 10-15 frames per sec.

Not everyone can figure it out though and thats fine.  I've spent countless hours playing the console versions of this game since I downloaded it on a pc that was sub par and did not run it well.

												This game only brings back all the good memories of MX vs ATV on the PS2, except the fact that it has better graphics, more realistic physics, and mutliplayer. Which I never experienced before on PS2, except for split screen. Being the old game that it is though, there are next to no players online and the motocareer does get repetitive at times. Only purchase if it's 75% or more off, otherwise for the same price you could get something much better.			"

 Reflex is still king, 2016. GAMEPLAY:There is plenty of content to take on in Reflex. For example, there's a handful of national and supercross tracks to race on. In addition, there are also a ton of different game modes for you to have fun with such as FMX competitions, racing off-road trucks, UTV's, or buggies etc. Most importantly (for me) is that the base game has a decent amount of customization options from gear, to bike parts, and graphic kits. ALTHOUGH, if you get sick of the same old skins (as well as tracks), then go visit http://reflex-central.com/ for some mods. Moving on, I've found it quite hard to always have a perfect lap considering that the track develops lines (or ruts) the more you ride on it. In other words, every lap feels like a different approach is needed unless you can follow through with your exact line perfectly.CONTROLS:While using a controller to play the game, you use the left analog stick to steer your bike and the right analog stick to control your rider. So if you were to ride a berm to the left, you would basically move both sticks to the left to make your rider lean into the berm. Furthermore, if you were to speed over some whoops, you would move the right stick only backwards so that your rider leans a bit back to absord the rough part of the track.ONLINE: I still find a ton of racers online in 2016. Although, online gameplay is where the cons are for me. For example, racing with other races can be challenging (or annoying) considering how it appears that your opponents are bouncing around all over the track. Furthermore, there is this thing known as the whip glitch that allows you to easily clear jumps. A lot of online racers abuse this, ""whip glitch"" making them ultimately faster than you unless you can do it too. If you want to have a fair race, play this game online with a friend. GRAPHICS & PERFORMANCE:I'm using a 3570k stock, 780 SC, and 16GB of RAM. With that said, performance is great. Although, I can remember it being not so great when I had AMD hardware. Moving on, the game still looks great in 2016 thanks to the power of PC gaming. For example, here is one of my screenshots @ 1440p.

OVERALL:9 out of 10, this game is a must have for any motocross/off-road racing fan. Do note that this game usually goes on sale on Steam for a few bucks and that's a steal! I have purchased this game so many times on Steam as gifts for others.			"

												Best MX Vs. ATV game yet! I've played newer ones and they just don't live up to my expectations like this one has! I remember when this first came out back in 2016! 6 years ago! (from writing this review in 2016)Every now and then there are some hilarious physics bugs but mostly it's a working game with multiplayer and campaign! (no story, just campaign. Similar to NFS games)As for the price. Look, the game isn't brand new anymore and you need to understand that. I got the game in a bundle a while ago and I'm happy that I did. I wanted the game (I played it for a long time on X360 before PC) on my PC and I wanted to pay for it. The developers sure do deserve the money that goes towards them just from this game alone!Now, when you buy it remember...it's mostly focuses on MX and Atv vehicles. They are the only vehicles with 'Rider Reflex'. (The ability to shift your weight on the bike/atv. Which this game's all about)This game has always been a 10/10 for me, ever since the first day, to this day and onwards!It's a game from 2010 with better graphics than most games coming out today!

												Take this lightly, or get mad if you'd like!This is the second of the MX vs. ATV Series I've played.Let's start off by saying this, this game is lacking a lot, but the community keeps the game alive to this very day.The game is so straight forward and feels like a lesser content version than MXGP.I fell in love with the game though, throughout all you get to do, it makes the over all experience extremely worth it. From the abundance of things you get to do throughout the Free Ride mode it almost makes me wanna say it feels like they put more effort into this game than Supercross/Supercross Encore ever got.I feel like the game truly tries to keep you occupied at all times, even during the loading as it just gives you a place to pull off some freestyle stuff and enter the even when you want to.The riding physics I feel are accurate, leaving you with a taste of realism and learning to truly master the handling of a bike.The bike options are very nice as well, especially with the modding community you almost feel inclined to buy all the bikes, and then mod the game to give you more options, or bring your own bike to life.That said, I really liked the experience, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth with the base game content, all good be achieved better and if another title is coming after Supercross Encore, they need to fill up the game, and then slowly bleed more content into afterwards.

												Great game, almost beat it (i logged almost 30 hours offline). I, for sure, would recommend that if you get this game to get a controller too. It feels smoother and better with one, as i have moved over to one from the classic keyboard and mouse. But the classic keyboard and mouse aspect adds a bit more complexity because you dont have the smooth turning like you do with a controller, its just instantaneous turning. But you could easily say to that, to each their own. Great game, love it.			"

												If you're a motocross or not this game is a $20 well spent, there are many maps and race modes. The is no true story however, the game is simply win races, get new bikes and then upgrade them. Although this may sound increably bland it's not what so ever, the tracks are very diverse and the one terrain may grip well and all is good the next minute in you're in deep sand, snow, mud, etc. The game is truely based around the players style of riding and looks, certain bikes have advantages and disadvatages, one bike may be lighter but have less topspeed vise-versa. The bikes are very customizeable, every thing from the graphics to the tires, even hubs and wheels can change colors. Diffrent tires have adv. and disadv., as well as forks,handle bars and more. Even the rider is completely customizable. All  the brands to choose are actual brands adding a sence of realizem for those of us real life riders.The fun doesn't stop at the in game content, with some simple moding you can add user created tracks as well as create you're own with ease.To anyone looking for a good time and a game to play with some friends in online mode (which is currenntly down) I HIGHLY recommend this game.

												The best motocross game made since Motocross Madness and not surprising, either, given it was developed by Rainbow Studios, the same team responsible for developing the Motocross Madness series. Incredibly rewarding as both an arcade and simulation game in the same way SKATE was. It's a pity its 'successor', MX vs. ATV Supercross Encore, couldn't come close to this game.			"

												I have never played a motocross game since Excitebike on the Nintendo :PI did my research and Reflex seemed to be the best in the genre despite his age. I tried it and instantly felt in love. This game is perfect for what I was looking for. I'm using the Xbox 360 controller and nothing to say it's good. I made it better looking with Reshade Framework, and downloaded some tracks on a mods website, could not be  happier. I'm enjoying the races very much !			"

												MX vs ATV Reflex is a spectacular Motocross/ATV game hybrid that simply trumps all it's predecessors. It's graphics are second to none, it's gameplay has no hint of slowing down, and it truly reminds me of some of the legends in the genre. Such as Motocross Madness or ATV Offroad Fury.While it doesn't superceed either of those games Reflex is still a worthy purchase and it runs amazingly well on PC.			"

												Got this from the humble bundle pack iirc.Game was somewhat enjoyable but can be confusing to many, physics is abit funny too especially when doing freestyle events.I simply enjoy wrecking myself and slamming my body into weird positions.Races tend to get longer and longer, and just requires you to hold down accelerate for the entire duration.Gameplay is abit bland and repetitive, despite the choices of vehicles and riders we can choose from.Overall, this game was good while it lastedYes, this is an old game, so it shouldn't be as good as it would be in the current standards.

												A very unique racing game. It isn't the kind of racing game that relies on how fast you go and how good your vehicle is, but instead is reliant on how you time your jumps and turns. It has a lot of veriety and even when you're done theres a ton of mods out there. It's a shame the series became extremely arcady and careless as far as the PC versions go.As someone who owns an ATV and a dirt bike, I felt like this game handeled how it made those two work. Mostly the dirt bikes though, not so much the ATV's, as the ATV's are basically just the MX but with slight differences when it comes to this game.Lots of pointless stuff too. If you want to complete moto-career 100% you need to race in Sports Trucks, Buggys, and UTV's which are no where near as much fun as the ATV's and MX (at least when it comes to video games), but it's totally optional stuff.Also, this game has some very impressive physics that hold up to this day, all though the graphics themself don't really look all too good as they did years ago.

												It looks like it could be good, I don't really know how good because were MX vs ATV's unleashed you can use a joystick, here you can't. Even though it is not mentioned in the store page, there is no use of joystick here. Only the keyboard, or a PS4 or X-box game pad. And I am only asumming the pad because I do not own the $80.00 controller. I just own a $19.00 Logitech Attack 3 joyy stick that has worked prefactly in every way in MX vs ATV's unleashed. In MX vs ATV's unleashed you can assign pratcially anything to anything including use of mixed buttons on the joystick. How ever You can not in MX vs ATV Reflex. The selections are a little confuseing and tricky. It's like the dev was confussed in his own work and tried to make it simple for him to understand what to do.The graphics look better than MX vs ATV's unleashed and...... and........ and.... well THQ are Hoda fans because it starts you out with a red bike... and.... and..... hummmm.... Well do to the controller issue unlike MX vs ATV unleashed I can't tell you more, so If you get this game, make sure you have a PS4 or X-BOX controller frist, because if your useing your cheap, economy, affordable in this day and age, happy joystick , it will not work in this game at all. If is not getting recomended because of this. Glad I paid $3.00 for the game, I hate be the foolish sucker and get it at full price and be stuck with it doing nothing. All this over a controller... tsk, tsk, sad...-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 01/06/2016The game is very cool, the graphics and effects are very impressive. Now I have a proper controller I can now tell more.. The map lay outs are very good, but I discovered in the game the key board and mouse deal is not going to work out at all, you really do need the controller, way more efficent improvment. How ever were MX vs ATV's unleashed is closer to real handling, this game not so much. You really have to work with it. For example on jumps and wip de-do's your bike tends to fall forward and hard at times to get it back straight for some reason, not to mention the fight to keep it straight at times going over these objects.The only free ride so far I found was a off trail map, which is fine to learn your bike for better handling, but not so much help for you to get pratice on the tracks were you need it the most. Mainly since your bike rides like the track is held in zero-G. So it requiers time, I already had played on the MP level with another player, it was fun, but since there is no way to pratice on a race track like you can in MX vs ATV's unleashed, I kept finding myself accdently hitting the other rider as if my bike was magniticly drawn to him. causeing him to chrash for not. So the riding handling is way more steeper than a real dirt bike. But in time I am sure this would straighten out maybe. The other thing is cheat codes can be applied, I do not know if they are used only for the single player mod, or can be used for both single player and MP. Over all it was a good game. So in the end, with mixed emotions, I will give a thumbs up for the effert by Nordic games, But due to some issues of ridiculos handling that I never had a problem on the real thing, not to mention you are supose to be able to bind the controller functions, but it dosen't let you do re-binds, and a need for cheat codes, I am still not going to recommend the game, but I am also not going to say don't buy it either. So really, it will be up to you, is this your kind of game? or not. But I will recomend the game pad controller. GPX ThrustMaster, it is licensed officaly through Microsoft, for the X-box 360 and PC compatable. Cost me $29.99. You can probably order it through ""Game Stop"", I got it at Amazon..			"

												I loved the old MX vs ATV Unleashed on the PS2. I saw this come up 75% off and decided to buy it. I'm up to almost 100 Hours in the past month, and am still having quite a bit of frun with it. It can be slow on your own but with friends it is amazing. I highly reccommend having a controller hooked up to your computer if you wish to be any good at this game.			"

												Nice find! Picked this up on sale through the humble store and wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly suprised.  I'm still playing it, and all of my experience has been with single player, no online.  The physics and ragdoll effects are fun and realistic ( I guess?)  and the tarcks don't get to repeditive, except there are a few really long 15 minute races.  I'm playing on normal difficulty and the computer is a joke, so you might want to bump it up.  You can customize the looks of your vehicles, but the upgrades are all the same ""power-wise"" which is a little disapointing, meaning all of the vehicles are pretty much the same, they just handle a bit differently.  It's a nice little racer that you can play for 15-30 minutes at a time, and doesn't take itself to seriously.  I recomend it for less than $10.  $5 is a steal.			"

												If you're going to get a dirt bike game for pc this is the one. It may be older than 'MX vs ATV Supercross Encore' but it's much more polished and you get a complete game with one download. Not to mention this has all the types of tracks that the newer games have but with a stable framerate. The gameplay is fun, fluid, and exciting. All at a lesser price than 'Encore'. Simply put, it's a total package for a better price.I played through the entire dirtbike career and won a few nationals races on the hardest difficulty. "

												CANCEL YOUR PRE-ORDER of SUPERCROSS.  GET YOUR MONEY BACK!This game has serious issues on AMD video cards.  DO NOT BUY.  The developers refuse to address this problem.  If you have an AMD card you will experience AWFUL slowdown, screen tearing and artifacts.  The artifacts truly look as though they are DESTROYING your PC.  Absolutely NO excuse for how bad this game runs.  Nordic should be ashamed for this BROKEN game to remain on Steam for this price. I have two systems both with R9 290X cards, and on some maps with heavy ""mud"" the slowdown can crawl into the 5fps range.  My PC has no problems with physX because I have a GTX 670 4gb as a dedicated physics card.  That means games that were specifically designed to make use of proprietary physics code run flawlessly.  It is NOT a hardware issue, it is the absolute fault of the devs here.  It is NOT a driver issue, believe me, I have done way more than ""normal"" troubleshooting in a complete waste of time and you know what?  I bought this game for my son who at first was able to play through the horrible bugs but even he, being young, can't look past that anymore, and choses to just play on the ""lobby"" map for hours and has to quit the game and reload when it attempts to start a real map.Broken pile of garbage.  DO NOT BUY if you have ANY AMD hardware in your system.  Don't be another lost voice asking for help which will never be addressed.  CERTAINLY  do not buy another Nordic games title if you already fell for this one and got short-changed.Horrible experience, scale from 1-1 million, 0/1,000,000.EDIT 9/16/2014:In the event the mods delete my forum post regarding this issue that I recently took up again in an attempt to fix, here is a paste of said post:Canceled my Supercross pre-order and never buying Nordic games again. Horrible company.I can only sit here and watch my son play MX vs ATV Reflex with it's terrible lag and video artifacts for so long until I am speechless as to how a company that is supposed to be professional can refuse to fix blatant, game-breaking problems. Support is apathetic. They do not care. My son plays this game. As a child, who is obsessed with dirt bikes, he has learned how to play this game and embrace the absurdity. The bugs and glitches have become ""just part of the game"" for him. He is a child, willing to do anything to find enjoyment where all I see is amateur mistakes.He blamed me at first, and I had to go through the motions of trying out 3 other graphics cards that didn't work just to satisfy his curiosity as for the longest time he thought it was my r9 290x and GTX 770 cards that weren't ""working"" right. Truth be told, he has actually learned a lot from this ordeal, and I have used the opportunity to teach him more about how computers work. He got to see dad taking apart three different systems, install three different versions of windows, so this was not at all a waste of time; Should Nordic feel proud of this? Making a game that has a myriad of problems that it makes other ""problem"" games seem better by comparison? Letting what I assume was to be a flagship title fester and stagnate so that only a small percentage of buyers could actually play the game without having to incorporate AWFUL graphics issues like 5 frames per second and full screen artifacts? There is no excuse for this. Thankfully I've persuaded him to branch out to other racing games, and he is becoming more interested in all things motorcycle, and the Saints Row games have been providing him enough diversion to not care about the next game in this series, and I've alleviated the stress for both of us by promising him GTA V when it's released. As a gamer, I usually never go on a tirade about bad business practices in this industry because let's face it, since the 80's we've had to, by trial and error, learn how to not let little stuff get to us. If this were a game I erroneously bought for myself at any other time I would have chalked it up to a bad buying decision and a need for me to find demos or do more research before opening up my wallet. Sadly, as a parent, I did not afford myself or my family the luxury of knowledge this time around, and I've been rewarded with a 8 year old child who through no fault of his own has had to learn and endure way more than I ever thought a stupid videogame would introduce.It's sad. Bless his heart he eventually saw that I was getting tired of having to prove to him that it wasn't dad's fault that the game was a buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥. Now he thinks he has to play the game and try to show dad that he can have fun and justify the purchase. No matter how many times I tell him it's OK, it isn't his fault, he still wants to make me happy. So I wake up on weekends hearing this game's bikes go RRRRR RRRREER and he puts on a display how much fun he's having. He plays so that I can see for a while, and I have to tell him it's OK if he does something else. Thanks Nordic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. ♥♥♥♥ you for disappointing my kids. After all this time, your only excuse is that you dont give a ♥♥♥♥.			"

Hands down the best movement and physics controls in any dirt bike game.  this game has the best whip action out of any dirt bike game,  and you get multiple type of vehicles (even though I stick with 2 wheels most the time).If The console version is this good, this means the PC version is way better.  The console versions multiplayer (online) does not exist, they shut it down.  But on PC you get multiplayer and custom maps, mods ETC... The only negative I have is the Free Ride Maps.

												I absolutely love this game.  The terraforming is so important because the groove you make in one llap could be what knocks you loose the next.  It's got a good blend of vehicles which for the most part are well-balanced.  There is no contest with the mixed races as the dirtbikes literally get run over by the trucks.I had a blast playing, and my son watching.  It's a great example of how any game with dirt should behave.			"

												How about this for a review. I love this game on the Xbox 360. So I spend my $15 on the disc for the PC. First off I have to endure starting up Steam everytime I play this thing, which has to be one of the most annoying sales pitch focused providers in all of the online gaming community. Then I try to play with my Xbox controller which works for every other game I play on my PC that uses a game pad. Ohhh woops..... seems that doesn't work for this game. So now I've payed these lames $15 for something that doesn't work. I've tried everything on the forums so far and nothing works, and why should I need to do that anyway? Shouldn't I just be able to plug in the controller of my choice and enjoying what I paid for? Too bad Nordic games or someone at Steam never bothered to see if this game actually was playable with a reasonable variety of input devices. This certainly bodes well for the new MX vs. ATV that Nordic will be putting out ...... NOT!I highly recommend this game, it's fantastic. But I would never recommend this version as purveyed by Steam. Figure out if your game works before you ask anyone to pay you money for it!			"

												I can't really recommend this game. The ""Reflex"" system of controlling your rider and bike seperately is a bit awkward, and it quickly gets annoying that you fall off the motorcycle every time you touch anything. The thing that really keeps me from recommending the game is that it just looks terrible. I'm not very picky about graphics and decent gameplay can justify outdated graphics, but this is just embarassing. The terrain textures are bland and flat, and the environments are all extremely uninteresting.I have to say I recommend playing Motocross Madness 2 instead, despite it being years older.			"

												Now before you say this review isnt helpful just because your a fan boy of the game really think about my reasoning and why I might not recommend this game.Gameplay: Overall the gameplay is good. The bikes feel smooth the movement feels natural and on a good track feels really flowy. The only thing I dont like about this games riding is the way the bikes feel. The bikes feel almost like they dont have any weight. A good comparison is probably Skyrim's melee fighting.Sound: Bike sounds are okay at best. They kinda sound generic but its fine for me.Content: The content the game comes with is kinda good maybe a little above average. The tracks are mainly motocross and supercross with some freeroam maps thrown in. The only reason I played this game so much is because of the modding. There are plenty of bike skins and tracks to chose from and the higher quality ones are super fun (way better than the tracks the game comes with).Graphics: I would say the graphics are ok. Obviously this game is kinda old so you cant expect much.Why do I not recommend this game? If your like me and you wanted to build a pc based around amd stuff this game SUCKS! In multiplayer with a full lobby you can expect very bad performance. Also there are no known fixes.Now before you say my pc sucks I have seen many other people with this same problem on VERY VERY high end pcs.With AMD: 4/10 Only worth the money on sale and if you only want to play modded maps in singleplayerWith Nvdia/Intel: 8/10If your looking for alternatives I highly suggest MXGP <3			"

												Bad game, not enough maps, really hard to get the interface to work efficiently. The maps are really tiny for the free roam or ""mini games"" (there are literally two, snake and a get a flaming pig head). The game doesn't work well for some people online. Even though both people have the same atv, truck, buggy, whatever and they both hold W they will go at different speeds. I'm fine becuase I win the games against my friends by a solid minute every time, my friends hate that they apparently can't go quickly in the game.			"

												My GF got me this game, and we played it together expecting a PC quality game, what we got has the feel of a last minute port from xbox 360.The graphics are pretty good, but have few actual settings, and your tire tracks shine and sparkle, whether it's in mud, dirt, or snow. Snow and mud make sense, but dirt does not sparkle nor shine, so that is poorly done.The dynamic terrain is mostly astetic, you need to race several laps to where the dirt piles into mounds before it will actually effect your driving, whether it's in a vehicle or the (what should be) much more sensitive to terrain motocross bike.The only controller supported is the Xbox 360 one, which is sad since legacy controller support like most PC games use will let you map ANY controller, if you use ANY other controller, have xpadder on hand, and be ready for worse sensitivity than you should ever have with an analog stick.Another thing on sensitivity, there isn't any settings for it on keyboard, or even if you use the supported controller, so expect to do hard turns on smooth corners a lot.Tilting should have you Lean and break/gas/steer, the game is supposed to be specifically for the combination of leaning, and throttle/break/steering, but leaning wont effect forward and back tilting in the air, not even on MX, it's only the gas and break, it's unrealistic when you can lean backwards but you tilt forwards because you're breaking, and invalidates the game's primary selling point.Air time is a little bit much and vaguley borderline realistic, it doesn't really bother gameplay since most people enjoy the extra air time, nor does it stand out as arcade-esk airtime.All in all, if you still use the dated 360 controller for gaming on PC (Or you like keyboards for racing games), you dont mind the graphics of a last minute console port, and you dont really care about the whole ""reflex"" part of the game (since it's vaguley there), you may like this game.Personally, we did not, she would have asked for a refund but it was on sale and this game was about worth the $10 she paid for 2 copies.

												Now I know what your thinking. MX vs ATV? How can it be bad? Well it probably is...on a console. MX vs ATV Reflex is one sad excuse of a PC port. The game runs terribly. I can barely get 20 FPS even running on very low settings. Also the graphics aren't really that good. There kind of sloppy, and you can see where the developers added little pretties to hide the ugly monster within. Another thing to mention is the cameras. This game holds the most dimwitted camera system there is. And adding the lagginess to the game makes the camera even worse. It nearly gives you motion sickness. There is another thing that is bad to. The sounds. Oh my goodness the sounds! They go from making your ear drums bleed to quiet whispers with no transition. Also the developers have clearly never heard of the fact that trucks and most offroad vehicles have a thing called a transmission. The sound is just a loop. You never change up or down, so all you hear is a constant poorly recorded single engine note the entire time. It is just annoying. And as I said about the cameras, when you add the laginess it is much worse.Now I try to find good in everything. And I am happy to say this game does have a few things going this way, such as the amazing terrain deformation and the somewhat cool tricks system.But sadly those cool features are overtaken by the badness and the little silly things that are just annoying. You saw the things above, but guess what? Theres more. The developers thought it was vital to our gameplay experience to add scadily dressed line girls and a narrarator that sounds like batman. There is also use of words such as ""rad"" and ""knarly"" which is ok, but a little overdone if you know what I mean. Now ok, I understand the clients that they are trying to get to, such as real offroad enthusiasts like this kind of thing. But newsflash!  Real offroad enthusiasts have real offroad toys, so why would they play this silly game when they could go out (in real life) and thrash around on there motorcycle? See what I'm getting to? For us normal joes who just want to play a motorcycle game. We don't need line girls, or words of yobs. We just want to thrash around on a virtual motorcycle. This fact and the horrid laginess gets this game what it deserves.Rating 3.5/10 Also posted on the Do's and Don'ts steam group. For more game reviews, give us a visit.			"

												This is the best Motorcross / Supercross game available for PC. This builds on the previous games in the series, and adds a system where you can control your body lean independent of the bike. It also adds terrain deformation, which works really well to simulate a track that degrades over time.The developer, Rainbow, has been making MX games since the 90s. They were very good at it, but the developer is no more due to the THQ debacle.There will likely not be another game like this on PC for some time. Worth the price of admission for MX/SX fans!			"

												This seems like it might be a good game (I'd probably give it a neutral/mixed review if Steam had that option), but I have a modified control setup due to pain in my hand and the controls were really difficult. Some people with a normal control setup also complained about the controls, but I'm not sure I'd have an issue with the normal setup. There's a link to the manual on Steam's store page if you're curious about the controls.I tried rebinding the controls, but the options for rebinding the controller are incredibly obtuse. My guess is that rebinding for keyboard would be fine so if you use M/KB (or just keyboard) you won't have the same issues as me. If I had more time (or wasn't able to get a refund), I could have tried using external programs, but I didn't want to risk playing over 2 hours (I spent over an hour in the tutorial and options menu) which would disqualify me for a refund.

												The worst Atv/Mx game I have ever played. Might as well go back to Mx vs Atv Unleased released for the PC many years ago. The handling and physics here are a joke. Every vehicle feels like its made of helium and proceeds to bounce around the track on the edge of control. The stunt system was just made obtuse to be obtuse, Up-Left-Down=Trick. I thought Trucks and UTVs might be fun because I could then ignore the ""reflex system"". I was very wrong, they are actually worse because when they bounce off the track you end up hitting trees and rocks, I was stuck between two tree limbs unable to back up and reset didnt work because I was still on track, ARGH. Just a shoddy poorly programmed dirtbike game saddled with a ""Reflex system"" that only serves to complicate and frustrate the rider and the quicktime hard landing event is just the final straw. I have been wrecked many times because of a small bump that flashed a random direction and I didnt push it fast enough. I tried to like this but it really fights with me, for every good there is a bad and the Reflex system just leads me to ask ""Why?"". I want to push up on the same thumbstick I am using to steer, its natural but with Reflex they moved it to the other Thumbstick. Unfortunately the game would have been better without it, its heartbreaking but it really cripples the fun and makes sharp/fast corners an iffy proposition.In short I want my five dollars back. MotorCross madness is rolling over in its grave, shame Rainbow, shame. To think of the games these guys made and to have it come to this. I can only guess some pencil pusher shoved this stupid system on them and forced it by leveraging funding for the game, why else would they do it. Its hard to bury a friend but MX vs ATV you are dead to me, goodbye old friend.			"

												Kind of disappointing.While this game can be fun for a little while, you will unforntatuely begin to see more an more proplems as you play. The first glaring issue is the controls. If I had to describe them in one way I would describe them as huge handful of ♥♥♥. The vechiles (mx exsbesily) can be extremly twitchy and ficle, and while this may be fun for a quick luagh or two when you first start the game it quickly become hordenus. No place is this more evident then in the races where you have to stay on the track or risk being penilised, a task made very hard by controls that seem to want to throw you off the track just for the fun of it. Next up is the sountrack. Its pretty god-awful. The entire sountrack is full on hard-rock, which normaly isn't a proplem however the songs they selected for the sountrack sound as if they took a co-wookers ipod, hit suffule, and just used all the songs that came up over a period of an hour. There feels as if there is no flow between the songs and despite being displayed over something as bad ♥♥♥ as offroading seem not to fit the action on the screen at all. There is also the graphics proplem, simply put this game look not a whole lot better than ps2 games such as Off-Road Fury 4 (a much-much better game). Some people will not be bothered by this, and some will, I unforntaely happen to fall in the later category. When first loading the game it will look decent but out of another era of gaming entirely (think middle/early-late ps2 era). There are also texture proplems and what seems to be just bad judgement when it came to graphics design.I would like to end my review by stating that the devolper listed for this game was not responsible for it. THQ orginaly created this game (as seen by there logo everywhere in the game) and they should be blammed for this rather bad game. I hope the current owner of the license to the series (they bought it when thq went under) will be able to find a niche for the series and bring to it some new ideas and decent gameplay. Unitl then I'll be paciently waiting.			"

												I bought this game, hoping to play split-screen with my mudder buddies. Only to find out that the trailer lied to us and there isn't even dag gung split-screen. This dung dun ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me and my mudder buddies off. We would've complained, but we ain't like that. We just went on with our mudder lives and prepared our ATVs for the next race. Seriously though, we could've bought a choocher instead of this game if we had known there wasn't no dung dang split-screen on this doom damn game.			"

												This is a great racing game if you like dirt racing on motorcycles/atv/buggies. There are a huge variety of tracks, and a huge number of races.The lean controls on the right analog stick really make this game feel different than many other racing games. When you hit a corner just right on a dirtbike while leaning at the perfect angle, you can feel the speed and grip difference. One negative I do have against the game is that it didn't really make it clear how to buy/change vehicles. I ended up using the first bike for the first 2 hours or so of the game. I didn't really think to buy a new bike until I started having a harder time finishing on the podium. After I got the best bike I had unlocked the game became too easy and I ended up bumping the difficulty to the 3rd of 4 difficulty settings.			"

												Very rough around the edges with hilariously bad presentation. A low-budget game, with a reasonable price, it's seriously freakin' good though. The physics and tight controls make it quite a thrilling experience, going high speed around a track flying through the air with only your own skill left to control it. I very much enjoy this game and will be keeping it installed on my PC to hop on for 5-10 minute intervals. Highly recommended (from the Humble E3 Bundle) -- default price isn't horrible but I'd definitely wait for a sale because like I said, the game has not got the usual shine or polish you'd see from a licensed game.

												In MX vs ATV Reflex, you get to race a whole load of vehicles, but it's really all about the motorbikes! To start with, I definitely recommend a controller for this game!When you first play this (The motorbike that is), you might be put off by the control system...because it's not like your usual car game where you use one stick for steering. In MX vs ATV you use both. One stick is your steering and the other is your body placement, allowing for full control of your angle when taking a tight corner.Don't let this put you off...stick to it and be patient with learning it, because once you have, it reveals what a satisfying racing and game play experience this title offers. You aren't limited to wining an A to B race, you can throw in awesome tricks (easily pulled off by pressing your left button and moving the right stick mid air), to gain more money allowing you to tweak your rides (better tires, exhausts that affect performance), and looks (both vehicles and rider). Once you've won a race or two in career mode, and tweak your bike with better stuff, your ability to pull off crazy tricks in a race is raised! You don't only get to race against others...there are exploration modes where you motocross your way to different markers on huge maps, and take some challenges. These vary from Hill Climb events, to jump accuracy events and so on..Personally I am glad I purchased this title (got it cheap) but honestly it's enough fun to recommend at full price too. Personal Rating: A fun engrossing racer, with good graphics and satisfying gameplay. Good Graphics, Lots of Mud, and hilarious when you get a stunt wrong and end up face planting into a tree!Percentage Rating: 85% Not for people wanting a quick arcade fix, this is nearly the perfect balance between arcade and simulation!

												A friend and I paid full price for this game, which we both agree was steep in regards to the game itself. However, we were able to join eachother for races/freeride no problemo. If our money goes towards continued multiplayer connectivity, we shall consider it worthy of the $22(CDN) price tag.+ The amount of control you have over your bike is on a whole 'nother level. + Throughout a race, the track gets more and more beat up by the bike tires. (Terrain deformation)+ Great customization+ Low system requirements+ Good graphics (on high) with emphasis on vehicle detail.			"

												Great game. I was first introduced to it when i played it with my friend on his XBOX 360 at his house, and i liked the game. Later, i bought it for PC. Its a great game, lots of fun, and the Rider Reflex system is quite unique and innovative. If you like riding motocross or ATVs, or want to drive trophy trucks or dune buggies, then i recommend this game. Theres also plenty of customization and tracks.The multiplayer may be a bit empty sometimes, but when you do get 10 players or so it can be quite fun.			"

												I should play more off road racing titles because I love mastering the track deformation. The controls earn the most praise here as the left stick is for the bike and the right is for the rider which I hear is a new system which works flawlessly for balancing and performing tricks. Nice variety of vehicles to chose from which was unexpected but I guess MX vs ATV vs UTV vs Sports Buggy vs Sports Truck wasn't as catchy. Nice vehicle/driver customisation too. Highly recommending for anyone in the mood for a racing game.			"

If you have fun with this game go ahead and get MXGP as well because you'll have a blast with it too, but this game feels a lot more ""accessable"" for lack of better terms!Have fun,-Brandon			"

												This is a great racing game if you like dirt racing on motorcycles/atv/buggies. There are a huge variety of tracks, and a huge number of races.The lean controls on the right analog stick really make this game feel different than many other racing games. When you hit a corner just right on a dirtbike while leaning at the perfect angle, you can feel the speed and grip difference. One negative I do have against the game is that it didn't really make it clear how to buy/change vehicles. I ended up using the first bike for the first 2 hours or so of the game. I didn't really think to buy a new bike until I started having a harder time finishing on the podium. After I got the best bike I had unlocked the game became too easy and I ended up bumping the difficulty to the 3rd of 4 difficulty settings.			"

												Quite possibly the worst ATV racer I've ever played.It's incredibly boring for one.The sounds of the bikes are way off. When you go off a jump, it's as if you floored it instantly. No revving up, just straight up redline RPM. And then hitting the bumps, hearing a couple hundred RPM to a couple thousand in the matter of seconds just sounds like ♥♥♥♥.The physics suck. I can understand if you're trying to go for an arcade racer or a sim racer, but don't try to do both at the same time.  The leaning controls also suck. Why would I use one stick to turn and the other stick to lean?Tricks. This isn't Mortal Kombat. Why have such a stupid trick system?Next to nobody plays this game online anymore.Another reviewer said that they're glad they removed the risk of injury and death. I spent 15 minutes laughing at how funny the crashes are. That's the one positive of this game. The crashes. I only wish I could break my racers neck when I attempt to do a backflip (which you can't as far as I can tell.)1/10I have literally played better off road racers on the PS2.			"

Pros:• Mx are fun to ride• You can dig into terrain with your wheels and it will affect the track more and more over laps.Cons:• Sounds, especially engine sounds are awful. How silly can it be when a motor game take the sound part aside?• Music: oh dear! What is this west coast metal crap??? Devs, this is just annoying, even acidjazz would be more pleasant.• Game menus: (Devs: Please take note, a label is not a button or a good way to dispose some primary interaction.) You shall learn by yourself how to get to the action you are looking for.• the game is not 100% gamepad compliant, cannot go through all menus with your pad, you have to jump on your keyboard sometimes.• IA does not worth a penny• there is no point playing with trucks, they are boring and meaningless• Available playing views: cameras won't help you much for ""Discovery"" challenges• Discovery challenges: there are little-tiny-♥♥♥♥♥♥-flags you will be looking for, do not mind it, challenging at first, it will become boredomWell, I got the game for 0.79€, hopefuly I did not put much into it. What a relief!Even for 5€ you would lose your bucks.			"

												Best 1,99 i have ever spent on steam. This game is a true gem that any MX-head should own. It took me on some nostalgic trips back to playing Motocross Madness as a young child. Riding feels generic, tracks are challenging (but not over the top), 2stroke sounds heavenly, and you can whip it like Bubba.Tons of fun to be had in this well rounded game!			"

But this beautiful game has such a great system of control that I found that the mouse/kb arrangement works so well its perfect to use here.

												MX vs ATV: Reflex is an impressive offroad racing game which, contrary to its title, allows you to drive not only two classes of MX bikes and ATVs but also several types of offroad cars, from buggies to 4x4 trucks.Developed by the team behind the classic Motocross Madness series, MX vs ATV offers a variety of racing modes across closed stadium and outdoor tracks as well as several open-world maps in different climate zones, from mudland to snowy mountains. What makes MX vs ATV particularly fun (and authentic) is the combination of precise controls (including weight shifting) and ground deformation. Only a few games have so far featured the latter (Sega Rally Revo did it best). Every vehicle leaves a track in the ground, changing the surface and making subsequent laps more difficult. This makes for an additional challenge, especially in longer races.Graphics are decent, but it's obvious that the game was made with consoles in mind. The level of texture detail and draw distance are limited, as are filtering and anti-aliasing features.This is a very fun and content-rich offroad racing game that appeals in particular to fans of the old Motocross Madness series.

												Old at this point, but doesn't feel dated. The physics are consistent, the riding is fun and graphics are nice. Menu navigation is a little tedious since it drops you back to beginning of the race selection every time you want to select a race, which is bothersome when you just want to check which races you need to complete for any given circuit. Although this is a minor hindrance and doesn't take from the gameplay, which is quite solid.			"

												mx vs atv reflex is a solid if not a little dated dirt style racing title with a very interesting take on weight and lean control using the right stick to adjust weight as you barrel over cliffs and turns and also the addition of other offraod vehicles not just dirtbikes. i personally had only a few issues with the title mostly being based around the free roam style missions not exactly making it clear on the objective and the invisible walls being a little to common but overall not a bad title and a pretty solid dirt racer.video below

												A friend and I paid full price for this game, which we both agree was steep in regards to the game itself. However, we were able to join eachother for races/freeride no problemo. If our money goes towards continued multiplayer connectivity, we shall consider it worthy of the $22(CDN) price tag.+ The amount of control you have over your bike is on a whole 'nother level. + Throughout a race, the track gets more and more beat up by the bike tires. (Terrain deformation)+ Great customization+ Low system requirements+ Good graphics (on high) with emphasis on vehicle detail.			"

												As others have mentioned, the ""reflex"" system of balance is almost impossible to use. It requires you to move your hand into a different position when using a gamepad. I was wanting this game for quite some time, finally purchased it, only to have it throw an error when starting. After jumping through hoops to get it running, it still throws an error when quitting.UPDATE: Just re-installed this game to give it another chance, my review still stands. I went into arcade mode, drove around for a minute, then the entire game just went black, no sound. I also was unable to modify any game controls. It just seems like this game was ""rushed"" out to placate users while they worked on getting their latest games ready for release.Update 2: Third time was not a charm. After a total of 3 hours of play time, I still am unable to even start my career. My computer should handle this easily, but oh yeah, I have an AMD graphics card, which apparently is not suitable for this game. MX vs. ATV Unleashed runs 5 times better than this game.			"

												Fairly enjoyable game. Graphics are pretty good but a bit dated without any DX specific graphic settings in the game menus.  The highlight of this game is the multiple vehicles and trick physics. Runs at 60fps no problem on my GTX 750. Only downside is certain graphical glitches but they aren't that frequent so far. In the mud bowl area where you learn tricks there seems to be a permanent shadow problem where a flashing shadow runs the whole width of the screen. I also saw a river shoot straight into the air and freeze while racing. Other than this it's been fairly glitch free. I'd give it about a 7.5 out of 10 and get it while it's on sale for 5 or 6 dollars.			"

												The game is excellent and theres actually nothing wrong with it but i bought this game for multyplayer experience and if your only looking for that you wont find any.I tought that because its the only proper motocross game out there that there must be some community still playing it in multyplayer but i have now tried 4 times to find any players for supercross and failed.When trying to quick match it also wont find anyone.The multyplayer for this game is dead.

												Definentaly one of the better offroad games out there. all the vehicles handle great, lots of trick you can do when rideing atv or mx (there are other vehicles in this game other then bikes and atvs), and it definentaly gets your adreniline going. i havent played any of the other games in the series but starting on this one i think it's safe to have high expectation from future installments. only real downside is the online is pretty dead and can sometimes kick you off when you finish a match in private sessions. other that very solid game. 7.5/10			"

They try to kill you 24/7 in Onmnicross, until you buy a big truck that wont flip out if they touch you. Secondly, ther is never anyone on multiplayer. Otherwise great game.			"

												In MX vs ATV Reflex, you get to race a whole load of vehicles, but it's really all about the motorbikes! To start with, I definitely recommend a controller for this game!When you first play this (The motorbike that is), you might be put off by the control system...because it's not like your usual car game where you use one stick for steering. In MX vs ATV you use both. One stick is your steering and the other is your body placement, allowing for full control of your angle when taking a tight corner.Don't let this put you off...stick to it and be patient with learning it, because once you have, it reveals what a satisfying racing and game play experience this title offers. You aren't limited to wining an A to B race, you can throw in awesome tricks (easily pulled off by pressing your left button and moving the right stick mid air), to gain more money allowing you to tweak your rides (better tires, exhausts that affect performance), and looks (both vehicles and rider). Once you've won a race or two in career mode, and tweak your bike with better stuff, your ability to pull off crazy tricks in a race is raised! You don't only get to race against others...there are exploration modes where you motocross your way to different markers on huge maps, and take some challenges. These vary from Hill Climb events, to jump accuracy events and so on..Personally I am glad I purchased this title (got it cheap) but honestly it's enough fun to recommend at full price too. Personal Rating: A fun engrossing racer, with good graphics and satisfying gameplay. Good Graphics, Lots of Mud, and hilarious when you get a stunt wrong and end up face planting into a tree!Percentage Rating: 85% Not for people wanting a quick arcade fix, this is nearly the perfect balance between arcade and simulation!

All the tracks are nicely made, the vehicles are awesome (still would prefer real brands like Kawasaki and KTM, though) and the music is chosen well.

												This game is not the best of the MX Vs ATV franchise but it is still one of the best motorbike games out there. Pros--The difficulties are set to what they actually say (rookie the AI drive off the track at turns, where as the hardest difficulty they will not fall off once)-you will want to keep playing-use of real people in arcade mode  -no P2W in multiplayerCons--The supercoss tracks are absolute S***-some jump take offs are not big enough to get to the supposed landing pad-Money is too easy to get and bikes are too cheap-you cannot freeride on all the tracksThis game did not live up to the standards that I set for it after playing MX vs ATV unleashed.

												Best MX-Game until today. The steering with 2 Controller Sticks feels just right. There ist a huge fanmade collection of Tracks and the multiplayer is still alive. I would definitely recommend this game to every MX-rider :)			"

												Protip: Use a controllerI enjoy MX and ATV games, and this one reminds me of some of the best I've played. Even some of the classic hits. More of an arcade feel here, not so much simulation, but achieves a certain level of realism.Sure, there's a couple issues, like most games... Pros:HEAVY METAL SOUNDTRACK \m/Relatively fun, somewhat intuitive controls*Lots of vehicles (choice of flavors, rather.)Pretty deep character cusomization (wish I could say the same for vehicles)Lots of events, with varying difficulty levelsTear it up in open world like areas (always a great feature)Cons:The physics can be a bit wonky, making the intutive control concept a little difficult to pick up right away.Tricks can be difficult.Audio mix seems off, or lacking quality/depth at times (soundtrack still sounds good though)Some event tracks are repeated for different events in career mode. Seems lazy.A relatively small number of areas in game lack polish, and possibly optimization. I haven't tried any multiplayer modes.I picked up this game on sale, and it was totally worth it for just the soundtrack. If you don't have a MX or ATV game on steam, and it's on sale, pick it up!

												This game doesn't get much action anymore. I understand this as the game is quite old, and outdated. (Respectfully) However, I have never played such a rage inducing steaming pile of awesomeness in my entire life. I lose every race because I am garbage, but that doesn't matter. If you are competetive with your friends, this game will f%&@ you many times over. I recommend this game, because it is a great way to pass time, and ruin many friendships. Good day.			"

												A friend and I paid full price for this game, which we both agree was steep in regards to the game itself. However, we were able to join eachother for races/freeride no problemo. If our money goes towards continued multiplayer connectivity, we shall consider it worthy of the $22(CDN) price tag.+ The amount of control you have over your bike is on a whole 'nother level. + Throughout a race, the track gets more and more beat up by the bike tires. (Terrain deformation)+ Great customization+ Low system requirements+ Good graphics (on high) with emphasis on vehicle detail.			"

												O game Mx vs ATV Reflex é animal. Por mais que tenha sido lançado em 2010, é animal. Para quem quer ficar fazendo manobra de boa, sem ficar fazendo missão, só zoando mesmo, tem o modo free ride. Pra quem quer jogar mais sério tem MUITA corrida, muita mesmo. E além do mais, tem o multiplayer que é animal. Recomendo o game, e pelo preço que tá, vale a pena :D			"

												This game is honestly one of the most fun ones I have played this year. Even though it came out like super many years ago, it still holds up well today and it has also aged well.Buy it if you want a good MX game, this one is probably the best of them all.Just don't try to play it without a gamepad ;)			"

												As others have mentioned, the ""reflex"" system of balance is almost impossible to use. It requires you to move your hand into a different position when using a gamepad. I was wanting this game for quite some time, finally purchased it, only to have it throw an error when starting. After jumping through hoops to get it running, it still throws an error when quitting.UPDATE: Just re-installed this game to give it another chance, my review still stands. I went into arcade mode, drove around for a minute, then the entire game just went black, no sound. I also was unable to modify any game controls. It just seems like this game was ""rushed"" out to placate users while they worked on getting their latest games ready for release.Update 2: Third time was not a charm. After a total of 3 hours of play time, I still am unable to even start my career. My computer should handle this easily, but oh yeah, I have an AMD graphics card, which apparently is not suitable for this game. MX vs. ATV Unleashed runs 5 times better than this game.			"

												After months of playing this game, it still keeps me coming back. It really does have everything... dirtbikes, mud trucks, ATV's... There really is no limit to the replay value and the total fun factor this game has.This really gets damn close to one of the best and most entertaining games I've ever played!  :DNote to the devs: How about a Winter Edition? Snowmobiles!!!I would definitely support those efforts and buy a copy... :)			"

												This game is so fun on its own I probably played 200 hours atleast on ps3 with me and my friend splitscreening it up, but then I got it on PC and HOLY MOLY..... MODS soooo much time can be spent just looking through all the different bike skins, tracks and man are there some tracks that a badass and if you dont like what you can see you can make your own mods, making tracks is a bit more difficult but making bike graphics is sooo easy and fun. I feel ive gotten my 20$ out of it and I am not playing it much anymore but man oh man did I used to. Also having some friends to battle with just adds to the fun			"

												To be honest this game is nothing speacial aside from being able to crontrol the bike and rider each independatly.The main reason i purcased this game was because of replayabilitly and multiplayer with freinds. Simple things like the warm up area will have you coming back a couple times every few weeks.			"

												Great soundtrack. Plenty of detail and variety in terrain and tracks to keep things interesting.Player skill has lot of effect in gameplay, not just for finding racing lines but keep your rider upright and moving at highest speed possible. Various interesting challenges and tricks. Messing around in free ride can be fun too.Menus should be clearer somehow, just finding different class vehicles or upgrades can be odd.Keeps you coming back for more. Recommended, good value for money.			"

												This is one of the best, if not the best Motocross/Supercross games I have ever played. The physics and controls are far more superior than most games I've played. Plus, the wear and tear on the tracks, including ruts, make it even more enjoyable. This is alos one of the best games for customization of your rider, I just wish you could change your plates on the bike. Buy this if you want to play a challenging but fun game, I highly recommend it if you're into Motocross/Supercross games!			"

												Dear Arceus I love this game! It's so fun and different from other of the Mx games with testing your Reflex and making sure you don't break your neck. The cool part is a trail will be formed from the vehicles which shows the programmers care about details. And there are a bunch of recognizable pro riders, ex: Ricky Carmichael. Buy this game.			"
