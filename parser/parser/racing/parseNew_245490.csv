												It could be a good game... Not the best one, but good. But it's not even good. Because Ubisoft.Uplay? Check.Microtransactions? Check.Season pass that don't include all DLCs? Check.Multiplayer that was added after all DLCs? Check. Most players just moved on already.Also the game has much worse optimisation than Trials Evolution, a lot less stable and so on. Just be aware that you might not be able to launch it at all because reasons.The main problem is that Trials Fusion isn't exactly the most creative game... It's just another sequel just like Ubisoft likes it - bland unispiring game with exactly the same visuals and gameplay with a bunch of gimmicks and extensive marketing campaign on top.Trials Evolution was just better game overall. It was just that - complete package without gimmicks, a really great and all round polished game in which developers cleary put their love and soul. And Trials Fusion is just a second-rate game that only exists to get your money, Ubi-business as always.			"

												This game is my go to time killer, it's not for everyone though.You should NOT buy this game IF you don't like spending  hours trying to perfect a level, or use 30 minutes on a level and then have the  game tell you that you took too long.Although this game is so rewarding when you pull off that insanely difficult  jump, or when you beat everyones high score. This is a time waster, if you make it through to the extreme maps, then I'd say good luck. The difficulty of the game ranges from beginner, easy, normal, hard, extreme. When you are on the beginner maps you'll blast through the  levels, although when you move up, it'll of  course get harder - a lot harder. The game has 1  big bug which could put you off buying it though. It's that low fps cause a slowmotion effect, which renders the game more or less unplayable. A solution is to lower the settings, but i'd just like to include this.  The DLC that's out so far (3 out of 6 planned)  they're all worth picking up IF you like the game. I'd say they're more difficult than the other maps, but not by much. In each DLC  you get atleast 9 new trails. I think you'd have to be a person that wants to get the best medal on everything to justify the 5€ price tag though.I personally love this game when I need to take a break from everything. It's calming and frustrating in a weird sort of way.			"

												In my opinion this game stands on its own as a Trials game, but there are a few things that I hate about it and force me to not recommend it. First up is Uplay. Everyone hates Uplay. There are never any players online, so there goes that whole section of gameplay... there's never anybody to play with.The DLC is just a huge money grab. The game by itself doesn't have enough content to justify the $19.99 price tag. I paid it and expected a lot... I got a little with the offer to pay more to get tracks that should have come with the game. That extra $19.99 for the season pass seems steep, because it is. $40 for a ""complete"" game that doesn't have much depth or the replayability of the older Trials games is a rip off. If the DLC (which should have come with the game anyways) was included in the original price, I would be more apt to recommend it.Screw Ubisoft for being so greedy, and for forcing Uplay on the innocent.

												Please take time to read the whole review...Don't get me wrong, by itself Trials Fusion is a decent game - Great graphics, great scenery and keeps the elements of its predecessors without changing too much. However, as a person who has dedicated over 120 hours into Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I must say that Fusion is pretty underwhelming compared to it.First of all, there are significantly fewer levels in this game than there are in TEGE - it took me at least 20 hours to get the medal tally required to unlock the platinum medals, but in Fusion it only took me 4 hours. It definitely felt like a step backwards in content.This leads to the next point - Ubisoft decided that in order for us to get more levels, we'd have to fork out money for a season pass. That's right, they took our beloved Trials franchise and decided to include DLC in it. It definitely feels like a dog move against us.Lastly, they decided to leave out the most essential feature when they released this game - online multiplayer! And only this year they decide they're finally going to release it? Pretty crap if you ask me.Final verdict - If you have played Trials Evolution Gold Edition for a while and feel like playing some new, different levels, buy this game when it's on sale, as if you ignore all of its flaws it's a pretty good game.If you have never played a trials game before, buy Trials Evolution Gold Edition as it is a lot more fun to play than this game.

												Sale edit: Every DLC is on sale right now, this hasn't happened before, so take the very low price into account with my DLC reviews :)Awesome level MAX Edit: This isn't included in the season pass, and as yet I do not own it. I'll update this section with details on whether the DLC is worth a full price or not when I purchase it for myself. As for the introduced microtransactions, they're purely cosmetic and not required.IntroductionThis was the first Trials game I ever played, and it's great. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, most of them are negative simply because it uses Uplay, which I shall talk about further down the review.SettingFirst off, the environment in this game is stunning. For a game like Trials, in which you just ride your bike across level after level, you wouldn't expect this level of quality, the world looks like it's part of a much larger game. There's also plenty of variety, as you quickly move from the futuristic city to platforms in the sky, ancient ruins, outdoor courses, underwater bases and even the planet's core. There is also some slight hints of story included through a few characters talking throughout the game, which hint at how the world became like this. Gameplay It's trials. You drive your bike, tilt your weight and try to make it to the end as fast as possible and with as few failures as possible. Every level also has three challenges that encourage you to play differently, and some even involve minigames entirely different to how the game is usually played. The difficulty as you pass through the levels is done very well. By the time I was met with much harder obstacles, I'd already got a basic idea of how to surpass them, and not once did a death feel cheap.DLCThe DLCs add some nice extra content that also gives you a look at more of the world of Fusion, and provide some decent challenge. I wouldn't recommend buying them seperately, but if you don't want to buy the Deluxe Edition, here's a summary of their content and quality:2/10/15 Edit: Read the Deluxe Edition section for my opinion on prices! Riders of the Rustlands The first DLC and the weakest. Featuring only 6 levels, an FMX course and a mediocre minigame. - Not really worth £4 compared to the other DLCs, skip this one and get another. Empire of the Sky Same as above, 6 levels, FMX and a minigame. The levels are a bit better than Rustlands, but still not worth £4. If you've beat the game and want some more fun, get this DLC. Otherwise you can ignore it. Welcome to the Abyss Breaks the chain and includes 8 levels instead of 6, as well as the FMX and minigame at the end. This DLC gives an interesting look at an underwater empire that used to live under the ocean. Some story is delivered through another AI who speaks to you at certain points. The levels are of a higher standard than the first two DLCs, and I think barely justifies its £4 pricetag. Fire in the deep 9 levels, FMX and a minigame. In this DLC you are even further down, underneath the planet's core. As you move from level to level you go further underground, giving a nice indication of your progress through the DLC. There are also multiple secret recordings hidden around the levels, which give some extra information about the world, and what went on in the mines. Worth it. Fault One Zero Personally, I believe this is the best DLC. It drops one level and returns to 8 trials again, but the quality of the levels steps up greatly. This DLC has a focus on technology, much more so than previously shown, with teleporters, anti gravity machines and Mechs featuring. The levels in this DLC are very inventive, including  one that repeatedly glitches between looking normal, and a blue cyberspace-esque environment and  an interesting level in which you drive around inside three arcade machines! This DLC is definitely worth £4. After the Incident The sixth and final DLC. Same as above, 8 levels with an FMX and Minigame. One of my main disapointments with Trials Fusion was the lack of detail as to what was happening. I understand that this is a game solely based on a random guy riding a bike through obstacle courses, but with such an interesting world, with many deeper story elements hinted at throughout, I really wanted to learn more. After the Incident does so nicely. It's set in the future, when all the world is in ruins after the aforementioned ""Incident"". The levels all focus on fairly different areas, all destroyed or going through some form of crisis. Similar to Fire in the Deep, you can find secrets in the levels, which give you some backstory as to how all of this started. The way this is done is great, as  SynDI talks to you through a dating game text box, with amusing exagerated changes in her expression as she talks. If you want to know more about the world behind Fusion, or just want to play even more levels, this DLC is worth the money. Deluxe Edition  I'd like to point out that this game has gone on multiple sales, but not a single time have the DLC packs gone on discount themselves, and it doesn't look like they will at any time unfortunately. --In the most recent sale at the time of writing, all DLCs aside from Awesome Level MAX have been reduced to 99p, so I'd definitely recommend waiting for a sale before purchasing any DLCs-- As such, I highly recommend you get the Deluxe edition during a sale, I managed to pick it up for £10. Otherwise, if you beat the game and decide you want more, you will be paying a much higher price. Say you got the base game on sale for £6. Now if you got three of the DLCs, that'll cost you an extra £12. Half the DLC total DLC and you've spent £18 already. The Deluxe edition is a much better purchase (During a sale of course. The DLC is good but not worth £30!)Why the negative reviews?Now, there are three main flaws that have gave this game so many negative reviews. First main point is the multiplayer. I played the game entirely solo and had fun, I can't really comment on it.Secondly, people seem to be complaining about this being a bad port, and having a many performance issues. For reference, I ran the game on an i5 3570k, 8gb RAM and a GTX 770 with constant 60fps and no issues of any kind. The issue may be related to lower-end machines.And as for the last point, UPlay. The majority of these reviews are from people starting the game, seeing Uplay, closing it and leaving a bad review. I will say right here that if you avoid this game because of Uplay, you are stupid. But UPlay sucks! The impact of UPlay is nowhere near as bad as the reviews make it sound. You start the game on Steam, UPlay appears, takes a couple seconds to log in, then minimizes and starts the game. You only need to interact with it once in order to create an account, and after that you don't need to touch the thing, aside from closing it when you are done.EDIT: UPlay now does not even appear when you start a game through Steam. It minimizes itself. Seriously guys, the impact is so minimal it's not even worth arguing about!ConclusionAll in all, I recommend Trials Fusion to anyone who is an existing trials fan, or enjoys 2D games with high difficulty. Though the price is a little steep for the content on offer, so I'd suggest waiting for a sale and getting the deluxe edition. As earlier stated, it's much better value as the DLCs never get discounted, and only costed £4 (the price of a single DLC) more than the normal pack in the latest sale. And finally, do not avoid this game because of UPlay, there is no reason to.			"

												This game worked for a while, now it crashes on startup. Ubisoft support is terrible, all the recommendations given where not only worthless but wrong. Uplay sucks. And the business model with bad and overpriced dlc is the cherry on the top. Don't buy from ubisoft, vote with your dollar.			"

												i think it's pretty damn crappy that you can buy the season pass and yet they still withold content from you. although, admittedly, said content is pretty f'ing stupid. and i only know this because the awesome max edition was on, like 80% discount for a very short time when it came out, so i bought it for one of my other pc's.other than that, it's an ok game, i guess. worthwhile at 75% discounted price. notwithstanding that, i advise against purchasing this game because there's an unbelievable amount of recycling in the race courses.and, quite naturally, this game, which the customer pays for outright, has been infected with the dreaded microtransactions which were supposed to be reserved strictly for the free2play business model. very, F'ing, shady.also, i unlocked almost everything in this game in about fifteen hours of play.Red Lynx has sold their souls to ubisoft and i won't be giving them any more of my money.in case you feel the urge to contradict me on any of these points, don't waste your time, i'm not here for conversation. this section was provided for me by steam to state my opinion and i won't stand for anyone to come here and offer me their review of my review.so, you can keep your critiques to yourselves and simply move along.

												This game's alright... I'm not at all alright while playing it, but I still love it. After the rage wears off, the game gives you a good sense of accomplishment when you finally get that 0 fault gold medal run, especially on later (hard) stages.While Trials Fusion is a streamlined trials game (it is much, much easier than Evolution), there is still a good amount of hard tracks in the base game, and a few of them only the most persistent players will be able to ""gold medal"" (while others will rage quit out of the game and write a review...). There are 8 zones in the base game, and each one has 6 to 10 tracks in it (8 on average), that number is significantly increased with the season pass, which adds 6 new zones. Right now, 9/10/2014, the season pass only offers 3 zones, with 3 more on the way before May 2015. The game also includes a track editor, so you can create your own tracks, and you can easily access and play tracks built by other people online (which are pretty impressive from what I've seen/played).Now I'm not a big fan of Ubisoft's PC releases, because I usually get hit by poor optimization issues that plague a lot of their games at release, this game's performance however, pleasantly surprised me and put a big fat smile on my face, after the stutter fest that was Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I wasn't very hopeful going into this one. The game runs perfectly smooth maxed out on my machine, and the only stutter I got was on a graphically intensive track, while I had 2 video streams running in the background, after trying the same track without flash videos hogging my cpu, the stutter went away, and the game ran buttery smooth again.For reference, my PC specs are:i7 920 @3Ghzgtx660ti 2gb8gb ramwin7 64bitIt's worth mentioning that the game has a pretty good, yet weird sense of humor, for example whenever you finish a track, something funny and dumb is sure to happen, like the rider falling of his bike after he crosses the finish line, landing in the water and racing a cruise ship, or when you cross a finish line that's on top of a 2 story hut, the door closes behind you, and the hut starts flying off like a rocket. I also really enjoy the AI commentary (I guess you can call them the narrators), and the biker's yells and woohoos remind me of Homer Simpson.This game is a steal even at full price, and on a decent sale it should be a no-brainer if you played and liked previous Trials games, but I'm sure 2D platformer game enthusiasts would love it as well. As for the score, I'm giving it a 9/10.			"

												Trials Fusion is just a mindless blast of fun and mayhem. Get some friends together and it only multiplies it, but it's solid even by itself.Here's a video showcasing my shenanigans in this game for those who are curious. If not, just read the rest of the review below.


YouTube™ Video: Trials Fusion: Quick Look 

			Views: 2,146		

			Noble of Lost Pause takes a fun quick look at Trials Fusion. Watch gravity be the hardest boss in the game!		

I'll start by saying the gameplay is pretty simple, but challenging at the same time. The only thing you're doing is balancing your rider and your bike along a path while pounding the gas. However, the balancing part is the main problem and where all the challenge lies. The courses have you flying and leaping over all sorts of nonsensical obstacles, and landing it perfectly just doesn't happen sometimes. Even more so when you're trying to show off in front of your friends and botch the trick. But in my personal opinion, it's more fun failing than it actually is succeeding. It's hilarious watching my rider flop around because I was being a dope and got overzealous in my flips, which is a huge boon to the game because you're having a blast whether you're succeeding or failing miserably like I do sometimes.The game also doesn't feel cheap, nor feel like it cheats you out of anything. It's easy enough to get a silver medal on most tracks, but getting a gold is never too out of reach. It saddens me a little that doing tricks doesn't net you anything special besides cool points for yourself, but at the same time, it's one less thing I have to worry about if all I'm trying to do is unlock things. It allows you to play the game the way you want to, and having more options of playing the game is always better.And even when you run out of tracks to do in the game, there is a track creation tool that can make more and be shared with the comminity, so you don't have to worry about stuff to do. The game is even getting DLC in the future with more tracks if community stuff isn't your thing, so there's an option for you there as well.As far as negatives go, my complaints are very minor. While the stages themselves look amazing, all the stuff that's happening sometimes can be a little distracting from what you're doing. Or sometimes even the reverse is true, that you're so focused on your bike, you don't notice all the stuff happening around you when you want to see it. Another thing is that all of the stuff happeing in the background doesn't really effect what you're doing in the foreground. It's just fluff. I think it would've added a bit more diversity and dynamics if the stage interacted with the rider more.There's also still a few bugs in the game or poor optimization. When I went to the create tool, it locked up my comp, which is a beast and shouldn't have any trouble loading anything. The same goes with how long it takes to select a ride at the beginning of the stages. I just stare at a black screen for a good while before something eventually pops up. But thankfully you can just press A to go to the course regardless, so it isn't that big of a deal.So to sum it up, for 20 dollars, you're gonna have a blast with this title. It looks good, feels good, has a great sense of humor (the endings and the announcer make me laugh quite a bit), has potential to grow, and is fun with friends. Definitely pick this up, even more so when it goes on sale.			"

												I am heartily disappointed with this game. The previous two Trials games were great; full of content, great level design, simple but effective layout/gameplay/difficulty levels. Trials Fusion offers an infuriatingly bad soundtrack, a forced 'story' and setting, an SSX style 'tricks' dealy that is hardly utilised, a redundant multiplayer mode etc etcNot to mention the fact that the game is largely hidden behind a season pass paywall. That means £32 for all of the content. Most of which is probably terrible. What a load of paywall bull***t! Also: Uplay. Thanks for nothing Ubisoft and associated sell-outs.			"

												as much as I love the the Trials series, I can't recommend this game to people. I'll play the living hell out of it because I'm obsessed with the series, but it takes a very specific kind of person to really squeeze 50 dollars of play value out of this (base game + all DLC).Ubisoft really did some damage to the series and this game hardly stands well against previous games in the series. I still believe Trials HD is the best in the series, but that's more a personal opinion. I would recommend checking out the previous game, Trials Evolution Gold Edition, rather than settling on Fusion. Although the multiplayer is still rather empty, it's still a more down-to-earth title that keeps a lot of the aesthetics that make the Trials series so great. Plus it has way more tracks in the base game than Fusion does.			"

												When the game would suffer any drop in FPS it decides to run in Slow motion. Making it unplayable. Bugs are riddled throughout, Crashing frequently. Being forced to use uPlay you will also be plagued with another service that does not function. and thus removes a loarge proportion of the game as uPlay is unreliable. You must also then wait at every option for the game to attempt to connect to Ubisoft, wasting you time as you are told what you already know, that ubisoft is unavailable.On top of the game being unplayable for a lot of people, The Deluxe edition with the ason pass has not been transfering across with Uplay, meaning that the Season pass unlocks are still Locked.Do not buy untill the game is fixed.

												If you would kindly ignore all ""not recommended"" reviews as 10.5 hours on record is not enough gameplay time to write a snotty review and downgrade a now perfect game.  The DLC is worth every penny, for £19.99 you are technically getting another game in terms of tracks, 200+ extra objects to create your own track with, aside from the 100+ items you already get to start with, and the imagination of the creators of tracks in terms of things that move, explode, sink and even appear, giving you even less time to plan the next trial.I have 242 hours on record and a relative has 1000+ hours.  You can't complain if the game is too difficult, if you want the platinum medal?.  You have to grind each track to earn it.In short, this is a underrated and unappreciated gaming masterpiece! "

												Trials Fusion is just like Trials 2 and Trials Evolution but set in a semi-futuristic world. Does it do anything new ? Apart from a couple of decent looking tracks, not really, no. Next to these new tracks you have your licenses, stunts, mini-games and character customization. All the things you would expect from a sequel. But at least it doesn't run as poorly as Evolution did.Is it any easier ? Hell no. And that's the magic of Trials.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Hmm Where do I start? It has bikes, a screaming guy, the most hilarious tricksystem I've ever seen, and FUUUTUREEEEE!!!For the people that owned Trials Evolution:If you had a fun time with Trials Evolution I'm 100% sure you'll love Fusion, the game has been revamped, a whole set of new bikes, new courses, a new world, new music, and CHALLENGES !In summary, if you love Evolution, Fusion is no difference, its familiar, funky music, new bikes, tracks and what not.For the people that are new to the Trials series:Let me tell you that this game is not for the fainted hearts, this game is easy but it gets tougher and tougher, until you say F*ck this I quit. Ofcourse, the more you'll play the more you'll get familiar with the physics on the bike, the tracks and other useful tips and tricks you'll pick up on while playing.- I highly recommend playing this with a controller, either Xbox or PS3 (Get an emulator that emulates your ps3 controller to x360) Because while progressing through the game, there are a lot of climbs, bunnyhops and other hard tricks you'll have to pull of precise in order to place some good times on the scoreboard and finishing faultless, therefore I'd highly recommend a controller more than a clunky keyboard.- The game looks really colorful, it's like a rainbow took a♥♥♥♥♥♥on the game, thats how colorful it is, and it's pretty, really pretty.Its an absolute joy and feast for your eyes.Never the less screw the graphics cuz gameplay > graphics amirite? If you said no then smh.- The game starts easily like I said but when progressing it gets more difficult on a level of ""Not finishable"" If you're brand new and having issues with this platformer.The physics play a huge roll in this game which is why it takes skill to successfully and flawlessly play and finish this game.- Challenges that have been added in the game, which are mini tasks you CAN do (Not need to) for extra XP are also lots of fun and sometimes really stressful. They make you feel super happy once you've completed it. They make you feel annoyed and boiling when you screw it up in the end.Note: I suck at reviews, never done one but I'm just typing whatever comes to mind and what I would like to know about a game I'm willing to buy.- Customisation has been redone, you can now pick from multiple sets of ""armor/suits"" that are unlockable by finishing tracks, earning xp or doing certain tasks. The only negative thing that I can think of is that you can not save the color you have picked for example on your shirt, to match that with your pants/helmet... Customisation is a cool addon, also the bikes are again modifyable (if that's a word >.<) in which you unlock bodykits and wheels to customize them. That's pretty cool if you ask me.- Two slightly annoying things that I've noticed while playing this (Also been confirmed by other friends that play trials) The loading time on the Garage/customisation takes a while (10-20s) so that could be a little issue if you're inpatient.- If you do happen to buy the game, let me tell you ""WELCOME TO THE FUTURE"" on every single start up. It makes me laugh but can get annoying if you pick up on it.In summary: The game handles great, controller recommended, great visuals, easy to pick up and play, hard to master, great value with a lot of grinding on challenges that are added to each and EVERY track (Yes even extreme tracks). If you're still not sure I recommend reading some other reviews that are more helpful than mine isI tried my best >:3Thank you			"

												Trials Fusion is the latest installment in what has generally been a game that offers a simple premise but provides a lot of gameplay punch.  While there aspects of Fusion that I am greatly impressed with, there are a few things that I am unhappy with. For those unfamiliar, the Trials games are a very simple premise. You're riding a motorbike (along with other vehicles in Fusion) across a large variety of tracks with physics being the ultimate gameplay component. You have to control the bike properly or you will wipe out.....A LOT!I've broken this into a simple pros/cons list for anyone that has tl;dr issues :-)Pros:+ Looks fantastic. The colors are rich and have real pop to them. If you can play this in Ultra at the highest resolution you're in for a treat, even at lower resolutions it still is great eye candy+ Base game course design is interesting for the most part and the futuristic setting adds more than I thought it would.+ Trick/FX gameplay styles really add to the depth and encourage playing tracks multiple times with both fastest times and trick scores being seperate goals.+ A ton of community made tracks at your fingertips.Cons:- Pricey DLC with the season pass costing the same price as the base game making MSRP for both base and season pass (a.k.a. Deluxe Edition) just $20 less than a AAA title. There have been two DLC packs released thus far with more to come.- Some base game courses are much shorter than you'd expect.- Lacks the challenge at the lower levels that earlier Trials titles brought. Seems watered down for casuals/newcomers in respects. The physics are still brutal depending on course, but definitely easier to get the hang of. ATVs are disgustingly easy.-  Four months after release and online multiplayer is still not in the game, yet is promised by the developer. This is UNACCEPTABLE when being advertised as having multiplayer especially at the cost of the full package. Local multiplayer only at the moment (8/23/14 is the date of this review).- Tedious unlocking system.- There seems to be some measure of a ""story"" mode to the single player game where you're regularly spoken to by a female AI similar to GlaDOS of the Portal games, except the Trials AI lady lacks the wit of that classic character and is generally just grating.Let me be clear, while my cons are glaring, I do not regret my purchase of this game. I have a real soft spot for this series and have gotten a lot of mileage out of the earlier titles and am going to continue to play this one as it plays well and I can't overstate how great it looks. I was first introduced to Trials when it came out on Xbox 360 Arcade and I put well over 100 hours into that iteration of the game. I hesitated on this new one until I upgraded my hardware and now that I have, I am very glad I waited at least until then.  That being said, unless you are like me and a fan of the Trials series and know what you're getting into, do yourself a favor and hold off until this is on sale. I recommend this with a caveat. Definitely pick it up when on sale, but unless you're really into the series/gameplay style, you're fine waiting. "

												TL;DR: Looks good, includes interesting features with a lot of community interaction and fun gameplay, however there are issues such as Uplay, large quantities of DLC and optimisation problems.This is the first Trials game that I have ever played or owned, having heard good things from previous instalments I picked it up on sale. After finishing half of the game (excluding DLC) I felt that I could make an opinion on the package.Positive features:-Nice colourful graphics-Fun challenging core gameplay-Level creation functionality and user created maps-Interesting concepts e.g. the ability to perform tricksNegative features:-Uplay is required-The music is bland-DLC is frequent and costly-Issues with performance in certain instancesTo conclude, while not a bad game, Trials Fusion left me with an unsatisfied; while exciting to begin with the experience lost me and was never able to recapture my enthusiasm. If it's on sale it might be worth picking up if this style of game interests you.			"

												This is basically the same game as Trials Evolution, but this time around we got the DLC on PC, which means boatloads of new options in user-made tracks. The people at Ubi / Redlynx finally started updating Track Central with manually converted console (XB1, PS4, X360) tracks so you have cool new challenging tracks to play every week. Single-line multiplayer is finally here too, and it's functional. This is a thumbs up if you have a few friends to multi with and compare scores.			"

												Trials Fusion is a work of beauty.I may not be an aficionado, having only spent ~100 hours playing the original.  Mostly by myself, but often with friends, loving every second of it.  I've probably crashed 100,000 times, but I have a few accomplishments in the more extreme trials that I'm proud of.If that describes your love of the game, then you will like this one too.  I've read that some people have problems with framerates, but I have not.  The video options allow for a lot of tweaking to match your video card's capabilities it seems.  I have 18 hours clocked on Trials Fusion at the time of writing this review.			"

												This is not a terrible game by any means, but it feels like a definite step back from the previous installment and, by comparison especially, a lousy value proposition.The tracks are significantly fewer and blander, and that's not balanced out by the new mechanisms.Doing tricks seems to be based on your angle and the input on the right stick, but it feels pretty sketchy/inconsistent. The stages built around doing those tricks for points are too unforgiving: the checkpointing means you only get one shot at each jump trick, so any failed attempt means you've lost a potential 20% or so points for that stage. Maybe losing your multiplier would have been enough of a deterrent; as it stands, falling is too easy and too costly, so it makes sense to play it safe -- and that's boring, especially for a mode that's supposed to be a bit more crazy than the precision driving at the core of the franchise. Uniracers did it first and better, basically.'Challenges' are either Easter eggs hard to figure out without a guide, or require feats like finishing with zero fault while doing 10 tricks or never letting go of the gas pedal. That's one way to stretch playtime over a small number of tracks...Tournaments are one thing that's improved, though: they're time-limited and renewed every few hours, which is a good encouragement to participate and try to rank high.Now that the first piece of DLC (out of a planned 6) is out, it's obvious that we can't count on them to fix the fundamental problem of there not being enough content: each will be the size of a world, so 6 regular tracks and 2 gimmicky ones (and the first pack is boring like the rest, too).Are RedLynx / Ubi counting on player-created content to pick up the slack? Trying to find really good content is still a crapshoot though -- you can only rely on the 'featured' categories, very basic filters, or a percentage of positive reviews. There's quite a few enjoyable enough tracks, some with clever moments, but few if any are comparable in quality to the dev-made tracks from Trials Evolution, and you have to be in the mood to rummage around for them.It pains me to say it, but this is a disappointment. Just get Trials Evolution, and don't get Fusion until you've played so much Evo you're sick of it. And even then, be aware it's not great value at full price.			"

												A great new entry in the line of Trials games.A unique and addictive mix of puzzle, physics and racing; which RedLynx has been mastering for what must be a decade now. I've been playing the RedLynx trials games since waaay back when they were just 2D Flash games; so they've come a looong way.However - I ride a motorcycle daily, still do trials biking on my bicycle, and have ridden actual Trials motorcycles, and I actually prefer the handling of it's predecessor: ""Trials Evolution"".PROSThe prettiest graphics of any Trials game to date; with fantastic gameplay to match.There's a wide range of beautiful environments and props for you to not only race in, but also create your own tracks in (with a bewildering amount of customisation). Your rides and riders can be personalised too, with (most) items being unlocked with progress and paid for with the in-game currency you earn. The rider can now do tricks in midair (once you unlock them) for that extra XP and show(off)manship. Tracks are varied, clever and engaging. And for those hardcore completionists, there's three side achievements for every track which range from simple to-dos to entire minigames. Lots of extra fun and value. Oh, and in case you didn't know, there are also Online and Local multiplayer modes too.CONSHandling that can be hard to understand and predict.I will say, the bikes move at a more realistic pace than ever before, feeling like they have real weight an inertia. But hit a bump or land from a drop, and sometimes those physics go out the window with a bike that surges and bounces like a space hopper, or jams/judders in a way that seems to stall the bike. Evolution had a bit of this too, but it made sense as the bikes felt light and twitchy. But when a hefty bike does it, it's hard to react, and harder to counter (the heavier bikes mean less airborne control). Performance also struggles too - The game isn't overly complicated, but it seems quite demanding on CPU and GPU power for what you get.OVERALLA great time wasting and skill honing game for people of all ages and gaming levels. Definitely worth buying if you see it on sale, but you may as well skip Steam and get in from uPlay directly (as you have to use uPlay anyway). However, if you're rig isn't very powerful, you'd be better served getting Trials Evolution - it's just as much fun, and probably better value.			"

												Trials Fusion is a perfect time killer because you'll be playing and retrying all the tracks multiple times to get the best times. Thanks to the great bike physics this series is known for, the game is the very definition of “easy to learn, hard to master” and “trial and error”. So it requires a certain degree skill to fully enjoy but in my opinion it is extremely satisfying to see yourself getting better and beating that one hard track you've been stuck for so long.The game is not without it's problems: Uplay is mandatory and still a piece of sh*t that nobody wants, micro-transactions (luckily only for cosmetics), DLCs are pretty expensive for the amount of content they offer (best get them on sale), multiplayer is dead due to being added really late paired with PC having lowest audience for Trials games and also a controller is required because keyboard controls are next to useless.Many Trials veterans say that Evolution is better and more worth playing over Fusion for various reasons and they're probably right but I wouldn't know since I never got into Evolution when it came out on PC. The futuristic setting, electronic music and the ambiguous hidden story of Fusion was more interesting to me than bland old warehouses in a desert valley accompanied by rock music...But I'm in the minority who cares about that stuff so this review is simply from a Trials noob who enjoy the game for what it is despite it's faults :)			"

The intro makes you so hyped to play this game Now if you have a microwave as a computer 1. You get to wacth a loading screen 2. you get past the loading screen like finally give me the good stuff and then There is an update 3. after Update u cannot play it just keeps crashing 4.If your computer isnt a complete microwave you get past the update then uplay comes along and you need a new account... or maybe this is just me. 5. you might be able to play it for a month but next update ur game wont open again So i Would recomend this game if your computer isnt from the microwave store Wave's are us like mine.

												Being a trails fan ever since the relase of HD, I was incredibly excited to get this.But of course, whenever i try to play the actual game, I only get around 15 fps at most. Looking at the system requirements, everything seemed a-okay except for my graphics card, which at the time wasnt a huge issue for me as id play on the lowest settings. With games that I dont have the expected graphics card for, all I did was that, and they ran fine.Except for this game.Even with the absolute lowest settings I lag like hell. The lag is so unbearable that it goes in slow motion, making it absolutly impossible to play at all. Ive never had any problems with this in the past.Im going to possibly try to get another graphics card to fix the issue. But until then, I can't reccomend this to anyone.ALSO, Uplay is the most useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ever.			"

												Two main points.1. I hate that this uses Uplay2. I absolutely love this game.Uplay can be a hassle to deal with, but its nothing compared to how great this game is. The controls are super smooth with a game pad (once you get used to the game physics) and the game itself is gorgeous. I was worried the scenes might get boring and redundant, but the devs did a fantastic job at keeping things fresh. While most levels are an off the center third person view, almost looking over the shoulder, some levels are unique in their views such as the sunrise level (which looks stunning). In addition, I've found some cool easter eggs as well. Wonderful game, but could do without Uplay. Totally worth buying. Seriously. Do it.			"

Daily competitions for varing rewards, every map in the campaign has 3 challenges to complete that are so random and unrelated to riding you will be asking wtf but in a good way.

It´s competing when you get to the extreme tracks, but even after 3000 attempts on one track, i won´t stop playing until it´s done.Have fun riding!			"

												A pretty decent game overall, with good graphics, but it is VERY DLC-heavy. Although you can play just fine without buying any DLC, it is a bit annoying constantly seeing ""buy this!"" on most screens in the game. 8/10 would reccomend.			"

												I don't know why there are not recommendeds. They just don't know how to get past the uplay screen. List of good things:*Free 25+ known tracks by me that you need nothing for the online ones (I daubt that makes sense though).*Multiple tracks for no extra purchase (purchase season pass for 4 or something extra worlds for fun).*Getting used to uplay was easy for me, try to enter twice before game starts.*You know, for fun.

												This Game makes so much fun, if you loved Trials Evolution you will also like this.I don`t care about Uplay, and they fixed a lot of bugs (at least for me, no slow motion anymore).For now this game has only a Local Multiplayer but they will add Online Multiplayer later, so if you care about Online Matches, waite for it.From me this Game get a 9 of 10 Points now.

												I'd love to hate this game, but I simply can't. As the matter of fact - I love it. At least the first 30 minutes of each gameplay session, until frustration takes the best of me. Unlike other titles, where frustration comes from bad gameplay mechanics, clunky controls or just plain bugs - this game has none of those. Frustration comes only from your own mistakes and lack of focus and patience. I had no problem with the BEGINNER and EASY difficulty mode tracks, whereas in MEDIUM, I first took the time to learn the track and adapt to the ever-changing layout. HARD is where things got really painful. Let's just say that I had to repeat one track a hundred times to get the gold medal. Frustration was followed by a great sense of achievement. I find the new FMX trick system fun, but very difficult or just needed to get used to. One more problem, mentioned by most Steam users: Uplay. Being forced to use two types of DRM is ridiculous and Uplay sucks in general. Sometimes it takes ages to load certain data (bikes, rider accessories and the list of tracks) from the cloud. I bought this game mainly for the purpose of local co-op so I was devastated to find out that you weren't able to play the user-created tracks with your friends. After the latest patch they finally implemented that feature so hopefully we'll have more than the default 10 tracks to enjoy. To sum things up, I enjoy most of the features of Trials: Fusion. Just two things need to go: my lack of skill and Uplay. 9/10			"

												Even though the original Trials games fell flat for me, feeling repetitive and lacking in anything resembling an interesting challenge in most of the levels, I nevertheless picked up Fusion after watching some videos of it.After spending two hours on it(which is a about 30-40% through the career mode), I can safely say this is an improvement in every area. The levels are so much more varied and much more entertaining, and Redlynx has really realised that going for low-light environments is a terrible idea. The new levels are bright, futuristic, and so much fun to traverse.Even the soundtrack got a massive beauty treatment; Petri Alanko, famous for his work on Alan Wake, provided an absolutely astonishing lineup of music that sets the mood.

												I recommend Trials Fusion the game, but Trials Fusion for PC is a scam. The game doesn't run properly, it doesn't matter how good your PC is, it's port to the PC is the wost I've ever seen. It's practically unplayable. Trials is all about reaction and skill, imagine how hard it is when the game is constantly dropping to 15-20 fps and going slow motion below 60. The famerate is all over the place at all times for every track. So basically, have fun trying to control your rider as the game is frequently changing speed and frame rate. Even with their updates, lowering your graphics, lowering your resolution, turning off v-sync, turning on frame skipping, setting Trails Fusion to high priority and PC settings to performance, you will only marginally improve it. This game should be removed from Steam for quality control, they sold you a completely broken game that they don't even try to fix, or make good on. Absolutely shameful display of flippant disregard for the PC customers who shelled out the money and can't even make use of it as a paperweight. DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. FOR. PC.			"

			Trials Fusion is the latest installment in the Trials franchise from Red Lynx & Ubisoft ... A motorbike platforming game that becomes quickly addictive and almost insanely frustrating at the higher...		

Trials Fusion is a worthy addition to the team ... even though the futuristic backdrop feels a little bit against the grain of the series ... there was something special about the redneck vibe that previous games had ... but the graphics and the new types of bikes are pretty damn amazing ...The game follows pretty much the same path as the others ... the easy tracks are really easy ... the hard tracks are really hard ... and I am yet to manage to finish an extreme track ... The addition of the FMX tracks is pretty damn cool as well ... I have found lots of amazing tracks on Track Central - but also some terrible ones ... and this is the way with user created content ... but I don't see myself getting bored of this game any time soon ...Really looking forward to online multiplayer when it finially arrives ...Worth getting ... and looking forward to the season pass DLC content too!Slosh			"

												Synopsis: The 4th release of the 2.5D motorcross racing game with platform elements, where you shoot the best possible time with the least amount of faults/errors.Genre: Platform RacerYea! Great 2.5D graphics, pick up and play for 5 minutes style, high skill ceiling, support for player created content built in at launch, lots of ways to customize your rider and bike. Very competitive leaderboard game.Meh! Expierienced Trials veteran will find the game very easy to beat up til the Hard/Extreme tracks, skill games are now have to be unlocked and not accessible from own section, less skill games then previous games(probaly will be added via DLC). No launch SLI/Xfire support that causes performance issues.Bleh! Uses UPLAY,some game sections take forever to load, can be very frustrating to some people that could cause rage quits. Seems to be less tracks then previous games but I could be wrongLowdown: If you have a few friends to play with you will have a blast competing against each other's times, which is where all the appeal is. The game also can be quite rewarding as nothing is as awesome as beating a section of the track that you had been stuck on for 100 faults.4/5			"

												Minimum graphics card is a 5850?  Very Poorly optimized considering the game runs on the Xbox360( albeit terribly from what I have read).  Also the game is incomplete with promises to be finished in the future.  Ever bought a car that wasn't quite done based on promises that they will finish it later?Red Lynx should take a step back and look at this and decide if selling out to Ubisoft was worth it.			"

A CONTROLLER IS RECOMMENDED, BUT NOT REQUIRED!If you've played these games before, skip this section:The Trials series is a physics based ""platformer"" racing title where you can race against friends and have the results be a fraction of a second off. The game can get pretty difficult and the map makers can turn the game into something entirely different. The games require uPlay as a second DRM, but if you just want one DRM, you can buy it from uPlay directly (and might save money doing so, as Ubisoft wants their uPlay service to grow bigger.) You'd like this game if you are into racing and competiting, though you might still love it if you hate typical racing games.For a comparison to Trials Evolution, the last Trials game:Pros:- Track editor is miles ahead of the older editor, meaning cooler content if you don't like to edit your own tracks.- You can do cool stuns in midair, used in a nice points-based ""race.""- Can customize your biker and your vehicle, including the new ATV.- Challenges to complete on every map with very unique challenges on certain maps.- Hidden secrets on some maps.- SQUIRRELS!Cons:- What is optimization? Where did you take my frames? Why did you steal them?- The opening theme will get annoyingly stuck in your head if you don't move past it fast... WE'LL GO TO THE FUTURE! MAN! MACHINE! THE FUSION! ...WELCOME TO THE FUTURE! *Repeat 100 times*- Currently only local multiplayer, but there are ghosts of friends to race against (Online MP will be patched in later.)- Unyielding (beat track without tilting; use only gas and brake and never crashing) and Full Throttle (Never let go of gas and never fault) challenges can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves... Might be a pro if you're a masochist. "

												Trials Fusion has quietly become something of a minor masterpiece. With the normal content plus season pass and MAX DLC there are a pile of things to do in the game, and it should keep any player busy for at least a solid 40 hours. We haven't even touched the 20k plus community tracks. From the active online through to campaign and whatever else you need, there really isn't any way you could go wrong with the MAX edition, which includes all the DLC plus the new MAX stuff for 40 bucks. This will obviously drop in price on certain sales. I honestly have very few complaints at this point in time. So let's discuss a few things:A lot of the cranky reviews cite either Uplay or the newest DLC, released long after a the yearly season pass, as problems that make them feel angry and mad. Neither of these issues is even the slightest bit of a problem anymore. If Uplay is not running correctly for you in 2015 it's your own fault. I have absolutely zero problems with it and haven't had any major problems with it for well over a year. It's a solid service, if unneeded, and really it doesn't belong in reviews for this game anymore.The season pass has expired. It was never meant to be a free DLC for life kind of thing. Only an idiot would keep thinking that a season pass somehow connotates free DLC for life. The new content is suitably priced anyway. Taken as a whole there are literally no problems with this game. At its release I could definitely agree it was a little lighter on content and the price was too expensive for not having a functional multiplayer; as well it was buggy and unfinished. But that simply is not the case anymore. Everything you would ever need is now included in the game, but polished to a high degree.The unlocks are decent and the various bike upgrades and ability to change colors and wheels among other things is a nice feature to keep you busy. There are a decent amount of extras for those interested that kind of stuff. You can use acorns, the new currency, to buy special additions like new body styles, outfits, and faces. You also unlock a decent amount of stuff just from normal playtime with the original currency. Acorns currency can now be purchased for cash if choose to do so. Leveling up in game seems to grant a decent amount of acorns as well.The meat of the game I am very happy to say is very solid. Graphics have been given a large boost and it shows throughout the incredibly varied environments. With the season pass you have access to a multitude of different locales and each has its own vibe that is fairly unique. As far as comparing this to Evolution Gold well this one is a lot different. Fusion is more extreme, with the themes of the environments and tracks taking on a totally appreciated craziness that really never lets you down. Both games are worth owning.Evolution is more grounded, where as this one just goes for glory and throws in some very imaginitive and well-constructed tracks that take you from the fiery pits of hell to the most futuristic skyscrapers of an advanced civilization. And everything in between. There is no game that does racing quite like the Trials series, and the devs have seriously stepped up their game.There are the usual medals to earn, but there is also three achievements on each stage that can find you hunting down squirrels or activating secret switches for special achievements. These will keep a lot of people busy that have gotten their golds the first couple times through.Besides getting gold medals, the idea is that you may want to try and compete on the leaderboards. Cracking a top 5K time will definitely give you the challenge you need and should entertain the skill levels of all players. Add in some wonderful multplayer action and dozens of hours will pass before you get tired of this one.I run this in 4K with a single 970 on the highest settings and it mostly holds a stable 60FPS. A few drops here and there on certain courses. It's a beauty of a game for sure. It might have some nitpicks here and there, but for the most part no Trials game has ever looked even close to this lovely.All in all this is now a great game. Support for Fusion continues and multiplayer is still very active. So get on it. It's worth every penny.			"

This game is beast, looks gorgeous, runs smooth with everything maxed out on my 280+. U can switch between mouse, keyboard and controller without hickups, check your email while the game runs in the background and pops right back up when u give the command. It`s all good. Sure, I`m more of a purist and don`t care too much for the futuristic look but the core game is there and it is fun.

												this game is capable of rendering a good 60fps on a mid-range gfx card with all visual settings on maximum.but many people complain of poor performance.for whatever reason, this game insists on launching in borderless windowed mode. regardless of your previous settings, this game always launches in borderless windowed mode.while running the game in borderless windowed mode, you will notice that the game loses vsync capability and it appears to revert to 30fps for unknown reasons.so, for most folks, the cure for poor performance in this game should be as simple as this:at any point after you launch the game go to your keyboard, hold the alt key and press the enter key and the game will go into fullscreen mode and your framerate issues should disappear instantly on any mid-range gpu.

												I have played every other Trials game and I was very quickly dissapointed with this game.  Let's first start with optimization.    This game must have a perfect 60fps to run, because if it drops at all, even to 50fps it slows down so much that it is completely unplayable.  I have to set this game to absolute minimun settings and even then I still get massive fps drops.  And my computer can max out Battlefield 3.  Next we have the addition of the trick system.  It is the most god awful thing you can ever attempt to use.  It does not do what you tell it to do and the rider will frequently get stuck in a position.  But apart from the huge gameplay issues, the game is still just not fun or challenging.  This game is so easy that I was able to beat almost every track first try with a gold medal.  The leaning is also very unresponsive in comparison to older games.  The older games were very fun, but they totally blew it with this one.  Complete waste of $20.  Don't buy it.			"

But it is so choppy that it's unplayable.  I played with every single option, but to no evail. What now steam?  It's just a rip off at this point.  Had their been a demo, as there is with Trials Evo, I would have known.Just through away $20.  Lovely.			"

												I have been a long time fan of the Trials series, since the very first flash version on the PC, and have purchased the previous versions of the game on the xbox 360 as well as the PC.  I have to say, the whole DLC business has left me feeling sour, and I don't think I'll be buying future versions of this game.  I bought a season pass because I don't want to keep making microtransactions or buying additional content.  A bunch of mediocre extra tracks were released as DLC, and then suddenly I have to buy additional content?  Much like many other games nowadays it seems like the developers have gone from focusing on delivering a great game and instead focus on how much money they can bleed out of customers.  Also, with the latest updates, the game seems to run very badly now.  It used to run very well on my high specced gaming laptop, but now it fluctuates all over the place with the framerate speeding up and slowing down the game randomly as it pleases.  Get the previous trials games, but I cannot recommend this game, and I'll be avoiding any further releases due to the capitalist greed that's infected so many other games/developers/publishers.  Also, uPlay is the biggest pile of *%$^# ever.			"

Not spending another buck in this game, recommend that you avoid it too, this is everything that's wrong with the industry.Oh, and it has microtransactions too.			"

												After playing this game for just over 6 hours I can say that it is the most frustrating racing/bike game I have ever tried or played, it makes you so angry but at the same time makes you want to push to see if you can do that level with no faults or in a certain amount of time.  GG Redlynx and making me want to smash my computer but then not do it cause I MUST GET GOLD ON THIS TRACK. Plus, they finally have multiplayer, which would have been nice a long time ago cause you now you can't find anyone playing the game.			"

												Trials Fusion is an excellent entry to the series. Here's why:RedLynx tried something different this time around, and it works quite well. The trick system is an excellent feature put into the game. It promotes replayability of tracks by having the user see how ""flashy"" of a run they can nail and show off to their friends. It's based off of the famous RedLynx physics engine, making it intuitive, nice to look at, and at some points, silly to observe what may happen during a crash.But beyond the trick system, there's even more in terms of the traditional trials game. There's the usual spike in difficulty, where the last few groups of levels WILL test your patience, skill, and sanity. The levels themselves still keep their usual charm; being put in wacky/amazing environments, seeing things interact around you, it's all here. The environments all look great and there's enough variety to keep you happy.Now there are trick runs, where you have to see how many points you can get on a special track designated for this new system. I like this, because sometimes you want to do tricks on the normal tracks, but you know it may hurt your time. It seems they're trying to cater to those who like to have a little fun in between the serious time trials, and I respect their approach to it. It works for them.Skill games are back, and they're as fun and silly as ever. I don't agree how they made them a requirement this time around, but it's not the biggest issue in the worldEach of the bikes actually has a specific purpose and will be used depending on which track you're participating in. This is WONDERFUL. I remember in evolution you would use one or two bikes, because the only things the new ones did was have more power. I REALLY appreciate RedLynx making each bike unique and useable. There's some really nice biker customization as well. Lots of cool, future-y outfits to choose from. I'm really excited excited to see where the DLC takes this game. Although the game had a less-than-stellar launch, I'm still very happy with this product, and cannot wait to play through more trials. It feels like a trials game through-and-through to me, and that's what matters. It's a quality product that will only get better with more tweaking and additional content. I believe this is completely worth your money if you are a fan of the series.			"

												As other people have described, Uplay is the pubic hair in this otherwise fantastic entree. No experience with the previous Trials games is necessary to instantly (well, after dealing with Uplay) enjoy this game. Unlike traditional racing games, there is no steering. You control only acceleration, braking, and leaning on your supercharged motorcross bike, in an attempt to finish insane levels or interesting challenges. Before you know it, you'll be mashing the convenient ""instantly restart level"" or ""instantly restart at checkpoint"" buttons as you try to figure out how to get just a little more air off that one jump, how to avoid faceplanting on that log, or how to keep up with your friend's ghosts. It is easy to get caught up in the search for perfection on each level because the gameplay is so tight, fun, and rewarding. Highly recommend! WELCOME TO THE FUUTURE "

Posted: July 2, 2015
												So, after reading alot of reviews of the Trials series and this game in particular, i feel obligated to write one on my own.Many people had a huge problem with Ubisoft and their way to market their games, in fact those people hate on Trials Fusion just because it uses Uplay. The game is published by Ubisoft, i do not know why you would think they wouldnt put it on their own PC distribution service and account control service. Yes Uplay is sometimes broken, but those times are not THAT often, it happens  here and there, and Ubisoft doesnt seem to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ But really, i dont want to review the Publisher or the Developers, which both chose to run this game on the platform.The Game Itself:- a very skillbased ""racing"" game, where the point is more or less to drive through a track with no mistakes, only after that the time really matters- has alot of content (though the price with the DLC is pretty high, compared to a triple a title it matches though)-> User created content pushes the game forward to a pretty high replay value (which mostly explains my playtime)Most negative aspects about it:- lack of content of the original game (no dlcs) compared to evolution- no ways of communication directly through the game- the multiplayer is pretty lagged out (though it is much better than evolution)Overall, they needed too long for the game to be at this state (which is a pretty definitve version on how a trials game needs to feel like), it felt like a beta for about a year into it. The developers did not abandon the game though and continued to give (free) content for the players to enjoy. With this in mind, i can only say it is one of my most beloved games today, for its high skillcap and active community, which still produces some great quality tracks. "

Where every twitch of your finger could mean the difference between winning or constantly restarting from the last checkpoint, and it will happen... A LOT.

												Honestly, this games has a lot of good things about it, the graphics are a huge improvement over its predecessor and the physics seem a lot more accurate. I could sing its praises all day. However, there are a few things which pull it down. Generally I would say the soundtrack of fusion is a lot worse than that of evolution. it has it's positives but it really couldn't get me as psyched as evolutions. Also, it feels easier. The falls are softer and the bikes are easier to handle. Some would say that's a good thing but i really don't think it is. trials is like dark souls, a game to tear your hair out at. Whereas this I breezed through until the extreme levels. Overall I'd really recommend this game, but maybe not for £16. Under a tenner would be an amazing price however.			"

												Love me some Trials, have been playing the games for a long long time. This game is fun, but uPlay crashes my computer (even after a format, then Googled to see that it is common and has been for a long time) and I picked up the Season Pass, which doesn't net me all the DLC. So fun game, but the value isn't there with all the problems and shady marketing.			"

GAME! #1 My game refuses to go into full screen mode even after trying multiple different things that usually work: restarting my computer, re downloading the game, and trying to just launch it off of uplay. #2 The game randomly caps out at 30 fps until I fault or restart on a track, even when i have it set to 60 fps. #3 The game randomly pauses and cuts out audio for 10 seconds or so.

												This game had good potential, but ubisoft ruined it. I loved trials evolution and was anticipating this game because of it. At release I was very disappointed to find out there was NO online multiplayer. It took ubisoft around a month to finally listen to the community and release the multiplayer.In evlolution the custom maps were a blast making the game last forever, but in this one any DLC prop/part in a cusotme track requires you to have that DLC. So basically you need the season pass to play very many custom tracks. After paying for DLC which should never be in any game ever becuse paying for the rest of the game after you already bought it is bullsh*t. Ubisoft decided to release more DLC that ISN'T COVERED BY THE SEASON PASS. That is infuriating especially when they put in, in game transactions. After paying 20 for the game and 20 for the season pass which is reciculous becausericiculous because it is the same price as the game, and 10 for the other DLC that isn't included in the SEASON PASS. Now they want you to pay real money for fake money in the game that should be earned. In game transactions shouldn't be in any game that you have already dropped 20 dollars on plus 30 for the rest of the game. This is a new low ubisoft.			"

												MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD My NAT type is strict and did everything possible to fix it. Nothing worked. Even the port forwarding pointed out by Ubisoft. Also I was able to find 3 matches out of 10, and it takes about 2mins for the search to end. All matches included the same 2 players everytime (i guess big fans who keep playing anyway.The singleplayer is good IF you include the season pass, otherwise the fun will end shortly. And the fact that  you have nobody to compete with is a shame.Overall bummer. I think they waited too long with the multiplayer so nobody came back for it.:(			"

												I've been a fan of the Trials series for a few years now, but I always run into the same problem. I literary fly through all the easy and medium levels, but when I start the hard ones, the game's just over for me. I have to spend hours to get one done, and have use too many checkpoints. Easy and medium levels I get done in one go most of the times, all gold medals, but the leap to hard is just too much for me.That being said, the game looks amazing and the futuristic style is wonderful.The addition of the tricks didn't feel all that great to me. I like the idea of it, but the excecution can be worked on. Or maybe it's my controller, I don't know.Adding the skill levels at the end of every chapter was new to me, too, and fun! But a lot of times it's hard to understand what they want you to do or the learning curve is to steap. I had a hard time getting trough the one where you had to do tricks before you hit the ground. My rider was flying around like a rag doll, getting stuck on every part of the bike.The ATV's look great, but don't use them online! They're horrible to jump with. It's just the raw power you use them  for.			"

												Do yourself a favour and Ignore all the negative reviews on this game and all the whinging on its Uplay integration (which makes no difference at all). There is no such thing as a bad Trials game! It works fine online AND offline, the classic core gameplay is unchanged, there are a few new additions of course such as the FMX stunt courses and the futuristic theme which I see no problem with.All its a solid title and a successful sequal to Evolution Gold not to be ignored. (just make sure you turn off the in-game music/commentators at the start, they get a little irritating...) Also If you can afford to get the season pass as well then I recommend you do so, the more content the better!			"

												Although the physics and controls in Trials Fusion remain as good as they are in in previous titles; the whole game feels uninspired and unimaginative when compared to trials evolution. Sure FMX is now a thing and some may like that, but the entire theme of the game is future and nothing but future So after 60 or so tracks they all start to blur into one big yet slightly different track. I'd be fine with this if the tracks flowed nicely but they just aren't fun or challenging. Except the ninja tracks maybe but they verge closer to irritating rather than of more finely tuned Inferno III of days past. Perhaps if you're new to the series this game would be excellent, but after many hundreds of hours on Evolution I couldnt say the same.Tl;dr The game feels rushed. Pushed out quickly to make money without forsight into what made the last two games fun. Buy Trials evolution gold edition. A game made before Ubisoft fully dug their claws into Redlynx. Never go full Ubisoft.			"

												I approve of this game.The visuals are good, the gameplay feels grippy and responsive and is quite easy for even new players to get into.The music and sound in this game is well done, creative narrating voice that follows you along the many tracks of the game.The only downside of this is that there is no online multiplayer yet, but it will come eventually so until then I would recommend this game to anyone who loves to show off their skill or who love to see their biker slam their head against several concrete walls!

												Initial opinion, upon opening the game it failed multiple times to connect to ubisoft while my connection was fine.  After it made it into the game it immediately took me to where i can purchase more DLC when I was starting it for the first time to play it.  Maybe i'm  tired of all the games pushing DLC but there's something real annoying about a game that opens for the first time not with a cool intro movie or walk through but straight to the store page to sell you more.  I'll add more as i continue to play the game but controls seem to respond poorly.			"

												This was a great franchise that got absolutely destroyed by Ubisoft and Uplay.  Honestly, still a great game to pick up if you just want to play single player or custom tracks alone.  Multiplayer, however, is non-existant on PC.  There's just simply no one on, because they rushed it out the door without MP and didn't add it for a year, and by that time the game was dead already.  They made sure they rushed out those DLC's, though.  Also, don't buy the DLC.  You get infinite content through the community hub.I played and bought all the DLC's from all the previous Trials games, but supporting Ubisoft's destruction of a beloved franchise just isn't good.

It was still in or just out of beta when i first wrote the review and it wasn't as optimized as it is now runs a lot better. I think it was pretty cheesy of them to release a season pass.. that was for first 6 dlc within first year then they released the awesome max content for sale seperately but.. it is what it is.. I caught the wording when I bought the deluxe edition.. the part about the season pass being for first year or however they worded it so I knew they had the chance to release more dlc seperate than the deluxe edition.

												I love Trials games. My first was Trials 2: Second Edition back in like 2008. I got the demo, played the crap out of it, and bought the game. Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and bought it as soon as it did. This game was AMAZING. The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. Once I had all of them cleared, I saw on Facebook that Trials Fusion was in the works, and excitedly waited for it's release. After pre-ordering this game, and launching it the first time, I was immediately disappointed. The soundtrack is terrible (maybe not a big deal for you), loading took forever, and the bikes/rider/maps/tracks/menus all look really thrown together without much thought. My opinion, of course, but if you're going to get a Trials game, get Trials Evolution: Gold Edition. That game is the SH**.			"

												It always really bugs me when people low-ball the ratings for things because it didn't work for them. But in this case I think the technical issues are bad enough to be a non-starter. To clarify, the underlying game is a blast, from what I played, but to get 25 minutes of gameplay I had to put in about 3 hours of troubleshooting across two different (and very normal) computers, a PC and a laptop. There's a solid mix of server problems (uPlay AND another Ubisoft connection, both of which can, and for me did, fail often) which immediately reset your saved progress (it's always-online), graphics problems, and start up problems; all persistent across both computers. More irritating, the demo worked fine after a bit of work, and the full game did not: the demo uses uPlay but seems to save itself a lot of trouble by not attaching your progress to your account.I love the hell out of trials. But this game is hard enough to even start playing to make me wary of any future uPlay thing. It's more headache than the fun is worth.			"

The season pass needs to be seperately activated within uplay (another software/account for gaming) and does not include the last DLC they released (WTF IS A SEASON THEN?!?) and the local coop (the games selling point imho) is worse than the previous titles (less tracks,less player made tracks). i strongly recommend to NOT buy this!!!

												Welcome to the future! I have not played earlier trials games so I can't compare them to this game but overall I'm not a huge fan. I was led to this game by the app trials fronteir. I did enjoy the app but for anyone who thinks this game is like the app it is not. I was hoping to be able to upgrade the individual bikes a little more but you just get the bike. The only thing you can change is the way the bike looks, but not the actual traction of wheels or engine or anything else. And there are only a few bikes to choose from. It's a fun game to play every now and then but I can't see myself committing more than 30 minutes at a time to this game.			"

												The game by itself is amazing and the $/hour value is insane with all the content you get from used created content, but there's a slight flaw which is best explained with an example:1. Decide to play the game.2. uDontPlay update3. Launch game - unskippable logos, but that's okay they're short.4. Preload before the main menu. Okay, could've done that during splash screens, but okay.5. Connecting to Ubisoft servers.....6. Still connecting.7. Failed to connect to Ubisoft servers, hit retry,8. Finally connected to Ubisoft servers, yay.9. Browse around the menus checking for new stuff.10. Random freeze, Ctrl+Alt+Del => End task.11. Wait for uDontPlay to do some bs before it shuts down.12. Relaunch game, surprisingly uDontPlay hasn't been updated since then.13. Splash screen logos, preload, connecting to Ubisoft servers.14. Failed to connect to Ubisoft servers, hit retry.15. Go straight for playing this time, let's see the new content.16. Spend ~2minutes to complete the first medium map in the new pack, loving it!17. Autosave after the level completion takes about as much time as the level itself.18. Lost connection to the Ubisoft servers............. That explains it.19. Hit retry, twice this time, before it actually works.20. Back, back, back, back, quit game.That's ~15-20 minutes of Ubisoft bullcrap to play two minutes of an otherwise solid game.Guess I'll try again in a couple months.... but every time I try to pick this game back up it's the same reason that makes me shelve it and that's uDontPlay.I'll admit, the freeze could've been a bug from Redlynx's side, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ubisoft DRM is so well integrated that it is the reason why the menus are so slow to swap inbetween to begin with.Setting up Excitebike on a NES emulator from scratch would probably take less time than each fresh launch of Trials through uPlay after a prolongued absence.TL;DR Great game that's close to unplayable thanks to a U shaped anchor.

												I got this as part of the arcade pack a while ago, and kinda forgot about it.  Today I felt in the mood, having played some Trials HD back in the day.I start it up, and FIRST THING, it takes me to dlc.  It literally shows the menu where you'd pick levels, and automatically scrolls over to the paid content.  If I hadn't gone searching in disbelief, I could easily have been fooled into thinking that this game contains no career ""on-disc"", so to speak.Once i figured that out, I was puzzled that I'd gone and downloaded a free-to-play game without realizing.  It even has premium currency and expects you to buy outfits (which are also listed before the ones the game comes with).Everything about this screams money-grubbing, consumer-hating, can't-find-our-butts-with-both-hands-and-a-flashlight corporate stupidity.  I feel like I paid someone to spit in my face.Maybe the rest of the game is good, but I have no idea.  I'll never play it again.  There's a hell of a lot more game out there that actualy, you know, COME WITH THE GAME IN THEM.Ubi's gonna have to something pretty damn amazing to get me to install their pathetic U-play BS again.

												In my short time playing it so far, I had a really enjoyable experience.The visuals in the game are great, especially on high graphic settings. The game plays well with a keyboard, it feels fluid and nice. The tracks included with the game have awesome futuristic designs, and I'm sure there will be many amazing user created tracks soon. I've yet to try the editor but if it's anything like the one in Trials Evolution or even better, I can't wait to try it out.The game also has some cool music, the main menu soundtrack is sweet! "

												I'm a bit sad that I can't really reccommend this. I wanted more Trials, just to get rid of the shakes, but this.. This is most likely not the ""More Trials!"" you are looking for. Play Trials Evloution instead, if you have not done so and/or wait for the next one, where they hopefully tune some of the stuff back to ""functionaltiy over visuals"".Pros:- Graphics are amazing. Really, really pretty.- Still the same great Trials physics, bike handling feels almost exactly like the previous onesCons:- UPLAY-- This piece of garbage. BigPicture & COntroller -> Start any UPlay game -> Wait for Uplay updates & start looking for the mouse to click ""Start"". The day UPlay dies will be a happy one. Make a suicide pact with Origin please, why don't you. - Visuals over functionality-- Camera too often shows the scenery instead of the track you are about to land on-- Performance was never great with the Trials games, but because of the grat graphics and their camera work, Fusion performs HORRIBLE at times - which really sucks in a skill based ""pixel perfect"" thing, when you fail because of lag/hitches- ""Trick Mode"" is just bad. Right stick to perform stunts w/ the bike while in the air. Sounds nice, controlls horrbily. HORRIBLY.-- These levels are mandatory and mixed in with the normal Trials stuff and that sucks, because it just does not work wellI like trials more than I'd normaly publicly admit to, but this.. Yes, Trials should feel frustrating. But not because some Designer went ""Hey stop showing so much of the track, show the background, we spent a lot of money making this!"". They essentially broke their game with that attitude, about 50% of all levels I have played have had this. I am at about halway through, and between that and the Trick stuff, this is it for me, and I am actually a bit sad about this.. I want more real Trials.. :/Also, that intro Song.. O.oNext time, just make Trials Evloution 2, yes? Everyone will love you again and actually play your game..Thanks! :)			"

												I was really looking forward to playing Trials Fusion but in its current form the game is simply broken. The game speed is fixed to the frame rate which I assume is because it is a (rather bad) PS / XBox port. So if the framerate drops from 60 to 40 it runs at 2/3 of the correct speed. This means that a) you need a superb gaming system (forget about the minimum requirements) and b) all comparisons to other players or friends are complete bs. This is a reaction-based game, yet anyone can just crank up the graphics and play in slow motion, taking twice as long to position the rider. Apparently the developers are working on this but I recommend you stay away from the PC version until this is fixed.			"

												I know I havn't put much time into this game, but first impressions are key.It runs well on my PC and looks stunning, however... My friends are struggling to run the game without it seeming like its in slow-motion. Bad optimization? I'm not sure.The feel of the game isn't like Evolution, I found myself feeling 'floaty' weak and the handling between bike seems a bit samey, which If I can recall, In an interview 'we have put in a lot of time making the game better but still feel like trials'. It doesn't feel like Trials.The main reason I feel robbed is that there is NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!!! Only local. What the heck is with that?! Me and my friends all bought this expecting to race eachother and have a laugh like we used to.Please add online multiplayer and fix this optimization issue my friends and A LOT of other people are having. Seeing as we had to wait longer for it to come out on PC I was expecting much better for a £15.99 title. Wouldn't even pay a tenna for this how it stands as of now.Don't get me wrong, it looks lovely and level design is outstanding. Recommend if your looking for a single player experiance, running on a good PC and have no attatchment to previous Trials titles. But not many of us are those people.			"

												This should have been dlc for the last game. This game is way easier than the last and you never feel like you have to hold out on a level for a silver or gold because a)you always seem to have the medals to progress and b) you always seem to get silvers and golds anyway. Yes there is a connection between these two things but it just means that the game is not challenging enough. It wasn't until the ""hard"" levels that I really even felt like I had to do much at all with the controls. Sure, they give you ATVs and tricks but it doesn't mean much in the end. The ATV doesn't amke much of a difference gameplay-wise and the tricks are clumsily implementented.For players who haven't played Trials, go play Evolution Gold Edition or maybe the previous games (I don't know, only played Evolution). I'd pay $5-10 for this.			"

It is also working quite slow there and there so no recommendation this time. Don't lose your fans by making inferior game just to get some easy money.

												Having liked this genre of games in the past.. I really went in wanting to like this game. From the onset it looked like similar games, such as trial evolution, etc.. but much more massive in scale. Well, it is massive... that is for sure. It has tons of tracks, content, and multiplayer.. but along the way it lost it's fun, challenge, and excitement and ends up being a poor reproduction of a classic. Whereas in previous games, you could mess up and still not crash, or choose your path, etc.. this game is exteremly linear.. a do it this way or die pattern quickly emerges. That ruins all the fun and charm of the previous games. So after a few basic levels.. you start getting it.. and once you realize it is.. ok.. do this now.. then do this. ok now this.. it becomes boring and bland. Save your money and pick up trials evolution or one of the other ones.. as this one, try as it might, is actually the worst of the lot.			"

Choosing bike for just for it's shape.. huh.There is no stats for Bike Upgrades.. Spending money for just for shape.. nonsense..Side missions / Track Challenges have no explanations.. No place to track them..uPlay stil can't track the games..It's like a investment for future of the game.. Maybe It's gonna be better in next 5 months..If you wanna have fun, try Trials Frontier on iPad.			"

												Trials Evolution is way better IMO. Fusion feels overly gimicky and even on lowest gfx settings brings my 550 TI to its knees. Mostly because of all the stupid background crap that you can't watch anyway because you're focused on the track so... yeah, thanks for demanding that I upgrade for no real reason.			"

												The game has a really good and fun way of playing and riding a motor bike, which makes the gameplay very good.The levels get very hard, most gamers won't be able to finish the entire single player campaign. I don't know if I find this very fun or not, because it's good to have a challenging game but this makes it a rage game, which I don't really like. Of course you could always just not finish the single player and move on to the custom maps but most of those are very hard aswell, so you are ♥♥♥♥ed either way.But the real problem for me, and the reason why I don't recommend it is, the local multiplayer supercross.In the prequel (trials evo) you had 10 or so standard supercross tracks and you could download a bunch of custom ones.In this game, you also have 10 or so standard supercross tracks but you can't download any custom supercross maps.This makes the supercross very lame very fast and is the reason why I won't buy another trials game if they don't implement it anymore.TLDR:If you like a challenge and you liked the old trials evo's singleplayer maps you will really like this game.But if you want to play with your friends, don't buy it and stay with evo.

I feel like an idiot staring at the tiny screen that the game runs on and it doesnt help that the rest of the game wont run at normal speed unless it looks like pong and trials HD had gay sex in a back alley.

												It's a good game, but it's not as good as Trials Evolution. That game was very long and offered so much deversity in the modes and level design. Add the crazy amount of unique user created levels, multiplayer and you have a classic.Cons - Fusion is a pretty short game and the heavy handed futuristic theme is off putting after a while. If I have to hear that, welcome to future song one more time, ugh! The DLC has been pretty nice but they're short levels and not worth the price. The selection of user created levels is limited and not very interesting so far. No online multiplayer and the local multiplayer is a shallow experience. The later levels get ridiculously hard.Pros - It's still a Trials game and the controls are awesome. The new trick feature done with the analog sticks is a welcomed addition. The soundtrack during the levels are pretty sweet. So I still have to recommend it if you're a Trials fan, but I'd wait till i goes down in price.			"

												(Please note that I am downvoting this as a sequel if you have played previous Trials games. If you have never played a trials game before then you won't understand why i think this one is a failure so go ahead and play it.)As a standalone game this would be amazing. I'm a big fan of the Trials series (go to hell Uplay and Ubisoft with it). However this one just doesn't stand up to the previus installments. It's clear ubisoft was trying to appeal to the ""new generation"" with all the techno bits and futuristic looking backdrops, which I guess is standard for Ubisoft nowadays isn't it? I really like the solid color art style in other games like portal or Mirror's Edge, but it feels kind of out of place her. That's nto to say it's completely out of place as it still works. but as a long time player I miss the gritty and harsh art style of old. Just my preference though.*Important* If you were hoping to find those unforgetably cool tracks like the one's from Evolution and HD then you will be disappointed. The tracks leave something to be desired and I breezed through all of them fairly easily. There's no Castle Crash or Gigatrack or Archipeligo. I rememebr most if nto all the tracks from Trials HD and Evolution by simply hearing the name but i couldn't even tell you the names of th first few tracks in Fusion. This is rather big for me as I really wanted the memory hook that previous tracks had given me. They give each difficulty a general ""Theme"" for example the second area you unlock is supposed to be in the city but I couldn't be less enthusiastic about the environments. They just seem copy and pasted together and I turned off the audio because I didn't find ""Cindy"" or that pother guy i couldn't bother to remember the name of.If this sounds like I'm calling Ubiusoft out on being the dirtbags they so desperately desire to be then you may be on to something there. But I still LIKE the game I'm just not in love with it like i was the previous ones, and if a sequal can't superceed it's predocessors then it's a failure as a sequel.But I am sure we will see more of Trials as Ubisoft has made it clear that there are no such things as standalone games anymore.Go to hell Ubisoft and takle your piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥excuse for a ""Client"" with youAlso i would be nice if steam had a spell check, I knwo that's lazy but I'm legally blind so proof reading is too much of a hassle			"

												I bought this game thinking ""wow it looks so fun and I can't wait to play it"". I bought the deluxe edition and started the game. or at least I tried to. It took me to the Uplay account login screen. I signed up for Uplay thinking I would be able to play the game after signing in. But no, I can't connect to a Uplay server. I thought, ""okay, i'll just play in offline mode"". But no, I have to launch it in online mode once before I can play in offline mode. So, I thought to myself. I just wasted 39.99 dollars on a game I can't even play. Until I can find a way to get Uplay working, i'm going to think to myself ""wow, I just wasted 39.99 dollars on a game that was going to be awesome but I can't play because Uplay can't connect to servers."" I would not recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have a working Uplay account.			"

												Don't waste your time with Fusion. If you're a very experienced Trials player, it can take less than 2 hours to reach the Trials Trophy. I personally don't like the futuristic setting or the soundtrack, but if you like the setting you may like the game. Trials Evolution and HD are worth your time, not this.			"

												WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.Bought this as it was cheap in trhe Summer Sale and I own and love the game on my PS4, big mistake. As if it wasn't awkward enough to try and run in the first place (thank you Ubisoft, I totally wanted UPlay), it then crashed every time I tried to progress beyond the start menu, and every 'fix' I found online didn't work. So after racking up a tidy 0.4 hours play time just on the main screen, I decided it just wasn't worth the hassle and requested a refund.			"

												Well I didn't expect much out of this game... but I got it simply because I can always wind down with long easy Trials levels.Reading the reviews of this game, I knew it wasn't much, so I don't regret buying the game. However, I cannot recommend buying this if you are looking for a good Trials game.It is buggy, some levels are unbearably laggy (bad optimization) and the ""skill games"" from the previous Trials game are baaaack! And even more annoying than ever! If you want to play with keyboard, don't bother trying to do anything with those games. Ubisoft themselves wrote that they were designed for pad. But, these games are so lame that I can't be bothered configuring my pad.The levels (when they aren't laggy) are bland. There is no challenge. I play this game when I want to wind down... It's good for that. But if you are looking for a Trials challenge, you won't find it here.Also, you need to pay much more to get the other half of this game (DLC) and there is no multiplayer.			"

												The game is extremely clunky and reminds me of how much I hate Trackmania. One of the biggest, yet simplest, turn-offs is that the lean sticks. Instead of a central position where you can lean back or forward from, you have to constantly fight the lean. Oh, you stuck that landing after leaning back? Here, try this super wheelie on the ramp 10 feet in front of you.The game looked so fun from the videos I've seen and so much promise from user-created tracks. Such a let-down.Edit: Out of 100 games, this is the first one I've considered getting a refund. It has taken me 8 years with Steam to now realize there's no refunds. One hell of a lesson, I guess.

												BUY EVOLUTION INSTEAD.For people deciding on which trials game to buy, BUY EVOLUTION. Trials evolution was better than this game in pretty much every way, once you've squeezed evolution dry for all of its content, you can buy this one and play it too.Good:+ This game has a bigger online community than trials evolution. Even so, its good to play through single player first, which is why I still recommend evolution over this.Bad:- Some of the music in this game is good, but trials evolution had much better and more memorable music. The title screen music for this game is nauseatingly bad. ""welcome to the future""- The grapics on this game are so boring compared to evolution. They went way over the top with the ""futuristic"" style. Everything is made of polished metal and strip lights, which gets very boring after a while. Trials evolution is grounded in reality which makes it look much nicer and it ages better.- Uplay- Uplay- Uplay...			"

												This series is just so sad. I have Trials HD wich i got when i bought my xbox 360, and it's one of the best games i've played, i have so many hours sunk in to that it's not even funny. Then Trials Evolution came out, and i was so happy... until i played it. And Trials Fusion is suffering from the same things that Trials Evolution was. They have gone so far from the Trials HD idea that they are just bad games now. It seems like they are more focused on racing instead of the ""trials"" part. It's not even close to have the feeling Trials HD had when getting over obstacles. Getting past obstacles in Trials HD was alot of the times skill based, but in the 2 followup games it seems that you just have to keep on trying until luck kicks in and pray to god that you are ready for it and you dont screw up.In alot of places there is no reason in how the bike behaves so you can't plan for it, just do it over and over again until you get lcuky and guess correctly how the bike is gonna behave.It's a sad sad story. Trials HD was soooo good and now the games just suck, they are not even fun to play anymore. I bought this in hope that it would be better than "" Trials Evolution"" and maybe it is, a little bit, but it's still a bad game and I officially give up hope that the ""Trials"" ever will be as good as they were in the beginning. And it is a crying shame really "

Dispicable i was hopeing for better from a MULTI MILLION DOLLAR CORPERATION ... But i guess i can come to expect less from Ubisoft  I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME unless you are fine with only local multiplayer with online only drm (Uplay) so no real offline capibilitys  and dont mind that this game is not much more than a skin mod and a new map for Evolution			"

Just. Frickin'. Do. The. Frickin'. Bunny. Frickin'. Hop. This game? Don't buy it. There's zero difficulty settings to help peoplelikeus (me) and the control mechanism is horrible. You'd think that, at some point, your rider might actually want to situate themselves in the middle of the bike, like how they start off. No. Once you've leaned either way, that's it. Which basically screws everything.Obviously I'm not very good ... but hey ... perhaps give some help to the notsogoods out there. I'm definitely going to cheat this game, because screw this game.There's absolutely no brakes, just forward and backwards. Now maybe that's how trials bikes are made ... but this is a game. I would screw on a bloody brake onto the damnable thing!There are people who don't need the hardest game in the world, it doesn't hurt to put options in for those people. Seriously. Someone that wants to take it hard (*cough*) can do that all they like.Also this thing never connects to uPlay after the first few times. I tested FARCRY 4 straight afterwards to be sure, and sure enough that worked.Seriously screw this game. Violently.Casual games should be casual ... this really isn't that.			"

												not as good as evolution, bike selection is terrible, tracks are boring. trick system im a load of bs and a waste of time. missing modes,  super annoying commentary gets old fast when it repeats the same comments everytime you restart the checkpoint, bikes and leaderboards either load or the dont at all. feels like half the content was removed just for a season pass. NO SUPERCROSS TRACKS IN EDITOR!  skip this garbage and stick to evolution			"

												The game was okay. The controls are terrible in my opinion and I am not a fan of the start of level tutorials. Shouldnt you go through the tutorials before you start the game? It seems as if having all the info would be helpful before you start playing.  For the price, I sort of feel like I was ripped off. I have definitley played better (Free) browser based games.			"

												After owning Trials Evolution Gold Edition and finding the challenges get way too difficult I reluctantly bought Trails Fusion and 6 DLC's and it is just as dissapointing as I thought it would be. You play the first few tracks and are amazed by the game and then the challenges become stupid and frustrating. Why make a game that is totally amazing in every aspect except playability. Then you delete your purchases as its not FUN! "

												I've been a fan of Trials for some time, and I poured at least a total week into Evolution. That being said, I plan on pouring another week into this fantastic follow-up. This game has everything Evolution had and 5 times more. The stunning graphics, engaging setting and plot, FMX, and even more features in the editor are just a few of the great new things about this game. The one huge downside is the necessity of Uplay. It's really just a pain in the butt. However, the rewards and stuff along with the Trial Frontier connection kind of make up for the inconvenience. Seriously a 10/10.			"

												The veiws of this game are breathtaking, the controls are smooth and the tricks you can pull off are endless, however, recently I have found some very gamebreaking bugs, and a very slow frame rate if you have V - Sync enabled, and if you don't, then you get extreme tear on your screen! I do however love the trials series and the, now new community fanbase, are making extroadinary levels with the new level editor feature, which is one of the reasons I paid dearly for the Deluxe Edition, it is a bit complicated, but RedLynx have put up tutorial videos on their youtube channel explaining the level editor, if you are interested in creating your own levels.I bought this game thinking that it was a complete game, but dear me, as I mentioned before, there are A FEW game breaking bugs and slow performances, so if you do want to pay the full price for this game, at least consider that it still needs a little bit more development in it, and may be just in-between an Beta and a Release state!

												If you're a fan of motorcycle racing or motorcycles in general, you should love this game.  It's sort of like a 2D Platforming Motorcycle game in a 3D environment (Somewhat like Excitebike the arcade classic, except that's a 2d environment and this is a lot mroe challenging in later tracks).  This is also a very funny game with hidden easter eggs and track challenges that can make you laugh (like chasing a penguin through a track).  This game also has cool techno-like music that I personally love.  If you aren't a fan of riding tracks but you like creating tracks/levels, this game also has a track editor included in it!  I definately reccomend this game to racing/motorcycle fans alike.			"

												If you loved the previous Trials games, then definitely pick this up. Absolutely amazing physics-based, controller-smashing fun that we all know and love. Combine that with an even more expansive track editor than the last game, and you have a recipe for hours of entertainment.If you're new to the series, however, I would recommend you check out Trials Evolution first, as even though the graphics are a bit worse, the variety in the campaign maps is much more interesting. No matter which one you pick, though, you won't be disappointed.			"

												__________________________8/10____________________________            Trials Fusion is a great game.  Lots of fun to be had for anyone looking for a bit of a challenge.  Overall, i cannot complain much about the game for the way it runs.  The graphics aren't super next-gen amazing-ness, but they still are pretty, and in my opinion as good as it needs to be for this style game.  I've had one crash, and I'm not convinced it was the game's fault.         As compared to the last few Trials games, it still features great challenges and a darned good selection of community maps, which gives this game near infinite playability if you enjoy how the mechanics work.  Trials has always been about challenges an lunacy to me, and while Fusion may not feature as much as the lunacy as the previous games, the challenges are abundant and ready for you to make a controller shaped dent in something near you.  When i speak of this lunacy being missing, in the last trials game i was always happy with how the maps, and events always caught you off gaurd, and said ""Hey, so what if there's a war going on and a nuclear shark just tried to shoot you with laser beams, ride your bike fast ad hard!!!"".  Personally, fusion lacked this kick-in-the-groin lunacy i loved so much from the previous games.        Overall, Trials Fusion will offer you hours of challenging fun, but at times, may take itself a little too seriously as compared to the previous installations to the franchise. "

												Could ahve been as fun as HD and Evolution, ala Ubisoft mingled in some of their fairy dust and I stopped playing after 1 week.Stunt Maps are part of the global leader boards , which means it's not about beating times only any more, usually have to wait around 30 seconds after each map to sublit your new scores , because connections to uplay is always laggy. That is if your lucky and it didn't time out again. in this case you ahve to retry submitting your score if you managed to get a better time.Multiplayer is local only, which means forget about all the fun you had with evolution playing supercross tracks, it doesn't exists in this game.Regardless of all the uplay crap the PC version is still a mess. Duel Screen support doesn;t work like in other games, the second screen always blacks out, so you can't do anything else while waiting for your scores to submit.Window mode would have been a solution if the game could keep up the frame rates. And that is with a 780ti. God forbid you have a less powerful GFX.If your interested in Trial games , stick with Evolution. If you want to reward Ubisoft for realeasing unfinished crap by Fusion.

												I preordered this game a while back now and moving from Trials Evolution to this was a treat. The all new mechanics such as the tricks and adding the challenges to the singleplayer was brilliant and gave the trials experience alot more than just gaining the gold medals. Singleplayer is brilliant and would reccomend playing the singleplayer to anyone that owned Trials evo as you wont be dissapointed, however if your looking for a multiplayer experience, you've come to the wrong place. Local multipler has been implemented (however playing local multiplayer on a PC can be difficult) but there is no online multiplayer which is extremely dissapointing as this was one of the most fun parts of Trials evo. Hopefully this will be implemented soon as i am really looking forward to it and have been for a while now.			"

The bikes don't feel as responsive and the camera angles can cause frustration at times in being unable to judge distance to ground and such when doing flips, etc.Might become fun in the later levels, I'll throw another few hours into it but at this stage not high on the recommendation list if you're a fan of the originals -- if this is your first Trials game, you may enjoy it.

												Honestly, Trials is such an amazing, well made game. Up to par graphics, runs well, tracks are really well made (both by Red Lynx and community), and it is kind of a step up from Trials Evolution. Even the DLC's and that ultra max pack update/DLC made this game pretty great.My only problem is effin Uplay. I recommend the game, and if somehow you get the Uplay gods to like you, then you're golden (unless you're like me and you do something to anger the gods, then Uplay breaks your game entirely).All in all, great game, but bad platform. It really should have been run through Steam and not have Uplay be its launcher.			"

I've had one crash, and I'm not convinced it was the game's fault.         As compared to the last few Trials games, it still features great challenges and a darned good selection of community maps, which gives this game near infinite playability if you enjoy how the mechanics work.  Trials has always been about challenges an lunacy to me, and while Fusion may not feature as much as the lunacy as the previous games, the challenges are abundant and ready for you to make a controller shaped dent in something near you.  When i speak of this lunacy being missing, in the last trials game i was always happy with how the maps, and events always caught you off gaurd, and said ""Hey, so what if there's a war going on and a nuclear shark just tried to shoot you with laser beams, ride your bike fast ad hard!!!"".  Personally, fusion lacked this kick-in-the-groin lunacy i loved so much from the previous games.        Overall, Trials Fusion will offer you hours of challenging fun, but at times, may take itself a little too seriously as compared to the previous installations to the franchise. "

												Great difficulty and nice futuristic theme. Nonetheless, the motorcycles do not feel very futuristic.+infuriating difficulty+different behavior of the motorcycles match different level layouts+deep control system with emphasis on leaning the right way and breaking or accelerating at the right time; much deeper than those browser games+local multiplayer, sadly way more simplistic and uninspired than the single player levels-uplay-sometimes it is not very clear whenever a jump is a success or not because jumping often needs a special sequence of leaning inputs in a short ammount of time-stunt/trick system controls a bit wobbly as sometimes inputs are not accepted because of fast spinning (does that count as realism?)-game gets harder with your controller having a big deadzone. I cannot recommend Logitech devices-annoying menu design as it takes away from the futuristic theme and tries to sell you DLC all the time-game throws you out of a level if you need to many retries, erasing your checkpoint progressAll in all i can recommend this game despite it being an Ubisoft game. It is really fun after you finally are ingame and out of the disgusting and irritating menu screen.Keep in mind that this is the darksouls of motorcycle games so prepare to die.			"

												Sure, the genre has been done before, but Trials Fusion amps it up and streamlines it for much more fun. I was skeptical to buy the game after seeing that it had mixed reviews, but after playing it, there was no doubt in my mind that I bought a great game. I'm looking forward to buying the DLC and playing some custom tracks as well after I complete the campaign.			"

Both are great games, I'm not a fan of Uplay., but for me, these games were worth jumping through hoops to play them. They have easy, medium and hard tracks and hard means hard, but they also have user created tracks, so there is plenty of tracks to play.

												I have owned this game for 2 years now and I have played it on and off. I have been waiting to write this review since the I purchased Trials Fusion. I have now put 103 hours into Trials Fusion and I can finally say I have 100% completed the career. The emotional roller coaster I experienced while playing this game is unfathomable. Anger, joy, sadness. etc. the list continues for more words than are in my vocabulary. I'm sure that by this point my blood pressure is that of a 87 year old chain smoker, yet I don't mind. The satisfaction from completing a level or even improving a previous record is such an enlightening feeling. The rage and hatred that was once there is replaced by an abundance of good emotions. You battle no one but yourself, it is all a battle of your own skill. It takes away from the competitive nature of so many games and brings you back to the basics of what a game should be, frustrating beyond belief but satisfying. Red Lynx has done an amazing job putting together Trials Fusion and I could not be happier with the game. 10/10 Buy this game!			"

												This is such a great game didn't know much about it until it was on offer on steam for £7.99 and it's brilliant. The graphics all on ultra with my 2x GTX960 graphics are ace. This game is a treat on 1 player but mutli player local is just as fun with the kids and it doesnt matter that they keep crashing and piling into the dirt as the race carries on. It's such a fun game and ideal if you have 30mins or so for a quick game of something. Wort the money, fun game and lots of difficult parts but you just keep getting back on your bike or quad or even a unicorn! TOP GAME!! A must buy!!!			"

												This game is difficult, has GREAT graphics, and is overall fun to play. It has great local coop and lots of content. Something that is SEVERELY lacking and BROKEN is the online multiplayer. Both players have to have port forwarded and done other such out-of-program programming to be able to play like this. For someone on a shared internet this is crushing. Also it seems that the online matchmaking ISN'T THERE. I queued for 12 hours straight and it didn't find me a match. If these issues are fixed and the game given dedicated servers to handle the multiplayer (and if they fix uplay to let you play the game in the first place during AAA releases) this game would be fantastic. As it is the singleplayer is good but the multiplayer is LACKING a big selling point of the game and a big part of the reason I bought it. I would recommend trials EVOLOUTION as being better.			"

												Summary: Trials Fusion is a platformer with a small twist, you're on a motorcycle. It makes the game very unique and very fun. There is a plot, but you don't need to pay attention to it to enjoy this game it just gives answers to some small questions, but if you do want to know the plot it is a very good one, it's just a tad hard to follow. The game takes place in the future which is not like any of the previous games which took place in the present, so it's an interesting change in setting.Cons:-This game is VERY difficult, not that it's a bad thing though just be prepared that once you get to the last area in this game you're gonna wanna put a bullet in your head.-The soundtrack, it's pretty ""meh"" the only song I really enjoyed is from the DLC, ""Fire in the Deep"" but sadly it's only used in that DLC to my knowledge...-The amount of DLC, it's almost comparable to some EA games which is kinda sad... come on Red Lynx... don't do dis-Requires you to play the mobile counter-part to get one costume set, of course this is just aesthetic but it still kinda annoys me that if I want a costume set I have to play their mobile games, this also leads to my next point...-MICRO-TRANSACTIONS, screw you Ubisoft... this game was fine with just regular in-game currency...Pros:-VERY ADDICTIVE, this game is fantastic and you'll constantly come back to it wanting to collect more challenges and medals... assuming you like a challenge.-A pretty interesting and dark story, without giving anything away the story in this is pretty surprising and defiantly adds a dark twist to the game... you can even find out more to the story through the mobile version of the game, ""Trials Frontier"".-Very good setting, compared to Trials Evolution this setting is way better in that it is much more colorful and lively.-Added more content than the last game, this game now includes tricks, a quad-bike, and actual characters unlike the last iteration.-With the exception of the first DLC, ""Riders of the Rustlands"" all of the DLC is fantastic and develops the story even more.Verdict: 8/10I think many of the negative reviews are too focused on comparing this game to the previous one and UPlay, which in all honesty, UPlay is not bad at all you just have to make an account and log in and you're set.If you like a challenging physics-based games I would strongly suggest you pick this up, it's defiantly worth it.

												This recommendation was a tough call. I ended up choosing no for some very key things in the game that just made it painful to play. But first the pros.>Good theme, like, they couldn't have done it better. The blend between nature and technology was blended perfectly and it does feel like it is part of a bigger universe.>Nice controls (more on that).>Frankly great graphics (again, more on that later).>Good menus.And now the cons. In the cons I will not be discussing Uplay. The DRM does cost you a few minutes in the beginning and (for other games) can be a huge pain. However, in this game, all you need to do is log in once when you first boot it up and it doesn't really bug you much after that.So, cons>For someone with a lower-end machine, this game will kill you. As I said, great graphics, but what it did to me was reduce the framerate down to almost nothing and made the game almost unplayable due to button lag. My pc isn't terrible, either. It can play almost all games above 60fps and only goes this low for games like Next Car Game (which is an excellent game), and even for that it still gets 15-20fps.>Multiplayer is a pain, unlike the previous ones where it was a huge part of the experience.>Lack of content, which other people have commented on.>""Season pass,"" which is required to add what content the game should have had in the begining. Plus DLC, which I am generally against unless it's something like the gods and kings expansion pack. Basically, its just Ubisoft being Ubisoft.And thats pretty much it. If you are someone who has seen trials videos and wants to get in on it, pick Trials Evolution Gold Edition. It is better in most ways and equal when it isn't. If you have been a fan of the trials series ever since it started, go on right ahead. The main con for me is circumstantial, so if you are really dedicated you can have fun with the game despite the other flaws.Edit: Forgot about the ""More on controls."" Basically the only thing that I was going to say on that was that the game implemented a trick system that really doesn't contribute to the game at all. A few challenges may use it but most of the time it just gets in the way, especially during the tutorial levels.			"

												So, let me start by saying why is uplay such a big deal? the game runs flawlessly on my computer. uplay hasnt failed me once, and neither has trials fusion. Npw, i know people feel as if this is a terrible game, but, i find it very amusing. i like the graphics, and i really like the courses. trials fusion is the successor to trials evolution, witch may people like far better. havin never played evolution (which i will buy the gold edition) i wouldnt really know. but i am not to crazy over the futuristic idea of it, but it definitely captures the core gameplay of the trials series. the gameplay is deceptively simple.you have to drive your bike down a sidescrolling track and balance yourself by shifting your riders weight left and right.the game is 2.5d meaning that you are on a 2d track, but the rendering is 3d. you can only go forwards and backwards, but trials has such an addicting nature that you keep playing. overall 9/10			"

												If you loved the previous Trials games, then definitely pick this up. Absolutely amazing physics-based, controller-smashing fun that we all know and love. Combine that with an even more expansive track editor than the last game, and you have a recipe for hours of entertainment.If you're new to the series, however, I would recommend you check out Trials Evolution first, as even though the graphics are a bit worse, the variety in the campaign maps is much more interesting. No matter which one you pick, though, you won't be disappointed.			"

												The veiws of this game are breathtaking, the controls are smooth and the tricks you can pull off are endless, however, recently I have found some very gamebreaking bugs, and a very slow frame rate if you have V - Sync enabled, and if you don't, then you get extreme tear on your screen! I do however love the trials series and the, now new community fanbase, are making extroadinary levels with the new level editor feature, which is one of the reasons I paid dearly for the Deluxe Edition, it is a bit complicated, but RedLynx have put up tutorial videos on their youtube channel explaining the level editor, if you are interested in creating your own levels.I bought this game thinking that it was a complete game, but dear me, as I mentioned before, there are A FEW game breaking bugs and slow performances, so if you do want to pay the full price for this game, at least consider that it still needs a little bit more development in it, and may be just in-between an Beta and a Release state!

												  Just like it's previous versions, Trials Fusion delivers challening and fun tracks that test you mentally, with satasfying results with each medal you get. For those who don't know, Trials is a game about clearing challenging tracks with Bikes as fast as possible with as few faults as possible. You gain medals and coin that go to getting you new cosmetic items for your bike and rider, and well as unlocking further tracks for you to play. In Fusion, you now no longer have to just do trials tracks, but also FMX, where you can combo tricks on your bike, building up score in the attempt to get a higher medal.  I have this game for both the Xbox 360 and Steam, and have already put quite a few hours into it. I am most definitely content with the game, and the future it holds. It runs smoothely (In windowed, I get some frame drops), without any issues when I have other programs up, and even though it has Uplay, I don't get any of the issues I have with Assassins Creed Black Flag.   I definitely recommend this game, and enjoy it far more than I did with the previous installments. 9/10			"

												It's early days yet having just installed and played the intro levels but I much preferred the 2D gameplay in the early Trials games and on my iPhone at this stage.  The bikes don't feel as responsive and the camera angles can cause frustration at times in being unable to judge distance to ground and such when doing flips, etc.Might become fun in the later levels, I'll throw another few hours into it but at this stage not high on the recommendation list if you're a fan of the originals -- if this is your first Trials game, you may enjoy it.

												This is the first Trials game I've played and I'm really enjoying it with the exception of two things.1: Lags all the time for no good reason. The internet's only solution is to decrease the resolution, but I'm at the minimum res and it's still doing it.2: Why isn't there a female rider? It's 2014, why can't I play as a girl in a motocross game? I could play as a girl in the freaking PS2's ATV Offroad Fury 2 and that came out in the early 2000s. There's literally no reason to not have a female body option.Game itself is gorgeous and fun and, provided the lag holds off or is somehow solvable, I'll be playing a lot of this.			"

												I want to start off with the good parts of this game. I played the previous Trials games on the console and I was hoping that I could continue the series on PC. To an extent, I did. The gameplay was as I remember, i.e., incredibly addicting and rewarding. If you were to compare stills of this game to the previous games, you could tell it looks incredibly better. But after I got past the introductory phase, I started realising how annoying logging into Uplay was. I also ran into frame rate problems. I'm not implying that I'm running a powerful system (my graphics card being a Radeon HD 7870), but compared to the smooth 60 fps I can maintain on medium settings in Metro: Last Light and Bioshock Infinity, I found the 40 fps and often 20 fps on low settings to be COMPLETELY absurd. I'm quite offended that the developers put less care to the PC version but I suppose it's my fault for assuming otherwise from Ubisoft. Although I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, I cannot recommend it to anyone without a more powerful system. The low fps is more than nauseating as usual but actually disruptive in the gameplay. Please play the demo, which I'm very grateful is provided, before thinking of purchasing it; something I was too anxious to do.			"

												If you like Trials for the multiplayer, this is easily the worst. After months of no custom multiplayer maps, now there are around 10-20 available to download, to add to the 12-odd which come with the game. In all, you can play them in an afternoon, if that. Aside from this, the game has no real improvements from Evolution. If you want Trials, get that instead. Cheaper and more maps, without being any different graphically.			"

												NOTE: This is a long, detailed review. Longness may occur past this point.I had never played a Trials game before, but was familiar with the series, so I bought Fusion before the Summer Sale ended. I figured I'd be playing it a lot over the summer and as a general timewaster, so I bought the Season Pass with it, for a total of $30.Honestly, I feel like I've wasted my money buying this game.Having never played any other Trials games, I have nothing to compare the gameplay of Fusion against. I do know that it has no online multiplayer, which is a major disappointment. Looking through other reviews, I can see that the game is apparently lacking in other places (lack of tracks, buggy trick system, etc.), but again, I have nothing to compare it against, so I can't verify these claims. In my 2 hours of playing, the core gameplay has been solid. However, it's been mostly unenjoyable, which brings me to my first major quip with this game:1. The game is horribly optimizedI started up my game to my rider rising up an elevator in the first tutorial level. It was going pretty slowly, maybe for dramatic effect. And then the slowness carried on through the level. and the next one after that. What was the problem behind this? It turns out Trials Fusion is hellbent on running at 60 FPS. If you can't run it at 60 FPS, the game merely slows itself down until every in-game second has 60 frames. The result? If you run it at 40 FPS, every 3 real-life seconds becomes 2 seconds in-game. 30 FPS? Your game runs at half-speed. 20 FPS? A minute-long tracks now takes 3 minutes to complete. Have you ever put an old game in your floppy disc drive of your computer and it runs at lightning speed because the game speed was tied to processor speed? Trials Fusion goes 15 years into the past to bring back this experience. And don't you worry, they thought of that one supercomputer that can run the game at 90 FPS, so the game caps at 60 FPS so it doesn't run away.All in all, after crippling the resolution, video settings, and everything else, the game ran at an average of 45 FPS for me, where it started off at 15. My GPU may not be the greatest in the world (AMD Radeon HD 7640G), but it gets the job done for every other game I've played at decently high settings. Trials Fusion at its lowest possible settings still brings my GPU to its knees.2. uPlay is a piece of crap and attempted to eat my computerA little backstory here. I bought Burnout Paradise during the 2013 Summer Sale. Upon launching, EA promted me to make on Origin account, which I did. They didn't bug me any further, and from then on, Burnout launched through Steam and my Origin log-in was confirmed after launching.So why is it that Trials Fusion requires you to install uPlay, and that launching Trials from Steam only launches uPlay? If I only had to make a uPlay account to play (like with Burnout!), it would be fine. But why do I need a second game-launcher just to accomplish the task of launching my game, Ubisoft? So launching Trials Fusion is clumsy and weird because it requires installing uPlay, which seems bad enough. For me, however, it was the start of my problems.A couple of days after installing TF, Flash videos stopped working, which required me to disable hardware acceleration to fix. Whatever, Flash is buggy anyway. And then weird black bars appeared near the top of the window when I was watching a Twitch stream. OK, maybe something is wrong here, so I'll run an antivirus scan. My computer crashed mid-scan, and then I got my first blue screen the next day. The day after that the most ominous thing of all happened. I was watching a video when it flipped to another screen that said, ""You can activate your operating system under the Settings tab."" I went back to the video, and minimized my screen to reveal that I could now see my OS and build in the lower-right hand corner of my desktop. At that point, I went to System Restore and got uPlay the hell out of my computer. It's been about a month since the restore, and to date, nothing nearly as spooky as the aforementioned things has happened again.SUMMARY/TL;DR:You may notice next to the thumbs-down that I have 2 hours logged playing this game. This is due to a combination of the problems mentioned above. In my short time playing Trials Fusion, the gameplay wasn't that good for me, because it didn't run at full-speed. I can imagine it would be a great game if the damn thing would run correctly and stop being so picky. Ubisoft has done a decent job patching their errors, adding things like ""better"" optimization and custom Supercross tracks. Until they fix the bigger things though, I can't say anything good about this game. In conclusion...-Only get this game if you're absolutely confident in your computer's specs, ESPECIALLY GPU-Don't expect online play anytime soon (because the poor slow-motion guy would be left behind...)-uPlay is a piece of crap-If your computer fights back after installing uPlay, you should listen to it-#4spooky-I like donuts :3			"

												You can lose numerous hours playing and hunting times in this great game! You will also rage but it isn’t like most games because of the game mechanics it’s because of your ability, but this makes you strive for a better time and keeps you coming back to Trials Fusion.All impressive maps design, graphics Easter Eggs (Squirrels) bikes and customization and also challenges have been done brilliantly. Also after you have completed the campaign to your ability you can get stuck into user created tracks which further makes the game playable.The new addition to Trials Fusion which include the new FMX trick system is great too!Only a few minor downsides for me.. The voice/screaming of character gets quite annoying after a while although you can turn it off and the extreme track Inferno IV. That damn map! And obviously the biggest downside is Uplay!One recommendation which i would give is that you should use a controller as it is easier to control your bike.In summary this is a great game which you can easily rage but get addicted to. Ubisoft needs to stop using UPlay for future titles.9/10			"

												Could ahve been as fun as HD and Evolution, ala Ubisoft mingled in some of their fairy dust and I stopped playing after 1 week.Stunt Maps are part of the global leader boards , which means it's not about beating times only any more, usually have to wait around 30 seconds after each map to sublit your new scores , because connections to uplay is always laggy. That is if your lucky and it didn't time out again. in this case you ahve to retry submitting your score if you managed to get a better time.Multiplayer is local only, which means forget about all the fun you had with evolution playing supercross tracks, it doesn't exists in this game.Regardless of all the uplay crap the PC version is still a mess. Duel Screen support doesn;t work like in other games, the second screen always blacks out, so you can't do anything else while waiting for your scores to submit.Window mode would have been a solution if the game could keep up the frame rates. And that is with a 780ti. God forbid you have a less powerful GFX.If your interested in Trial games , stick with Evolution. If you want to reward Ubisoft for realeasing unfinished crap by Fusion.

												So, let me start by saying why is uplay such a big deal? the game runs flawlessly on my computer. uplay hasnt failed me once, and neither has trials fusion. Npw, i know people feel as if this is a terrible game, but, i find it very amusing. i like the graphics, and i really like the courses. trials fusion is the successor to trials evolution, witch may people like far better. havin never played evolution (which i will buy the gold edition) i wouldnt really know. but i am not to crazy over the futuristic idea of it, but it definitely captures the core gameplay of the trials series. the gameplay is deceptively simple.you have to drive your bike down a sidescrolling track and balance yourself by shifting your riders weight left and right.the game is 2.5d meaning that you are on a 2d track, but the rendering is 3d. you can only go forwards and backwards, but trials has such an addicting nature that you keep playing. overall 9/10			"

												Having played every Trials game since 2, i've seen the series go from warehouses to the great outdoors and now to the future and with every iteration, it gets better and better. Trials Fusion pretty much kept what made Evolution great and added a few things to keep it from being just another Trials game. Here's my verdict.The GOOD.-""WELCOME TO THE FUTURE....MAN, MACHINE, THE FUTURE!""...yeah MUCH better intro than ""VROOM VROOM, im ready to go, time for the muh muh muh muh muh muhnday nitro!""-Trials and Tribulations: The easy to learn, hard to master gameplay is still here and still as good as its ever been.-HOLY EPIC PC PORT BATMAN!: Redlynx learned from their mistakes, a much better port than Evo was. No texture pop in, no long load times, no FPS studdering all while adding a lot of graphics options to cater to many different setups. Nothing but good, clean, beautiful visuals at 60fps.(up to 120 would've been great though)-Challenging: The new challenge system adds ALOT of replay value to each track, although after beating Inferno IV, i don't wanna ever do that again. But its nice to go back and do 15 backflips on a track or finding that secret entrance or play tennis with a penguin to get XP for that fancy body kit you want.Here's my Inferno IV results if you don't believe me: http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/3332972269309505928/43D7B8AAF0EA94C165A622603A4DBFCDEECC01C2/The MEH.-Tricky: The FMX system is nice...but finicky, i've used keyboard(my main setup) and a PS4 controller and no matter what i do, i can never get it to do the trick i want to do during FMX events(Especially the ones that ask you to do specific tricks), i can only do coffins...EVERY TIME! Frustrating at times but a neat little addition nonetheless.-From an easy stroll to a trip to hell: As a long time player, i've gained a bit of skill over the years. I can gold(and above) every track up to the Rainforest bit, with ease(minus challenges). But after that, man does it go from easy to hard in an instant, i feel like newcomers are gonna have more problems adjusting to the difficulty curve than i did. At first its all about high speed and looking cool, after the ATV section...its all about control and balance, ESPECIALLY after unlocking the Pit Viper.-Do i look pretty?: Customization options are here, but a bit lacking, you can't operate on individual bike parts anymore(in favor of body kits) the rider customization is Tiered and in different themes and you can only change out the helmet, the shirt and the legs. Which kinda sucks, but there's alot to unlock and each tier is better than the last.The BAAAAAD.-Aside from the FMX, there really isn't anything new.Conclusion: Its Trials, if you've never played one, do yourself a favor and pick this up, this is by far one of the best arcade series out there. If you're a fan and you needed more Trials, click that buy button.			"

												The Bad:- BEWARE, this uses DRM in the form of uPlay, and does not tell you this anywhere prior to purchasing despite what some have said; very, very misleading. - Having to sign into two separate accounts every time just to be able to play the game (Steam and uPlay).- uPlay achievements instead of Steam achievements, even though it was bought on Steam - again it tells you this nowhere prior to purchasing.- Game physics seem tempermental at times, especially compared to all previous games which were almost consistently correct e.g. your bike can clip into the world forcing you to crash every now and again, or random unexpected bounces or rotations that don't feel right.- Game feels slightly unfinished e.g. still no online capabilities, and bikes not loading at all in the bike selection screen.- A good few of the Individual track challenges are stupidly frustrating beyond belief.- Shorter tracks than previous games.- No custom resolutions.- Crosses the fine line between challenging and frustrating.The Good:- Significantly better visuals.- Customisation.- Individual Track Challenges.- Not a bad PC port.All in all the game is good and fun, albeit hair pullingly frustrating if you want to complete everything. A big problem is uPlay and the fact you're duped into using it or else you've wasted your money.			"

Just don't buy it. "

												Same old Trials, New Maps.  I fell in love with this series years ago on console, and for the most part this installment hasn't dissappointed me yet.  It's addictive. It's frustrating, but the feeling of satisfaction when you finally gold medal makes it worth the anger. The new FMX mode and 4-wheel drive vehicles add some slight variation to the old formula. The Community Track Creation has huge potential and some pretty good tracks have already been created, but sometimes the direction changes are clunky and completely throw off the feel of the tracks.If your framerate drops below 60 the game goes into slow motion mode, which can get really annoying, but with a decent pc and nothing running in the background that won't usually be a problem. Every other review has taken care of complaining about Uplay for me so I won't bother.  No Online MP, Local only (Something tells me we can expect to have to buy a ""Online Multiplayer DLC Pack"" in the near future).  ""Season Pass"" seems awful pricey (it costs as much as the base game) so the devs better be planning some massive DLC packs to justify that price, otherwise I'm passing on that for now.   The Commentator Audio gets VERY repetitive if you get stuck on a track.Overall, It's enjoyable with a few small flaws that can be easily looked past. If you liked any previous Trials games, or if it's on sale, you should definately buy it.			"

												Trials Fusion brings back the Trials series we all know and love from Trials Evolution and adds tricks into the mix of gameplay.That's right - no more just front and back flips....now you can superman or strike a pose etc...It's the typical Trials so if you have played the others then yer in for a awesome time....if you haven't played the others - just know it's basically the new version of Excitebike....so WIN!

												It's early days yet having just installed and played the intro levels but I much preferred the 2D gameplay in the early Trials games and on my iPhone at this stage.  The bikes don't feel as responsive and the camera angles can cause frustration at times in being unable to judge distance to ground and such when doing flips, etc.Might become fun in the later levels, I'll throw another few hours into it but at this stage not high on the recommendation list if you're a fan of the originals -- if this is your first Trials game, you may enjoy it.

												Trials Fusion is a great game for fans of previous Trials games and newcomers to the series. The tracks are challenging, the editor is powerful (if a bit hard to use), and the community is rapidly expanding. There are the occasional glitches (seed builds will crash your game without fail), but it harldy detracts from the overall experience (except for seed buildings NOT ♥♥♥♥ING WORKING). Overall I would recommend this game, but it does need some bug fixes (please fix seed buildings).			"

												Great Game and great gameplay!Alot of the levels are pretty easy to get a Gold medal on the first run, it only starts to get challenging as you reach the last 3 stages. The graghics and art style look really good for a $20 game. It runs smooth and keeps a good FPS. This game has lots of re-playablity due to User-made tracks, getting Platinum on all tracks and doing challenges. It could easily last over 20+ hours. Overall for $20 your getting an extremly well made game that would satisfy all your trials needs!			"

												7/10 - Honestly rather dissapointingThe length of the singleplayer is rather short weighing in at about 3 hours with little to no retries, obtaining mostly gold and silver medals. Their new FMX mechanic is unintuitive at best, boiling down to flailing the right joystick in hopes it counts as you performing a trick with little rhyme and reason. The game is relying on the user created tracks to increase its longevity, which is not a bad thing but expect to pay for their DLC to continue playing their community tracks as it will most likely be required.Pros:-Still the same great Trials game-User created maps-Very pretty visuals and effectsCons:-Expect semi-required DLC-FMX is unintuitive-Short singleplayer experience			"

												Just finished the 'story' after about 5 hours, but there I a ton left to do earning medals and perfecting the super challenging expert levels that unlocked. Fun & addicting, unfortunately that's offset right now by a few things like Uplay and online multiplayer that doesn't seem to work. I also had some major frame-rate issues in some of the maps. I don't have the most beefy PC but I was able to run 95% of the game on high settings except for a few levels. I tried dropping to ""low"" to see if things would improve on just those levels but no luck. Seems to just be a part of the game and with something that requires precision, it was frustrating when a jerky framerate would mess me up.Realisticaly the uplay integration isn't too annoying once you set it up, but why can't I get Steam achievements instead of uplay achievements (or at least both)? If you really dig this type of game I'd pick it up. But for the reasons above I couldn't recommend it at full-price right now. "

												Pros:This games is extremely fun.  The mechanics aer solid and it is overall, nice looking.  The soundstrack is also very good.  Also, the comunnity tracks provide endless, quaility gameplay.Cons:There are random frame drops during some stages.  In order to use the DLC, you also need to activate it in game, it doesnt automatically sync.  Also, to get some items unlocked, you need to play the mobile version.Final thoughts:Other than the Uplay involvement, this is a fun game.  Expect problems but I think the enjoyment outweighs the cons in this case.			"

												The overall game is really cool and the graphics are nice. But If you wanna buy the game for the community maps, then you need ALL the dlc's. I have the standard game without any dlc's, and i have to scroll through multiple pages of maps to find one i actually can play without dlc content, and there are thousands of maps, so i can only play about 1/4 of them.I am thumbing this game up because it is a really awesome game, but ONLY if you have the full package with all the dlc's. So dont buy the standard 20 euro version, buy the 60 euro version, which is the cost of any other AAA game...really?			"

												This game is great because it provides a great balance between fun and challenge. The game allows for continuing without getting a Gold or Silver medal, only a Bronze. So if a particular level gets to be too frustrating you can continue on to the next level and then revisit it.The flip side, though, is that once you finish a level and haven't received Gold you feel very compelled to retry, which is great for adding re-playability. I haven't played through completely yet, or any of the DLC but so far I'm enjoying it more than the previous Trials games which I liked as well.There are a few levels that are difficult, mostly because the challenges are unclear. That's about the only time you can blame the game for the frustration it induces. One level in particular is the most searched variant of Trials Fusion, Trials Fusion Big Air. I completed the level with Gold after looking up how others did it for some instructions, but I'm not convinced I could do it again.Odd levels aside I'd definitely recommend it.			"

												I feel like you have to know what Trials is before you play it. If you don't, you might be very surprised after playing it for a bit. The first set of levels are simple and enjoyable. The middle ones are pretty tough. The final tracks will frustrate the hell out of you. Some tracks are normal trials, then others are stunt tracks and mini games. Most of the tracks have 3 bonus challenges, so there are reasons to go back and revisit all of them. You can also try to beat your friends times (and scores I think) on each track.I haven't even downloaded any player created courses yet, but I know from playing Trials Evolution on Xbox 360 that people make some crazy stuff to play.I think most people can enjoy this game. The controls are simple, but challenging to perfect in the later levels. The game provides a great challenge for people, but casual players can enjoy it too.			"

												This game steadily increases in difficulty from thinking you should probably take up motorcross, to then wanting to go back to school for a physics degree. The pacing throughout the game is pretty well done which makes you want to keep playing, but I found the trick system to be somewhat lacking.			"

												If you loved the previous Trials games, then definitely pick this up. Absolutely amazing physics-based, controller-smashing fun that we all know and love. Combine that with an even more expansive track editor than the last game, and you have a recipe for hours of entertainment.If you're new to the series, however, I would recommend you check out Trials Evolution first, as even though the graphics are a bit worse, the variety in the campaign maps is much more interesting. No matter which one you pick, though, you won't be disappointed.			"

												It's a strange one. I played the previous game a loooooot, but this... it's not making me want to play it. It's .... sterile? It's just the same thing again, which isn't normally that bad but.... yeah, it's too similar. How much can you really do with a motorbike game? I think they needed to leave this for a longer time before coming back to the series. Let the heart grow fonder and then it'd have more impact.			"

												I know I've only logged an hour into this game, but as a very big fan of physics-based games, I have to say this one was a let down for me. I'm not going to complain about Uplay or say that the game isn't optimised correctly, because it plays wonderfully on my system at 60 FPS, ultra settings. There's really not much to Trials Fusion other than balancing your bike over different types of bumps, landing your bike correctly, and occasionally flying through the air to the next part of the track. Now don't get me wrong, there are neat tricks, solid physics, and a great presentation along with beautiful graphics. But even on sale like I got it, I'd say the $15-20 isn't worth it. Maybe at $5. If you want an awesome physics-based game where you do more than just grind through levels by shifting your weight on a bike to get over giant hills, etc., then I'd recommend you go play Happy Wheels. It's free, you can play it on flash, there is a far greater variety in vehicles/stages, and it's just more entertaining. I really love Ubisoft, but I have to say pass on this one.			"

												The veiws of this game are breathtaking, the controls are smooth and the tricks you can pull off are endless, however, recently I have found some very gamebreaking bugs, and a very slow frame rate if you have V - Sync enabled, and if you don't, then you get extreme tear on your screen! I do however love the trials series and the, now new community fanbase, are making extroadinary levels with the new level editor feature, which is one of the reasons I paid dearly for the Deluxe Edition, it is a bit complicated, but RedLynx have put up tutorial videos on their youtube channel explaining the level editor, if you are interested in creating your own levels.I bought this game thinking that it was a complete game, but dear me, as I mentioned before, there are A FEW game breaking bugs and slow performances, so if you do want to pay the full price for this game, at least consider that it still needs a little bit more development in it, and may be just in-between an Beta and a Release state!

The bikes don't feel as responsive and the camera angles can cause frustration at times in being unable to judge distance to ground and such when doing flips, etc.Might become fun in the later levels, I'll throw another few hours into it but at this stage not high on the recommendation list if you're a fan of the originals -- if this is your first Trials game, you may enjoy it.

												Probbaly a little less content than previous Trials with a higher price tag but Redlynx swore to support the game post launch with free content (and of course paid DLC), multiplayer is abcent at the moment but it's supposed to be patched in weeks from launch. The port itself is pretty well done, really sharp graphics and constant FPS. If you like the previous games you most likely will like this one. There are new addon features like stunts and stuff but they're mostly to ""show off"", they didn't really mess with gameplay which is a good formula.			"

												If you would like the game to be even halfway close to riding a real motorcycle you will be dissapointed. It does not take that much time to figure out that the people that wrote the program have never actually riden a motorcycle before in their life. Let alone ever been on a trials track. There is no just lean a little foward. But there is a lurch forward hard enough that you land on your face every time. There is no just tapping the brakes. But there is a total lock up of the front wheel wheel that is going to throw you on your face every time though. The rider has 3 postions, jerking back, learching forward, and riding in the middle with nothing else. I am dissapointed with how real this game is.    But if you want a game that is just a motorcycle game, this is for you. The tracks are a challange to say the least, but the visuals are great. The game looks fantastic. Just not very real.			"

												Like Tetrix, some game excels because of its simplicity. It is so true for the Trials series. The goal of the game is simple, to get your bike from point A to point B as fast as possible without crashing, and all the controls you have is accelerate, break, leaning forward and back. However, the game gets challenging very fast and you always want to try again just to chip a few millisecond or to manage that difficult jump.Compares to its predecessors, Fusion offer a cleaner, more futuristic setting. Some players will miss the more gritty setting of Trials Evolution. The game offers nicer lighting, some neat bloom effects, and nice post-processing effects. Overall the graphic is very beautiful and crashes are spectacular.The game add a few new twists like being able to pull tricks with your right thumbstick. I find it a shame they add this feature and yet removed the ability to share replays on Youtube. What is the point of pulling spectacular stunts yet unable to show off to others? Likewise, there is no longer online multiplayer, which is promised again and again by the developer but no ETA is in sight. Given there are already 2 DLCs released you can tell the developer is focusing their efforts on making money instead of finishing the multiplayer feature of the game. There is local multiplayer you can play with your buddy on the same sceen.You can also make your own tracks, and at the writing of this review there are already over two thousands user generated tracks online, and many of them are top quality and add to the longitivity of the game. Which is necessary because there are much fewer tracks than Trial Evolution Gold. Again, I feel the developers are holding off the initial release of tracks to sell them as future DLCs, which BTW at 4.99$ for 10 tracks is quite pricy.Gameplay wise the official tracks are well designed but most of them are shorter than TEG. I find there are some twicks to the physics and overall a bit more forgiving than TEG. You can also make 1 or 2 faults and still get Gold on some tracks which I like because it is less frustrating, but I can see hard-core player won't like the change.Overall, I'd still recommand the game just because the overall concept is awesome. However, I don't like the business practice of the developer and would recommand you to get the game when on sale, where you can get the main game and the season pass as one package within reasonable price.

												NOTE: This is a long, detailed review. Longness may occur past this point.I had never played a Trials game before, but was familiar with the series, so I bought Fusion before the Summer Sale ended. I figured I'd be playing it a lot over the summer and as a general timewaster, so I bought the Season Pass with it, for a total of $30.Honestly, I feel like I've wasted my money buying this game.Having never played any other Trials games, I have nothing to compare the gameplay of Fusion against. I do know that it has no online multiplayer, which is a major disappointment. Looking through other reviews, I can see that the game is apparently lacking in other places (lack of tracks, buggy trick system, etc.), but again, I have nothing to compare it against, so I can't verify these claims. In my 2 hours of playing, the core gameplay has been solid. However, it's been mostly unenjoyable, which brings me to my first major quip with this game:1. The game is horribly optimizedI started up my game to my rider rising up an elevator in the first tutorial level. It was going pretty slowly, maybe for dramatic effect. And then the slowness carried on through the level. and the next one after that. What was the problem behind this? It turns out Trials Fusion is hellbent on running at 60 FPS. If you can't run it at 60 FPS, the game merely slows itself down until every in-game second has 60 frames. The result? If you run it at 40 FPS, every 3 real-life seconds becomes 2 seconds in-game. 30 FPS? Your game runs at half-speed. 20 FPS? A minute-long tracks now takes 3 minutes to complete. Have you ever put an old game in your floppy disc drive of your computer and it runs at lightning speed because the game speed was tied to processor speed? Trials Fusion goes 15 years into the past to bring back this experience. And don't you worry, they thought of that one supercomputer that can run the game at 90 FPS, so the game caps at 60 FPS so it doesn't run away.All in all, after crippling the resolution, video settings, and everything else, the game ran at an average of 45 FPS for me, where it started off at 15. My GPU may not be the greatest in the world (AMD Radeon HD 7640G), but it gets the job done for every other game I've played at decently high settings. Trials Fusion at its lowest possible settings still brings my GPU to its knees.2. uPlay is a piece of crap and attempted to eat my computerA little backstory here. I bought Burnout Paradise during the 2013 Summer Sale. Upon launching, EA promted me to make on Origin account, which I did. They didn't bug me any further, and from then on, Burnout launched through Steam and my Origin log-in was confirmed after launching.So why is it that Trials Fusion requires you to install uPlay, and that launching Trials from Steam only launches uPlay? If I only had to make a uPlay account to play (like with Burnout!), it would be fine. But why do I need a second game-launcher just to accomplish the task of launching my game, Ubisoft? So launching Trials Fusion is clumsy and weird because it requires installing uPlay, which seems bad enough. For me, however, it was the start of my problems.A couple of days after installing TF, Flash videos stopped working, which required me to disable hardware acceleration to fix. Whatever, Flash is buggy anyway. And then weird black bars appeared near the top of the window when I was watching a Twitch stream. OK, maybe something is wrong here, so I'll run an antivirus scan. My computer crashed mid-scan, and then I got my first blue screen the next day. The day after that the most ominous thing of all happened. I was watching a video when it flipped to another screen that said, ""You can activate your operating system under the Settings tab."" I went back to the video, and minimized my screen to reveal that I could now see my OS and build in the lower-right hand corner of my desktop. At that point, I went to System Restore and got uPlay the hell out of my computer. It's been about a month since the restore, and to date, nothing nearly as spooky as the aforementioned things has happened again.SUMMARY/TL;DR:You may notice next to the thumbs-down that I have 2 hours logged playing this game. This is due to a combination of the problems mentioned above. In my short time playing Trials Fusion, the gameplay wasn't that good for me, because it didn't run at full-speed. I can imagine it would be a great game if the damn thing would run correctly and stop being so picky. Ubisoft has done a decent job patching their errors, adding things like ""better"" optimization and custom Supercross tracks. Until they fix the bigger things though, I can't say anything good about this game. In conclusion...-Only get this game if you're absolutely confident in your computer's specs, ESPECIALLY GPU-Don't expect online play anytime soon (because the poor slow-motion guy would be left behind...)-uPlay is a piece of crap-If your computer fights back after installing uPlay, you should listen to it-#4spooky-I like donuts :3			"

												You can lose numerous hours playing and hunting times in this great game! You will also rage but it isn’t like most games because of the game mechanics it’s because of your ability, but this makes you strive for a better time and keeps you coming back to Trials Fusion.All impressive maps design, graphics Easter Eggs (Squirrels) bikes and customization and also challenges have been done brilliantly. Also after you have completed the campaign to your ability you can get stuck into user created tracks which further makes the game playable.The new addition to Trials Fusion which include the new FMX trick system is great too!Only a few minor downsides for me.. The voice/screaming of character gets quite annoying after a while although you can turn it off and the extreme track Inferno IV. That damn map! And obviously the biggest downside is Uplay!One recommendation which i would give is that you should use a controller as it is easier to control your bike.In summary this is a great game which you can easily rage but get addicted to. Ubisoft needs to stop using UPlay for future titles.9/10			"

												So here's the thing;If you're a massive trials fan (As I am) you are probably going to buy this game because it's trials. However for it's price it is not worth it at all, the only redeeming features of this game are the user generated tracks (which are great) and it looks pretty (clutching at straws now).If you want a great trials game buy Trials Evolution because that's where the series peaked. Also, damn Ubisoft.			"

												You can lose numerous hours playing and hunting times in this great game! You will also rage but it isn’t like most games because of the game mechanics it’s because of your ability, but this makes you strive for a better time and keeps you coming back to Trials Fusion.All impressive maps design, graphics Easter Eggs (Squirrels) bikes and customization and also challenges have been done brilliantly. Also after you have completed the campaign to your ability you can get stuck into user created tracks which further makes the game playable.The new addition to Trials Fusion which include the new FMX trick system is great too!Only a few minor downsides for me.. The voice/screaming of character gets quite annoying after a while although you can turn it off and the extreme track Inferno IV. That damn map! And obviously the biggest downside is Uplay!One recommendation which i would give is that you should use a controller as it is easier to control your bike.In summary this is a great game which you can easily rage but get addicted to. Ubisoft needs to stop using UPlay for future titles.9/10			"

												I want to start off with the good parts of this game. I played the previous Trials games on the console and I was hoping that I could continue the series on PC. To an extent, I did. The gameplay was as I remember, i.e., incredibly addicting and rewarding. If you were to compare stills of this game to the previous games, you could tell it looks incredibly better. But after I got past the introductory phase, I started realising how annoying logging into Uplay was. I also ran into frame rate problems. I'm not implying that I'm running a powerful system (my graphics card being a Radeon HD 7870), but compared to the smooth 60 fps I can maintain on medium settings in Metro: Last Light and Bioshock Infinity, I found the 40 fps and often 20 fps on low settings to be COMPLETELY absurd. I'm quite offended that the developers put less care to the PC version but I suppose it's my fault for assuming otherwise from Ubisoft. Although I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, I cannot recommend it to anyone without a more powerful system. The low fps is more than nauseating as usual but actually disruptive in the gameplay. Please play the demo, which I'm very grateful is provided, before thinking of purchasing it; something I was too anxious to do.			"

												This is the first Trials game I've played and I'm really enjoying it with the exception of two things.1: Lags all the time for no good reason. The internet's only solution is to decrease the resolution, but I'm at the minimum res and it's still doing it.2: Why isn't there a female rider? It's 2014, why can't I play as a girl in a motocross game? I could play as a girl in the freaking PS2's ATV Offroad Fury 2 and that came out in the early 2000s. There's literally no reason to not have a female body option.Game itself is gorgeous and fun and, provided the lag holds off or is somehow solvable, I'll be playing a lot of this.			"

												If you like Trials for the multiplayer, this is easily the worst. After months of no custom multiplayer maps, now there are around 10-20 available to download, to add to the 12-odd which come with the game. In all, you can play them in an afternoon, if that. Aside from this, the game has no real improvements from Evolution. If you want Trials, get that instead. Cheaper and more maps, without being any different graphically.			"

												NOTE: This is a long, detailed review. Longness may occur past this point.I had never played a Trials game before, but was familiar with the series, so I bought Fusion before the Summer Sale ended. I figured I'd be playing it a lot over the summer and as a general timewaster, so I bought the Season Pass with it, for a total of $30.Honestly, I feel like I've wasted my money buying this game.Having never played any other Trials games, I have nothing to compare the gameplay of Fusion against. I do know that it has no online multiplayer, which is a major disappointment. Looking through other reviews, I can see that the game is apparently lacking in other places (lack of tracks, buggy trick system, etc.), but again, I have nothing to compare it against, so I can't verify these claims. In my 2 hours of playing, the core gameplay has been solid. However, it's been mostly unenjoyable, which brings me to my first major quip with this game:1. The game is horribly optimizedI started up my game to my rider rising up an elevator in the first tutorial level. It was going pretty slowly, maybe for dramatic effect. And then the slowness carried on through the level. and the next one after that. What was the problem behind this? It turns out Trials Fusion is hellbent on running at 60 FPS. If you can't run it at 60 FPS, the game merely slows itself down until every in-game second has 60 frames. The result? If you run it at 40 FPS, every 3 real-life seconds becomes 2 seconds in-game. 30 FPS? Your game runs at half-speed. 20 FPS? A minute-long tracks now takes 3 minutes to complete. Have you ever put an old game in your floppy disc drive of your computer and it runs at lightning speed because the game speed was tied to processor speed? Trials Fusion goes 15 years into the past to bring back this experience. And don't you worry, they thought of that one supercomputer that can run the game at 90 FPS, so the game caps at 60 FPS so it doesn't run away.All in all, after crippling the resolution, video settings, and everything else, the game ran at an average of 45 FPS for me, where it started off at 15. My GPU may not be the greatest in the world (AMD Radeon HD 7640G), but it gets the job done for every other game I've played at decently high settings. Trials Fusion at its lowest possible settings still brings my GPU to its knees.2. uPlay is a piece of crap and attempted to eat my computerA little backstory here. I bought Burnout Paradise during the 2013 Summer Sale. Upon launching, EA promted me to make on Origin account, which I did. They didn't bug me any further, and from then on, Burnout launched through Steam and my Origin log-in was confirmed after launching.So why is it that Trials Fusion requires you to install uPlay, and that launching Trials from Steam only launches uPlay? If I only had to make a uPlay account to play (like with Burnout!), it would be fine. But why do I need a second game-launcher just to accomplish the task of launching my game, Ubisoft? So launching Trials Fusion is clumsy and weird because it requires installing uPlay, which seems bad enough. For me, however, it was the start of my problems.A couple of days after installing TF, Flash videos stopped working, which required me to disable hardware acceleration to fix. Whatever, Flash is buggy anyway. And then weird black bars appeared near the top of the window when I was watching a Twitch stream. OK, maybe something is wrong here, so I'll run an antivirus scan. My computer crashed mid-scan, and then I got my first blue screen the next day. The day after that the most ominous thing of all happened. I was watching a video when it flipped to another screen that said, ""You can activate your operating system under the Settings tab."" I went back to the video, and minimized my screen to reveal that I could now see my OS and build in the lower-right hand corner of my desktop. At that point, I went to System Restore and got uPlay the hell out of my computer. It's been about a month since the restore, and to date, nothing nearly as spooky as the aforementioned things has happened again.SUMMARY/TL;DR:You may notice next to the thumbs-down that I have 2 hours logged playing this game. This is due to a combination of the problems mentioned above. In my short time playing Trials Fusion, the gameplay wasn't that good for me, because it didn't run at full-speed. I can imagine it would be a great game if the damn thing would run correctly and stop being so picky. Ubisoft has done a decent job patching their errors, adding things like ""better"" optimization and custom Supercross tracks. Until they fix the bigger things though, I can't say anything good about this game. In conclusion...-Only get this game if you're absolutely confident in your computer's specs, ESPECIALLY GPU-Don't expect online play anytime soon (because the poor slow-motion guy would be left behind...)-uPlay is a piece of crap-If your computer fights back after installing uPlay, you should listen to it-#4spooky-I like donuts :3			"

												I feel like you have to know what Trials is before you play it. If you don't, you might be very surprised after playing it for a bit. The first set of levels are simple and enjoyable. The middle ones are pretty tough. The final tracks will frustrate the hell out of you. Some tracks are normal trials, then others are stunt tracks and mini games. Most of the tracks have 3 bonus challenges, so there are reasons to go back and revisit all of them. You can also try to beat your friends times (and scores I think) on each track.I haven't even downloaded any player created courses yet, but I know from playing Trials Evolution on Xbox 360 that people make some crazy stuff to play.I think most people can enjoy this game. The controls are simple, but challenging to perfect in the later levels. The game provides a great challenge for people, but casual players can enjoy it too.			"

This game has everything Evolution had and 5 times more. The stunning graphics, engaging setting and plot, FMX, and even more features in the editor are just a few of the great new things about this game. The one huge downside is the necessity of Uplay. It's really just a pain in the butt. However, the rewards and stuff along with the Trial Frontier connection kind of make up for the inconvenience. Seriously a 10/10.			"

												I bought Trials Fusion when it came on sale a week after I first tried my first Trials game (Trials Evolution Gold). It was a pleasant upgrade in graphics and gameplay and I am quite in love with this game. It has a range of levels across many beautiful vistas. I enjoy the skill games that throw some extra spice into the regular levels. The difficulty of those levels scales nicely from pretty easy (even for someone who is not particularly familiar with this style of game) all the way up to the excruciatingly difficult and playing with mates is better than it ever was. Hitting those jumps perfectly can be amazingly satisfying.A+, I love this game, buy it now.Pros:1.	Hundreds of free tracks online2.	A range of difficulties to suit everybody3.	Online and local multiplayer (I am talking split screen!)4.	In game track builder5.	Character/Bike customization and unlockables6.	Sweet sweet Trials game play7.	Best Trials graphics to dateCons:1.

												It's Trials. If you enjoy previous games you will enjoy this.It starts easy enough for anyone to understand and learn the basics. And when the game isnt challenging enough for you the community takes over and provides you with maps ranging from ""fun"" to impossible. The editor is amzing for what it is. You can create anything you want really.I see a lot of people having problems with CTD and such, so far I have not had any issues at all. Maybe I'm one of the lucky few. I can only write a review based on my on experience, not what others have reported, and so far I love it.			"

												Every now ad then I still play this title even though I find it incredibly frustrating to play. The only reason why I do is because I purchased the Season Pass, so I feel obligated to play when the new content releases. I feel that Trials Evolution was the pinnacle to this franchise. The tracks aren't nearly as fun to play in Fusion. The FMX tracks are a joke and would have been an addition that should have been subtracted. To say that I enjoy playing them would be the same as anyone saying they love a mouth full of cavities. I suggest that if you want to play a great Trials game then please pick up Evolution. Or grab any tablet and play Frontier (that one is actually a ton of fun).			"

												I love this game. I have more hours offline than what my account shows. This was my first experience with Trials series (I did play Evo after this game to compare) and between the two, they are fairly equal. This game offers better graphics than Evo and the challenges are fun to complete as well. I went ahead and purchased the season pass as well (for $16 for the game plus all dlc, can't complain). This is not an easy game by any means, and to be honest, this game (as straight forward as it is) SHOULD be a boring game. However, it's not even close! I can spend 30 minutes perfecting a 40 second track, trying to complete the challenges, restarting the level 100 times, blah blah blah, AND still love doing it. It is exciting, fast paced and gives you a good laugh. You will get frustrated from time to time, but I can't think of a game where I haven't been. I have been having some issues connecting to multiplayer, so for that reason I would score this a 9.5/10. If Evo goes on sale ever as well, I will be purchasing that one too. If you are new to the series, then I recommend 100%. If you are a seasoned player, I suggest reading other players reviews and deciding off of their reviews as I have not had enough time yet to get into the heart of the game.			"

												This has been this worst year for ubisoft, all there games have been horrible. Every year they get worse, but they have reached and all time peak. I really used to like your games, I'm just done. You have lost a customer.			"

												Hard, fun, and rewarding. Sadly it would appear one of the dlcs is not included in the season pass, which is very frustrating.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is actually really fun. The problem I have with it, is that it will not boot. It just crashes as soon as it tries to load. Well done Ubisoft, you have made another game which does not work on pc. I had to edit the graphics configuration *myself* in order to get this game to boot. I should not have to finish coding the game for you in order to get the game to launch, and yes, this game has had numerous patches supposedly fixing all the problems it came with when it was released (HA!).This has just solidified my reasoning that Ubisoft really doesn't care about the consumer.

												Great difficulty and nice futuristic theme. Nonetheless, the motorcycles do not feel very futuristic.+infuriating difficulty+different behavior of the motorcycles match different level layouts+deep control system with emphasis on leaning the right way and breaking or accelerating at the right time; much deeper than those browser games+local multiplayer, sadly way more simplistic and uninspired than the single player levels-uplay-sometimes it is not very clear whenever a jump is a success or not because jumping often needs a special sequence of leaning inputs in a short ammount of time-stunt/trick system controls a bit wobbly as sometimes inputs are not accepted because of fast spinning (does that count as realism?)-game gets harder with your controller having a big deadzone. I cannot recommend Logitech devices-annoying menu design as it takes away from the futuristic theme and tries to sell you DLC all the time-game throws you out of a level if you need to many retries, erasing your checkpoint progressAll in all i can recommend this game despite it being an Ubisoft game. It is really fun after you finally are ingame and out of the disgusting and irritating menu screen.Keep in mind that this is the darksouls of motorcycle games so prepare to die.			"
