												The one positive thing about this game is that at least now I have a new worst game in my library. If you've ever played Octodad or Surgeon Simulator and thought ""hey these controls are real wonky but it's still fun"" well then this game is like that. Without the fun part. And the ""soundtrack"" only serves to fuel anger. Wow.			"

												Very fun to get better at riding the bikes.  Feel like I'm always getting better.  Just trying to get in the flow of riding, sometimes I'm there and sometimes I just lose it.  Hopefully once I learn I'll never forget.Art and music are also fun.  Excited to play with friends sometime, been fun solo tho.			"

												This is an extremely fun game to spend some of your life on. The price point is low and yet the quality is quite high. I especially like the penguins that are to overweight to stand and therefore just roll around.If you would like to see how the game plays, you can do so here:
