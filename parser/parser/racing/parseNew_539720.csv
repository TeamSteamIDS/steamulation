												- Its cheap- The achievements are not super difficult, but getting to level 10 can be a bit tricky- Each vehicle appears to have a slightly different powerup available as well as color scheme for the gameplay- The levels are randomly generated so it keeps things fresh, but at the same time this makes it so memorizing the levels is impossible.  ;)- Fuel is very important, so don't be afraid to drive slowly to make sure you have time to react to grab fuel.I recommend this one, it may not take you long to get all the cars and achievements if you're really good or a little bit lucky.One BIG Warning though... after about 15 minutes of playing this game my eyes were tripping out, so I recommend not playing this for extended periods of time if your eyes are sensitive to flashing and moving bright lights.

												Update: Devs made a stealth patch (unannounced) and the top scrolling speed was slowed down to give players a full second to react to finding fuel stations. Makes it truer to being a casual high score racing game as advertised and actually fun to play. Still has low replay value, but it is worth buying for the soundtrack alone, now that it is included at the base price.Original Review:It's more of a rage game than casual. Imagine going at the speed of sound and seeing enough of the screen ahead of you to make a 0.3 second reaction. The fuel is a timer, not measured off speed which isn't a bad thing, just something to be weary of considering the gas stations aren't frequent and they can sometimes spawn in areas  the player can't reach. Combined with the short reaction time, the gas stations are frequent panic attacks than sighs of relief.It does fit the bill as a simple racing game and mimics arcade classics, so it isn't terrible. It isn't good and due to not needing much skill to do well in it, lowers the replay value by quite a bit.For Achievement Hunters only: 3/10			"

												A Very fun racing game, that looks exactly like those race arcade machines from 80-90's:+Looks nice and fits that old game's style+Simple gameplay but you will need to have a high reaction speed.+Various color palettes to unlock, various 80's memes.-Power-ups that make your life harder instead :\+Steam achievements - hard to get+Steam cards and low price = this game is close to be freeDefinitely guaranteed half an hour of fun time, or even more if you really enjoy the games of that genre.

												Great game for 65 cents. Its a flash game but you can play full screen.Great techno music.You have 10 cars to unlock.Each car has its own colour/map.Reminds me of a game i played on NES (Road Fighter) when I was a kid: when you hit a car you basically tumble to hit the sides and game over/restart.

												Fun little game, brings back the old school games that were purely based on challenge and how good you were.Its very light with a few neat unlockables. I'm not that good at this yet, but past level 7 it begins to get tough as the computer cars change up their patterns. This game does require quick thinking and reaction. Its great if you're a keyboard gamer and like old school emulation. Electronic soundtrack is pretty fitting for it.Nice job.			"

												A top down racing game where you have to avoid crashing into the walls (and if going more than medium pace, cars which spin you into walls if you hit them) and run over the petrol pumps to extend your timer - while it seems like it should be a fuel gauge, it goes down at the same speed whether you are going top speed or crawling along at a snails pace, so functionally it is a timer. This gives the odd situation that if you are running low on ""fuel"" you have to nail the accelerator in the hope you make it to the next fuel station in time.The early levels (1-4) play quite well, you can go flat out in light traffic, and the challenge of hitting at least every third or so fuel pump while also avoiding cars makes for quite a good balance. This all starts to fall apart from the 5th level with the combination of regular narrow 2 lane sections that make it impossible not to slow down to a much more sedate pace, plus a new type of car in the traffic that bounces from wall to wall, which are bad enough to deal with in the full width sections, but basically make going any faster than about 150 suicidal from that point on.If you can make it pootling along to level 10-11 it then gets worse, as you end up stuck on an almost continuously 2 narrow lane setup, which briefly widens regularly but no usually long enough to overtake anything. Meanwhile a mass of purple cars that all go the same speed and move to block you appear and quickly there are dozens of them making it impossible to do anything but chug along behind them at a tepid pace.Overall I can't really recommend this, if the difficulty of the traffic ramped up slowly following the patterns at the beginning of the game it could have been fairly decent, but everything after that is poor and gets worse. Also this game randomly appeared in my games list a few weeks back, and I have no idea why - was it meant to be a free review copy, not sure.			"

												I think this is one of the example games that comes with Game Maker. There's not a great deal of content, in the sense that there's maybe 10 minutes in it. There's so much empty space on the screen and the road that you'll miss half the stuff on the road by virtue of being too far away and will only really crash or pick up fuel when it happens to spawn in your lane.
