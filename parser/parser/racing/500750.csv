								Good Points:-Driving through the rain, grass or dirt makes it harder to drive, gives the driving experience a realistic feel.-Car damage dynamics adds an element to the game which makes you think twice before ramming.-Car sound is believable and fun.-Graphics are nice-The game works as a complete package which is playable and funFor Improvement:-Camera jitter on third person camera can be smoothed out-Drifting on the back wheels can add another option for turning rather than slowing down-Auto reset the car after a brief period when flipped overThe game is fun to play and I am looking forward to see how it improves on its release.

								Aftre a crazy weekend with this game and steam I had placed a bad review and requested a refund. These folks come to work and go to work and fix the problems and make me very happly customer. The game it's self is more than worth it. The the ideas that are in place and the solid game play this can only get better. The company behind the game <TGI and The Gaming Institute>  Now this is a company that I can get behind, setting a great example for the future devlopers. As an Early Access release, I highly Recommend.			"

								I have been playing this game for a few hours now and I am amazed of how detailed and beautifully crafted is this game. I am impressed how the game scenarios are recreated to perfection and the beauty of the visuals.The cars physics work nicely, the driving is soft an accurate, very easy to control. I had no problems driving and I was only using a keyboard.I could not stop paying attention to the details, see how the smoke of the tires in sudden braking of closed curves, how the cars react in case of accidents, both physically, as well as the reaction of the AI. I also noted that if the cars suffers a lot of damage, the performance of the vehicle is affected.The cars leave marks when they brake or slide, the light effects and the use of shadows are awesome. The developers certainly put a lot of efforts in the eye candy. All those details require a lot of work and it is admirable how an Indie development team was able to pull this out and make it look nice and coherent.I definitely recommend this game, it is easy to play, it is simple, intuitive and fun.

								I really like this game!  The graphics are great and the game is challenging but fun.  The third person view is my favorite and I like the look of the speedometer from that view.   I love the rain, it looks really awesome!  Great job!  I look forward to playing this game again.			"

								After having played GI Racing (the original game). I can definitely say that GI Racing 2.0 has many improvemnets, the controls seem very fluid and the core game mechanics are in place. The GUI is very user friendly and has a great UX for the players. I will enjoy playing this game the more it grows and look forward to see what the future holds for it. Great Work Guys. I highly recommend this game if you fancy burning some rubber around some visually stunning tracks to satisfy your urge for speeding around the raceway at almost 200mph.. NICE!Keep up the good work. Cheers.			"

								I played GI Racing 2 at the fastest graphics setting with a low end computer ( stock laptop bought at Best Buy ) and experienced no lag.  The racing action was face paced and exciting.  The tracks were extremely detailed with nice vegetation, stands, wet conditions, rain, etc...  The lighting and shadows were awesome.  The physics were excellent.  I could feel the road while I was playing the game.  The camera inside of the car was impressive.  I really liked the gps gizmo that displayed the map of the track ( I have never seen that in a racing game before).  The side camera was awesome because I could really see all of the track and the details of the other cars.  The chase camera gave a nice rear view of your car.  The sound effects were very cool.  I really liked the sound of the engine smoothly switching gears.  I really like the closing credits song also.  Good Game all around.			"

								GI Racing 2.0 is coming along nicely and for an Early Access of $9.99 it is a great value even in its current state. Requires little to no experience in racing sims - you have the option to jump right in and start playing. Controls are intuitive, the driving mecanics are well balanced and responsive (I am using cursor keys). Artificial Intelligence is believable. Had a chance to drive in the opposite direction and watch the other drivers avoid me while attempting to avoid other AI drivers. There is a damage system that certainly effects gameplay. For example, I damaged both my headlights during an evening race making it tough to see where I was going.  Physics is good as well even in its early state - I think there is potential for even more dynamic interactions. I am looking forward to the next iteration of this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Nothing like wrecking your car after a really tiring day!Let me start with a short verdict for this game: I liked it, it was fun, challenging and engaging.Now the details:From technical point of view, it's ticking pretty well. No bugs or glitches encountered, everything ran smoothly. There's only one place where the sound starts ""quipping"" (I think that's the word..?) for a few seconds, then everything's normal again.The controls are pretty simple, though I still took a few minutes to get used to it, and it turnes out driving while squinting through a shattered glass can be a lot of fun too. :D In all seriousness, I haven't played a racing game in years, but got into it pretty quickly. Graphics are, well, unfinished, as simple as that. Of course, the game will probably go through a lot of polishing before the final release, so I'm not concerned. It didn't burn my eyes, just... those bump maps are not presentable. ;)Soundtrack... I've missed the soundtrack, I hope they work on it soon, though I understand there are more urgent things on the developers' to-do list at the moment. I strongly advise devs to work on menu options. It was a little confusing to navigate through those screens, while I did manage to get where I wanted, directions weren't as obvious at a glance as it should've been. A ""back"" button for every page!In general, I guess I've already said it, but I'll repeat, it's a fun, challenging game, has this oldish flare to it. Heck, even the game icon reminded me of old games - I'm saying this in a good way btw, has all the enjoyability a good racing game should have, and I'll happily wait for the final release. :)			"

								Although I recieved this game from the developer it in no way affects my opinion of it.I loved the graphics, they are very smooth. The controls were easy to understand.  I however suck at driving, and often broke the windshield which can make it difficult to see.    I also found driving on what would normally be the passenger side of the vehicle for me to be slightly disorienting.All in all I love the game, once I got used to positioning the vehicle.  Great Job, can't wait to see the final product.10/10			"

								To me this feels like a classic old style racer does with todays tech and for at least, that's a good thing. I have a mid range PC anf was able to maintain a sold 60fps at all times, this was at beautiful setting via the pre game config window.. Let's also remeber this is very early access and as with most of these games, they do look better at release. As it stands, the visuals and  great for what the game is.I also think the devs did a great job with the damage model and the sounds when the cars hit things.So yeah, for me it's a big thumbs up and I am looking forward to more content.

								Had this game a few days now. The environment is vastly improved over the original GI racing. The cars and back drops are visually pleasing with damage effects one of the best I have seen on a racing game. The AI of the other drivers has meant a re-think on how I pass some of them, unlike the barge and push in other racing games the damage soon adds up and takes its toll on your race during the straights.The audio effects scraping along the walls and sound of the PC drivers closing in on you adds to the dramatic realism of the title and consequently puts this title in my top ten for the price. The developers have worked hard on the title and it can clearly be seen in the game play compared to the older version.With further tracks in development this is one to keep an eye on. "

								I don't usually buy into early access as I don't like taking risks. I decided I liked the look and the feel of this so I supported it in greenlight and have kept an eye on it. A friend of mine has a membership ay the game institute, the companyy that are making the game and teaching member how to make it so I knew a little about it so thought I would take the plunge.AM I glad I did! The feel and controls of the game, I'm playing on an xbox 360 controller, are very very good indeed. There is a much bigger amount of content in the early access version than I thought there would be and the different weather conditions are very nice. Sooo glad there is a cockpit view as I can't play any other way, bonnet view is good too but it's cockpit for me all the way. The game is challenging but with a few races under my belt I am geting used to it and not coming last anymore. It feels very compitent in the way the other cars are programmed and I don't feel like I'm playing an indie game. Well done Devs, keep up the good work and can't wait for more tracks and cars.			"

								Hey Guys ,I realy don't understand the bad reviews.GI Racing 2.0 is a nice Race Game i enjoy to playin' it reminds me on the old days and exactly this makes it so unique for me.It feels like a honest Racing Game and the devolpers put some heart ,soul and sweat into it the enviroment in the Backround is pretty amazing most of the racing games didn't put much attention into that.Graphic and perfomance I realy don't know why ppl have problems with that I have a mediocore Pc and it works great without laggs.Like I said its a honest Racing Game and for such a long time I was not only thinking I play a race game I feel it also which to be honest a lot of AAA titles can't offer these days.I want a race game and GI Racing offers me that whats wrong with the engine Sounds that was Racing is loud noise and you smelll the petrol in the Air.You don't buy a Ferrari cuz the Audio Sytem is great you buy it cuz when you start the Engine you get some goosebumps.And the best thing is on the Game Institute Website I can also learn how to make  a game like this and many other stuff who is interested in that things.The game is also in early Acces and the Devolpers work also on more Content that is coming and have a open ear for any suggestions and listen to the community ( and ther customers).Keep in  mind that this a not a game makin by a huge company with hundreds of ppl working on it and a big budget its made by ppl who love gaming and this is what you can see in GI Racing 2.0.All have to say is the Game is worth the Money and many thanks to the Devolpers keeping up the good work.Regards Deangelo			"

Early Access Review
EDIT - Review updated 07/26/2016:After my initial review yesterday, the developer has worked on and released a patch for the game which has dramatically fixed a lot of the issues. The camera in the third person is much better now and i noticed no focus loss. The track ""Long beach"" has had some sort of graphical and lighting change which makes it looks much better and brighter and the FPS i got in-game were also 100+ FPS now.The game really has potential and the developers are pretty active as they fixed most of the issues i had within a day and hopefully they work on sound and more race tracks and make the game even better. I would recommend this game now! I have also updated my score up above as per the new improved game.Note: I was provided a key for this game by “TeamTom Reviews”, who, in turn received the key from the publishers. This does not change my views and opinions on the game.GI racing 2.0 is a racing game which tries to do too many things at once and fails at all of them. The game is in Early Access and it clearly shows it’s not complete yet. The game tries to be an arcade racer yet has features of a realistic racing simulation game. The controls feel floaty and the game runs pretty bad too with stuttering.Graphics:The game’s graphics are pretty bad and look so dull and gloomy. I didn’t like the way the game looked at all. The game’s pretty bad in optimization as I had ~35-40FPS throughout the gameplay. I noticed stuttering as well.Sound:Music is nonexistent apart from the main menu, you won’t hear a thing in races other than the obnoxiously loud engine sound (yes, I turned the ‘car’ volume almost all the way down in the options menu already). Gameplay:Gameplay is your standard races in different maps. There seem to be only 2 different tracks. These tracks come in different variations e.g. a track could be in day time, night time, or day time with wet track etc. There’s a quick play mode where you can select a track and just start playing right away or go for the ‘Tournament’ mode if you have the patience.The controls feel very floaty and the camera is all over the place. If you play in the cockpit view mode, it’s not that bad but for someone who prefers the third person behind the car camera angle it can be problematic.There's a camera problem, when you press brake fast and try to turn, the camera goes out of focus on the car and you cannot see your car and cannot make adjustments to make the turn properly. There are many other problems such as the car sliding out of control at just even touching the other car at slow speeds, so physics is also not the best in the game. When you turn or move right and left the car feels like it’s strafing left and right and not turning. I usually don’t give such harsh reviews but in this game’s case I had to. I only played 20 minutes and I couldn’t take it anymore. Just look at the gameplay video posted below as words can’t describe these. Check out my attempt to play a serious game and giving up.

Suggestions for the developer to improve the game:You need to improve the game’s performance, I can run games that are much better looking at 60 FPS or above. Fix the camera angle problem.Add some soundtracks and please make the engine sound a bit quieter. Car’s turning doesn’t feel natural, make it so it doesn’t feel like car is strafing left and right and actually turning. Either be an arcade racer or be a simulation racer, don’t try to do both things at once. When going the wrong way, a message should appear telling the player they’re going In the wrong direction. Add more tracks.I hope you can improve your game and I wish you all the best!Graphics: 7/10Sound: 3/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 7/10Conclusion:If you’re looking for a racing game, look elsewhere. In this state the game is almost unplayable (at least for me it was). The graphics suck, the optimization is horrible, the sound sucks, $13 for this game is a bit steep, maybe pick it up when on sale. I feel pretty bad giving an indie developer such a harsh review but it had to be done.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me start by saying the game has potential, but you need to do a lot more to impress others and myself, all you have is 2 Tracks and Holdens no other make of cars it's boring as hell, and i am from Australia and in the V8 Supercars series we have Holden and Ford the main Rivalry, we also have Nissan, Volvo, Mercedes, and we have many different Tracks with our V8 Supercars Philip Island, Sandown, Sydney, Tasmania, Queensland and many more, so you need to do a lot more if you want the Australian people to start buying from you. The actual sound from the Holden exhaust is really bad and that needs fixing, also the game is not smooth to play, i would like to see better sponsor names on the cars and billboards, your main sponsor is Supercheap Auto so just rename that to Specialcheap auto and it will look better then Maxvalue auto, and do the same with the sponsorship names on the cars as they look odd, also you need to allow players to do car setups in the garage, and what about pit stops they are a major part in V8 Supercars racing, and the other thing is the crowd especially on the top of Mount Panorama (Bathurst) you must show the crowd and certain areas on the top of the mountain is Holden fans and other areas have Ford fans and they show their Flags with the Holden and Ford emblems. The graphics in this game is very poor for even early access stage, I think that you need to really improve the graphics asap, because you don’t show any high quality anywhere in the game. If these things can be fixed, edited and added what I mentioned above I think you will start getting a lot more people buying early access and the word of mouth will be positive reaction about this game.

Early Access Review
								I like it quite a lot, it's a bit more simulation than the Forza's while still being quite fun with a controller.It has its issues like my i5 6400 w/rx480 has some stuttering in the highest graphics setting while at the beautiful setting it runs almost as well on my Phenom II 955 w/R9 285...which makes no sense at all but it is Unity based so I guess it may have something to do with that....maybe.... (or Win X vs. Win 7...)It sometimes seem to go a tad berserk with sensitivity but that may be me not used to the game and therefore flooring it a tad too much, not sure it's just something I've noticed occassionally but it has always happened by making you over compensate after a straight and not while in/entering it so it may be me doing something wrong due to not being used to the game.Physics when hitting the wall may have the car leaning against in on two wheels, very far from actual physics as you'd either flip the car or drive it down again....So far it may seem like I'm only complaining but those are my complaintzs and one may be me, one's easily fixed by lowering graphics and you can't reaally tell the difference TBH and the last can easily be fixed by a patch...and (again) TBH, if it happens it's really due to the gamer screwing up the corner...It is a nice racing game I'm quite a big fan of the Flatout's and Rally trophy (both made by Bugbear) but I'd say this is better than Wreckfest, it's a more complete game, it has a lot better interface and if you were to ask me which to buy I'd tell you to go for this one unless your desire is to go off the course and smash things this is the better game ♥♥♥ it stands. (and I do hope they'll keep on developing it, it's not that it absolutely craves an update but I did have to lower my sensitivity to 10-15% which means the base setting's waaaay too high)			"

Early Access Review
								I have followed the development process of this game through being a student of The Game Institute and was always impressed by the thought and effort that was going into even the smallest of aspects of the game. Basically, I couldn’t wait to play it and I must say I love it (and I am not easily pleased when it comes to games). I like the simplicity of driving a race car around a track at speed and find the graphics very pleasing while the games challenging. The UI is easy to work with and the game elements like trophies and different weathers makes the game challenging. Simple errors can cost you time and race places very easily and damage to your car will slow you down so be careful. The game camera is versatile and allows for different views while racing quickly and again during the action replays to see what went wrong. In my case always too fast into the corner.The developers seem to have taken on-board other people requests for modification / fixes and have improved the game since its first release. This is definably one to add to your library and, for me, is a go to game when looking for a quick gaming fix or something a bit longer with a challenge. "

								Old school racing aesthetics with modern graphics appeal.I had trouble with the joystick control at first due to the sensitivity of the sticks, but that was fixed in the patch.Really like the feel of driving the cars and the immersive feeling I got when driving in the rain.I think the development team is 'spot on' with responding to feedback and addressing the early access issues as they come up.
