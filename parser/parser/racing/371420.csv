tl;drA worth-while entry in the Kart Racer genre that is entirely over-looked because it's a Floppy Ear title! Fun for all ages and a Buy for Kart Racing enthusiasts.full review.Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race is a cute, little Kart Racer that has more going on than you can shake a stick at.  It has several racing modes, several kart performance upgrades, plenty of unlockables from cars to characters, several difficulty levels to accomodate racers of all skill-levels and some beautiful and cartoony courses with enough variety to keep it interesting.  Best of all, it has a surprisingly solid sense of speed, which is core to any good racing game.  It's unfortunate that this game doesn't get a fair chance inspite of it's lineage; from the perspective of a single-player Kart Racer, it's pretty darn good.  There are, however, some minor problems:First: the wonky controls. They are soft and slippery.  They can almost feel broken when you first start playing.  But... once you adapt to the steering mechanics and adjust your driving style, you will find yourself speeding around corners and passing your competitors with ease and glee. The learning curve for me was about 45-minutes of race-time. Second: The weird music.And as far as the music goes, it's weird and a total mismatch for what is happening on-screen. Turn it off in the Settings and play your own up-tempo music of choice.  I played EDM and Trance for this game and it kicked up the atmosphere to eleven.Once you disable the weirdly mismatched music and spend some time learning how to control your racer... it becomes really fun!It's definitely no Sonic Racer, but, it's certainly better and more fun than, the albeit more polished, F1 Race All-stars.  Of all the Kart Racers on Steam, it's a worth-while one. At full price (4,99 at the time of this review), I would recommend this for Kart Racing enthusiasts. However, if you enjoy Kart Racing and are the type of gamer who is willing to put a bit of time into learning how to steer your kart, then this is an easy Buy, especially if you get it on sale. pros.+ Cute pseudo-paper-cutout graphics style+ Well-designed tracks, including shortcuts+ Beautifully cartoony tracks+ Fun and responsive power-ups and attacks+ Day and night tracks+ Good AI competitors+ Solid sense of speed+ Split-screen, local multiplayer (I didn't test this)+ Many unlockables (tracks, cars, characters, etc)+ Kart performance upgrades (tires, exhaust, paint jobs, etc)+ Full 1080P Support+ Full Controller Supportcons.- Music is just terrible  (turn it off and play your own)- Kart controls are sloppy, but fun once you adapt- No online multiplayer support- Limited graphics settingsThis game is appropriate for all ages and skill-levels.Please hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.

												I love Teddy Floppy Ear, but I think this game might be too difficult for the age range the other games are targeted at. It's hard not to wreck. This game is good for older kids, but not very young. I enjoy the game otherwise.			"

												The game looks cute and simple enough but wait until you give it a few test runs.. Yes the game is fun but issue is at least for me the controls. You def need to keep your finger on the gas and slowly release it on the turns or you keep your finger on the gas and break on turns smoothly in order to make decent turns. So I believe this game requires more skill then expected. Keep in mind you must make a lot of SHARP turns to avoid other npc hurtful pickups and track obsticles.So if you are looking for an easy 100% or a casual game I don't think this is a fit but believe it or not this is a bit more ""competative"" then what it looks like lol at least for my noobie skills. I still will play it but I do not see myself playing it a lot since it only has local co-op. So if you are looking for something like this then this is the game for you but don't be fooled by how kiddie it looks!			"

												I bought this game for my young sons, expecting something similar to Sonic Racing or Mario Kart.   It's nothing like that.Multiplayer is somewhat supported, meaning it will supposedly offer two-player split screen racing.  However, when we tried it, none of the controls would work.  Plus, apparently only one controller is supported, so the second player would need to use the keyboard.  At least, I think so, because we could not actually get it working. We did get it to work on single player.  However, the sound effects are offensively bad, the controls are terrible, and the car would often just flip over for no reason.   Not fun, not entertaining, and certainly not worth the several dollars we paid for the game. There was only one review when I bought the game, and it was positive.   Now there's a realistic review, so you've been warned.			"

												This game, is certainly not what you expect. It starts off as a goofy non-serious kart racer until you actually start getting into the racing. The racing itself feels more like it is trying to be a simulator. You need to know racing lines, and the slow in fast out techniques that apply in Gran Turismo, Forza, and Project Cars. Combine that with some seriously goofy weapons. That said, i am rather surprised at how fluent the controls are on the gamepad. I went into this cracking up thinking ""what on Earth am i buying for a dollar."" to going ""wow, this is rather fun!'. Needless to stay i am still dieing whenever i see the name of this. The music on the other hand.. i am indifferent to it, it isn't bad, yet it isn't great. I'd recommend playing your own stuff after a while. I would not recommend this for young kids who may not be experienced with simulators, this game is deceptive and they will get frusturated quickly. I certainly was not expecting the sim aspect. Think Gran Turismo with the option to cheat with goofy weapons and oil slicks. I have only played about 15 minutes, but i must say i am pleasantly surprised by the gameplay itself. Kudos to the devs on a job well done.			"

												Delightful racing game similar to Mario Kart series. Likable characters, easy interface, nice variety of race types, etc.The game suffers from a major flaw. It is WAY too hard for its intended audience which is children. The NPC characters are too unforgiving of mistakes and children will be frustrated. At higher difficulties and tracks, some of the races are very difficult. I am a seasoned Mario Kart player and even I have difficulty winning some races or time trials. I’m guessing it would be near impossible for younger kids, especially if they have not been brought up on keyboard only controls (see below).99% of the races are determined by fractions of second (which makes it even odder why the developers chose to use whole second rather than hundredths), often with racers crossing the finish line at the same time.I found the controls simple unlike many other reviewers. You basically only use A W D and the space bar with an occasional S key thrown in when you screw up and have to back up…not sure what all the fuss is. I think many Steam users are console immigrants or are not old school keyboarders (read: spoiled). The controls are fine the way they are.While the game has cute elements and is very enjoyable, overall I cannot recommend the game as it will not appeal to its target audience. "

Its more playable than the Hello Kitties racer but still no Mario kart, The main issue is it feels a little flat.This is from some children series.Your car won't take turns to well and the physics seem off sometimes but the AI isn't all that swift and it seems players get better boosts off speed ramps.The power-up are odd things like lemon aid (oil slick+speed boost), marmalade (tar patch+speed boost), nails (road hazard), boots (speed boost), air spray (pushes everyone away from you), ?pretzels rolls or pigs in a blanket? (push back+speed boost), and milk (makes you big ?to help avoid hazards? it makes you flip easier though)You can unlock upto 16 characters, 10 tracks (night and day so 5x2), 10 car, and extras for the cars.In all there are 5 race modes and they are.Single racePlay 3 laps on any of the boards you have unlocked with ai racers.Time attackTry be beat a track within a time limit without power-ups (track speed boosters are still there).This is 1 lap and with no other racers.Collectors slalomHere you have 3 laps & a time limit to collect 80% of the stares on the track.You have a bar showing you how good your doing and once the yellow part if full you're done.Racing season Play 4 matches of 1 vs 1 racing the AI.This is set up like a 1on1 fighting bracket, where the winner moves on to the next until you have 1 winner.Floppy cupThis plays like a normal racing game, where after each race you get points depending on your placement.After a few races the player with the most points wins.There is also a local Co-opthis in split screen only.

												Cute small cart racer for beginners.There are 6 well-designed tracks (some have a night mode, most have a shortcut), some racing modes (single race with 4 difficulties, time trial, cone collecting, and two different tournament modes, respectively), no performance tuning, street features such as speedup arrows, a slow sand patch and a wet patch that wets your tires so that your next turn is harder to control. There are also a bunch of power-ups that speed you up or the others down (no weapons more violent than a box of thumbtacks, though). There's no story. All in all it's fairly varied.You get two keyboard setups and you can also use one Xbox controller, which unfortunately is also all you get for split-screen. I'm calling this a beginners game because the AI and the difficulty of the challenges are no match for more experienced players once you've gotten the hang of the game (do have a look at the help before you start).  Physics are a bit strange in that you get rubber on the road long before you can hear a tire squeal, and I turned the music off after a while, but all in all it handles predictably enough for cart game physics.I'm approximately halfway through the game, and to me it feels casual and I'm happy I didn't spend any money on it. But given the variety of race modes and tracks, it'd be a good game for a budding racing gamer - and that's precisely who it's aimed at. Recommended.			"

												This game is geared towards kids, but the handling is so difficult for kids that it really doesn't engage and/or entertain the audience that it is targetting.However, once I grabbed the controls what I found was a relatively easy to play racing game where even the pro league was not much of a threat to my winning first place.  The game from an adult perspective was too easy throughout, no matter what level you would compete against, and that the overall choices within the game were fairly limited.  I think there were only 10 tracks, 5 of which were night time versions of previous daytime tracks.  The variety of game modes is limited, but at least it gives a bit of extra bonus content compared to the track count issue.  I can't recommend this game because of the lack of child friendly controls and due to the lack of variety and difficulty when it comes to the AI and the other racers.			"

												I've got it as part of the 'Teddy's' bundle, and I was surprised to see a racer among the kids-friendly 'learning' point'n'clicks. It's good that rest of the bundle was ok for the price. - first and foremost, unlike the rest of the 'Floppy Ear' seiers IT'S NOT FOR KIDS. Unless your 6 years old one is a racing pro, familiar with all those physics, maneuvering and stuff. - responsivness with the gamepad is just awful. slightly less so with the keyboard, but it's not even mediocre.  - No controls customization. Zero. Tutorial? Had never heard about it. Buy hey! You can read the descriptions and layouts in the 'help' section of the 'main menu'. That's if you go there. Yay? - No volume controls.  It's sound\music on\off.  Or, probablby, this setting is damn good at hiding. Really? - The visuals in the other two games look so much better and smoother, models and sceneries alike.+ it has cards.Over-complicated for a 'kids' arcade racer, and definitely not good enough for an 'adult' racing sim. 'Wacky Wheels' is 20 years old, but it surpasses this piece of gaming software in so many ways.			"

Clunky Controls (a kid might even rage quit for that lol)3. If you go too fast and suddenly take a turn, you car will do a barrel roll4. Very limited graphics options5. You can't rebind your controls6. Does not tell any requirements on how to unlock other tracks and cars7. No indicator if you've already finished a trackI recommend the game if you're going to give this game to a kid because they won't even give a ♥♥♥♥ about the CONS, they just want to have fun. but for players that had been playing Mario Kart or Sonic All Stars, It could've been better.

												Pretty cute game, loved the characters and the old styled karts. But might be too difficult for kids. Even on easy mode, the opponents seems very raged sometimes, determined to pass you, make you spin and violently crash your kart which made me laugh. The controls are slippy and the graphics could be better (felt like a mobile game). Overall, I liked the idea of having a kart game where you have more complex controls than just accelerate and turn, it just needs to be more elaborated. Still, you can give a try because it's challenging. And cute.			"

												After struggling through a deep deppressed state of mind Teddy Floppy Ears is about to lose all hope.  He seeks a way to find happiness only to find out a racing cup is happening in his hometown of Ohio. He joins in with his friend Baconator. T.F.E. and Baconator are then asked to join the gang- ""Daddy plz"" Accepting they start the race. When the race begins they find a steep turn and if they miss it they will fly off it. Teddy makes it but sadly Baconaotr dosn't. T.F.G. then starts the second lap and falls to his death. T.F.G finally died like he wanted so it was k. So yes, I would reccomend it. 11/10			"

												A nice-looking Go Kart game with pretty okay handling and a few challenges; it doesn't necessarily mean that it's for kids only...Technically only 5 tracks; x2 = day & night = a bit too boring when fully completing the game. Even though there are plenty of Racing modes like Time Attack and Collector's Slalom, the game didn't fully grab my attention till the end due to the lack of variety. Maybe it was mostly due to the 30FPS cap; too slow gameplay.Previous doesn't mean I can't recommend this game. I still enjoyed most of the time I was racing, tuning, selecting new cars, reading stories about all the (Polish) cars etc.Would play again alone @ 60/75FPS or against family & friends @ a capped 30FPS.I'll never put milk in my car again 7.5/10Only game I've played so far where a tractor is the fastest and most stable vehicle ;D "

												Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race is a kart racing game in the universe of Teddy Floppy Ear. If you don't know Teddy Floppy Ear, you're like me, because I've never heard something of that until I bought this game, but Teddy Floppy Ear seems to be a thing in Poland. However, the whole story of the game is really simple. There are some animals on a farm and they have the great idea to do some kart racing. But who cares about the story in a racing game?You can choose between 5 different racing modes in the game. In the ""Single Race"" mode you do a standard racing game against opponents. In ""Time Attack"" you drive against the time. In ""Collectors Slalom"" you have to collect stars. In ""Racing Season"" you do a season, in ""Floppy Cup"" you drive a cup. Except in ""Time Attack"" and ""Collectors Slalom"" you can choose the difficulty level.And here's the first problem of the game: In all the different racing modes there are just 5 tracks. The 5 tracks are available in a day and night mode, but that don't change the fact that there are just 5 tracks and it's get really boring fast. And if that were not enough, you always have to do 3 rounds on every track to end the race, what really sucks when you do a cup or a season.What also really sucks is the sound of the game. There are just a few soundtracks and they repeat themselves over and over again. And the graphics is, hmmm, nothing really special, while the gameplay is slippery and the controls are wonky, but you get used to it if you play some time.But there are also some good facts. The characters and cars are made cute, so this game is kid friendly. You can also read some history facts about the cars. And while racing, in the most modes you can collect boosters and power ups, this makes the race a little more interesting.All in one, this game is definitely not a big title in the racing game genre. You will have some fun for a few hours and then you will never play it again. But if you involve the fact that this is a low price game made by a little developer team, it's okay to buy it. You can also get all achievements if you have the endurance to play this game for about 5 hours.Summary+day and night tracks+offline multiplayer+cute characters+historical cars+achievement progress+unlockables-just 5 racing tracks-tracks getting boring fast-wonky controller and gameplay-no online multiplayer-standard graphics-10 trading cards to get steam badge			"

												I arose from my hibernation to a pleasant, sunny spring day. Adorning my Floppy teddy ear, I set off for the raceway, my erect member firmly in hand. After entereing my ""Small Child"" ;), I proceeded to urinate on an intoxicated goat while a young school girl lactated on me, causing my ""Small Child"" to engorge into a ""Slightly Less Small Child"".  After coming in a solid 4th place, I acted in the only way I knew how. Bearpukku.

												It's cute, runs well, and is easy to play. A surprising amount of modes and unlockable vehicles and tracks, given the low price, although it seems like all the vehicles handle exactly the same. The only real downside is the music, which I found obnoxious, but kids might like it. Older children might get bored with it quickly, but young kids and adults looking for an adorable time waster can't go wrong at the price, especially if you can get the bundle on sale (currently $1.09 for all three Teddy Floppy Ear games). If you're expecting something with the depth and variety of Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, you're going to be disappointed, but again, consider the price. Even at full price, it's still incredibly cheap for what you get in entertainment value in return.			"

												Started the game and immediately chose my favorite character Blackie the badass dog.Once the race had started I realized someone had sabotaged my car. It went terribly slowthen turned into some rug-like shape. Quickly regained control over the situation again though and took over first place, where I stayed until the end of the race.Or so I thought...As soon as the winners podium was shown I witnessed some kinda fox celebrating my victory.An imposter?!Where did he come from?And more importantly:WHAT HAPPENED TO BLACKIE?!?!This game is one of the most messed up mystery games I've played in a long time.Still don't have a clue what's going on...I don't think children could solve this?

												I paid $.99 cents for this game and it is worlds better than the Hello Kitty racing game. Which is to say, it's not great, or even good, it's merely ok. Seriously, this is like someone's terrible drug fueled hallucination (off of store brand cough syrup). There are power ups like milk, lemonade and hot sauce. There are also tacks and I sometimes wonder if fudge is available. You can race as dog, other dog, kind of like a dog, possibly another dog that looks like a goat, some bird that may be a dog, and a couple of humans.The racing is standard but the ability to spin out and screw everything up adds a layer of strategy - that is don't race like garbage in this dumpster fire of a game. I like it, though, because I can race as a dog.			"

												This Masterpiece in gaming lacks a story, but makes up and oustounding gameplay and amzaing graphics. Not only is this game great to look at, its easy to run. A great starter game. It has local co-op so you can play it with your pals, the split-screen makes it great for parties and social gatherings. you can hook it up to the tv for hours of fun. The driving is realistic and cartoony enough to give you a unique racing experience. All together this game can go toe to toe with fallout 4, rainbow 6, or any other triple a title. In conclusion, this game cured my aids, which ment I didn't have to pay so much for my medical bills. so i quit my night job because i only worked there for the medical bills in the first place, giving me more time to play Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race.

The intro is a joke, the animations dont really work out at all, the ""characters"" don't move their mouth while speaking, its just sad to watch. The game itself features different game modes, single race, leagues, time races [...] which isnt that bad. But!The controls are not respsonsive at all, there is not tutorial or anything regarding the power ups, the physics do not work out, if you touch the wall you will slow down like you drove INTO IT....I don't know. The game is supposed to be for kids, but as someone who played old Mario Kart games when he was young, i do not see how this game could be even slightly appealing to my younger brothers.			"

												Honestly, Teddy Floppy Ear is a pretty neat game. It's appropriate for all ages, is fun, doesn't seem to be too repetitive, and is an overall nice game. I might even let my little sisters (7 yrs old) play it some time. I could definitely see this game in the smart-phone game market. I also LOVE the graphics in this game.On the bad side, for a Steam game, Teddy Floppy Ear over-dos it on the ""happy, yay, fun time"" factor. It also **HAS A GLITCH WHERE WHEN YOU SHIFT INTO REVERSE MODE, IT WON'T LET YOU STOP.** That might just be for mac users, (I use a mac) but it might be the reason why this game isn't so popular.If you are a perspective parent, I would recommend this game for all ages 7+. If you are a perspective gamer, I would recommend this game for people who want a casual game to play for a few months, and people who just want to have fun.Im not making a conclusion paragraph, because i'm too lazy, and it's 10:30 at night!!! (not that anyone actualy cares about writing proper video game reviews on Steam)			"

Teddy Floppy Ears - The Race can't stand against more well known cart racers. It's graphics and characters are fairly generic, the soundtrack and gameplay are forgettable. This is not a game for adults though, so it's simplicity and low difficulty can be forgiven. Despite it's shortcomings, ""The Race"" is still a tight little game for $5. The backgrounds of the races, for example, show a care and attention to some smaller details by Forever Entertainment. There are some minor issues with the physics of the carts, causing them to tip. My main frustration was with the weapons though, which are almost completely ineffective and pointless. I wish they'd paid more attention here. Offering a fair number of unlockables, a kid could easily burn through a few afternoons playing it.PROS-decent graphics-fairly bug free-decent unlockablesCONS-forgettable design-ineffective weapons-simplistic gameplayDISCLAIMER: Review is based upon approx 1 hour of gameplay.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a probaly not a racing game.Interface/Menu/SettingsWeird intro.You can Toggle off the Music Volume.You can Toggle off the Sound Volume.There are some Resolution sizes.Able to play with a controller.Has Local Race.About the game.You are playing an animal behind a car. You are racing against other computers. The first thing that you will noticed in the game. Will be the controls. The controls are poorly done and could have a hard time to keep them under your control. Furthermore your car is able to \""Flip\"" over when making a curve. Which will only slow you even more down. There are some power-ups but there are not really a big difference between those and there are only 5 of those. On the road you will see an arrow. Once you are driving over this, You will gain a small boost. The computer players are pretty unfair and difficult. On the other hand they are also pretty buggy. If you have managed to use a powerup and they drive against something. They will get stuck for a small period of time. But this is usually enough to have huge lead.The controls and steering are extremely bad and wonky. (Even worse on a controller)Power-ups only for dropping behind you. Nothing to gain boost.No Car customization, only Pre-set.No Tutorials only a help.Music is alright.Graphics are alright.Computer have Good steering and controls and also able to drive a bit faster than you.Has some different game modesOther things.This is truly a game for kids.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10 "

												Sunday 29th November 2015 12.59 am -This is by far my favourite game of all time merely before Teddy Floppy Ear - Kayaking and Teddy Floppy Ear - Mountain Adventure. I would recommend this game to everyone, all of my friends must play this, it was in the autumn sale so after i finish writing this review i shall go off and purchase this and all of the other games for each and everyone, and so should you. If you are into F1 games or Mario Kart or any similar titles you should definitely purchase this game for it shall blow your mind with the glory of its gameplay, graphics and multiple and very intricate settings options. i absolutely adore this game and so will you if you spare £7.99 for this bundle of amazingness and dedicate merely 30 minutes of your time. I will be shortly nominating this game for The Game Of The Year Award 2015, i strongly advise you all to do the same so we can immerse ourselves yet again in another heart melting adventure with the comforting, lovable, ball of fuzz which is Teddy Floppy Ear himself.This game comes with multiple features such as, and not limited to local multiplayer, full controller support (even for non brand controllers), steam cloud storage, this will allow for no space to be taken on your computer other than the initial installation. I have heard in previous comments and posts that the driving is slippery and difficult to control, this is merely due to the fact the game is presumed to be aimed towards an older audience (8-10) in my opinion this allows for the older children to feel more engaged as they have more of a challenge to face in the game. unlike the other Teddy Floppy Ear titles this game adds a far more challenging side to the series, this really stood out to me as a PC gamer as it allows for more character to flow through the series of games ranging from an easy laidback vibe in the first two games to a more front heavy vibe to the third.Monday 15th February 2016 10:10pm  -However, in my time playing along with my good friend Po, we came across a slight and minor discrepancy which was the fact even though Po's time was 1.35 and the bot Hare's time was 1.29, Po placed in front of Hare. This aroused a slight confusion between Po and myself. Despite this small problem, it was an extremely enjoyable experience and Po and I shall be returning to the game very promptly.			"

												This game may seem like a Mario Kart or Sonic All Stars Racing ripoff, but it's actually worse. The game lacks content, only offering 5 tracks. The cars feel the same, and the various modes are just slight variations of a race. They could at least add the 5 tracks but reversed, but instead we have the same 5 tracks but at night. There's 4 difficulty settings, but the game isn't really hard. The graphics are crap but the biggest offender is that this racing game is locked at 30 FPS. So, the game feels not only repetitive but also slow paced. However, i'm gonna give a discount here because this is a game aimed for kids, and the core gameplay actually works. Some may not like it, but i was surprised. The driving mechanics actually work and the game is completely playable. For kids and for cheap, i can recommend it.

But like a few others mentioned you need more skill  and the cars drivt and slide away and you have to use the brake. However this game is ridiculously easy for me as a veteran in the racing genre and there is no challenge at all not even at the highest difficulty.

												Completely unlike the other Floppy Ears games, this one has zero story. It's purely a racing game. And a mediocre one.It's somewhat kid friendly, as you can choose easy difficulty and the characters are familiar. The steering however it quite difficult. I compare this to other racing games and it can't hold up. Even on normal difficulty (the second easiest out of 4) an experienced adult will get a very serious challenge. The power-ups are not exactly what the game leads you to believe. Some powerups simply do something else than stated. The graphics are acceptable but hard to enjoy when your car suddenly goes flying for little or no reason, or when enemies simply stand still because of poor programming. Can not recommend. There are better racing games, better family themed games, prettier games, and better Floppy Ears games.			"

												Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race, though it may seem like a forgettable driving game at first glance, proves to be so much more upon the second, third and the infinity glance. The lore of ""THE RACE"" starts off with the evil snot-faced piggie organizing a series of races, through dastardly driving cars, that handle badly. This is all obviously a big ploy by the pig, the really bad handling cars to screw up our fun, and Teddy's and his friends. But we'll show that pig! We'll race to our heart's content, and enjoy it!Tiny theory here, though we may not get the reveal till part 2 of the race, i imagine so far that pig is actually a horrible sith space lizard lord, abandoned by his parents and thrown into the cruel laws of this unforgiving world. How did his parents leave him, may you ask? Well, they died from a car accident. From here on out, the pig decides that he'll make quote-unquote friends suffer the same horrible mistake, the terrifying thought that you drove over someone, never forgiving yourself for that one unfateful day. But of course, that's just a theory. MY theory. Anyway, to get back on track, the game consists of many wacky game modes, with some of the most enriched and well written characters. There's Teddy, the nicest guy around, thanks to his French uncle, who raised him for over 50 years. It demonstrates that Teddy's one of those dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people that refuse to grow up, and face the dangers of real life, instead going into racing and other fun shenanigans while his French uncle fights with him every day he comes back to his house. But Teddy refuses to see things the adult way. He's a kid, and he always will be.One of my favorites personally, is Hedgehog. Always a failure in life, he never gets things his way. He just wants to be first, but he ends up last. His life is tormented, Satanized you might say. Hell follows him, the demons stab him when he's not looking, twisting the knife back and forward, as he sheds endless tears. His mom is never there for him, never supports him, though he tries to take comfort in some fact Teddy's there for him, though he secretly believes Teddy actually hates him and wants him to die. He drowns in sorrows in Jack Daniels booze everyday at the Hedgy's Edgy Bar.Those are some examples of the characters. by the way ladies if you're free i'm avaible call me just friend invite me and we can sort things out hush hush y'knowwhatmsayin' ;)Rated 18+ and up, The Race offers some of the most heart wrenching backstories ever, hidden behind a colorful, cheery setting, very much like Undertale. Highly recommended for any Canadian.			"

												looks pretty nice, charming and all that but I was misled by other reviews here that said this was difficult due to being like a realistic racing game in physics terms but with kart racing graphics and gimmicks - this is not the case!there actually isn't a way to properly hone skills and get really good because the physics are totally unpredictable. applying brakes on tight turns makes you abruptly slow if you make it register at all but the CPU players have no apparent slow down on the corners and releasing acceleration in advance also yields unsatisfactory results then if you manage a big turn on a bend that doesn't need braking the car starts flipping around unpredictably (yes actual flipping) but rather than being reset you can manually press a button to lower a reset car back onto the same spot on the road  - if you didn't know this you'd be bouncing around for a while.Its unclear what the weapons do and what their range is, all I know is they keep not hitting my opponents or some fire will come out of my car and I'm unsure if I dropped the fire behind me or got a speed boost ( thats how weird the physics and acceleration can be)I want to like this game so I hope the devs do a couple of things.*make power sliding work well*make the powerups and weapons do something obvious *smooth the physics out, no more flipping kartsin the meantime, don't buy this for a kid - I rage quit on easy ! good luck devs, you have a charmingly presented game on your hands, it needs some major fixes though			"

												Interesting Kart Racer based on the kid friendly ""Teddy Floppy Ear"" IP but it falls flat with it's target audience. The car handling is absolutely terrible and younger gamers will get frustrated pretty quickly. I enjoy all types of racing games but even on the easiest level I was struggling with the races. And the actual control setup is hidden somewhere (I haven't found it yet but someone pointed it out in another review) and you can't rebind the controls. The fact that the controls can't be rebound baffles the mind in a game aimed towards younger gamers. Ever see a 4 or 5 year old try to control a racer with the an Xbox 360 controller? Being able to bind all the controls to the face buttons would've been a nice addition. Luckily I got this as part of a Teddy Floppy Ear bundle that cost a few bucks so I don't really feel upset. But I am disappointed in the game nonetheless.			"

												I highly enjoyed this immersive experience granted to me by my dad. It was a gud game that I liked a lot . Some people may not enjoy it because it requirs a highly expierenced mind that not everyone has. I do how ever say if you have the mental capacity to enjoy a game that is up there with art like the sistine chapel and Leonardo's Mona Lisa, then you will enjoy this. If you are looking to expand your mind from the impearlist lies and propaganda pushed by the far left media like CNN. In fact CNN is freaking stoopid. Sorry excuse my language for I have a high distaste for the dum  dum media outlets like them. like dum dum give me gum gum. SHUT UP CNN YOU ARE LYING ABOUT HILARY CLINTOIN.

												I have been playing video games for almost the full time I have been alive, owned more consoles than years I have been alive, and invested more time into gaming in general than any other activity in my life.With all this noted, I can safely say that Teddy Floopy Ear - The Race is the best game I have ever played.The character development in this game is truly outstanding, and the story is both inspiring and breathtaking at times, you will feel every emotion you have even known plus more; joy, sadness, anger, regret, fear, shock, surprise, disgust and true love. Decisions have consequences and you need to take your time as well as make quick decisions. After a some time you start to feel for your characters and develop various bonds with them; you rely on them for various tasks and you will start to worry taking them into more dangerous areas. Personally, I have never felt such a true bond with any person, living or dead, as I have with the characters in Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race. When you lose a race, you will feel you have personally failed your friends; I have broken down right in front of my PC due to this more times than I can remember.The roleplaying in this game is truly intense, and the replayibility is on another level. Games like the Witcher 3, Skyrim or any other mid-tier game have nothing on the time you will spend in this. As a great man once said, 'Easy to pick up, hard to master'. That man was Teddy Floppy Ear.The over-the-top graphical power of this game may be hard for some players to handle, as the photo realism of the vast green plains, glowing sunsets and life-like characters may scare you with its beauty. Yet, the optimisation is years ahead of its time, and the game will run beautifully on almost any PC. The developers of this game are true geniuses.This is by far the greatest soundtrack in any game ever, the compisitions left me in true awe and the only things even comparable to the sounds that will fill your ears are The Beatles' Sgt. Peppers Lonley Hearts Club Band; Mozart's Symphony No 41, ‘Jupiter’; or the sound of a child being brought into this cruel, cold and unforgiving world. Note that these works sound like fingernails on a blackboard compared to what you will experience in Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race.This is by far the best money I have ever spent. I urge you with all my heart and all my soul to play this masterpiece. 11/10. Game of the millenium.(Note I have over 6,000 hours in this game in offline mode, as I would frequently have to shut myself out from notifications due to the emotional trauma and/or euphoria I experienced so frequently in Teddy Floopy Ear - The Race.)Thank you for reading.

												An excellent game that provided me hours of fun (adult). This game has pleasant aesthetics, does not suffer from major bugs, and provides a little bit of challenge to complete the races. The controls are slippery, but not the bad kind of slippery; it is part of the game to be able to master it (which only takes 2-3 races).Here are some bugs I've noticed:- AI only moves forward, so sometimes they get trapped and you need to bump into them so that they can go back to the race.- AI doesn't usually take the shortcuts (only when forced, by bumping into them), but they should on expert difficulty.- The middle of the city stage has a problem on the rank system, so even if you are half a lap in front of everybody you will keep changing positions with everybody until you are out of the buggy zone.- Twice I was racing (I think it was on the last stage) and one of the enemies got stuck out of stage (one of these times I was smashed, and the one who smashed me ran over me and ended up outside of stage). They wouldn't come back.Improvement points:- Add online multiplayer- Add manual drift- Add more stages; it gets boring to play the same thing over and over.- I'd always avoid the milk bottles, as they are almost always a problem than a solution; when you hit someone you smash them, but you usually get thrown somewhere else, or even flip over, making every other player pass you. Maybe they should be removed or improved somehow?Anyway, awesome game, and I'm looking forward to the Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race 2.Note: Put the Diddy Kong Racing OST on the background and have fun.

												★★★★★★☆☆☆☆I'm not sure what was the target audience for that game. In general it's nice racing game with simple but decent physics, a few game modes (single race, tournament etc.), quite many cars and nicely diverse routes (lakes, mountains, towns, night races etc.). Graphics, sounds and music are also fine. There is only one little problem - the game is much too hard to be played by 3-4 years old kids, which, I supposed, were target audience for ""Teddy Floppy Ear..."" games. The difficulty level  cannot be adjusted here (i.e. there are some options, indeed, but the differences between levels are almost unnoticable).			"

												- the good -It's a fun little racer. The handling doesn't feel as crisp as other, more well-known kart racing games. But it kind of adds to the charm and makes every kart game unique.The game tries to remain interesting by unlocking some new cars and car upgrades (visual only, I think). But there isn't anything more than that.- the bad -While there are several modes, such as a tournament knock-out mode, league, time trial and single race, there are very few tracks to play those modes on. The time I spent (4 hours at the time of writing this review), is all the time needed to get all achievements for this game. You can probably do it in less, especially if you don't care for the trading cards.- the ugly -As I said, handling can be a little bit awkward, but is manageable. But physics can be really painful sometimes. When you are going to fast cars will start wobbling. When you are making a turn you have the chance of toppling over. I don't know if this is intentional or just a problem with the physics configuration, but it feels cheap and annoying.- the verdict -If any of these characters have some nostalgic meaning to them, go for it. If you are looking for a fun kart game I recommend to look elsewhere. I definitely recommend SuperTuxKart if you haven't already ;)			"

												Well, what should I say. I bought this time after I read some of the reviews and then looked at other games on sale. I came across other Teddy Floppy Ear games and I said asked if this racing game was a  joke. Other people that bought this game got suckered in and then posted good reviews because they didn't want to be the only people that bought the game.  I played the game myself  and thought this is O.K. Then played with my son and daugher using Xbox 360 controllers. We did have fun. It is not an easy game to play.  Not for small children unless you like seeing your kids cry.  Or you crying as your kids beat you.  If you are looking for a Nintendo Mario racing game this is not it. If you want a fun quick game and pay a dollar (or less on sale) , this may fit the bill.  I haven't unlocked any of the extra cars or tracks but I can't wait to see what added bonuses will be unlocked. I wish more than two players could play. Four people would be a blast.Get over the title (or smile at it) and play the game.			"

												This game is obviously an attempt to create a mario kart clone. So far so good: Characters & Maps are quite fine and playable and the handling with controller is also not bad. Huge problem in this game is the big lack of action and tension. There are several pick-ups, just as known in Mario Kart, but these are only effecting enemies right next to you. There is not even one pick-up that is able to cause any damage in a distance, which means, if you are the last or way behind the player before you, you have no chance to slow him down, exept pure racing skills (and eventually nitro). This issue makes the game completely boring and pointless, because all the pick-ups are basically worthless. For the price it might be okay for sure, especially for kids. But all in all there is nothing motivating in playing this game, even unlocking all achievements was mostly pure boredom cause everything was repeating itself. You may try it, but for me the thumb goes slightly down. 4/10 Good luck! :D			"

												On the main menu, Teddy Floppy Ear looks like he's ready for a black ops mission.Anyway, Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race is a very watered down version of Mario Kart.While it's fairly obvious this is a children's game, it was still enjoyable and challenging. Then again, I don't play a lot of racing games, so my standards are kinda low when it comes to this genre.Now, the controls are not very fluid, and your turning ability isn't that great. At least when you start. This is probably where a lot of the challenge is going to arise from, because you have to learn how to deal with such clunky turning. But once you have the hang of things, you get sort of better. And once you've stayed first for a while, the rest of the track is a bit of a cruise, assuming you can maintain your performance at a consistent level.As you complete cups and challenges and such, you can earn new gear to add to your cars. I'm not sure if these have any significant impact on your car's performance, or if I'm just getting better at the game. But personally, I do like to think they do something.Much like Mario Kart, you can pick characters and cars to use to race with. Bear in mind that the cars are inspired mostly from Polish motor vehicles from the 1950's to the late 1990's. I would assume this is the case because Teddy Floppy Ear or more accurately, Miś Uszatek was a kids show in Poland around the 1970's time period. Now, I'm not sure if the cars vary in performance since there aren't any 'statistics' for each vehicle, but the Polonez has worked well for me. Characters are (probably) based off the kids show as well, but you can also recall some of them from the other Teddy Floppy Ear games on Steam. Again, the game doesn't tell you anything about the characters except the name and their appearance.The game modes are also fairly standard. Generic races, 1-lap time trials, 1v1 race tourney, collect-the-things-on-the-track races. Nothing overly new, but I think the challenge is emphasised more in the maps the game gives you.While the majority of the maps are manageable with the horrendous steering, track obstacles and other racers, they do give you sharp turns every here and now, and if you're not familiar with the map, it can be a real struggle to get by without crashing into a wall. So speed management and makeshift drifting (i.e. turning while braking or slowing down) is very handy to learn.On the subject of maps, the game also has night levels, which are essentially reskins of the regular levels with a darker backdrop and lights in certain places of the circuit. While this does make the map more challenging especially when you try to use the map shortcuts, it's still sort of easy if you already have an idea about the general layout of its daytime counterpart.Like most racing games these days, there are powerups you can use to give yourself a buff. Apparently, I only found at once I finished the game that the Help section on the main menu literally gives you all the information on controls and powerups. These powerups can be picked up by crashing into them, and override anything you're already currently holding.Surprisingly, since the powerups are not randomised much, you can more or less get any powerup whether you're first, middle or last. You'll also find that there aren't any of those rage-inducing hit-the-first-ranked-player projectiles or homing Red Shells, so I do enjoy not being wrecked by a horde of vengeful AI bots. And there aren't that many powerups to use, but each has its own purpose:Lemonade / Chilli (or Brown?) Sauce: Gives you a boost to 60km/h and lays down a puddle of liquid for other racers to slip on (note that I've never been in a situation where I've slipped in my own traps, so I'm not sure if it's possible). This powerup is useful for speed recovery after a crash.Wellington Boots: Basically just a speed boost. Air Horn / Pigs in Blankets: Produces a shockwave that pushes nearby enemies. Good for early game progress, or when your competition is getting close.Tacks: Sets down a trap for enemies. Probably the least useful powerup.Milk: Make you big, so you can drive faster and crush little tiny baby racers into pancakes. Well, not actual pancakes but you make them flat and slower, similar to the Mega Mushroom powerup in Mario Kart. However, you are more prone to flipping if you steer too sharply.Additionally, the AI is somewhat questionable at times. In most cases, they just drive normally and steer almost as badly as you do. Sometimes they get stuck on walls, and don't seem to recover very well. Usually, this is the case when they're turning and then they crash into a curved wall or they try and use a shortcut but enter in awkwardly. While this is good for you as the player since it makes your job of winning easier, for... reasons, the ranking can get a bit weird at these times. I remember when I was in a 1v1 race with an AI bot, and they got stuck on a wall. Then they were suddenly coming 1st, even though I was practically ahead by half a lap. Soon after, more switching between ranks and then it stabilises back to normal, which at this point the AI bot might have gotten back on track.Lastly, there are achievements and cards. If you can become sufficiently adept at the game, the achievements are easy enough. Sometimes I got achievements for half-completing some of the objectives. As for the cards, they are fairly cheap, and if you're like me, you just let the game run idly to get those last few cards because you finished the game and achievements in under 5 hours.In summary, I'll give Teddy Floppy Ear - The Race a good ol' 6.5 / 10. Very casual stuff, and good practice for things like TrackMania. Could brush up on the AI getting stuck on walls and explanations for whether characters and car enhancements actually do anything.

Picking from cute little animals makes it a cute game.  However, it just wasn't that interesting or egaging like a Mario Kart game.  I stopped simply because I have games that are more fun to play.  (3/5 stars, also has trading cards).			"

												I would give this a better review but as it stands it is almost immpossible to play. In the menu's it acts as thow an arrow key or a controler firection is being heald down so that it just scrolls through the menus on it's own very quickly. So i have to try and hit the button to select something as it flies by. Once to the actual race the problem goes away. I play several games and this is the only one that does that. PLEASE FIX!! I emailed the dev so i will update this if it grts fixed. Seems like a great game, i play a lot of local coop with my 9 year old daughter and this game would be perfect but it is to hard to do anything.			"

												Best game on steam, you think you know a true gaming experience? STOP! You have not lived until you have played this master piece, every detail is pixel perfect, character selection absolutely amazing a wide selection of a variety of sexy scrumptious farm animals. The vehicles and customization, simply beautiful towards the human eye, hours of fun and such an amazing game I am going to have so much fun with Miss Piggy and my FIAT for the rest of my days. I am truly regretful of not buying the FLOPPY TEDDY EAR BUNDLE PACK I am sure it would be the most fun but I am finacially unstable so will not be purchasing the bundle unfortunately. A truly wonderful game 10/10 would play again. <3 <3 <3 <3			"

												It is a Go Kart racer with unlockable tracks and characters. There are powerups to speed you up or disable opponents.There are a lot of characters to play. I enjoyed playing the Traffic Warden and Hedgehog. I like Beaver.There is only local multiplayer, which is unfortunate. So, for example, if you like Beaver and your friend likes Aunt, it is unlikely that you will see Aunt Beaver unless you get the same people in the room together; in multiplayer. If there was online multiplayer, you could have all the Aunt Beaver matchups you would like.It takes so long to get the cards that I wish I was playing Garfield Kart.Very good price to get in the bundle on sale with Kayaking and Mountain Adventure (which both have less cards that drop faster).

												(Review writed with 10 hour gaming and all achievements unlocked - Dec 13th, 2016).It looks like a Mario Kart with a children’s storybook art style. Teddy Floppy Ear’s – The Race is a single player or two players with local split screen racing game with European inspired old vehicles. It's a limited race game but its what you get for buying a kids game.Pros: 	- Looks great for a kids race game;        	- Catching race musics;         	- Nice race tracks.Cons:	- No kart stats;                - No pilots stats;	        - No challenging I.A.;         	- Few weapons to choose;        	- Few Racetracks.7,5/10.

												Vamos lá, quando joguei esse game, achei que seria mais um jogo linear de corrida, apos alguns minutos de gameplay posso dizer que é um ótimo jogo, me lembra bem Mario Kart 64 e Crash Team Racing, porem com uma fisica aperfeiçoada. Tem otimas texturas e boa ambientação, o menu é surpreendente em todos aspectos, a musica de fundo ficou bem com a proposta do game. Tem um bom singleplayer com uma dificuldade até que alta, alem de uma variedade de power ups, o que melhora a experiencia de jogo. Tem alguns personagens selecionaveis e uma variedade mediana de karts que pelo que notei, são inspirados em carros reais, lembrando que há karts a serem desbloqueados.As pistas são bem ambientadas e alem dos power ups, existem alguns obstaculos, como cones, agua e até mesmo areia, alem de uma ""plataforma"" que se você passar por ela, sua velocidade aumenta. É importante lembrar que tambem há pistas a serem desbloqueadas no singleplayer.Nota do game 9/10Prós: Ótima jogabilidade, Gráficos bons, Diversão proporcionada, Dá pra amassar os carros como uma panqueca ""atropelando"" haha.Contras: A camera do veiculo poderia ser mais próxima. Peca um pouco nos efeitos de iluminação (A cor verde do mapa devia ser mais realçada, e não escura). "

												The controls are a bit tricky at firts but once you've learned to adjust it is one of the best racing games you will ever play. The world art is so increadibly maticulate I almost wanna play this on VR and just fly around the map looking at everying its so beautiful! I also think its Hillarious that it only comes in two languages, Polish and English. The only thing that would make this game better is if there were an Online Multiplayer mode in either public loby, private games with friends, or both. Aside from that there isn't a single thing I would change. I am happy with my purchase and look forward to buying this for my friends if and when online features become presnt.			"

Am I that bad at racing games or is this one made to ♥♥♥♥ me off? If it's more frustrating than fun, then.... I can't leave a positive rating.

												It cost me 49 cents and it is an amusing little game.The other reviews are correct, the driving isn't always easy, and the graphics are for children - so it kind of misses the boat on both counts. Driving for the more experienced and graphics for kids.With that said, for 49 cents it gave me a few hours of fun and it was better than I expected, for the price it was worth it,			"
