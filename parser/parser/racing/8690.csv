												STCC includes a number of Skandinavian tracks and both FWD and RWD touring cars that allow for some close racing.At this price level I'd pick up the STCC expansion and STCC 2 DLC.Race '07 is great, if you like racing on the PC it is a must have - even in 2014!It may not have the latest graphics, but with a little tuning it looks like good simulator with crisp functional graphics.Certainly one of my favorite racing games.
