												A ""pure"" game, like tetris. Waveform is easy to understand, but difficult to master. While playing, I'm continuously surprised at how well the core mechanic of modifying the frequency and amplitude of a sine wave to collect points actually works. Awesome job, I love to see nicely done new mechanics like this.			"

One of those indie games with dozens of levels and simple game mechanics. You change wave length and frequency that ship will follow. The goal is to avoid obstacles while catching as many plasma as possible. I don't know why, but it's quite fun for first hour... "

												You know those games with ridiculusly simple play style that yet still seem to be soo hard.... you have found one!Nice graphics to watch.Cool pleasing music and sound effects.Simply the play sytle is this .. adjust the wave length, height, and speed with a tuging hold from your mouse. Aim for the sweet spots, avoid obsticles, and try not to be distracted. Simple yet super challenging. A cool game for all ages that I'd even break out at a party. Really fun frustration....you should buy this!			"

												Waveform tasks you with controlling a wave of light through a galaxy of planets. The goal is reaching the Sun from Pluto, a journey which traverses over 100 levels through 11 different worlds. As further levels are reached, the goal of reaching the Sun expands into stopping a singularity that threatens to darken the entire galaxy. More elements of the story are revealed in later levels.The concept of controlling a wave of light is executed flawlessly through beautifully rendered levels and a challenging, but addictive gameplay experience. If you are looking for a truly unique and innovative experience you shouldn’t hesitate to add Waveform to your game library.Overall verdict: Highly recommended!			"

												I'm extremely surprised to see that Waveform isn't more popular. It has to be one of the most original Action-Puzzler released those past few years. This is truthfully one of the craziest indie game I've played in a long time, with a gameplay that is so simple but yet so addictive! To put it short, you control a sinusoidal wave with your mouse, modifying its lenght and height as it suits you to catch all the coloured circles scattered around. The content is massive, more than a 100 levels for the campaign, and as much in the challenge mode.  Waveform will suit any kind of gamer, casual or hardcore. A bottle of aspirin is highly required if you aim to 100% complete every single level available !There's even a survival mode with leaderboards, just in case you want to prove you're a better wave rider than the rest of the world.Also, thumbs up for the best ending level in the history of Wavelenght gaming. I strongly recommend this game! Totally worth its full price. I noticed you could now get it for 0,19€ only during sales. That's almost a steal! Do yourself a favour and add this game to your library now !			"

												A simple puzzle game where you manipulate your trajectory by moving the mouse in all directions, to control the wave form you travel across.Along the track you have to pick up bonuses and avoid mines, and at times have to perfectly follow a given path.You are constantly adjusting the path in order to keep things going, and things quickly become more and more difficult.Overall a well made and challenging puzzle game.

												Waveform is very relaxing, but still a real challenge. Fresh mechanics throughout the levels keeps the gameplay varied. Each level looks great, and rewards you for performing well. Finishing levels isn't so much of a challenge, but doing well enough to unlock a star level, or hit a black hole, provides enough incentive to play levels again. Overall a very great, peaceful yet challenging game. Definitely worth the price.			"

												Waveform seems simple enough, but this game is tough. You control the amplitude and wavelength of an orb to run through a gauntlet of space objects. The control aspect is quite intuitive with a mouse, but getting the waveform to follow just the right path is more than tricky--it's downright difficult.What I didn't realize after completing Pluto is that there are many other planets to be completed. The interface didn't exactly make it obvious (to me at least) that you can scroll through these other planets. With the amount of content this game has to offer, it really is an excellent value for puzzle gamers--just be prepared for frustration.			"

												Very fun, addictive and easy to get into. It's not TOO EASY either, in fact....I find it rather hard at times. It has made me rage several times, and yet I still come back.The controls are very simple and the screen itself doesn't fill up with too much information for you at once.The concept involving waves of light is done very precise and the sensitivity of the mouse can be edited to whatever degree you want to have it at.The 'story' takes you through the solar system and the background settings and effects are in great detail! It's a pretty game overall, I found myself staring at the background as I died a few times. haha..The music is very nice in this game as well! Nice balance of bass and tunes~(That's saying a lot as I tend to listen to my own music while games are muted)The music is each stage is different and the rate that they play in depends on how you play the level.Replay value, at least for me is very high.

												This is a pretty damn fun puzzle game with a very simple concept that scales appropriately in difficulty over time. Admittedly some of the features introduced can be quite obnoxious (particularly wormholes) but it's a genuinely enjoyable challenge of skill and timing.Then you get to the last set of planets and are immediately gated by obnoxious requirements. You see, at each level you are scored a percentage, which awards you a number of stars rounded down to the lowest ten e.g. 79% = 7 stars! Can you see where this is going? Waveform ultimately turns into an obnoxiously grind-fest wherein you're playing the same level over and over to scrap an extra few points out to potentially have enough stars to unlock another level or two. This star requirement is present throughout the game but it really ramps up towards the end.Honestly it's quite a fun game, but I can't imagine actually finishing it. Probably the perfect tablet game for killing time as you gather those last few stars at a glacial pace over the course of a few weeks. Not worth buying on Steam unfortunately.			"

 About WaveformWaveform is a perfect example of a unique idea done right. The gameplay is executed flawlessly, the style is unique, and there is certainly plenty of meat to the game. The only real downfall is that it seems to be undedicated to a single audience; it seems to be and plays somewhat like a puzzle game yet is at times extremely fast-paced and incredibly difficult, two things which are generally not seen together. For what it does, Waveform is an amazing game, and one that many hours could be poured into. Release Date: 20 Mar, 2012	 The GameplayThe first hurdle newcomers to the game will encounter is the gameplay mechanics. Not because they're flawed and unplayable, but because they're different than anything else you've likely played before, meaning it can take an hour or two of trial and error to truly understand how to use it. It's honestly easier to see in Waveform's trailer than it is to explain, but to sum it up: You control a wavy line of light, and the only thing you can't do with it is slow it down. Your goal is to collect orbs and waves while avoiding various obstacles and using the environment to your advantage to change your path or the objects around you.The GamemodeThe second thing that will likely be offputting is the game's difficulty. Expect to have to repeat levels and sections of levels multiple times in order to simply pass the level, especially if it's a level that requires (near-)perfection in a certain section in order to succeed. When you finally do succeed, don't be surprised to receive a rating of 30%, either, as the game is quite stingy with its ratings, requiring practically flawless runs of an entire level to get the full 10-star 100% rating. Luckily, the game does have checkpoints and levels generally aren't terribly long, plus you don't need anywhere near the max number of stars to access the levels you need them to unlock. Still, you're likely to end up frustrated at times with Waveform, especially if you're the completionist type.The Sound Other than those potential issues and some others like repetitive audio, Waveform is a great game. It's very chill for the most part, unless you're going for 100% in every level or run into a difficult level or section. There are little bits of story after some levels that, while not exactly Mass Effect-level engrossing, are intriguing. Despite the difficulty, there will be few places where it feels like the mistakes you make are the fault of the game. You won't be able to find a game elsewhere like it, and it does what it does well, thus Waveform gets a strong recommend from me.All in All  Waveform is a good Indie Game8/10 From Me Sweep "

												There's a fix for the crash:Try changing ""UseShaders"" to ""False"" in the config.ini file.You can find that file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Waveform\configOriginal review:---Common crashes on Uranus' first level. Can't progress - do not buy until they fix this mess.Great game otherwise, requiring constant attention (although can be tiring) and good reflexes. Control is easy, but dragging your mouse to lengthen, shorten, widen the wave to avoid obstacles. Graphic is good, doesn't hurt my fragile eyes by not providing junk looking pixels.DLC is overpriced one, though. One measly level for a dollar. And it's just a single level not multi-layered level.			"

												+Very unusual gameplay+Soundtrack, very chilling and nice+The pricepoint is really DIVINE, other game publishers should learn from this example !+Graphics is also great and it works visually to complete the experience and its radical idea.You cant move, because you are a wave. But instead you can shapeshift indefinitely being a sinewave, you also have to... And you conquer the obsticles and hit powerups, wormholes and items.The controls are a bit unpredictable by every measurement.Instead you start to see the result, and you begin to match with the result every time.In most games, you have some feedback of some sort about your location.It took some plays to get used to being a wave.But when that was done, you will control its form and navigate through the solar system to travel in time with a lot of visualization.-I hate being a wave.11/10			"

												Waveform is an odd one.You don't move your ship-dot-thing. You move its path.And its path, as the name implies, is a waveform.Vertical mouse dragging causes the trough and valley of the wave to change, horozontally dragging changes the steepness of the line.This is very hard to control, but in this case, that's a good thing. The controls work. They're not jerky, they're not too fast or too slow, every mistake is your own. But unlike in some other games, I feel an incentive to learn and adjust to the system.It also looks pretty large as well. The first planet has 8 levels, so I'd assume that's standard and there are 9 planets. So you get 72 levels with the game, and if you feel like getting the DLC (which I did, simply because it was also on sale and $0.14 at the time I bought it), you get about 8 more.Even when you're done with the levels there's still a high score board to work at. Upon clearing a planet you unlock an unlimited mode for it. I'm not sure what the difference between Pluto unlimited and Mercury unlimited is, but if I were to guess I'd say each planet has slightly different mechanics.All in all I think this could be one of those weird little gems with a bit more work put into it. For less than a dollar though, I definitely recommend it. For that price you'd get 4 runs at it in an arcade, but here you're getting full access.			"

												Waveform is an imaginary line representing all parts of a wave where particles are vibrating in the same phase and have the same distance from the source. Waveform is related to speed, wavelength and frequency . - Wave speed (v) = Distance traveled by a wave per unit of time.- Wavelength (λ) = The distance between two consecutive points which are in phase.- Frequency (ƒ) = The number of complete oscillations made in one second.Where:-Speed = Frequency (ƒ) x Wavelength (λ)v= ƒλThe higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength. At constant speed, when the frequency increase, the wavelength will decrease.In this game, you have to modify the wavelength and amplitude and guide the particle to collect light orbs in order to score points. Thus, you're playing a Displacement-Distance (s-d) graph game. Where amplitude (a) and wavelength (λ) will be playing as the main role of the game.The bigger the amplitude, the shorter the wavelength, the faster the particle will travel throughout the wave.Vice versa, the larger the wavelength, the smaller the amplitude, the slower the particle will travel throughout the wave.Basically this concept is easy to understand with this Waveform Simulator, however to modify the wavelength while the particle is traveling at super speed will be tough and challenging for some players to master this game.I love Physics, that's why I bought this game.

												If you're a serios gamer or a competitive one, you can't miss this experience.It's a very simple game that is very (!!) hard to master.Get past the first hour, and you're hooked.It's all about moving your mouse (no buttons!) to perfect the waveform in order to collect stuff.More and more aspects build the game from level to level, keeping it interesting and totally immersive.The game is loooooooong. About 100 levels.Even after you finish (I haven't yet) all the levels (or before), you can enter a ""deep space"" mode - a random mode of the game and compete for the leaderboards, a feature missed in so many other good games.So, let's recap how your life will be organized if you dare install:1. Get better and better on your mouse instincts.2. Progress through the levels (you can also try to get 100% levels if you're hardcore).3. Find out there are a lot of levels and even more instincts involved.4. Continue up the levels (collecting ""stars"").5. Realize you're addicted and get help.6. Return from getting help and play indefinitely. FTW.Wondeful level and game design with hunderds of play hours awaiting me.Great music to follow you while you stare amazed at the soothing graphics.Haven't been this happy since I first found trackmania or played WC3!A true jem, probably because it's a game that is just built RIGHT. Design, implementation, the lots.Play. Enjoy. Compete. Repeat.Booga.P.S. I may just pay for the little DLC (which I don't really feel I need) just to give them another dollar.The price is rediculusly low. I almost thought it was crap just because of it..			"

												There's just one inherent problem with this game's design.Did you divert from the set path the level developers set out for you? Prepare to miss a ton of stuff and/or die nine out of ten times.There's literally no room for experimentation and when what you're supposed to do isn't immediately clear (which is often) you're generally punished for trying to figure things out. Combine that with how frustratingly precise the waves you need to make are a lot of the time and the end result is just a tedious mess of a game. Apparently I've only played through four worlds and there are something like 7 or 8 left (plus the DLC that I unfortunately purchased). I don't see myself returning to this game though, it's not enjoyable to me.			"

												Waveform is an ego-shooting RTS city building war simulation strategy platformer with highly advanced 3D text-based graphics that actively requires you to think and work with what you believe in. The levels are challenging, the game concept is complex, the graphics are stunning and the music is making you feel warm and fuzzy.However, what if the game that is presented us here is not actually the way it seems? What if the light transmission that you resemble is actually a communistic propaganda transmission that is meant to destroy the already desolated parts of space that you have to visit in the game?What if the developer of the game is actually not a brave American that loves this country and is secretly reporting to foreign forces like China and Russia instead?I am just asking questions.The levels you visit are designed in colorful schemes and the text-input that you have to play the game with is presented to you in a deliberately socialistic manner. How can we know that this game is not actually a Russian spy program that tries to make your brain feel positive about terrible horrors like communism?As well as most people here, I also wrote several scientific essays about this game, but in contrast to what the mainstream media presents to you, I do not fully agree in the concept that this game is just a nice indie game, instead I have the theory that this nice indie game is actually a secret communistic agenda developed by satanists that try to overthrow the free government in the US as well as everywhere else, like Canada or New Hampshire.This game is a riddle. This game is a mystery and as long as the developer does not stand up and actively defends our constitution, I cannot trust him that this game is not a mean propaganda piece and as such, I cannot fully support it.God bless America.

												I bought this game yesterday for 19 cents, and didn't even look at the game. I checked how positive it was rated, and it was pretty high. I just bought it and downloaded and played it today.This is a nice little game and definitely worth the 19 cents, so I'd recommend picking it up now it's still on sale.Also this game has dlc as it's supposed to be, extra content, unlike all the dlc's nowadays, basically selling you a 1/4 game and telling you to buy their ""dlc's"".

												Waveform is a very entertaining game. The music is very well done and enjoyable, and the graphics, although simple, are very beautiful. The game doesn't provide much story, but it's one of those games that doesn't need to. It's addicting and it actually makes you want to get 100% on the levels, unlike many games with a similar mechanic. Overall, I would give Waveform a nine out of ten.			"

												Waveform is a skill-based game where you control a photon's wave frequency and amplitude with the mouse to collect colored orbs, get a high score, and reach the level's end. Players go through levels around Pluto, all the way up to the Sun, seeing new mechanics along the way.Admittedly, I bought this game not expecting much, but I was met with an excellent experience that really tested my reflexes and ability to plan ahead.One can progress the base story simply by making it to the end of the level, but the full challenge of this game comes from getting the highest score possible in every level. Players have to really know how changing a wave's properties will affect the photon riding it.There are various mechanics in addition to moving the wave, like obstacles, gases that change wave speed, color combos and colored obstacles, and more. These quickly make the game very dynamic and fresh through every level.The game comes with a base story mode which is fairly linear, but also has secret levels, endless modes, and a challenge mode once you beat the story.I got this game for cheap in a bundle, and I'd say it was money well spent. If you're looking for a reflex-based, arcade-style game, Waveform is worth a look.			"

												Waveform may be simple in concept, but flawless execution, decent music and the developer's  imagination makes it a memorable game. Be warned though, it gets tough. And I mean really tough.And as a kind of footnote, the dev deserves kudos for his unstinting efforts to improve the game after feedback left on the Steam forums. When I had a technical issue, he asked me to Skype him so he could go through several solutions with me! You don't get that with Rockstar or Electronic Arts. :)			"

												5 / 5What an absolute joy of a game. And this really is as pure of a game as I've played in a long time. You have a small ball of light trying to traverse the cosmos (various maps set against a back drop of space) by way of a sine wave. You control its travel by altering the sine wave...move the mouse up / down and the amplitude (height) grows / diminshes...move the mouse left / right and the frequency increases / decreases (how steep it goes up / down). Hit power ups, multipliers, and various other typical point scoring devices to get a high score and progress from map to map. Dodge black matter and various other space based hazards otherwise you lose points / fail the map.The basic gameplay structure (points based map completion) is old hat, but the mechanic of controlling  something via manipulation of a sine wave is unique and utterly appropriate for the simple premise of the game. Combined with a an excellent soundtrack (which somehow manages to combine a light hearted sound with something suitable to wandering through the depths of space) you'll find yourself smiling as you play this wonderful game.

												The concept of this game seems simple. You're controlling the path of a little orb by manipulating a wave. Collect orbs and score high.This game is however, anything but simple. Every few levels, you're dealing with new mechanics, whether it be a threat, or a new way to move, on top of the already existing mechanics. Once you get past a few sets of levels, it becomes harder and harder to focus on adjusting your wave when you're dodging well...many things.The soundtrack is well done and sortof puts you into a trance. It's really enjoyable and I'd listen to it for ages. The game itself offers a lot of interesting gameplay for it's low, low price. So I say this is definitely one of your must-haves.			"

												basic Rythem/ puzzle game not anything to call home over but not aful. The basic concept here is you need to match the wave to a shape that collects all the orbs while avoiding what appeard to be black holes or space debris. The game ahs allot of levels one for each planet in our solar system and DLC for those super keen but overall it falls a bit flat with repitiion. Not bad for short sessions or time killers. Music also had a pretty good vibe to it even though its not always paired so well with the level being played.			"

												Simple and fun game. Player guides sphere that is in constant waving motion. You can only control amplitude (how far up and down wave goes) and frequency (how many times wave goes up and down in certain amount of time) by moving your mouse. Goal is to collect items from level and avoid hitting obstacles. Controls are super simple but It still may take a short while to get hang of it. But after you do, this is really nice and relaxing game to play.After playing some levels I was worried game is actually too simple and repeating itself. But when getting to new planets, lots of new items, obstacles and helpers still keeps game interesting.Small annoyance is that sometimes just one hit can cause level to fail and you need to start from beginning or from last checkpoint which may be pretty far away. And it is really hard to say whenever hitting some obstacle causes this. Also planet/level selecting could be a bit faster, for example when trying to find levels where you could still improve your result.But those are very minor problems. Generally it seems to be easy to lost an hour staring this wave on the screen. Graphics works and this is one of the rare games where I haven't turned music off.There's lots of levels to play and you can advance to next level after passing previous one, no matter how poorly you did it. However getting perfect score from any level isn't easy, so there's definitely lots of challenge. Game is at least worth of its cheap price. "

												Oscilloscopes made fun.You control the amplitude and the frequency of a sine wave in order to collect all pick-ups on the level while avoiding obstacles. That's it. Despite the simplicity of the premise, the game plays surprisingly well, and has way more effort put into levels, art, music, and even writing, than one might expect from something with such a minimalist concept. Achieving 100% on all levels must be incredibly frustrating, though.P.S.On Linux, the game froze a few times on my computer (mostly when alt-tabbing and opening Steam overlay). Running it in a borderless window rather than full-screen seemed to alleviate that problem. If you take a look at the forums, some people have reported similar issues with Windows, too, as well as gave some solutions on how to mitigate them. Nonetheless, the technical issues weren't distracting enough to ruin my experience with the game.			"

												This is a challenging little game... and I do recommend it (specially since you can almost get it for free) ...But it definitely has its pros and cons. It's a great game to play while listening to your own music or a podcast, in that way, it is quite relaxing. The difficulty increases as you progress, but it's a lot of fun to go back to the first levels and realize that even though they are the same levels, the player has improved considerably and gained a lot of skill with no need for any type of ingame mechanics. In a way it's you, the player, the one who's leveled up. And that's something I really appreciate and find interesting. However, the game gets repetitive soon enough. I had planned to see the end of the game, but right before the final stages, you basically have to go all the way back and get better scores in every level for you to be able to carry on. As I said, that can be fun to do once or twice to see how you have improved, but to do them (almost) all again? To be honest, the game had already started to get quite tedious at this point and blocking the end behind a score didn't really help. Many casual players will probably see this as a burden, more than anything else. And I don't think Waveform appeals to a lot of hardcore players, as the reviews in steam show (as far as I can see not many have played more than an hour). So to sum it up:+ very cheap price+ interesting and original concept+ natural progression of player's skills+ relaxing and slow paced: perfect if you want to listen to podcasts or music while playing- ending blocked behind score requirements, forcing you to play almost everything again- quite repetitive			"

												A unique arcade-style game which tries out a new concept and nails it, with surprisingly clever level design and a relaxing, surreal atmosphere. In this game, you don't control the character directly, but you control the shape of its path. The game's difficulty is determined by how you play it, being calming and easy if you just want to see the sights, and brutally hard if you're OCD for perfect scores.If you liked BIT.TRIP BEAT, or if you couldn't get into that game because of the difficulty, give this a try.

												Waveform is a decent arcade game that turns extremely tedious towards the end.The core concept is unique and rather well implemented. You control a beam of light and you need to collect as many orbs as possible in each level. Things start pretty simple, but soon enough you have to deal with mirrors, wormholes and even aliens.The early levels are good fun and the game does a decent job of introducing new elements to keep things interesting. Unfortunately around the time you get to Mercury the game turns into incredibly obnoxious grindfest. Each level will require higher and higher amount of stars from previous levels to unlock and you spend way too much time grinding through levels you have already finished. This isn't helped by the fact that the radar game mechanic introduced in the Mercury levels is rather tedious.I grinded through Mercury but once I got to the Sun levels I decided I had had enough. Replaying the earlier levels repeatedly wasn't much fun anymore. While I enjoyed the first few hours of Waveform, I can't really recommend the game as a whole.The good:- Unique idea- Good fun early onThe bad:- Gets extremely grindy and tedious towards the end due to level unlock requirements- Even minor mistakes can really hurt your score if you are on a high multiplierThe ugly:- Some of the checkpoints are poorly placed			"

												At first this game was sort of confusing and weird, and seemed sort of cheap, but after playing the first level and getting the hang of the control scheme you will really get into the great music, visuals and simplicity that can get quite challenging.Like a relaxed version of geometry dash.

												Sadly the 30 minutes I've put into waveform will probably be the last. I feel like this game would be much better suited for touchscreens as its a bit of a snooze with a mouse. Waveform asks you to move a waveform to collect dots while relaxing music plays in the background. I don't mind mindless relaxing games, and I often play Chime before bedtime, but this game isn't very relaxing either. It seems like a novel attempt to pass the time, but without a touchscreen I have to pass. -PR0XIDIAN			"

												Waveform is a perfect example of a unique idea done right. The gameplay is executed flawlessly, the style is unique, and there is certainly plenty of meat to the game. The only real downfall is that it seems to be undedicated to a single audience; it seems to be and plays somewhat like a puzzle game yet is at times extremely fast-paced and incredibly difficult, two things which are generally not seen together. For what it does, Waveform is an amazing game, and one that many hours could be poured into.The first hurdle newcomers to the game will encounter is the gameplay mechanics. Not because they're flawed and unplayable, but because they're different than anything else you've likely played before, meaning it can take an hour or two of trial and error to truly understand how to use it. It's honestly easier to see in Waveform's trailer than it is to explain, but to sum it up: You control a wavy line of light, and the only thing you can't do with it is slow it down. Your goal is to collect orbs and waves while avoiding various obstacles and using the environment to your advantage to change your path or the objects around you.The second thing that will likely be offputting is the game's difficulty. Expect to have to repeat levels and sections of levels multiple times in order to simply pass the level, especially if it's a level that requires (near-)perfection in a certain section in order to succeed. When you finally do succeed, don't be surprised to receive a rating of 30%, either, as the game is quite stingy with its ratings, requiring practically flawless runs of an entire level to get the full 10-star 100% rating. Luckily, the game does have checkpoints and levels generally aren't terribly long, plus you don't need anywhere near the max number of stars to access the levels you need them to unlock. Still, you're likely to end up frustrated at times with Waveform, especially if you're the completionist type.Other than those potential issues and some others like repetitive audio, Waveform is a great game. It's very chill for the most part, unless you're going for 100% in every level or run into a difficult level or section. There are little bits of story after some levels that, while not exactly Mass Effect-level engrossing, are intriguing. Despite the difficulty, there will be few places where it feels like the mistakes you make are the fault of the game. You won't be able to find a game elsewhere like it, and it does what it does well, thus Waveform gets a strong recommend from me.			"

												Simple. Elegant. Soothing. There you'll have waveform in a nutshell. The game is all about controlling the amplitude and length of a 'ship' that moves in a continuous sinusoide (why? because it's a videogame). But controls are easy and hard at the same time, because creating an arc that picks up most pickups or avoids asteroids/black holes requires some forward thinking that even veteran gamers will take a while to master (it's pretty unique in this aspect).The game isn't exactly engaging or tense, but pretty good at what it does, though loading screens and menus could've been better (some things just take too many clicks). There isn't enough variation (there is some) to warrant 15 or even 10 bucks, but at 5? Certainly. :-)			"

												While I did enjoy Waveform immensely, it falls just barely shy of being one of my favorites. It's fresh gameplay is strangely addicting, and the speed and movement of the game allows for a lot of adaptability and logic from the player's end. The game doesn't have any crippling flaws. Whenever I messed up, it was my fault not the games. But the game seems to have a bit of a resentful attitude towards adequacy. When I got to the Mercury and Sun levels, the game continuously smacked me in the forehead, saying, ""450 stars!? You call that good! Go back and get some more, you ingrateful fool!"". For most of those levels, I'd continuously roll my eyes as I'd scroll back to Pluto and Neptune to replay levels I had already beat just to continue playing the game. If this doesn't bother you or you're rather the perfectionist, this game is perfect for you. I'd just advise caution to people who like to keep their casual games... casual.			"

It's one of those games that is infuriatingly difficult to get 100% completion on a level, but luckily the fun-factor is high and you always find yourself having 'just one more go'.The catchy electronic soundtrack provides very pleasant accompaniment - never irritating, and its blippy tunes have a charming retro feel to them.As a way to wile away an hour or two, Waveform is hard to fault - and harder to put down once started.Excellent 9/10.

												A simple game that starts to get more involved as you progress. The core mechanic of manipulating the wavelength is easy to get the hang of, but the game is also fond of slowly adding more obstacles and other stage gimmicks making you adapt to new concepts that may or may not be related to the planet world you're on. It's a neat game that does well to pass time and it's satisfying to find the perfect ""track"" to collect all the light. The game is a bit tedious in the sense that it's not incredibly hard to run into moving obstacles while on an awkward wavelength and having to subtly adjust constantly to avoid getting hit, which may have you miss a lot of light in the process of not following a certain path. I don't know if I would've paid the full $5 for this game but I would say it's worth the current $0.19. If you don't mind those things, or a game that starts to slowly become more challenging while keeping its mainly casual feel, I'd recommend this game.			"

												Purchasing Waveform when it's on sale is a no-brainer. The game runs fantastic on linux, and offers a huge amount of content for those who become enamored with its simplistic formula: hidden levels, endless mode, challenge levels, chase sequences, and mechanics exclusive to levels are used to great effect.The initial campaign has a solid pace (for the beginning), with new aspects being spinkled in frequently and gradually becoming more difficult, and should last around 8 hours. However, towards the late game, you will be required to grind to gain access to the game's later levels if you score below a certain threshold consistently, as I did. Fortunately it's not too much of a chore to do so, since your skill at the game will allow you to easily ace the earlier levels.All in all, Waveform is stellar if you can afford the pricey 19 cent pricetag. It'll lure you in with its bargain, and pleasantly surprise you with its quality.			"

												Waveform is a very interesting game for people who love space and have free time. I like this game because it has good quality and great and easy gameplay. This game is very fun and interesting. Being a teen game reviewer, I would recommend this game to anyonw out there that likes space and strategy games.			"

												Neat little game with interesting gameplay.Totally not my kind of game, but I can recognize good work.Putting score-based locks in later levels prevented me from finishing it. Too bad. I didn't care for my score, just casual play.			"

												Waveform is a perfect example of a unique idea done right. The gameplay is executed flawlessly, the style is unique, and there is certainly plenty of meat to the game. The only real downfall is that it seems to be undedicated to a single audience; it seems to be and plays somewhat like a puzzle game yet is at times extremely fast-paced and incredibly difficult, two things which are generally not seen together. For what it does, Waveform is an amazing game, and one that many hours could be poured into.The first hurdle newcomers to the game will encounter is the gameplay mechanics. Not because they're flawed and unplayable, but because they're different than anything else you've likely played before, meaning it can take an hour or two of trial and error to truly understand how to use it. It's honestly easier to see in Waveform's trailer than it is to explain, but to sum it up: You control a wavy line of light, and the only thing you can't do with it is slow it down. Your goal is to collect orbs and waves while avoiding various obstacles and using the environment to your advantage to change your path or the objects around you.The second thing that will likely be offputting is the game's difficulty. Expect to have to repeat levels and sections of levels multiple times in order to simply pass the level, especially if it's a level that requires (near-)perfection in a certain section in order to succeed. When you finally do succeed, don't be surprised to receive a rating of 30%, either, as the game is quite stingy with its ratings, requiring practically flawless runs of an entire level to get the full 10-star 100% rating. Luckily, the game does have checkpoints and levels generally aren't terribly long, plus you don't need anywhere near the max number of stars to access the levels you need them to unlock. Still, you're likely to end up frustrated at times with Waveform, especially if you're the completionist type.Other than those potential issues and some others like repetitive audio, Waveform is a great game. It's very chill for the most part, unless you're going for 100% in every level or run into a difficult level or section. There are little bits of story after some levels that, while not exactly Mass Effect-level engrossing, are intriguing. Despite the difficulty, there will be few places where it feels like the mistakes you make are the fault of the game. You won't be able to find a game elsewhere like it, and it does what it does well, thus Waveform gets a strong recommend from me.			"

												Waveform is one of those cheap games that I'm happy I bought.I find the game quite relaxing.Generally you're a dot following waves, where all the curves can be controlled by dragging your mouse. The object is to gain as many points as possible by touching blue orbs and powerups with you ship while following the waves.It is very simplistic but hard to perfect, it feels really smooth and is way more fun than originally expected.The soundtrack fits the game perfectly and ofcourse there is the trading cards which generally make the game free if bought on discount.Best exit button ever actually works: ""Escape""42/10 Should play while stoned.

Overall score: 2/10Did I get my money's worth?: YesRecommended input: Keyboard/mouseI really tried to give this game a chance. It was one of the first games I bought and I've forced myself to play little by little since I first got it. It's a simple puzzle game with a unique concept of collecting points by following a curved line. Put simply, the game isn't for everyone. As other reviews show, they don't find the game to be bad, just not a game for them. I can say the same, which raises a question of how big or small the number of people who would enjoy this game must be. Yes, the reviews are pretty good, but those who weren't interested in the game also never bought it.I'm a fan of puzzle games. I like to analize the problem and I love the feeling of acing the puzzle. Where Waveform lacks in this aspect is that changes in direction need to be done abruptly. I've found myself in a state of panic trying to get points or dodge obstructions and I don't see this as much of a relaxing game because of that. With that, the game is painfully boring. Minutes playing this game drag on for what feels like hours in the worst way possible. I've kept myself playing to get all of the card drops and I've gotten more enjoyment from toggling in-game options than playing the actual game. Again and again, I look around for something else to do in this game. A hidden minigame, maybe a summary of the game's story so far, even credits to watch instead of actually playing the game. I've clicked on distant planets hoping that some hidden secret will pop up to keep me engaged and nothing. The game's concept dies off so quickly and playing through more than a level or two is unbearable.Where I drew the last straw and rushed over to the store page to give a negative review was after I played the first moon stage. The moon stage is the same as a normal stage, but the entire map is warped and moves inconsistently in a distored manner, I guess to add an extra level of difficulty for the special stage, but all this did was give me a headache by the time I finished it. No longer can I play this game and no longer can I tell myself that it deserves more. Go ahead, play the distorted map for a while. You might have a stronger tolerance than me, but play it two or three times and you'll hate it as well. This was the final nail in the coffin for me and of all the thousands of games that I own, I've never played a game that I dislike this much. On another note, the soundtrack is okay. I'll give it that, but the rest of the game has left such a bad taste in my mouth that the music now annoys me as well.			"

												Fun adictive game, unique mechanics, and ultra cheap, and it is on sale at the moment, it's a steal, get it. Comes with 3 card drops, and only need 5 cards to craft the badge. Good stuff.- Gameplay 10/10 - Unique adictive game play will keep you playing it longer than you attended.- Graphics 8/10 - For what it is the graphics are easy on the eyes, and is not image heavy, small download, plays on any graphics card. Maybe could have been a little more flashy, but I'm not complaining.- Sound 9/10 - Nice flowing, relaxing tune as you ride the light wave, can get repetitious, but still not a bad thing. "

												If you love space and puzzles like I do, you will love this game. I find the tags attached to this rather odd as it clearly is not an action game. The game requires a combination of careful planning, timing, reaction and precise mouse control; you must be one with your mouse.The game's premise is simple but executed in an addictive format that will challenge you. Don't let the videos fool you, this game is difficult.You control both the frequency and the amplitude of a light wave in an effort to collect objects and map your way through the universe as cleanly as possible. Harder difficulties add obstacles and items, adding to the variety of the game and keeping if fresh in addition  to adding a nice challenge.The game can become quite addictive as you strive to come close to perfecting each level, a difficult task in itself.All in all, a beautiful, challenging, and addictive ride through space. You will enjoy this.			"

												I really wish that there was a ""Maybe” option when writing a review because this game is good, but not great. I got the game while it was on sale and it is enjoyable. Good music, decent controls, and entertaining. But it is not worth $5. Honestly, if the graphics were just a bit worse, it could be a flash game. My one real gripe, besides the price, is that there seems to be a bug sometimes causing your wave to get off center or just not line up no matter what you do and that can ruin a good time. So I would say that if you find this game on sale, buy it, its not a bad game, However do not buy it for the whole $5 because that seems a bit over priced.  "

												I bought this game because it was reeeally cheap and it's got card drops. But I wouldn't do that, if I weren't interested in the game as well. :) It seems like a nice action puzzle game. If you get used to the controls, the game might be more about fast thinking and reflexes - at the start it's more about not screwing up entirely.Controlling the wave needs a bit getting used to - the instructions are clear but I felt counterintuitive at first. Do I need wavelength or amplitude? ""Nooo, why are you doing the exact opposite of what I want?"" (Hint: It's because I sucked.)It's fun to play for short bursts. If you can read or play games while on the bus or as a car passenger, you might be okay with longer periods as well.Sadly, I'm not one of those people. I got motion sickness from this game after about 15 minutes... urrgh. :D			"

												A nice, relaxing game. Simple yet effective, probably not going to Rule The Gameplaying World or anything but in this particular case the Metacritic score is pretty much right on the money. It can also be played with one hand, in case you're crippled or you like jacking off to waveforms. Apropos of nothing, except for the stuff it relates to: I have a friend who actually does that (jacks off to waveforms), his name is Chumpy because he's a BIG TIME Chump and is getting deported from Canada due to trying to put his anatomy inside a wall outlet at Rogers Centre one time too many also he keeps calling it the C.N. Tower which aggravates the Prime Minister to no end. Anyway this is probably his favorite game because he's an Engineer and also a pervert and can move the waveforms around while also cranking his voltometer. He gets ""amped up"" for ohms. haha also that's why this game is called a ""Simulation"" even though it is in no fu­cking way a ""Simulator"" and whoever added it to the Simulator category should be forced to cosplay as Robby the Robot when Chumpy's around. But also this game simulates the mind of Chumpy pretty well so that's why it's a Simulation game. ok well bye			"

												Waveform is an attractive minimalist action puzzle game that revolves around moving your mouse to catch blue baubles while avoiding obstacles and hitting mutliplier power-ups.  The concept is both easy to learn and unique enough to make the gameplay stand out.  The music in the game is nothing special but the space themed backdrops are attractive.  Overall this is a good indie game and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action puzzles.			"

												I played the first and second level then I stopped playing. I only left game open for card drops. Concept of the game is not interesting at all. There are far more interesting mobile games than Waveform. Also if you look at positive reviews, you'll notice most of the reviewers didn't play it more than 5 hours. Even though the price is really low, I advice you to avoid this game at any cost, even at sales. TL;DR - Instead of playing games I didn't pay for, I pay for games I never gonna play. Steam Sales, the exact opposite of piracy.			"

												I only played the first 2 levels and had zero desire to play the 3rd. The controls and gameplay are very unique. Which I think is a bad thing for a casual game like this. When I play a casual game I want something familiar or something with an easy learning curve. It seems like it would take some time to master the controls, and I don't feel like it would reward my time and effort. Would only recommend if you are specifically wanting something new and unique.			"

												Slow game that might be hard to master. It proves difficult to make you remember your right from your left, and your up from down, but with time you would gain skill easily.One part of the game was annoying to me. After each level it took 5+ clicks to get to the next level, waiting for the screen to respond inbetween clicks. Also clicking to skip the points being added up at the end of the level still slowly placed them up on the screen, making you wonder how much longer regular tally of points would take, which is still actually much longer. This makes time wasting antagonizing, but not unbearable.Overall, I did not like the wave format of collecting stars. It seemed to keep me focused on just the left half of the screen and middle, but rarely ever did I look to the right side of my huge screen.So much of the puzzle seemed to focus on moving that stupid reticle up and down and left and right that the wave did not matter nearly at all anyway. You have to adjust somewhere between the middle left your screen where the wave is shown, to where the reticule actually matters on the far left of the screen. Which means when the wave size and frequency changes, you have to adjust on the fly. Making the entire wave completly pointless.If you like slow games that you have to adjust your ship on the fly constantly, this game is for you.			"

												Unreasonably high CPU usage. It used 30-40% of my (decently high-end) processor while sitting at the main menu, and there wasn't even any form of animation. It continues the same into the game, which is fairly simplistic looking, and an interesting mechanic. Not worth playing when it heats up my room more than Battlefield 3 does though.			"

												Is the gameplay good? Yes.Is the game fun to play, engaging, and offers a good level of challenge? Yes.Would I normally recommend the game? Definitely.Why can't I?Because the game decided to put an arbitrary rule that you need to have a certain amount of stars to progress further into the game. These aren't resources that you use in the game or anything. Just an arbitrary number you need to get by getting good at the previous few levels. Just no. The game itself is the challenge. Don't make me grind previous levels in order to meet arbitrary thresholds that don't actually change the level of difficulty of the actual level.And don't ruin a great game.			"

												Waveform's really cool, a medium paced, gentle, abstract panic-inducer. The controls and gameplay are unique and basic, but like most great games, it takes a while to master. Think of a race game, but you're controlling a waveform .. Um. View video of it if you can and add a lot of active interaction. Every level you play can be beaten on the first time through, but you get bonuses in the game based on how well you do, so there is strong incentive to replay each level a few times to improve your rating on each. This might sound repetitive, but Waveform is excellent about each level being similar but different enough to keep players interested. Great music helps as well. So far, I haven't seen levels take longer than a few minutes, which also helps with replays, but that creates a very strong ""Just one more level"" effect. Waveform is like a puzzle race... sort of. I like it quite a bit. Have a look at it if you like good games that are off the beaten path.			"

												I cannot recommend this game, primarily because I cannot actually play it. Although I can reach the initial launch screen and press the play button, the game seems to break shortly after the ""Eden productions"" part of the credits rolls. I am left staring at a black screen with the music playing, but unable to take any action. Task manager lists the game as unresponsive. I cannot speak for everyone, but I know that this was a big dissapointment. If this is a problem for many people, then the developer has abdicated their responsiblity to fix their game. Would not recommend.			"

												This game is a masterpiece.You are an alien piloting an UFO, navigating through the stars using waveform energy.On your way, you must collect resources and avoid hazards.Because you are using waveform energy, you can travel forever, but only in a curved direction. This is the challenge of the game.People who sighted UFOs in real life said they even stay still or travel at enormous speeds.In the game, you travel at a huge speed, but it all seems slow because stars are far way and planets are in the background.However, you can't stay still in the game because an unknown force is chasing you.I won't spoil that here, but if you play the game you will find out who is chasing you.10/10 story, graphics and sound.

												For me there is no reason to not pick up this game. I have already spent 17+ hours playing it, trying to get 100% on every level, even though I'm still far from finishing that task. The soundtrack makes you calm, which is needed when facing tricky situiations. Gameplay wise it is different from other games I have ssen before and I really like it, it is easy to learn but harder to master. It got a fair amount of conent and replayability and I have no problem picking it back up every now and then when I feel like it. And as I stated in the beginning, for this price there is no reason to not pick it up if you remotly like the idea of the game.Pro:+ Easy to learn and pick back up after a longer pause+ Fair amount of content+ Great soundtrack+ Replayability+ Great Meachanics+ Low price+ Great visual styleCon:- Loading screens between every transition (about 1 to 2 seconds)- Endless modes sometimes feels a bit repetitive- Naviagtion between zones is a bit anoying (only one step at a time) As you might have noticed, I had to be really picky for my contra arguments of this game and I think that says enough.TL;DR: Great value for the price and if you like the concept seen within the videos, pick it up and try it.

I am a fan of those old-school arcade games where you really have to master the gameplay to advance through the game and this game has that element (if you want to achieve perfect scores, for example). Although you can complete the game without too much practice if you don't want to bother.I really like the gameplay here, graphics are nice, the sound and music is great and there is quite a bit of replay value if you want to achieve perfect scores or reach higher levels in ""deep space mode"".

												Probably (one of the, if not,) the best game in Steam your dollar can buy. Don't discriminate Waveform based on games within the same price range, this is VERY polished, with decent graphics, few technical bugs, and excellent soundtrack. Heck, I would gladly pay ten times it's $0.69 price tag. Singular mechanics, yes, but it is indeed one of those ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" games.			"

												notice how I only have 5 minutes played of the game. You're probably asking,""Why write a review with 5 minutes?."" I can think of a reason! I CAN'T PLAY IT. It will open, and it will run perfectly without crashing. BUT, when I open it, the game is 3 times larger than my screen, and I can't make the window smaller. PLEASE fix this. I spent 89 cents on this game and i want my money's worth. I can't really recommend or not recommend this game because I haven't had a chance to play it, so, for now, I'll just say that I recommend it, because I don't want to be a jackass.			"

												I picked this up for 19 cents and the DLC for 24, so you can't really go wrong there!As for the game itself, it's a nifty little ""puzzle"" game, where you control a sine wave-form, to guide yourself through different levels, getting the highest score and the most amount of stars possible.The mechanics are quite easy - drag in a certain direction to change the wave-form, but that doesn't mean the game itself is easy.If you can pick this game up on sale, I highly recommend doing so as it's a good time-killer & you can probably actually make a profit from selling the newly included Steam trading cards, which is always a nice bonus :)			"

												I cannot recommend this game, primarily because I cannot actually play it. Although I can reach the initial launch screen and press the play button, the game seems to break shortly after the ""Eden productions"" part of the credits rolls. I am left staring at a black screen with the music playing, but unable to take any action. Task manager lists the game as unresponsive. I cannot speak for everyone, but I know that this was a big dissapointment. If this is a problem for many people, then the developer has abdicated their responsiblity to fix their game. Would not recommend.			"

												An interesting idea. Kind of fun. Some critiques.1. It doesn't give you any feedback on what you need to proceed other than some vague notion that you need to get high scores to unlock further levels. I got a few 50% and 60%'s and yet I haven't been held up. No challenge = not a lot of fun. 2. When you are in the groove and can tell what wave patterns to make this game can be very fun. But the moment you get out of that groove, you will be smashing into bombs, missing the gems and struggling hopelessly to try to regain your once amazing amazingness. How could the developer have fixed this? Easy. A ""Reset the Wave"" button. Do I have to think of everything?Don't buy this unless its 75% off.			"

												Beauty through simplicity, excellent music (this is the first game that I have ever felt compelled to but the soundtrack from,) and incredible replayability make Waveform an excellent game.The control is simple, move the mouse to heighten or shrink the wave, and to increase or decrease the frequency. Try to line up with the light orbs and multiplier rings to collect points, but avoid the dark matter. As you progress, that game offer more things, such as mirrors that you bounce off of, to use to collect light and avoid darkness. Branching paths and hidden levels keep the gameplay fresh, and offer multiple ways to advance if you outskill the planet you are on, while the Eris DLC offers extra challenge to anyone who wants more. I bought this game on the Steam for Linux release sale, and I wouldn't of minded paying full price, It is definitely worth it. Also, buy the soundtrack too, its the best part of the game.			"

												I like this game. I haven't seen this mechanic used before! Or if I have I've completely forgotten about it :PYou control the period and amplitude of a little orb travelling along a sine wave, trying to get it to catch as many glowing orbs as you can as it goes along. You get points for getting as many orbs as possible and doing other cool things, and you get stars based on how well you did in the level. You'll later find power ups that provide you with shields, speed changes, etc as well as bad orbs that do damage, and so on.It can take a while getting used to the mechanics, as they are fairly novel. Once you know what you're doing, it's a very relaxing yet challenging game.I would recommend picking this up if you have the spare change!			"

												An interesting idea. Kind of fun. Some critiques.1. It doesn't give you any feedback on what you need to proceed other than some vague notion that you need to get high scores to unlock further levels. I got a few 50% and 60%'s and yet I haven't been held up. No challenge = not a lot of fun. 2. When you are in the groove and can tell what wave patterns to make this game can be very fun. But the moment you get out of that groove, you will be smashing into bombs, missing the gems and struggling hopelessly to try to regain your once amazing amazingness. How could the developer have fixed this? Easy. A ""Reset the Wave"" button. Do I have to think of everything?Don't buy this unless its 75% off.			"

												This game is unlike any game I have ever played.  It is a very interesting concept and in the right frame of mind could be absolute heaven.You are a dot following a wave up and down.  There are things that you want your dot to hit.  In order to hit the things, you have to alter the wave.   There are 2 ways you can control the wave.  I apologize if I misuse any terms as directly dealing with waves isn't part of my day to day life.The X axis controls the frequency.  Left to right makes the wave go up and down slower.  Right to left makes the wave go up and down faster.  So if you go all the way to the left, your dot is bouncing up and down like a chihuahua on crack whereas all the way to the right would be like very slowly hitting a speed bump.The Y axis controls the amplitude.  Top to bottom makes the wave move a smaller distance up and down.  Bottom to top makes the wave travel a father distance up and down.  So bottom to top makes it bounce up and down a lot farther and top to bottom makes it kind of squiggle in the middle of the screen.With that being said, I only played it for a little while before it stressed me out.  Having to keep both frequency and amplitude in your head at the same time while things are flying by you is a lot to take in.I will definitely return to this game but it'll have to catch me on the right day and today is just not one of those days.  I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a break from the norm or have a thing for physics.			"

												""A ""pure"" game, like tetris. Waveform is easy to understand, but difficult to master. While playing, I'm continuously surprised at how well the core mechanic of modifying the frequency and amplitude of a sine wave to collect points actually works. Awesome job, I love to see nicely done new mechanics like this."" ~EGN""One of those indie games with dozens of levels and simple game mechanics. You change wave length and frequency that ship will follow. The goal is to avoid obstacles while catching as many plasma as possible. I don't know why, but it's quite fun for first hour..."" ~Soony""Cool little game. simple and relaxing with good music. Nothing really special, but it passes the time just fine. One thing that would make the game better would be to be able to use your own music with the game kind of like Audiosurf or Melody's Escape.""~Macrosoft""I, personally, am not a fan of this game. Why? Because I suck at it. Horribly.But would I recommend it?Definitely. It's awesome and looks beautiful.

												When this game was 95% off I just bought it to make some profit with the cards and maybe have one or two hours of fun.However, the first time I started it up I was positively suprised. The soundtrack was relaxing and the graphics had a nice, spacey feeling to them. Gameplay wise this game has a perfect difficulty curve, right when you have mastered one aspect and start to get bored, a new gimmick is introduced to keep you on your toes. While it is easy to complete all the diferent levels, it is extremely hard to get 100% in every single one of them, so people who were looking for a challenge won't be dissapointed.Ultimately, I would have been willing to pay the full price for this game, it was definitely worth it, and for a meager 24 cents  it was one of the best purchases I have ever made.

												Manipulate the amplitude, frequency, and phase shift of a light wave to collect points and avoid hazards.Yeah, there's not a whole lot to this game; play one level and you've seen it all, unless you count the mixups and gimmicks later levels gradually introduce. It's something to keep in mind, despite the (perhaps surprisingly) low price tag: you may get bored of the game faster than you'd think.It's a neat idea, though, and the soundtrack alone is worth the game's cost. I have no regrets purchasing Waveform and playing through a few levels; neither should you.			"

												Beauty through simplicity, excellent music (this is the first game that I have ever felt compelled to but the soundtrack from,) and incredible replayability make Waveform an excellent game.The control is simple, move the mouse to heighten or shrink the wave, and to increase or decrease the frequency. Try to line up with the light orbs and multiplier rings to collect points, but avoid the dark matter. As you progress, that game offer more things, such as mirrors that you bounce off of, to use to collect light and avoid darkness. Branching paths and hidden levels keep the gameplay fresh, and offer multiple ways to advance if you outskill the planet you are on, while the Eris DLC offers extra challenge to anyone who wants more. I bought this game on the Steam for Linux release sale, and I wouldn't of minded paying full price, It is definitely worth it. Also, buy the soundtrack too, its the best part of the game.			"

												PROS:+ Great soundtrack.  Very relaxing and chill.+ Original idea.  I enjoy puzzle games and this one is unique.+ Beautiful graphics.  The visuals combined with the music is very soothing.VERY BIG CON:- There is no option to invert the controls! This makes it an issue for me, who likes to 100% the levels, and the counter-intuitive controls make it very difficult to do since this game is unforgiving.  It is beyond frustrating when I move the mouse up and expect the wave to go down, and then remember, oh, I can't do that in this game.I absolutely love music-based games (Waves, Every Extend Extra, Chime, Rez, Bit-Trip Runner, etc) and I am really sad that the controls in this game bother me so much.  It's almost a deal-breaker, but I will keep at it.  I cannot believe this game has been out for so long without an update to invert the controls.  Please fix this.  =[			"

												Normally, Waveform would be the kind of game where I say ""That looks pretty cool, but it really isn't my kind of game, so I'll pass.""However, I noticed it purely because of the 95% discount on it. The price was taken down to a mere 24 cents. I decided to buy it.I'm quite pleased. Waveform is has a high level of good design for an indie game, and is more than worth the purchase -- even at its normal, non-discounted price.The game looks quite complicated in the trailer, and to some extent, it is. Still, it's not as complex as it looks, for whatever that's worth.Controls are actually quite simple. ""You"", or the little orb on the left which is moving right, travel in the shape of a sine wave. This is because you play the role of a photon, which behaves as a wave. (And a particle, but lets not get too sciencey) You increase/decrease your frequency by moving the mouse left/right, and you increase/decrease your amplitude by moving the mouse up/down. That's the full extent of the game controls, besides pause, of course.In layman's terms, you follow a wibbly-wobbly line. Mouse left or right to make your wibble-wobble do a full wibble and wobble in less or more time, and mouse up or down to make the top of the wibble higher or lower.This is a difficult mechanic to toy with, but the game has a gentle difficulty curve. The first level contains only light orbs -- doodads you collect to score points. The next few contain dark matter -- doodads you don't want to touch. Regardless, the game does a very good job of telegraphing what you need to do, and often, your goal of collecting light orbs coincides with a path that avoids all dark matter.Over the course of the game, you are introduced to more and more objects that you can interact with. Mirrors can be used to reflect your wave, orbiters can be used to collect light orbs in a wider radius, and wormholes can be used to warp past deadly clusters of bad stuff. These are just a few examples; the list goes on.The game is also designed to appeal well to both the casual and hardcore audience. Casual players can find suitable challenge in simply completing the core levels. Hardcore players can find suitable challenging in gaining a 100% score in every level. The game doesn't end there either; it also includes ""deep space modes"", which are randomly-generated endless levels that challenge you to survive against harder scenarioes while collecting points and speeding up ever-so-slightly.

												I'm intrigued by this game so far. It's nice, simple, and is pretty comforting to play after a day of action packed online shooters. I have to say I love it. It has a good difficulty curve (literally I might add), the music is relaxing, and for the price of a hamburger at a fast food joint (or 20 cents if you're getting it on sale) you really can't go wrong here. So far I haven't unlocked all the content, but I like what I see so far. I'll probably be updating this review as time passes, but it won't change the recommendation I give it. I'm not even half-way in, and I've spent several hours on this. usually indie games like this are super short, so I'm pleasantly surprised.			"

Once we get into the groove, we may find ourselves addicted to the desire of completing each level to 100%.Dear Wife:This is a nice game that we can sink some hours into. It will definitely improve our hand-eye coordination skills as well our ability to connect patterns. Kept/REMOVED:Everything about this game is lovely. Definitely worth the space it requires.My Last Thoughts: To me, it feels like a runner/puzzle game with the concept of Tetris. I always enjoy myself when I play it.

												This game is a masterpiece.You are an alien piloting an UFO, navigating through the stars using waveform energy.On your way, you must collect resources and avoid hazards.Because you are using waveform energy, you can travel forever, but only in a curved direction. This is the challenge of the game.People who sighted UFOs in real life said they even stay still or travel at enormous speeds.In the game, you travel at a huge speed, but it all seems slow because stars are far way and planets are in the background.However, you can't stay still in the game because an unknown force is chasing you.I won't spoil that here, but if you play the game you will find out who is chasing you.10/10 story, graphics and sound. Very relaxing and complex at the same time.			"

												+Very unusual gameplay+Soundtrack, very chilling and nice+The pricepoint is really DIVINE, other game publishers should learn from this example !+Graphics is also great and it works visually to complete the experience and its radical idea.You cant move, because you are a wave. But instead you can shapeshift indefinitely being a sinewave, you also have to... And you conquer the obsticles and hit powerups, wormholes and items.The controls are a bit unpredictable by every measurement.Instead you start to see the result, and you begin to match with the result every time.In most games, you have some feedback of some sort about your location.It took some plays to get used to being a wave.But when that was done, you will control it and navigate through the solar system, with much visualization and intuition.-I hate being a wave.

If you're not looking for a challange then I would probably pass but if having a difficult control scheme doesn't bother you, then by all means have at it.			"

												I tried to like this game, it seemed well reviewed. However, it honestly felt like I was screwing around with an oscilloscope and a function generator. That's really what this game boils down to. Similar to screwing around with a scope and function generator, it's fun for a few minutes, but quickly gets old.The controls are a bit odd - left/right mouse movements increases/decreases frequency, and up/down increases/decreases amplitude. However, there's no left/right waveform shift, so half the time you end up out of phase with the dots and it's aggravating.Music was not that great actually. Kind of like I was constantly in an underwater level on an SNES game. ""bloopy techno"" would be the best way to describe it.			"

												Challanging.Simple Innovative Puzzle Game.Love the Menu Soundtrack.It's really hard, I'd a lot of mistakes just for the first mission, failing for only 1 path of the ""dot things"" can really affect my wave-path and maybe it will take my time to get atleast 80% progress for the first mission, haha.

												Very relaxing, fun, and best of all, simple to pick up and go.The space theme goes well with the soundtrack and the whole game flows really nicely.I would recommend it for its cheap price tag and enjoyable gameplay, along with a kickass OST.Don't listen to reviews that claim it gets boring, there is a new song and style for every level.And, to be honest, for 79p it is an outstanding game.

												Controls were no fun for me.  Trying to match the pattern, and at the point it hits the left side of the screen, was something I was neither good at, nor any fun trying.  I had a really hard time getting the video resolution to run properly on my 1080p TV.  It defaulted to 1080p, but the game started and there were not buttons (turns out they were off screen), and my TV was on the correct setting.  I lowered the resolution a number of times until I found one that actually had all the buttons on the screen.  Then the gameplay alone, just wasn't fun for me.  Graphics and sound were ok.			"

												Okay, first of all as a student of Electrical engineering, I work with waves quite often. When I saw this game, I just wanted to play a game based around waves to see how it is implemented. So, I bought Waveform.After playing it for a few hours I was not disappointed, infact on the contrary I enjoyed every minute of it. :D The gameplay is smooth, the controls are well implemented. The graphics are cool too. But the best thing in my opinion, is that it never lets you get bored, there is always new stuff and interesting mechanisms around the corner as you progress. The core gameplay remains the same so its not very complicated. The soundtrackis awesome and relaxing. Well done EDEN Industries.I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is a cool little game that different from just about any game its fun and simple but theres one problemthis game is hard for all the wrong reasons mainly im talking about the completion which basically means you have to get every single one of those blue dot things to get it which is kind of ridculous i don't mean to sound like im complaining here but i feel like they should have toned that down a littlealso yes this game does rely on sound a bit just an fyi7/10			"

												What else can I say that no one has ever said before. Now, this is a good game. It never stops surprising me every time I open it. Not very easy, but not hard. The difficulty of this game is just perfect. The controls are simple and you'll understand them without any effort, but what I liked the most, is that you have to play frequently to dominate and master them. If you have one dollar and you don't know what to buy, I absolutely recommend this game. It's cheap, it's fun, if you haven't bought this game yet, I don't have the slightest idea about what are you doing reading this review, go and buy it.			"

												The game's mechanics is very interesting and difficult to navigate at first. Until you are able to correctly remember how the wave changes based on your mouse-click-drags, you will have a tough time playing this game. However, once you are comfortable with the mechanics, you will enjoy the game if you enjoy completion games - where you keep practicing the runs until you can have a 100% run.  Graphics are very smooth and pretty. The soundtrack keeps you entertained throughout the game. I tend to zone it out as I'm focused on manipulating the wave and seeing what is coming up. Overall, interesting and amusing game. Not the type of game I normally invest a lot of time in, but I wouldn't mind playing this every once in a while. 8/10 from me.			"

												GENIUS game mechanic.....but so hard to wrap my mind around. that I quit at the second level because I knew I would never be good enough to play the game properly....which is a shame since the game has such a nice soundtrack. It's basically a score attack/high score style game, so if you aren't perfectly attuned with its wave control mechanic, you won't be able to enjoy the game for what it is.			"

												I feel like Waveform is a bit of a hidden gem.Move your mouse to plot a trajectory through space. Avoid obstacles and picke up bonuses.Sounds ludicrously simple when put like that, but it's a genuinely challenging and exciting game to play. You can't just coast your way through, you have to pay attention and engage thoroughly with what's going on at any given moment. Or at least, I did..I love the music, it's very 90's in the best possible sense			"

												I played this game obsessively when it came out, then it started getting weird crashes and I gave up. However, I'm glad that seems to have all been fixed. It's a great game for completionists, you can find yourself doing the same level multiple times to get that 100%, and it feels really rewarding when you do.			"
