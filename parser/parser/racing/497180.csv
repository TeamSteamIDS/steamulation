												You will think this game is the worst game ever in the first 10 minutes. After 10 minutes this game will become your new addiction.Spent 2 hours building a 1800bhp Nissan GTR(Btw most mods work with this version of the game). 30 minutes of gameplay and the AI decides to ram me. I was sent into a pole, the engine flew out. 10/10 I would like to see the AI raging again.EDIT: Check my screenshots to see how the game(+mods) look :).This game will regain popularity due to its steam release so expect mods for this version:)(100% compatible, some mods will crash your game due to older version). Also most mods are made in High Quality rather than game graphics :D.			"

From a junker to a Racer and you can race it not like other Garage sims.I love the Game, BUT it crashes like a Bumbercar. Having that in mind it is still as Fun as i remember But with more stuff. all this game needs is a multiplayers and a HOLE heep of Bug fixes and it will be 1Milion times better than NFS.

												Ah yes, the great series, Street Legal. I remember this game back in the day when it was released. It was such a great game back then! Here's my review on Street Legal Racing: Redline v2.3.1 (As of 8/9/2016)Short Review-PROS:*Great car customization (In-depth engine, suspension, & car body building)*Many different races to choose from, whether its track, drag, or street racing (or even demolition derby)*Good soft body physics*Decently sized city to roam around inCONS:*Has a big problem of crashing alot (it has crashed a total of 13 times in the 4.1 hours I've played it)*̶N̶o̶ ̶s̶u̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶s̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶m̶ ̶v̶e̶r̶s̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶T̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶m̶a̶d̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶e̶x̶c̶e̶p̶t̶i̶o̶n̶a̶l̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶d̶a̶y̶;̶ ̶e̶v̶e̶n̶ ̶m̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶s̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶w̶a̶s̶ ̶a̶l̶r̶e̶a̶d̶y̶.̶ ̶(The new devs should either add the Steam Workshop, o̶r̶ ̶m̶o̶d̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶)̶*Removed cheats. (I have no idea why the new devs removed the cheats. It was nice to be able to make a quick/cool build and go and race. They NEED to add the cheats back in ASAP!)*Ok-ish physics (I get that its an old game running on an old engine)*Outdated graphics (Again, I get that its an old game)Conclusion:Even though it may look like the cons over-weigh the pros, they don't. This game is a great game to pick up (especially for the sale its on right now at $5.94). It truly is not a waste of money. This game has a great deal of customization to it, like no other game yet today. This game was my childhood, and I love it so much. It really brings back good memories. If these new devs could update the game a little more & polish it up a bit more, I bet even more people would flock to this game. I reccomend this game to anyone & everyone that likes cars &/or racing games. Its truly a great experience!My Rating  8.5/10  (As of 8/9/2016)			"

												I would argue that this is one of the better Racing Games on Steam. I've been playing this series on and off for quit e a long time, and it's great to see some new life being brought to it. Decent driving physics matched with an adjustable difficulty make for a really good overall experience. Plenty of content, a little bit of a grind, but from Road Racing on purpose built circuits, Drag Racing against others on the streets at night, putting together a vehicle from a great assortment of parts, fine tuning the engine to perfection; It's all enjoyable to some degree. Be warned that there are a few bugs; However, the community behind this game is one of the strongest you'll find.A must have if you're an Automotive Enthusiast of any kind. I'm sure you'll get your Money's worth.			"

												It's as good as a heavily modified 13 year old cult classic game is going to be. Very glitchy, crashes more then you'd like, but I can't name a rice 'n race game with the sort of car building/modding experience as you get in the Street Legal series. Except maybe that failed Kickstarter for a successor by the same company. Ah well.What I'm more interested in is if SLRR 2.3.1 will still be on the store in a week's time. I'm going to assume they have some sort of deal with Invictus if they're going to monetise a mod of their game, as old as it is. Even without that, this version's still a legal minefield. Music I wonder if they've got the rights to use. Many, many real brand logos (other then the ones included in the original game) throughout game pictures and usable by the player. Meme faces as decals (Important when the Trollface meme creator is able to get it's likeness pulled from PAYDAY 1 and 2). For some reason you can put the red Angry Bird on your car as a decal, I wouldn't know why you'd want to but you can. Real life circuits in the all-new Amateur events mode. Hell, the Flatout destruction derby arena was ripped to be used for the derby events. At least the 'base' game doesn't come with real cars, only the vague likenesses offered by both SL and SLRR.It all seems to point to a group of talented modders who had no idea what they're getting into by slapping a price tag on a community mod and getting it up on the Steam store.

												SO! Let's get right to the point. Yes, the game's old, and out dated, and fake cars, yada yada yada.Sure it crashes, sure it's got bugs.But all in all? I recommend it. You can't play Forza or Granturismo, and buy a chassis, chose your suspension parts, engine heads, pistons, turbos and super chargers, and build a car that you want.Oh, and wreck it five seconds after you're done building it. Protip: Alt+F4 is your friend!I've never played a racing game that lets you do what SLRR does, and I've been playing Racing games since Ridge Racer in 1993.			"

												Have you ever wanted to buy a dirt cheap hatchback from that sketchy down the street car dealer and put your money, time, and effort into that car to make it into the coolest race car on the block? This game is for you. The game has an insane amount of customization, damn good physics for a 10+ year old game, heightened sense of realism wwhen racing due to the constant fear of crashing and having to repair the car you worked hours on just to build from the ground up, and best of all the mod community for this game is insanely large with tons of mods for this particular game (not on steam workshop, however). Youre racing and happen to crash into a tree? Prepare to take off that fender, that door, replace the headlight, inspect your engine for damaged parts, replace the cracked windshield, buy new rims, tires etc. Still want to crash? Nope. Just like real life, in a way. That being said, even if you dont crash your car, this game crashes itself. Often. It is most likely the most unstable game i have ever played. Bugs left and right, almost feels unfinished in a way. Does that stop me from loving this game? Hell no. Just save VERY often and be prepared at any moment for it to crash. Great game for the hardcore racing fan, a must buy for any racing game fans and/or mechanic game fans. Just search for SLRR mods and you will see why this game is still active after all this time.

												13 year  old game that has in some shape or form been availible for free since 2006. This basically a mash up of mods almost as old as the game it self. So what they have done is taken and thrown it up on steam for $10 to make money of it. It's still notoriously buggy. Still frequently crashes, and built of a game engine released in the late 90s. For an old bargin bin/  Totino's Pizz Roll Box game it refuses to die despite the fact it has always been a buggy unstable mess. Seriously if people had supported this game this much when it was first released it would've actaully been one of top ten games of all time. Unfortunately is has suffered from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer, and greedy ♥♥♥ publisher since it's inception so it's just that one poorly made game that refuses to die. Note: Image Code isn't the original developer.			"

												If your looking for a game that allowes you to build a car from the chassis up and includes racing the car youv built then this is highley recommended. You get a car either brand new or used and you repair, tune, replace and race it on the streets until your career as a street racer gets you in on the more bad ♥♥♥ race tracks and championships. You get a open world to drive around and challenge other racers, you can participate in already made street races or lay back and watch the already racing people to see which car will win. Get chased by cops and crash or speed off to victory depending on your car and how you built it. Watch out on money though because it disapears fast. I found this game about a month ago and its educational, i new nothing about cars and now i know a small enough amount to build a simple engine in game. i couldnt do non of this in real life but the more you play the more you learn on how an engine is built and what goes were. Its simple, if you enjoy building, racing, costomzing, free roaming, crashing, repairing and diagnosing vehicles then i highley recommend this. In my opinion this is an old but amazing game that is better than most vehicle games to date. Not graphically but gameplay wise. With some simple work this could be a game to surpass metal gear (meme)Not only am i up for supporting this game to make it into a spectacular mechanic simulater 2 but im happy to play it as it is. Please for the love of god someone invest in this game and get a dev team working on it that knows their ♥♥♥♥ and can give us a huge veriety of vehicles to choose from aswell as improve the game graphically. This has so much potential! p.s. just fkn buy the game already. its worth it if your a vehicle enthusiest or not.			"

												This is a fairly in depth game. It goes as far as having to replace the smaller parts like a gearbox. While it maybe in depth, its a really glitchy game. My experiences, I cant start a race. Im stuck with a low end ricer. The game crashed only once for me. And they are removing some of the bugs. Now, is it worth the price? Maybe wait until they work out more bugs. But it is a low price game and I have played worse. So if you like tuning, this game is good for you.			"

												The game is quite old. It was released in 2003 by Invictus Games. Invictus Games finally named it abandonedware and moved on. Imagecode managed to revive the game and put it on steam. Even till this day, They slowly update this game. What makes it unique is that this is a game using an engine from the late 1990s and was released in 2003, but is still being updated as of 2017.The game is quite fun with tons of tuning and racing. You can tune up a car and take it to a street race, drag race, or another racing event. Career mode can be challenging as you have little funds to buy a functioning car and start racing. If you accidentally crash, the effects can be devastating. You will lose parts and your chassis will become mangled up. And worse yet, crash damage is permanent unless repaired with money. Once you get enough cash and a good car, you can fine-tune your car and decorate it with your heart's desire.The game also uses workshop integration as well as having a large modding community online. There are thousands of mods that add cosmetics, performance parts, cars, and even new tracks.Sadly, the game is NOT stable. Crashes are more than common and can lead to deletion of progress. Every button click makes you cross your fingers in hope that the game wont crash. But luckily, the game is still being updated and patches are still rolling out.Pros:+Classic+Still indev+Indepth tuning+Racing+Challenging+Workshop integration and mods.Cons:-Unstable9/10			"

												I remember playing old versions of this game for hours on end as a kid, and the modding community for it was amazing! Really exited that this game made it to steam! Playing on a single gpu y510p and get 40-50 fps during nightime races at 1080p. Resolutuion only seems to save for 1 game boot (not a huge issue, just have to launch twice each time I go on). Don't get this game if you're strickly biasing it off graphics and gameplay. The graphics are outdated and the game does have it's issues, but if you're a car lover you'll definitely learn to live with them. (I have only experienced 1 crash that effected my gameplay, but I was in the garage and my progress saved anyways).  The graphics and glitches aren't that bad, the game is very playable in it's current state. This is truely the best game available that lets you fully tune & build your own car collection. I highly recommend picking up this game, it's only the price of a lunch, and it will provide countless hours of building/tunning/customizing/racing/ect. And with all the mods available, you truely wont ever run out of content.EDIT: Nominated this game for ""The “Test of Time” Award"", it really deserves it. Played this game when I was a kid and enjoyed it, playing it now and still enjoying it. Can't wait for the future updates that are to come! :)			"

												Plus points first...This offers a level of customisation I haven't seen in any other street racing game. For example, you don't just upgrade a stage 1 engine to a stage 2 engine. You buy individual engine components and assemble them. In the right order. Do you know the optimal air/fuel ratio for a specific type of fuel and engine configuration? You'll need to find out if you want to get the best from your car. What spring rate is best for the suspension setup you have and the intended use of the car? What shock absorber settings? It really is that detailed and it has a strong effect on how a car handles.There's a Roguelike philosophy in this game, in that game over is game over. I had to restart half a dozen times. You start with only one car. If it's damaged and you can't afford to repair it to a working state, game over. Start again. That will probably happen to you because damage is heavy. You're not going to get away with minor damage after clipping a post at 60 mph. Angry or incompetent AI opponents might well ram you. You won $1000 in the race...and they rammed you into a lampost, causing $5000 of non-cosmetic damage. You only have $2400? Game over, start again. And now the negative points:Bugs. The developer of this new version is doing a good job, but they were starting from a game that had more bugs than a square mile of the Amazon rainforest. There are still a lot of bugs (this is true for build 920, the latest build at the moment). Some are irritating. Some are gamebreaking. Some are odd (e.g. on my PC fullscreen is currently effectively broken because the framerate is so low, but windowed mode at the same settings can reach hundreds of FPS)Many of the car parts aren't fully described. This matters because of the depth of customisation. For example, which V6 engine block is best? No way of telling without buying each one and building a complete engine from it, because none of the blocks have any description.The way testing is set up has some flaws. Drag racing is a big part of the game. There's a test track with a drag strip. So far so good. What's not so good is that you have to exit the garage, drive around the outer ring circuit a while and turn onto the drag strip to make a pass and you can't make any adjustments to the car on the test track. So tuning your setup to optimise your drag racing quickly becomes very irritating. Change one front suspension setting...exit garage...drive around ring...make a pass...return to garage...change the setting again...exit garage...drive around ring...make a pass...return to garage...etc. By the way, if you try the mile time on the test track with all but the slowest cars you will run out of track before you can brake and you will ram a wall and you will do a lot of damage, probably destroying your engine. That was the cause of one of my forced game restarts.Bugs. So bugged that it's worth mentioning twice. This is not a finished game (and it's clearly stated as being unfinished and unstable).But I've still enjoyed it for dozens of hours (I usually play offline, so my time on record is a small part of my actual playtime) and I still recommend it despite the bugs and the rubbish testing setup and the bugs and the bugs. There really are a lot of bugs.Imagine a beautiful piece of complex jewellery that has been dug out of the remains of a medieval sewer. A curator is carefully cleaning and restoring it and that will take time. You can see the quality of the piece even though it's still pretty badly encrusted with the dried faeces that is being painstakingly removed. That's SLRR at the moment.			"

												Best racing game on steam.I have restarted the career mode over ten times because of crashing my car.I got rich then bought a wrx type car for lots of money. I pimped it out and slapped it with playboy decals. All of that took 1 1/2 hours. I then drove it for 5 minutes and totaled it.Also the people who say it crashes alot are wrong i played for 2 1/2 hours straight and it did not crash once (i mean the game not my cars).After a while the game decided to neck its self and forget all of my cars, but left my money and my level. But I geuss its just like getting robbed.Most realistic game ever.10/10			"

												I totally recommend this game to anyone who loves customization in car games. Main problems include dumbass AI that always steer into you(atleast in my case), random crashes, sketchy driving physics, and rather steep learning curve if you don't know about cars. BUT, You start out with nothing and $20,000 to spend. Most cars you'll find will be rather crap, but if you drive right and spend right you'll end up with a beast of a machine. The paint booth deserves the most mention, though the decals are rather low res the paint aspect is really detailed. Overall I recommend this game if you really love modding cars. Especially for 8 bucks.			"

												1st off i'l start by saying this game is AWESOME and fun to play but.....That is when it plays , this game is soooooooo unstable and it feels like i am playing a cracked version . i mean ca'mon , it's on steam and the game crashes every few minutes.  with all the Computer smart people out there , there really is no reason this game should crash as much as this one does. The PROS are the city feels real-ish and the AI is fun too , the cops chase you and you can totally build a car from the groud up and then total that car and rebuild it. The CONS are that the game needs a Serious bug fix and better optimizing. The game NEEDS to be updated to a 64bit . It runs in 32Bit and as low as 16 Bit. If these Dev's fix this game , i will re-write this review and make nice with my words , but as it stands now , i cannot recommend this game in it's current state. I really Want to give this a thumbs up  , but i cannot .			"

												Back many years ago I actually got this game from a box of cereal. Back then my box of curcuits I called a computer wasnt even advanced enough to handle the programming of a toaster much less this game. But I had always envisioned a game like this that gave you complete customization of car and made it true to life enough that you order parts from a magazine (internet didnt have quite the strong presence then as it does today) and so even this was my dream racing game I never really got to play,  When I saw this in on steam my jaw hit the floor and was an instant buy. I love the improvements and the fact I can actually play it now (not really the games fault there). Looking forward to seeing this game evolve. I would give you all my monies if you decide to make a more modern version of this! Anyways thanks! Looking forward to playing! :D			"

												Somehow these modders made the game even more unstable then it already was.Just way too many flaws to be enjoyable.Pros You can tune your own car, and race it.Good mod support.Cons Game crashes all the time.The game's content is really inconsistent, quality wise.Paint booth is too small for the camera to move in.Menu freaks out in fullscreen.Settings are sometimes randomly reset to standard.Game is laggy as hell without any reason.Most of the races don't function correctly.And when the races are working, they're a walk in the park.Racers still hit you in the back after races, even after update 921.And when they do, you can't return to the garage with a crashed car, 'cause the game crashes then.If this is what they came up with after 3 years of developing a already developed game, i'm really unimpressed.It's a overglorified, unstable, overpriced mod if anything.If it wasn't for the game crashing all the time it would've been playable, at least.

 Warning	 !!! This game is still being worked on !!! The Review This game is not perfect but it is a masterpiece, The game is a arcade style racing game but it's not to arcade where you feel like you're playing  Need For Speed Underground or any similar titles. The game has many things to offer that even games made in 2016 don't offer, and one of those things are a full on car customization. Anything from changing your tries to making a full on new set of suspension, or you can go hardcore and build a car from scratch to the point were you have to buy every single small part to make you're dream car! Good Things  Open World Lot's of different cars Full on car customization Controller Support Steam Workshop Mod Support And Many More Bad Things  Really Difficult Game crashes a lot and sometimes in really bad situations Can be considered a ""grinding game"" Not for people that need the best looking games Game has sometimes customization issues The game has issue with Penalties in (Pro races) Final Verdict I would recommend this game to anyone that likes hard racing games that have lots of replay-ability and likes arcade racing games! 7/10  "

												This game is what every gearhead dreamed of, you can change engine parts by yourself (choose between a variety of pistons, or make calculations with rod lenghts to take the RC to the max), adjust camshafts timing, air/fuel ration on differents type of fuel. You can assemble any car you want, a track toy, a drag beast, a street car with lots of power.This game has a LOT of potential, i hope steam helps to get this game to a stable state, because is very unstable, i have played this game from 2005, and also have been part of different forums which modded this game a lot, but the game is worth the crashes.

												I can see the potential here. Yes, this game is still as buggy as it was back in 2003, and yes, the game still crashes a lot, but at least there's progress being made here. You have to imagine purchasing this game as a long term investment. The devs are hard at work trying to make the game more stable than it ever was and the more people buy this game, the more resources they will have to make it better.Some might say this game should be on Greenlight, but I don't agree. The game was fully released when it came out, the devs improved on it, and the game didn't go backwards so it's still a full release title. Furthermore, if this game was on Greenlight, some people might think the devs ripped the original game and just put it up for sale without doing anything, since Greenlight is hard to enforce on that aspect. With this being a full release title you can be sure it's gotten a lot of work into it and Invictus and Activision have agreed on giving the game out on Steam.Overall my verdict is that this game is and always has been the best ""Built not Bought Simulator"" out there and it's gotten a lot of improvement from the old free version. The price will definitely be worth it in the long run.			"

												As others have said, this game will eventually crash on you. I've play 4.5 hours so far though, and it only crashed once. This game is a classic; one that many may have played a long time ago. Although there is still a thriving modding community for it, I never thought it would be worth the trouble to torrent this game. Now that it is easily accessible on Steam, I am excited to put many more hours in this game. This game will seem like a terrible game at first. There is no built-in tutorial, graphics suck, and the cars drive weird, but give this game some time and it will probably grow on you. The car customization is nearly endless, and the racing is very fun. I'm very glad this game is on Steam, and I'm excited to see it develop further. PS - Although cheats are not available, you can make easy cash by going into the game's files, duplicating your cars, and then selling them. "

												I had originally written a negative review for this, seeing as it crashed and froze about every 5 minutes. After enabling compability settings (running the game in admin mode and Windows XP mode), the game now crashes significantly less. It now crashes perhaps one time in an hour, and as such I deem it playable. It is also pretty fun. Coming from someone who had never played SLRR before the Steam release, the amount of modifications you can make to the cars in this game is pretty intense. Nearly any car can become a beast with the right kind of tuning. You can tune anything down to the fuel mixture and camshaft angles, which is essentially as much tuning as anyone could really want in a casual game. The ""game"" portion of the game is somewhat lacking, however. The controls are fairly arcadey, and the races are kind of grindy.All in all, buy it if you like to tinker with engines and turbochargers and wings, for that, it is unsurpassed, perhaps beaten by Automation, however that game does not allow you to drive your creations. This game does, and while somewhat lackluster in regard to ""career"" or whatever you want to call it, it is still fun!			"

												Yo,Ima Fox   An this game is the Shiz, and its fairly stable compaired to the older generations of the game. Not to mentsion that this game is a gearhead's perfect game. Other than what the reboot could have been. But this is still an awesome game no matter its age because of its weekly updates at least at the time of the post.Anyways stop reading my Review and buy the game already because its well worth it.

												Now for some reason steam keeps saying I received this product for free (which I did not) so I am going to re write my review and the fact that I would like to redo my review because I was mad and may or may not of sorta taken out my rage on the commenters and the in the review.. .Any ways here are my personal opinions about this game.First off its old,  its a really really really old game but that doesn't really affect too much on the game. One of the really big things that affect my opinion on this game is that its stability. This game's stability is absolutely terrible and thus is why I cannot recommend this game BUT if I could run this game for 3 hours and not have it crash once instead of having it crash 12 times I would love to recommend this game. If you are one of those people who like fancy graphics you won't be very satisfied.  Secondly I really think some people don't take this game serious enough because you will need some more than basic knowledge of vehicles than the average person. In the game there isn't really a tutorial that shows you how to put engines together and if you are like me you just did stuff trial and error which is time consuming and will  give you a head each. A really big thing in this game that made me salty was the AI, the AI seems like it would go out of its way just to crash into you to give you a bad time. One of my salties moments was when I was driving my car around the city just to explore and when I was stopped at a red light the car behind me rammed into my back, pushed me into the ongoing traffic and absolutely destroyed my car that I spent so long trying to get to work. I really didn't think this game was still being developed due to its age but the devs are still going at it to this day and I appreciate that and the fact that they are trying to work out the stability issues which is good. This concludes my mixed feelings/passive aggressive review about this interesting game. "

												It's a great game, real fun. But the balance in the drag races is awful, 1 minute you can pull a win against a pretty stylish high powered street car in a cheap beater, next minute you get slapped in the chops by a hatchback when you're in a ferrari with a V10... Drag racing balance is bad and so's the prizes you get from drag races, and as for race track races, could never get into them due to the overly harsh restrictions on cars.Plus the overbundance of crashes, go into my garage happy that i just managed to peel off a victory that was close as hell, only to find out i got nothing from it because the game crapped it's pants and crashed. Whether it be mid race or going to the garage. Crashes alllll the time. And. The worst part...Settings, never save... Turning autosave off, then all of a sudden, it saved when i didn't expect it when i bashed my car into a wall and lost it, which ended the career. So... For now. I don't recommend this game. If it got more updates, more cars, crash fixes and BALANCE. Then i'd recommend. Sorry devs...---------------------------------------UPDATE--------------------------------------An update deleted my save game where i actually made some progress and to top it off it was a ""stability"" update which made the game a whole lot less stable. So. GG and seriously. Only buy this game if you got the patience of a monk and just love starting everything all over again. And again. And again...			"

												This game has the potential to be a lot of fun, but about half a dozen glaring issues makes this hard to recommend.1) There are a lot of situations that'll force you into starting a new career, the most obvious one is running out of money. Even buying the cheapest car will only leave you enough money for a few races, if you don't make headway with that you'll be out of money with no option but to start a new career.2) The game has about a 1/3 chance of crashing whenever you return to your garage from city mode and if it crashes while entering your garage your car will disappear never to be seen again. I've gone through 3 careers and had this put an end to each one before finally putting the game away. When you enter the game again you'll have all of your progress and cash but your garage will be empty and you'll be prompted to buy another car.3) Night racing scales too quickly and doesn't give you enough chances to make money before your opponents start blowing your car out of the water. I've started with the 19k sports car twice now and it'll carry me through about 4-5 races to the point where drivers start betting 4k each and after that I get pounded into the ground with (seemingly) no option to challenge weaker racers. This leaves you stuck in the position of doing track races (if you can with your car, the sports car only qualifies for like.. 2? out of 59 to begin with.)4) From what I can tell you can't jack up your car in the garage, which causes you to be unable to take certain parts off your car if you want to repair them piece by piece, this isn't a HUGE issue because there's an option to repair everything on your car, but if you have some expensive repairs and want to be selective about what you repair this could cause a problem.5) The early track races get repetitive fast and don't reward enough money to make them feel satisfying. If you start with the $17k wagon you'll qualify for a race that costs $100 to enter and rewards $500 for first place. It'll take about 3 minutes to clear, meaning you'll make roughly $1200 in about 10 minutes of racing the same track. I don't expect to be given 3k per race and have an amazing car grinding the first race, but it does make it a bit too grindy to get to a satisfying place. Also, if you plan on night racing at all, having that grind wiped away by issue #2 makes things even worse.6) The parts catalogue does little to help you in picking out parts for your car. I was thankful that it would at least tell you if you could install certain parts in your car when you went to buy them, but didn't do much to tell you what was compatible with what, and if you couldn't buy it it wouldn't tell you anything at all which makes planning for future upgrades difficult. I'd like to see some sort of part comparison later on that'll make it a bit easier to tell what's compatible with your vehicle in its current state.Those are the glaring issues I see with the game in its current state, but I did have a lot of fun before #2 became a roadblock for me. The customization has the potential to be really enjoyable, I like being able to sell off parts of my car that I don't use for a little extra cash (who needs a passenger seat or doors!?) and the painting booth seems like it could be nice as well even though I never really had the spare cash to use it. As a guy that doesn't personally have a whole lot of experience with cars I could see myself having a lot of fun with this game once it gets a bit more polished, it's pretty approachable already.

												The controls feel sloppy and tight no matter what configuration I put them in, both on keyboard and mouse and using a Logitech controller. I also feel like the starting game needs a lot of work as far as car selection, racing agenda, and tutorials.  I have yet to get a car to agree to a street race yet and I haven't been able to join any official races.  Why do I have to use the mouse to select different parts on the car? Why isn't there a useful way of showing what you have selected and what parts belong to that group? How about the whole giving you $20k to start, only offering you three cars at $19k and all three missing a tire and needing engine work? How do you expect a beginner to figure out that they need to sell useless parts to make money just to get the car moving?At least the background music sounds good and the graphics are decent...			"

												Well... I would rate it 2 and a half stars. its very odd and its realistic but its bad in these waysGearing: The AI doesnt need to shift and you do. Most cars that need manual need to be shifted as soon as the race starts.Shopping: Its not clearly stated on what section to find things. Such as Nitro, Things that lower horsepower, And some other partsStarting money: I feel the starting money is crap and should start you with 40k at the most. The reason for this is. Most cars even in joes dealership are a small big above 20k such as 20135$. Thats a bit stupid. The trucks are also to expencive			"

Sharp learning curve but once you get the hang of everything, tuning possiblities are endless. GFX are iffy at best but building crazy i4,i6,v6,v8,v10,v12,v16 cars and tuning air fuel ratios, cam timing, gear ratios, NOS, Methanol, turbo,suspension, transmission, tires, shocks and lots more is awesome.  less graphic more game!Cool new content guys.keep up the good worknever thought I would see this game again on the shelves,  was shocked to see it here and bought it right away!long live SLRR			"

(I have no idea why the new devs removed the cheats. It was nice to be able to make a quick/cool build and go and race. They NEED to add the cheats back in ASAP!)*Ok-ish physics (I get that its an old game running on an old engine)*Outdated graphics (Again, I get that its an old game)			"

												NOTE:  Before anyone says anything, i have NO mods installed. Please, fix the game.. The game is so much fun, But i cant play for more then 5 minutes without it saying ""Can not respond"" Then sometimes it crashes and sometimes it moves on after a minute or so.... But litteraly just 10 minutes ago, i was playing on my MAIN save where i have 3 layers of cars, and it crashed. I thought it was like a normal thing, BUT NO!!! EVERYTHING IS GONE!!! Every single one of the cars are gone. I went into the file and the cars are not there on the save either. I have no backup because i was not expecting ME TO LOSE MY SAVE!! Everyelse is still there, level, red garage rank, but not my cars that i have put almost 60 hours into..No, it is not my computer either. My computer is windows 10, 1060GTX graphic car, I5 Proccesor, and more..... My old computer performed this the same way.... Again, this game is alot of fun, but when i lost my cars just a few minutes ago, i am done.... I am not coming back to this game till the crashes and ""loosing cars"" glitch is gone. Im tired of seeing the loading screen more then the acctuall screen. Fix the game, you will sell more copies and have more players come back, im sure as f*ck aint coming back till its fixed. Which will most likely be never because if you devs have not listend to the fans yet, you never will. I will be sure to tell my friend not to get this meanwile he wanted it. We will spend our money in another game THAT WORKS AND DOES NOT DELETE OUR WORK!!!! If i did not have over 50 hours in this game, it would be returned and you would not have gotten any of my money. Do i recomend this, NO!!! Fix it, and it will be a perfect 5 stars. "

												I really want to love this game, I even own the original on a disk (plagued with similar issues), but even with all the work that has gone into updating and working on this game I can't recommend it.  My first hour contained two crashes, I tried to set up an X-Box controller with mixed results, the keyboard controls feel sharp and very sudden (its hard to get those right in any racing game to be fair), and when I launched the game the resolution would be wrong until I changed it and relaunched the game again but close it an re-open again and the resolution would be off again, hell even the framerate is terrible (I couldn't measure it because the game doesn't register well with MSI Afterburner or even the built-in Steam framerate counter but I know what below thirty feels like and I was getting below thirty).  It's a mess now but for a group of people trying to update I have so desperately wanted to enjoy with few bugs, crashes, and a good control scheme I am willing to keep an eye on this title as they improve the game and fix longstanding issues. As of now I have returned the game and I doubt I will be picking it up again until major improvement has gone into it.			"

												So, here's my review on Street Legal Racing: Redline v2.3.1. Be warned that this is only my subjective opinion. The product is a game with the advanced functionality of assembly / painting cars. Here, they tried their best, replace and paint can be every single detail. However, for the purchase of spare parts for our cars we need money that you can earn only in races in this very car. Take care of your car during the race, because the smaller the damage - the less money you spend on repairs.What sways the technical parameters of the game, the graphic does not look presentable for the Games in 2016, however, this oversight can be forgiven thanks to the tuning machines. The physics in the game at the level, but to the ideal is to go. What exactly does not disappoint because it is musical accompaniment.Frustrating lack of controller, with which one could play sitting on the couch, as well as trading cards and achievements. Price would like to have a little bit smaller.			"

												It crashes constantly. To be honest I have played the original and this will crashe more often. Crashes usualy occur when just driving around. The main menu is so awful. It is bad enough that it crashes but I have to navigate through those menus again to play. It's slow and if you are too fast it can glitch the menu and you can't navigate it.I had about one crash per hour, sometimes twice an hour. I don't remember having that problem with the origianl. It really needs more developement time done on the stability.Also updates ceased in middle of november and only now(in the last view days) have there been more updates.			"

												Firstly, i got gifted this game a week ago, and i can safetly say, IT SUCKS! Dont buy it.This Game is utterly unstable, almost impossible to mod ( if it doesnt crash that is ) and it just doesnt want to work.If you want SLRR but without EVERYTHING BAD ABOUT IT, get SLRR MWM Jack V2, its free, just search for it, has real cars, ALMOST NEVER CRASHES!!!! Has custom tracks, more engines, more cars and is just SO MUCH BETTER!			"

												I wouldnt buy this game until some serious optimisation work is done on it.The main reason is that this game completely destroyed my computer beyond repair. After i played the game for a while it crashed, causing a BSoD. After that my computer was totalled. And i've now had to buy a brand new computer because this game destroyed my old one.I would have hoped that (because this is an old game) some serious optimisation would have been done to make this safe for newer computers. But sadly not. I've seen let's plays and it seems to be a great game. However unless you like spending several hundreds of £££ on new hardware everytime you play it then i strongly encourage you to NOT buy this game until some serious work has been done on it.			"

												This game needs to be better optimized for PC. I have a GTX 960 with 4GB of GDDR5 ram and an AMD FX 8350 along with 32 GB of DDR3 ram. I got so much lag in the game while just driving around. My FPS was at 20 and I truned all the graphics settings down to low and still got the same results. In other games I've gotten 60 FPS with max settings. This would have been a perfect game without the lag or constant crashing!.			"

CustomizationAs much as, if not less than standard AAA racing games. So many people in the reviews mistake lots of parts on the car as customization.There is no variety in the parts. The parts are either stock for the car, stock parts from other cars, and the occasional peformance part that isn't nos or turbo. Right, pretty much the only parts that gives a decent increase in power are nos and turbos.It doesn't help that 92.5% of the parts are incompatible for your car. You'll have to mod that; even if you do, like I said, there isn't a lot of choices or variety.Yes, you can get 700HP or 900HP on hatchbacks. Haha, silly. But this is not variety in customization or fun tuning.Why is this a thing?- Are you just in the garage looking at your car's specs? Did you just start playing the game and want to look around the UI? ♥♥♥♥ you, we'll penalize you for it.This game has a time system that only stops if you are in the main menu or pause menu. The game's time keeps ticking if you are looking around in the car dealer, part shop, paint shop, etc. Not only that, but it takes time for traveling to places/tracks, installing and uninstalling parts of the car.- Did you accidently misclick and removed the entire engine? Welp, that's 50 mins wasted. Are you putting it back on again? ♥♥♥♥ you, that another 15 mins.I do not understand why the developers thought it was a good idea to penalize people for experimenting with the car and the game.Do you want me to speedrun the game or slowly take it in and appreciate it?And a bunch of other nitpicky-stuff:- Crashing early-on means goodbye to your savefile and creating a new one.- Not a way to have a selection of all cars in one go. Either you cheat or go back and forth in dealers.- Paint job system consists of paint cans that you have to manually purchase and eventually run-out. I mean, what about a normal painting system? The usual order is Choose -> Test -> Purchase. That needed no change. In this game,  Purchase -> Test -> Choose""Oh but they are all realistic!""No, that's bad game design. It's your average, 'sounds good on paper, bad in practice.' situation. At least make this an option. There's a fine line between good realism and bad realism.PositivesThe fact that the game doesn't hold your hand it simulates a realistic life of a street racer might be appealing to some. Starting out with a used FWD, getting only $1k which is barely anything for upgrading, to a collection of $250K drag monsters.All those stuff I mentioned? That also might appeal to some. Just not me though. Maybe some people like spending 80% of their gameplay in their garage and 20% racing.This is not a well-made racing game. It's good.If you want a well-thought out car game like this. Get BeamNG. Drive.Their developers are fans of this game are making their game a spiritual successor.			"

												Started the game, bought a car, went to the world and the game crashed. Reloaded, went back out and it only revved. Took it apart, put it back together, still only revved. Then I decided to just try a free run. The car completely went banana nutbutter on me, pulled a full 8000 rpm whilst accelerating from 1 to 200 in about 3 seconds. Braked for the turn, turned the wheel and crashed into a wall because the car wouldn't steer. Suffice to say, this game was not what I expected. I'd ask the devs to fix this mess, but I'm not even sure where they should start...			"

												slrr is personally my favorite racing game simply because of all the awesome costumization freedom this game gives you, sure this games's graphics aren't the best but the idea of the game shines brightly thru its rough ps2 like graphics, but as you eventually going looking for mods you'll find yourself admiring how good some these quallity car mods actually look utilizing the most out of these poor graphics. the game stilbility is stronge without mods but you'll still get some hick-ups every once in a while but with mods, crashes become more frequent especially with crappy mods but if you only keep quality mods on your game, then crahes happen significantly less.i reccomend this game just because theres no other game that can give you as much freedom as this one right now			"

												My review for the game as of build 915:This game has brought back to me the feel of nostalgia and made for hours of play time to which I still eagerly go to in the morning. When I started playing the game, you had to save often for fear of losing progress, now I play for about twenty minutes and then go to save. It still is a mild inconvience but it is only that. The devolpment team has made huge bug removal every update and the updates come failrly fast for the amount of bugs they fix. If you're on the wall about buying this game, I would say for the price, it will be a more fun expierence than Car Mechanic Simulator 2016 or Forza 6 (games I also play that relate to this). The expierences made in this game will leave you wanting more everytime you close the game.1 point for game being functional2 points for amount of content2 points for development being active in the community2 points for active updates coming often2 points for overall polishthis game gets (in my opinion) a genuine 9/10 as of September 2nd, 2016			"

												ok this is going to be a revew of this game. well i would have to say it is amazing but there is draw backs/ gliches 3 very bad ones but can be avoided glitch 1: if u drive up to your garage and press yes to enter it and your game crashes you loose all your cars u can avoid this bye driving just close unuf to garage so that it dont cost money to fast travel and crash ratio of doing this is so far 0% and if u forget this step and go near enuf so u can enter it and u remember what i said above press no to entering garage and drive away from garage about 1 to 2 miles away then press pouse and press tow to garage but now onto problom 2. if u try to do race of champs it works but after u do first race game freezes and im not sher if it due to never doing it before but i let sit about 15 to 20 min and did nothing but what worse when i closed game and restarted it all the damage from that race i had done last time and now a bad one. the ram bug: example if u in race and a ai rams u u get penalty and not the ai but how to avoid this one is u have ram the guy who is raming u off the road without getting 2 penaltys and make sher u get far away if u do this u will get away with it but would i recomend game.

												I have played this game on and off for years.  It is always a pain to set up and as such I have many various backed up configurations.  This removes all that guess work and just lets you build and race cars.  Still get some CTD, but it is worth it.  I'm so glad I stumbled upon this on steam.  If you have never played it and enjoy cars, spend your $7 on a good older game.			"

												One of the best street racing games ever made!Build up your car, cruise around, race some folks, run from the cops, smash your brand new car, rinse and repeat. I have spent countless hours on this game as a kid and it's STILL one of the best games I've ever played. Don't get me wrong...the physics kinda suck and the game itself is buggy as hell. But it's still an amazing simulation of what street racing is. Being able to build up the entire motor, suspension and body. Tuning specific parts to change how the car behaves. This game taught me what tires couldn't fit on my car, what spring rates and timing was. Mixtures of Gearhead Garage and NFS:U.Do yourself a favor and pick up this game. I promise that if you are into cars in the slightest (building them), then this game is definitely for you! Now that it's on Steam, and the Workshop is coming, I think Street Legal Racing could make an epic comeback. Join us and help bring back this gem!			"

												Before buying this you can easily download the 2.2.1 LE2MWM version off of the forums. You can test it out, but don't expect a AAA type game, it's amazing though, unlimited modding possibilities, build any car you want, with any tire size you want, with the editor you can put a V16 Twin Turbo sub 2000HP engine into a Micra. This version is quite a bit more stable and more optimised. @@@>>>Should you buy this? Yes you should, for this price, it's an amazing racer, Multiplayer is coming and it will be great, I feel it ;) "

												Christ. I was going to knock this game for its stability issues. The game does crash quite frequently. But I just can't. You rarely get games like this. And Raxat and his pals went and made it better. They took all the cars from the Original game, which is a real pain to find these days, and put them in SLRR. they overhauled the UI, made everything much cleaner and friendly. Added parts, added things to do, made the game just a much better experience. Sure, It has crashing issues but had I not recieved this for free, I would have paid the $7 bucks this game cost. I saw this and went bananas. b-a-n-a-n-a-s. I've been playing this game for years in other patches and modded varients, And it's very easy to lose time. You figure you'll hop on real quick and then you look at the clock and two hours have passed but you took a completely stock vehicle and turned it into a vicious street machine designed to tackle corners, or a drag car with huge drag radials and an engine with enough horsepower to blur the lines of reality, and thats before you squeeze the nitrous, or maybe just the down right stupid, and impossible, like cars that can rev to over 10000RPM and not bat an eye. And this game only makes it better. And this is just the base game, Theres hundreds if not thousands of mods for this game, more performance parts, your favorite car. That old Ford Pinto that your dad used to have in high school. It's all there. TLDR? Don't read this review at all. Just buy the game. Buy the game, And build.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. I haven't had it crash much at all since the last update either. After skipping ahead several days to find the perfect car at the dealer, I puchased a Supra clone for 14000. The car was well equipped with nitrous and an aftermarket hood. It also came with one headlight, one tail light, a rear bumper, and a partial suspension... under the front left. I was able to afford a full suspension and three additional wheels, and thought I was ready to race. It was about that time I realized the car had no driver seat and I was out of money. I had to sell my fancy, non matching, hood to buy a seat and go street racing. Obviously the first few racers I honked at were intimidated by my radical weight reductions but I earned enough money to go night racing. Night time drag racing is where the game really comes to life and you make some money. I built up my car to 1121hp and put massive drag tires under it without wasting money on fancy body panels because doors are for the weak. What is more exciting than body panels?... Third gear wheelies!Overall, I would say this game is well worth the money. I enjoyed that I could mess with tuning and swap out internal engine parts to squeeze all the power I could from an engine. If you don't have technical knowledge of cars, I think the game still makes things simple enough to teach you through it. I think this game can grow to have a huge following so give it a chance.

												This game is absolutley amazing I would honestly have more time devoted into it if my streeing wheel would fit onto the table I use my laptop on. Though some things that I think should be added/improved is the ability to put egines from say an inline 6 into a car that comes stock with like a Vee-10. something that should be improved is the A.I.'s ability to brake in a straight line, because when I do drag races at night (and I know I'm not the only person worried about this) I'm constanly worring about the A.I. smashing into my car and causing 2-4 times as much money I just won for beating them. All in All though this is the best game I've played in a while.			"

												So this is by far one of my most favorite games tho not stable well even the retail copy back in early 2000s wasnt 100% stable. alt tab crash, windows pops some random stuff up (like always hey you pressed shift lmao) crash but still most amazing game with so much potential its not even funny. Give it a workshop, multiplayer(yes that would be the hardest) or atleast lan ability, and consistant content and moding abilities to game and cars and well needless to say it could be a top seller but still amazing game to play and ticker with. Added new makes and models really did a good job bring it back continue to be active and this game can finally see its true potential "

												Well i used to always play the free version of the this game and i have to say i couldnt stop playing and adding mods to it untill it got to the point of where i couldnt even launch the game without it crashing. At this point i gave up with the game for a bit, but now there is this one. At first i thought this was just going be the same as all the others and crash when you try and load Valo city(cant remeber what it was called) but i was wrong this game is just like it but stabel and can run some mods but not all of them it can manly be car mods and not really engine ones for the way they have laid it out, like wise with the cars, some of them work but some make the game crash when you try to load them in the catalog. Other than that this game is the one to buy, all they need to do is make mods stable for it and make sure that the resolution and text size dosent change when you load up the game.			"

												This game to start with is slowly managing to accomplish something that many other racing-based games have not been able to fully pull off, a full in-depth modification system that expands from interior (engine and such) to exterior (spoiler, wheels, exhaust and such) and I love it for that, so I would simply recommend it for that;But the downside to that is, this game is in early access, and many early access games are know for not leaving this status, so only buy this game within reason, I would fully love for you to give the devs support, but I will expand off the previous statement to the fact that due to this game being at it's bare bones for content it may or may not reach the state in which it's a full game, as many early access games don't.-But I will stay optimistic for this game, as I would love to see more done to it, I love the very core idea that this game is following and due to that I'd hate to see something with this much potential go to waste.I would also like to state that this game is extreamly unstable as of now, with large amounts of crashes occuring within my time playing, making it near impossible to upkeep a constant game without reloading it every 10 mins, and not to mention the lost progress due to this.

												Draft review2.3.1 Made the game fun again.Before the steam release career was pretty much impossible to play. Now you can progress without cheating, you actually get to use your cars against something. Crashes are way down when comparing it to the other versions.It's frustrating at times, for example when hitting the curb absolutely destroys your vehicle or when a car pops up in front of you, similar unexpected stuff, but it's part of the charm.This version still supports mods (you can get some on gom-team) and if I'm correct the dev is working on workshop support.I would recommend installing MrSirs running gear and some wheels + tyre mod from vstancedIf you like building cars you should definetly get this.

												07-08-2016: I want to love this game, the same way I enjoy Street Legal and Racing Redline on disk version, but in the space of half an hour I've had 4 game crashes. First after a couple of minutes and selecting a car at Joe's, the other three have all been after a few minutes of driving around the city during daylight hours.I'm marking this as a negative review, for now, just in the hope that we see some stability fixes in the coming days, weeks or even months. But as it stands, on an i7-5500U / 940M laptop, it's practically unplayable.Edit 12-08-2016: Latest update has given me some much needed stability fixes, having no issues going into the city, racing, and then returning to garage.

												Before buying this you can easily download the 2.2.1 LE2MWM version off of the forums. You can test it out, but don't expect a AAA type game, it's amazing though, unlimited modding possibilities, build any car you want, with any tire size you want, with the editor you can put a V16 Twin Turbo sub 2000HP engine into a Micra. This version is quite a bit more stable and more optimised. @@@>>>Should you buy this? Yes you should, for this price, it's an amazing racer, Multiplayer is coming and it will be great, I feel it ;) "

												Ive been a fan since the very first Street Legal!!!!  Such an awesome concept, build the cars piece by piece, make your own engin combos, tune etc.  Ive played street legal racing redline for a long time, and I was super excited that it came to steam, I already owned the 2.3LE version which was someone modifying the original came to fix alot of the problems it had.  I am pleased that this steam version has updates and improvement, Demo derby, track racing etc, Its great that they are still investing in this game!  I really  hope they make a new version, maybe slightly better graphics, keep all the cars, but add more, and improve the physics, handling of the game.  A 3rd party developer attempted to make a game similar I forget the name of it, but they tried to go too crazy with too many features and the kick starter failed which stinks.  Really they just need to build off of what is here and make improvements along the way, don't add real manufacturers or car companys, just keep it simple and creative, and improve upon whats here, because this game is very special! I hope updates keep coming and they can get this game to feel like a complete polished game, they really don't need to add much more, just smooth everything out!			"

												I have played this game on and off for years.  It is always a pain to set up and as such I have many various backed up configurations.  This removes all that guess work and just lets you build and race cars.  Still get some CTD, but it is worth it.  I'm so glad I stumbled upon this on steam.  If you have never played it and enjoy cars, spend your $7 on a good older game.			"

												A mediocre, glitchy and difficult racing game. However, contains some of the best vehicle mechanics of anything to date. You could easily spend hours building and tuning a car, only to have it spin out and explode, forcing you to start over. Somehow the experience is all the more fulfilling. Mod support is excellent. A variety of mods are available, almost any car you can think of. All of these add incredible longevity to a thirteen year old game. Worth every cent.			"

												ok this is going to be a revew of this game. well i would have to say it is amazing but there is draw backs/ gliches 3 very bad ones but can be avoided glitch 1: if u drive up to your garage and press yes to enter it and your game crashes you loose all your cars u can avoid this bye driving just close unuf to garage so that it dont cost money to fast travel and crash ratio of doing this is so far 0% and if u forget this step and go near enuf so u can enter it and u remember what i said above press no to entering garage and drive away from garage about 1 to 2 miles away then press pouse and press tow to garage but now onto problom 2. if u try to do race of champs it works but after u do first race game freezes and im not sher if it due to never doing it before but i let sit about 15 to 20 min and did nothing but what worse when i closed game and restarted it all the damage from that race i had done last time and now a bad one. the ram bug: example if u in race and a ai rams u u get penalty and not the ai but how to avoid this one is u have ram the guy who is raming u off the road without getting 2 penaltys and make sher u get far away if u do this u will get away with it but would i recomend game. HELL YEA the tuning is epic and even cooler i found a one of a kind car only ten of them im not giving away name u just have to find it for yourself but a killer game for a unbeleviabley op price so stop reading reveiws and get it			"

												literally purchased this version just to give it some support :).I have been playing slrr for many years now! and have multiple versions with different content, I first ever played slrr in the early 2000's, and ever since then i have been hooked!. i honestly think that this game is the best car game ever as it has everything. customisable vehicles, damage and repairs, races. pretty much everything you want in a car game it has. I have said for many years if this game got made again with licenses for real vehicles and engines and updated physics and graphics and etc it would be on a whole new level compared to today's car games it would be untouchable!. and i just hope one day this happens because it would be so good!.But for now people will have to hope modders are able to add a tone of content like they did with 2.2.1 in the past and still people creating vehicles and engines on GOM-TEAM and Vstanced  :O.just hope this one gets some attention and some focus and the content on the workshop doesn't create bugs!.

												I only reccomend this game because its non-Steam counterpart is an amazing game. However, the Steam release suffers from lacking any of the features the community clearly wants and has made possible through mods, including custom maps, freeroam, cheats, and extra graphical options. This would be excusable if this version functioned as well as the community-made ones, however it doesn't. None of the extra options save when you load a career, the graphical settings are constantly resetting themselves, and the main menus are incredibly glitchy. All in all I would reccomend getting one of the community-made releases of this game over this one.			"

												Pretty fun game, although the driving physics are weird, it doesn't look that pretty, and the gameplay isn't that polished. It wouldn't be that good of a game if it was just a racing game, but you can change your car however you like. Want to save weight? just take some seats out. Too slow? Build a better engine. Want to go race it in the city? Go right ahead. Crashed it into a police car and destroyed everything but the chassis? Have fun rebuilding it.Do keep in mind that the game is far from polished. If you damage your car and can't repair it your run is pretty much over, you can still sell your car and get some money for a new one, but you'll be too slow to keep up. Learning how to play is difficult too if you don't look up some tutorials.The thing I like so much about this game is the fact that there's so much stuff in it. A few examples:-Drag racing (cash or pink slip)-Racing-Engine/car building-Freeroaming-Store several cars-Damage model-Police chases-1st person cameraHere are some cons listed too. Some of these can be quite game breaking but these are easily fixable-After a drag race your brakes just get slammed by the game, this can cause you to crash into your opponent or the scenery completly destroying your car ( and wasting the money won)-The police can't keep up with the higher end cars-The game launcher and settings do act quite weird (resetting resolution, tabbing out on launch, Hud numbers not where they're supposed to be (speed and gear are in the black part of the speedo and unreadable)-Some wheels not supported (G29 for example) -Dashboard speedo is extremly inaccurateThis is my first ""real"" review so criticism is appreciated.

												This game has the same engine (and some of the same devs) as Project Torque, a very popular game until it ran into legal issus. The engine is wonderful for keyboard users. Still awkward, as any keyboard will be with a racing game because of the imprecise input, but the best I have seen. That said, this game can be considered somewhere between the alpha and beta stage. Waiting to see how things turn out later would not be a bad idea, and what exists at the moment of writing this is rather limited. However, this game is going in an exciting direction using one of my all-time favorite game engines. Worth serious consideration to racing fans, but beware of bugs and unimpressive graphics for the time being.			"

												this game has been around for quite awhile and is one of my all time favs. i have put many hours into non steam versions of the game and its amazing with a ♥♥♥ load of mods. it isnt perfect but it has come a long way. i highly recommend this game if you enjoy cars and building them as much as i do. BUT the vanilla game doesnt carsh all that much anymore but the moment you add mods it does tend to crash quite often depending on what it is ur doing which you will learn very quickly but this game is without a doubt worth the buy.

												Is a rater good game but it feels like it is not ''completed'' sometimes like the crashes while trying to go to valo city using a game with workshop files during the day, other than that if you are careful at the hour of modding you can get a good game  the good part is that is still being worked on so the errors should not be a problem in the future.ps: its rather difficult at the first start because you dont have enough cash, so i do use cheats sometimes			"

												(Build925)This game has gotten so much better, stabillity is still hit or miss but it's far superior to the older versions. There are still major bugs like the resoloution reset on crash or sometimes on reset (Lol) and the crashing that can happen. Unfortuatly there are still text charactor bugs which will now go super small and unreadable in the garage and during night races so you can't select an opponant properly and have to restart.The graphics are much bettter then the original game from 2003 as the engine has been improved. But I am used to playing games with mediorcore graphics and lots of quirks, so this doesn't reeally hold me back from liking the game, even if on a GTX 1080 and 6core I7 the game can hit 40fps on medium settings in 1920x1080 (usually play games at 2k but the menu and some added assets get weird at anythng above 1920x1080) But I don't care becuase I just play at reduced settings with a mostly solid locked 96FPS on dxtory.The new night racing has made the game alot more fun as you can legitmently earn over 600K throughout a playthrough if you play it slow and build cars up with lots of prestige so people will want to race for more money. However I think it needs to some revision as cars with 700+ prestige should see more pink slip and options over 10K for bets.. but sometimes all you see is 2k, 4k or 6k.If there were a few minor complaints that the devs should try to fix it would be cameras don't stay between races and freeroam properly so unless you wanna click 100 buttons all the time you'll be stuck with the exterior chase cam. Suspention parts are too hard to remove and need something to make it easier... please. Not all engines and parts have good descriptions. The i6 engines are uesless as they are super bugged out with nonsense turbo chargers that cause like a 600hp spike in the curve stright up, every other engine in the game has more stability then this. And a few other minor problems which should be improved. Also DTM vehicles are quite rare to see in races, in shops, or even the ROC. Also the player should be able to have full control over the car after drag and ROC events so they can properly avoid poles, tress, walls, and opposing vehicles.one more thing however is I don't think the kits in shop should be a cheat but whatever, I've build all the engines in the game enough to deserve a break lol. However for suspention the kits all suck real bad. I'd love to know how to make my own kits for suspention.I would reccomend this game to people who are okay with some quirks and have the patience to learn the ins and outs, sometimes the stability isn't great when starting out. If you find the game too hard try these for game settings:-Destruction/Deformation Level (less then 33%, Even 0% it will make the damage alot more normal)-ASR just leave at 0%-ABS 0-50% your preference-Traffic 0-20%, with it off cops are no longer anything to worry about, however this does break the escape the cops gamemode.-Steering Help 50-75% This game is brutal without it all it does is just help the car go in the direction you want it to and keep it going stright, it's far from perfect and mostly will not impair your abillity to turn, unless it's set above 80%.

												I've been an SLRR fan for quite some time and I purchased this game to help and support the developers. I got into the game thinking, ""I know what SLRR is gonna be like..."" Well, I was right and wrong.If you enoyed the previous versions of SLRR (2.2.1 or 2.3.0), you'll definitely enjoy this one as well. The game still maintains SLRR's unique, in-depth, highly detailed tuning/customization. To date, it's the only racing game I've ever played that allows you to build a car from scratch. Players can purchase engine blocks, heads, pistons, connecting rods, exhausts, intakes, camshafts, crankshafts, transmissions, turbochargers, superchargers, fuel rails/types, tires, brakes, springs, shocks, anti-roll bars, seats, pedals, steering wheels, etc. and then you're left to build the whole thing yourself. The tuning possibilities are endless. And if you crash, you pay for whatever damage you've made. If you crash and lose an engine (it's bound to happen at some point, lol), you're gonna have to buy more parts to rebuild another engine.In comparison to the previous versions, this game does a lot of things better. There is a bigger variety of cars to purchase, the physics feel more solid (in my opinion), and the addition of new racing events allows players to race their vehicles on numerous amounts of racetracks, not just the streets of Valo City. Players can now also change the amount they want to wager on night races, allowing you to make some really quick cash.My only concern is the game's stability. SLRR has a reputation for being unstable. It crashes A LOT, and you may come across some glitches and bugs every now and then. The recent updates have made a lot of improvements though. If the unstability isn't a huge concern to you, I would definitely recommend this game, and to anyone who is a car enthusiast. "

												OK so i saw ddg play this game for free and tried it the major problem with the free version is it is outdated and  almost impossible to play , how ever when i first  bought this version i learned that this is way more optimized while there is still crash issues just make sure to save. If your drag racing at night and it crashes just valitdate your files untill non are missing and bam it works i like the game in general i would recommend is you can wait to upgrade your car,  BUILT NOT BOUGHT			"

												Ok. This game is one of the best racing/tuning games i've ever played. The modding support is unreal. The only downside in my own opinion is the game used to crash ALOT. Now if it does crash its every few hour and you have to try to make the game crash. So i guess a rating out of ten would be seven and a half out of ten. If the crashing was completly fixed i would give this game a ten out of ten.			"

												SLRR is a cool and fun little cheap game. That being said it acts and controls as a cheep little game. Consistently crashes for no reason. Less than satisfactory graphics and how much you are left to find out on your own is a lot. If this game were to get updates to fix this game it would be so much more enjoyable. But lots of potentiall, fun, and nice game to play.			"
