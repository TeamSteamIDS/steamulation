UPDATE: New levels are insane!

Learn how to spin! This is one of this games that are easy to play but harder to master. You control a wheel, it can spin left and right or change its size. The bigger it is... the faster it falls. The strongest + in here is the levels design itself, they are unique and fun to play. There are many tricky moments also, so in order to complete them you must try different strategies (sometimes there are several ways to finish them). If you are stuck there is possibility to try different level because you can skip them. 160 levels included + additional 75 will be released soon. "

												After playing the game for about an hour, I can definitely say it's worth buying! The game features O, a small ball which has the ability to get bigger and get smaller. By doing so you increase/decrease your mass, alowing you to gain a lot of momentum when being big, and then transforming that momentum in actual kinetic energy when your smaller. Obviously the game has way too many features for me to discuss right now, so I'll just write down the tops and tips.Tops:-Very good graphic design for a game of this genre-Non-lineair gameplay, so that the game stays fun-Challenging-Good music-Runs very smoothly-Original-Plenty of content (150 LEVELS, HOLY SH!T!!)Tips:-Perhaps implement a competitive leaderboard (I haven't seen yet, might have missed it) so people can compare their score to others-Implement multiplayer-A level editor would be awesomeI definitely recommend you to buy the game, as far as I've seen.

												Well since then the Recommand Percentage is still 100%, of course I won't destroy thatThis is the 36th positive Steam review on this gameThis is just a new game avilable for purchase on 5/12/2014, after playing it for an hour or more, I can tell you I love it. In the game, you play with a ball that just roll and roll...it's only ""skill"" is turning it own size. The first few levels are easy, but harder and harder...trust me, this game is really hard to play...it challenges your IQ...There's one thing good about this game, if you are stuck on a level, you can chooce to skip it and try other levels first instead. So you won't get bored and annoyed:)Personal Score: 8/10			"

IntroThe sharp, minimalist visuals of iO were the first thing that caught my attention when I checked out the Steam Store page. Having seen and played tons of puzzle platformer games I was asking myself if this game would introduce me to new gameplay mechanics I hadn’t witnessed or experienced before. And while we’ve certainly seen specific parts of it before in other games it does actually give us something new, and maybe even something to get excited about.GameplayHaving debuted on Ouya (a platform that everyone was excited about when it was first showcased, but once released the interest in it took a nosedive) iO never got the attention that it initially deserved. With the PC release it might still have a hard time getting any attention at all. So many games are released every week that it’s hard to get your game promoted, especially if you’re a small game developer. And it’s especially hard if it’s a fun game as well. Let there be no doubt: this is a fun game and I hope it does well, both commercially and critically.The setup is simple: get the ball to the end of the level, marked with a portal. The levels are made up of random platforms, these can be horizon and vertical, as well as diagonal. Then there are the platforms that have to be pushed out of the way and tricycles that can get you across fiery (red) platforms that will destroy your ball. Falling down or getting too high up will also destroy your ball. It’s your goal to keep the ball on or between the platforms as much as you can.But it’s not as simple as getting from A to B. Like a wise man once said; it’s the journey that’s important. And that’s exactly right. That’s because the ball has to increase or decrease in size to get through specific parts of a level. And within a few minutes you’ll learn how to speed up your ball to get to higher parts of a level but you’ll also learn how to blast off so you can jump across a gap. Not only that, but you’ll also learn how to jump, which is actually quite easy once you know exactly what to do (which is usually the case with pretty much anything these days). The keyword is ‘momentum’ which means you have to time your actions. You’ll be repeating levels over and over again because 1) you didn’t know what to do, or 2) because your timing was off. It’s usually 2) that causes the retry.There are 150 levels to complete and each one you complete can earn you a medal. Can, because taking too long won’t earn you anything but if can complete a level within several seconds or minutes (this, of course, depends on the level) you might be able to earn a bronze, silver or gold medal. The gold medal usually requires perfection. You might not notice this right from the start, but halfway through things can get hard and earning that gold medal might not be so easy anymore.The controls are easy; a controller works best here but bringing up the menu while in-game can be troublesome. I frequently pushed B to bring up the menu, but because the game wasn’t as responsive in this area as it should be it usually took a little longer. By then I was already rotating the stick and eventually was returned to the main menu or the next level. A small nitpick but still a little flaw in my book.Graphics & AudioAs I already mentioned in the first paragraph the game uses a minimalist look, meaning everything has a basic shape and there are no backgrounds or background colors. It also uses basic, neon-like, colors like red and blue. It looks pretty in motion and the core of the ball becomes fierier the faster it goes. A little detail that doesn’t add anything to the game itself, but it surely looks cool.Audio-wise it’s also very minimalist with some decent background music and basic sounds.ReplayabilityYou can play this game just for the bronze medals or you can try to finish them all with gold. In any case it should take around 5-7 hours for a quick ‘playthrough’ and for a thorough playthrough it will take you probably double that amount. That’s plenty of gameplay for a game with this price.ClosingiO (still) is a very fun, but sometimes extremely challenging, game that mixes up the genre a tiny bit. Its gameplay mechanics are solid, as are the controls, and its visuals are beautiful and relaxing. If you like to play puzzle platformers then iO is the perfect game for you. Even newcomers to the genre should have a bloody good time with it. It was a small success on Ouya, but now is the time to make it an even bigger success. Click that ‘Buy’ button, people.[Rating: 80/100]			"

												Imagine a game where the character is just a ball the whole time. A ball that isn't even bouncy and can't jump. Consider how difficult it is to implement any platforming that isn't simply clunky and awkward with such a limitation.Now let's think about 99% of platformers. How very annoying and limited would they be if they didn't allow changing directions in midair? It is completely unrealistic, yet omnipresent.I thought about these concepts a lot, and didn't believe it was possible to make a decent game with the mentioned limitations. And yet, here we have iO, and calling it decent would be a huge understatement.So yes, the character is a ball that can roll clockwise and CCW. You don't simply ""move right""; the movement happens because of friction. The ball can also shrink and grow (changing its mass) anytime. Arbitrarily changing mass and angular momentum are the only unrealistic things here; the rest is just physics.And oh how fun pure physics can be...As mentioned, rotating allows you to move using friction. The friction also applies to walls and ceilings, allowing you to do not-so-obvious things. Changing mass in mid-air while keeping the momentum lets you change the trajectory (launch yourself). The process of growing in size improves your grip, letting you speed up easier, or... climb some walls! Now, don't forget that you can only grow/shrink so much...And of course, we also get the more typical features of a physics-based game: There are moving platforms. You can push and interact with things in other ways using friction. Portals: speedy things comes in, speedy thing comes out... but what if the thing can change mass?The game is almost flawless (if you overlook occasional clipping through objects in rare cases, which doesn't affect the gameplay).Graphics are very aesthetically pleasing. Won't talk about music, because I rolled with my own.★★★★★★★★★☆			"

												iO is a clever little game with simplistic and very addictive gameplay.The goal is to get the ball into the portal. Sounds simple enough on paper, in reality its pretty tricky. You can change your size and that will determine your speed and the rate at which you gain speed, and this is essential part of the gameplay - figuring out the optimal size to achieve a task. There is no time limit on the levels ( all 150 of them !!), but medals are awarded, depending on your speed of completion - the faster, the better. About that, I would love to see a timer inside the level, but maybe that's just me.The controls are fine, I used keyboard - either WASD or the arrows. The ability to rebind tjem would be a plus, but I didn't feel the need for it at all. The music is abstract and fitting, the sound effects are not that much, but still reasonable.There is no level progression, you can start from whatever level (out of the 150) you want. There is a trial pack of levels, that plays the role of the tutorial and introduces you to the game mechanics. After that, there are still the occasional hints inside the first few levels, but the game does not hold your hand by any stretch of the imagination. After the first few straightforward levels, you'll need time to figure out the way to complete the level, and then actually execute your plan ;) It's enough to say, the game has a key to instantly reset the level - you will use it a LOT. The trial and error is the way to complete most of the levels for the first time. I really like the steam leaderboards and the ingame medals, as there is always a way to improve with these game mechanics ( it's not set in stone thing like a ""jump"" - you gradually change your size and speed, so optimal size and time to switch it, is hard to determine).The only thing I dislike about the game is, that it has the nerve the actually spin up all my hard drives before starting - typical for a KISS release, and really annoying in my opinion.With the pretty simplistic game graphics and mechanics, a level editor will be a really nice edition to the game at a later stage, allowing the community to go nuts, but for now, I think, trying to ace the 150 levels is more than enough.The huge amount of levels, steam leaderboards, steam trading cards, addictive gameplay and that price tag ... all of it leads to my wholehearted recommendation of the game!TL:DR you can check my overview video, where I complete the first level pack :

												A minimalistic puzzle platformer game where the main concept is the ability to shrink or grow your ball in order to navigate through the levels. Gameplay is fun and is broken into levels which gradually get tougher. The background music is very well done. Really easy game to learn but hard to master.

												Solid reflex-based ""platformer""/physics game. Your lone objective is to move a wheel from your start point to the goal in every stage. Your only controls are left to right movement, and being able to grow/shrink yourself for extra/less mass. The larger you are, the faster you speed up on a downward slope and vice versa - shrink as you head back up to suddenly accelerate like mad, so on. There are extra quirks (rolling on gates to force them to move, etc.)It's also hard as balls if you're going to go for golds.That's seriously it. This is a great game with consistent everything, if you screw up, it is your own dang fault, and it keeps kicking me in the teeth when I play. But I keep pounding at it.			"

												With many hours of gameplay invested, I can assure you that this game will NOT dissapoint. It is an absolutely AMAZING (and addictive) Physics based game that will test your reflexes and ability to solve puzzles! What you see is what you get, and it is as fun as it is challenging. It has many different gameplay mechanics, intential gameplay bugs to exploit, and you can even finish seemingly linear puzzles in many different ways. It will keep you trying to get those gold medals: .02 seconds of? Try again! The gameplay is intuitive to learn, and most of the mechanics are very intuitive (Though some will require some practice to get used to), and you will also spend time trying to beat puzzles through trial and error. Eventually you can form a knack for virtually any puzzle and use your experiences to beat other puzzles. Many of the longer puzzles will incorporate several different mechanics all at the same time to give you an exceptionally difficult time, though once you complete them (With a gold medal especially) it is very rewarding.This is a must buy for any puzzle, physics or skill lover.

Easy to learn, hard to master!Don't let the simplistic (yet satisfying) art style fool you!iO is an interesting puzzle platformer which is easy to learn but hard to master.The game offers a whole bunch of challenging levels in which the speed, mass, acceleration and timing, of your little ball called iO, matter a lot. (Sidenote: I've played a lot more hours of the iOS version of iO so ignore my 1.8 hrs on Steam). Fun for a wide range of players!   If you like puzzle games this game will get your brain gears crankin'. If you like platformers then playing, spinning, speeding, jumping and climbing not with a character but with a ball, will give you a nice, unique and different experience you might want to check out. If you're an achievement hunter, there's 33 of 'em to pursue.If you like beating your own or your friends records then you will find yourself playing levels over and over to find that perfect timing and the best way to complete a level.iO is definitely a game worth checking out!

iO is a nifty physics platformer that is both accessible and challenging. The simple mechanics of controlling the size and momentum of ball, coupled with well thought-out level design will keep you coming back to this little gem. As the levels get progressively harder and more complex, it never fails to keep its relaxing atmosphere with its elegant graphics and serene music.There is more to this game however than meets the eye. As you get better, you'll be able to take shortcuts by utilising the physics properties of the ball. With a little practise, the skills are consistently executable, making this a very fair game. Players can keep improving their times by taking different routes which ultimately makes this a great game for speedrunners and experienced gamers alike. The levels are diverse, have a great difficulty curve by slowly introducing new elements and embody a speck of the puzzle genre.Whether you are looking for a relaxing game you can play for a short 10-20 minutes, or are one of those who dont settle for silver, if you are into simplicity, elegance and enjoy platformers, this very affordable game is worth a try.

												This is one of those games where completing a level feels very satisfying and motivating to keep going. It requires you to develope a good amount of skill with the basic concepts provided as you succeed in more and more of the challenges. Figuring out the puzzle of the basic layout of the level isn't the hard part here. It is more about understanding the consequences of shrinking and growing (and thus changing mass) at an instant applied to a rolling object while the rest of everyday physics is kept the same. By doing so you get a feeling of how momentum is connected to mass and how it acts on the velocity of an object. The level design incorporates these new mechanices in some surprising ways. And you can test if you truly master the mechanics by aiming for the optional medal rewards that are given for beating a stage within a time limit.Ultimately I can recommend this game to all who seek a good challenge and don't get frustrated all too easily. Even for the latter kind there is an option to skip levels and return to them at later time. The only negative thing about this game is perhaps that it sometimes doesn't keep up the level of challenge and throws in a couple of trivial puzzles every now and then at the later stages.			"

You control a wheel and uses its ability to shrink and grow to climb walls, drive through loops and do many other cool tricks to guide your way through the level. You have 225 levels to go through and the difficulty increases for each stage. It's one of those games where you just replay the same level 100 times to get the best time as possible. And with the leaderboards to compare your times with other players, it makes you want to improve your time even more. For the price its at now, you'll get a fun and addicitive game that you will enjoy a lot.			"

												Play as a mechanically articulated, tesselated wheel structure configured for variable-radius.  From an unseen, orthogonal mechanical linkage providing 2 degrees of freedom, an axial mount point delivers tubes for pneumatic injection of liquid gallium into one of two systems; the segmented, reinflatable, toroid vesicle which provides internal pressure to adjust the radius of the structure with the side effect of adding mass, or to the torque converter for tangential acceleration of the entire mechanism in unison.  Coupling these controlled mechanical forces with an exceptionally high friction coefficient around the circumference of the mechanism permits an operator to explore seldom studied facets of Lagrangian physics with a focus on momentum and Coriolis effect.

												Nice puzzle game, good entertainment for the price. The puzzles where well thought out.It's based around a simple premise: you are a ball that can spin around it's own axis, and you can change your size (and with it your weight). For example, this allows you to go from heavy to light (so you can launch yourself) or from small to big (to hold on to the walls).They take this one mechanism and really explore what you can do with it. It reminded me of Portal, where you basically have one mechanism, and the game is playing with that mechanism in many ways. This game does that with a size-changing ball.I feel the difficulty was good. Most levels I got before they got frustrating, but it was never easy to get a gold medal.The graphics look good, and the game ran fast.The only problems I had were with the controls. For one thing I never managed to get my XBOX (original) controller to play nice on linux (I haven't tried on windows).The other problem I had only happened in 3 levels with complex manouvering while using a USB keyboard. It seemed like the controlls stopped working part way through. I got a PS2 keyboard and this stopped. I think it might be due to n-key rollover. This means those three levels could be frustrating if you are playing with a USB keyboard.Besides those three levels, I had no problem using the USB keyboard.iO took a fun idea and used it well, I look forward to the developers next game.

												This is not a game you play for hours and hours until your mom tells you to go to bed. This is not a game you skip school or work for. This is the game you play when you are sick of all the triple A titles and just want a simple, challenging and fun puzzle platformer. And that's what this game is perfect for.It is easy to pick up and hard to master. With over 150 levels, leaderboards, committed developers and upcoming DLC this is a game worth the price. "

												Fabulous! I love this game so much. It's like a super fun action fictional physics game. It follows the law of conservation of momentum (linear and angular) but it ignores conservation of mass... This is such a brilliant way to make a college level Physics 1 student get confused to failure, but at least it was super fun in the way... By the way, I purchased this game on my iPad 2 and iphone 4 and it works terribly! so play on a real computer or lastest models of iPhone/iPad only.			"

												Fun game. Like the physics based platforming and puzzle solving. The shrinking and growing mechanic was fun and inventive. Sometimes the mechanics didn't seem to work, like you are supposed to grow when going down and shrink when going up, but shrinking actually slowed me down sometimes and growing slowed me down somtimes, so more consistency could have been nice. Also greater variety in mechanics with more abilities, and different backgrounds that weren't just neon blue and had different thinks and objects in them to get around. Some levels were just annoying levels that forced you to get multiple perfect jumps or climb some vertical wall to beat it, and that was it, as opposed to doing a bunch of different things, so it required a lot of repetition. More gameplay like night sky could have been fun. Also more contraptions to drive would be nice, as the wheel one didn't seem to move as fast as it should for me rolling in it. Great that the developer is adding more levels in updates, although annoying he is just adding ""impossible levels"" which means they require you to be perfect a bunch and repeat things. Still it was fun, a much better version of the sh!t game called ""color bind"". I enjoyed it, and there are a lot of levels, although many are short. 8/10.			"

												iO is a criminally underrepresented game here on Steam. I never thought a puzzle/platformer/racer with no jump button would be at all enjoyable, but I was wrong. The physics are clever and slightly exploitable, the level design is clean and simple, the controls are functional, and the soundtrack is soothing, to say the least. Anyone interested in any kind of platform or puzzle game should definitely pick this up. Now, if there was Steam Workshop support with custom levels, that woud just make it even better. Let's hope that's in the pipeline somewhere!			"

												Unfortunately the game is not good. The main reason is it's mechanic, but not in the sence of itself, rather than in the impact it has on the controls. The ball is spinning. And therefore it has angular momentum which is extremely hard to control and especially frustrating to predict it's influence after making a move, For example, you spin up, jump and when you land the momentum screws your controls heavily.Otherwise the game is nice and interesting.

												I feel like the core concept of this game is good, but it's execution, maybe not really.The individual level ratings need to be balanced. To some, this may just be a very minor thing, but I am very much a completionist. level 8 of the tutorial seems insane to get gold on to me, and getting frustrated to the point of almost ragequitting in the last level of the tutorial to get gold, isn't a good sign. after this I tried some of the levels in the first level pack. It's like another tutorial. Kind of odd game design there, they put a tutorial in some of the levels after the tutorial, and they basically repeat the things they already said. I again, found myself extremely frustrated at some of the first 10 levels, if the game got much harder then that, I have no idea how anyone would really like this game that much.Another issue are the controls. For me, at least, the controls feel really awkward. things like shrinking, would have been nicer if you shrunk, that the ball actually got put on the ground, but instead it shrink to the middle off the ball, which was one of the most frustrating things when dealing with level 8 of the tutorial. it was difficult just to pass that level.This also isn't a puzzle game. a lot of people say it is, but it really is not.other then that, there are a few minor things that can get annoying, like portals not being colour-coded, or the long-♥♥♥ animation you can't skip at the end of a level.In the trailer they mention crafty mechanics, don't expect too much crafty mechanics. I have looked in a bunch of later levels and they really don't introduce that much new things. it's pretty much just grow, shrink, and other things will do things depending on size.TL;DR needs balancing, controls bad, lots of minor problems, not really anything unique past the core concept.
