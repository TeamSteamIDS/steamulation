								""Gaijin Entertainment"" yeah i'm done with this ""game"" ( more like cash cow ).... this game should be F2P in the state it's in for Early Access, and before you people say, ""but they need money to make the game"" yeah ♥♥♥♥ them, go look at the other games they've made and you'll see they try to bleed the live out of the player's and their wallet. sure they come up with great idea's but they put a HEAVY price tag on it. look all i can say is this game feels bad(controls and reaction time of the death machines you drive), the interface is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥for $30USD,  what are you ♥♥♥♥ing nintendo. making an account is a pain if you make one or have one (gajin account) it HAS to link to your steam account before you login and if you just click sign with steam you'll face and issue if you try to use your gijin account to login. ""Gaijin Entertainment"" look at the feedback from their other games and you'll see what type of company they are but then again who knows maybe hell will freeze over.... now wheres that refund button			"

								So there's a lot of misinformation about this game circulating around about P2W.  It may be because of something from prior to the steam release.  Let me explain why this is nonsense.  You can unlock any part and craft it without spending money.  You can make currency by selling parts you make or selling scrap (used to make parts).  You can buy parts and vehicles but you're going to be stuck with players who match your vehicle's rating.  So it's not like you can buy your way to better equipement than who you're playing against, you can just sort of skip the grind to a small extent.As for gameplay this game is sort of arcadey driving with pretty good physics, reminds me of driving a warthog in Halo, except steering is independent of the camera.  Rounds tend to be fairly short and you can go from one to the other very quickly.  The vehicle customization gives you a lot of freedom and there appears to be a pretty large diversity of weapons 30$ is a bit steep but the game is very very fun.  I'd say it's a must buy for 20$, and I'd still recommend it at 30$, but if that's too much for you check back later.			"

								This game is a lot of fun, and I've played it a good amount but... I can't recommend it and it's all because of the jesus god horrible awful support.If you have a problem  - any kind of problem and you contact support they will tell you 1) You can't be helped (who the f- says this?)2) It's your fault and you have to fix it (I am completely not kidding - son's account was locked and somehow, our fault)3) they will come at you with incorrect facts and refuse to cooperate.I bought my son a copy of the game, he is 6 - he tried to play it and they locked his account and claimed that he had refunded the game on steam.  He's never owned the game on steam.  I sent them a purchase history proving he's never owned the game on steam.  3 days of back and forth with their tech support due to errors on their system.My issues are even dumber.  My steam account and game account aren't properly linked and support says ""can't fix it.""It's just horrible.  Pathetic.			"

								After a warning by the police force for duc taping a shotgun to the top of my car, I though I had done with life. I want to drive around ramming other people and shooting them while driving. Apparently that isnt ""legal"" or ""safe"". All i crave is to breath the smell of burning fuel and gun powder while I push the pedal to the metal.I still cant do that, but this is damn well the closest thing. You literally build a car with gun, shoot other cars, get scrap and build better parts. The game progresses quite fast and within like 15 mins of playing I already had unlocked another colour to paint my car and new weapons.The game is small in size and runs great on a computer a few years old.If you want to power slide aroung blowing machine gun rounds into other players with a car you designed yourself with parts you unlocked and built yourself, then this is the game for you. You unlock scrap (used to build parts) and random parts/ weapons by finishing a rounnd. Rounds only last like 3, adrenaline pumped, mins on average, so it doesnt take long to build your dream car... that is, if you dream of living in Mad max or post apocolypse!!			"

								Interstate '76, Twisted Metal, Robocraft, and MadMax... A nice blend.I wouldn't classify this game as 'pay to win' at the moment. It's more along the lines of a 'pay to progress' game. There's far too much whining when it comes to this subject and the game.Please consider the following: Total vehicle parts or the number of parts you can use in order to build a vehicle is based upon your level as a player. Matchmaking is based upon your vehicle's power score. Weapons and part count will ultimately affect your power score, thus pitting you against people within the same overall tier. You don't need a power score of 4,000 in order to enjoy the game. You don't need rare weapons in order to win. The game can be grindy. However, it's a lot of fun. If your goal is to stay within a certain power score range, say around 2,000, you will undoubtedly spend hours tweaking your rig. This is one of my favorite parts of the game. I may lose 3-4 matches. But then I go back to the drawing board. I've spent a good amount on this game. I believe I've purchased all but 1 of the packages / dlc. I still end up trying to build an effective scouting vehicle with enough fire power to survive.			"

								My new addiction.With Crossout coming to Steam i decided to give it a try after following the game for some time now.And yes, i got a new addiction.What a fun game to play.After the few intial battles i found myself building my first vehicle and my second and my third, refining and fine-tuning them.Using them in battle is brilliant, fast paced action which looks great graphicly and runs smooth!The perks you unlock with leveling up makes things difficult: Should i keep leveling or build a new and better vehicle to do even better in the missions and raids.There is even crafting ingame, creating your own items with things you earn while playing or sell/buy items on the market.So there is more to this game then just a ""Shooter on wheels""I like the way the matchmaker works in this game.Once you finish a battle it automaticly selects another match for you unless you chose to go back to the garage. Nifty little feature :)It is nice to able able to create your own special vehicle after all the action of the missions and raids. I spend several hours already building and testing the strangest machines and i like the endless possibilities you got with only your imagination as a limit.On the downside there is the fact that my wife wanted to play it aswell and she liked it so much she now got her own game, so there goes my love-life :/I realy can recommend this game if you like to build vehicles, crafting items and take them into battle.But don't let the rest of the family see you playing it because before you know it they all want to play it :p			"

								It's like Vigalante 8 meets Robo Craft Meets Twisted Metal Meets Battlefield vehicle experience. Graphics can be improved I hope but it's probably a game meant for a lot of hardware to get a big player base. It's early access to play the Free to Play version. I don't mind maybe they will throw the early adopters a bone when it launches and give us some awesome things. Either way if you like the games I described you will like this. There are skills to  be had. It's not like Robot Craft in a lot of ways which is good!			"

								Hello,If you are looking for a creative vehicle building/battling game i would like to tell you, You will not be let down by this game and here are my reasons.Pros:-The game only limits you based on level/rank you can build ANYTHING you want however it may not always be successful in battle-The game runs on computers from 10 years ago.-You are rewarded after every match if you win-It is relatively easy to build a very successful vehicle.Cons:-It is an early access game and is subject to LARGE and annoying changed at any moment-Players entering a higher rank/powerscore will initially suffer from very many losses due to a weapon shift between high end tier and low end "

								I do recommand this game, quite fun and easy to build the ""car"" of your dream. It's still EA so, at highter level you'll find yourself fighting against vet players who allready have everything unlocked, but still, even with low level parts you can win a game by yourself, it's all about strat and not being caught by the ennemy team at the wrong moment.I do enjoyed my first 35h of building and fighting with my strange design.Surprise your ennemy with a moving wall filled with medium turret is still the best thing i've done so far.Looking to unlock futher components even is it's take ages to do so.TopCake/10Do try it and replace ingame braindead bots.

								Sure the handling is a bit wonkey, and a few things need their balancing. I came into this purchase with the notation that I'd only play for enough time to be eligable for refund after the whole No Man's Lie Fiasco; i even debated not purchasing due to the fact that Crossout will be a future free to play game, but I've needed something to fill that void in my heart that NMS left there to rot. I digress though; this game is everything it is dreamed to be, and creativity it truly key.You build your own death machine, piece by piece, and either blast your way to glory or watch yourself get demolished piece by piece. Truly a masterpiece; no more robocraft blocks making you feel like a mere child; here we have real engines of destruction that Mad Max has brought us to love over the decades.Had a bit of a world of tanks grind about it; but every match is so invigorating that you get lost in the sheer fact that your turning your victims into smoldering bits of scrap metal. Precision is key, you want to dismantle their tracks/wheels and leave them immobilized while you rain cannon hellfire on their head? Or would you rather charge them full-bore with deadly shotguns, dismantling their weapons armaments leaving them high and dry asking themselves why? Better yet, pimp out a full on charging stallion to melee your enemy into smitherines. As i've said, imagination here is the key and the possibilities are endless.I fully condone supporting this game in its early stages; for only greatness shall come in the future I do hope.FOR VALHALLA! 10/10			"

								For the longest time I've dreamed of a game exactly like this. A build it, drive it, destroy everything that moves game. I envisioned a game that rewarded creative players by allowing them to mod their vehicle of war with whatever parts they could muster. This game is that and so much more. Of course, for sly hands, you can always purchase a ""gently used"" Mammoth Cannon or two from the Black Market. Better yet, this game is only Early Access at the moment, so it can only get better. It is a mashup of Twisted Metal, Mad Max, and Robocraft. And mashup, you will.10/10 would mashup KewtKuddlyKitten's war rig with my quad Mammoth cannons again..			"

								Love this game. Super happy with that's there already. I love how flexible the build system is. When you play PvP, everyone has drastically different designs. No one design is proving ultra effective yet. And I love that they leverage community built vehicles for use as bosses in co-op raids. It's super fun to build vehicles and experiment with different designs. Rounds are quick. Feels a lot like rounds of Counter-Strike. I feel like the progression system moves at a good pace. I earn a lot of items and scrap metal. Very happy with the purchase and I hope the game does really well so the studio can continue to support and develop the title.			"

								This game is really fun. The action is fast paced and the matches don't last so long that if you die early on you have to spectate forever until the next match. I see a lot of reviews saying it is pay to win. As someone who has bought 3 of the different ""packs"" for the game let me tell you that it is not. Even the $60 immortal warrior pack gives you no real advantage in game. As a matter of fact that tank is sub par. The matchmaking uses a point system based on how powerful your vehicle is. Even players with significantly more powerful weapons than you can easily be taken out with smart play. Even the most powerful purple and orange weapons can simply be blown off by anyone. Just aim people! Anyway awesome game give it a shot.			"

								Good: The Game and most gameplay aspects. It plays similar to robocraft in that you  have a tun of customization on your vehicle design, and then take it into combat to fight others. The game has a workable economy and good infrastructure for crafters/marketeers. The crafting and economy work very similarly to War Frame if you have played that. Bad: moderation is a joke. They have GM's who literally sit in chat to do 2 things1)Monitor language, I'm not joking, in 2016, with a chat filter, they have someone on staff nearly 24/7 just to look for F-Bombs... and 2) Mute anyone dissenting about their game. Any time someone mentions pay to win, complains about matchmaking, etc, the GM's will tell them to stop talking about it and post on the forum. -----------I'm sorry but gestapo tactics are ENTIRELY unacceptable. Every great game I've ever played had people complaining about it in chat. These guys should be taking notes, and causing positive community interaction. Instead they are going on little nerd spasm control episodes and mute/banning people who they don't agree with and don't ""respect their authority"" (yeah, thats a quote from their GM in chat, I wish I was ♥♥♥♥ing joking)			"

								This is a weird one for me, all the things i don't like about the game aren't really game.I love the concept, the graphics are nice, the fighting is fun until you get a little higher in level. Then its prsion shower time and oh look is that your soap on the ground? The pay to win-ness becomes painfully apparent when you get to around 4000 power score and you start encountering players who are 4 times your level and/or have dumped more cash into the game. The matchmaking is utter garbage, a friend and i (friended in the game no less) repeatedly found orselves against eachother, and when grouped in game matches took so long to start that for the first day we thought it was a broken mechanic and didn't work. This game so obviously seeks to heavily pressure its players into spending more money its not even subtle. It is so very difficult to make money in the game , a hunndred and change here or there when you make some rare items. Some parts cost 20k. As in you would have to spend 260$ in the shop to get the one part.This game could be so much more fun if they took some pressure off the pay-to-win model (lowered shop prices, made it a bit easier to make money in game) and fixed the broken matchmaking. Sadly i can't recommend this.			"

								Crossout is a game that brings robocraft and the world of mad max together. Like in Robocraft, you can create vehicles from scratch and mount weapons and various modules on them. There are tank tracks and wheels for mobility with possible plans for hover pods in the future. The creation system in this game is much more restricted than it is in robocraft. This helps to keep the game balanced and fun. The weapons you can choose from range from artillery cannons to a crossbow as well as rockets and machine guns. The modules include things like invisibility and turrets/drones that help you defend yourself or an area. This is a great game to play if you like being creative and blowing stuff up. Just remember, play the objective!			"

Short Version: Enjoyably simple car-fighting arena, plus rotating missions and loot to keep you coming back for more.  Super Special Bonus Feature: Lego Master Builder Mode - Create your own deathmobile with scrap metal and machine guns instead of colorful toy blocks!LAYER 1:  The ArenaCrossout is a game of many layers, but the core of Crossout is a relatively simple arena deathmatch with cars - you choose a vehicle, enter a match full of other players and Bots, and drive around ramming the enemies on the other team and blasting them with various mounted weapons until they blow up.  The graphics are nice, the controls and gameplay are rather basic (so it's easy for newbies to jump into the game), and the matches are quick and explosive enough to be entertaining.The arena mode is probably where casual players will spend most of their time. Driving around and blowing up friends and strangers for a few quick rounds is plenty of fun, and the battles are weighted by class so that you'll be matched with vehicles of roughly similar power.  There's also a nifty system of durability for every component of a car, so you can take an enemy apart piece by piece.  You could destroy an enemy's tires to ruin their mobility, then take out their unprotected deathcannon on the roof, leaving your opponent as a useless lump of metal taking feeble machine gun potshots at anyone driving by - at least until someone puts them out of their misery.However, arena battles in any game can grow stale, and Crossout's simplistic arena battles probably would not keep players around for long on their own.  Fortunately, the Crossout developers planned ahead for this and included...LAYER 2: Mission ModeIn addition to simple arena fights, Crossout includes a variety of 'raid' missions where you team up with a few fellow road-warriors to complete various objectives, such as protecting a transport vehicle or taking down certain enemy structures before the enemy can lay the smack down.  These rotating missions provide some welcome variety and challenge to the game, and are a fun option for casuals and regulars alike.  LAYER 3:  Builder Mode With just the arena and mission modes, Crossout is already a pretty entertaining game - and it is likely that these battle-modes are where casuals and semi-casuals will spend the vast majority of their time.  However, builder mode is what really sets Crossout apart.  Instead of simply choosing between a variety of preselected cars for your matches, Crossout allows you to build your own awesome amalgam of arms and armor.The builder mode is rather tricky, and I have not quite gotten the hang of designing cars from scratch yet.  Fortunately, for inept builders like me, players are able to use 'blueprints' to quickly copy a design.  These include basic cars created by the developers, as well as cars made by people gracious enough to share the results of their own experience and creativity.  These blueprints give more casual players (or those who simply want to blow stuff up instead of building it) a way to upgrade their car without worrying about the nitty-gritty building details.  Meanwhile, experienced players can fully utilize the building system to create personalized metal monstrosities kitted out in a myriad of ways, from heavily-armored rocket tanks to super-speedy, shotgun toting dune buggies.LAYER 4:  The LOOTAh yes, finally, the glue that holds almost every modern game together - the loot!  As you graduate from Crossout's basic arena mode to raid missions and more, you're eventually going to see someone driving something bigger and badder than you and want to upgrade your own ride to match.  Of course, in order to do - you'll need to get some new vehicle parts.This is where Crossout's looting system comes into play.  The looting system balances a generous amount of core drops with rare, high-tier gear that will take quite a while to work up to.  In addition to finding random pieces of gear with every match, the daily missions and 'seasonal' campaigns allow you to save up various in-game currencies to pick up some of those rare, higher grade weapons.  This provides a nice incentive to keep popping back in to play a few rounds every day or two.  The loot in Crossout is nice and plentiful, and you'll quickly gain access to better engines and more powerful weapons simply from playing the game.  Unfortunately, it should be noted that the freedom to design almost any car/truck/tank you can imagine comes with its own nasty limitation:  if you wanna build it, you gotta have the parts, and boy-howdy are there a heck of a lot of parts.  Chasing down every single piece for a nifty blueprint can be quite a challenge, and the sheer amount of options when designing your own car can be rather overwhelming.  The daunting loot system and the amount of grind necessary to get a large stock of higher end components will keep dedicated players from immediately farming everything and getting bored too soon - but this also makes the game feel like an enormous grindfest, and is why some players have complained about Crossout being 'pay to win'.  As an alternative to farming components yourself, Crossout's purchasable vehicle packs offer a quick way to get all the parts for a well-built automobile, along with a large chunk of currency to purchase additional upgrades.  Personally, I think that the Pay-to-Win complaints have a bit of merit, but are largely unfounded.  It is certainly true that buying a pack will give you a leg-up when starting off, but the cars themselves are not the highest-tier options; You could always farm gear to make something better.  The DLC vehicle packs are mainly a time-saver to give players a quick boost, or to provide spiffy new vehicles for those who don't want to delve too deeply into the 'Building' part of the game.Conclusion:Crossout combines simple, enjoyable arena gameplay (drive, shoot, car explodes) with a relatively deep building and looting system that allows you to personalize your car in looks, handling, and deadly loadout.  This enables the game to appeal to casuals, grinders, and master-builders alike, as there is literally something for everyone.  Crossout is definitely a game worth trying, even if it's simply to reminisce about Twisted Metal or pretend to be Mad Max for a few rounds.  Who knows, you might just like it enough to get sucked into the daily raid missions as you farm up enough loot to design your own Super-Death-Car.EARLY ACCESS WARNING:  Please be *fully aware* that this game will be F2P on release.  The paid Early Access version of this game is for a vehicle bundle as well as early beta access.  I highly recommend this game on the try-before-you-buy F2P model, but I can only recommend the $30 Early Access to those who are completely in love with the idea of building their own vehicle of doom.Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

Early Access Review
								It has been a while, a long while since I saw a game like this that has taken my attention so much I forgot to actually play matches lol.Alright.... enough of that lets start.The crafting system is very fun, I have not been playing long but the ratio of spending in the building screen is 70/30 (Building/Playing) so that system has my plus, especially when it is so fun trying to find out what works or doesn't and fine tuning what works to run efficiently without issue.The variety of options regarding how your play style is affected is a massive plus to me as I am able to switch play styles without worrying about how or what structuring I need on my vehicle, to me I am a sniper, but my playstyle is the opposite so I just went and built a vehicle that I can use in both roles.The gameplay itself is fast based and ruthless in how it begins and ends, it has the feel of a actual battle, it is very hard to not die when you only have minor amounts of armor but Crossout did the system very well with keeping its battle mechanics very realistic in how unfair it feels while the mechanics that keep it fair are in work, battle should never feel fair which is why I like Crossout, it gives a feel of Chaos/Order at the same time in its gameplay while staying fun to play.The missions while repetitive sometimes do keep you occupied well, the only issue is that the AI vehicles are always only at a maximum of 2000PS and do not go above that to balance their PS with yours, but they are fast and do get good armaments to compensate for that deficiency.There is also a system for showing your own vehicles (or tanks, I have seen some people make as accurate as possible tanks with the current equipment and building materials in game) and they did a very good job, and I have seen some weird vehicles too, lol.All in all I recommend this game as it is fun, keeps your attention and very creative.

								Crossout is a challenging and fun game full of blowing cars up like its Mad Max. Set in a post apocalyptic world, Crossout is a game were you control a car/tank hybrid and you craft it out of parts you earn in challanges, raids and pvp battles. This will be Free to Play later on so if you would rather wait until then and not spend 30$ its up to you, but you get instant closed beta access right now if you do pay and founders perks. I would recommend this game 10/10.			"

								I have played this game from very early on in the CBT (Closed Beta Testing) and I'm quite excited to see it's release on Steam! If you have played one of the ""Twisted Metal"" games on your Playstation consoles,you'll find elements of that game in this one. The core of the game is to go into battles,collect parts and pieces which you use to craft better parts in order to make your vehicle more effective in combat. The battles and building are fairly straight forward and are easy to get into. However,the crafting is a lot more in-depth and does require a bit of time to master. However,that won't present a barrier for a new player and after the basics are mastered through a tutorial,you'll be creating the wildest contraptions before you know it.The combat is fast and explosive - quite literally. Just after the first couple of seconds into the match,the action and adrenalin kick in and before too long you see vehicle bits and pieces fly around the battle ground. One thing that makes this game interesting is that you are able to take out a vehicle piece by piece. So if you play it clever and take out the guns of the enemy vehicle first,they will be defensless until the moment they go BOOM!Besides the standard PvP content,there is also Co-Op game modes,where players fight together waves of enemies or defend specific locations (like Oil rigs for example). There are multiple game modes and their numbers grow as the game is being developed. Given it just went into Early access here on Steam,I expect more interesting content in the future and I can't wait to see what's still to come.Overall the game is very fun to play and at first glance it looks like a mashup between the Mad Max theme and Robocraft. Once you have the basics down,you will just spend hours upon hours by just building your dream destruction machine,as I have found myself doing countless of times.I highly recommend this game to any player who likes to build his own creation and likes quick explosive action. It's also a game suited for players who have little time on their hands to play. The PvP matches only last up to 3 minutes ,so you can rack up a couple battles within a short period of time to give you that injection of fun you needed.			"

								Not played long but can definitely say im happy with my purchase. Here are my first impressions.The play style, leveling etc is very much the same as World Of Tanks, if you enjoy that game you will defo like this one. The difference being is that your vehicle Is crazy customizable, you can literally build your car from the ground up and armor/weapon up however you want and more importantly place parts where ever you want (within reason).The biggest complaint I have seen is the lack of matchmaking which isn't true. Just like WoT matchmaking is not based on level but based on the the base body/class of your vehicle, the better body you use allows you bigger/better guns etc which in turn puts you in higher ranked matches. However just like in WoT if you try and power lvl into getting the better body's as quick as possible you wont have the resources to be able to equip your car very well so you’re gonna constantly get your bum handed to you. So its very much worth your while sticking with a body and building up resources to get it well equipped.Anyway that's my first impressions see you at the end of my sights!			"

								Game is only midly interesting.  However the game auto linked my account to someone else Steam account, and customer service from Gaijin seems to not want to do anything about it.  Everytime I contact them about the issue they just copy and paste the instructions for how to link an account.  But I dont even think they read my ticket because Ive explained over and over again how my account is linked to the wrong steam Account.  So its hard to justify playing a game when all my progress isnt being saved to my account.			"

 Crossout DISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.Crossout is a third-person vehicle shooter where you craft your own machines and take on other players (and bots) in challenges. It reminds me of another game called ""Gas Guzzlers Extreme"" in which you race your vehicles while trying to destroy your opponents. Both of these games take place in a post-apocalyptic Mad Max-esque setting. The thing that sets this game apart from others is it's crafting and building system, where you craft new parts and weapons for your machine to do battle. -------- Graphics: 7 / 10  The graphics are really well done. The vehicles, maps and even the garage give off this grunge-y feel which of course contributes the post-apocalyptic setting of the game. The quality of the art assets and objects are great and is what you would expect from a modern game. Although not seen very often, the game has some cool character designs as well. The vehicles can be custom made to the player's liking and play-style, so whatever you want your machine to look like, given the parts you have, is up to you. The game surprisingly wasn't that demanding on my PC though anything lower than a mid-tier graphics card and CPU would not be recommended for this title.-------- Sound: 7 / 10  The sound assets of the game are pretty good. The gun shots and general car noises are decent and they do get the job done. The in-game music/soundtrack is surprisingly nice and fits in well with the motif of the game. -------- Mechanics: 7 / 10  The mechanics are competent and I haven't encountered any bugs or annoyances within them. You'll spend a lot of time in your garage putting together and testing your automobile. You can craft different parts for your vehicle using scrap you acquire while playing. You can also unlock new recipes for parts and this depends on which faction you are currently in. You can unlock new factions as you continue to play and gather recipes for each. You can customize your automobile and put parts wherever you want too (as long as they connect to your vehicle). You do different challenges and quick-matches for a chance to get get loot at the end of each round. The combat gameplay is solid, and although there are a few different game modes which I haven't explored yet, I've mainly played assault/capture the point. There are daily ""raids"" you can do, though I have not been able to do any because of the lack of players currently. There is a market place where you can sell and buy new parts. The game has a currency, and you can obtain this currency by selling parts on the market. You can also use real money to buy the in-game currency to buy parts. This is something that may turn off a lot of people from the game as it is possible to spend a bunch of real money in order to get the best parts for your car. However, all vehicles have a gear score, and if/when enough people are playing, I'd imagine the game would match players with similar gear scores together. This would mean that players with machines similar in strength would be matched against each other, rather than getting destroyed by vehicles with a higher gear score. -------- Final Personal Remarks: It's not a bad game, and I do see myself playing it from time to time. Much like how I did with ""War Thunder"" another title published by Gaijin. I'm not a big fan of the ""pay for currency"" method, but I don't think it'll affect me too much, especially with a gear scaling system put into place. The big problem with the game right now is that there's no one playing because it's in early access with a hefty price tag. It kind of wards people away. The game will eventually be free to play which will allow more people to try the game, though right now I can't even get try the game's ""raid"" system because I can never match up with enough people. The quick matches are usually populated with bots as again, it's hard to find other people to play with. I do see a lot of people enjoying this game and I do plan on playing it more to see where it goes. I'm not certain how difficult it will be acquire specific parts yet but right now it's not too bad. Thanks to the Devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.			"

								When I saw this game on the store, it reminded me of the ""Death Race"" trilogy. Driving around in a car with guns you've designed and build yourself.Here is a summary of my review, you can fully read it if you want to:Pros: - It's fun;- You can build your vehicle as you want;- Easy to use interface;- Doesn't get boring too fast;- You can rebuild your whole vehicle as many times as you want, without penalties;- The AI is programmed nicely (not too bad, not too good);Cons:- Every game you play is 1v1, 1v2 (or the other way around) or 2v2 with AI;- Not too many players play this game;- AI has some silly movements at the start of a game;Full review:When I started up the game, it was originally in Russian, but that's probably due to the developers, and then the tutorial started. Every level (so far) you reach gives you items and a little story, and with those items you can design and build your vehicle as you desire.As for the building itself, it's quite easy. The game has a slick interface so building your own vehicle isn't too hard. I'm not one for designing my own vehicles, but I found that if you take one of the designs the game gives you and remove everything (I placed it onto the ground so I could grab it again) and keep the frame, making your own vehicle is rather fun.The game offers a vast number of items and weapons you use to build your vehicle, and because it is set in a post-apocalyptic world, most items are scrapped from other vehicles, such as an airplane cockpit for your cabin, or van walls, doors and windows. Building your vehicle in such a manner that your cabin is protected but at the same time you have enough space to mount a few guns and blow your opponents away, is critical and again, fun to do. The game also gives you certain sprays you can use on most of the items, to give your vehicle the colour you want.The game's population, however, is very low. The game offers two types of battles you can do: for items, or raids. Raids consist of (usually) 3 to 4 players against a group of AI. Battles for items consist of players vs players, and the empty slots are filled with AI. So far I have joined fights where it was 2 players vs 2 players, and the rest was AI. Then again, every battle I participate in, has 1 or 2 players in it.The battles themselves are quite fun and can be quite challenging sometimes. Two types of battles (for items) are available: one where your target is capturing the enemy base, or to capture the neutral base. You can win by either fully capturing the base or destroying every enemy. If all players are killed, who-ever captured most of the base wins, or who-ever has more vehicles available in case no-one captured a base.The last game I played was another player and myself versus two other players. I managed to destroy the guns of both the enemy players and was shooting at one of them to destroy their cabin and thus their vehicle, but the game ended. Even though my teammate and I were still driving around shooting them, and they were driving around without guns being unable to do anything, it was a draw. Trust me, if we had 10 more seconds, they would both be destroyed.As for the AI, it's not the best, but at the same time it's pretty well made. When a game starts, one or two AI tend to crash. Whether it's into your vehicle, into another AI vehicle or into the wall, every start gaurantees a crash or two. However, half a minute into the game, the AI does a very good job. They're not too accurate, but not too stupid either. Unlike players, they just aim for your vehicle or cabin.			"

It's moving, it's moving!I was waiting for the key for over 8 months - that's sad, taking into consideration that the majority of the CBT players aren't actually testing the game: they play, they get bored, they uninstall.But that's not about me! I've played Crossout for some time and can finally write a review!What is Crossout?Crossout is a MMO free-to-play action-sandbox, where you take part in dynamic and fast-paced battles using the post-apocalyptic battlecars. Or race cars. Or tanks.Though building system isn't very comfortable at the moment, it's really interesting but also simple to understand!Game rounds take no more than 3 minutes, but are full of action and explosions.Why is Crossout the best sandbox I've played?Economy and crafting! Finally we have an in-game marketplace where people can buy and sell the vehicle parts they've crafted or simply don't need. That's easy: find a module with the best sell price, take part in some battles, craft this module and sell it to gain some profit! That makes Crossout not only a simple shooter, but also a more thought-out economy game!Do I want anything else?That would be great if in Crossout you could build much larger battlecars. Yes, we have Leviathans in the game, but I want a '8 Levis vs. 8 Levis' game mode!SummaryCrossout is a great game with a great potential. I'm sure it will be very popular when OBT starts. Unfortunately, all the progression will be wiped then, but I would be happy to progress again!9 wheels/10 "

								Very addictive and fun game !... you lose time when you are playing, its just flies by, so give it a go you will NOT regret it !All you you need is some basic game play knowledge to play, so if you have played FPS Shooters, Driving Games and even played with LEGOs, you will have all that it takes to play the game and do very well !No Pay to win here, you only pay to progress a bit faster, so do not listen to the dedicated haters... just listen to the fair criticism from players, and really there is not much whatsoever to complain about, Devs have done a great job so far, if you do happen to get frustrated when you die, just rethink your vehicle design, add some light armour like the Van Parts, that really helps a great deal and still keeps your vehicle very fast, chain wheels are also the best to use  If you outfit vehicle well enough, you can dominate matches very quickly ! I just use a 20mm Auto Cannon and a Shotgun on the 4 x 4 parts, and designed a 6 wheeled vehicle for much better stability, and in about 4 hours or so I have 60 kills, and about 3-4 kills a match... some players use tank parts, its important to stick in groups, work as a team and try and take out the track(s), or even just shoot their weapons off, they are pretty hopeless after thatConstruction side of the game is great fun too, you can spend hours just creating werid and interesting designs, you can also see what other players have made, and you and test drive their machines and even download their blueprintsAs I said, if you have played FPS, Racing and played LEGOs in the past, then you will have great fun with this game ! you will NOT be disappointed !

								I'm writing this review to explain how it isn't pay-to-win in any way, shape, or form. For a quick ""Do I recommend this game?"" Yes I do. Hands down. Even in its early access-closed beta state, it is extremely addictive and fun. It needs polishing but thats why it is in closed beta, for feedback and improvement. 8/10 (for a free game when it launches, I think it deserves 8-9/10). NOW onto p2w. In the game you can purchase ""packs"". These packs simply give you a better boost to starting the game by giving you a stronger starter vehicle, the performance of these cars is nowhere near any higher tier cars ive faced. Other than that slight boost, you cannot buy ANYTHING else. You cannot buy parts with money, cars, or !Coins!. Coins get you anything you want (depending on the cost), if you could buy coins, it would be pay 2 win. But since you can't it isn't even close to pay2win. Besides, having a strong car won't even guarentee you a win. You cannot carry in this, no matter how hard you try. Sure, some games you will wipe the whole team, but that is every so often. Otherwise this game does require skill and there are counters in the game for each style of battle. Melee, long range, and sustain as I would lable them. Also due to the limitations in crafting (energy, part limit, and weight: all which can be increased with level and parts to a certain extent) no one can be overly OP. (unless you are using a Leviathan which is No Holds Barred in custimization).Side Note: The custimization is great. It is truly what I wished the Twisted Metal franchise should have been. EDIT: I would also like to add that, yes, during American day-time hours, the game can have low player count and long que times. That is because it isn't very popular here yet, it is a Russian made game so it is more popular in Europe. If you switch servers Europe, that will help you slightly, but playing later at night will help more since that is when Europeans are online mainly. Otherwise, wait until more people get the game, it only just came out on Steam and IS in closed beta, so low player count is to be EXPECTED. When the game is Free, you can surely expect a HUGE rise in the player base.EDIT2: With the help of the power level system. Even if you bought as much as possible from the packs, you would simply be put with other people who bought the same stuff. So it isnt pay 2 win if you are just against people just as strong as you, making it an even match.			"

								This is rather an interesting game.The idea of it, set in a post nuclear world, is awesome. Build vehicles, fight against other vehicles, get parts from then then continue to upgrade yours. The building in it, once learnt, is rather enjoyable and rather weird designs come out. The actual HUD and interface and all of that area is good, quite fitting for the scene etc. And the opening cinematic is just damn awesome.It is a great idea of a game and really really do hope to see it improve.I know I have only put just under an hour in-game but most of the game is combat and I just don't enjoy the combat, it is mildly upsetting.However there is 2 major set backs for me.1) I have only actualyl scene only a handful of maps whilst playing, they get pretty repetative and pretty boring very quickly.2) The fast paced combat in the game (Which has been done very well) just is sluggish and sloppy. It feels like you don't really need to do anything, even though there are goals in it, there just never is the push for you to get them. You just drive about shooting things. Apart from these 2 minors, the game is rather good.. I just hope they improve the battles as they are sloppy and no real aiming at ''weak-points'' etc.. you just click and shoot.(giving it a positive review because I love the idea of the game and the way it was made and the fact it is basically unique -- and lots of room for improvement)			"

								I will keep this review updated, just to keep people informed if its worth buying the game or not early on.Day 1: I am trying to play the game without the perks you get ingame for early access, so far it seems alright early game, currently level 6. I have only come across a handful of active players in PvP, which is making PvP missions rather easy right now.  As much as I like only versing bots, I noticed a pattern with bots, if you disable their weapons, they are going to try to ram you to death instead of going for the cap point (where applicable, some probably couldnt drive because lack of wheels). Every now and then, a player will hop in and play against me, but so far the meta, personally, is to try to take out guns and wheels on actual players, let the bots kill each other in their weird bloodbath, and if all else fails, earn that cap if possible...I cant tell you how many draws I got just because everyone was trying to kill each other and no one was going for a cap when time ran out. I made the mistake of letting a live player go after disabling his weapons, and they went to cap and ended up losing due to the cap points being 0-1. Now my experience with the premium car you get: I didnt drive it, but it looks nice, but from what I see, it will be great on land, but suck on any wet patch as it not only slows you down slowly, but you cant steer...at all, aka hydroplaning. I see 2 shotguns, so its a close up fighter, but doesnt have much armor, so its really great for driveby shooting if you know how to aim while driving by/circling around. You dont want to be standing still with this car unless you want your opponent to shoot off your shotguns/wheels until you die. Is the car itself worth $30? Nah, the game is nice so far and you do get to keep it and the ingame currency you get into the open beta and final release, so it will be a nice car to boost your level when things get reset. Its around 2000 powerscore, so by no means is it OP, I would reccomend for beginners to use the car for a quick level boost, but for mid to late game, I would think building a newer mashine is much better. The market? I wouldnt bother buying anything from the market right now with ingame currency if you do decide to buy early access, the prices are insane at the moment.Day 2:I tried out the premium vehicle that you get from buying early access to the closed beta of this game, all I can say is if you like controllable powersliding, this is the vehicle for you, and its blue rated mostly-everything-on-it, especially the dual shotguns, well placed shots can quickly disarm/disable your opponents. You will have to be at a angle, since both shotguns cant aim directly behind or in front of you. Protip: Sneak for cap point, get 1 point if all you are playing against in PvP are bots, go for 2 if there are live players, you can rush back to get the 3rd if they try capping your point. Aim for the guns, means of mobility, leave for dead until you rinse and repeat for all enemies, then go kill everyone, ez mode. "

								If you like Robocraft (or how it used to be) you'll like this game.Pros:+ Fast paced 3 minute matches+ There are PvE raids if you get tired of PvP+ Any item can be obtained without having to pay money+ You can test out stock vehicles/weapons before you buy them+ Good sound and graphics+++ The satisfaction of blowing apart your enemies piece by piece until they explodeCons:- It's closed beta so there aren't a lot of players yet (you could help change that)- It can be a bit of a grind to buy/craft high level parts (better than having to pay for them, tho)Bottom line is: even if you don't want to pay $30 to get into closed beta, it's a good idea to follow this game because when it goes open beta it'll be free.

								Have been playing the game even before it came out on Steam early access and I found it immense fun! I have grown up on the ""Twisted Metal"" games,so this game brings back some nice memories with a refreshing new look. The game is a lot of fun since it's fast-paced and explosive. It features both PvP and Co-Op elements and you'll find yourself playing both those modes,not only because they are fun,but also because PvP and Co-Op battles give out different rewards and/or resources which you need to craft better parts.One of my favorite parts of the game (apart from the combat) is the assembly of your vehicle. It gives you complete freedom over how you're vehicle is going to look like and perform in battle. The only limitation here is your imagination and available parts you have.Overall,I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes building,crafting and vehicle combat. It's a great game that will captivate you right from the get-go. :)			"

								Mad Max, Twisted metal black on steroids, csgo type economy and matchmaking. Most games run for like a few minutes. High octane awesomeness coming to free to play in the next few months but, well worth the money where you get starting kit well worth the money.You get car parts, can buy them along with various weapons, with csgo type rarity etc, and build your lethiathan of a vehicle to do battle. If you do well you get drops just like csgo, but a lot more frequent, like you almost always get scrap metal, which you can sell together to buy parts when you have enough.  You need to log in through the gaijan portal, which you can just do with your steam login, and your items are not visible in the steam economy, just ingame which are the only cons on this gem. Once you start playing its difficult to stop, the car building can be a little counter intuitive but when you get the hang of it, its a really great experience to craft your new car, modify your current and get out here and do battling. I really love this, because start the game, and you can be battling in a minute or less, matchmaking is superfast in the general modes, but for the more specialists modes you can be waiting a few minutes. And most games are over in a couple of minutes so, its not so involving as csgo, theres no communication apart from an ingame chat which i dont see anyone using. But perhaps there is voice chat and i aint activated it, in anycase, early access, you know it will come. There are clans you can join, create to work together and battle against, i haven't done much with this yet, but will update the review when i do. Don't think about it, just buy it, its a real gem of a game.oh also, 133 achievements for those hunters out there !!!edit: been logged on for the past couple of hours, just trading the market for spare parts. The market is fresh enough to make money out of the 'spreads' for some parts!! and apparently, for a trader like me ... irresisble to take advantage of :) ... probably end in tearsedit: so I'm 144+ hours in, and just realised the multiplayer is well grounded with bots which provide fluid multiplayer game play. If you are a high level and there arn't many other players on your level, the spare slots in multiplayer are filled with bots. I only just realised which demonstrates how well the AI works.			"

								EDIT 2: THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY A DOWN VOTE. I have revised my vote after speaking with the developers, however the text below is unchanged.Alright so, I have been looking for a game like this for EVER. I'm going to be perfectly honest here.I found this game and was ecstatic. Couldn't wait, PAID for closed beta. After about 50 hours of AMAZING gameplay/building. I made it to level 17. Unlocked leviathan. Was ecstatic again. Loaded a game, ANNDDD it was virtually unplayable. I wen't from being able to go in to a game and destroy almost every bot like it was scrap, and to do this I didn't even need to come near the part/power limits. To not being able to put enough parts/power on it to equally match those I'm pitted against. Cannons 5-10x the size of mine, mini-guns against my little vector. THAT is the difference between level 16, and 17. I made it through to 16 personally too fast, and now 35 hours later. I'M STILL AT LEVEL 17. I barely level up each game even IF I manage to get a couple kills, and even then my weapons are so pathetic I feel like I'm just taking those kills from my bots. This game went from WAY TOO EASY. to WAY TOO HARD. Not in a challenging I wanna keep trying and eventually win way either. More of a , what the **** where did this come from? A little progression towards this would be great. I went from blowing through the levels 3-4 games and I'd rank again. Now, as I said, 35+ hours at level 17. Goodbye, new friend.BALANCE THE GAME.EDIT: Also let me say this again just to clearify. I LOVE THIS GAME. Last week I'd have recommended it to anyone.  However $30 to spend that much time waiting for matches, and run in to such an imbalance not even half way through the game. At this point it's not even fun to play and try to earn those items becase I don't want to make the next person feel the way I do. (ESSENTIALLY: I'm not going to just sit and grind so once I have those weapons I can do the same thing to someone else.) Make the game fair. No one wants a battle too hard, OR too easy.When you ask for money to keep working on a game. I surely hope your goal is to make the game what the payers want. If you want to make a game all on your own all your ideas, USE YOUR OWN MONEY. Or ask for it, after it's done, not before.I am depressingly dissapointed.			"

								good buiding mecanism, but the bots make this game literally unplayable. I want to compete against real players, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that has 3k PS and 1 of the starting machine guns. The bots are so useless, and when theres 3 players in 1 battle,  theres 2  in 1 team and 1 in other, and its so unfair. We need more active players. The shop is really good idea, and the factions, its original and handy, when you need to: Make ammo box etc.i recommend, and wait for the future updates :) 8,5 / 10 Will there be a trade system, like thing where 2 players can change stuff?it would be really good, a little added thing would make getting stuff easier, like if 1 guy wants a pyre and other an AC 72, why they couldnt change their stuff?but its only my opinion, and i know, that theres people that would like to get this kind of system in crossout.i have spoken for now.have a great day.

								This game. This metal blasting game. I got hooked almost immediately. Not only it is post apocalyptic, it also has guns and cars. I can make my own car basically, from the parts I get, mount shiton of guns on it and go. I love how it all falls apart, you shoot the part, it falls off. No ""you shoot on it for long enough, it blows up"". You can even immobilize another car by destroying it's wheels. You do have similar stuff in other games. Postapo cars with guns- Mad Max. Building machines and partially destroying them- Robocraft. Just an example. But developer picked all that is great in these games and created something new... and amazing.			"

								This game doesn't seem like pay to win until you reach about level 10 or 4000 rating. Then it becomes painfully obvious that you either grind for parts for hundreds of hours (not kidding, that literally is the figure) so you can compete, or spend another $40-$60 so you can compete with everyone else who has dropped at least that much money.Grinding out so I can have competitive weapons (again, a proces that would take at least 100+ hours), isn't worth my time, and neither is this game good enough to pay another $100 or so dollars to get the gear I need to be really conpetitive. If it weren't so linked to the slow economy, this game would be fun, but the grind gets boring quickly. If you're not willing to grind, grind, grind, then consider this game full on Pay to Win. Do Not Buy. Also, this will most likely be Free to Play once Beta is over, at least wait and see fi that happens if you can.			"

								Crossout is a fun game, it is a game with a Mad Max feel to it. After 10-20 hrs you understand how much grind there is in this game. You can some what pay and skip some of the grindines. There are some modes to play in this game, PvP and PvE. PvP to get your fuel to use for the PvE Raids to get the copper you badly need to craft, wheels, guns ect. I hope they cut down some of the grinding in the game and add more battlegrounds. After what I have seen there are only 4-5 different battlegrounds. I can recommend the game, but maybe not at full prize. It is prized way over what early access games normally are.			"

I got bored of the game beceause i kept seeing those and it was no fun. but this game will be better in the future. ᶦ ʰᵒᵖᵉ			"

								Ok first thing is first its a shooter yes, is it counter strike, no. That out of the way if you ever played robocraft, its like mad max meats robo craft. That is what drew me to this I saw the P2W comments then realised this is gonna be f2p so these just the usual needs an excuse crowd. This game just like other new games Gaijen is helping out like Starconflict has both PVP and PVE going on you do not have to be a master at PVP, like some people think. So to some up, like Robocraft meets mad max, gonna be f2p before year is out, but has PVP and PVE optionsAlright lets start with like Robocraft, meets mad max. If you can't tell form videos and what not you can make your own rides thes all kind of look like standard real life cars but in reality its like robocraft they were just built that way, because it works. You get specaly under carrage parts you can make them long and wide if you fee like it. But most don't got wide as you attack head on normally or camp head on its not bad idea to go skinny and long to fit all your parts.Like Robocraft its based score system but unlike it where you limited on what parts to use, any part you can get your hands on and you do earn armor parts via grind, but can buy, earn or craft ingame all the non armor parts its just a bit of work for the high end stuff. Now the way this works isn't MMO style its a shooter for one, like robo craft its score based every bock you can use has its own score, and stats so you can't make a an armed beast with legendary guns and be in the low level matches you basicly have to be a a pair of tracks, a cabin and a gun to do that lol. Anyways that is how it works.Now some people new to this think every one who is higher then them must be magicly using hte best ever parts in spades. But you can't do this, you can't rock high end parts with out compromising and using paper armor on most your rig. Now what you do is armor one key spot normally the front people don't get that and shoot that one armored part and think its all a tank but a shotgun or cannon shell to the side and you rip off half their stuff there, thanks to the score system, or just shoot off the gun(s) if you got an accurate weapon like maching gun or aiming with a cannon.Now I got that covered here is the next part people don't get, this is going f2p all these max levels you may see, I hardly see, a rank 40. These guys are gonna be reset to one just like you when CBT ends, then on top of that tons of new players with out good gear are gonna pile in right 98% of players paid some kind of cash and bought some pack full of nice parts to start with on day one, but there is a whole world of cheap gamers who will show up when this is new with none of that, and of course complain your too op with your 2 shotguns in the steam pack lol.I warn people of this becuase that freaks them out, yes your are gonna get wiped, but your playing now to learn how to play so one day one, you can b-line for your fave playstyles parts, you can use this time to dink around get killed, kill a few yourself, and look at all these vets builds when you die. Don't run to the garage and rage that you can't reque till your rig is out. You are gonna get wiped anyways, so look at the others when your dead. Make a note of how they did their rigs, how they play the game, and learn so you can try it out. Who cares if you go bust doing it, on day one you are reset as well as the rest of us. I learned heaps from that and now lets play videos of other people with no clue like me, testing and failing or suceeding.Last bit this has a bit of PVE and PVP the way it works is simple you can't just PVE all day long unless you want work for it. PVE requires gas in your tank, every day I think you get more, but if you pvp with a feul barrel, it cost no energy used for impartant parts like guns and weapong radiators, but catch is you want to hide it and protect it, because its a gas tank it explodes when broken and can tear up parts near it when it goes. But you put that in your build and now every win you bring back some gas, and to make it more awsome it doesn't go in the tank with 200 limit you pile it in your storage with the parts for making your rig. So you can pile up tons of it, and sell it if need be to other players for stupid cheap, not really worth it, or just right click pour in the tank to top it off so I can PVE all day.And what is the big diff minus the gas PVE gets you coupons, collect 300 and you can make a loot crate. Think of it like those chests you need p2w keys in other games to open but you don't in this. You open it up and its a chance you gonna get a part from any faction in game of blue or purple qulity or small chance you get a cometice. Now the cosmetic you think oh that is lame these give you rep bonus if you use them on your rig, basicly exp bonus and you can sell them to other players on the market who want that bonus, or just want to make a pretty car with it. You get a cap for these coupons every day based on diffculty, You also copper sheets used to make blue quality gear, and some wires for high end stuff. So even PVPers need to do a little basic PVE if they wnat stay ahead.And that long winded reveiw is basicly what you need to know I didn't share any fun stories or cool stuff like that just basic stuff you should want to know before buying the steam pack. Things people come in and have no idea about. So to sum up again its like robocraft meets madmax, its score based not level. Its gonna be f2p, you could wait till then but then you could also rage about not knowing anything about how the game works first hand, and about people like me using are 2 little shotguns to tear up your stuff, even though I have expeinced guys with common grade lmgs tear them off all the time in pvp leaving me only with the abilty to try and ram before my wheels are shot off next lol And lastly it has pretty decent pvp, and pve system you need a bit of both but could just go all in either one, if you want work a little more, and buy and sell things to get the copper from not raiding, or buy gas because you don't like pvp.

								This game is AMAZING......... Mad Max meets Twisted Metal meets World of Tanks...... I have to say I was very skeptical of buy'n this game yes in steam db it does only show an average of 50 players but you have to think zbout all the ppl who are not using steam and playing. Now that I have it I have nothing but good things to say about it. You can do PvP , PvE and brawls. You can build your own vehicle or use a blueprint or tweek a blueprint to your satisfaction.The list goes on and on if you ever have a question about it or the current status I would love to inform you. I would love to see more ppl bite on this title and make it grow in its current beta state. Yes you have to pay for Beta and the game will go free to play on release. So to finalize this pick it up and you will be very pleased or wait for it to be F2P but give it a try or your really missing out on a great title.			"

								Lets get straight to the point. I was debating to myself wether to get Crossout at it's original £24.99 price, but then I managed to get it at £9.99 which after playing it, is a bargain (get David Dickinson in here quick).One of the main things I liked the look of in this game is the customization, and when I started playing it, it did'nt dissapoint. The amount of variety in this game with parts and literally everything is customisable, placement wise to paint jobs. The gameplay is fun and quite easy to get used to, time varies with different weapons because of placement on your car and distance.There are quite a few maps for a beta too, and to be honest the games don't last that long so you don't really have time to glide through the whole map.Overall this game reminds me of games like smugglers run & twisted metal. The destruction is awesome too!! Have you ever saw a tank been blown up piece by piece to just literally the frame and engine? Well if you buy this game you will.Oh it also has a market place that functions too!! So you can buy new weapons and frames etc. THIS GAME IS AWESOME FROM WHAT I'VE PLAYED SO FAR!!			"

								Well I enjoy this game i bought it and bought all the packs. Problem is there is too many ai's in the game rooms and not all players are able to join rooms. Most players including me have waited along time to get in rooms and then when we do get in its maybe 2 or 3 players on each team and rest are ai's. and the ai's are programmed over players ability to win. Over all the game is still a plus and can use adjustments.			"

								An incredible mash up of engineering, mechanical & shooter elements. If Rocket League and World of Tanks had a baby.... There is a huge amount of freedom right from the start in regards to building and customization. Player driven market that actually makes sense and fun match system for both pvp and pve. I will recommend this game for many years so long as the devs keep up the momentum.			"

								Mad Max style vehicles, with Twisted Metal styled gameplay, and Robocraft styled customization, each part of your vehicle is destructable and will effect the performance just as the game says. I've not gotten to into the game yet, and I probablly will never update this review again, but I Highly recommend this to any Twisted Metal fan or anyone who likes similar games, and customization, (I've never played a Mad Max game or seen any movies yet, so I cant really recommend this game to fans of MM though I'm almost sure they'd like it)			"

								So I'm currently around 8 hours in and really liking it so far.Gameplay:Currently I've played both the PvP matches and the PvE ""Raids"" and have been enjoying them both. The PvP matches only last around 3 minutes which makes them short and sweet, They don't drag on but you do get plenty of action in those few minutes. A really good format for the game. So far the matchmaking has been pretty solid too.The PvE ""Raids"" matches can last a little longer than the PvP matches (Depends on the type of ""Raid"", Some last longer than others.) but still don't drag on. There is a good variety of these Raids with more (Harder) ones unlocked as you level up.The vehicles control fairly well and it has a good amount of customisation regarding binding different weapons to different keys/Mouse button.The Building:Possibly one of the best things about this game, The actual building ""Editor"" has been done really well, Really solid and I haven't really had any issues with it so far, Only thing I'd say is the camera controls can be a little confusing to begin with but I got used to it fairly quickly.You get a decent amount and variety of parts to begin with and once you gain a few levels you'll have more than enough parts to play around with.Being able to instantly test drive your vehicle is really useful as well, Really nice addition.One of the most fun things in this game is just building the vehicles and seeing what works and what doesn't. You'll also never really meet the same player created vehicle twice as there are so many options.Performance/Graphics:Performance wise it runs really well, I can run it maxed out on a Intel G3258 and GTX 950 at a solid 60FPS, Really well optimised game.Graphics wise it looks really good considering how well it runs, Haven't noticed any major graphical issues at all.Regarding this bundle, the vehicle ""Blueprint"" you get is pretty good, Does well and is a good starting point for you own creations, 2000 in-game coins is also a good amount for the price considering you get access to the closed Beta as well.Overall a very fun game with a lot of potential, Would definitely recommend.PS: A Linux version would be nice Devs. ;)			"

								One of the best games I've played in awhile. It's a prefect mix of Twisted Metal, RoboCraft and Madmax. The game feels AAA quality. The sounds are some of the best, .50 cal browning actually sounds like a .50 cal browning. Vehicle customization is top notch and the fact you can build from the ground up with thousand or so parts to choose from. Want to build a VW bus on tank treads with 6 machine guns? This game is going F2P evntually so it may be worth waiting till then instead of paying to get into the closed beta. 9/10			"

								This game is alot of fun but to play it now you have to buy a premium pack from their website. add to that the ""pre order"" pack thats advertised right here on the page it's fair to say that all the closed testers will have two premium cars to play with alongside the starter. The game is pretty much a madmax themed robocraft. the cars and parts are all modular and snap together like legos and blocks so you can make them any shape you want. i spent several hours just tinkering with the build mode than actually playing. the times of actualy playing the game the controls were pretty much identical to old robocraft. and the vehicle falls to pieces as you're shot up but still not down until the cab is destroyed. It's fun. Lots of fun. If things dont go wrong in the future like certain other games, it will be totally worth it			"

								So, it is definitely P2W, but it doesn't really matter. Let me explain why: All those shiny high end guns they have? You can shoot them off. Those power increasing generators they have? You can shoot them until they explode. The destructability of the cars, in my opinion really negate the P2W aspects. Sure you probably won't fair well in the starter car against a cannon, but its not like you don't have any kind of chance. Shoot off wheels and they will just sit there. Blow off the guns and they can't hurt you from a range. Melee weapons (Spikes, explosive lances and the like) seem a bit OP right now, but at the same time, they have to get really close to use them.So all in all I reccommend this game. I'll give you a list here so you can just look at that.Pros1. Total Customization - Build a vehicle completely unique to you.2. 100% Destructability - You can shoot off individual parts. 3. Going F2P - Here soon it will be F2P, you'll have nothing to lose but your time by giving it a shot.4. Graphics - Game looks really good, thats just my opinion, it is subjective mind you.5. Optimized - I'm running pretty powerful hardware, but the game seems really smooth, even with everything going on.6. Market - In-game market makes it easy to buy and sell parts you want.Cons1. Grindy - It can take some time to get really badass parts. Like a lot of time.2. Timers - When you make things, there are wait times. Some of them get pretty long.3. Match Finding - Parties can only go against other parties and it WILL increase your wait time just because of this. Indifferent1. P2W Factor - It is P2W, sure, but the ability to get premium currency is pretty easy and even though the fancy parts are helpful, they can get destroyed in matches (Not forever mind you, you'll always have those parts unless you sell them) and those factors combined negate it in my opinion.2. Bots - More than likely, you'll end up in matches that are comprised entirely of Bots. This I think helps reduce wait time finding matches, but Bots are easy to scrap, mostly. All in all, I do reccommend this game. Remember kids, reviews are opinions, I find that I like this game, you might hate it for the exact reasons I like it and thats ok.EDIT: Forgot to mention Power Score herlping to Negate P2W aspects as well. Its basically your vehicle rating. Match making trys to put you with similarly scored players. So if anything you're just shooting yourself in the foot by buying a bunch of stuff before getting solid on the basics first.			"

								Build your own vehicle and compete against others. Join a clan or perhaps become a merchant buying and selling parts in the advanced economic market system.  There is a nice variety of parts, weapons and cosmetics to keep the game interesting when building new vehicles. Both PVP and PVE is available and a nice diversity of missions become available at different times keeping the PVE missions fun. Craft better weapons with the parts you win on the battle field and work toward unlocking legendary and relic weapons.The best things about this game is that the developer makes good decisions when putting out new patches that improve the game and overall experience. For a game still in closed beta it is surprisingly bug free and a pleasure to play. This is the best PVP building game I've played and I've played many of them. 10/10.			"

								I got the early access key from developers so I could check it out and make some videos of the game, so here's my FIRST LOOK into the game: 


YouTube™ Video: Crossout - Destruction Derby with Weapons - FIRST LOOK 

			Views: 2,166		

			First Look into the epic car combat MMO called Crossout. This is one of the best car combat games I've ever seen, really love the concept.		

I absolutely love the game and I don't just say it because they gave me the key.Game concept is very goodBuilding system is epic, you can freely build pretty much whatever you want, tanks, cars, trucks ..etc. It's also very easy to build things, it doesn't take you more than 5 mins to figure out the building system.So basically what you do, is build your vehicle and then battle with it. It's MMO, so there's no offline mode, there are bots, but it's still online.There's also market, where players can sell their stuff for game credits (or buy them). You can specify your own price for items.What's also good, is that game runs smooth and it has nice graphics. I can run it in 4k maxed out with GTX 1080 and it's stable 60fps, so i'm sure with lower end cards you can easily play it maxed out in 1080p.I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs either.I hope they'll add demolition derby mode (no weapons allowed),  that would make the game even better.Also there's lack of different game modes / types, but game is in early access, i'm sure they'll change that .. at least i hope they do :)I highly recommend this game, I haven't seen anything that good for a long time.

								With No Man's Sky being a complete fail. Very hard to decide what games you should be buying these days. Some key features that stick out in Crossout are that they monitor chat fairly strict. You will fight along side and vs devs a lot, and they are always in chat talking and telling more about updates and fixes. RoboCraft is on the side lines while Crossout is the MVP of the game. Gaijin still updates many of the games they have released. They did ruin World of Tanks with some bad updates and very high pay to win items. Yet they still have held a high player base across many games. They do like micro transactions a lot. This game can be a bit of a grind to start but what game isn't? Also if you don't spend a dime on the game, you will still be able to kill the players who did. The game is based on a PowerScore which each building item or gun has, applying more items to the build you have will raise the power score. Then the PowerScore of what you have built will separate you into brackets for the match. People will have a epic item in low brackets, but it's not to say you won't even have a chance. Knowing the maps, working with teammates(Can't stress that enough) also having just a all around steady build that works for you will and can do so much on putting up a good fight during a match. I highly recommend Crossout, even with the price tag set for now. For me its the mass assortment of items and ways you can really build that keeps me going. It's hard to explain really.. but just the factor of having a better build not even to say better guns, you can use all grey guns and still win when in a match with people using epic guns. All depends on how well you build, and with a mass amount of items to build with you can tweak a playstyle down to a tee.			"

The amount of crazy crap people come up with is also half the battle.			"

								The game simply has a very short trial period, even though it is free to play, before the AI bots in PVP are just creaming you with legendary weapons and heavy chassies. It takes a very long time to work up to getting good gear and what I hate the most is even if you win a match, if you don't score enough points then you are payed NOTHING expect the few xp you earns. If they want to run the game to keep profits up I suggest moving to a cheap subscription fee. It could just be a dollar a month but then you wouldn't be crippling new commers that want to try it early on.			"

								If you like games like Robocraft you will probably like this (I haven't played Robocraft since 2015 so I base this on how the game was back then). It is a lot of grinding but that is the way it kind of has to be in order to urge you to continue playing. It can be slow and frustrating at times though, especially if you often end up on the losing team.+ Controls well+ Good sound effects+ Acceptable graphics (nothing special but does the job)+ Loading times pretty much non existant (waiting time is another story at times)+ Pretty good variety of parts- AI pathfinding is pretty bad (horrible at times)- Most achievements are a joke!- Slow progression (at least in my experience)- Sometimes long wait times- Some annoying F2P tendencies with credits			"

								So far, this game is awesome. The PS matchmaking works well (most of the time) and it balances the matches pretty fairly. The game gives off an awesome Mad Max feel to it, and it's amazing. This game basically took Robocraft, removed the pay to win, and then added the Mad Max atmosphere. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10 as it is right now.			"

								-Review if you are paying for CrossOut- With a heavy heart im changing my opinion on this game from positive. It really is unfortunate too because the gameplay ROCKS it had EVERY ASPECT i love about building and destruction. Though the endless grinding makes me sick, I paid $30 for this game and it forces me to grind for more than i bargained for. Im not playing more when i feel im not progressing. I like many of you have a life and a full time job, im not investing 300hrs into a game to get an end game weapon. im sure there are many crossout players that can work the market and get exactly what they want, i dont have time for that. Im really hoping to come back to this game after they change the system. Peace out.			"

								800 hour+ review.first let me say I love the ""IDEA"" of this game but it is majorly flawed.It is beyond resonable in the grinding to get parts to build with department.As is until the wipe it is also basicly unplayable for new players to a great extent as even after hundreds of hours you have zero chance to build a competitive rig that can run with the people that not only mount dual lagacy gold items that takes you literaly months to get,but have they have had so many of them as to be able to upgrade them .The rewards for winning pvp battles is insanely low and offer almost no incentive to try and win a battle instead of just head hunt exp.The prices on the market is insanley too high and unless you are a addict player you will simply never be able to even compete as you will like most people quit long before out of frustration.There are al;so huge balance issues in the ps system, for example ,..you will have zero chance against a person mounting two scorpions w/scope who can one shot kill you from the other side of the map or the guy mounting 3 explosive barrel tossers, until you have played for many hundreds of hours.They say the match making will be better after launch but unles they change some basic rules of mounting there is no chance it will help.For example if they only allowed a player to mount 1 leg item per vehical it would go a long long way to fixing thus miss match issue, or set the weapon power usage so high they can only mount 1 per rig.Frankly they should get rid of the market place all together and simply put all the weapons into the faction rewards as you level.there is also issues like items needed to craft with that you can only get during clan missions and such , after 800 hours i still can't get into those :/ simply because im not in a clan , but if you want one of those afore mebntioned OP weapons like the scorpion the needed craftingf parts are out of reach to you.This game would be so much mort fun if they did away with all the crap they have in it that makes it just a boring frustrating grind to get parts.For example i think most players would be fine with being able to have access to all weapons and parts right away day one,..that way it is all about building your rig the way you like it and skill as a player , NOT about if you have played hundereds of hours.especially since not a single player enjoys grinding the missions for weeks just to get to pvp to find you still are way outclassed in equipment .I really love this game, it could be great,.. but as is , it is a waste of time and simply not fun to play a long grinding frustrating unbalanced game.The developers are making a huge mistake becuase they can't seem to see that people just want to build and be creativew and fight against others doing the same NOT grind to make parts to craft more parts to grind more to sell buy something...if given the chance ,.. players would simply build whatever they liked and could fit into the power requirement and actually enjoy spending their time shooting up each other. Also it is rather silly to grind 280K worth of pvp exp to get most likely a blue wheel from a container ,after opening over 300 containers for example the best i got was 1 legacy harvester and a a stack of blue junk that when sold goes for about 50 or so credits.the fix would be to leave the spinning wheel but as you go it removes the items you have already won untill you have all the ones it offers, in that way the player is assured they will eventually get something out of it of value .Not much is more rage inducing as to play for 3 days to get 280k exp just to spin a wheel and get the white car jack ,..yet again ,.. and again and again.To sum it up ,.. this game could be a fast paced fun game that all could compete with , but this is simply impossible to have when you progress at a snails pace.Like most semi new players i look forward to the wipe and at least a few days of even level game play before the oppresive ecconomy and lack of rewards again crush the game for new players. Some might say "" but hey i see you rank pretty high on the weekly ratings blackstone , so why the complaints?""Answer because after 800 hours im strill limited in what i can build and play to the point where i'm frankly bored to death of playing the same low level equipment and one should not have to ""get gud"" for months against way overpowering opposition  to have access to parts to even try and see if you like them against real players .AGAIN, most players would be fine with letting ones building creativity and actual game play with that build against whater the other guy dreams up.Nobody enjoys the grind , nobody enjoys the added crap that really is not needed in this game to have fun and having FUN is the only thing that really matters in a game is it not?P.S.please note that there was a responce to my review by a developer a few months ago""Feb 10""in which he goes on to basicly lie to me and tell me the wipe is comming ""very soon"".2 months later here I am, sorry i believed him and kept playing for nothing but the same grinding boring frustrating game.

If it was free to play i would say its a great game, but currently its $12.00 at 60% off, and with only 3-4 PVP maps and 2-3 modes most of witch are lvl locked, its really not worth the time or money.

								I don't do reviews often (maybe ever?), but I have to admit I'm enjoying this game alot.  Yes I paid to play it in alpha, which if you wait, you can play it for free.  With that said, I'm glad I did get in early.  There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to building an effective build.  Does it take long to learn, a couple of days and watch a few videos on it, it's easy enough to get the hang of, it's just not World of Tanks or such, you have to build your tank instead of just unlocking the next one.It's fun right now, but when it goes open beta and free to play for everyone, that's where it's going to shine.  More real players, less bots.  Which if I had to gripe about something it would be the bots.  One game they are realy stupid, but other games they fricken take over and own everything.  But like I said, more people playing = less bots = more fun.  I used to be hooked on World of Tanks and games like it, this has finally pulled me away from WoT, probably for good.			"

								I had a long winded reason about why I was on the fence about this game but to be honest after hearing from the dev team and reading up on a few more things I gotta say.  THIS GAME IS AWESOME.  It's pretty, gritty, fast paced, voilent, explosive goodness that should fill everyone's vehicular rage niche.I really really really want to reccomend this game but for the most part I just can't bring myself to.  All in all the game itself is fun as all getout, has lots of interesting concepts, tons of customization options, very few bugs, beautiful graphics, awesome dynamic gameplay, and a pretty nifty progression system.  That aside it's really only fun for the first 10 hours or so when everything is new and exciting.  After the inital dive it gets grindier and grindier in true gaijin fashion with each successive tech tree requiring you to mash together a pile of parts from the previous tree, which (who would'a guessed it?) requires you to grind the same missions over and over. I do understand this is still beta and they are working on things but as of right now pvp is almost unplayable in some aspects for newer players.  Older experienced players stack vehicle parts of high rarity and literally drive circles around other players while spamming one shot barrages of missles, cannon fire, and bouts of flame.  That is, when you even get games with other players, most of the time you will play against bots even in pvp matches.  For the most part it has the makings of a great game, but as of right now it needs a lot of changes, attention, and work to be polished into something great. "

								NOTE: Game's going free soon. If you'd rather not pay, just wait and play as a FTP player to get a sense of how it is.I can't say I have a lot of time and experience under my belt. But, I'd just like to offer my two cents as a newcomer to the game. Here's to hoping some of it proves helpful on making improvements to the game.THE GOOD+ The sheer number of possibilities and combinations in building the ultimate killing machine entertains me for hours without fail.+ It never takes too long to find a match.+ The maps vary from situations that benefit CQB specified constructs to maps that long-ranged weaponry lords over.+ PvE/Coop game modes do make for some and intense moments. It's definitely enjoyable.+ You can shoot bots and your own vehicle while waiting for the timer to run out.+ Players can build their cars to fit their own niche playstyle.THE BAD- The AI is my major gripe. While every PVP mode sports some kind of 'capture zone' objective, the AI seem to have some kind of 'TDM/Moshpit' mode active. Less than a minute into a match, there are rarely any AI left because they drive to the center of every map and do donuts until all the enemies die, the timer runs out, they die, or the players deal with the objectives. I'd like to see some AI 'guard' their objectives (specifically in assault), and other push for the objective ALONG with AI that are in this headhunter mode.- The .50 cal turret machine gun spam is real, at least in lower tier matches. A lot of players in the lower brackets who sport 5 .50's end up racking up 5+ kills every time.- No VOIP. Not really a problem as much as it is a preference.- Objective completion seems like the ultimate trump card and the intended endgame for each PVP match. With the AI not caring a lick for the objectives, this means that your team could wipe all BUT ONE enemy off the board, and they can sit in a capfield while their AI horde keeps yours busy.- In a game where the AI is dumber than a sack of broken bricks, if the objective isn't captured then they're tallied to determine which team wins. So I have to babysit my braindead drivers or lose.- The physics seems extremely vindictive (what? lol) when it comes to your vehicle getting air. You tried to jump down a minor ledge? Don't have a jack with you? YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME.- This game seems to beg for an outright skirmish game mode. So why deny it?			"

(lv10 as of this review)the only thing missing is Racing, in my opinion.but over all i say that this game gets a 5/5 or a 9.2 out of 10.it is a must try if you like building.it is a must if you like destroying.it is a must if you like driving.it.is.a.must!

But the online with other players theres only you and 2 or 3 other people in the battle with you and the rest is just bots needs more active players. It would be worth the 30$ if there was active player to battle with. Other than that game is very enjoyable and i hope it grows.			"

								Picked it up during the Winter Sale since I heard that the item degradation mechanic was removed and I was quite hopeful, since the game looks quite cool. Unfortunately since I don't live in Europe or the US (the only places that have servers) I am always on a 400ms ping connection to servers, which is fair enough due to location. The unfortunate thing is that everything (movement, shooting, etc) is handled serverside, meaning that anything I do has a 400ms+ delay on my screen, making it unplayable. This is not my fault or theirs, although I cannot recommend this game to anyone outside those mentioned areas until servers are put in different areas.			"

								The difference in both strength and rigidity of higher level parts when compared to lower level parts is insane. This would not be a problem had the players would be matched with similarly equiped players and bots. However newer players such as myself are constantly being matched with much more experianced and better equiped players and bots. Since the game required that you win games to obtain parts to then use to create better parts, the experianced and strong will always be preying on the newer and not well equiped players, leaving the new players in a chain of losses and without the ability to progress (as you need to win to get parts).

								Not recommend at full price sale price recommend.All and al it's a great fun game. If you like building things to destroy other things and see if yours can be the fastest or strongest or more weapons. Pick and chose which weapons you want to use and placement. Paying $30.00 not on sale would be a mistake, waite till the game comes out to free to play. So at some point the game will end up being pay to win most likely a factor when new vehicles are released.Money can't buy you skills only parts so it's still anyone's game.The in game purchases total up to currently about $159.96 for 4 vehicles you get some game coins unique portraits (portraits have no value to any game stats, so mostly show or useless.) The weapon that comes with the vehicle. You also get paints that are for the parts, you could buy them in the in game player market, or get them from crates, lower chance to get the that way. much higher to get the from the market.  So you can get all of this from the player market, the vehicle design, you might need to just look up a youtube video how to make one. Match making the bots in the player vs player, or pvp for short. The bots have a much higher PS power score the ranking for each thing we build. The bots most time more than not have a much higher PS with almost 100% on most of these bots, they put bots in the place of other players to make a full game every thing 8v8. This is nice how ever if someone leaves then your down a team mate. Bots in game destroy when a new player is entering or about to to make room, so many times if you join a game fast enough you can be placed into the match. depends on the match and the players latest so far it let me join a mid game match so far was about 30 seconds into match, team was down some players and losing but some times that happens, not to often. more times when it places you in a match it's from the start, if not it's about 15 seconds or less into the battle. Some times it lets you join as a spectator and watch the battle till, you can join the next game. Currently the battles are 3 minutes long, but most matches it dose there for there is about 1 to 2 minutes or less in the battle, most times it's with in about 30 seconds so pvp are fast to join games. PS. just stay behind the bots, the go for the closets targets currently, so you still have a chance this is a big help to any current player new or old, or someone about to join the game to play it for the first time.pve player vs environment / raids. match making is very bad very long waiting times. Each raid can have 3-4 players. You receive one free repair kit to respawn you in battle. You can get more repairs kits from either making them in crafting for 50 copper currently, which can only be gotten from doing raids, or buying it from the market.  So if your out of them or a newer player it can make the difference or not. Prices will change since your buying them from the players selling them on the market, so one might be 99.00 the next could be much higher or lower, all depends on the market prices. Waiting times is very high. Most times out of 2 hours before they change raids you can only get about 2-3 if your lucky by the normal waiting in the queue to do a raid. If you group up with close in range of PS power score or have 3-4 players you should be ok to start faster. Might also be since the game is in beta and not as many players have the game since it's listed but as free to play but sent released as free to play yet. So lower play base is a factor with the queue system needs a lot of work, for both pvp and pve. GM's in game attack you in game if you say you posted or about to post a bad review about the game. When they agreed about the same points you had a issues with. When you've been waiting in the queue's and ask others to join you multiple times. Then later on gm attacks you saying you never asked for help when I did dose not seem right to me. GM's in game making jokes about them using cheat codes and other to try glitches in the game, showing others how to use the ban commands. Then Threatening to use them on you, not a good community. The game is just grind grind grind. Levels, parts, recourses some you can buy and sell on the market to make a good amount. For beta like most it has it's limits on thighs you can get per week. on recourses caps. parts and fuel, copper seems to be the few things you can still get with out any current limitations.			"

								I've been waiting for this game to come to Steam for some time now, it's finally here! Hurrah!A couple excerpts from the store page: ""In 2021 a mysterious viral epidemic known as the ‘Crossout’ swept the planet, countries and populations simultaneously began to fall at an alarming rate all over the Earth."" ... ""Twenty years have passed after ‘Crossout’. Humans still remember their life before the disaster. As always, there are groups trying to recover the old world, while others enjoy the chaos and destruction. But there are those who are not human any more. They hide their faces behind masks, and their motives are unknown""Your goal in Crossout is to survive this plagued planet by crafting parts from pieces which you have aquired either through battles or from the black market and then build and outfit your own unique vehicle.  The crafting system might look rather daunting to any newcomer but is actually rather simple and straightforward. You must aquire the specified parts from either combat or the blackmarket and continue to craft the item. Depending on the item it can take from 5 seconds to 120 hours for the item to craft, and yes, that is real life time. But don't fear, you can speed up this crafting process by using in-game currency which can be got by just selling parts you've gathered over time. The black market is run by the players. Have an item you wish to sell? Well chances are someone has set up a buy order and if you need the cash quick you can simply sell it there instantly, but usually the prices are really low so you can put the item up for sale with a price of your choice and wait for someone to buy it. Simple!The combat is usually very fast paced but can be throttled down a bit depending on your build. For example the players have created a sort of sniper class using either rockets/missiles or large caliber cannons at long range, there is a scope modification which can be aquired which really helps with this. There is also an exhibition tab in-game where players can share their vehicle builds with others. You can download those builds and use them. Now many people have been calling this game Pay to Win but in reality it is not, it is Pay to Progress. The packs simply move you ahead quicker but everything which can be got from the packs can be got from just playing the game, that is, asside from the avatars.All in all this game looks very promising and so far has been a blast to play. Here is my very first build made from scratch: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/447367542025090944/8A1364DD9E773F7B03B8E1EDFBA2EB8E1078D28E/tl;dr A crazy fun game and you should definitely give it a try. I'll try and update my review once it hits Open Beta Testing!			"

What is Crossout?   Crossout is an arcade styled build and fight game where you construct vehicles out of scrap parts and battle with other players or AI enemies. Battling rewards you with materials and parts which can be used to create other parts or sell them on a market. The market is very economy based with buying and selling prices. Usually selling parts yields tax which prevents players from exploiting the market. As you level up and build stronger vehicles, you gain affinity with four factions (Engineers, Lunatics, Nomads, and Scavengers). Leveling with these factions allows you to craft stronger parts at crafting benches (which you have to rent out).The good.   As of December 2016, the game costs around $30.00 for closed beta access. As the decription suggests; the game may go free2play next year so I dont recommend buying it at the moment, but it sure will be good when it is free. The graphics card usage and cpu usage is quite low for stronger cpus and gpus. This suggests that you dont need a high-end rig to play it, but you shouldn't play it on a potato. The graphics are decent considering the strength of the gpu needed. Battles themselves can get intense as different player designs yields different play styles. One player may have a melee based vehicle when another player may have a sniper based vehicle. There are a great assortment of weapons. from heavy cannons to explosive javelins, this game has so many weapon variants.The bad.   Sometimes the game may break and you loose progress or your account and you need help from the developers. Just so you know, the support is very bad. The devs refuse to help you and blame it all on you. If you continue to plea, they will keep denying it and give you false facts. The game itself can get a little repetitive. Build, fight, repeat. It's one of those games you play one hour, then break two hours.The verdict.Pros:-Almost priceless.-Well optimised.-Many play styles.Cons:-Bad customer support.-Repetitive8.5/10 "

								They limit how much scrap you can recive (weekly I belive). If u reach it you have to wait a cupple of days for it to reset to get any more (this ""may"" be for pre release only, even so its pointless to play when your at your limit). This makes crafting a little more dificult seeing as how you need Copper, Scrap, Coin and usuly 3 other item with multiples of them to craft 1 item, that is if its not the ones that need the extra wires, electronics, or fragments to make. When crafting items they have a ""build time"" before you actually get it. Nice idea but a little much seeing as how you only get the required material for a win, if its an item you'll only get 1 (if you lose, your lucky to get scrap maby some fuel if your outfitted for it and you dont die). Geting the item you need it will take a few attempts as each mission has random drop chance with 3 displayed items as a higher outcome. As for geting coins haha have fun (Having a player based market is somehing I dont and never will like).The AI needs a little love. Here are some examples that you tens to see in mission matches- The AI frendlys will continuisly push you around - They tend to get stuck on every thing- They will drive past enemy's and not shoot- They will rush cap making games even shorter - The guns and items they have tend to be to high or to low for your lvl (nothing like being rushed by 3+ bots with cannons on them ;P )I will say this tho, I am having a lot of fun playing the game even with the flaws. like most beta game needs a lil work. I am use to this as I mostly play alpha and bata games. That being said most of the bug will be fixed for when the game is open, untill then everyday will most likely have mix results. This may mostly be a negative review but I have changed my opinion on the game from a ""don't get"" to a ""must have"". As more things get fixed (balanced etc.) the game will only get better. Hope to see you in my gun sights ;P.			"

								Edit: The developer has been in contact with as I requested, I am eager to see how the final release turns out!Edit 2:After talking with the developer and learning a few tricks and an update I am happy to report that I have changed my review to a recommend.The positives about this game:The fighting is awesome, I found out that you can make in game teams so if you get three people that agree to fight with you, you never have to wait to do a PvE battle!The physics and damage are pretty fair, I haven't found to many weapons OP.There are now daily challenges you can do and daily and weekly crates you can get that fill some of the void of how to get items and scrap to make items.This game is all about building the best tank you can and destroying your enemies with it!The neutral about this game:This game is also all about grind, with level locks every step of the way and the sheer cost of everything to be crafted or bought in the market grinding is what you will be doing the whole game.However, if you were to ask me how to make grinding fun I would tell you shooting an enemies tires off then using a grain thresher on their car till it blows up, or cloaking a 105mm cannon to sneak up behind someone and show them how foolish it was to put all their armor in the front.This game has done something I found very hard in the past, it makes grind fun. So even though I find fault in level locking things and various other leveling related problems, I do not give it a negative score for that, because when you are in the swing of things you will look up and realize you advance three levels without noticing!The negative about this game:The marketplace is a little broken including everything being way over price and the fact it has a strange 10% tax for no reason.The Item Crafting is very broken! Remember what I said about grind: This is what is needed for crafting a 1st level ammo pack:2 - Basic 75mm cannons = 300 scrap each to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling2 - Basic Machine guns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling2 - Basic Shotguns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling50 copper = approx 7 a game x 3 average minute game time = 21 minutes of just fighting450 Scrap (none from the 6 guns we broke down to make this?) = 90minutesso 7 hours and 51 minutes of game play to make a single 1st level ammo pack, but wait it takes a real time hour to craft (again for some reason unknown to me)So the actual time is 7Hrs and 51 minutesNow, you can buy stuff from the market, there are daily challenges and seasonal ones to help with the cost, but I would like to ask did 8hrs sound like a good idea in development?Did someone grind to make an ammo pack to see what it felt like?If at anytime you decide not to make that item, you will not get 1/10th of the price back it cost you to make or buy those guns if you sell them.If you want to hook people for the long haul, add new things into the game, the whole game is about battling and it's fun as heck! Don't go for the cheap hooks like this, ditch the weapon requirement or at least make them make sense and you'd have a great crafting system.All in all the crafting is the only thing I really have a problem with now, and I plan on buying what I need from the in game market so if you are a person who does the same I highly recommend this game!If you like making someone wish they had prepared for your triple rocket launcher cloaking sneak attack that removed all their guns and half their armor, then this is also the game for you!Happy hunting!

								This is a really good game overall. It's a gaijin game though, so there are some pay2win elements but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference because the coin packs ingame are expensive af, so everyones grinds pvp matches and raids to make money selling crafted stuff on the market instead. Even when you are outclassed you can still win everytime with enough skill and good tactics. I haven't had any bugs or problems with the game other than some bad ai players that would get stuck often on certain levels rendering them useless teamates. The updated ai seems better now and they make less stupid mistakes but still needs more work.Hopefully the rough edges will be polished by the time the game is out of beta.			"

								6/10Its like lego.. build a machine and fight other peoples creations. Great!Just that the game is very unbalanced at this point. Ai bots get stuck in every hill the try to climb and the most of the game modes are unplayable bacuse of lack of players interest. Noraml race and ai raids are the only modes in play. The points system hands out points for kills, kills assist and capturing. The score you get wont represent your effort done, but rather how many lucky kill shots you got. Points should be based on damage done. Hopefully it will be fixed but i doubt it.Will give a thumbs up whenever this^ gets fixed. "

								I will start by saying I love the idea of this game and it could be great but I struggled with rating it! Until with get rid of P2W!! (Which they won't cause they only care about $$) I can't recommend it!! What ever happened to the good old days of actually working and earning great loot within the game!! Now anyone can just by great loot and own in the game which is a bunch of garbage in my opinion!!! I have no problem with people being able to buy cosmetics items but when you can just buy weapons that help you advance it ruins the game for me (especially in PVP!!) With all that aside though the building vehicles is great and I would really enjoy the game if there was more PVE missions and PVP could be great if they dropped P2W!! I know it is still early access but hopefully they can fix these issues because this game could be amazing!!			"

								Coming from Gajin Entertainment (same company that developed War Thunder),  I was hoping their newest release would address the serious issues that plague their other games....It does not...  Same broken matchmaker,  same unbalance, and the same poor support from devs...Another pay to win game that loses it's appeal after a few hours,  because after that once you surpass newbie equipment,  you're thrown against players 20+ levels beyond you.Teamplay?  Irrevelevant,  it's always the one or two people that buy all their equipment rather than earn it that dominate,  and suck the fun out of playing for everyone else...I'll admit,  the layout of the game is nice,  and it looks good...  but the servers are absolute garbage...  expect constant lag and frequent conection loss. (they're only interested in getting new players,  not keeping them...)Maybe I'm just spoiled on the great classic vehicular combat games,  like Interstate 76, Vigilante 8, Redline, and even Twisted Metal...  since then,  every attempt at a modern varient has failed horribly,  and Crossout is a prime example...Pass this one up folks,  the Russians still haven't figured out how to make a descent game yet...

								Utter garbage.This game was semi-fun at first but every time the developer pushes an update the grindwall gets taller and the game gets less playable.  When you actually use some of the parts you either bought with daddies credit card or had to grind for ages for, the AI cars get massive upgrades (top tier weapons that you can't hope to get) and one shot you constantly.  This had not been how it was until this week, my higher power score vehicles now face a massive imbalance in terms of AI enemies and it's made the game unplayable since AI is what you end up fighting most of the time, since the game seems to be shedding players like mad.Skip it, it looks cool but it's jury-rigged rubbish.

The devs just posted a few days back the OBT would be VERY SOON and then 5 words later they pushed the date 3 months or more...Will give a new review when Open Beta finally begins...			"

After transition into open beta, the game will be distributed via a free-to-play model.""The game itself is already in a f2p model and $30 is horrrendously high for what will later be free to play.

								This game so far is fun but i really dont recommend it to anyone. The main reason is balance. So far as ive seen this game is horrible unbalanced and you see too many of the same weapons being used. Case in point cannons, they are powerful and great for long range and do explosive aoe damage when they hit. And becasue of this there are alot of people with 2 cannons on their vehicles and they pretty much one shot you or destroy large amount of your vehicle.Dosent help that most games turn into 1v1 matches with stupid AI spinning in circles. There are so few players and it tends to be after a 30 sec to min wait join a match where its either just you and one real player on the other team or you agianst two. This game could be alot better if the made the AI scale based on the number of real players in a match. As in say its 3v2 thean the AI on the team with 3 real players would be strong, but the AI on the team with 2 would be slightly stronger to make it still a challege for the other team.Another is that actuall matches, they either turn into slug fests where whoever kills all the other teams real players win or who is fasted and capture the others base. And on that the base capture is too face, we are talking around 15 - 20 sec to capture. Too fast for anyone to respond or stop them.This leads to another is the resource grind, standard matches give a random white item (lowest level) and some scrap. The pve missions give better resources but they give you like 5 per match and requiring 50 just to make a blue item makes the grind really long. Especially since pve take a energy resource (fuel) and about a 2-15 min wait time to get in a match. This make getting to the higher teir weapons hard for anyone not playing constantly and it sucks more since you need 6 or more blue items that you have to craft to make a purple. Each blue cost 50 copper (pve mission only resource) and than even more coper to craft the purple item. This be alot easier if the lessened it to half the amount of blue items. Instead of 2 blue engines, generators and weapons coolers just make it one of each.All in all this game is fun, but horrible balancing, bad matchmaking and the grind just keep me from recommending it to anyone. And i know this game is technically still early access or beta but the fact they are charging for it and it still is so unbalanced and grindy, dosent leave much hope to the game when it launches. Im really hoping they fix these issues before the game comes out of beta bucause it is fun once you get past getting one shotted the second another player sees you. "

								So few people play this that I only encountered 3 other players in the 20 or so matches I went into. All of whom were so completely unbalanced for me that it just completely put me off altogether. It's like that scene in Idiocracy where there's that little pickup truck with a floppy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attached to the top and it's going up against the gigantic monster truck with the colossal♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped drill on top of it. Other than that, I'm sure there is some game hidden in there somewhere, but the grind-fest goes on far too long to see any of it. I found that I was spending a lot of time getting annihilated without any hope whatsoever of victory, attempting to get things I don't want or need simply because the game forces me to go through it to progress at all. Overall it was more pain than fun and even if it somehow pays off in the end that doesn't even come close to justifying the suffering. Games are meant to be a fun way to spend your time and a good game is one that draws players in very early into gameplay. This ""game"" has failed to deliver either of those. I immediately put in a request for a refund, because the $41 NZD this cost me is absurd, especially for a game that only has as much quality in it as you'd expect out of a free-to-play. Well, a bunch of people are going to harass me now. Probably not as many though as that disappointing Attack on Titan game, for which there were many crying fanboys.			"

								Early Access Watcher Reviews CrossoutUpdate Version: 0.3.2Disclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer.Gameplay Footage: 


YouTube™ Video: Crossout with The Mute Cynic - Early Access Watcher - 

			Views: 58		

			In 2021, Crossout eradicated a good chunk of the global population. Twenty years later, some look to restore the old ways, others flourish in the madness of the modern age.		

I have had very little experience with the publisher of this game outside a few hours spent playing War Thunder to varying degrees of success. The developer, on the other hand, is new on my radar. Each company has dealt with vehicular gameplay in some degree and it does transfer over (at least in regards to War Thunder) over to Crossout. It has been out for quite awhile and finally ventured into the Early Access program in the form of a paid entry closed beta, which is not uncommon when you look at previous adapters of the practice (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, SNOW). I have spent roughly 10 hours exploring the options on offer at the game's current stage and have determined that the game is surprisingly fun, but not worth the price of admission. Driving mechanics are manageable, but feel extremely wonky. I have tested many different vehicle types and they all seem to slide regardless of the bulk of the weight. This is thankfully balanced by the great physics concept used for crashes, impact and movement when over certain terrain. You can lose wheels, weapons and most of your car's frame during combat when you receive damage, which affects your speed, movement and can render you defenseless. Certain car parts can help negate some of these issues (auto-flipper instead of waiting 30 seconds) or more protective parts can be used around weapons to keep them from popping off. Weapon fire requires a line of sight depending on the weapon type such as shotguns not being able to fire if you are pointing them towards you. I find the driving annoying, but I am shocked to admit how fun this can make the overall game be.Gameplay is comprised entirely of the vehicular combat with Battles making up the PvP segment of the game. It is fast-paced deathmatch mayhem delivered in short three minute matches with a single life to fight on. Two teams will collide to either eliminate every player on the opposing team or capture the enemy/neutral base. Battles will be the best option for the time being due to the extremely long queue times for the Raid events. Battles can be populated by bots if players are not available and provides near instant queue times. The AI for the bots is a mixed bag especially when the layouts of each vehicle and the unevenness of the weapon's power can make some bots weak as wicker baskets stuck on their sides or absolute powerhouses able to carry matches. Other times it is hard to tell if the AI is just terrible at driving or a fault of the floaty driving mechanics. I would consider this a primary issue, but actually having the bots eliminates the problems with a low player population for certain game modes.When you can find enough people to do Raids, you are given a randomly selected branch of objectives ranging from gathering supplies, defending positions and defending convoys from raiders. They are purely PvE missions and require gas to participate, which is refueled daily. Daily missions provide additional scrap and Season objectives reward scrap and other items. Everything you get inevitably contributes to the ultimate objective: making an effective vehicle.Once you win a couple of matches the customization opens up to allow modifications to your starter vehicle or just build something original. You are reasonably limited to how many parts you can equip at the start and the right to add more pieces the higher you level up. The garage allows six degrees of freedom to get in close, allowing a more precise angle to slip parts behind finicky corners. Every key command is listed on the top of the UI and makes referencing painless. It is just a shame I have yet to find a way to change the keybinding for these options. Accidental deletion of a part becomes a frequent annoyance due to this dilemma, which makes the use of the undo key-combination crucial. It is semi-user friendly with the possibility for some outrageous designs as long as you have the part allowance to handle it. You can even test out your vehicle before risking defeat in combat. The underlying issue will be obtaining parts and the unpleasant means to get them. Parts and equipment can be crafted, won through matches or rewarded through crafted cargo containers (RNG Loot boxes) using rented out workbenches of your respected organization. You can also buy these parts using the in-game coin currency obtainable by selling items on the auction house or buying it outright. Special parts are also needed in the form of copper (Raids), wires and electronics (Battles) to upgrade select parts to higher tiers. This process can take a great deal of time and effort due to the wait required once an item is selected for crafting. It adds up the higher tier you decide to craft with the alternative of buying said items eliminating the endless farming. Enter the debate over pay-to-win or in this case, pay-to-quicken. The amount of time needed to create just one high tier weapon can be eliminated by either buying one of the packages with pre made vehicles or using coins to buy them. Coins can take forever to get if you only manage to sell what you get from Battles so the coins grabbed from the packages can eliminate that as well. Vehicle power does determine the type of players you can get matched with, but people can get into higher tiers by buying their way into it instead of farming endlessly to get the materials to make a powerful car. Time equals power in this scenario and skill can only carry you so far in a fight with a tank. My only gripe is the use of micro-transactions and paid packages in a paid game, but with it going free-to-play in the near future the issue I have will not exist. There are other issues I noticed in the form of connection issues and texture quality on certain maps, but I will generally found very little to consider game-hindering. The music is rather nice with some varied genres represented in the hub while the visual aesthetic remains pleasing to the eye (if not a bit dated). The number of maps and objectives available are decent. It is a enjoyable driving game with fast combat, albeit slow due to the downtime from the single life system. That being said, all of this does not justify the $30 price tag ($20 if you go through their website) and I cannot recommend it at such a price. It is best to wait until it finally hits free-to-play before trying this out; it will be more complete then. Pros- Fun, easy combat - Building possibilities for vehicles is vast- Visually decentCons- Micro-transactions pay-to-quicken- Bot AI + vehicle layouts = hit or miss- Queues can be atrocious for Raids			"

								Hi and welcome to crossout! In this game you build a custom battle machine from many different parts and fight other bots that other people have built. unfortunetly your bot wont be very good cause you just started and will be facing people with maxed out parts and weaponry, but dont be worried, after being stomped on by people and AI with much better bots than yours for about three days youll be able to get a new weapon! this weapon will still be♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to your competition, but good news! after you get 3 of these new weapons along with 6 more parts, (that will take you forever to build cause you lose about 80 percent of the time) you will be able to build a new weapon! Which btw will still be pretty crap cause you only have 1 purple weapon and no other equipment cause you just used it to build this purple weapon. But have no fear, cause after about 2 weeks of trying to get the parts you want by going through our terrible matchmaking, your stubberness will finally meet its match and you will most likely quite playing it regularly..... but think of it this way, we just made 40 dollers off you! isnt that great! Seriously though - This game has potential but is poorly executed$40 = low player base,Low player base + bad matchmaking = Getting Stomped onGetting Stomped on + no team play = 80% chance of loss 80% loss rate + when you do win theres a 25% chance of getting what you want if you win = Painful Frustrating GrindPainful Grind x repeditivity = RageRage + losing again and again = F this im going to play something else.I bought this game cause i was tired of the mess robocraft turned into and was hoping for something like that used to be, but was sadly disappointed, mostly because of the matchmaking.

It is set on a pay-to-win (P2W) structure. You can pay real money and buy boss equipment, that is P2W. The balance is for sh*t, non-existent.

								once you get past early game, some game breaking mechanics start showing up in a big way. Bullets pass through grill pieces, so players simply build the entire car out of grill and are 90% bullet proof. They then put augers and explosive spears on the nose of the car and tbone people while using invisibility. This game isnt so much tactical strafing and flanking but who has the best melee weapon on their car and has leveled up to have the most health. very dissapointing.			"

								I played for an hour, and requested a refund. TLDR; There's not that many players. So you end up Vs. bots a lot. What players you do find are bristling with guns and smack you down in all of 3 second due to guns and being 20+levels on you. Also I fell out of a map. Full review; As far as play, its akin to World of Tanks. Things are a bit floaty though due to the ""build it however you want"" as you can build your car/truck however you want. Want 2 wheels? Sure. Jet engines on a microbus, go for it! I made maybe 5 diffrent cars in my hour or so. I added guns, removed them, had 2 wheels to see if it would work (it does), shotguns, etc. Then you dump yourself into battle mode. Its either capture (single point) or base capture (you base, their base, more people on it the quicker you cap). Sadly, every game I was in was 70-90% bots. So it ends up either deathmatch, or you rock around to their base and cap as the AI cars just drive around. I say give it more time. Currently ... its meh. Middle of the road. But thats only after an hour for me. Rather play with more people, shout at folks, get teamwork going. If you like WoT, you'll probablt enjoy this ... but WoT is free and this isn't.EditHad to delete some of the more ... threatening replies.			"

								I really want to like the game.I have absolutely nothing against cash shops or dev's trying to make money. I have no problem buying a pack for early access. That being said, This is pretty much a Zynga game. For PVE you have ""Energy"" to limit how much copper you can get (An essential Resource). It also limits how much scrap you can gain in PVP, as well as how much reputation you can gain per match (The other 2 main resources.) There is no need for this. The dev says pay to progress as everything can be bought with ingame currancy, but i find that misleading.It's no longer pay to progress when you lock all progression behind walls labeled ""caps"". In addition to this the match making is based on a rating system that is so broke that 90% of matches will be you with blue or white weapons and every one else with purple and gold. It's pretty much an arena for whales to kill nubs. I really hate to say it, cause it could be the next chromehounds, but i mean come on. If i could get a refund i would.			"

Even for a soon-to-be F2P game this is too much.Terrible balance and everything is easy to exploit. High level players using strong weapons by building their car so they can play against low level players with high powered weapons, the Power Score system really, really needs a proper balancing.Too many suiciders in this game with grenade-spears, there should be a limit.The EXP gain in this game is tedious and a real ♥♥♥♥ing bore. No matter how high your score is, you can't get past 1200XP reward.Melee weapons do too much damage, cannons too little. When a car with aluminum plating gets hit by an 88mm it should barely be capable of driving. Missiles on the other hand, are too strong. Especially lock-on missiles. They need a nerf big time.I do NOT recommend the game, even in it's Beta.			"

								Right now I want to like this game, and I think it is a really cool concept.  Like robocraft, it has a great level of customization; but like robocraft, it is a grind-fest to get there.  This game, however, makes grinding impossible because a starting player won't have anything that can compete with the more advanced weapons and items and losing means you get next to nil for a reward. My main problem with the game, if it wasn't clear, is balance.  It tries to go off a point system that helps determine your rating, which goes into finding similar ratings to help put you in a fair match.  However, due to the fact that an advanced weapon can be included on virtually any level of rating, you are forced to put up with being outmatched before the game even starts.I've tried dozens of my own builds, and a few of the game's pre-made blue-prints that i've managed to gain so far, and none of them have helped to put me in an even match.I might could blame Pay-to-Win as being the culprit; but if the game was reliably balanced in its rating structure those payed for items wouldn't even matter.  So I'm not going to put blame on that.  Honestly, I'm conteplating paying for something myself; but maybe that was the devs intentions all along:  Put me in an unfair competition to encourage me to go the pay-to-win route.TL:DRThe game's rating structure is not balanced; but I REALLY REALLY REALLY want to like this game.  = (			"

								To start, Im taking a break from this game until they figure out how to balance the homing missiles.  IMO it breaks this game as every other weapon setup is to some degree skill based (wether it be using them or strategy when setting up your rigs weapons). A testament to its effectivness is how many people run with as many of them as they can pack onto a rig and honestly getting one banged by a spam/troll loadout is truly not fun. To some extent this also applies to the design of the uglier player designed vehicles as they are taking advantage of a wonkey damage model.  Im sure or at least I hope they fix that as well as it would be nice to play the game with more ""believable"" looking vehicles and not the rediculous looking monstrosities that people come up with in an effort to gain an advantage based on weak game code.Pros - Can be pretty fun especially at the beginning stages of your progression.  The game probably would not be as good as it seems if it wasnt for the building mechanic as its pretty rewarding to tweak a few things or build a ride from the ground up and do especially well with it.  The matches are action packed and if there was a decent chat or a lobby of friends it could be pretty epic as far as the teamwork is concerned.Cons - The balance, good in the beginning at lower levels but absolutly broken toward the latter stages of progression and its to the point where I will not play even though I have dumped money into its cash grab setup.  Thats the other thing and honestly from this outfit I was expecting it, the cash grab ""pay to win"" model.  Yes you can play without spending money but its designed to take it from you as no one will have the patience to play as long as it will take to unlock some of the things in game.  For all the ""I dont spend money"" guys out there think about this...how much total time do you play a game before your burnt out?  100 hours, 500 hours, more?  This is not arma where a fair amount of players have 1k or 2k hours plus and are still playing.  The pay to win model will take your money before you burn out and there probably is an actual estimated time for a customer to do that on any given game...unless you want to get owned the entire 250 hours you play before you leave the game for good.  They know you better than you do which is why the ""pay to win"" model is even finacially viable.BUT whatever.  Balance would fix this for me personally and I will surely change my review to reflect a more positive outlook on the game if that happens.  Again I will not revisit it until that happens but Ill keep an eye on the updates and give it a try later.			"

								A fantastic game on it's own. With already in early access several gamemodes that include PvE as well as player big mean bosses. The concept is great and execution for once done well too. Wacky designs that actually pack a punch when you underestimate them always gives you a laugh.However, that aside there are some serious problems that undermine it to the very core. And that is the grind... While longevity needs to be feasible and thus require a grind. This game takes it to a preposterous level and anything otherwise dismisses you to the player market, which takes a cut of every sale you make and hurt your profit to top it all off like a cherry. I mean, you have to craft tons of components in order to craft components to get what you want. This without taking into account the grinding for materials and the long real-time absurd crafting time or ""renting"" workbenches.The game still has potential though and I hope to one day change my review.

								I liked this game first days when I bought it. Nice system of factions and crafting, ability to buy and sell crafted items, scavenging and ofcourse BUILDING you dream vehicles. Awesome! Reasonable opponents and lot of fun. But after several evenings of gameplay either I become ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or other players ale online 24x7, but since I have still regular equipment, they are equiped with rare weapons and items, their ""cars"" looks like tanks and they kill me in three shots.No more fun, no more scavenging, no more crafting, because I'm dead most of the gameplay.So it is NO for me now - unbalanced game if you are not willing to spend days and night playing.UPDATE based on comments - yes, the unbalance happens when you reach level 10. Now I'm matched against tanks with purple miniguns or even golden MAMMOTH cannon. My poor car survives just a few shots.			"

								While i enjoy the mad max feel, i find the grinding for parts a little repetitve with little reward. The lack of Australian servers make it difficult to drive smoothly.  It also makes aiming a challenge as you dont shoot where to you are aiming - even though your target recticle is on the enemy doesnt mean the server has the turrents aiming there yet. Using the vehicle test drive feature, which allows you to drive client side, shows how the game could feel with a good ping.Pro:-Mad Max feelCons:-No Australian Servers-Grinding repetitve (needs to focus on build and design more to allow for build diversity)-Empty servers, mainly play with bots.This could be a great game if they fix a few things.

								very disappointing just save your money. there is no solo and you cant make a game for yourself or friends to play with you. cant play any DEF game mode doesnt let you join other players and you have to have 3 to 4 people to play that mode. online with random people for PvP is bad Very unbalanced rank matching and all PvP modes you dont have to play the objective at all its all team death match no matter what mode you pick. i do like the idea of this game and the building machenic for your vehicles was good but the physics in the game horrible. if possible i would ask for a refund if they dont change/fix all these problems.i wolud rate this 4 out of 10			"

								I wouldn't recommend this game for a couple of reasons:Number 1 - PAY2WINNumber 2 - The steering in this game is very dissapointingNumber 3 - There isnt much instructions or guidelines on how to build an effective vehicle so anybody who has purchased the tanks dominate the gameNumber 4 - Most games half of the team are botsNumber 5 - The game is divided between people who have spent money on tanks, who know how to play and dominate while everybody else has no idea what they are doing which is frustrating because when you do not win the game you recieve very little experiece which allows you to level up and get more parts (which doesnt even matter because everybody good just spends money to win and skips the grind)That is just my experience, it was not bad but I wouldn't recommend buying it and I doubt you will get past 50 hours on it "

								Update7: You shoot down the weapon from your enemy. You have full health. He cant do something so he do selfdestruct.. you have no points... a game for nothing. Thx for a free f...When you do the selfdestruct you have enough points for a reward.... wrong worldUpdate6: I go down to 1800+ PS  to find fair fights...white and blue weapons max vs lila weapons... ha ha...Update5: With 4700+ PS i see atm 80 % in matches only big turrets and missiles only(15 % melee). Thats balance... hahaUpdate4: ok i go back to 3000 PS. There where a few fair fights... and now a few one hit kills with 4-5 auger... I cant do the same with missle drone and shotgun... but i must investigate more power... arghs fix it d...Update3 : I begin to hate this game (with 4500+ PS) Turrets are total OP. One shot kill or two shot kill. Hurrican launcher... i hate him... no cover in near and my tracks are down and 50 % of my structure.. then i stand and can wait for my death.Shotguns are useless. drones too. Flying drones crash to much on buildings or walls or rocks.matchmaking is a gag. blue weapons vs orange weapons but lower PS then me but no chance...GrrrUpdate2 : When you have 4800+ PS you will be one hitted to much. Shotguns are useless. drones too (with this PS). Use 2 100 mm cannons or higher or melee only and your the king. Shotgun, MG and drone user are bait for all...More balance and a better matchmaking is needed.Update1 : Ok the matchmaking was now better. Not perfect but better.But its really better to do the same how under LvL 10. a 1vs 1 or 2vs2 with equal player and bots is better then one lvl with only high lvlOriginal : It makes fun. You level with bots what is a little bit boring but ok when no one is there as enemy. Better then infinite waiting.Later i have a lot of 1vs1 or 2vs2 matches (rest bots) with people who have the same vehicle like me.It was really funny and FAIR !!!I reach Lvl 10. I have a lot of fear before the repairsystem but i dont must repair (good. perhaps later but i hope not)I go with 11 in the next easy faction(Nomad?). Go into battle ... and must fight vs LvL 20 or 40 with LvL 11.The problem here is they have better weapons with more Dmg and better structure/armor. So you only have a chance when you have a good team and luck.I lost so much often now. Before i was really good...Sometimes the battles are extrem short because unbalanced...Fun is over...I really hope they fix the matchmaking fast. Then i am sure the fun comes back. But for the moment thumb down... respectively constructive criticism. I really hope they will be heard.I always edit reviews when i see changes.. I see the Devs read the reviews too and when enough say the matchmaking isnt ok i am sure the priority to fix will be higher.we will see and i hope and grind now my lvl higher with a lot of deaths ;)			"

								This game is very much in early beta. It lacks content and diversity. So despite its promise, right now I cannot recommend this game.- Maps are bland and all play the same- The modular bit is nice, but implementation is meh. It feels less like Mad Max and more like another LEGO game.- The grind is real. And boring.- Racing mechanics are pretty much non-existent. It's plays pretty much like low tier GF gameplay in War Thunder, only without the upgrades, views and strategy.			"

								This is kind of a weird review for me. Personally I love this game, the building is awesome and easy and really allows you to build awesome designs. But sadly for the price of $29.99 there are too many issues. the community feels very small as ive played with a variety of about 7 people. this makes just about every situation feel almost personal or annoying. The other night i waited almost 10 minutes just to get into a lobby just to get into a lobby with the timer at 0.00 and have to go straight back into the garage. To be honest I hate to not recommend  this game but I will not hold a biased either way.			"

								Basically world of tanks in terms of pay for coins to use in game to buy the best items possible. I would have no problem with this if they didn't charge you $38 (CDN) for the game outright. If i'm paying for the game I shouldn't have to pay for anything in the game to get the best possible items. everything should be able to be unlocked through normal play. Make it Free To Play and I would totally recommend this game as it's a lot of fun to play and has some great features.  Will not pay for a game that should be Free to Play.			"

I paid for this free to play game because I thought it looked like it could be an epic came but its crap. Different types of armour make ♥♥♥♥ all difference as they all seem to offer the same amount of protection. I wanted to make cool mad max looking vehicles but anything that can actually survive a battle looks more like a ♥♥♥♥ing scrap heap.very disapointed.

								Spending coins in the market is addictive. Part of me wishes I could buy more and the other part is glad I cannot at this time. The only drawback to me at this time is it is still working on creating balance between power levels as 3k power score one vehicle is not the same output as 3k on another. It is still coming along great and much fun.___---update to review--____I do enjoy this game a ton. I want a butten for how i feel as no is not the best answer, Unfortunately they have added a new battle mode for clans only. Doing this mode is the only way to get a new resource needed to craft new items. That would be ok if the item could only be used in the clan battles. Game is still a work in progress so I hope this gets fixed as at this time the developers answer to the issue is to tell players to buy the resource from other players who are in clans. Buying things in games should be about convenience and expedience not for things you have been excluded from players by their design.  By doing this they are dancing far too close to the pay to win line, even if they payment is being made to other players. I would say try this when it comes out of closed beta when its free and see what you think but I would not advise payment until this issue is better resolved.			"
