												-1/10This game is the definition of abomination.Starting with the Game name and ending with the fact that NONE of the minigames work properly:-you can't barely play any of them not talking about a win. -Rеtаrded humor of 12 y.o. meme master and horrible OST. -Oh and about those hideous songs - there is no option to turn off the music and to lower the volume, and those songs tend to start multiple times at the same time so you just kill yourself trying to finish the suffering. -NO other options in the game but windowed/full screen and turn on fps boost.-Epilepsy

												This is depressing. Has social media warped peoples minds so horribly that this is now acceptable? This is everything that is wrong in videogames. I can't even be upset at Valve, Greenlight is a trap for crap but it is literally a loud flashy meme inspired lazy attempt at being humerous just for a shameless cash grab. This is a game, published and ""Developed"" as artistic design? I think not.Gaming used to mean something, but when a generation of underdeveloped kids raised on social media nose deep in a cellphone cant seperate message boards and youtube poop from anything else in life, do they even know any better?But memes guys. It has 1 achievement for loading the game up. Supports badges but seeing how♥♥♥♥♥♥lazy this ""title"" is Id expect the extra shill. The insult to humanity known as the developers of this knew they wouldnt be getting much out of it. It is also mostly in broken english and russian. Of course it is.			"

STARUSHKO LUB seems to take pride in being one of the worst games I've ever played. It's only achievement questions my sanity while my sanity questions my life choices. Upon launch I'm met with extremely loud music that begins playing over itself. The full-screen mode does nothing except add a huge black border to the game window.I honestly have no idea what I'm doing as navigating the menu is extremely difficult. From what I can tell STARUSHKO LUB is an abortion of mini-games where the text is mostly in another language or broken English, so I don't know what to do other than quit and lobotomise myself.Why is this allowed to exist?

												STARUSHKO LUB is a game that I can't recommend because:- it doesn't worth the money- it has bugs- the graphics are horrible- the soundtrack is pretty annoying- it has no humour- the options menu is incomplete- the only good reason to install this game is for the trading cardsA little shout out for achievements hunters, it has only one achievement. ^-^			"

												I won't recommend this game if you wanna but it. Nothing in this game is worth playing. It's just crossing the street. It is good for achievement hunters though. If you get iit for free. It's worth itit. Just one achievement to complete 100% the game. You just have to start it. :p			"

												*Note: Even though I received this game for free, even if I did purchase it... my review wouldn't change in the slightest*When I first saw this game, I thought it’d be one of those fun little games like “There’s Poop in my Soup” which would be funny in a certain way. However, after playing for a few minutes this quickly isn’t the case and here’s why:Pros:♦ Great for Achievement Hunters (Only has one Achievement, achieved for opening the game. So if you want a completed game on your profile, then this is an easy one to do so)♦ Has Steam Trading Cards (This is good and bad. Good as the cards make up for some of the cost of the game. However, see cons for the bad)♦ Great for trolling friends (If you have friends and want to buy them a bad game for a laugh, this is the game)Cons:♦ Graphics are terrible (May fit the game, but they could be better)♦ High epileptic content in Undeath Classic Starushko Lub and Remake HD when you die (This is 100% terrible as there are no in-game warnings only slight warnings on the store page, written in a way that it makes it sound less serious and more of a joke… when it’s not)♦ Half the game is in poorly written English and the other half is in what seems like Russian (This is bad as the English grammar is terrible and the Russian doesn’t seem to fit in with anything)♦ Back to school mode doesn't make any sense (You can enter anything for the first answer and nothing for the next answer and the game seems like it’s broken. Then after you wait or try to enter an answer for like 2 minutes it randomly says some unfunny and random rubbish)♦ Back to school mode slanders you (This is weird and uncalled for. The slandering doesn’t fit in anywhere and isn’t funny)♦ Completing a mission happens randomly (It randomly says, ""Mission Complete"" for no reason or explanation)♦ Hitbox is off in Undeath Classic Starushko Lub and Remake HD (This is annoying and makes it almost impossible to play these game modes)♦ Completing mission ""Babushko Tale"" takes you back to main menu and overlaps music (Very annoying as it makes the music twice as loud and annoying. Also, there is nothing for winning except some text and poor music) ♦ Always on top (When in Windowed mode if you open another program, the game will always be on top. This is annoying to say the least as you must minimize the game to open anything else)♦ No tutorial for any game mode (It’s fun to work out how to play as that is an element of the game, but the least they could have done was tell us the controls or brief objective. This is because some game modes make no sense as to what you’re doing and then after you randomly click things and press buttons you win for no reason)♦ Options menu is weird (Only option is to put the game into 30fps which claims to improve performance… which isn’t entirely correct. Also, the toggle switch is hard to tell if the option is on or off)♦ Only one Steam Achievement for opening the game (Annoying because why even have achievements, if the only one is to open the game?)♦ Tries to be satire, funny or troll (Poor attempt that just isn't funny in the slightest)♦ No replayability (The game is that poorly made and there is no incentive to even want to replay it after the first time you open it)♦ Steam Trading Cards are impossible to collect (This is because you will never play the game longer than 10-20 minutes, if that)♦ No way to know or change the controls (Can't use WASD to move in some modes and other modes have weird controls and figuring them out can be a challenge. I figured them out by button mashing)♦ Sound/Music is way too loud and no way to turn it down within the game (This is bad because you don't expect the music/sound to be as loud when you first open the game and you can't mute it or turn it down from the game menu. Only way is to turn down your speakers/headphones which is annoying if you want to listen to something else whilst playing, you can't)♦ Won't get your monies worth ever (This seems like a game that a kid made in 30 seconds and is trying to sell it)Overall, even though this game is meant to be funny in some way or another, it didn't make me laugh in any way shape or form. Therefore, this game is not worth the 99 cents in any way due to being unfunny, unfun and poorly made. Hence, as there are more cons then pros, I can't recommend this game and you will not get your monies worth. However, on that note, if you want to buy it for your friend as a troll gift... then this would be perfect.PS: I only played 10-20mins for the review before I tried the whole game and got bored. The other hours/play time is from farming the Steam Trading Cards.			"

												On this day exactly five years ago, I almost got my grandma ran over by a bus when crossing a road together (she insisted we cross on a red light and I didn't protest). I still remember that because it was such a close call. Having such practical, hands-on experience, I can authoritatively say that Starushko Lub is not the real deal. Also the math minigame isn't working.			"
