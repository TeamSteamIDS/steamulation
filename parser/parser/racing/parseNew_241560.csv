												Well. The Crew... I honestly was dying to get this game, and I dropped the $85 for the gold edition. I figured since I loved racing games to death that this would be the perfect fit for me. But boy was I wrong. I do have a lot of fun on it but beware, the car physics are horrible and the map is sub-par at best. You get this hype from looking at the game that it's going to be awesome with a gigantic map and tons of cities to drive through but then you get in and BAM, there's only 2 cities that are slightly like 10% close to the historic scale of it, and those two are LA and New York. The problems with those are they take up 1/4 of each region they're in. West Coast: 75% nothing, 25% LA. East Coast: roughly 40% New York and 60% Hills and forests. The handling in the game is sub-par too, which I kinda braced for knowing it was on a havok engine. But when you really get into it it's one of the single most disappointing things in the game. Most of the cars either handle like you're steering them with your feet or handle like you crank the wheel over on each turn even if you're trying to only follow slight contours in the road. +The cars are nice+The map is still nice despite the major lack of any cities between New York and LA+Bonneville Salt Flats is acutally made to a barely historic scale (only for the speed area)+Street cars handle pretty well+Circuit cars are hilarious+Circuit Silverado+HUMMER-Miserable offroad physics because of the vehicle flipping limitations, Raid car physics leave a lot to be desired-crash cutscenes are the most annoying things ever and tend to take ~15 seconds to go away-Missions are subpar at best-Campaign is linear and not even racing-some of the fastest cars in the game are some of the slowest performance cars (Koeniggsegg Agera R: 279 mph fullstock (amazing buff), and 219mph level 1299 perf tune. Real/recorded top speed: Nowhere near any of these at 263mph)-Between LA and New York the cities are horrible and very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 90% of the giant cities that rival LA are just represented as small towns (Dallas, Washington DC, etc...) -A lot of major cities aren't even represented in the game (Houston, Phoenix, Glendale, Palm Springs [I know it's in the game but that's like one house, palm springs is a pretty nice place], Denver, etc..)-The game feels like minimal effort was put into it.--Crashes every 1-3 hours, usually during something important like the end mission or a skill--Graphics depend too heavily on shaders and shadowing, not real effort and modelling skills.-Cops are kinda annoying but really not bad any more, updates changed the police and made them hilarious golf balls for Hummers.-Tuning the H1 to Raid spec is horrible because it tunes it like a gas engine. The Duramax LLY diesel tuned to 600hp on a would NOT have only 700lb/ft of torque, it would EASILY be in the 4 digits (around 1,150ft/lb) for torque and it would be unstoppable. Work on diesel engines, then it gets my vote (granted it's an extremely small gripe because I still love the H1 to death ingame)-Mapping is horrible, around Black Mount there are patches of trees floating 5 feet off the ground and trees growing in the middle of the train tracks that the train just drives through, and in New York the storm gutters in the tunnels underground have no collision meshes and your wheels get stuck underground if you hit that area.My personal thoughts on this is they should put it as an early access game, not a full release game. This release is just.. For lack of better word, it's just not good, it's an incomplete game marketed as a full game. If they announce they have no plans to do any major revamps I would never recommend this to any of my friends. All in all, The Crew pretty much turned out to be exactly what I hoped it wouldn't be, and that is just another overhyped game that isn't worth the money, destroyed by Ubisoft forcing the game developer to cut a lot of corners and release a broken gameEDIT: My view of the game went up a lot with the addition of the Mini with a circuit tune and a Ford Focus with a Raid tune (the 2 funniest cars in the game now) There were plenty of updates after that but I have neglected to mention them, but it's still not worth paying the full price for, anyone interested should get it while it's on sale.Another edit: They fixed a lot of the AI issues, the races are extremely easy to win now if you play your cards right. The cops are like golf balls for Hummer golfing.Still not worth the price tag, though.Thank you for reading.The game is getting better but it still leaves much to be desired.EDIT: 1/27/2016 Also since Wild Run released the game WILL NOT run AT ALL for some reason.EDIT 11/23/2016 I fixed it and it runs fine, still the same issues and fun things though. Again, not worth the money whether or not it's on sale. UBIsoft even tried to give it away.			"

├Professors Review┤Game Pros • Open World • Day/Night Cycle • Large selection of cars • Multiplayer • Tons of cities and areas to explore • Car customization • Weather System  Game Cons• Basic storyline (Takes a very short time to beat, 1-3 days max depending on how long you play)• You can sometimes get disconnected from the server (After a long race, it sucks)• Handling is quirky (After some upgrades it gets better)• Some races make you rage quit (Not really a con. Just fair warning)• You can only see up to the 7 closes players to you. Which makes the ""MMO"" title feel lacking.Relateable Games • Forza 5 • Project Cars • Burnout Paradise ConclusionOverall, the crew is a really good racing game. If you're looking for another one to get into, I'd highly suggest this one. Not just for racing, but also the exploration factor. With all the time i've put into this game, I havent even seen 75% of the map.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)Looking for more steam friends? Feel free to add me! "

												This game can be summed up into two words, ""Wasted Potential"". The Good- Large detailed map than can be driven for hours on end with little to no repetitionThe Bad-Sub par car selection-Car/Driver levels are pointless as all races/racers will scale to you- Cheap AI features that borders on cheating/hacking, they can move at impossible speeds, plow through obstacles with no slowdown, will rarely spin out while a slight nudge will send you flying-Bad navigation system, so many times the navigation system will point me to an off-ramp only to curve back onto the highway, or will direct me through obstacles including wallsSimply put this is a lazy attempt by the devs, they did not put proper effort to make this game fun. Instead they took the cheap way out and its more frustrating than fun. It is not an MMO. They intend to  fix the problems but this is just another game that follows the disturbing trend of releasing unfinished games for full price then slowly fixing it to be what it should have been. I wish i could get a refund and spend the money once I  see a REAL COMPLETE game but i guess i just have to hope they actually do what I paid for.EDIT: Please remember the history of the game that when i wrote this review it was a buggy mess, there have been updates and changes to it but I for one am finished with this game for now.

												Over time and what not, Ivory Tower corrected some of the issues. Corrections are written in italic after each section. Enjoy reading!After more than 70 hours of playing this, this is what I observed:""RACING-MMO""? Announced as an Massively-Online-Multiplayer-Game, a single Session only holds 8 Players. ALSO: Uses NAT-Connection system. A player who is not in your region won't necessarily be able to join your session. The Crew (Steam Worldwide)? Yeah, sure. (April 2015: They improved matchmaking, merged PvP-Lobbies and improved game hosting, it's basically faster now. No other sewere issues were changed online-wise.)CARS: This game holds a breathtaking amount of 27 cars + DLC cars. And they are not even available in every spec. Test Drive Unlimited 2 had 130, for comparison. They also handle next to nothing realistic. Muscle cars have better grip than a BMW. RWD, FWD or AWD? No difference either.(March 2015: Handling SEVERLY improved, more and more specs got/get added every month. April 2015: More specs added, Raid DLC pack added.)ENVIRONMENT: Pretty neat. Animals. People. Cannot be touched but still a nice additon (That's Ubisoft Reflections for you there --> Driver:SF). The Map is huge and even after 40 hours of normal play time you wont even have it explored half-way. Environment is a huge plus here. Very good. 7.8/10 because there's too much undetailed water. (March 2015: Water updated, better reflections, realistic depth effects and more natural colours.) Yes, I am seriously criticizing water. It looked horrible back then, believe me.TUNING: Well, yes. Better than Rivals. Not as good as Underground 2. It's not bad compared to other recent racing games and you can tune your car just enough to be ""individual"". Severe Lack of stickers. (March 2015: This game is OVERFLOWING with a giant variation of stickers!)AI AND POLICE: THE RUBBERBANDING IS REAL. Ivory Tower SERIOUSLY managed to make a rubberbanding system 1299 times WORSE than EA. It doesn't matter if it's a Crown Vic, F-150 or Corvette. Cop cars have astonishing speeds of up to 250mph (400kmh), weigh about 30 metric tons and can seemingly drive through traffic, other cop cars, YOU if they want to, and can make objects in their way such as fences merely DISINTEGRATE. Also, if you're too far away, they just fly to you. Really neat. It's impossible to outrun a bunch of Lexus Sedans with a high-end Ford GT. The cops either keep up with you for 20 minutes straight or magically stop chasing you after 10 seconds. Sometimes they jump. Sometimes they fall through the ground. But most importantly, a CROWN VICTORIA can just BRAKE and STOP in front of a HUMMER H1 WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY STOPPING THE 4 TONS HUMMER H1 IN UNDER A SECOND. Oh, and the cops bust you in like 3 seconds. Also: If you're under 30mph, you've got next to no chance of escaping the cops. (March 2015: weight-Issue corrected! Police cars weigh about 1.5 tons as they should and you are able to escape them too, pursuits are A LOT more fun now. 3-second-bust not changed. Disintegration and teleporting still exists too.)IN-GAME-MONEY: Not enough. There's just not enough. Everything is overpriced, the game is almost dragging you towards its microtransactions. 40000 Crew Credits for 6$. You're not even able to buy a car with these 6$. 40000 is nothing. You can buy 4 good vinyls with that. Stickers.ALMOST. THEY ALMOST HAD IT. IT WAS OKAY FOR LIKE A MONTH AND NOW THEY CUT THE FACTION REWARDS BY FRIENDS IN HALF. RIDICULOUS.April 2015: YOU GET EVEN LESS NOW! WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥!CONNECTIVITY: As I mentioned before, terrible. NAT-based. Lag Simulator 2014. There's a pretty high chance you can not play with anyone outside of your region, depending on your NAT-type.SERVERS: UbisoftGRAPHICS: Pretty good...? Textures not too great, and I'm not talking about the world. Your characters jacket looks like it's from Just Cause 2. No mirror reflections in first person mode. Alternate graphics in first person mode, increasing SSAO. Might cause frame drop on older graphics cards. Framerate absolutely awful compared to other games. Distant textures --> Assassins Creed: Unity. Texture filtering? Not really.This game is still unfinished. IGNs 6/10 is completely justified.Polygons 4.5/10 is still justified.My rating below based on my listed points in this review:MMO-Aspects: 4/10Cars: 6/10Environment: 9/10Tuning: 6/10AI and Police: 2/10Online Features: 3/10Graphics: 6/10Overall: 5.1/10  (This was the initial release score I gave The Crew)6.2/10 (Early March 2015)5.4/10 (Early April 2015)As you can see, the score didn't really improve much over time.This game is in the Top 3 Worst Releases Of 2014 in my opinion.They are all Ubisoft. How depressing.And yes, I'm kind of still playing it after writing this (negative) review. They continue to add more content (that should've been here by release but whatever) so that kinda keeps it going. Will edit each month or so.I LIED. I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THIS ANYMORE. "

												Well, that was The Crew...After about 42 Hours ive seen the most things, beat the Campain and most of the Challenges.I bought ""The Crew"" with Hope for a Game that would be as entertaining as ""Test Drive Unlimited 2"".If you played that before, you will notice the similarity, many parts of TDU2 are also in The Crew. Sounds good right? No, not at all.Short Pro+Contra List on bottom of the Review What they both have in common is for example that the Police Cars are either always faster than you, regardless if you drive 100 km/h or 300 km/h or give up after 100 meters for no reason at all... Also the AI and Catch-Up-Systems during Races are equally bad. Other than that,Test Drive Unlimited 2 had probably over 130 different Vehicles, from many different Brands The Crew has maybe 40? (Until Ubisoft will add more DLC Cars for extra $$$)In Test Drive Unlimited 2 you had 1 small and one big Island as Gaming Worlds, Ibiza and Hawaii. The Crew offers 1 Map, a minature version of the United States.When the Servers at Test Drive Unlimited 2 are down, you can keep playing your Savegame in Offline Mode.  When the Crew Servers are down, you cant even Launch the Game.Test Drive Unlimited 2 offered a lot of things to do, you were able to go to a Driving School before races, to make Racing Licenses, to buy Houses, Cars, Bikes,Furniture for your Houses, you were able to customize your Avatar with clothes, Haircuts, Makeup, Accessoires. Also there were more design options for the Cars as well.It was possible to go to go into the Houses, walk around, similar to ""The Sims"". You could visit other Players homes, take Photos, there even was a Casino where you could play Blackjack, Poker, Slotmachines with other Players... and a few other things. The Crew doesnt offer much, dull and short Story Races, there are nice Cutscenes, but the Story itself is rather dumb.  There are also PVP events where the fastest Car always wins, nevermind how bad the Driver is..., Fraction Missions, Skillchallenges, Sightseeing and not really many customization options. BUT: At least you will have fun here, when youre able to drive around the Map with a Friend!While i played The Crew, i often asked myself how awesome the Game could be, if it was also developed and published by Atari and Eden Games.Ubisoft delivered, as expect, another Game that feels unfinished, like they stopped the developing Process at the Late Alpha Stage and just published it to cash in, for next Years ""The Crew 2""?For example, you sit inside your Car, the Driving Mirror and Side Mirrors dont show anything, They are just grey. Same goes for the Racing Wheel Instruments. They were supposed to show Speed, Gear and RPM, but they also just show you a fantastic grey bitmap.Only a few Cars have an Animation for a Gearshifting Character. Inside most of the Cars, the Avartar just keeps his Hands on the Steering Wheel and the Gears shift magically.  There are probably a few more little annoyances, but those points are already unnecessaryI would expect that from an early 2005 Game, but not from a 2014 release.The Things i liked about The Crew,  were the incredibly detailed surroundings.You see NPC's walking around, like a beggar moving his belongings in a shopping cart, Prisoners knocking stones in front of a Prison, Planes and Helicopters flying around ... and many more realistic Daily Life Events.The Map is filled with Wild Animals, they move a bit strange, but are still a nice addition.Also the Animated Sky looks really nice. What else is left to say? Yeah. The Cars.While Test Drive Unlimited 2 had a very good balance and Car selection, The Crew's Cars are very unbalancedThe Crew got a bunch of overpowered and ugly (My opinion, yes.) American Muscle Cars. They look like they weight 5 tons, have the aerodynamic values of a Brick Row House, but got a surreal good handling and can easily outrun a Lamborghini.  Thats just plain dumb. Besides that, there are a handfull european and asian Cars. But yeah they are the minority in this Game. The Handling of the Cars alltogether is good, mostly. The Handling of the Offroad Vehicles can be very frustrating.For sure this wont be any fun playing with Keyboard and Mouse. Pro and Contra for the Lazy People: + Very detailed environment (Working NPC's, a lot of Wilflife,,...)+ Better Graphics than Test Drive Unlimited 2+ Detailed Leaderboards and Statistics for everything+ Good Car handling and controls, with a few exceptions. + Open World, you can drive wherever you want~ Servers are down for Maintenance regulary, and when they work, it can happen that you still dont see any other Players.- - Uplay Launcher- Sometimes the ""Play with Friends"" Option works, other times it doesnt work at all. - No Offline Mode- Rather small Fleet of Cars- Unrealistic Engine Sounds- Missing Animations for Cockpit Mirrors. in some Cars also for Gear switching and Steering Wheel Speedometer, non funtional Indicators- No possibility to add your own Music- Boring and monotonous Storymode, Races are too short.- Not many Customization Options- The Crew was announced as a ""Car MMO"", but there are only up to 8 People in one Session.- No changing weather conditions (Except of Snow in the Mountains.)- Microtransactions- The Cars look great, but some of the textures of trees,bushes,... and the water look rather bad.All together i would say, ""The Crew"" has nice looking Cars, but it isnt the big next Generation Racing Game that was announced and promised.Its good for cruising around with Friends (If youre lucky enough to get a connection..) , to find out a few things about the United States, but in the Main Category ""RACING"" it lacks a lot.  You can pick it up when its on sale for 20 Bucks, its not a completly bad Game but i can not recommend it for the full Price.  "

Alright, here we go... Take your time reading this. If you are still confused whether to buy this game or not, go ahead and start reading. ""TL; DR"" may occur. Scroll down to the ""Verdict"" and “Pro & Con” to see my final words.This game is still reasonably okay, what's with everyone? Let me explain why this CAN be a fun game:What they have been expecting was this game to be as super as it was marketed; like those people that claim that have never heard of hype-trains before. But the core element of the game is enough. This game has a bunch of minor flaws that e.g.: Microtransactions, and deceptive speed perception.I can satisfyingly say that as a sim racer (mostly playing Assetto Corsa, GSCE, rFactor, Project Cars, etc.) this game is a decent arcade racer that allows me to use my G27 wheel with good FFB (for an arcade game) in a cockpit camera (yes, the driver is only turning 180° of the steering wheel, but you can use your full 900°; just like in DiRT Rally). 'Been playing this game co-op with a friend, driving for 8 hours STRAIGHT through the U.S. Of A. and we are still not done with discovering, not even at the slightest. AND, bugs are mostly gone... (or reported ones I have not encountered, yet).What I have been determined to do was:-- driving to explore, -- to have fun with friends escaping the police, -- and driving a few races here and there; Let me tell you... it is good at that.What? ... You expected this game to be an ultra realistic driving game with an open world just because you read ""simulation"" in the tags on the store page? -- Yeah, with expectations like these you are wrong here, entirely. Yes, cars may drive sluggish with a gamepad, but I cannot confirm that entirely. It might have been the assists, an older version, or their own gamepad (again, I don't use a gamepad, I stick to a wheel). BUT, what I can confirm is that driving fast seems to be visually slow (for me only when I drive with the rear camera views). Although, that feeling stops when I change the view to the hood or cockpit camera. Don't think I'm trying to command you to now play the game in cockpit view (because that is personal perspective), but to try it out at least, or accept that the game's visuals are deceptive. You may compare this game with Test Drive Unlimited 2,I can already hear that you are screaming out loud that TDU 2 was a good. Sure, these two games are extremely similar:A galore of land to explore (it is not 100% accurate to the USA, but WTF, the game is still HUGE),Multiplayer that had you roaming with others,or even competing in challenges with 'em,it allowed customisation of your car,cop chases,Don't compare this to Project Cars (or any other try-hard sim-cade/sim) for example...-- This game just lacks the physics,-- Project Cars has the sole purpose of organised racing (the game is not about street racing, ramming, and cop chases),-- and a career that has no background whatsoever. Do you smell something fishy here? I do, let me tell you:The game is not a ""10/10 best game ever"", but this is a decent game, it has potential that it builds upon. People have to distinguish between this and the ""hyped-up version of this game (the one on E3). Yes, Ubisoft has failed at that part; miserably. Bragging with their ""revolutionary new MMO racer"", though, in the end it just being ""vanilla"" -- but a good one at that! The game also had huge bad mouthing due to the epic-failing AC Unity and WATCHDOGS.Adding microtransactions to your game whilst being an AAA is never a good idea, I agree. But the thing is (unless it is a car you really want) you can buy it for about 2 bucks, it is not that much. You are also given 100.000 CP (Premium currency) at level ten to buy yourself a bunch of cars (three at least). There are not that many cars to buy when it comes to cars that have to be bought with real money. With the ""Wild Run Expansion"" that is to add even more content (Drift cars, Dragsters, and Monster Trucks) there is actually something to enjoy again soon, this may also incentivise portions of the community as well.Graphics are looking well, the game runs at Ultra settings with 60 FPS (R9 270x Sapphire and i5-3470 @3.20GHz multi-core); only Anti-Aliasing is reduced to FXAA. The sounds of the cars are just as good as they were in TDU 2, might even compare them to DiRT Rally. The Crew should be regarded as a successor to the TDU series, for Atari has faded away due to bankruptcy.Okay, now let’s talk pro and con:Pro:-- The Crew offers a huge map to explore -- Cop chases-- The body of a car is highly customisable-- Each car has a number of different setups e.g. “Performance”, “Dirt” or “Street”-- Easy to acquire performance parts [a lot of them]-- Grinding is almost non-existent (just play the game; you’ll see)-- A demo that allows you full access for two hours-- The faction system keeps you busy after the story-- Amazing sound for an arcade-racer-- Much longevity to it if you are into the aforementioned activities-- Good graphics -- (The Wild Run Expansion will feature a complete graphics overhaul)-- Fun cruising with friends-- AI is of little focus; the focus only lies in the cops-- Finding new playersCon:-- The speed indicated seems to be exaggerated (for most people)-- Physics (mostly when falling from a cliff) are way too sluggish and heavy-- Visual tuning is limited e.g. colours, vinyls.-- You can only select from a pattern of vinyls, not individualise-- Gamepad controls/Keyboard controls have been reported being “icey” and “skatey”-- AI is just… “meh”, it sometimes speedhacks just like in MW, Carbon, etc.-- AI is of little focus; MMO.-- Finding new playersVerdict:So, again, if you look for a challenge against AI (like Need For Speed MW, Carbon, Underground), a fantastic story and crews around everyone that battles each other in The Crew this game is not for you. But there is still a thriving PVP mode, an amazing Faction system that keeps you playing after the Story. You will struggle with the AI being just bad at driving and sometimes pushing you off drastically. But if you are looking into a long (sadly cliche) story with nice coop missions, have interest in cop chases, driving about with friends, competing against your friend, aka. ""roaming in a racer"" You should ONLY get this game on sale, don't pay 60$, it is not as good. This game has just been marketed falsely… But c’mon, how many games offer a demo such as great as this one to showcase its potential? Get the demo and judge it for yourselves.			"

												The Crew is an alright game, if you are into racing + mmos. The only problem I'm concerned about, reading on internet, is that microtransactions WILL be available later in the game (the CC currency). As far as I know, there's a huge difference between the bronze and golden part, and if you will be able to purchase all the golden parts with real money, there WILL be a huge difference between those who do not pay and those who do.I'd really ask ubi$oft to make the microtransactions available ONLY for COSMETICS, just like on all other games on interwebz (Dota 2, League of Legends, Team Fortress 2 [HATS!], and so on. I'm pretty sure you will gain a lot from those cosmetics (people won't mind if you add a 30$ cosmetic item that will have ""unusual"" effects, such as leaving some kind of light trail, etc) and players won't actually hate you because you released such a nice game but ♥♥♥♥ed it up in the end with P2W system. Edit 1: I'm not sure if there's anything else to be done after you hit the level 10 cap. Any other missions you complete will give you bucks BUT not xp. Also the parts you unlock are for level 15+, so I find it kinda useless (for now). Does anyone agree, at least in the next closed beta, to raise the level cap to 20? It takes about 2 hours to complete all the story quests and get to level 10.If you want to actually do something to earn you stuff, try find all the 20 parts of certain cars that will unlock you some really awesome vehicles, with good stats too as well.tl;dr: play game 10/10, ubi$oft plz no microtransactions on performance parts, raise level cap 20, ty.Edit 2: I made a poll about microtransactions, please vote: http://strawpoll.me/2428839 "

 do NOT purchase, even on sale!	  Pros	  Fun at times Graphics are nice Cons	  Horrible physics ""Rubberbanding"" AI (just like you'd find in a cart racer) Low amounts of customization Low amount of vehicles Virtually NO performance options available except for the ones you unlock from races. Horrible main stream music with no variety. It is NOT a simulator as it is tagged. it is NOT a MMO.(about 10 people per session does not make it an MMO) The little multiplayer they have is badly done. The story, while decent, is a massive heap of plot holes, just forget about them it makes it better. Roads are made of what seems like ice. the speed indicated seems like its way faster than the speed you seem to be going. Wants to show me random pointless cutscenes every 30 seconds. Cities are not ever close to accuratly represented to scale or appearance. Free roam would be nice, except its useless. you are forced to enter the map to start missions anyway. Micro transactions for in-game currency, are you kidding me? On a $60 game!?The physics are just wrong. tap an electrical pole and it just pops out of the ground and goes soaring through the air. seriously.The rubberbanding is absolutly horrible, I gained the lead by a huge amount and out of nowhere the other cars top speed raises by at least double letting them catch up in no time at all. Meanwhile if i hit one thing, just one, be it trash can or fence, I have offically lost the race because I cannot keep up.The only way it seems to get performance parts is to win races. So win them all with gold or you wont be able to move on.Huge story plot hole #1 --- Man puts hit on you, Go looking for guys friends to beat them in a race. Why wouldn't they just shoot you..? "

												After the FORCED 5.9gb wildrun update, game is unplayable. They locked the controls customization and they expect every player out there to play with the d,i,l,d,o controls they have assigned. .. nope, i can't do that. I've been playing for over 10 years with the layout I like to use, it's like telling Formula 1 pilot to jump into another F1 that is not setup for him ... uncomfy seat, pedals in wrong place ...etc.Just not happening, I'm no longer playing or supporting this game. Something as small as locking the controls can destroy the game. GG ubisoft ... as expected they don't have much brain nowdays. Why would you even include ""controls customization"" if you can't customize? I mean some stuff works, but some stuff is locked, the locked part is VITAL to me and it cannot be changed, very bad. Useless game, hope they go bankrupt.Also new update made grass look like out of a cartoon. Speaking of online, it's very bugged. When trying to play with friends, it keeps disconnecting and friends keep disappearing on map, you see their name, but not the car or they disappear completely and then it complains that ""can't join session"" or some other bs like that.On top of all that, at some point entire coop and PvP was unavailable and Ubisoft was blaming steam servers for this, how can it be STEAM servers, if this is a 3rd party game? It doesn't even run on steam, you can purchase and download via steam, but servers are hosted by Ubisoft. Ubisoft is very bad and untrustable company, they lie and deceive and scam.They show you one thing, but release something completely different.Also savegame is 100% server sided, If it corrupts (which it does sometimes), then only way to fix this, is to contact ubisoft support and it takes them 1-3 months to reply to tickets. I was literally stuck for 3 months, because my savegame was stuck on loading and their support took 3 months to reply (not over reacting, literally 3 months).Concept is nice, map is huge, but entire game is very badly executed and nearly no support, Ubisoft is money greedy company and all they care about is money, they don't care about gaming experience. I don't recommend this to real gamers, it might look like a cool game, but after bit of playing it gets' very irritating and frustrating to deal with bad support and all those bugs and glitches.			"

I was escaping the police pursuit. Suddenly one of police cars started to ram me (on speedhack of course) and when he touched my car we both started to fly reeeeeally high. I landed in the middle of the forest & the police car landed 2 meters near me. He blocked my way out (well, I couldn't move either because I had Street spec car), arrested me and then the lady in the police radio said '5+, very good work'. Yes! Very good work Ubisoft. Welcome to The Crew.Pros:- You know... big, open world, where you can do anything,- There are some really nice places to visit,Cons:- U(don't)Play - yes, I know it's nice to do the actions, achievements, etc. in this, but this app extends game launching from 5 seconds to 1 minute,- CREW CREDITS - yes, this game has microtransactions,- Low amount of cars,- HUGE RACING MMO with up to 8 players in one session,- The game story is so boring that I already forgot the main characters name,- Physics is so bad that I can't understand why one of the minigames is flying the car as far as possible - it shows all the bugs,- Police cars IQ is very disappointing - all they can do is ramming. Who needs keeping civilians safe when you can just hit players car to crash in 10 cars / 5 persons on the sidewalk?- I couldn't find anyone to play Fraction Missions 2 months after release. LoL- Cars after tuning are very ugly (for me doesn't mean for everyone),- Several times I couldn't accept invite to coop from other players,- I don't know what are roads in this game made of, but it doesn't look like asphalt,_________________________________________Don't buy it for 50€. Please don't do this.			"

												For the most part I can IGNORE the BAD BAD BAD AWFUL AFWUL cop chases, car customization and stuff but I bought this game for my friend HOPING that we can play together. Never ever had it crossed my mind that my friend and I CAN'T PLAY TOGETHER this so called MMO. Pure crap! And the 50 euro price tag is a cruel joke. I can't begin to say how sorry I am to have payed for this game.			"

												Beta tested Aug. 25 to Aug 29. I am going to get this out of the way first, yes this game looks and feels a lot like Need for Speed's Underground and Most Wanted series. For me that is the best possible thing, because I loved those games and I am not a fan of where that franchise is at the moment. Story - The story will immediately bring you back to the NFS stories. While it isn't the most original, it fits what the game is. the cinematics don't look bad, but the cut scenes after almost everything you do can be a little annoying. You can skip them though, which is of course a good thing.  The driving mechanics are more arcade style, but it still has a realistic feel to it for those who like that. I like to switch between over the top and in the car camera, and I will say they did a good job with the in the car detail.The controls are great, even with a keyboard and mouse if you're a fan of that mode. From what I have seen both controller and wheel work great with this game. Personally I prefer controller, but might be looking to get into a wheel if I find myself playing it a lot. The world. It took me 14 minutes to get from Chicago to New York City. That is a long time considering I was driving around 140 the entire time. The world is huge, I am a little upset that they didn't even think my homestate of Connecticut was important enough to put on the map, but hey I can forgive them. During the beta I ran into many players and was invited to their crews as well.Missions. The most fun mission that I took part in was I believe called a Raid. Myself and two other players had to chase down an NPC and take them out. We were in our street cars and the target was in a raid vehicle. Even with strangers this was fun, so I know it will be a lot of fun with friends. The regular races are fun and challenging, the maps are of a nice design, but if you are someone who doesn't like racing with traffic around, you may want to only race when it is an evening time. Yes, the population follows the time, if it is afternoon or rush hour there will be tons of traffic, if it's night time there will be almost none. I crashed a lot and I feel like I am a good driver in these types of games, trying to avoid crashing is part of the fun though of course. Other players - For the most part the other players that I ran into were pretty cool. However you always have to beware of those players who are only out to troll you. They will just ram you for no reason and stuff like that. One thing I liked about the game was that it announces who the most wanted player online is. I'm not sure how the servers work for the game, but it's a nice feature to see and maybe even strive for. Customization - Since it is still beta there wasn't much customization. There were maybe 5-10 choices for visualization except for right and left fenders, also not sure about stickers since I didn't use them. The choices that were there were nice and shows that we have some cool options coming in the future. There were no performance options yet, but you gain some from completing missions that give bonuses and increase your car level. All in all I think the game looks and feels very promising. With Need for Speed going into the more Realistic/Exotic car with no customization field, this game looks to take its place. The game to me feels like it will be a lot more fun with friends, but can still hold it's own solo or with friends you meet through the game itself. I definitely recommend this game. I hope you enjoy it and I hope to see you on the track.In its current state and with the promise of all the additions that will be available at release I will give the game a 7/10 for now. Once the game releases I am sure that will go to between 8-9 in the racing genre.I am seeing a lot of complaining about the length of the beta. You don't have to pre-purchase. You made the choice to do it, so try to keep complaining to a minimum. Second, there is a way to change the 30FPS problem, you just have to do a bit of research. I didn't do it myself but a streamer that I was watching did, and some in his chat also. Now onto the review.			"

 If you get TL;DR syndrome then skip down to ""Verdict of The Crew"" but I encourage you to read the specifics so that you can accurately judge if this game is right for you.  First Rule of The Crew:      - Do  NOT  buy this game unless you have a human companion to play it with! As many others have probably stated, hardly anybody plays this game online; the servers are ghost towns. The players that are online in this game, based on their driving style, are probably around 10-13 years of age (offense only mildly intended if you are of that age range). It is not uncommon for an online driver to see your car and immediately attempt a T-bone maneuver. Therefore, if you are seriously considering purchasing this game, make absolutely sure that you have a friend to play with online so that this game can begin to live up to the expectations we all had of it. Premise of The Crew:      - The Crew was designed to be an MMORG (Massively Multiplayer Online Racing Game), which in concept is absolutely brilliant! In execution, however, The Crew has fallen short due to empty servers and a bug-laden open world. It cannot be denied that the premise of this game is one of the best of all time, but it seems that the makers of The Crew lacked the man-power in their programming teams to make this work well. Accolades of The Crew:      - The Crew is one of the most fun games I have ever played! My friend and I would meet online regularly to do missions together, rank up our cars together, take on challenges together and our favorite - drive in the open world together. In terms of sheer enjoyment for a racing video game, The Crew has to make the Top 5! (...when it's working...)     - The Crew has a  massive  open world map! The map is probably about a 20:1 scale map of the United States; the map is by no means cartographically accurate, but the major landmarks and cities are there. Everything is down in scale (similar to Midnight Club: LA or the GTA games), but that doesn't mean that the world doesn't feel humongous! It is a daunting task to think about driving from Miami to Seattle, or LA to Niagara Falls, but as one who has done it, there are few things more exciting! There are many little easter eggs on the map to find in addition to the hidden objects and challenges that make simply driving around in the open world interesting and fun.      - The Crew has a fairly large list of cars that are available in the game and all of the cars available look great in the game. You can customize your car with different body sets, colors and stickers to make your vehicle one of a kind. The cars also handle pretty well all things considered; The Crew is definitely not a simulator when it comes to driving but for an arcade style racer the car handling is more realistic than it could have been. It should be said that by the time you beat the game and level up your first car to Level 50 parts and a 1200+ rating, however, you  will  have a favorite car or two and for the most part only drive those cars.     - The Crew has pretty decent graphics too. I have found myself taking screenshots of the scenery, much like I do with Skyrim, because the world really does look great! Of course, the world looks better at 60-80mph than it does at 180-200mph, even with the best GPUs, but that's to be expected.  Complications with The Crew:      - This game is buggy. There is no simpler way to say it. And there is no denying it. My friend and I have constantly been thwarted by programming issues within the game. During open world travels we will inevitably come across at least a major bug or two every 30-60 mins. Some of the worst, especially since the new expansion has come out, include (1) infinite loading screens, (2) game freezing during fast travel, and my personal nemesis - (3) the road/world disappearing in front of you [this bug has an relatively easy fix - just open up the map and quickly exit out again, but it is annoying nonetheless. It is also potentially game breaking when you are in a mission or co-op event when the open world map is not accessible.] There is no way to enjoy The Crew without experiencing bugs. Maybe if there were more people online the makers of The Crew would be inclined to fix them, but since there are not, you just have to deal with them. This creates a Love/Hate relationship with this game.     - The AI in this game is... wonky, to say the least. For missions/co-op events or in police chases, the AI seems counter-productive (as opposed to challenging) and even vengeful at times. Rubberbanding  definitely  occurs in these types of events and should be expected (heck, sometimes I think they designed it that way just so that you  NEED  a crew playing with you). In the open world, expect AI driven cars to suddenly swerve in front of you, especially if you are going 200+mph. If there were any corners cut in the programming of this game, I would think that they were cut in this AI department.     - If you do end up convincing a friend to buy this game with you so that you can play it together, then you should also know that forming a crew in the game can be difficult at times too. It is normal for my friend and I to spend 15-30 mins trying to get into a crew together and forcing the game to put us on the same server. Game restarts should be expected, and it should also be noted that The Crew doesn't always play nice with Steam's voice chat (probably because it's a Ubisoft game and uses UPlay. **As a side note though, I have not had as many issues with Uplay as I have had with other games they put out**). Tips for The Crew:      - Many others have said it on forums and discussion boards, but this game  NEEDS  a multiple waypoint system. The gigantic map is just begging for one! It is very frustrating to try and create driving routes and races with your crew/friend with only one waypoint to lay down. Honestly, I am very surprised by this huge oversight!     -  Along with that, this game would be vastly improved if there was a community based Player Created Races/Challenges feature. Since open world driving is the best (and most advertised) feature in the game, having a community of racers all creating their own races/routes/challenges would add content and excitement to the game. Verdict of The Crew:      - I have put over 80 hours into this game and about 70 of those hours have been genuinely enjoyable! Open world driving is by far my favorite activity and with the help of my friend I have come up with several fantastic driving routes that are always a blast to drive! There is no other game quite like The Crew and my heart wants everyone to buy and enjoy this game.      - The remaining 10 hours I have spent in this game, however, make it so that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game for the $30/$40 listing price. Even on sale, if you  don't  have a friend to play this game with, I would  highly  recommend that you stay far, far away! But if you do have a friend to play with, I would want you to seriously consider the issues presented in this review and weigh them against your desire for this game:           (1) If there is any hesitation, then spend your money elsewhere.           (2) If there is still excitement and a ""devil-may-care"" attitude, then all I can say is, ""Good luck!""			"

												It could have been such a wonderful game. The idea is solid, the map and community/social aspects are fantastic, but Ubi really screwed up some pretty major details. The car handling, as I'm sure you'll read in a thousand negative reviews, is terrible. 260 km/h feels like 100 km/h, rivals and NPC racers seem to rip around the track like they're on rails, and they have absolutely no problem pushing you out of the way while you struggle to change their course even slightly. The raid events are frustrating, as the vehicle seems to swap ends for what looks like no reason. Off road, every vehicle handles like butter on a hot skillet. It could have been good, but I think I'm going to turn my Xbone on and stay with Forza. Maybe Ubi should play Horizon 2 and take a page or three from it.			"

												I don´t really understand why there are so many people complaning...The Map is huge, not a joke like the super-tiny NFS Maps who were always too small to have a real racing/car-game feeling.The graphics is quite good given the size of the map, even though it looks somewhat generic the most time. If you want a car-themed game with a lot of space to cruise around with real cars, this game is for you.The only real downsides I found were some pretty annoying missions in the main story.Yes, there isn´t much to do after reaching LVL 50 and completing the main story, but is this the only thing important?Cant say anything about PVP, never did it.Compared to some other Ubisoft Games in 2015/2016 this game is quite okay.

Do you know who are you working for ?-yes, Ubisoft.-Right, and what's our reputation ?-Being the best at screwing up good game concept and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off our customers ?-Exactly ! Now this game has many flaws but none of them are really frustrating-Indeed, that's why we created Uplay back then-Not enough son, not enough. I want the whole team in the crisis room in 5 minutes(gathering the team and explaining the situation)-Sir, I got an idea-Sure go ahead-Well why don't we force the player to connect to a main server ?-Many games do that, not really frustrating.-True, but we would require the player to be constantly connected-ooooh, that's good, I like it-And the main server would be super instable and people would be kicked from the game at anytime, loosing their progression !-Genius, I promote you president of Ubisoft.EDIT : You guys say it's a MMO ?Do you actually know what MMO stands for ? Just the first ""M"" ?You'll interact with 8 players max. at a time...holly molly, that's massive !Ubisoft used the term MMO for marketing purpose only,  there's isn't a single solid reason to prevent us from playing this game in SP.

												This game is basically ""how to not make a good racing game 101""1. Auto catch up2. AI is over tuned to try and make up for the players ability to use cars ""over the cap""   a) cops are unstopable all seeing terminators and getting away from this is more chore than skill   b) it literally ignores the in game physics   c) uses non spec (street,dirt, perf) cars perfectly in any situation Perf car on dirt? No problem, you however won't stop being sideways3. The game at points forces you to use sub par spec cars because ""story"" which are usually just time trials with an annoying npc yelling at you4. PvP is waiting in a queue to never getting into the game5. co-op is just two people suffering through a race and most the time even if someone pulls up next to you in the same race they'll just ignore the co-op request6. Overly expensive cars with arbitrary limitations on what can and cannot be certain specs7. Raid spec activities are just awful8. car spec designs are generic and the for purchase asthetics don't fix much9. If you do manage to find someone in co-op then the lag shows up pretty bad 10. world is flat and uniteresting until cars randomly pop in and you crashIf you're on the fence about buying this game don't do it. Just wait until GTA 5 comes out on PC and play GTA Online because it's superior in every way.			"

												After around 40 hours of playing, I have completed the story, yet there is so much replayability since the map is amazing. But I will discuss what I think are the pros and cons and possible improvements of the game.Pros:- Loading Screens are replaced with cinematics and statistics/parts. Using an SSD, these load time seems very quick.- Huge World Size/Map, the large map with the amount of detail put in is incredible, each area feels representative and visually stunning. This by far is the best part of the game. You can even zoom right into the other side of the map, and see LIVE details. Even sitting on the opposite side of the world map.- AFK Cinematic, when AFK your screen goes into different camera angles around your vehicle, with the terrain and weather affecting it.- 5 Base Car specs, These being Street, Performance, Circuit, Dirt, and Raid. Each with their pros and cons. Myself I prefer Circuit and Performance. These specs determine where and how you drive. (Expansion adds Monster, Drift, Drag)- Day/Night Cycle. During the night, everything feels different, yet good. The night time scene can be as visually stunning as daytime.- Customization, the customization in parts, colours and stickers. Are very good. You can even customize your interior. This allows people to make their car look the way they like it for each spec.- Exploration, as there are so many places to go, plus the incentives like hidden car parts, and landmarks, it feels like you always have something to find. Plus you cannot FAST TRAVEL to places you haven't explored on the map.- Arcade-like, yet realistic. It is a fine line between the two, but The Crew seems to have found a nice balance. With destructible (yet respawnable) gameworld. Crashes are of course nowhere near as deadly, but damage to the car happens and is visible until repaired.- Factions, you can choose between 5 factions (eventually) each allowing you to represent them in faction races and events. Earn reputation and you can earn more in-game $$ too.- Coop/Friends - Playing with up to 4 friends is great, especially how every race/mission/skill has its own leaderboard. Competing against your friends score is a great incentive. - Price, I purchased The Crew whilst it was on Holiday Sale (50% off). so it felt very valued for the time spent. The retail cost seems fair, however. As there are at least 30 hours of missions. + Countless hours worth of skills/exploration/PVP/factions etc.- Public Transport, If you do not want to drive from New York to Discover Los Angeles (for example), you can take a train or airplane, as a sort of paid fast travel. But I recommend just driving.- Skills, along every route and dotted everywhere along the map, are skills. These are objectives to earn parts for your car and compete against your friend. Makes the trip more enjoyable when every 5-10 minutes you can do some weaving (Slalom) for some fun, and parts. (If you're good enough).- Police Chases, cause enough destruction around a surveyed area, and you get some police chasing after you. Get caught and pay a HEFTY fine. - Vehicle Stock. There are over 50 in-game purchasable cars, each able to be specced out in different ways, some being able to be specced in most areas.- Driver cam. Seeing the interior and the world as it would be, LOVE IT.Cons:- Cinematic Bugs, especially annoying since the cinematics are stunning. Having the audio completely drop out is really annoying. Even after replaying it at HQ, it still doesn't work. Having to replay the cinematic on youtube to hear it is not good. Also, a few times my car would flip over in the cinematic.- Locked to certain specs for races. I would like to compete against AI/friends using whatever car I want. But races will lock you to the SPEC. I think the route would balance what would be recommended vs what could be used.- Wild Run coaxing. Seems a bit pushy. Game starting screen, WILD RUN. Map spawn location. WILD RUN event. Certain skills (long jump etc) only achievable in drag car (WILD RUN). Want others to join you in missions (Look for crew) WILD RUN. I would like to see these features changed so that they less invasive, and more tempting rather than pushed you on. And for the price, Wild run is NOT worth it.- HQs / Tuners, most have the same background/area, some dingy commercial garage. Would like to see these being different and representative of the area.- Voice acting, it is not synced at all, and for some reason, they often call (Alex) 'kid'. Even if Alex is a middle-aged man. Pretty weird. - NO Cross Console compatibility. Cannot play with my console brethren.- PvP unbalanced. Vsing People 500pts above you. Lambo vs Mini Cooper.. Come on.- Perks should be removed completely, add the bonuses as standard when unlocking your allies.- 'Dumb' Smart Loot. Lvl 50 in a 600 pt car gets the highest score, better give him a bronze Lvl 25 part?? A lower score would have given me a better part.- Notifications on Old Parts. Seeing I have a new Lvl 25 bronze part for my platinum specced car when I visit the workshop is a bit annoying.Improvements:- Public Transport. Allowing the player to BOARD a train, or AIRPLANE, and visually see the map around them as they journey across.- Missions. Missions/Faction Races could be improved to be more rewarding. The 4hour race should have a way better reward then the 2.5hour race. A bigger REP or $$ Bonus would be nice. Also more of them. It is really simple to make them as the map is perfect. Just put a marker from A to B anywhere on the map.- Character Customization. Customization of 'Alex' would be great especially in the open multiplayer world. The Same change of clothes the whole game, does this guy even shower?- Music/Radio. More stations/music lists. It seems they are repeating quite frequently.- Test Drives. These should be like a normal test drive, drive wherever you want. Pay for damages. I do not like being limited to the small area (test lap) around the city the dealer is in. I would like to go to the track to be able to dry these cars out etc. There could be a % BOND of the Car Price that you have to pay before getting to drive it, and if you damage the car you end up paying for it later, like those A >  B missions that penalize car damage.- Car Specs. Having cars limited to 1 or 2 specs is not realistic. As most Perf cars could be Circuit cars and visa versa. Also, these should be visible to see what it would look like BEFORE purchasing.- Cross platform. Cross Console compatibility.- Removal of spec specific races. Or adding races that you can choose. Prefer the later option.- Random Vehicle Customization at DEALERS. Having it on purchased parts at the HQ is good, but being able to randomize what the car could look like at the tuner would be ideal.- Customization Lock options. Like the colour/shape (for example), should be able to lock those options.- AFK Cam, Toggleable On/Off and a smoother, slower shift in camera angles, over the Jumpy random camera angles. Also removal of the BLUR effect when in this mode.- Removal of 'Updating Content' loading. When alt-tabbing. Especially in borderless mode.- Controls. WASD STANDARD for speed etc. Who the hell uses arrow keys? Having everything on 1 side is easier. Lucky you can rebind them.- Scrapping Parts. Should be a lot more rewarding, and possible in the workshop.- Ragdoll effects on animals and people. If you hit them, you should probably see them go flying, instead of clipping through the car. A solid quick vibration would be a nice touch, for the real immersion.ConclusionAs usual, there are a lot of things that could be improved,.but I do highly recommend this game. Not only for racing, but for exploration.(If you found this review helpful, give it a thumbs up!) "

The way the pregression system is set up, people who have already compleated the missions you are working on have no reason to help because they have already unlocked the part that you earn for compleating the mission.Not to mention that those 6k people that are currently in game are devided up into 8 player lobby/sessions which means that you will almost NEVER run into another player unless you are going out of your way to do so.Currently the chat system isn't used by anyone, and so the game just feels like a giant single player game.I repeat, this game is NOT AN MMO, its a single player game that wants to be an MMO but doesn't know what its doing.The Crew also has annoying, easy to fix flows that you don't see in older games like NFS carbon.In its current state the game is unfinished and needs a lot of work.The one thing that really grinds my gears is that I bought the game for $60, and yet ubisoft wants me to spend more money on crew credits.Why is it that you pay $60 only to be met with micro-tranactions.Ubisoft, STOP IT!!!Edit: Alright, now that I've gotten some sleep, I should mention that the game is still a lot of fun, and compaired to other modern racing games that I've played this one is my favorite, it still has some things that need to be fixed, buts its fun never the less.Driving across the massive map is awesomeTook me 120 minutes to drive from one side to the otherCustemization is good compairitively speakingOnce you reach level 20+ drifting around corners is a blastI have high hopes for the game, and I hope that eventually we will be able to play with more people.in my opinion its not worth $60 at the moment, but if it goes on sale or gets a major update that might change.

												It is a decent racing game. Not worth the full price.Pros:- Big Map.- Nice story. (while it lasts)- Enjoyable cruising.- Nice Graphics.- Enjoyable enviroment.Cons:- Uplay forced (Blame Ubisoft).- Online Connection problems (Blame Ubisoft).- Quite short story.- Grinding required for the parts.Overall, worth having in library for driving fans. :)			"

												Updated at 9/1/2015, Status update Appearently I have written too much, please click HERE[puu.sh] or HERE(doc)[puu.sh] for the full review There is a summary at the end if you are too busy to see through the whole review.And just a kindly reminder, there is no R-35 in the game yet.-------9/1/2015-------Patch released at 7th+ Car fix+ Better connection- No fix on AI- Faction War still meaningless- Still no rear mirror- Little more bugsBetter than before but not enough------------------------Hate to say it, but if you are not a big fan of a free-roam racing game, don't buy it at this momentAlthough I am not recommending this game, this doesn't mean I don't like this game, as you see I have thrown more than 100 hours in itThe Crew was a good game for people to driving around the states, it still is, but with tons of flaws atm.Still, I should start on the good things first as some of you may still interested in the game.At first, It has a biggest map for a racing game I ever saw, even I have spent more then 100 hours in the game, I still have about 1/4 to 1/5 of the map is undiscovered.If you only drive to explorer the map and not doing missions, it should take you at least 12 hours, as you can drive 3-4 hours in a starting car just driving a lap of the border.The game also provide various terrain and environment, with landmarks for players to enjoy and explorer freely.In some of the story mission, it will even provide some environment effect like fireworks or plane flying over your head which is quite stunning when you see it first time.There are 5 specs for cars: Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid, CircuitFor Street, Dirt and Perf, there are parts to let you to customize the cars, like front bumper, hood, rear wing, etc.Just be aware not all the car has all 5 spec.The interior of the cars are quite detail and you are able to customize the color of it in most of the cars.There are also different activity like skill challenge or limited period mission that may keep you playing.Bad thingsFirst of all, lack of cars, there are only 40+5(wreck) cars if you are not buying the season pass, also, there are no Audi, Toyota, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Honda, Hyundai, Vovle and more.And for each brands there are only 1-2 cars.The handling are not realistic like GT series, it is acceptable but you may feel strange for the first few hours.The things that can be driving through are also uncertain, you can drive through some fences in cities, and bounce off with others.There are no technical tuning in this game, like suspension modification, angle of tires, etc.The only thing you get is upgrading the equipment directly.There is no rear mirror view when you are in interior modeThe mechanism of automatic transmission is flawed (Details in Full review)The difficulty of this game is very hard in different aspect and it is not adjustable.First, the Rival AI's car can be insanely fast, they will not slow down by environment unless crash.For some casual driver with the staring cars, it is very hard for them to catch up.And with the auto catch-up system, even if you are good at driving and lead the whole race, you make one mistake and you will be overtake then lose.You can invite other players to the mission to try to decrease the difficultyBut the problem is you will need to wait for the game to connect to a random session before you can invite players you don't knowAnd with a maximum 8 people session, there is very hard to find one who actually willing to play with youAbout the police chase, first, the police is as fast as rival AI's car in missions.They have a circle radar around them instead of a cone vision which should be able to block by buildingsThe police heli can see through the tunnelsMost ridiculously is that if you go too far from the police cars, the police car can spawn anywhere near you, and sometime in front of youThis make you need to maintain an approximate distance that their radar cannot catch you but no police car will spawnTo escape it should be always as fast as possible, I don't know why they need to make this system so counterintuitiveThere is some perk in the game which can actually increase the handling, acceleration, speed, etc. in the gameWhich mean even with a same car, a LV50 player still have a big advantage compare to a LV1 player, if the LV1 player haven’t bought any perk points using credit which can be obtain by paying real money.Car level nearly mean everything, especially when doing story missions with others.With my 1200 lv cars, I always outrun the guy who invited me to the coop mission in his/her first time attempt.In my experience, the higher lv car you have, the higher position you will get in PVP.And to get a car over 1000lv, you will first have to reach 50 lv at your characterWhich mean you will have a big disadvantage before you reach 50 lvIn this game there is a faction war system but meaninglessThe stability of the session can be very unstableWhen you are in a crew, you select a mission and invite you crewmate, you can end up with your crew member playing the mission themselves and you get a forever loading screenSimilar things happen when you select public PVP lobby, you will be the only one who get into the lobby and your crewmate will continue finding a lobby.Sometimes you crew member will not appear in your screen even when you are beside of him/her.PVP sessions also contain connection problemsSometimes when other player in your session have a unstable connection, the game will pause for 5 secondswhen the player have a really bad connection, you game can have more than 10 times pauses, which is extremely annoyingsometimes you can also getting left behind at the starting line when people already racing in front of you with about a hundred yards awayThis is a nice racing game, and for some people it is still a masterpiecebut it is also nearly the worst racing online game ever, don't even know why they make the MMO feature as a selling pointThe slogan of this game is ""Never Drive Alone"", but for me it is like ""Never Drive Alone If You Want To Suffer""SummaryProsHuge map for explorationMany customization for some cars in some specDetail and customizable interiorBeautiful and various environmentEnvironment effects in story missionsDifferent activities that keep you playingConsLack of carsNo technical tuningHandling/Physics are not realisticFlaws in automatic transmissionNo rear mirrorDifficulty is overall high and not adjustableAI cars will not slow down by environmentMaximum 8 people session make players hard to crew upPolice chasing system is stupid and annoyingPerk system can provide unbalanced advantagesLV of cars nearly mean everythingFaction War system is totally unfairForced online with the server is unstableGame statistics can be messed up by the game/serverUnstable connection among friends/crew member and to the sessionsPVP connection problemBad avatar systemVarious BugsMixedToo much uncertainty on the roadRecommend to buy it if youLove free rome style racing gameHave friends to play together and can tolerate to any possible fail from the serverLove customize your cars and show offNot Recommend to buy it if youCares more about realism of racingAre a casual driver and consider this game as a single player racing gameDon't want to use tons of times to climb the ladder (Cars LV, PVP, Faction)Want to drive cars that doesn't exist in the game (find the list on the internet)Want to race on 1:1 scale circuitHave a bad connection			"

												Where to start ? ... I gave my hope away on this game, I was expecting so much and it disapointed me.Such a great map, good graphics and simcade driving, was everything I was looking for, to play with some friends, I was hoping with the updates they would fix the majority of bugs, and add some new stuff to the game, but no.So far I think they released the beta version on the game, sometimes I even think the beta had less bugs then now, lol .. Pros :- Great map, it's really awesome;- Graphics are good;- Cockpit view, the interiors are well designed;- Simcade driving is fun;- Many specs ( Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Circuit ).Cons:- Lack of cars, only 47 fullstock cars (if I'm not wrong.);- Exterior car custimization is just poor:      - 200 rims ? And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors.       - The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.      - Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them;- The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against.- Cockpit view:      - When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.      - In cockpit view your mirrors don't work;- AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down. - Some of the game physics are just out of this world:       - You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.       - You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h;- PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly.- In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.(...)And there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to ""farm"" money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week.Because you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.Should you buy the game?Yes/No.- Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted.- No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this. To me this was the most expensive ""early-acess"" that I've ever bought.			"

												For a game advertise as an ""MMO"" for cars it's quite sad that you have only a limited number of person by instance (something around 8 person).The car choice is nice, if you like muscle car and exotic. But there is also a serious lack of diversity (2 asian car, that is really not much). We should have iconic car that was used in rally racing, audi quattro, mitsubishi evo (at least one), a subaru STI (at least one also), the first mini, toyota celica. Also we are missing nice super/hyper japanese car (no nissan GTR R35 really ?, no Lexus LFA)The car customisation is quite poor also, we have a lot of choice for the starter car but not so much for the rest of it. The driving experience is cool though driving through the whole united states with friends is quite nice.I would still recommend this game, but not at this price.  "

												While I have had an amazing time playing this game, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.  Ubisoft support is lacking on a good day, downright rude and dismissive on bad.  At the time I write this, I'm 9 days late recieving a Crew-Credit pack, while their store is still up selling them.Also world records on every skill challenge/mission is held by hackers, so there's no recognition for actually doing well.

												Remember all those people that keep saying the latest racing games are awful and they're no match to titles like Need For Speed Underground, Need For Speed Most Wanted, Juiced, Midnight Club, well...this game is trying to be that and people still♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it.Ivory Tower, the developers of the game, are listening to the suggestions the community offers and rant about, but no, Ubisoft are the publishers of this game therefore it's crap.And for the people that only care about the graphics, ♥♥♥♥ your graphics.It's really sad to see so many negative reviews for a game that is actually trying to match the quality of the early 2000s' racing games.The developers of this game are actually trying, so instead of shiting all over they're game, maybe you should give them some constructive feedback			"

												So, Ivory Tower. A good studio. Exept, they are managed by Ubisoft, and that means problems. I have the season pass for The Crew, and it did not come with Wild Run (£14.99) or the newest DLC Calling All Units (£19.99). Now, am I now entitled to take a poo on their doorstep? The season pass only comes with the DLC's that are much cheaper than these new ones. Also the previous large DLC which was Wild Run did not support all of the cars, and the reason for the game having a mostly negative review space is that the game studio is owned by Ubisoft, and Ubisoft have a known reputation for releasing DLC, sorry, WAY TOO MUCH DLC, for a game that feels incomplete without it. It feels as if the updates for this game have been payed for and added in a DLC form, now this game is actually quite a good one, exept for the overpriced nonsense.			"

												The game is very nice but the price is high but it is totally worth it if you get discounts. Very good quality graphics and a huge map.+ Giant open world+ Fully Voiced and Subtitled story (40 Hrs for me)+ Multitude of different game modes+ Good Graphics (for not much Processing Power)+ Month long ""Summit"" events from the WildRun DLC that end in free cars being given out (Ducati bike At the time of this review)+ Multiple Specs/Classes of cars (6 Vanilla; 9 Wildrun)+ Fairly Detailed Customization (Bumpers, Hoods, Rims, Paint, etc.)+ Rewards for exploration (ie. Hidden Cars)+ Nice Community+ Multiple real world race tracks of different styles and uses+ Good Controller compatability and Rebindable keys			"

												Edit (2016) They have sold a ""complete edition"" when there is more content on the way, so you can pay once for the game with the season pass, pay again for the content that doesn't come in the season pass, then pay one more time for more content not included to be released. To hell with this game. Edit (4/25/2015) : They added a few new cars and some specs, fixed some bugs and managed to improve the main menu with a slideshow and the online matchmaking with a merge-all lobby system. Perhaps it's enough of a change for you to enjoy this game? Me, I checked and played the 'new' content for a few hours and unninstalled it again, personally I can't find any improvement worth a buyback into this game since my gripe is the terrible driving mechanics alongside the bad physics. I remain true to every word I wrote in this review. I had high hopes for this game, I played the betas, followed the forums and pre-ordered it. Then I forced myself to like it and play it even after I was completely frustrated by everything I'm about to say. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE AND/OR PRICE TAG.Before the ugly : THE CREW is not a complete mess, there is the possibility of having a great amount of fun playing this game depending on what kinda of player you are. One thing it gets right is the map diversion. Every spot, every city or zone as they say, has it's own feeling and design, it's unique, and driving around the map with a friend is sure entertaining. but that's it. if you're not the person who enjoys cross country trips or american cars, there is not much for you here. Entitled as ""MMO CAR-PG"" but you can't develop your character, not a single aspect. In theory, every player has the same exact character, solution? Let's hide other player's driver. and that's it. Let's say you play against remote controlled cars, for immersion's sake. you CAN'T call it an mmo, without character development, the best you'll get are perks, nothing really groundbreaking. but we have cars, don't we?There are 30~40 cars and all of them seem unfinished, except for the first ones. because you know, ""first impressions are always the most important"". the first five cars have all the specs available, street, dirt, performance, raid and circuit. other cars usually have 2~3 specs only. so you wanna go crazy off road with that expensive car? too bad. also, most cars are American, so no luxury here. what's most stupid is the unbalanced performance cars have, the starter vehicles run faster then the most expensive car in the game. But driving gets better as your car and player level increases, right? No. That's an excuse for the handling in the game. It doesn't get better. I have 1299 ( Max level ) cars and with assistance off, they just don't grip on the road as the default low level mustang does. With assistance on, it's just ""drifting"". The crew should have stayed as a street racing game only, the street tracks are okay, the handling on street is OK. but when it goes off-road becomes soap ( and not in a good 'Dirt game' way of soap ), on circuit the game just doesn't have enough decent physics to feel solid, and while climbing mountains with raid spec... I wish you good luck trying not to roll 900º in the air after hitting that small rock. this game is unpredictable thanks to it's physics, you never know how is your car going to react to crashes so expect for the worst and try avoiding collisions. worth adding : some elements break, some doesn't, and in this game this is not okay because when someone tries to cut their way trough some houses, the fences breaks. When you're doing the turn on a corner, well, the fence it very likely to be the most solid virtual object you'll ever find. Progression is BROKEN, I had to try various missions at least three times due to disconnects that WIPED my progress, my statistics are currently like this "" main missions complete : 167% "", and the rewards are ridiculously unbalanced. Let me explain this : I leveled from 1 to 50 in ONE DAY AND A HALF doing no more than 60 PvP matches, 10 or so story missions and some exploration. Yes, I reached maxed level on an MMO in basically a day. It gets better, I was being rewarded 16k bucks every time I finished first on a PvP match, and when you are disqualified because you couldn't get to the finish line in time, well, TAKE THESE 16K BUCKS ANYWAY. You just know they didn't really put any thought into the game's progression when all it takes from level 49 to 50 is 2 races in 10 minutes. The customization feels incomplete, some categories are there with no parts to purchase for you car, get used to the ""No part available in this category"" message. the stickers are single color only and there isn't variety among those, expect to see everyone using the same 2 flame stickers or racing stripes. the real car performance parts are available with a grind of challenges after level 50 which is not very cool given the insane difficulty of some challenges, but don't worry, it doesn't matter how fast your car is...AI CHEATS, it goes off track and spawns in front of you, It rams you constantly and the Catch-up is ridiculous. there are some gifs on Polygon's review of the crew if your interested. The story is not good, you bounce trough one generic dialog to the next and I couldn't connect to any character of this game, I couldn't care less to be honest and not skipping cutscenes was a challenge at times. At the end of the main story you are rewarded with a mix of every CGI they made for the game, which felt very very lazy.And I could go on, there is the server instability problem, the always online ""DRM"", the NAT problem that causes online atrocities, the lack of mirrors promised by launch, no weather system, the ""crew joining different lobbies"" bug, the ""Hitting someone back at 20mp/h and flying like when hit by a giant on skyrim"" bug, the ""I regret the money I spent buying this game"" case and the first time I actually emailed steam support to ask about their refund policy. I'm frustrated. I just wish I could go back to those TDU2 Times. tl;dr+ Every area is unique and has it's own feeling.+ Driving with friends can be funEdit (4/25/2015) :- A 2014 Racing game Lacking mirrors, promised by launch- Server instability, constant disconnections and progress Wipes- AI CHEATS- Incomplete customization ( Specs were added )- Not a great amount of cars ( Cars were added ) - Unbalanced car performances- Terrible car handling- Physics make for an unpredictable game- Broken progression system- Broken statistics system- Unbalanced reward system- Outdated graphics ( They fixed DoF at some camera angles )- Fake car engines- No photo mode- Cliche, generic storyline- Only 7 players on Screen- Season Pass could have been part of the game - TERRIBLE Online pvp lobby system ( Now fixed )			"

												Wild Run Update: WR is out and after a few hours with it I can safely say that literally none of the concerns I have stated below has been fixed, in fact the game has gotten noticeable worse including, but not limited to:The new vehicles included in this expansion are even more expensive in the in-game money/real life bought money conversion. While a high-end car would set you back roughly 15-20 euros/dollars(!) in the original game, the new high-end cars will be over double that. You're looking at almost 40(!!) euros/dollars for a single car and that is without any upgrade which will easily be another 20 euros/dollars if you don't have 3-4 hours to grind the in-game money for it! Also they included something called ""Smart loot"" which instead of having you travel around to certain areas of the map for challenges, you can now instead just do the same challenge over and over and over again for 5 hours and eventually you'll have your fully upgraded cars. The new extreme modes, monster trucks, bikes and drifting are essentially gimmicks that will be fun for roughly an hour. The idea around The Summit is on paper a good idea but the execution of it is probably one of the worst ideas in a while. I could go into why at lenght but just know that unless you are ready to spend several hundreds (Yes, no joke) of hours in the game, it will leave you feeling unfulfilled and that you've wasted your time because The Summit requires you to compete against other players and only the best gets rewarded properly. I could go on and on and on, with how the side walks in the game are now actual edges that will make you car fly randomly or how drifting is 90% like driving in the snow in the vanilla game or how the game is so poorly optimized that the wet roads will make your computer stutter (Even on a 980 Ti!) and how the graphical update overall is a complete disappointment and the thousand other things I haven't mentioned.I'm going to have to stop writing here as I realize the more I think about it, the more I am actually going from thinking that the game was an okay game to directly hating it and regretting this purchase full stop.The Crew and The Wild Run could've been so much more but instead we got this...Original game review:I tried being positive about this game, but in the end I can't justify it from a gameplay perspective. I like exotic cars a lot which is what has kept me at this game for so long, but I doubt a lot of people have my level of ""addiction"" to exotic cars to justify it and end up disappointed in the game. Be aware that this is an arcady game, so if you're looking for a realistic simulation game, this is not it.The traffic is poorly implemented so if a player in your session has a bad connection, the traffic will swerve left and right and it will be hard to overtake.The max number of players in a FreeDrive session is capped at 8 which in 2015 is hilariously low for a game so heavily focused on multiplayer. In addition to that, you have no control over what session you end up in. And that is without going into the required always-on DRM that will eventually happen to kick you out of the game (That is a promise) that will set your progress back 5 to 45 minutes. The graphics are mediocre and everything in the world except player cars looks like something that was made in 2010. The sound is bordering on the ridiculous (Sorry UbiSoft, but a Koeniggsegg does not sound like a BMW with a custom exhaust) and the forced disconnect if you are AFK for 10 minutes (You are returned to the start Splash screen, not even disconnected where you parked your car before going AFK) gives this game a overall poor immersion.The price decrease came too late and the game population has sort of fizzled out - That being said, it was briefly revived by the announcement of the upcoming expansion pack and the 2 hour trial. A trial that was poorly implemented. When you play the trial you meet people which makes this game a lot better, but by the end of the trial people are straight up disconnected with no chance of saying anything to the other drivers the person was driving with - The only way around this is to add them to your UbiSoft friendlist - But good luck remembering the names of the players!The game gets grindy real fast. The laughable short story does not reward you in any way towards a full upgraded car, nor does it provide you enough cash to have an acceptable level of cars with upgrades. The game essentially forces you into buying in-game cash for real money to a gross extent. 20 euros will roughly be the equivalent of 5 hours of gaming. Speaking of Euros, having encountered a bunch of Americans in the game they have proudly told me that they pay in dollars instead. In UbiSoft's world 20 euros = 20 dollars.If you ignore all of the above and you spend the 30 euros/$30 just to cruise around and complete the main story the game is fine. However, if you know cars you will cringe. If you're a completionist you will burn out fast as the game has Tetris levels of variety in gameplay.With all that being said, will I continue to play it just for cruising around in the single car I spend 15 hours to upgrade fully? Yes, I probably will.			"

												The Crew is a multiplayer always-online arcade-racer set in a huge open world which is a condensed version of the United States. It was designed by many of the same people who created Test Drive Unlimited, so it can effectively be thought of as TDU 3. It contains many of the same features, but not all (no houses or shops).


YouTube™ Video: The Crew - Missions 2 - Early Detroit Missions 

			Views: 1,216		

			In this video I redo the early missions in Detroit, which I didn't record first time around. This video showcases the different types of story missions quite well, and ends with the most fun type of...		

I think many people are unfairly critical of this game, and are failing to appreciate the best feature, the huge open world. In reality, the world area is only around 5000 sq km (about a quarter of the size of Wales), yet that's still a huge size for a game world, possibly the second largest open world racing game (Fuel is over twice as big). Road wise, there's 10,000 km of roads, 10 times as much as in the first TDU game, so that will take a long time to explore properly. But it's not just the size of the world that's impressive, it's the attention to detail and the huge number of landmarks. It's extremely well designed.The USA is not only condensed, but distorted, some areas are much larger than others. This is necessary since if everything was to scale, every city would be a tiny village. Instead, the biggest cities are made much larger, as well as features like the Grand Canyon, while less interesting areas are shrunk in size. The result is greatly distorted, but it feels really good to drive around, and I believe it does a good job of representing the ""highlights"" of the USA in a way which suits a computer game very well.

Many people have complained about the horrible car physics. I was a bit shocked at this too in the beginning, but it turns out that the early cars handle badly by design, and get much better as you upgrade them with parts. The few cars I've tried from the DLCs handle much better. It also takes a little while to tweak your wheel or controller settings to get it to feel good, but it's worth the effort.


YouTube™ Video: The Crew - Missions 1 - Detroit to St Louis 

			Views: 248		

			Continuing with the story leads me from Detroit to St Louis. I decide to get there faster by driving a McLaren F1, which has significantly better handling than the Ford Mustang.		

Apparently rubber banding is also a problem in the game, although I did read someone say it's been fixed. I've noticed it a few times with police chases, but it doesn't seem to be much of a problem to me. Speaking of police chases, I find them to be a lot of fun, while others seem to hate them. Similarly, the raid challenges can be quite frustrating, but are also fun to me. Depends on your point of view I suppose.The GPS tends to provide the shortest route between two points, which is often not the best way to get to where you want quickly (taking you through backstreets instead of sticking to main roads), but hey, SatNav does that in real life too! Just think of it as a guide that you don't have to stick to. Learning the main roads and using your ""local knowledge"" instead can save time! Also it tends to suggest offroad shortcuts, which can be annoying if you want to stick to roads, but on the other hand, it gives you a route through difficult scenery which you might otherwise get stuck in.One annoying thing I have noticed is graphical glitches during the cut scene intros to most missions. Don't know what's causing this, but it's only a minor irritation, it doesn't happen when I'm driving.Another slight peeve is that much of the terrain is too destructible, you can drive straight through lamp posts and other features as if they weren't even there, yet some are rock solid. It's sometimes hard to know which is which. Okay, so it's just an arcade game so you could say it's excusable, but it does lead to bad driving habits, driving through obstacles that you'd normally avoid. In fact, to win certain missions it's often a good idea to crash through things.https://youtu.be/blIdOUmGMh8Same goes for crashing into other cars, often (not always) this has little or no effect, barely slowing you down in most instances. Again, I don't like this because it encourages bad driving habits, not caring about hitting other cars when normally you should try to avoid them at all costs. But again, it's an arcade game, so I can live with it.Sure, there are a few faults with this game, but most of them hardly matter to me. The game world is so large, with so many places to go, so many things to see (there's educational info on historical landmarks) and so many cars to drive (not a huge selection, but there are many variants of each, and who needs hundreds of cars anyway?) that I'm having too much fun cruising and exploring to take much notice of the faults. I think if people focused less on the faults and concentrated more on the fun aspects of the game, they'd enjoy it a lot more.For me the FreeDrive mode is the real game, going on road trips solo or with friends. I dont' really care about the missions and the story that much (although they do add a nice bit of character to the game), I just want to explore America!Having said that, the game gets more interesting the deeper you get into it. As you level up you unlock factions and faction missions, and that adds a lot more fun to the game, not to mention money! Some say that money is hard to come by and there's a lot of grinding, but they're wrong, money is easy to make. It's not a ""pay to win"" game, you can pay if you're lazy, but you can make it easily enough by simply playing the game.I'm really enjoying The Crew and I highly recommend it to positive gamers who enjoy exploring a huge open world, who don't mind the arcadey gameplay and can live with a few faults. Be sure to get the Gold Edition or buy the Season Pass to get a bunch of good cars that unlock fairly early in the game, to give you a decent variety of cars to go free roaming in, otherwise you'll be stuck with the early cars for a while.Negative focused nit-pickers need not apply!

Not worth it with normal price.PROS+ Storyline are ok.+ Massive open world.+ A lot challenges (Skills) on the road.+ Graphics improvement after the Wild Run patch.CONS- Lack of customzations.- DUMB.

												If you're looking for a good racing game, this isn't really it. The physics are wonky, the AI is notorious for rubber-banding (which is really noticable in the 1 hour+ ""raid"" races), and online everybody is out for blood. That said, I still recommend this game for one real reason: It's spectacularly fun to just drive around. The map is absolutely massive -- it takes about 45 minutes to drive coast-to-coast, and the best part about it is that it's not locked to where you are in the story. After the first few hours, you get a fairly hefty sum of premium currency -- not enough to buy endgame content like a hypercar, but you can do quite a bit with it, including going well out of your way to buy a car you really want.If what you want in a car game is the ability to just drive around on a massive, diverse map, I can't think of any game better than The Crew to do it in.

												I wanted to love it, and I thought I did.  Little did I know, I was in denial.  In the trailer, they made it seem like you could roam around and see hundreds of people driving different cars.  This wasn't the case, because1) There are like 12 cars in the game, so no one has anything different.  If you're used to Forza 4 or Horizon, don't buy this.2) There aren't any massive servers.  There are only 8 cars roaming around including yourself.Overall, I'd give this game a 6/10.  It's really fun for the first two days; I'll give it that.  Once you finish those two days of cruising, it gets boring.  It gets to be a pain to play.  It becomes a grind to get what you want, which wouldn't benefit you in the long run anyway because unlike Forza, where certain cars have more potential, you can take a 370z and make it faster than a Pagani Huayra, both in handling and speed.And the AIs.  Oh my god... The AIs.  They're not part of the physics engine.  If your car is one point behind the ""recommended level"" they leave you in the dust.  If your car is one point within range of being too low, you leave them in the dust.  It's not even about skill.This is my first time leaving a review, so I'm not sure if you guys can message me or not. If you can, feel free to ask a question about the game.  Message me.Once again, 6/10.			"

IntroductionThe Crew is an open-world MMO racing game where you can play either as a street racer or a law enforcer (DLC) made by Ivory Tower in collaboration with Ubisoft Reflections. The gameplay, in general, is like one of those classic old-school Need For Speed i.e. Need For Speed Carbon, Need For Speed Underground, etc. You can drive around in a scaled-down map of the U.S. freely and visit mission activation points to race. Although The Crew is a MMO game, the game does have a single player element in it, meant to be played concurrently with the online play or used as an introduction of the gameplay. The online gameplay works similarly with Need For Speed (2016) and Grand Theft Auto V - you will be put in a session with several other players and you can interact with them in races/free-run. You will also occasionally receive racing invitations from other players.Pros and ConsPros1. Lots of car variation. Again, similar to old NFS games, you have tons of choices of cars. You also can switch cars you own on-the-street using a 'mobile garage'.2. Strong MMO aspect. Grinding for money, parts, experience, skill points, crew skills, etc makes the game worth a lot of hours.3. Customizable driving elements - sensitivity, handling control, etc.4. The Crew is going for the niche of arcade racing, so don't expect realistic driving experience like in Project Cars or Asetto Corsa. However, this connects to point (1) in the Cons list.5. Beautifully made map - not necessarily in the context of quality, the map itself feels much more alive than other racing games and I really do enjoy driving around for no reason at all. The variation of the terrain is generally accurate of the real geographical aspects of the U.S. and is definitely a plus for the gameplay.6. Massive map. Devs actually created the entire scaled-down map of the U.S. It can take quite a while to get from point A to point B. IMO, this is gold for an open-world racing game.7. Environment is alive. Unlike the dead city in NFS series, you actually have pedestrians, commercial airplanes, planes watering a farm, etc. You can use train stations and airports, too. This is one of the reasons I enjoy driving around in the game.8. Complete day-and-night cycle 9. Challenging races - your car's power in general can't be too far ahead of your opponents.10. Big variation in the gameplay: classical circuit & sprint street racing, off-roads, stunt tracks, police chase (DLC), time limits, impromptu open world events, etc.11. Detailed, color-customizable car interior12. First-person POV availableCons1. I somehow feel like I'm driving a toy car in this game, especially when I drift. It's just weird and off in general. I fiddled with the settings quite a bit and managed to make it a bit more realistic, but it's still...too virtual? This is a highly popular complaint by other reviewers and I have to say I agree with them. The physics of the game is just ridiculous - both in driving and in the environment. I know the niche is arcade racing but they should at least keep a good balance between easy and realistic instead of going full-on 'toy car mode'.2. Graphical quality is not that great and inconsistent. In some areas, you can notice that the environment texture is very crude but some other places do make quite a scenery. This gives me the 'immersion ruined' feeling since I'm very meticulous on graphical details. (Played on 4K Ultra settings)3. The voice actors are seriously bad and cringy from the start, but the voice actors in Calling All Units DLC are much worse. I can't help thinking that they made an arbitrary decision to use one of their own staff as an emergency substitute for the original voice actors who are not available for the DLC making.4. Cliche, boring storyline.5. They clearly didn't put much effort in texturing the background characters, both cars and people.6. Performance should be more optimized. Games with this level of graphical details shouldn't ask for that level of specs. This issue is extremely similar with Ubisoft's optimization issue with Watch Dogs 2 - crude graphics, but highly performance demanding.7. This one is purely subjective, but I find the radio songs to be very, very annoying. I am aware most in-game radio tracks are from new artists looking to promote their songs, like in GTA V and Watch Dogs 2, I can still accept the quality of the tracks. But in The Crew, I lost all of my tolerance to bad music. I finally made my own Classical musics and Lorde - Royal playlist, which doesn't go well with racing games but apparently, I have no choice.8. Cutscene camera was clearly designed to be bombastic, dramatic, and fast-cuts-style - this makes me nauseous.9. I'm not a fan of 'powers' (EMP, UI disabled, etc)- makes the game too arcade-y in an extreme way and definitely a killer of immersion. If I want powers, I would play Mario Kart. I do not expect these kind of things from The Crew or NFS Hot Pursuit.NeutralProgress is a bit slow. Racing rewards are a bit too low for me and the mission points are too far apart. Some people prefer this method to keep them engaged in the game for an extended period of time. But as someone who don't have that much time to play games, this style doesn't fit me. This is a very personalized point, so you decide the value based on your own life schedule.ConclusionIs it worth the price? Yes Is the CAU DLC worth paying for? Yes. The base game itself offers a lot of hours of playtime with its massive content. If you enjoy arcade racing, The Crew is your ultimate-updated-graphics arcade racing game. If you enjoy old NFS play styles combined with a big variation of cars, The Crew can also be a great fit for you. As a comparison with one of its competitor, Need For Speed (2016), The Crew lacks the physics realism, storyline, and general cutscene quality, but it offers more cars and gameplay variance. I would also recommend this game for people who love driving around, exploring various geographical landscapes.The CAU DLC's police chase content itself is already worth it. It's a great newly-added gameplay variance where you get to be the law enforcer and chase actual players. The police cars are also very cool to have and worth grinding for.Sidenote: For people who are complaining about the DLC not being unlocked after purchasing it through Steam, simply play other missions for a while, restart the game, and it will fix itselfI hope my review can help you decide whether to purchase this game!Thank you for reading.

												""The Crew"" is supposed to be advertised as this revolutionary ""Always-Online"" MMO car racing game that many people have been sitting around for years to be made. It delivers an exciting experience when read on paper, however when actually excuted makes for a sloppily made game which show obvious signs of outdated programming, and included with it an even archaic attempt to jump into the racing genre a few years too late. The ideas presented for this game are fantastic, an always online MMO where people can join crews and race against each other representing their gang, crew or team. (Basically whatever you want to call it.)The main problem lies in the focus that the game progression system, driving mechanics, progression system and general programming are flawed in so many ways it makes me wonder what year they drafted this game in before they took it to the crafting table. Design wise, the game's success is at the core of it's pitch. The ""Always online racing MMO car game that thrives while you are offline"" with a ""Progression system of great detail and complete customization"". The game focuses hard on trying to give users a feeling that the world moves on without them, and you can visibly see this in (what should be) other players actively driving around the map going objective to mission points while in active traffic along side you. Theme wise, it catches the feel of Detroit decent well, but sadly seems more or less like a rip-off towards other racing games themes that tend to stick with the south-central LA area and Detroit (Generic East Coast Theme.) There's no variation in location until the later portion of the game, and for the most part you will only see major shift changes in the locale when you move away from Detroit when you move across central USA, the dirty south, the pacific northwest, and the southwest. The map's design is heavily (and for the most part completely) based on the idea of the whole USA as a driveable entity. It's lacking point however is that there's little to no detail outside the area of Detroit, and similarly detailed areas tend to stay grouped up within each other leaving huge spans of empty road between the different regions. (Example : Central US, Between Detroit and Florida).Progression wise, the game tries to give users a sense of calm as progression unlocks aren't solely limited to ""street races"". Other goals lead to stunt jumps, checkpoint races and time attack objectives. These types of objectives spark the inner racer within all of us who prefer to beat personal times, which is great for some users. However, because progression is done with small objectives in mind to ""Level"" up your car to qualify for specific races, you'll spend more time driving frustratingly difficult time attack, check point, and stunt jump objectives due to the lack of responsive and ""actually useable"" car handling. Car handling is heavily tied to progression as the cars at early levels drive akin to that of an ice cube sliding on the ground. The cars when driven at their base level tend to be very unresponsive at the least, and you're more then likely to spin out regardless of whether or not you slow down at a corner properly or use the emergency breaks. Early game progression unlocks help ease this problem, however like I said before, you will spend a huge amount of time on small unlocks to truly level up your car to it's max potential. The pitch for this is that higher level cars are more responsive, and thus drive better. Mechanically speaking, the game runs well for what we've seen of it's previously noted issues. (Previously in beta, the animations were directly tied to the frames of the game data). Now that full 60fps support is ""Unlocked"" in the options, the lack of speed that users claimed to have in the beta is completely gone. You now have a complete sense of speed when you throttle your car above 100mph. *(160kh/m for you other homies out there.)* However, optimization in this game and it's calculation of physics and other players tend to take the game's performance below the 60fps region when in heavy traffic, but never drops below 30fps. *Hint hint* None the less, setting the graphics down in this game will tend to ease the wrath of traffic, of the obvious drawback of image quality. In addition, there are still flaws with the animation which obviously give away the fact the game was from the start developed with 30fps in mind. (Which isn't entirely a big problem, however when you play games like this which rely on user input, the resonsiveness and feeling the user gets while playing is the biggest selling point in how the game performs on a face level.) **Plot** I'm not going to say much, so far from what I've experienced the story seems akin to most standard street race movies. You are the brother to the leader of an infamous street racing gang called the 510. One day he needs you to follow him to a meet up, brother is shot and you get framed as the murderer. Fast forward five years, in an effort to clear your name and find your brothers killer, and the crooked cop who framed you for the murder, you proceed to work for the FBI to rise the ranks and bring justice back to the streets.Simply put, not exactly the best writing, character development for the lead character is non-existent and the progression of the prologue goes by so fast I honestly thought there was another beginning section I had skipped beforehand. Multiplayer wise, you're more likely to have more fun playing with the CPU then you do with actual players. Missions introduced throughout the game have two options for execution. You have the ability for solo gameplay which allows you to compete against computer opponents and progress through the game. (The only real MMO online element begins here.) For actual multiplayer, lobbies are formed via missions when you select the option to ""race online"" for that specific mission. Users are then paged, and/or formed based on who are currently doing the mission and are gathered from that method. Users past that area, or users who have not progressed to that specific portion of the game typically do not respond or bother to play online due to the lack of users because of inconsistency with progression. Half the time you will spend it again, with the CPU racing offline. With a majority of your online experiences happening at the higher levels where non-mandatory race missions are more freqent and people will be fully utilizing the ""Crew"" feature more.Overall, the game is a fun chuckle. It has it's flaws, and could be a great game with fixes. Due to it's limited playability however, and it's very difficult progression system combined with a linearly designed multiplayer it falls short on the expectations created for it at it's announcement. Did Ubisoft deliver what they promised? Partly.The game however is far from complete. For this, I have to give it a thumbs down. A game in general should be well fleshed out especially past it's multiple alpha, and beta stages which had the ability for vast numbers of user input. At this point in time it should be moderately well developed enough to not show this many flaws. I've already spent my money, and I'll continue to play it to see how development progresses. At this current point and stage from it's inital release from CORE features that were already planned for the game and is executed in it's fullest, there's no telling what can happen.tl;dr it's a rushed poor mans version of need for speed before EA became return of the sith			"

												Pay full price for a game, and they still want you to pay for the best cars.  I will never recommend a cash grab of that nature.   Yes, you can purchase some of the cars with in-game money.  But of course the best (most fun) cars require cash-only purchases.  I actually enjoy the game and will continue to play it.  But I will NEVER recommend it to my friends.			"

												This game should have not have been $60. With all the DLC, it is such a shameless money grab. Just to buy certian motorcycles, you need to own TWO DLCs! TWO! Each being $25. And it's not like you unlock them once you get both DLCs... YOU HAVE TO GRIND THE MONEY UP FOR THEM! Seriously, this game has gotten sad. I was excited to get the new cars in the game, but for some reason, you need the 'Calling All Units' DLC to buy these, EVEN IF THE CARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DLC! Just shameful...			"

												Summary: Good game 8/10 I'd recommend waiting for a small sale at least before purchasing.Pros:+ Giant open world+ Fully Voiced and Subtitled story (40 Hrs for me)+ Multitude of different game modes+ Good Graphics (for not much Processing Power)+ Month long ""Summit"" events from the WildRun DLC that end in free cars being given out (Mazda MX-5 Miata At the time of this review)+ Multiple Specs/Classes of cars (6 Vanilla; 9 Wildrun)+ Fairly Detailed Customization (Bumpers, Hoods, Rims, Paint, etc.)+ Rewards for exploration (ie. Hidden Cars)+ Nice Community+ Multiple real world race tracks of different styles and uses+ Good Controller compatability and Rebindable keysCons:- Most of the map is vacant forest area which is hard to cross at any speed- Off the Specs/Classes of cars that you are given a few of them you can't change anything on your car except paint, rims, and interior colors- Some of the game modes can get very repetative and the game might start to feel like a grind at times- The Story is a little short in my opinion for the size of the game especially the map- PvP can be very difficult for players who don't have higher leveled cars/bikes- The Physics is not very good (ie. if you see a rock, Avoid it. You will be sent flying or crash no matter what car you're driving.)- Bikes are very difficult to control with just a keyboard- The AI in this game is not very smart and can be very stupid at times (for example the longer the police chase you the easier they are to lose no matter the wanted level; or if there is a very obvious shortcut the AI will just go the normal way; or even if you get close to a pedestrian they wil jump away even if you aren't moving, they also repeat the same dialog options)- Microtransactions (Need I say more?)- Only the lower 48 US states (No Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, or Mexico)- Some major cities have been completely forgoten about (ie. San Diego, Phoenix, Portland, etc.)- No Realism in terms of Physics - Lots of Complaints of unreliability and glitchesConclusion:Would I recommed this game? Yes. Why? Because it is a unique game with some querks and drawbacks but overall if you are at all into racing games I would recommend picking it up especially if it's on sale.Verdict:8/10			"

												I don't fully understand why there are so many bad reviews both on Steam and on the web... There are a lot of great things about this game and it really is next-gen with both it's graphics and absolutely fantastic open-world. Instead of writing a long and strenuous paragraph however; I will simply provide the pro's and con's of this game.Pro's:-Insane Open World (largest I have ever experienced in video game)-Beautiful Graphics (despite what others have said, when you crank this thing to ultra it sure is a beauty)-Good Handling/Physics (change the in-game handling in the settings to ""sport"" or ""hardcore"")-Beautiful Cars (they look basically the same as they do realistically)-Selection of Music (different radio stations that you can choose in-game while driving are really cool)-An Alive World (you'll see trains, planes, cars, pedestrians, trucks, law enforcement, et cetera anywhere you go)-Difficulty (it isn't a little kids game you can easily beat; it does take some skill)-Attention to Detail (there are abandoned houses in deserts that each look totally different, cops have different accents according to the state their in, landmarks can be found throughout the map and provide you with real-life facts about those destinations, et cetera)-Decent Story (it has a story and that's what counts in my opinion, it isn't amazing but it doesn't suck either)-Car Spec's (they are very cool and unlike what most people say; you do feel a difference between them)-Only Next-Gen Racing Game Available on PC (as of my knowledge, there are no other racing games on the PC that were released at the same time as the Crew. All of the Crew's competition like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub are only limited to the consoles at the moment)Con's-Some Buggy A.I. (especially in cop chases!)-Not A Huge Selection of Cars (I don't fully know how to explain it, but I feel there should just be a more varied selection of cars)-No Profanity Settings (I know I'm getting a little ridiculous here but it would be nice to have an option to bleep out the swears)-Not the Customization I was Expecting (it's not horrible but there just aren't that many customization options)-Pathetic Community (I have tried many times to do a proper co-op race with random players and it always fails because no one will join. I have also been bombarded by trolls that are hacking in high spec'd cars that do not meet there driver level at all)-Always Online (this hasn't affected me a ton but it's a bit irritating and can get a little laggy with a lot of players)-Crashes (due to the always online part; I have crashed a few times. Fortunately the game always saves my progress so it hasn't affected me yet)-DLC (although it won't really matter whether you get it or not in the campaign, I could see there being Pay2Win's in PvP. Like seriously Ubisoft, don't make people spend $60 on a brand new game just to be greeted by the stupid $25 DLC Season Pass)Summary:Should you buy this game? Well, if you love racing games and you love exploration and you have a beasty rig (that meets the recommended settings or even the minimum settings) then buy this game, It is fantastic. If you don't have what I mentioned but are still contemplating purchasing the game, it might be best to wait until the price goes down; $60 is expensive.Anyway, if you read this entire review and found it to be helpful; then thank you for your support! Hopefully it did help you to make a decision. ^.^			"

												Most of the complaints about this game are entirely valid, and yet I'm still totally satisfied to sit down behind my G27 and just drive until my wrists are sore and my finger tips develop calluses.I don't care about the broken multiplayer, lack of a real physics model, lack of story depth, shallow tuning, short list of cars, dumb in-game GPS navigation, cheaters on the leaderboards, rubber banding AI, terrible marketing, etc, etc.The handling model is sufficient, the cars sound decent, there's a cockpit view & hood view, G27 support is alright, frame rate is super consistent (60 FPS on an overclocked GTX 760 with mostly High options, FXAA & no shadows), and the game has been completely stable for me.If you simply like to drive, then you should buy.

												The game is fun, The racing is just arcadey enough to be fun and just as real to be a challenge in close matchups.The multiplayer aspect is cool but currently not an ""MMO"". Community manager Natchai_Ubisoft on the forums said ""you'll currently have a maximum of 8 per session "" and to me that's bull. I paid for an MMO racing game not forza horizon with a bigger map and less people. So if you're looking to get this for the social side and expect to constantly be talking to people or bumping into others who want to tear down the highway it's kind of a bust. I am indecisive but my end decision is going to be not recommended because of the lack of MM in an MMO game			"

												Nice job screwing over people that already bought this game. People that want all the content but haven't bought the game yet can pay a measly 50 USD for everything, but you're going to charge people that already bought the game an extra 45 USD for the expansions. What was even the point of the season pass? I get a bunch of cars. Yeah, whatever. Why weren't the expansions a part of that? Great business practice, Ubisoft. Thanks for reminding people that it's possible to be worse than EA, even though you might not get an award for it.			"

												It's a Ubi game, so you kind of expect half truths and a dumbing down of everything they spewed that would be in the game. Ubi is also extremely good at the DLC season pass scam on all their games. Content that was promised at the start always turns up in the second year after seasons pass is gone.As for the game, I played back at launch and when I went back in recently I found they have really slowed progression in the game to the point it is just a grinder now.Big company that has mastered the scam of DLC.

												I'm so disappointed with this game, there's a lot of good, but there's a lot of bad as well.The Crew is a game made by Ivory Tower and published by Ubisoft. The Crew is an MMO where you explore the US with your crew which consists of you and your friends.Story wise the game follows on Alex Taylor. You are a rookie racer and your brother is the founder of a nation wide racing group called the 5-10. You want to join, but before you can prove yourself, your brother is murdered by another 5-10 named Shiv who teamed up with a corrupt FBI agent. A few years pass and an agent by the name of Zoe comes by with a deal, help her put both of them behind bars and you become free. But you need to work up the 5-10 chain before you can get to Shiv, so you need to build a crew from all over the country.The Crew offers a one time campaign which you can play solo or with friends. A lot of the events are identical in every region. Get to a state, find the next member of your crew, do jobs for them and repeat in an other country to work your way to Shiv. Some of the missions, include time trials, races, chases, take down missions and destroy missions where you have to destroy shipments of stuff.The graphics and the entire map are incredibly well designed. I've spent 5 hours alone on driving around and seeing the sights and trust me it's incredibly fun and at the time of me writing this review I still haven't explored the entire map, so there's a lot more to explore.The gameplay itself, is pretty decent. The game offers you different type of cars, like circuit, raid, dirt, street and perf cars which you can use to drive on different types of terrain.  A lot of them handle differently, like the circuit vehicles are incredibly fast, but brake terribly, raid vehicles can drive through all the terrain, so you can use them to drive up on mountain areas.The game also has online races, but you can forget doing Crew events cause literally no one is playing the crew races, every event is solo only and the matchmaking is some of the worst stuff, I have ever seen. If someone in the lobby has terrible internet, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will be stuck on the message that say's trying to reconnect the player having problems. The game doesn't kick him out and trust me sometimes it gets annoying when in a single race the game pauses the race multiple times trying to reconnect other players. The game also suffers from really big issues, like AI rubber banding players in the top position. and the AI in the lower positions give up on the races trying to ram each other of the road when they get the chance to do so. The game also suffers from clipping issues where you ram something so hard your car will get stuck in whatever you hit.The game overall is a really fun game, but a lot of major issues make this game not worth the full price. On a discount I can safely say you can get the game and you will not be disappointed, by the game. Final Rating:6/10 - Only buy on a discountIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

												As a racing fan since for over a decade, The Crew is the best racing game I've played, and that's saying a lot. I've played every Need For Speed and Gran Turismo. And The Crew trully shows what an open world racing game is supposed to be.It has a good open world environment to it. The USA map is perfect. Deserts, snowy mountains, swamp, forests, dry hills, plains, farms, cities, towns, villages, interesting land marks. Good variety of cars with good customization. If you're looking for TDU2 or Need for speed most wanted (2005) type games, the Crew is what you're looking for.			"

												I will separate this into two categories: Single Player and Multiplayer. Seeing as both have different stories to tell, I feel it would be appropriate to split them up. Warning, there may be spoilers, but nothing that will ruin the whole story. Enjoy.Single player:The single player has a great story, as do most games made by Ubisoft. You start the story as Alex Taylor, a man and brother who gets put into prison and framed for his brothers' death, which was caused by the main antagonist, Shiv. Throughout the story, you compete and earn your rank through a sort of street gang lead by various characters by their status, (V2, V4, V6) ultimately trying to get to the top, V8, where Shiv stands. Each city you unlock, which I might add are major cities throughout the United States, (LA, New York, Miami, etc.) you gain new members to your crew, or basically guidance and emotional support to your driving and discovery of locations, races and more. Your crew becomes a valuable asset to you, both becoming good friends and especially people you can count on. Now, for the actual review part:The single player had some good moments, great scenes, and overall a great racing experience. The handling of vehicles is the best I've seen throughout all my years of racing games, and takes the cake for that. The only thing I really wish they would have done was spend more time on the ending. It seemed very rushed and very anti-climactic. This though does not change my overall feel of the game, I still love it. Multiplayer:Multiplayer can be a separate story on its own simply in the fact you can basically go anywhere, with anyone. Traveling far distances with friends or strangers can be quite a great experience, especially if you can tolerate driving for literally hours at a time in real time. To put into perspective, you can probably make it across the whole map (let's say LA to Maine) in about an hour, or close to. This is driving at full speed, at least at 330km/h (at least I was). There's plenty of places to visit, plenty of great atmospheric areas to go to. It can be very biased, but if you're not into driving for hours at a time, I wouldn't bother playing multiplayer, I'd just stick to the story. All in all, it's a great game for what it's worth, can include hundreds of hours of multiplayer time if you're into it, or if not, you can free roam around at your will (and even go offroading in a dirt spec or raid vehicle!).

												This Review is heavily outdated but I'll give you the summary of how the game is now.-Traffic exists and is always annoying in free-roam. [Shout out to the downhill drifters in the mountain state smashing into buses on every corner]-The servers are trash and sessions barely work most of the time.-New Car releases being only buyable via microtransaction currency is garbage for a game that's dying, which means Ivory Tower and Ubisoft are trying to get as much as possible from this game's whales.-Physics are awful-Customization is still awful and isn't being expanded on other then condensing categories of existing elements.-Monster trucks were a mistake.[Wasted Development Time]-Who the hell wanted bikes?[Wasted Development Time]-Shader revamp still isn't good enough, the car headlights are dying flashlights that barely light up anything.-Race track lamps don't cast light (what the actual ♥♥♥♥ Ivory Tower?) So it's dark as hell with your awful car lights.-Most previous issues about the game still exist like barely anything to do other then drifting (Which you have to buy the wild run for)(Wild Run DLC is literally ""Buy this if you want to drift and have actual fun"")-Drifting isn't as good as it could be (Because you can't edit anything about the handling of the car apart from RNG Parts WHICH THEY MADE EVEN HARDER TO GET.)-Rx7 was put in for ridiculously high prices to force more Microtransactions.gg Ubisoft edgelords being incompetent still.Ivory Tower you can do better then this♥♥♥♥♥♥ c'mon._____[OLD REVIEW BEFORE WILDRUN]Summary at the Bottom.The Crew is a game I was quite excited for since I played the Beta, though it is suffering from some massive issues and probably more as I play more. My review style is usually pointing out the negatives, as negatives are easier to see then positives, which positives clog the list up if you try to find them and it becomes a mess.Note: I didn't pay fully for the game with my own money(I sold TF2♥♥♥♥♥♥on the market), so I am not biased by how much money I invested.Lets get started..•AI-The AI is the type to mimic what the player does if it's not in 1st place, you'll notice this if you're already playing.-And they just do things that are outright impossible. In the video Jim Sterling made at the 8 minute mark, there's a AI controlled car that just does what he is doing except at a ridiculous level and still is faster. This is a massive problem when you're racing AI and they pull this.-Source of the ridiculously bad AI; http://youtu.be/MJbAt5QWDhU?t=8m21s He's not even racing him cause it's the prologue and he's doing this cause that's how they're coded, and in races they do the exact crap.-There are also times where they go through civilian traffic vehicles to keep up with you, it's extremely unfair and frustrating.-Faction missions where you have to race these very AI for an hour or 2 is just the most infuriating thing imaginable, imagine that AI, doing insane stuff and keeping up with you while you're trying your best to not slam into traffic in crowded cities at 150-200mph and the AI is going through it like it doesn't even exist with no consequences in handling. Not fun at all and I'd say avoid ones that have you racing the AI in those long missions.•Customization-Kits are another issue, many kits aren't done yet which should of been if the game had to be delayed.-Kits like the raid or circuit, you can't customize the body for the few cars that currently have it.-You can't color your rims(Which would be so easy to put in), so you're stuck with Grey/Default, black, white, and sometimes gold)-There isn't too many selections, for instance in Dirt, if I wanted a certain headlight setup, with fog lights, I couldn't do it, I had to have fog lights with a different setup of headlights. A tad restrictive and could possibly be easily fixed seeing as the fog lights are ontop of the model.-Vinyl's are somewhat dull as well as restrictive seeing as what you see is what you get, no color changing what so ever, so you'd have to tailor your core vehicle color to the vinyl or just either have no vinyl or pick a different one.•Cars-Pretty much a 14 year olds wet dream, there's a bunch of Exotics and Muscle Cars with barely any Japanese Cars.-When you start, you have the choice between 3 identical looking American boats, or the one Japanese Car, barely much variety to start with.-There's some Civilian cars that look pretty damn good and would add greatly to the selection, but they chose to make them just cars to pass by or get in your way.-Tuning is pretty much non-existant, the only thing you're doing is upgrading parts, not tuning. Static upgrades. No body tuning, or engine tuning. The spec kits are the only thing that 'tune' your car.•Misc-G27 and other wheel controller support is still awkward and the Force Feedback is not good to play with, it jerks the wheel randomly and you're constantly fighting it, no matter if your on Sports or Hardcore, you have to turn Force feedback down to play with a wheel enjoyably-Personally I don't really like nitrous boosts in games, but that's just my peeve, the mechanic is there so note that.-Crew system has problems with disconnecting at the end of missions, instancing, etc.-The Police are ridiculous during missions or higher level stars, like they're psychopaths who got a Police car and want to kill you at the cost of killing themselves, and suffer from the typical AI problems.-Physics are ridiculous, as the community calls them Cat-Physics, your car will try it's best to stay on all 4 wheels, which causes ridiculous things to happen if your wheels get off center.-Text Chat censors such stupid letter combinations making it impossible to have normal conversations.On the topic of drifting; If you want to know what kit is best for drifting, it's Street. It use to be Dirt, but the handling changes made the the dirt kit less optimal for that.I will add on more to this review as I play more.•Summary.-The AI is Terrible and Unfair-Customization is more limited then it should be(It doesn't need to be NFS Underground, but it can easily be better then what it is)-Car selection is very uninspired and bland.-Currently doing missions in a crew has issues and kicks people out of the game and having their rewards lost.-Nitrous is a mechanic and is pretty much needed to be used in missions.-G27/Wheel support needs work-Assets in the game that should be used but aren't.-Game is still unfinished even after a Release delay, unobtainable kits cause they're not ""finished"".-No user radio for immersion sake, and the music selection is very boring. You'll have to resort to listening to your own music outside of the game.-Missions due to the AI aren't fun-Popo are not fun and you might as well let them catch out outside of missions if your star level is too high.-Text Chat censors are terrible, and was rushed.-Physics are counter-intuitive and can mess you up especially during jumps.-There is no Tuning, changing Specs is the only 'tuning' you'll get.Wait for a discount or hold off until more updates come out. It's not that fun in its current state. It has the potential to be fun, just not currently. "

After that they made 3 proper dlc's which is pricy and ofc you wont get with the season pass. if its very cheap and you love crusing around this is the game for you. if you look for more than that keep away.

												This game has a huge map and that is awesome for a mmo car game, but the storyline is only about 30 to 40 hours long.There are pvp lobbies where you can race with others but they are on full upgraded cars most of the time and the only way you are going to beat them, is when they crash in the race. Cars are well detailed and there is a incar view, some cars you can only get if you buy their dlc which is expensive (drift and drag races included in dlc)			"

												-I've read people say this is sort of what TDU/2 is supposed to have been. I never played them. The nearest to open world racing I have experienced is Burnout Paradise. My comparisons will be based on Paradise.   First, the main draw, I think, is the sheer scope. Meant to represent the continental USA, the game world is huge and divided into 5 sections: East coast, west coast, the South, Midwest, and Mountain. In each region, there is a handful of towns, of varying sizes from the region. the South for example, has Nashville, New Orleans, Miami(which is one of the 5 major cities in the game), Dallas, and others. The midwest, where the beta starts and focuses on, has Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis.  Between them and the west coast is  Las Vegas and the desert, as well as other towns.Detroit, St. Louis, and Chicago had landmark areas to visit that would give a quick sentence or two on a neighborhood, factory( Detroit's Ford factory included). Unfortunately I can't say I know anything about the 3 cities in game where landmarks are described, so i don't know how many are real or not.-What about that open-world, no loading screen driving?Well, the game touts being able to drive ""coast to coast"". You can do that. If you don't want to, pull into a town, and feel free to use the train station or airport as a sort of fast travel to different towns.  You can actually fast travel to any specific spot you've driven to. What this means is I start in Detroit, fly to Miami or San Francisco, drive to the nearby wilderness, warp to detroit, and warp back to that isolated desert plateau.Speaking of towns and landmarks, some regions have real world race tracks or mountain trails. Pike's Peak is very close to St. Louis, while Mazda's Laguna Seca course is close to the western coast line. There are other trails  and tracks, but those were the two I personally visited and ran. For those of you curious, Pike's Peak is in its gravel glory.-There's a lot of driving, what kind of driving is it?Well, it isn't as arcadey as Burnout Paradise,Initial D, Fast and Furious, or other arcade machine driving games. With that said, it isn't Gran Turismo, Forza, or Rfactor either. Users of steering setups like Logitech's G27 can expect to use all 3 pedals if they so choose. I personally made use of the 360 controller for pc, and while it wasn't as perfect as a wheel could be, I did fairly well. Controller users, expect some slight difficulty shifting in default controls. Using the Right analog stick up and down as sequential shifting works well enough until you need to reverse. Likewise, don't expect to be precise on throttle and brake using the left and right triggers. The boost button is the ""A"" button, which means boosting as you shift WILL be awkward and slow you down. Having one of the wheels is definitely going to be a better experience in fun and outright skill.As far as tuning your vehicles go, expect more ""MMO"", less ""simulation"" and ""racing"". For example, I completed a quick event while cruising and got a new ECU. it added +2 to braking. When you buy your car and it's considered ""full stock"", you will see some real stats: Torque, max speed,  weight, drivetrain layout, 0-60 time. Once you begin upgrading it however, those will be replaced bby more MMO styled representations. My 370Z car in ""Street"" spec had a speed of 63xx, and after getting various unlocks, it ended up around 66xx. This may seem confusing, and I apologize if my description has lost you. Here's the bottom line: DO NOT EXPECT YOUR CAR TO HANDLE WITH SPECIFIC INPUTS AS IF THIS IS FORZA OR GT. The game definitely caters more to the feel/perception of driving than the technical  know-how and experience.*Note I've only played GT5, which is a decent ""sim"" for consoles, but  probably isn't the most in-depth driving sim either. It is a good comparison to this game and Burnout Paradise though.*Viisually, car mods are well done. Swap bumpers, hoods, trunk spoilers, interior material, and paint. Bonus points for rally lights and snorkels for ""Dirt"" spec cars. Each part and sticker fits right. The cars are simply beautiful to look at. As you get damaged, paint scrrapes off, bumpers begin to hang off, glass gets cracked. Did you drive off-road? you've probably collected some mud.So, the game's called ""The Crew"". Where's said crew? (Multiplay)If you see a player you want to crew with, simply bring the menu up, select their trading card, and invite them. Once in a crew, the whole team (up to 4) can do most single-play events. If one player wins it, the whole team wins it. Got a friend that loves off-road, and another that specializes in hitting the apex on a hill climb or track? the off-road guy can do track events with the track guy. Team wins, off-roader can move on. Same with the track nut being able to sort of get carried through off-road events. The notes are true: *no* load times. You can drive from Detroit to San Fran without seeing a load screen. ***Except for  a noticable 2-6 seconds transition to and from map screen. So what happens when you are in Detroit and your friends are already in San Fran? Well, if you've been to the spot they are at, you can simply fast travel directly on top of them. Otherwise, unfortunately, you guys have a bit of a drive to meet up unless you take a bus or plane. For better or worse, you can't see every player that is online in your world. the game seems to split players into ""Sessions"". You can freely see players on your map if they are in your session. Whether your friends are in your session or not, you can crew with them. Animals and perhaps other things aren't synced. A friend was running over some boars in a forest while I watched him do donuts in an open field. Weather does seem to be synced though.I tried to cover some of the technical aspects above. Driving physics and handling, the open world aspect, and multiplay.The truth is, I had a fun time being in a crew with 2 friends, and going from meeting them near Laguna Seca, to driving for 20 minutes sowe could hit Pike's Peak. Yes, there's  a single player story revolving around underground street racing and gang drama...but what I and my friends enjoyed most, was getting in our cars, and just driving. I was using a Ford Focus, while my friends were using a Dodge Charger and a Ford Mustang. As we were traveling, I had to really struggle at times to keep them in my view. My god it was glorious. Sometimes they let off the throttle, or we paused to swap to different cars. After switching to my street car (370z) I was able to keep good pace and even pass them. At that point, we were able to just trail each other closely. Buy/consider  this game if:-You enjoy driving just to cruise. (Part of the charm is the 20 min drive)-You don't need/want very technical, realistic driving. OR You don't mind a driving game with somewhat..exaggerated characteristics.-You like open world games-You like cars-MMO/RPG type progression is ok to you: redoing missions for more XP/cash, less than accurate tuning( see above for ECU adding +2 to braking stat )- Simply looking for another game to use that steering wheel/pedal/shifter set for.Maybe skip the game if:-the idea of an always-online game isn't fun to you- You need/strongly desire simulation/realistic handling, roads, etc. The game makes some heavy compromises in each area.-You prefer more traditional racing, such as Forza and GT for track racing; Colin McRae/Dirt for Rally/ light off-roading.-you hate Uplay. (I had some very damning problems separate from the game)-Not a fan of MMO's or grinding to level up the player or cars.-You don't really want to use peripherals like a steering wheel, or analog controller. Like a real car, slight throttle, brake, and steering inputs will be the difference between a smooth drive and constantly smacking cars and guard rails.			"

												The game is quite fun, and I have spent many hours in it, and will probably spend more too. However... there are some pretty big caveats to this. The price for one; I have the Australia tax, and the base game costs $75USD, not including the exchange rate and everything. Then there is the DLC - each one is a pack of 4 extra cars, hardly worth the price considering they don't really offer too much more. And then there are the Mi-crew-transactions. Seriously? Extra in-game micro transactions on an already pretty pricey Triple A release? There are two different forms of currency in-game, one which is solely earnt through missions, skills, and stunts. And then there are CREW CREDITS. You are given 100,000 reasonably early on in the game, but that's not enough for anything good. And so... you are invited to use real life money to purchase these in order to quickly obtain cars or specs that you would otherwise spend countless hours grinding for. The grind for this game is pretty ridiculous - not only do you have to grind for in-game cash (unless you pay real money) for the cars, but then, upgrade those cars, you must complete skill challenges to acquire parts to improve your car... for each individual car. The best parts are also RNG based, so you could easily spend hours farming the same challenge to try and get that specific part you wanted.In contrast to some others, I've had no issues with Uplay, but this could just mean I'm one of the lucky ones. Unlike some of the Trailers, the world isn't as filled - this is both a good and bad thing. If you like PVP, well, you'll be in for a long wait. But otherwise, the comparative lack of players is actually a bit of a blessing in disguise. Particularly if you are farming money or parts, the smaller population sizes actually makes it much easier to do what you want without getting in each other's way, which is extremely inconvenient and can be extremely aggravating. One of the biggest draws, the co-op, doesn't really seem to work completely as well, sometimes crews doing a mission won't finish properly. That said, it is still incredibly awesome to drive around America with a group of friends, or accept a random online invite if you prefer that instead. There can, however, still be connection issues even within a crew, so that is something to keep in mind if you plan on primarily playing the game in multiplayer. You'll also want to do this with a friend, playing with strangers online can be dicey and very hit and miss.The campaign is pretty standard and boring despite how short it is - done and dusted in about 7 or 8 hours. The campaign really offers nothing new, interesting, or relevant. It's very cliche with some pretty glaring plot holes. I enjoyed cruising around the map in free roam doing whatever I wanted more than completing the campaign.This brings me to by far, the best part of the game - the world map. The Drive is the best open world driving experience I've had by far, with you literally able to drive from Canada to Mexico and coast to coast with an incredibly diverse environment to explore, with vast tracks of open road and off road land to discover. Many cities are either scaled down or removed completely, understandable but potentially annoying to some - I never had an issue with it, it would not make sense to make everything completely to scale. The exploration of the map is great, although sometimes the game feels more like a tourist guide... noting landmarks like the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam. Regardless, the environments are fantastic, from the dense urban cities of Los Angeles and New York, to snowy mountains, deserts, and swamps. The time and environmental system in The Crew is also well worth talking about. From snow, rain, cloud, and sun, the weather is quite well, although rain does not affect driving as much as it should. The day/night system is a highlight, although sometimes streetlamps and headlights turn on and off at weird times... The poor standard of NPC traffic is a let-down. Not only in terms of how they look, but also in terms of how they spawn and despawn. I understand that this is to reduce the stress of the game, but it still looks odd to see other vehicles randomly appearing or vanishing, especially at night time, where headlights are the only thing which shows other road users.Now to the gameplay. The driving and racing offers nothing spectacular, although the game's physics and hit boxes are inconsistent. On one hand, it's pretty good to see a driving game where your car accumulates visible damage. However, repair prices are exorbitant, and the damage does not seem to effect the car's performance. Then there are odd times where you hit another car or object... sometimes you get the ""crash cam"", sometimes you spin to the side, sometimes you flip, sometimes you are bumped backwards or sideways... but there doesn't seem to be much  consistency. And sometimes you'll be sent flying over rocks or curbs through invisible walls. It can be entertaining to see your million-dollar car flip and tumble... but also frustrating and physically wrong. I feel the handling is quite poor in the game, with strangely large turning circles, the surprisingly high propensity to skid (not drift), something exacerbated off-road. Landing after jumps is also poorly handled, and you always land nose first, generally but not always, causing you flip and crash.There isn't too much racing in this game, with a variety of other missions such as ""disable"" or ""deliver"", but the game's AI is very frustrating and completely unrealistic. Regardless of how your car is upgraded, the AI will always be right on your tail. Collisions will ALWAYS affect you more negatively than the other car hit, regardless of whether it's a race or police pursuit, and who intitiated the contact. And the police pursuits are not fun either. Pursuits only start if you hit a street lamp, but you will be ignored if you speed through a red light at four times the speed limit past a police car? And then, when the pursuit starts, it's actually quite impractical to see the police cars catch up to you... it just doesn't make sense that a random squad car could catch up to a supercar and then insta-stop and bust you. The speed with which you get caught, and subsequently the amount you get fined, make police pursuits far more trouble than fun. The traffic can also behave oddly, especially at lights and when merging.And then, finally, the cars themselves. I really love the fact that most of the cars are licensed, and have official paints, rims, etc. There are exceptions though, such as the two RUF cars. The stature of the cars is further refined by the 5 different classes, or specs - Street, Dirt, Performance, Race, Circuit - which are all noticeably different to each other, in both looks and performance. This is in contrast to some other games, where differences such as Rally or Muscle cars actually really don't offer much difference in terms of gameplay. In The Crew, the different classes all have their own strengths and weaknesses, and perform differently. Even with the classes, however, the selection of cars is really quite limited, especially if you do not purchase the DLC. While there is a reasonably large range of physical modifications available (bumpers, hoods, spoilers, etc.), these customisation options lack depth and are limited. And some, like the license plates, are barely noticeable. That said, you are able to do some incredibly fun and potentially silly things. Like drive a Mini Cooper down a ski ramp like THE STIG, or hit 300km/h in a Fiat or Dodge SRT.It's months post release, but there are still bugs  - getting stuck or going through environmental hazards, , and graphical glitches where roads vanish or turn strange colours... Don't get me wrong, I enjoy The Crew, and it isn't bad, per se, but it's hard to justify the price, especially with microtransactions thrown in.			"

												I've played since the first beta, both open and closed beta.  I know you're worried about it being Ubisoft - no worries, it's flawless.  I'm 30 years old.  I've been playing racing games since Pole Position in the 1980s on my Mac.  I've played everything from the 1990s hit Gran Turismo 1 to the brand new Mario Kart 8 on Wii U.  Simply put, The Crew is one of my favorite racing games ever.  It is a unique racing MMORPG like none other. Freakin' massive, gorgous, and varied open world to explore, the best open world since Skyrim. Tons of players everywhere. Nice co-op and PvP. Lots of different and varied missions/quests all over. Surprisingly decent story about gangs and the FBI. Tons of things to level up and customzie. Incredible graphics, one of the best looking games period. Tight and responsive controls that work perfectly. Very unique and just what racing games needed. Any fan of racing/driving must check this out, it's much better than I expected it to be. The game runs absolutely flawlessly with not a single bug in sight.  You can spend hours not doing any missions and just driving around and soaking in the world.  It's  racing game with the addictiveness of an MMORPG and it's is very hard to stop playing.  I can see this game eating hundreds of hours of my free time.9/10 -  Does it have flaws?  Sure but they are nothing major that prevents the game from being a blast.  It combines the best of the best of the best racing games.  Gran Turnismo, DiRT, Hot Purtsuit, and too many to name.  The Crew is the  biggest surprise in many years.  An abolsute must buy for any racing fan. The Crew isn't just a good racing game, it's a good game period.			"

The Game is now released and out of Beta so time for an updated review. The handling is going to take some getting used to coming from a game like iRacing, the game looks great and feels good too. My computer did not even break a sweat running it!So far I have enjoyed my gameplay time with the Crew, but it has been rather rough ride now I am a Crew fan boy but will speak honestly about the game.There is plenty of places to drive to, with lots of streets to cover, all the locations and streets have real names which adds to the fun. There are alot of skill missions to do.Crew up is fun and is always good laugh, but sometimes has issue'sI was very happy to see it worked straight away with my G27 wheel and clubsport elite pedals which was mainly what i was worried about.

There are some cons,  the voice over sounds alot like Aiden Pearce from watchdogs, no mirrors lol, what car game doesn't have mirrors maybe they thought everyone would spend the race in last so they were not needed, level 50 max level you will reach which took me 10 hours, the story is built on very basic foundation.Steering feels good but does take little messing around to find sweet spot, I can't complain too much but it reminds me alot of TDU2, its all in finding the right settings.I have a modified FFB G27 with bigger motors and I had the FFB slider on full, this almost broke my damn fingers, lots of colourful language came out then.My overall thoughts this game has average content to offer one the story is complete your left with not much but skill missions which get old really quick, my concern for this game is the future they have plans for more car DLC but not alot to do with the cars, this game is good for car person such as myself but casual gamer may get bored pretty quick.

												Its time for me to write my very first Review, and its going to be about The Crew.This, was a fun game with a lot of potential, but Team Ubi and Ivory Tower Turned it into... well, into what it is now,I've spent some hours on it, there are ppl with more hours than me but anyway, people might think that somebody with a lot of time spent on a game would obviously recommend itbut thing is, i saw it going down slowly... and the potential got wasted.First lets state the important and obvious details about this game:Not sure if i should list this as pros and cons, so i'll just list the good and bad about each feature:-Specs: This is of the main features of this game, i even dare to say its the core to the crew's gameplay, when i just played it, it was cool as you see when you pick your first vehicle, you can have every spec on that vehicle, That being, Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit(drag, drift and Monster truck if you have WR Expansion but i'll get to that later), but as you progress in the game you start noticing that its only incomplete, while this is indeed a cool feature, its quite lacking, most of the vehicles in the game only come in Perf spec, wich is annoying, yeah, we get it, not anybody would turn a Lamborghini Aventador into a raid vehicle, but thats the fun part of a video game, do things you can't do in real life, So, as for the specs, i find it quite lacking, specially because some of my favorite vehicles only come in one spec... -Customization: When this game came out, there wasn't a lot of racing games with this option, So this was a nice adition to someone's library who is looking for a nice racing game with this feature, while its not perfect, its decent, but as i said, its not perfect, why? first, choosing the color, you have to choose from an already existing color list, if your favorite color is not there, you are screwed, the parts you can choose from, some are nice, but i wish they were better, you can't choose  your wheels color, customization parts are only for Street, Dirt, and Performance specs, Raid and Circuit, you can only change paint, decals and wheels, there are some elements on the customization menu that are actually empty and only makes you wonder why the heck are they there?? like the Fender one, That being said, Customization is there, it sorta do its part, but i just wish it was way better, like letting you blend your own paint, put the materials you wish on whatever part you wish, etc.-Graphics and optimization: The graphics are not top notch but for me, they were enough to say it looks good, specially after the visual overhaul they did, not much else to say. As for the optimization, it sucks, there are graphic glitches that are still there from the very beggining of the game,like the stuttering, doesn't matter how amazing or beefy its your computer, it will ALWAYS stutter and have fps drops randomly.-Gameplay: a lot of people find it bad, it feels stiff, clunky or whatever, as for me, its good, the controls are not that bad, the races andevents are good(but quite lacking...) the physics are quite odd but not odd enough to ruin the game, the best part of the gameplay? you have a really big world to play, the bad part of it? the devs were lazy enough to cover all that ground with all kind of events and racing tracks, instead, they added a game mode where players can create their own races, wich its not that bad, but not that good either, a poor excuse to cut work and let players do the devs work.So, overall, the gameplay its just Decent.-PvP: while i have'nt spend a lot of time on pvp, i can say that its only for those with very good conection, or else you will just get glitchy af races with oddly moving trafic, pvp its indeed one of the main features of the gameplay, and at first it was amazing, but with time less and less players were available to play with, it still have a good playerbase but still  feels a bit dead sometimes, cant really say much about pvp so i'll just leave it on NeutralAnd now comes the fun part: the dlcs-Wild Run: To me it was a nice addition with a lot of potential in the beggining, why? cuz it would keep new vehicles coming monthly to the game, so it was worth it a try, also, it came with new Specs, Drift, Drag and MT, new events, wich could get better with time, but actually didn't, at first, new vehicles were suposed to come montly, then, every 2 months, now, 3 months, wich sucks, each summit event its the same and the same, the yjust repeat it on different days, never updated it, and now, the just announced that they wont be rewarding new vehicles on the montly summit, they will just reward already existing vehicles, as for players who already have those, we have nothing else to do in the summit.The extreme specs are also lacking, why? only a few vehicles can have SOME of them, and most are badly designed, why? i'll just say this, you can't have a drag classic muscle car, and honestly, classic muscle cars are meant to be drag cars... Drift, can't really be done outside of the summit, you can play with drift spec, but no point to it, there are not a lot of drift events you can play multiplayer.MT, same as drift. Seriously, they didn't think about adding cool MT races on the mountains or smething? Overall, WR HAD a lot of potential, that got wasted over time, as of now, its just bad.-Calling all units: when they first announced this, it was a good addition to the game, when it came out, it was the typical McDonalds burger Meme, its not as good as they made it sound.The Story mode for CaU is there, pontless, but its there, the new character, Clara, sounds like unmotivated dubbing actress(or actor...) who only knows how to speak with sarcasm, the story misions are just boring and pointless.The Police SPec its completely lacking, only a very small slection of police vehicles its available, its not that hard to add every single spec available in this game into the police lineup, they just needed to add the paint job to the existing body kits and add some police lights... but that would mean work for the devs so screw it. Currently, there are only a few police players, mainly because not a lof of ppl bought the EP, wich i'd say it was wise.The crate events are quite boring without police players to chase you, and reward you vehicles that you can buy with ingame money, again if you have every vehcle, this is a pointless activity.Skills, are there, they do what they are suposed to do, but not a big addition to the game.The new vehicles are only a few, and also, made me angry about them, if u had complete edition or something similar before CaU release, you just got a Nissan GTR that anybody could get, and a Lambo Huracan that now EVERYONE can use, no longer require CaU, so, basically, you could wear a T-Shirt saying ""i gave the devs al ot of money and all i got was this♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.So, in the end, why can't i recommed this game? in its current state, it feels lacking and incomplet, it gives the feeling that they just starting to not give a ""turd"" about this game anymore, so if they dont care, we should stop giving them money.TL;DR This game had potential, that they never developed at its fullest,now its just plain boring and feels like an incomplete game.This is not a definitive review, might change over time, but as of now, i dont suggest to buy this game, get it if its on sale, like 50% off or something, its not worth its price, don't buy half game for a full game price...

												Dont buy it. Dont make the mistake i made.-Cars handle like driving on soap with no difference between fourwheel, rearwheel or frontwheel. It literally makes no difference. I did a burnout with the rear wheels in a Ford Focus.-No character development. It tries really hard to sell you a dramatic tone but doesnt even touches on bonding with the npcs. Every mission feels like a chore with dull dialog, repetitive gameplay and all around cliche premises.Simply the worst, most overhyped piece of garbage I have ever laid hands on.P.S.  Dont even try to use a steering wheel with this.... Makes it basically unplayable.I feel ripped off			"

												I enjoy this game immensly, its a great game. great graphics, great fun to just drive around and explore. HOWEVER, I bought the gold edition when it came out, which included the season pass. but DIDN'T include the Wild Run DLC. which, frankly, is stupid. almost ALL new actual content, that would keep me playing the game for things other than just driving around, is in Wild Run. Dropping more money into a game to get something that should of come with the season pass is just discusting business practice. though, we all know how much to expect from ubisoft.however, don't let that prevent you from enjoying what is, actually, a really good game. I still manage to have hours of fun in it, literally just driving around exploring the absolutely MASSIVE map. even after I think I've driven around the whole thing, I have still missed spots. And you get a few good hours out of the story, so what I did buy was worth it, even without wild run. I would buy Wild Run if you were getting it now though, because thats where all the stuff to do is.EDIT: One other thing I would like to add, This game is what? 2+ years old now? its still getting regular updates, which is actually seriously good, especially for something by Ubisoft.

												Graphics: 8/10, and pretty well optimized.Everyone seems to be complaining about the handling, which I thought to be pretty okay, though I have next to no experience with racing/car games, so I can't say much.Was fun until I realized that much of the online content, tuners, vehicles, races, events, and just about every other aspect must be unlocked with DLC, which is shoved down your throat at every possible moment. Why show events on the map that players can't participate in?Overall: a nice, cool, 3/10.			"

												Im rating this as a positive review because i had alot of fun at first.I really like car games, however, the crew does not have even remotely realistic physics. If you are looking for a game that is even slightly realistic, I urge you, go elsewhere. If you are looking for an openworld cruising/racing arcade style car game, this may be fun for you.There are so many problems in this game that I am not going to list them all but here are some of them:      a)Cars feel like they are floating through corners, drifting is nearly impossible even with a drift kit (you have to buy one before you can drift for more than a few feet) due to the fact that the game doesnt rely on a realistic physics engine for drifting, i.e. loss of traction to the rear wheels (or all four for AWD) instead it chooses a 'brake to drift' style, simply turn and hope for the best.      b) Cars take forever to upgrade, and the process isnt exciting, you simply do a single jump over and over, 10s of 100s of times, untill you get what parts you want. This process is comepletely random, no matter how skilled you are at the game or how high of a score you get, you will get the same thing, at total random.      c) The Physics for offroading and jumps is absolutely trash. You can flip your car at the slightest provocation, and it is not consistent at all. One second, you can drive right over a large boulder with ease. The very next second, a tiny rock will somehow flip your whole car. Also, you cannot continue to roll back over while still in the air (barrel roll), so if the car flips it counts as a wreck, even if you would have landed correctly.Honestly, if you like car games that give you control over your car, wait for Forza Horizon 3. Its just over a month and a half away. do yourself a favor here.			"

												Just don't go in expecting a ton from this game and it's ok. The story makes no sense and the characters talk WAY too much but just driving around with friends is pretty fun. I got the game on sale, I'd never pay full price for this.			"

												Well, as I had been waiting for this ever since it was announced, I obviously bought the Gold Edition of the game. Just because the game was looking really interesting and something that I could spend hours on, just by looking at the videos, screenshots, etc of the game.I took my time with the story, I didn't want to rush it, just because there was so much other stuff to do around the world (exploring, skill challenges, side missions and so on) but eventually, when I completed the story, I pretty much stopped playing the game. I had already seen pretty much everything the game had to offer, the missions and everything just kinda became repetive. Of course the exploration part was still there in the game, as the map is massive so it's going to take a good while to explore the whole map, but as much I did enjoy driving around in the game, I just couldn't find the interest in exploring the whole map.Here's a list of the pros and cons in the game, and then in the end of the review, a small summary.Pros- Decent graphics- 5 different specs available for vehicles in the game (Not every car has all of the specs, though)- Big map- Interesting story- Decently made cars- Good amount of music in the game- Good performance- Amazingly detailed interiors in vehicles- Ingame awards- PVP events- Decent handling (A lot of people have said that the handling is bad, but in my opinion, it's pretty decent)- Good car customization options  - There could be more customization options in the game, but the ones that are in the game work just fine when customizing a vehicleCons:- Short story (Even though it was interesting, it still was short)- Crew Credits (You don't need to buy these (with real money) in order to progress quicker in the game, but they do help you a lot if you want to buy that Lamborghini quickly and not spend a few hours farming money to get it)- Crash cutscenes are horrible- The AI  - Opponent AI is impossible, when your car level is 1299 and their car level is 299, they still catch up to you in a second and are always right behind you  - Traffic AI can be pretty buggy sometimes- uPlay  - I would be so much happier if they could just ditch uPlay and move it to Steam. Probably one of the biggest problems that I have with uPlay is that when I open the ingame overlay, it freezes the gameOverall, I have to recommend the game. Even though it has a lot of bad things in it, it's still a pretty damn good game for people who enjoy games like this. I had a lot of fun playing the game, even with the problems it had.So, should you buy this game?Yes, if.. You enjoy games like Test Drive Unlimited 2 or Driver San Francisco and you want to spend that 50€-75€ (depending on if you buy the Gold Edition or the Stock Edition + Season Pass or just the Stock Edition) on the game, but I'd recommend buying this when it's on a sale rather than paying the full price for it.No, if.. You're into realistic racing simulators, this is not one of them.EDIT: Review updated since a lot of cons have been fixed.			"

												I will recommend this game but read carefully!As always, i read most helpful not recommended reviews and i will try to sum them up here.My opinion: Huge map is tolerating all the cons of this game. I am just happy about crusing around.Cons:Server issues happens sometime and game does not start at allThe wild run expansion changes the game a little bit even you do not have it, but when you see an event and try to enter, message says you have to install wild run. This is ridicuolus.The concept is wonderful. having a crew to compete against others is what makes racing fun. But there is not much reason to look for players on the map because most online players are busy with PVP events. And the story is not urging you to play as a group. Good concept, bad execution.PVP events (online races) are open to everyone and if you have not completed most of the game you will most probably be beaten to smoke. Cuz you will not have platinum parts from skills on the map and therefore other players with platinum parts will be flying away from you. This could be understandable, if there were a proper match making algorithm.Physics are not realistic, mostly like an arcade game.There are weird glitches like flying to the moon all of a sudden.And i do not see any other flaws in the game. Here are the pros:The map is huge and the visuals are aweome. (Some optimizations could be better)The soundtrack in missions are awesome but they do not play in freeroam. You have to listen to radio in freeroam. Radio contains classical music, ambient music, rap, rock, electornic... A wide range.Story is easy because most of the time, you are given a car to ride. so you do not have to have an expensive car in your pocket all the time. And when you need one, there are like a hundred of different skill actions which gives you new parts.Physics are weird for a racing game but just right for an open world game. This is not a simulation. Remember Need for Speed Most Wanted from 2006. The physics reminds me of that game, and it was too an amazing game.5 different camera angels are all yours to select. Some games has only 2.Cars are divided into multiple types. So you can go off road with a dirt car or completely out into the wild with a raid car. You can have a hypercar (performance car) to travel in light speed. I actually do not understand the Street cars :D Circuit cars are ideal for point to point agile drivng. How much more diversity do you want?There is a faction system, which is kind of a mafia wars over the whole map, but it does not much mean to belong to one faction. This is a good idea but no one cares about it.There are faction races to increase your factions reputation. These races can be less than 10 mins or longer than an hour. There are two particular races, one is like 3.5 hours long dirt race and the other is a 2 hours long performance race. BTW, this was my childhood dream. An hours long race which does not involve looping the same track.So if you do not mind some server issues, sloppy physics, out of the concept gameplay and some glitches, this game is a great openworld racing game.

												This game is great if you want to explore a massive and detailed open world. I would say the map is about 5 times as large as gta 5's and is about a dense but there are no interactions with pedestrians and you are restricted to just your car.  Don't expect too much but overall the game is fun and if you like exploration you could easily sink 50 or so hours into it.			"

												corners were cut, drastically. im not even gonna bother writing an actual review since all the reviews under most helpful are quite literally on point. the game needs more cars, period. how can you have cars be customizable for dirt and not have a subaru or evo? you have an f150 but no cars that people actually tune in real life?THIS IS NOT A RACING GAME. IT IS A MMO WITH CARS. races arent races theyre point a to b and no matter how good you are and dont crash or spinout (which btw is very hard to do with the crappy handling) the other cars are still right behind you. cant tell you how many times ive gotten to the end of a mission and a car/school bus spawns right in front of me and i crash and lose the faction misson ive been working on for the last 2 1/2 hours.  buy this game if its on sale dont pay full price for this uncompleted game. i got it for 40$ and change and its barely worth the money. its a good game to screw around in. and as far as the season pass goes, if youre gonna buy the game might as well get the season pass. otherwise youll be stuck in your first car for a while. only way to win decent money is faction missions. story missions barely give you 2k and an r34 costs over $100,000? okay buddyI REALLLLLLYYY wanted to love this game but unfortunately as everything ubisoft has had their name on lately, its a disappointment			"

												This was one of the games I was looking foward to this year. But it does so little in the areas where it matters most that it falls short of where other existing games pass with flying colors.Sure I love the visuals of the game and it plays decently well, but the focus of the game is cars and... There's quite a lack of focus in general on them. From what I can see, there's only 40 cars that you can get from dealerships yet this game has one problem that a lot of these style of games have. They tend to favour one or two manufacturers over the rest and that leaves the variety pretty thin, especially when you only have 40 cars and around 1/7th of them are Fords.Another thing is customization. If you wanted to make awesome murals or just a silly paintjob for your ride, I got two words for you, ""You can't"". The customization feels like it came right from need for speed most wanted (2005) but with even less content then you would even think of. I can't even change the color of my Dodge Viper since there's only 1 color for it and it's terrible.That's another thing. Everytime I get a racing game, I make it a personal objective to get a Dodge Viper because who doesn't strive to earn their favorite car? But I practically started off with it. You can't buy it but instead, use Uplay award points to buy it and then BAM! Instant car... I already feel like I have nothing to work towards in the game now and I only just started it...In comparison to Test Drive Unlimited 2. This game has much greater visuals and world design and also doesn't have those annoying houses that make it take forever to manage your cars. But lacks in everywhere else like car selection veriaty, customization and pay to win mechanics. Yes, this game has paid for currency in it which you can use to buy skill points that give passive benefits to your stats or immediate access to any car.			"

												There will be no objectivity in this review, just my opinion on THIS stuff.First question for now is ""what the hell?"" I preordered this game in 2014 with season pass, I was waiting for it, it was something new to me, just whoah, look, you can drive through all the USA(okay, almost all). After release I played about 60 hrs and then gave up, because I bought and upgraded all the cars I wanted to 1299, after this it was nothing to do anymore. Between this time and WR release I entered The Crew couple of times just to check new cars(imho there are not so good to buy season pass).Wild Run. Okay, when I was watching all these trailers, reading news I thought ""okay, this can be really interesting"", but after WR release I understood, that all my thoughts were... wrong. Three new useless types of cars? Really, anyone used them anywhere except summit challenges? I haven't ever seen someone was driving through on drift or dragster or monster truck. I played in WR, participated in summit, even won something but I was still asking myself: ""really, i paid for this??"" Maybe I didn't know about some features?Calling All Units. I thought I won't have to pay for it *sigh* And I will NOT buy this, because it's just stupid. I preordered The Crew+SP, bought WR and now I need to buy CAU. And also I'm offered to buy Ultimate version which is much cheaper than buying The Crew+SP, then WR and then CAU. Nice job, well done, good game :/ Okay, we got it. But it's not all. Where's my lambo Huracan? I can't see her in my garage. Is it so hard just to add one car to ""veteran"" players? And why the hell I can be arrested when cop is driving near me with the same speed? Some guy arrested me on 200+ km/h... Just what? It's not funny, even if you are a cop.So, we got(imho) useless Season Pass, useless WIld Run and Calling All Units, not useless, but though I'm not sure after what happened. I am very dissapointed. The Crew had great potential, but Ivory Tower(or maybe its Ubi fault, don't know) think in another way. Yes, it was fun to travel around the USA, but without these DLCs game feels incomplete. That's not the way how it should work.P.S. optimization on PC isn't good at all too.			"

												The Idea is neat, but the execution could have been better.The Crew expects you to grind, with more of the racing part feeling uninspiring and disconnected , But the FreeRoam is what  makes it Damn Good. You can Drive Cross-country and like in reality, You'd actually stop and take pictures. Not sure what other game makes people do this.+ Huge World to explore.+ Free Roam mode.++++Cockpit View.+++++ Photo mode+ Plenty of Cars/ Bikes with different specs.+ Weather system.+ Events/modes.+ NOW FREE ON UBISTORE [ Limited time, although i bought it on steam]+ Dev Support, after all these years, new content coming.+- An MMO ??!! PvP matches need better matchmaking(or needs to force a common level of cars for all players), oh and kids, learn to drive without pushing other people. This pushing is 90% of PvP. +- Controls need tweaking, a bit of manual modding and it's a lotta fun. +- A texture update would do wonders [fully maxed and some areas are just flat, but i guess its showing its age]- Story- Disconected Racing experience- DLCs [guess the new cops and robbers dlc might change that]- Grind for upgrades.- AIDont be thrown off by the negative reviews, most are from people who dont know to activate the steam bought version in Uplay. And i've never had any issues with Uplay whatsoever or these supposed glitches everyone keeps saying about the game. Some reviews are just plain mundane and pointless, and others disliking it after playing a good deal of hours. Real mature, people. I play this game mostly for fun and relaxation, and sometimes the races, Most times exploring the map in freeroam listening to trance music. Driving at daybreak(in cockpit view ofc) on the interstate in a Lamborghini and seeing the sun rise between the mountains or drifting up an icy mountain off road and reaching the top is just a great feeling. I honestly expect the game to be revived next year as a good  racing   Driving sim title in steam.i give it a 7/10 now and an 8/10 after the new dlc releases. More stuff to do. Hopefully.			"

Driving and diving / Ecco the GolfinI've grown to love The Crew.I play it like an underwater diving game, only on land. Turn on the soapy ingame ambient radio. Dial down the engine sounds. Switch off the player tag cloud that shows which people are nearby. Mark a place on the map I want to go to.And then it's just peaceful gliding through landscapes of varying quality. Some are blander than others, sometimes the trees look like big matches stuck in the ground. I mostly enjoy the different kitschy light situations. Sunrise, sundown, The Crew's sun always finds new ways to surprise me and to colour everything in different ways.The MMO part, or let's say, the social component, seems like a total failure to me. I never saw anybody use the chat, unlike in TDU2, where people would often park their cars somewhere and have little group conversations that made it clear there were actual people in these cars. The only human contact I had during my 30 hours with The Crew was players trying to ram me into oblivion.Maybe it's my fault, but whilst TDU2 was The Sims on wheels,  The Crew seems to attract a crowd that's more into, well, driving, not chatting. That's okay, I guess.I enjoy driving. I wish more of my friends on Steam would take the plunge, but then again, driving around together could be very boring, I don't know? I suppose one has to be a proper bore to find diving-driving interesting.I play The Crew to relax and the game is successful at that.			"

												Everyone complains about the season pass not including the Wild Run DLC,ok it's true it's a robbery! but what is fair in life?That doesn't mean that the game itself isn't good,for me,atleast it's the best racing game i've plaied in a while! (since tdu 2 launched in 2011).I had bought this game on a sale a few days ago,plaied almost 30 hours straight and from the experience i got in the game i can assure you about the next things:1.No crashes(i don't know if u have crashes,your PC is the problem)2.No bugs,i haven't fell trough map not even once,neither glitched into a wall or something3.There are still pretty many people online out there...i tought it would be worse4.No one talks about the free graphic ,,DLC"" wich ubisoft gave us for free! i have had only plaied this game when it was on beta in the summer of 2014 and i saw a lot of improvements,not to mention how awesome the car responds at all the commands.With that being,said i hope you enjoied my review and that i have opened your eyes about this game a bit and that maybe you will buy it and we'll play togather ! :D (sorry for wrong spelled words,i'm not native english)			"

												I don't think this game deserves that much negative criticism, I really like it, it's one of the only games of this type. The problem is Ubisoft's dodgy practice. The game has 1 expansion pack (at time of writing) and a few more DLCs. I own the very basic version, no expansion, no DLC and I can say that the after-game content is pretty lacking, all that is left to do is re-do some story missions to get better parts, do faction missions, PvP and that's about it without the expansion.Update: So as you may know, the Calling All Units expansion has been released and everyone gets something. Level cap has been increased to 60, performance cap has been increased to 1497, there are now more events to do, specifically crate runs. A nice addition is the fragment system, you need to get 10 fragments to unlock a car, you can get them from doing the crate runs. Platinum crates have a 100% chance of dropping a fragment.			"

 This game will annoy you and hit every single nerve. You have been warned. For easily driving around with all freedom in the world, this is it. For a realistic game get NFS.What I just said I did not just say lightly. I like this game, I do. But in the 5 hours I have played this game so far (In one sitting) I have been so insanely upset and happy at the same time, I still don't know what to feel.You might ask now: What? How's that possible? Should I buy this now or na?Well, let me get to that for you now:If the game is on sale, YES. Get it. Own it. If not, then don't waste your money. (I paid 30€ for the Complete Edition and I do not regret it.)The first thing I can tell you is the handling is something you will HAVE to get used to. I played Need For Speed 2016 before this, so I was used to something more accurate. But the Handling in this game feels so heavy. Too heavy. But taking curves is fairiyl easy and makes fun.Offroad it is really easy to slide around corner and get overtaken by AI in every single race, but on the street it's much more difficult to steer. Irony, right?The handling in this game isn't great, that's obvious. But it's not the worst, either. After 5h I have gotten used to it and no longer get upset because of it. I'm sure if you get into the game even more you won't even notice it. It sure as hell doesn't make the whole game bad though.Depending on what vehicle you use, the handling should change, but it doesn't really. Even lighter cars still feel heavy. Bikes on the other hand feel much more comfortable and I actually prefer riding them.The drifting is great though, offroad and on the street. No arguments.Like I said, I played NFS2016 before this, and I can tell you something now.If you want a realistic racing game, that challenges you in every turn, is accurate with every car and requires skill and thought, get NFS. It's not just the realistic graphics and models, but the insanely good handling and difference with every car. It requires you to sit down and study it. It's Need for Speed. There's not much more to say, I loved it. The Crew on the other hand is different.It's not as realistic, the graphics are lower and the handling is a lot different. So, why should I even consider The Crew over NFS? Both MP and SP and both racing games.Well, no. NFS is good, really good. But like I said, it needs time and liking and skill. It's not something for everyone.While with The Crew you don't need to worry about your Computer Specs or low framerate. No need to study the game and learn how to drive every corner. Also; you can specialize on off-Road or Dragrace or whatever.In NFS, you can't. I like the Crew because it's a game for everyone. You can costumize your cars to whatever your prefered style is:Dragrace, Drifting, Performance, Street, Offroad, Monster Trucks, etc. In NFS, it's just street racing. But it's perfect. You see?Need for Speed is the ultimate Racing game because all you do is Race.In The Crew you do much more. You can specialize your vehicles and try different kinds of races, different spcialized enemies and upgrade them accordingly.The little challenges on your way help you improve your Parts and even get your amazing stuff for finishing it. Whenever you ride a road with a challenge twice, you always do the challenge. No matter what.NFS's tuning is detailed and thought through. You gotta see what parts fit and earn them.In The Crew you literally get them thrown in behind you. They fit your vehicle.And this is great. You can level easily and get good parts without having to win any races. Now, Pro's and Con's:Pro:- Huge World- Specialized Vehicle Costumization- A lot of Vehicles- Bikes- Easy to get into- A lot of small & big things to do- The sounds are actually good and don't cause earcancerCon's:- Not too good graphics- The god damn handling- AI- AI- AI- Did I mention AI?Now, AI. Yes, yes, yes. I HATE IT. Why? let me explain to you, my friend.So, in the beginning I chose wisely what veicle I chose and what parts, coming from NFS and all. I was always high in points than my opponents. My car was much more advanced. I did so to win easily, of course.But the AI didn't care. My car: 210 Street level. Theirs: 150. AND YET I ATE THEIR DUST. Seriously, at level 20 you can have the best gear, the AI can be low, you will have to play multiple times a single god damn race because the AI just takes off, and you start with no Nitro and they do.Plus, the traffic AI seems to be out for you, always stopping for the enemy AI, but never for you.There is this one Offroad race that I had to play 7 times, because the Mini copper had infinite Nitro and just blasted away. Had to hit him into a tree to win. #Tactics. And that shouldn't happen. The game can be so frustrating, it's annoying. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it really gets on your nerve.Oh, you need to hunt down a car? Here, let me change lanes from the left to the right without indicators, so I drive right into you. Aw, that car is almost down with 20sec to go? Let me give it infinite nitro so you won't be able to catch up.Yes, the ""ram this vehicle to kill it"" missions are unfair as ♥♥♥♥, because they are always faster than you A lot. I had to learn their route to get them. #TacticsNr.2But despite all of that, I worked through it and I have to say: This game is good.Not the ""YOU GOTTA GET THEM ALL""-kinda good, but it's good. You can play it.Getting the entire game, plus Season Pass + ALL DLC' for 30€ was a really good deal. But I wouldn't pay more for this game.Ending:This is a good racing game with specialized cars and certain terrainracing for everyone. It's simple to mod and easy to get parts. The graphics are alright, but at least it works smooth on medium PC's. MultiPlayer is great, but no worries, Singleplayer is a lot of fun, too. For a -once-in-a-while-online-racing-game where you don't have to put a lot of time in, it is amazing.For a NFS-like racing game, it's not. If you see something challenging and realistic, not annoying, buy NFS 2016.If you just wanna drive around, offroad, drag, drifting, get this. The Crew.  8.7/10And watch out for that grey van.

												If you are looking for a solid multiplayer experience with your friends, do not buy this game. At the moment, the multiplayer aspect of the game barely works, and ironically, forming a crew with your friends is nigh on impossible. The singleplayer is solid enough, though gathering enough cash to buy new cars is a bit tedious. Edit: As of now, the multiplayer does seem functional enough for me to edit this review. While I cannot speak for the crew aspect (since none of my friends are interested in reinstalling the game so I can test it), PvP does seem to work fairly well for the moment. However, I was disappointed in the lack of variety in some PvP races; most notably in the Perf spec races. There is only one viable car to race with, the LaFerrari, forget trying to race with anything else because you will with most certainty lose.In the Street spec the Skyline is heavily favored, though it hardly matters what car you pick since most are fairly competitive. Sadly it is a spec that people rarely want to race with.As for Dirt spec races the Skyline is again favored by most players, though a skilled player should be able to stay with the pack in pretty much any car, granted it has all platinum parts installed.Raid is my favorite spec, but only because most cars in that class appear to be relatively balanced. What car you choose to race with appears to matter the least in this specific spec. As long as the car you choose has all platinum parts, you should be just fine with pretty much anything.And finally we come to the Circuit spec, and here the car does matter. From what I have seen you have three options in this spec. The Circuit Hotrod, the DLC Cadillac Escalade (I wish that was a joke) and finally the Alfa Romeo Competizione. The Hotrod is free, so that is what I recommend you get. When in a PvP lobby, expect to play a lot of Circuit and Perf spec races since these appear to be the most popular. And maybe once in a blue moon, you'll get to play a Street spec race.			"

												I was surprised at some of the car choices they had available, and then some of the cars they left out, but overall, this is truely a petrol head's MMO. I suspect they will be releasing DLC for more cars, considering they left out anything from Hennesy, Ferrari, Maserati, Bugatti and some legendary classics such as the Lambo Contach and Diablo.The late and great Mr. Shelby is represented well as his last creation is probably one of the meanest cars available for it's specialization.There's is a little something for every type of racer, Rally(Dirt), Street, Circuit(Traditional Races), Baja(Raid), then your borderline street legals (Perf). And all customizable according to the cars specs.Cars range from the 67 Mustangs, 69 Camaros and 70's Chargers to your top end cars like Pagani, Lamborghini, Luxury Sports such as the Mercedes SLS AMGs and BMW M series even the Bentley S along with a little everything in between.The driving simulation leaves a little to be desired, but with so much to do in the game you will barely notice it.The Downfall to this game... Ford Explorers. They are everywhere and ready to screw you over on the turns that matter, the skills that you need gold or plat completion on for that car part you need, or in general they're just brake checking you while you're going 300 miles in your Dodge Viper SRT 10 fit for circuit racing and when you adjust to avoid, they'll be sure to change lanes into oncomming traffic so you rear end them. Also, the game unnaturally pulls you from your direction of travel at times and you need to compensate for that, which can mean over compensation and ruining your run. Public enemy #1 is still those damn Explorers.Overall 9/10			"

												Medicore racing game filled with low poly traffic, lame♥♥♥♥♥races, untextured roads, and horrible AI.Needless to say, this would be impressive if it had come out in 2005. It manages to take the multiplayer concepts of Burnout Paradise and remove all the fun.Don't even get me started on the ""police chases"", what you think would be the best part of the game is actually the worst. If you think that you'll have a fun time driving up and down the US with your buddies while the cops are after you, go play an NFS title. All police chases in this game end the same way, the cops pull out infront of you, insta-stop and insta-bust you. Rinse and repeat.Awful excuse of a racing game, simply horrible. I'm sure there are better tagents and rants out there and I'm only touching on a few minor things that really ruined the game for me.The ""beta"" was also a great way to generate hype while the devs did nothing. Highlighted by their lack of fixing the roads and other odd glitches. (Flying off the map, cops teleporting around, traffic not navigating correctly, etc)Beta

												I'm 50/50 on this game. Its not bad, but its not great. The story is boring, the characters have no development and once you're done with the story you're just in freemode with not a whole lot to do. With this calling all units dlc, it gets really annoying to play. You have zoe every three minutes or so say 'Dont forget to check out the shop, you have a FREE car waiting.' The thing with the free car is in order to get it you have to buy the dlc. So if you dont have the dlc then you're stuck with zoe saying the same thing over and over again. Almost forgot to mention that when I opened up the game, it said something like 'Congrats you have unlocked the Nissan GTR, in order to drive it you have to buy the dlc' Yeah well ♥♥♥♥ you people. Dont say I unlocked something when I didnt.			"

												So, The Crew:Basically they took the idea of NFS Rivals and improved it, added a storyline, and optimized it better. The idea is that the game is always online. Any time you play it you will be able to see other people and even CO-OP with them. So is it better than NFS Rivals? Two words: Hell yes! It is better optimized for the PC, more customzation, and it has an actual story line. Some people are complaining that the map is not big enough. Well think about it - Fitting thousnds of miles/kilometers of roads and hundreds of cities into a game is pretty damn hard. Not to mention that if they did so, you'll probably get a game that will weigh over 100 GB's, and probably won't run on most PC's. So they took the best of what there is, and put it in the game. My only complain is that the game lacks some cars, for exmaple: Subaru Impreza WRX STI, or Toyota Supra. I expected to have those cars in a street racing game. I truely hope they add these cars sometime.And another thing, and this is aimed towards people, not the game itself: You complain about unrealistic physics in an ARCADE RACING game?! Are you serious?! An Arcade Racing game is supposed to have unrealstic physics. If you're looking for sims: Go for something like Assetto Corsa. Because this is not a Sim. This is an ARCADE RACING game.			"

												Positives and negatives listed below for your convinence.   The crew is a racing game that is fun to play with or against random players or friends of up to 8 players. The game offers the map of the united states in a miniscale version with open world driving of races from street cars, performance, circuits, or dirt. This isn't Test drive unlimited 3 so I will not compare it to 2 and there are certain strengths this game has and certain things it needs to work on so don't pass up on it since it is fun to play. (working on review video) and the list is a work in progress as I play the game since I am not done with this list. By the way if you're one of the♥♥♥♥♥that is messaging your friend to downvote the review for your own obnoxious trolling and agenda, I will let you know now that since this is a work in progress you're wasting your time with the thumbs down and I know who you are  since you've made it blatantly obvious and  I delete and reput up every update I make as I play the game and I am sick of steam not taking action against thisAlso my reviews are final form done in video format from now on, thanks. My reviews are done about the game, not to tell you to buy it, or even that its the best game in the world nor am I payed to do this or to forcing you to buy it. I gave it a thumbs up because I had fun playing it for over 50 hours with friends and players online alike. Its to give you an insight to see if you want to buy it and play it or not.This review system needs a better moderation seriously. Pros+ Better off racing with a pad or a wheel(needs adjustment)and not keyboard, it is possible but best on either these 2 though the wheel will require a bit of adjusting in the options.+ This game is far more optimized than Assassin's creed unity and Farcry 4 + Decently good  graphics with Msaa settings cranked up if you can handle it, not the best but good.+ The story was decent, about 10+ hours, Revenge story what else can they do.+ 60 FPS gameplay is fast and furious+ Certain cars can be customized with kits. Street, Dirt, Performance, raid, and circuit spec for racing which is the type of spec you race at for specific regions of the united states, they seperated it into 5 different sections.+ The world map environment is  detailed there is so many things happening if you park your car and look around, Animals running by, Airplanes soaring past, and people walking along the streets. The immersive environment is fantastic.+ The skybox looks great as night and day cycle and depending on where you are located you'll see stars, the moon etc that looks aesthetically pleasing.+ Every car has its own interior and looks very nice and authentic though some parts aren't too great such as the dash widgets itself.+ Miniscale version of the u.s to drive and explore Many landmarks, events trials throughout the united states to compete in and rank the leaderboards and statistics.+ Handling choices such as sport, all assist, and hardcore, choose your own handling style and level.+ Cars upgrades as you do the trials and story mode to get the parts.+ You can buy the cars with CC if you don't feel like earning game cash to unlock it or you can earn game cash to unlock it,  You still have to earn the parts for the car via skills Trials etc. So your car is worthless without these trials done to earn the gear for it for it to drive faster and handle better etc.+ Drive all over the place using fast travel or just drive for your own entertainment, Day and night cycle occurs.+ Most importantly, with friends or even a crew of people to race around with this game is FUN+ MASSIVE CROSS COUNTRY RACE,JUST RACED FOR 2 hours in ONE race WOW!+ PVP and Coop Mode.+ Very competitive leaderboard system and trials. cons- The racing rules in this game is basically, if you lead first for a few hundred yds and do really well, noone can really beat you. The only way to win is to make a mistake at traffic or a collision turn, No matter how clean and how well you drive you'll just get outranked. There should be a system in place for those that drive clean instead of being the overpowered cars.- Not really a social mmo- Factions war online is pointless noone plays it- Car balance needs work- Online only game, Meaning your saves are online and everything else, when servers are down so is your game which sucks no offline mode at ALL!- The coop is lonely and not everyone accepts to help out the storyline, you can only invite friends but when it comes to randoms invite noone wants to really accept it and the chatbox feels lonely. Restricted to 8 players.- Engines in this game sounds bad.- Its a miniscale u.s many towns and city missing still as they add in more, so can be inaccurate and some people might not see things they want.- Limited Cars- No rear view mirror and side mirrors working. They really need to implement this- Need a better system in knowing who is racing in certain pvp lobbies across the u.s cities since its pretty massive and queing is all over the place, also finding the right quest for the pieces you need could be quite a mess- Lack of dynamic weather effects, Only snow in mountain.- Nice damage on car physics but it heals itself up like magic, ruins immersion- Hitting animals or people and they'll instantly dodge you like magic, some people may see this as very immersion breaking.- The game is about cars + parts, the better the car + parts the better you are at pvping other people basically racing against them. If you don't have a top gear car in races with level, then you will most likely get beaten. Topping out car specs and level is important to winning this makes the balance in pvp a bit unfair especially when a 500 level car will vs a 1200 rank car etc.- The radio music is very limited and just isn't great, I shut off the radio and play my own track the s, The soundtrack for the story though is great- Microtransactions to unlock cars defeats the purpose of challenge.- Cross country Ai are horrible. Others and or changes via patch+-- Constantly repeating the same trial just to get the best + parts can get really daunting. The good news is you can BUY THEM once you unlock them at the garage+- Server situations is more stable now+- If you are impatient you can pay for in game cars and aesthetics but rest assured, THIS IS NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME AND EVERYTHING CAN BE EARNED EASILY just pvping and doing trials etc for cash.+- Once again this game is created by IVORY TOWER and PUBLISHED by UBISOFT. Get the facts straight please and stop hating.+- Your money your cash, buy the game now or wait for price drop.			"

												My experience so far is that while still a fun game it seems that everything done with the cars is done wrong. When I played the beta I just kept telling myself ""it's just a beta."" Boy was I wrong. Let tell you of my frustrations as well as what needs to be updated. -The car selection seems like someone obsessed with American muscle as well as DuPont catalogs. I don't want to street race in Ferrari and koinsegg (spelling). While I understand a few of these cars in the game it seems stupid for half the roster of a street racing game to be these kinds of cars. And there are 2-3 versions of old and new muscle. We have about 3-4 actual tuners to play with. Who made this car selection?-Pre-order bonus. Well I pre ordered the game for the Mini Cooper personally. Because I own one in real life. Was horrified to see that the pre order cars can only be used in street spec. Making them utterly useless. -The specs oh oh the specs. Advertised your game to be able to switch out specs on our cars on the fly for different race types. Reality sets in when you realize only a handful of starter cars can do every spec as well as only 1 truck having dirt spec. I'll say that last part again, only ONE truck in the game has dirt spec. Even the Hummer doesn't have a dirt spec. Once again WHAT WERE YOU THINKING. Is this a bug?!!!!! -Customization. If you thought the crew was gonna have the best customization since need for speed underground, then you better go back to your ps2. Customization is nonexistant. Besides a decent variety of paint and rims that's about it. Roughly 4 bumpers which are really just variations of the first 2, no trim paint options, no sticker color options, no painting of rims, no underglow, no ride height, no anything really. Watching your car be pulled apart while you customize it is merely a visual to make you think you have options. When in reality it needs some major work. Once again I will say this isn't a terrible game as the map was done really well and the game play is fun. But this is a story line based on street racing games and there isn't much street racing in the vehicles. Failed to capture that culture making it sub par in the end. So many details missed and little to no focus on the cars. Already the season pass promising more half million dollar cars instead of cars we asked for that are commonly found in street racing. I would rather see generic copy cats like the rx7, honda civic, Subaru sti and so on then have named car brands of crap nobody wants to use. You only need 1 mustang in a game not 15 versions of it.

												First thing I have to say before I write this review is : NO, it's not that annoying as everybody says about DLC's. It's not true, it never bothered me while playing the game. This game, is one of the best racing experiencies I've ever had. It's very, but very realistic when talking about driving behaviour, drifting, skidding on snow, driving on dirt and so on. I have to say, crashing into something isn't that realistic, but still gives you a pretty nice looking damage to car (but won't influence the behaviour of a car).Pros: This is the biggest open map game I have ever played. I mean, I spent around 17 hours driving and racing, and yet, not even 40% of map is discovered. Driving is just a pleasure, it's a lovely thing to do. What I enjoyed the most was driving on snow with a performance car. I mean, seriously, there isn't a better thing to do. This game gives you driving experience on dirt, snow, roads, off-roads, mountains and I mean everywhere where you possibly can be driving. Cons: Like I said, it doesn't really support any crash-hitboxes or anything like that. It's not a race simulator like Asetto Corsa or Project Cars. I don't put here as a con thing about DLC's, it's not that annoying at all, didn't bother me for a second.To sum it up:If you're looking for a car game with huge open-world map, possibility to tune and customize your cars and having fun just by driving from point A to point B, get this game! You won't regret a single dollar you spent on this game. 9,5/10			"

												Keep in mind: I rarely, very rarely, ever dislike a game. I don't even think bad rats is that bad, even with all of it's weird 2d-but-with-z-axis-inconsistent-physics. All I wanted was an open world racing game, much like Burnout Paradise. I can't even fathom why they published this. • The ground is made of ice• The cars are made of styrofoam• Every little bit of audio is muffled• Hitting anything or even trying to turn the car slightly turns you into a ♥♥♥♥ing tornado• Cars going in a straight line is physically impossible• You'll spend half of your play time fiddling with the handling options• Cars act as though they just have one, gyroscopical wheel in the center, instead of one regular wheel on all four corners• The pedestrians, which serve no purpose to begin with, are made out of wax, and teleport out of the way• Instead of crashes tearing your car apart, particles that could make up an entire other car are emited out of thin air• The people online are either five-year-old-glue-sniffers, or they see no reason to play this game other than to ram into the front of my car while I'm in the options menu. If it's the latter, I don't blame themIt's like this is a college student's game design thesis made in unity. I paid $50 for this ON SALE from giftcards, selling trading cards, and going through the headache that is Paypal to Steam. I could have spent that money on getting 10 really good games that I would have never played. Most of Ubisoft's games get flack for being unoptimised, yet I still enjoy it. This is the complete opposite: It's fairly optimised, but my god do I cringe when trying to even remotely enjoy it.I'll probably still play through this just because of how much I spent on it.

												As a causal driver not a big racing game fan, the Crew suits me well.The game engine seems not advanced, even a little bit outdated at your first look, but I'm just in love with this good old classic atmosphere, because the view, the building, the land describing are actually realistic. Beside, the CREW dev TEAM have made a big improvement on this game after the wild run and the call all units pack, the game's view is really getting better and better like the lighting, now there are huge differences compares to the original release version, which really seems dark and dull, but now I feel like it could catch up with the Horizon 3, which I don't feel like to play anymore, because the CREW has better atmosphere for casual drive.I really recommend you guys try to run it in 1440P,32 inch screen, you will feel much MUCH immersed and much detailed than in 1080P. For 1440P you just need a RX480 4G and a desktop i5 CPU, you will get 60fps at high settings most of the time. If have connecting issue, a VPN is recommended.This game is quite unique, you cant find any other game that cover the whole america. I could drive or wonder as far as I like, just to see the view, feeling relaxed. Once I all most cry in the the snow-covered mountain land cause the view is so breath-taking. At last I really hope Ubisoft can make a Chinese Version like those newly released Ubisoft games, excellent game like this should be known and enjoyed by more people.			"

Я не помню, чтобы мне хотелось одновременно крыть игру всеми тяжкими, борясь с желанием из неё выйти и вернуть обратно деньги, потраченные на покупку, и одновременно хвалить игру, восхищаясь тем, чего в других играх ещё нет. Здесь на любой плюс гарантировано есть минус, если не три. Так что же заставляет меня рекомендовать эту игру? И кому её рекомендовать? Давайте разбираться. Во-первых, я рекомендую игру только таким же психам как я. То есть тем людям, которые готовы ехать вперёд. Долго и беспощадно. Не размениваясь на гонки, на лиги и дивизионы, на сотни безликих улучшений характерных для рогалика, но не для симулятора. Не застревая в дебрях худших интерфейсов игровой индустрии, но наслаждаясь спидометром, часами асфальта и порой удивительно красивыми видами. Не прося у игры быть игрой с большой буквой «И». Последнее умение большая редкость.Во-вторых. Я не рекомендую эту игру тем, кто ожидает от неё детализации GTAV, детализированных машин, корректного поведения их на дороге, хорошей физики, в том числе и физики разрушения последних упомянутых. В этой игре нереально многое. Гладкое полотно мира, где редко срабатывает подвеска, потому что колдобин, ухабов и других особенностей рельефа просто нет. Это мир призраков, где вы никогда не задавите перебегающее дорогу животное, потому что оно неосязаемо.  Это мир кирпичей, где вы никогда не разобьете машину, потому что это невозможно и где разбитая машина никогда не будет влиять на манеру езды. Это мир клонированных построек, где одну и туже закусочную вы увидите не один десяток раз. Это мир клонов, ибо машины трафика вокруг - копии друг друга. Они не имеют разных цветов, половых отличий и признаков. Это мир где ударившись о другую машину вы как ни в чём не бывало продолжаете ехать дальше. И это мир где будучи в одной сессии с другом вы можете его и не увидеть. Просто потому, что это игра про гонки с друзьями. Смекаете? Так какого же черта обзор «пальцем вверх деланный»?Эта история началась в Нью-Йорке, когда два раздолбая достигли 10 уровня. Это было уже после двух часов игры и продирания через дебри интерфейса, слёз и непонимания. На наших внутри игровых счетах образовалась круглая сумма в размере 100К. В отдельной спец-валюте. И вот здесь и началось что-то непонятное. Здесь игра вдруг стала другой. У дилеров оказались разные ассортименты. Я смог купить Dodge 1969 года, а он… и я тогда ещё не знал об этом (а ассортимент для каждого игрока в один момент времени - разный) Chevy Impala. Два масл-кара, которые встретившись вместе собрались пересечь Америку от восточного побережья до западного. Чтобы это случилось так, как случилось - мы послали к дьяволу игру отключив все возможные интерфейсы и клятвенно пообещали не открывать карту, руководствуясь лишь собственными географическими познаниями. Четыре часа мы не могли достичь желанной точки. Останавливаясь в отелях и заправляясь на бензоколонках (понарошку конечно). Приключение заняло три дня и две ночи по местному времени. Мы выехали из Нью-Йорка и описав петлю попали в него же. Проскочив Сент-Луис чуть не задели Канзас и «рухнули» в Большой Каньон. Его я вспоминаю с ужасом. Ещё ни в одной игре, кроме я не ехал столь долго. Он действительно велик. Не заезжая в Лас-Вегас (а зря!) мы забурились в Скалистые Горы и они полностью сломали нам ощущение ориентации в пространстве. Дорожный серпантин, определенно, меняет восприятие реальности. В совокупности с ночью это помогло нам проскочить Лос-Анджелес и потом полчаса гнать рядом со стеной… и, слава богу, что мозг таки сработал (что характерно не мой) и мы наконец осознали, что это великая мексиканская стена. Порой картинка была уныла, но чаще она подкидывала весьма красивые пейзажи, поражая размером. Его хотелось бы заполнить многим. Необходимостью заправляться есть и выполнять курьерские миссии, разумеется выходить из машины и бить живых мертвецов по башке разными подручными средствами. Спасать прекрасных дам и пить за здоровье спасенных за игрой в покер или кости, прожигая кровно заработанные в клубах сигаретного дыма и запахе старого дерева. Всё это было бы очень здорово… и очень хочется... но не в нашей жизни ребят. Вероятно детки наши такое увидят. Чтобы и размер был ого-го, и качество сервиса. Будь это GTAV, да с таким, мать его, причиндалом... но нет. Увы. Проработать ""по рокстаровски"" мир такого масштаба на данный момент невозможно. Если ничего из перечисленного нет, то почему рекомендация к покупке?Аркадная игра от подарила нам удивительный рпг опыт. Такой мне не давала ещё ни одна игра на этой планете. И должен сказать вам – иногда размер имеет значение. Вряд ли подобное повторится. Но я благодарен уже за то, что это было. И я очень люблю игры, которые позволяют мне там играть так как я хочу. По-своему. Я с трудом могу рекомендовать эту игру нормальными игрокам, но психам… ребятки – добро пожаловать. Всем остальным – в сад. Не потому что тут царство эстетов. Нет. Игра действительно спорная. И я никому её не хочу рекомендовать. Просто делюсь впечатлениями. И рассказываю, как всё происходило. Выбор всегда за вами за вами. Но… если вдруг сделаете это, не приходите и не кройте меня на чём свет стоит. Вас за выхлопную никто не тянул.P.S.Карта которая покажет наш путь куда лучше чем слова.

												In General The Crew is a baby of Test Drive and Driver : San Francisco with a little touch of NFS seriesThe game have all the Digital Petrol Head wants fast cars stunning views and twisty mountain roads and ofc. Bonneville flats, the game world feels crowded and alive from bison packs running across the roads wolfs and bears lurking in the woods. One of the strong points of the game is the freedom and open world saw something interesting at the horizon you actually can go there. you can drive there on the road in you Street spec car or switch to something off rowdy and go in straight line trough woods and over the mountains. Every car got its own feel to it they all handle differently, from straight line muscles to agile japan tuner cars, and the crew brigs it back you love a car A here take it drive it, your car A is short on power and cant outrun a faster cars here put some power in it, oh you don't like the stock looks no problem in that compartment either.Not like allot of other driving series oh you Hate car X! Here drive it!!!! , Oh you love your car A sure drive it but only until you progress and then you will have to drive car X!game puts decision back in gamer hands i love car A i drive it, not like the other games you have to drive cars XYZthe Handling model cant say is brilliant but its fun, its somewhere in between arcade and simulator.From me Game gets solid 8,4/10 but its score for the beta. But definitely see you on the road.			"

												I bought this game on release (no pre-order) and played it for a week and had to stop because my laptop couldn't handle the detail in the game. It let me play it but fps would drop frequently. Fast foward to 2016 and a used gaming pc running GTX 550I and i got NO ISSUES with the game.Ever since I began playing it on a desktop computer with a real graphics card i haven't had time to play anything else let alone watch some anime. Ended up completing the campeign within 2 weeks durring my free time and i must say i love it! I even bought a xbox one controller with usb cord to play the game--and it plays superb with the controller. The wheel has mixed reviews but its not for everyone, i know that sometime this year i will for sure buy a wheel/peddle combo for this game.The custimization of the cars is handled well withe the fact that when you make it to level 50, you gain the opportunity to earn more custimzation such as more front bumpers or more rims.PVP is fun as well however if one player has bad internet connection it will interupt the game for a few seconds only as the match reconnects everyone.I do not ( i have googlefiber) so I always hope that whenever i enter pvp lobby that everyone has decent internet.Now that my storyline is done i had a day where i wasn't sure what to do but then i remembered the wild run expansion and the endless possiblities (until this time i had focused on campeign) and now im pumped again!The updated graphics were a must for the game and now that they have done that  i do say all the landscape looks amazing! I'm getting the Wild run expansion and i can't wait to drive a monster trick up the side of a mountain or thru las vegas :PEver since i finished the campeign i have been planning on what story to write as i continue to play 'The Crew'. Whatever story i choose to write and drive thru i will sure as hell have hours upon hours of fun!Who knows maybe if i end up driving and writing the story i might publish it as a fanfic :P but thats months away i bet!Conclusion:The crew was good at release but since the Wild Run Expansion and upgradted graphics mainly, it has gotten far better than I could have imagined. Granted there are still some hiccups such as the pvp lobby intrupting gameplay (pausing it for 5 seconds) if a player has pretty bad internet connection. Otherwise they have worked hard on improving the game since release. An Xbox One Controller works great with the game and i can't imagine myself playing it on a keybored ever again! (unless i didn't have access to a controller!)Even though on steam this game has alot of mixed reviews i hope we as a gaming community can give this game the support it could use to really inspire the developers to greater hights with this game. The potential of it is without limits. Let's hope they never stop adding to this wonderful game.oh yeah, and its fun! "

												The Crew, was a game i waited for since the development started, i love car games, car customization, and i love open world. The crew has all of them.  Need For Speed Underground 2 & Most wanted 2005, started my ""liking"" for car games. I loved customizing a car, making it my own. I love drifting, and i love having no limits. The only thing that is negative in the crew is the money situation.Overall, The Crew is a fun game for car enthusiasts. If you dont like cars, i cant make the choice for you, but i still do recommend it :3			"

												Idea was quite exciting until I play the game for the frst time. The looks checks out, the story and the mission/car development structure has potential, but game physics & mechanics are so poor, I almost felt like I'm playing test drive 25 years ago. Unfortunate they didn't nail the driving experience, because without it, a racing game (no matter even if it's an mmo) does not worth to be played. "

												Can not recommend this game to any new players at all. There are so many issues, bugs and crash problems with this game that Ubisoft has acknowledged and refuses to fix. For more than a year these issues have persisted, you can even youtube these problems with keywords as "" The Crew terrain bug "".Ubisoft has not shown any support in fixing these problems for the duration of the year despite the community having upwards of 40+ pages on both the Steam forum and the Ubisoft The Crew forum. There support consists of "" Please give us more information about the crash so we can help fix it "" while doing nothing.The Crew has some of the worst finicky hardware related issues I have seen in a game in my time, you can deck yourself out with the greatest hardware and still have problems, or you can have average to low and have little problems and then vice versa again.The Crew is a beautiful looking game for it's release date, platforms and multiplayer capacity, I have enjoyed many hours driving around the "" virtual usa "" map which is not 100% accurate, probably not even 60%, but it has it's moments driving passed landmarks, or through new york city for example. On ultra settings the game will definitely impress for visuals and excitement. Plently of entertainment driving around completing missions or cruising with friends, performing co-op missions, on that note though, you must be aware that anyone in the world can and will affect your gameplay experience. You are not really 'locked' behind a security blanket in The Crew, your missions can be interupted by other players which will effect your personal experience, due to a lack of any form of moderation or adminship in the game, trolling others is not at all against the rules. Blocking entrances, ends of races, race markers, anything goes.The Crew's over all performance for game play is a fun and enjoyable experience, if you can enjoy it that is. With constant crashes and terrain issues, or game freezes it becomes a frustrating mess at times. If you're willing to give the game patience and grit your teeth through all it's cancer, you might be able to sit down and have a pretty good time, and godspeed to you.However, I must conclude with, the price of the game vs it's overall problems, is not worth the buy. Ubisoft shows no support or help / compensation for players so the price will never cover the frustration of it's downfalls. With a 2nd expansion in the works and issues still unresolved and full pricing for the expansion with no compensation for the previous owners who are not able to even load the game due to "" The Crew has stopped responding "" at startup, I can not give this game a passing score. It is a flop, a fail, a miserable purchase and a game that gets shelfed quickly soon after your bad experiences become more infuriating then attempting to load the game time and time again.TLDR:  Ubisoft doesn't support it, it's priced heavily for a broken game.2/10, do not recommend. Find another game.			"

												The game really isnt worth buying. At first the game was really fun and seem to have a lot of potential. once you hit the max level you can  pvp, do 1hour+ long faction missions and free roam. The faction missions aren't that fun to do and are basicly made pointless when you can easily send friends out to (not actual friends they send and ai) to do the faction mission for you. Pvp is ok but needs to have a lot more game modes. The free roam is fun but I end up driving in the same areas seeing as how most of the map is either highways or ai filled citys. The offroading is a lot more fun than the on road seeing as how you can either go onto the dirt roads or make your own ""roads"" with the raids spec. One issue with the game is that getting any car in the game is as easy as just farming a few pvp missions or sending friends on faction missions, even getting the hidden cars isn't satisfying at all.  Another issue is that the so called fixes they have implemented into the game dont seem to fix much, a lot of the performance improvements to some of the rear wheel drive cars dont actually improve anything. Car customization is great and all but what I would rather have is a system more like forza horizon 2 where I can swap engines, buy diffrent parts for the car, body parts that actually affect the performance instead of just looking cool. The games car progression system compared to horizons is very dull, all you do is find a few jump challenges that are easy to do with the car you are using and just sit there farming for a few hours till you have a max level car. I am going to end here, there is a lot more I could talk about but this review is already long.tl;dr: The game is fun but lacks in certain game mechanics. Its also very boring once you realise how easy it is to get the most expensive car. patchs dont fix much.If you want something better save your money and buy something more along the lines of project cars or if you own an xbox buy horizon 2 there is a larger car selection and you can properly tune cars. Although I did have fun with the game I would much rather have horizon 2 where I can basicly tune the tyres, gearing, springs, damping and all that good stuff. Again there are more things I could talk about but I dont want to make this any longer than it is.Edit: Another issue that I really wanted to mention is the car variety is very little and the dlcs only add 3 cars each.

												If you enjoy racing games and not just racing Sims and you ever played MCO from EA and have always been looking for a replacement this is as close as there has been.The driving still needs some work cars float too much but overall the game will be a nice change from every other online game currently available.1/1/15 UpdateAfter spending quite a few hours learning and fine tuning a number of cars I've dicovered that the handling isn't as bad as I had previously assumed. Before I hadn't done much adjusting of the settings but now that I have I can deifnitely confirm the handling is fine just the defaut handling gets you off to a bad start.I now have a 1299 car of all but Raid spec which is much harder to grind the parts on. There are certian cars for certain races. Races in the Mountain range on snowy roads are better in a Ford Focus than a Ford Mustang.The game has alot going for it but they really need to work on expanding the Map maybe DLC's that add more cities into the map would be a quality start. They really need to work hard on more cars ASAP there are tons of cars that could be added to this game that would really give it a lot more life. Not everyone wants a Ferrari or Lamborghini and while the Koenigsegg Agera R is an awesome car it's just not realistic to use on a US map.Car models I'd love to see added to the game would be more upper class but not super cars. Lexus, Audi, Cadillac and Acura. There are just a lot of cars left out that the game really needs.I really enjoy the game and there is nothing that would make me quit playing it. Weekly missions in game need to happen more often and there should be some type of end game which right now the only end game is racing other players.			"

												Hmm, The Crew.This game received a lot of criticism at launch, and its not like it didn't deserve it; the game was lacking in a lot of aspects and had so much potential to be more than what it was.Fast forward to now when the Wild Run expansion has released and brought a slew of changes to the game visually and gameplay wise. I would actually recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the Test Drive Unlimited series which were also made by some of the developers of this game! If a huge map, exotic vehicles + customisation, and the freedom to drive around is what you want then this game has it all and plenty.I mostly played The Crew prior to the Wild Run update. It was actually a lot of fun going through the to be honest meh storyline, but that isn't what anyone bought this game for. The selling point was obviously the fact that the map is a scaled version of the United States, and good grief is it amazing.For what it is, it has plenty of detail (and now looks stunning as well thanks to the update) and nothing will beat the road trips you take solo or with friends, perhaps strangers on the road also playing their own game (so to speak because its a quick drop in/out lobby system for lack of a better phrase) between the various states. Putting my phone on a speaker dock next to me, setting up my Logitech DFGT, turning off the HUD, going to cockpit view and cruising along the freeways at night is just so wonderful I can't even describe it. And it's not short road trips either, getting across the states will take an actual hour or 2, maybe more, depending on the route. Super easy to lose time in this game like that.Speaking of, car physics. It's pretty arcadey, but everyone expected that (right?). They've definitely improved it since launch and its fine to play now for the most part IMHO.Customization is handled pretty well. The UI could with quality-of-life tweaks but the modding of each vehicle it self is pretty well fleshed out (looking at you, NFS 2015). Should be noted, that all the vehicles do not have all the specs available to them. You can imagine my disappointment to the lack of a raid Murcielago :( still, Fiat 500 Monster Truck.Music selection in this game is nice, didn't agree with a few songs but hey, I just play my own while playing now so. Car selection is also pretty good.I cannot speak much for the events and the Wild Run exclusive ""Summit"", but I hear good things. PVP races are prone to being glitchy occasionally (maybe they fixed this now, can't tell for sure) but they have definitely balanced the vehicles you can use for the races now as compared to pre-Wild Run (the LaFerrari was the go to car if you wanted any chance at winning for example in the Perf-spec), so thank you devs!So there you go, my thoughts on The Crew. Would 100% recommend if you love cruising around the USA.			"

												While the plot isn't the most realistic in how it works; the game itself provides a lot of missions and a huge map of America that never gets boring. This is a really fun game.			"

												Welp here is my kinda quick who gives a damn about spelling review on the crew, Even though everyone gave this game♥♥♥♥♥♥before it had even come out due to ubisoft and how they are but This is coming from someone who is max level and finished the story,Pros- The game looks really nice,cars are very nice to look at and sound very nice, the map feels very large and has lots of different terrain and weather which does effect the handling which is good. The story is rather enjoyable for a racing game and it is an adult level story not some dumbed down kids friendly story that makes me want to cry (Test Drive 2 im looking at you), The cars handle well for what they are and upgrading does actually make the cars feel better to drive.Cons- (ohboiherewego.jpg) Welp this game does have its fair share of cons so far. The whole name of the game is the crew, which is funny conisdering me and my friends cant join each others crews, and the fact most of the time you are playing you never see anyone else driving around, and teleporting to friends to see them doesnt help because they never show up on your screen. Another con would be the huge lack of support with these problems and how none of the devs seems to care about the connections problems (Which isnt good considering this game is apparently an mmo, and an mmo with connection issues isnt a good thing). The last few cons would be gameplay based, the other ai racers in this game are either so stupid they drive into rivers or they are so rediculously op that they cant be caught even by the best of drivers in the best of cars, and the last con would be im having a problem where the game seems to take control of the car and ♥♥♥♥ you up at the worst of times.Final thought: Even with this extensive amount of cons i would still reccommend this game as the majority of these cons will be fixed within the next few days (hopefully) and the game is rather enjoyable otherwise.

												The Crew is an okay game, it offers such a wide variety of feats. Skill challenges, Races in PvE and PvP and now including The Summit with stunts and freedrive challenges in it's latest expansion. In return however, the game has so many pet peeves that can bother a player to stop playing forever. Like a finish line delay that could lose you some seconds while playing with people outside your region, the ability to exploit some obstacles to gain seconds and a slightly messed up balance between vehicles. People hope for the best experience in every little aspect of the game, but The Crew is so massive that it can not offer this. As a result, The Crew does just about average in everything. You're not supposed to like The Crew because of sounds, amount of cars, customization, graphics or handling specifically. It expects you to like the wide selection of literally everything it has. Would it do better for players liking specific feats if the game chooses to minimize it's offers? Yes. You'll leave other people disappointed however. It's up to the developers to offer the best experience out of everything it has. You can see they 'slowly' improve on some stuff, but with each pro comes it's cons.I like The Crew because of it's variety and I try to look through the well-known pet peeves to enjoy an actual fun game. So far I think I'm doing a good job at it. I'm coming back to the game from time to time to see if anything new happened.Should you buy The Crew, the Season Pass, the Wild Run expansion or anything named together for the full price? No. Wait for a 50% discount. This will cause you less annoyance, but still have a jolly good time in a fun open-world racing game.			"

												The Crew features an open and persistent world for racing and free-roaming across a scaled-down recreation of the contiguous United States. The map is split into five regions: The Midwest, East Coast, Mountain States, West Coast, and The South. Each region has its own unique geographical features. Six main cities (one in each region, two in The Midwest) are featured in the game: Detroit and Chicago in the Midwest, New York City on the East Coast, Miami in The South, Las Vegas in the Mountain States, and Los Angeles on the West Coast. Various other cities, such as San Francisco, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Dallas, New Orleans, Washington D.C., and St. Louis, are also featured in the game. Over thirty smaller cities and towns line the countryside like Nashville, Norfolk and others. It takes approximately 45 minutes in real time to drive from coast to coast in-game. The single-player campaign is 20 hours long, and entails infiltrating criminal groups with protagonist Alex Taylor (Troy Baker). Players can also participate in mini-games called skills challenges that are peppered across the world. They are triggered when a player drives through them and it involves completing challenges such as weaving through gates and staying as close to a racing line as possible for a period of time. Players' scores are automatically saved so friends can try and beat their scores, in similar fashion to how Autolog works in games of the Need for Speed franchise. Missions can be played alone, with friends, or with online co-op matchmaking. The multiplayer mode lets a maximum of eight players to compete in races and other gametypes. There are no in-game loading screens or pauses.			"

												One of very few games I've returned/had $ refunded for.  Graphics are pretty good (8/10), from the single player storyline/plot/character interaction I experienced, I enjoyed it (not going to give a numeral rating as I experienced very little of this due to quickly refunding the game).  Unfortunately, the driving physics and controller (wheel) support is garbage.  I have a G27, I'm quite familiar with *it's* issues (such as the ~18-20% hardware deadzone on the wheel), but I've managed to get it working properly in all driving games I've played that can natively support the wheel.  Having said that, I spent ~2 hours tweaking the controls in this game, as well as pouring over forums about the 'best' setups for the G27 in the game, and I could never get these two aspects of the wheel behavior correct; steering 'weight' (any amount of weight on the wheel, just from your hands, is enough to move it around without turning up the force feedback, which then *kind* of gives it a proper feel.  its not just a 'centering' issue, i couldn't find a way to sustain 'weight' to the wheel, i'd constantly and seemingly randomly go 'slack' and not when the front wheels were off the ground or anything like that).  the other aspect is the 'arcadey' feel many other reviews here and posts online have detailed; it is just very hard to 'organically' control cars in this game with a wheel, its more of a 'black or white' 'left or right' 'straight or smashing into a wall' control.On top of the control issues, which definitely ruin what could be a phenomenal game, to me; there is the issue of the amazingly overaggressive and cheating AI - going ~180 in a 'street' upgraded mustang and the *normal* cop cars aren't having trouble catching up at all, in fact, they're so fast they'll actually surround you and start body slamming your vehicle.I should probably just stop buying any ubisoft games, they seem to all have a common theme; pretty good gfx + decent concept + horrifically ruined by not polishing the gameplay properly. = ubisoft games.If they ever fix the controls in the game, I'd *definitely* buy it; however, I doubt this will ever happen, I bought this in 2017, and these same exact complaints have existed in the community since its release at the end of 2014.

												Regarding The Crew is not a bad game, but ""Wild Run"" expansion is overrated and overpriced. What you really get is a few car specs and few events. And a motorcycles, yes. That's all. And this ""expansion"" claim price even higher than original game. Ubisoft is starting to be veeery greeedy. I don't want to play the game when I see such a ""future"". And I wouldn't recommend it to you either.			"

												+Amazing concept +drives well,+very fun+nice range of cars+Bikes (req Wild Run)+massive open world+Graphics+Drifting (Req Wild Run)+Drag racing (Req Wild Run)-Horrible support-Bugs that prevent you from playing-no recent hotfixesI'm hoping they pull their finger out and start patching up the game because with the latest arival Wild Run comes new bugs, the worst being is the world not loading up during an event and you get stuck solid you can reset ur car causing the loading to continue but by time you do that you're miles behind the race. tied with that is a forever stuck on loading screen unable to do anything so you have to ALT+F4 out I'm struggling to do the new events with a crew because of this.I really wanna recommend this but I can't. if bugs like what I mentioned doesn't bother you then do buy the game + expac. very good aside the bugs. But going to leave it on a negative rating.Ubisoft, sort it out...			"

Posted: January 21, 2015
												First of all I would like to start off by saying that I have played approximately 20 hours of the game.  This has basically put my most of the way through the campaign.  My background with the game started earlier this summer when I got invited into the closed beta.  (Played about 6-8 hours)  The very first problem with this game is that you can't just use steam, on top of steam you have to use UPlay(Only works about half the time and takes forever to get into the game)  The next problem is that once you get into the game (assuming you have an internet connection) it tends to be rather buggy.  There seems to be an issue with optimization because my computer is rather capable and more than meets the minimum and recommended specs.  As with most AAA titles lately if you have AMD hardware you definitely need to beware  (my laptop with Nvidia hardware runs the game much better)  The main problem seems to be around the cities(Lots of buildings and poor optimization).  All in all this fits together to be a rather poor title but the one thing that keeps nagging me is the physics of the game itself.  I could probably get past the online all the time (Wasn't explicitly stated that you have to be) or even the sometimes poor framerates.  But the poor and might I add inconsistent physics and handling between cars is terrible.  Now I can personally say that I have never driven most of the vehicles in-game, but last time I checked a 600-900 horse Ferrari should be able to drift much better than an off-road Chevy Silverado(Actually have driven this).  However this is not the case all the muscle cars that people have been sliding around for years and years are impossible to drift.  The only game mode that seems remotely realistic is that of circuit racing.  I wasn't expecting this to be Forza Motorsport realistic but I at least expected it to feel something like Dirt 3 or Grid (Something sim-cadeish).  Finnally about the physics we are looking at the terrible bug where sometimes you will be cruising along and hit the same curb or patch of dirt you have hit 100 times with no consequence and now all of a sudden you are tossed into the air and are placed miles behind your competitor.  All in all I am extremely dissapointed with the crew as I have been waiting for a U.S. playground for cars for years.  Guess I am still waiting.			"

I'm going to play the Forza Horizon 3 now, it's much better than this			"

												This is an amazing racing game. Huge open world, tons of races and hidden events to find, and an awesome customization system for your cars. The handling is a little weird and takes some time to get used to, but isn't bad at all. Imagine Burnout Paradise but with customization of cars. The map is so much fun to explore just beacause of the simple fact that you can just drive right off the road at any point and blaze your own path to the next goal/start point/car dealership/whatever you may be wanting to drive to. I feel this game will get a bad rap just because of the use of uPlay, but I will put up with uPlay anyday of the week to play this game, it's that good. I find myself forgetting what I am suppose to be driving to, and just driving around looking at the world change. It is also nice that it runs well (note that at this time I am writing this during the beta and the game is capped at 30fps. But no crashes or game breaking bugs). All in all, this game is really awesome. I have had a ton of fun in my first 10 hours and I can't wait to keep playing.			"

												It's an alright game, but nothing that was promised to us. I had fun with it, but I tought this will be ""THE"" game that I will play countless hours. But the p2p connection and all the failed atempts at fixing the netcode went wrong.Sadly it will never redeem itself without totally remaking the p2p system, the pvp and such. But for the money's worth, you get many hours of fun until you're doing the challenges, skills, missions, faction missions, getting parts and such. So I recommend it, even tough it didn't come out as ""THE"" game, but still an okay game nonetheless.			"

Posted: January 23, 2015
												After clocking in 36.1 hrs in this game. i have come to the conclusion that this is the first and LAST time i EVER buy a game from Ubisoft. This was a huge let down in many aspects. While i try my best to focus on the good of the game ( will be stated lower down), from time to time i find my self regretting the fact that i went against my instincts to not buy the game ( reason being deep down i felt like this game would be a total let down after ACU: Assasin creed Unity reviews).Pros( may or may not state all)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+Huge map+driving never really feels repetitive unless doing specific races+open world+fun skill challenges, races, and faction races+being able to make crews between friends and or people you don't know ( Chance to make friends online).+Earning money is not a struggle therefore buying cars aren't a headache-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons ( to many to list)-Crew are limited to only 4 people-very low car selection from since launch-Car modeling is sub par for a next gen game-Street cars and circuit cars have a fetish for driving offroad-when turning corners in any class of car, it feels like you're slamming the vehicle to the left/right-driving dirt cars feel like you're constantly drifiting on ice-not much to do with friends besides races, missions and more races just pvp this time-Story line is a little to predictable ( not a deal breaker)-driving against AI constantly feels like the game is trying to recreate a movie scene where the race ends in NECK&NECK-IF MY CAR HAS A RATING OF 900+ THERE IS NO REASON OR SENSE FOR AI CARS RATED AS 600 AND BELOW TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH ME.-Cop chases feel like you're car weighs 5 lbs and the cop cars have the wieght of an Airbus A380 jumbo Jet. when they hit you, you're car gains the speed of a bullet and goeing into the direction you're hit too, how ever when you hit the cop car that looks like it can be taken down easily, u still gain the speed of a bullet and fly into the opposite direction you hit the car into.-Cop cars that aren't exotic or have have the potential to go past 200MPH should NOT be keeping up with my Lambo. thats is Blazing by on the highway @ 245MPH. I swear, this game makes police chases feel as if some of the cop vehicles have magnetic propulsion systmes in them.-Graphics needs to be boosted up ( a bit apauling for a next gen game)i also felt like more effort were placed into using shaders and other techniques to mask the bad graphics.-For a game that has such a huge scale map, the entire world feels empty to some extent; eg: the only place civilians are prevalant are in medium to large cities in states such as like NY, LA and Illanois. And despite their presence in these locations, their numbers are outstandingly low leaving a feeling of deserted city with just civilian vehicles going in and out of.-THE DRIVING PHYSICS, HANDLING & everything else involved with the movement of cars are ABSOLUTLY APPAULING. ( driving games like NFS underground feels alot more bearable than this in my honest opinion. countless times while driving circuit cars, i begin to get the feeling like im driving my car on ice when moving at high speeds (it feels like im moving a lamborghini at rocket speeds on ice while trying to stare).-Accident situations are just wacky. by that i mean if i get careless while racing and make a mistake, and go offcourse i just have to hold B on the controller and i will respawn OR sometimes when im 150 mph+ & i am about to hit a tree or a car i sometimes just slide to the side like nothing was there. If im not lucky that happnes then i must endure a mandetory cutscene of my crash that sometimes happens in the wierdest ways. (cutscene can be skipped once 1 or 2 seconds have passed its bearable).-The speed of the cars are just all over the place. exotic cars can have the tendancy to bearly feel different ater leveling them up to 1299 ( max level ) in their respective classes ie street, dirt, raid & Circuit. for example. i bought a lamborghini Mercealago after spending some time doing races, the car top speed in full stock was 219MPH , currently i have leveled the car up to 1230, the max speed i have reached with this car is 249 MPH with NOZ blowing out the exhaust pipes like the mouth of a dragon.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are much more CONS, however you the reader should get an idea by now. In conclusion i felt completly let down by this game. i haven't bought a racing game since the new NFS most wanted was released in 2012. I Thought Ubisoft was going to really dilever on this game but i was WAY out of the ball park with my expectations. I was fooled by the CG Trailors of the game they were releasing to hype this game up. To me there is limited fun to have in this game so therefore i will not recommend this game to anyone as of this moment unless this game undergoes heavy amounts of fixing.			"

												Welp, since I have nothing to do today, might as well speak my mind on The Crew, which is something I have been intending to do for a while.This would also be my first serious and semi-long review, so enjoy.Ah, The Crew. I remember how hyped I was for it when I saw the first E3 announcement back in 2013. I thought ""Wow, this game looks perfect for me. Nice cars, huge map that is the entire U.S.A, seamless multiplayer, etc."" Long story short, by the time the game released in 2014, I had forgotten completely about it due to my addiction at the time called Team Fortress 2.Well, in early 2016, I bought The Crew, since I had nothing else to play and didn't want an Xbox One just to play Forza Horizon. I thought it could be a decent alternative, which, surprisingly, was a pretty okay alternative at the time. I actually had fun in The Crew, doing story missions and meeting new people to do them with was a nice experience. Building cars and leveling them up was also a much better experience than I thought it would be. Then why is it a bad game?The thing with The Crew is that it's not necessarily a bad game with a bad concept. Infact it had a TON of potential. A racing MMO is a cool concept, and The Crew was a good attempt at it (keyword: ""was""). I genuinely enjoyed playing through the story. But the thing is, once you beat it you realize there's nothing left, well, except for one thing. PvP. You try PvP races with your, uh... what's the performance measure called again? I don't know. Forgot. Let's just call it ""level"" for convenience's sake. You try PvP races with your level 900 Perf spec RUF, and realize that you are getting completely crushed by cars that are level 1299 (I think the new cap is 1399 though). You wonder what to do, and decide to look up some guides on the community hub. You find the car levelling guide, which tells you that you must farm late game skills (which are in the western side of the map) and eventually level your car to a competitive 1299 (or 1399). Once you get your car to the max level, you race, you win, and you repeat until you are swimming in cash. Once this happens, you suddenly realize that you are at the absolute end game, with literally nothing else to do, and you quit the game for good. But wait, what's this? An expansion pack? Maybe your journey actually isn't fi... HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥HOW MUCH FOR THAT EXPANSION?The absolute main problem with the game is that it is a HUGE COCKTEASE if you do not buy DLC. The game pushes to buy DLC, namely the expansion pack. Back when I was actively playing this game, the Wild Run expansion was its own thing, which the game advertised me to get nonstop (which I didn't, thankfully). The game constantly teases you with trials with loan cars that you can't own without the proper expansion pack. You will be inclined to get it, but don't, really. This is a Ubisoft game, people. They WANT you to buy as much DLC as you can. The DLCs usually hold very nice content locked behind a paywall, a big paywall that is. A paywall that is never worth it, not even on sale. I mean really? 40 bucks? Really not worth it. Not to mention microtransaction currencies too.By the way Ubi REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed people with the new Calling All Units expansion, but you can read other reviews on why that is, as I do not own the DLC.And to add more salt to the wound, in addition to the horrid DLC pricing, the game is plagued with metric ♥♥♥♥tons of bugs and issues, it's actually insane. For example, The digital displays in cars' interiors don't work, only the gauges do. That might be a small detail, but when you realize even games that aren't racing games, like GTA, have working digital displays, it comes as a real disappointment, and shows how lazy the devs are. They did this on the new cars too. Neither the GT-R nor Huracan have proper working displays. And that's just a basic issue with the game. There are so many game breaking bugs that I can't even start to mention, or else this review would be longer than the entire code of The Crew. Like really, would it have taken that much time to make it so there are more than 10 people at a time in a huge open world and that they don't constantly disconnect and lose each other?And after all that, they still gouge you till your wallet is completely empty?So what are you saying, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guy who cares too much about car displays?What I'm saying is, is that The Crew, neither the base game or DLC are worth it anymore, not even on sale price. You'll end up disappointed, trust me. And if you don't trust me, trust the 7600 other negative reviews about this abomination of a once decent game.Thanks for reading.			"

												This game can be very fun, and it definitely has a lot of options, both for single/campaign mode, as well as online mode. I'm definitely not a big fan of online gaming, but I did give it a try on this game and I will admit that I did enjoy it. What PISSES me off about this game is the fact that for certain challenges (in story mode) they computer AI CHEATS LIKE A MOTHER F*@#ER and it drove my blood to boil a lot of times, to the point that I almost threw my controller at the computer monitor. I wish they would 1, allow for different difficulty modes, especially for those people that are more about story line than gameplay, and 2, that they would allow for the use of trainers/cheats for the campaign only part of the game. I thought the visuals were pretty stunning, particularly the settings. I really loved the whole continental US map which you can freely drive to your heart's content. I wish they would have an update that would allow for a road trip to Alaska, that would just be AWESOME! Anyway, I do recommmend the game, however be warned you will lose your cool at some point... If you're that type of gamer that hates it when the computer AI cheats both the physics, and the fact that the other drivers are always faster than you, despite having a higher levle car than the suggested level on screen.

												Got to play this game During the alpha and i tell you what!?!?! They have nailed it. The game is fantastic. Im writing this review During the Beta and the game is actually awesome! The servers work perfectly and me and my friend are able to drive withing a Meter of eachother without running one another off the road or causing an accident. Its a gread social racer. It definate perks are its massive recignisable world and its ability to entertain without forcing races on people. My only complaints are the Movie Grain at night time and the lack of FOV during the in car view giving the game a lack of speed. But besides that this game is fantastic and im really looking forward to seeing the games full release. 9/10			"

												Pros:Stunning Graphics.Huge world to explore.There are several types of cars to choose from.Customizations are good.Cons:Slow progression.Awful story, which does not really revolve around having a close crew, or cars themselves. It is a stupid revenge story with terrible dialogue.Pvp is not even balanced. all car tiers are allowed. there is no way to race friends equally.Frustrating AI.Ridiculous physics.Online functions are shallow. It does not feel important at all. They are repeated over and over again.Cars do not feel that different.Pointless radio towers.Police are on all sorts of drugs and cant catch♥♥♥♥♥♥And mainly the game focuses more on stupid arcarde missions like collecting packages or smashing cars, which are repeated over and over again in the story mode.You spend more time doing stupid side missions that are repetitive.Instead of racing.THE GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A CREW			"

												Alright, with quite a bit of beta play and about 20 hours of release version play (despite steam's counter reading 14 at the time of writing), I think I'm able to give some preliminary opinions on this game. First off, this game is not perfect. There are little graphical and gameplay quirks that happen here or there, such as the cockpit view getting a little glitchy past 200mph, and annoying car resets after what should have been seamless, on the fly missions that place you exactly where you were, but stopped. Not to mention, the server system seems a little flaky.  One second, I am online with a dozen players, and after completing a mission, I am completely alone. However, this is a brand new release, and with Ubi marketing this as more of an MMO, I'm holding out hope that those things will be taken care of in the future.Those hangups aside, the game has proven to be quite enjoyable. Physics wise, on road car handling almost reminds me of the good old days of the 1st Need For Speed: Most Wanted. Perhaps, just a little grittier, but fun nonetheless. In my honest opinion, off the road is where this game really shines, though. For anyone who's played the game FUEL, off road vehicle handling should feel awfully familiar to you. I was excited to hear that a few devs from the FUEL team worked on this game, and you can certainly notice the influence they had.As far as gameplay? Missions aren't all that much to talk about, none are particularly outstanding, but they pace them well, and I've yet to get bored. Car customization was not nearly as in-depth as I had hoped, which is dissapointing. Certain cars can't even be modded in ways that would seem to make sense. For example, you cannot take a Ford Raptor truck, and convert it into the rally car / prerunner - esque ""Raid"" type. Meanwhile, feel free to do that to your Nissan Z! The whole MMO aspect, I'm not so sure of yet... mainly because it doesn't seem to be working correctly yet. In short, the game has a LOT of potential, and I'm enjoying it so far despite it's quirks. However, there are some improvements that are needed to make this game really shine.			"

												Jacko Rating 7/10The Crew is the first MMO to do something different and use cars and driving instead of the usual aray of fantasy characters.It is an enjoyable mix of arcade/sim style racing with the added online benefits - namely being able to join and crew up with as many as 4 of your mates to race and cruise all over the USA.Strengths are definately the enjoyment you get out of messing about with your friends whilst in your hotted up car, the graphics are good for next gen but for the PC it could be better, 60 FPS on PC runs smooth enough, the sound effects from the cars are nice and beefy and last but not least the size of the map and drivable area is absolutely massive.The weaknesses are - its gets a bit laggy from time to time, there are not nearly enough visable players online making it not really feel like a MMO (at least not yet), not enough races on offer and the button mapping system is frustraiting when trying to really customize it.The final verdict after 42 hours of playing time is despite its flaws it is an addictive driving game especially when cruising around with mates but no substitute for a real racer (wait for Project Cars).  This is well worth your money if you intend to play with friends online and like a massive map of the USA to drive around but if you want a hardcore racer to post times and compete against mates then this will only annoy you.Pretty Good Game but could have been much better.

												So, here we go.I can see alot bad recommendations about it, but in my opinion its a great game. Lets start with a big map, i dont have seen so big map without loading points before, map is minilized version of real life Michigan, New York, Florida and California. There are also alot of cars with awesome classes and tuning, from stock to circuit, 5 classes in total. There are cars, pickup trucks and so on. (Season pass gives even more) Map is quite living, with citizens walking in cities and animals living in wild, trains move, aircraft, alot of traffic vehicles, emergency vehicles on duty and so on. Story is quite interesting, but little, but after finishing it, there are also alot of skills to do... and then awards (Each class of awards done gives you special nr plate). There are also landmarks, what locate an historical building or place with quick review of it from real life, i really liked to do these. (242 on total)  Cars have standalone levels to 1299, you unlock parts doing missions or skills, and then there is player level, up to 50. Snow mountains, where it gives your car more slippery, and fun to drift... also alot of racetracks and interesting places from real life US states, Salt lake drag strip and so on...  Cop chases are quite hard. Also each state has its own 20 car wrecks to collect, to get an hidden car for free.So... bad things about this game, you might meet some players in your session at each state.Crew invitation is still glitching around sometime, wont let somebody join... and PVP takes forever load, so... basically you drive alone... also friends i have in uplay, i never dont have seen them in my session, if only joined my crew.8 / 10.

												I loved the beta for this game. Tons and tons of detail were put into this and alot of time well spent. I let my friend who rarely plays racing games drive with a pc steering wheel I got and from him destroying the city we found some minor bugs. I really wanted to point out how getting from one place to another actually takes you onto the highway for a REAL cruise sometimes. These trips aren't 2 seconds down the road. When I wanted to get to NY City it took me a decent amount of time to get there by highway (probably about 15 minutes). I very much enjoy this aspect of the game because constantly racing your car and bashing through telephone poles in a racing game doesn't make me respect that racing reality. What really gets you to appreciate your car, in The Crew and in real life, is when you can drive it on the highway for a trip - destination after destination. When I got onto the highway in The Crew I felt even more confident in this game.			"

												I enjoy the driving and graphics in The Crew... also I hear a lot of people complaining on driving itself and what they have to go is open the settings and set ""Hardcore"" for assists, plus in some cases tune a bit...CONS:Even without FPS drops at steady 60fps everyone gets microstutters which don't affect fps (even if graphics is set to low).Ubisoft PLEASE FIX The MicroStutter so we can enjoy the game at its full!GameBreaking:Another issue is map texture load glitch when map stops loading and you are stuck in raw textures, usually it helps to use back to track button and the map loads, but sometimes it doesnt work and you have to restart the race (In races as Highway child and coast to coast) which makes it extremely frustrating as those are 50min-1:30hr long races.Will change to positive once microstutter and map load glitch are fixed...I mean it's been over a year now and I think it's time to fix it now!Year and a half...UPDATE: Released 19/12/2014 today is 17/08/2016 and they still didn't fix ""Map Load Bug""...Don't buy this pile of garbage.

												This game has got a massive amount of negative reviews... and to be honest is the best racer i have ever played.I did get the Gold version on sale so am reviewing at about a $40 price tag.Pros:Enough content to keep you playing for life (Skills/PvP/Faction and Story Missions.)Graphics - Buttery smooth on my setupOpen World (US scaled by Autodesk)The satellite animations zooming from map view to car and vice versa is damn sexyUpgrading of cosmetics and performance for cars is prettySkill level upgrading - driver and performance parts upgrading for carsCons:Main problem I have is that at the moment servers are packed with players but if UPlay or the Crew servers are down, you cannot play until they are back up. Physics of 'barriers' on collision can have the strangest effects at times like space shuttle launch type strange :) First impression: Bought a Camarro... took it out on the street thinking it was going to be me and some ai doing missions. Came across these 3 Russian dudes doing donuts in a side street... They invited me to their Crew and we finished the Story missions together and are working on faction missions. There is no language barrier for burning rubber and nitrous fumes.Each has their own impression ... for me this is 11/10 and supercedes NFS and Grid series with drawing me in and return value to the game.

												The Crew is everything I have hoped for in a racing game for years. It combines the fantastic customization options of Need For Speed: Underground with the thrill of the high speed chases of Hot Pursuit, as well as including more serious racing environments for fans of series like Forza and Gran Turismo, and even putting heavy focus on rallycross and extreme offroad racing.The storyline (at least as much of it that was included in the beta) was interesting the whole way through, even if it seemed like it was lacking in dialogue every now and then. The Crew offers a break away from the typical racing game storylines while still keeping you in the spirit of racing the whole time. The open world is enormous and has a lot of exploration and events to offer. The beta version included only the United States map, and I only had time to explore from Chicago to the east (and not even all of the east!). I don't know how much of the rest of the world will be included in the full release, but I am eager to find out come November. All in all, I give the game a SOLID 9/10. I'm nothing short of absolutely thrilled for the full release of the game, and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone with remote interest in open world or racing games.			"

THE CREW REVIEWImage of the in-game options[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] Image of more in-game options[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]Image of the World Map[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com]Image of an in-game event[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] The Crew is not a good game. While the concept of the game sounds great, Ivory Tower fails to execute it well. The cars all feel similar (the performance cars all feel the same as each other, the raid cars feel the same, etc) and don't control as good compared to other driving games. The game borrows many ideas from previous Ubisoft releases that don't really translate that well in a car. The online community for this game may as well not be there. There is a chat in-game but in the 20+ hours I've put into this game I've yet to see one person use it.. which can make it hard for people to find a Crew to party with in-game. Invites to races and events other people usually go unaccepted. While a large portion of the Crew relies on having a Crew, the game doesn't have a whole lot to offer for people looking for a single player experience. The map for this game is huge and allows you to drive from the east coast of the United States to the west coast. In between are rocky mountains, open plains, wildlife darting across the road, cops, pedestrian vehicles getting in the way, little towns at the end of dirt roads and huge cities. In between all these are hundreds and hundreds (it seems like) of events. There's a handful of events such as staying in between the lines, smashing through 'gates', going as fast as you can, mountain climbing, and more. Completing these events (and other races) reward you with a score based on how well you did and are rewarded with different car parts than you can equip to cars; increasing their overall stats. Instead of climbing towers to unlock portions of the map; making you work a little for your progress, the Crew has you drive up to the satellite dishes located by a blinking aura on your map and GPS. The story is extremely dull, laughable and perdictable.You play as Alex, a man wrongly jailed for the death of his friend. You have the chance you redeem your freedom as FBI Agent Zoe sends you information on the man who killed your friend, and she believes the police officer, Coburn, who arrested you is working behind the scenes with Shiv. You must race your way to the top, earn your ink, and take down Shiv. The music is subpar, instantly forgettable and I found a hard time finding something I enjoyed listening to in-game.If you're interested in the Crew to get your racing game fix I would suggest looking elsewhere. There's plenty of other racing games out there that are multiple times better that'd you actually enjoy. Also, uPlay sucks.			"

												I would say I absolutely do recommend this game if you like games like Test Drive Unlimited, and Need For Speed, that being said, there are some MAJOR downsides to this game but overall I find it a rather good game.Let's start with the cons to get that out of the way.   -Hard to Start OutAs in it's rather hard to get money for actual good vehicles. I feel as you progress more, it'll be easier but when you have to go and get performance vehicles.... be prepared to spend lots of your time grinding for money if you want an actual decent car.   -RankedI feel as though they let you go into ranked WAY too early as I went into it (Not at all knowing what I was doing...) and was matched with the top of the top players (Platinum, Gold, Etc.). While they had level 1499 Vehicles, i sat there with a puny level 300..... As that may be my own fault for rushing it, I just recommend if you play to wait a LONG time before playing ranked.   -Street ChallengesAs this may just be my own personal opinion, I find as you're driving down the road, the excessive amount of Street Challenges are way too much. They typically cover the entire road, and frankly try to force you to do them. You literally have to swerve off the side of the road to avoid them... Personally, I just find them annoying as they hardly reward you anything and are quite dull, typically trying to force me off the path I was originally going.    -Wild RunAs this isn't nessicarily a con to me, I find lots of people complaining since the season pass didnt include Wild Run. As I didn't pre-order or buy the Season Pass expecting it (Due to me buying the game far after the big fuss about it happened) I don't find this really a con since it's only $10 more. Though do be warned, season pass doesn't include ALL dlc like most games have it. It lacks a big item that the game basically requires and tries to force onto you, Wild Run.   -Basic Story PlotI won't spoil anything for you but, if you have ever played Need For Speed: Undercover.... This is basically that game. It has pratically the exact same plot and will give you extreme de ja vu.    -Bad Graphics...As this isn't such a big deal to me, the graphics for some things do make me laugh. The graphics for scratches are incredibly cheaply made... That's really all I have for that one... It's just rather funny how horrible they are. Now Onto the Pros  -Long StoryAt the time of writing this, I am 10.3 Hours into the game, and still not even halfway into the game. It seems to be VERY long which I absolutely love, something most games nowadays seem to lack.  -Some Nice CarsThere are some very nice, detailed cars in the game. Though expensive.   -EntertainingI've always been a big fan of Racing Games and I can say, this game I absolutely fell in love with. It's one game that I can actually sit down and play for a long while without getting bored, which is very few for me.     -ControlsOkay, This is moreso to personal preference but - The Controls for this game is rather different compared to most games. If you're using a controller, it may seem a bit weird just to how the handling is, but I can say after a while you will get use to it. I personally fell in love with it. I would probably rate this game 7/10... It could definitely be better, but It's still rather good. A nice relaxing game to come home to if you have nothing else to do			"

												I'm sure most of you have already watched movies such as the Fast and Furious, right? Now, who wouldn't want to roleplay as a bunch of street racers out cruising on the city with pimped-out rides fighting for bragging rights?The Crew is an open world, online multiplayer arcade racing game that lets you crew up with people to challenge others all over five major areas in the United States. That single line alone got me hooked enough to take the game and see for myself. After several hours clocked in, I managed to pin-point a few things that make this game great, at the same time notice a few issues that could be resolved in the future hopefully.The Pros:- Probably one of the biggest selling points of this game is the fact that it's open world. They weren't kidding when they said, ""If you can see it, you can drive there"" part, with a minor exception from the world's boundaries. From busy streets, to wide highways, to rocky mountain tops, to the vast fields. You can race, or chill-out, practically anywhere given that you have already driven to that spot before. To add to this, the game allows you to warp anywhere with minimal to no loading time whatsoever. Always a plus on my book.- The rides aren't limited to your typical street racer tuning. The game has several specifications that works on certain terrain and objectives. It allows you to customize your ride to best suit the situation at hand, like dirt specs for off-road challenges, and raid specs for heavy duty pursuits. A large chunk of the pimping-out option is available as visual customization for your ride, allowing drivers to make unique rides that they can show-off to others, or look awesome winning in them during races.- This is a multiplayer game after all, so what could be more exciting than racing as a crew? Imagine cruising down the streets as a 4-man team out looking for trouble or a challenge. Visualize being chased down by cops while your crewmates dive right in to clear a path for you. Or you could just troll people around and block busy streets just for fun.The Cons:- No game is perfect after all, especially during its first launch, so don't expect too much or you'll just end up disappointed like some. While the game is labled as an MMO, players are divided into ""sessions"" much like RPG games have ""server channels"". Most of the time players see only a handful of people in their current session, sometimes no one at all. While I have no idea what are the maximum number of players per session is, it would be nice if I could see 20+ drivers or so in every coast. Not too much though, or it would be chaos. Some people are complaining about not being able to see their friends in-game as well to crew up, which is quite a let down.- AI in this game is quite annoying in my opinion. First of, the term ""rubberbanding"", in reference to the elasticity of a rubber band, means that car A will not move too far away from car B in most situations. For example, you're in a race wherein you're in first place. The 2nd place AI will ""rubberband"" its way towards you no matter what situation it gets stuck in. It will suddenly dive towards you at ridiculous speeds even if it had just recovered from a crash. It works both ways when you're the one at 2nd, the 1st place AI seems to slow down a bit to allow you to get back into the race. Imagine the ""rubberbanding"" on police vehicles, chases aren't as exciting as it should be. In fact, it's difficult and down right scary.- The physics and controls on this game is a little off, I think. I mean, yes, driving at high speeds have this tendency to lose control obviously. But the handling and recovery is just too darn difficult.  The vehicles tend to spin-out easily, lose traction and so on. Let's not get started on the police, especially when they decide to break in front of you, they turn into a solid brick wall you can't possibly push aside. On the plus side, however, these cops really know how to do pit manouvers and stuff. And I think the handling of the cars can be remedied with the right car parts. Just expect to have a hard time at the start though.All in all, despite the ups and downs, The Crew is still a fun game to have, especially if you love the challenge and the thought of having one awesome ride as an avatar. It's barely a week into release and I'm sure we can expect better things to come from this game. If you're debating on picking this up, my personal opinion is go for it.  I mean, why not? It's not a bad game, but it's not the best either, but I'm sure this game has potential to get up there on the list. Hope to see you guys on the streets. Later.			"

												Find some people on Steam to play with and form a Crew. I have made 3 great new friends in the past 2 days from playing this game. Having people to play/cooperate/compete with makes this game so much fun, and you will always try to beat each-others records on trials and watch their tail during races. It is co-op, so if the objective is (for example that we found) to, say, finish 3rd or higher, and only one person in the event achieves it, you all get rewarded. I usually am the brute in our Crew, I drive a Dirt or Street spec'd Ford Raptor. I will keep the AI drivers at bay by ramming and cutting them off, and my friends will use their Skyline or Charger to win the race(Though the Raptor can perfectly keep up if I want!). We all have a role that we use to emerge victorious as a group, and the game really rewards teamwork.--There is so much I would like to write about, but I am tired (from playing so long). The driving isn't Asetto Corsa level, but if you want to have a blast driving, this game does it. I have had some times where the others went off line, and I just drove, and drove, and drove, and went to the coast, traveled to the mountains and hot-swapped for my Dirt-spec ride and tore up the ground all the way down the mountain.--If you have a steering wheel with force feedback, The Crew uses every ounce of it. I was a beta tester, and I was surprised that they had full support for my wheel, the Logitech Driving Force GT. It's not a mainstream wheel, it was designed for the PS3, but it works on PC with 900 degrees of rotation and force feedback. All the buttons work, I have not had to tweak anything. It just, WORKED.--Ask me anything you like in the comments, I would be happy to answer questions you have about the game.			"

												Wild Run DLC is a complete scam. If you only had the base game and played co-op with random people up until now, now you can't, as ""look for a crew"" thing now requires you to pay ♥♥♥♥♥on of money for the new DLC. Yep, you heard it, Ubisoft actually removed a crucial feature and turned an Online game into essentially a Singleplayer experience, hell, this game is named ""The Crew"" and ""Look for a Crew"" button is paywalled? What the hell?! You call it an MMO, and ask me to pay for the second M? WHAT THE HELL?!Did I mention Uplay? Better not.			"

												The Crew represents what I personally missed in recent racing games. It isn't a racing simulator, so don't expect full realism while in the driver' seat, but what you get in terms of handling is more than enough to enjoy the fun. Simply put: there's a fair background story, many cars, a gazillion of races and an explorable map that is the whole U.S.A. territory; all of this is what makes The Crew a very good arcade racing game. Sometimes, though, the arcade model becomes too evident (yes, Raid-spec ""smuggling runs""... while also some PvP events...), but all in all this is an experience worth trying, especially if you plan to play it using a racing wheel set like the Logitech G27 (fully supported). If you're an old NFS fan and miss the good old Most Wanted times, here you'll find your new home.			"

												I'm surprised this game doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves. It's hands down one of the best racing games I have played in a very long time. I played the beta and was impressed, but having played a lot yesterday I saw why they said ""Don't trust the hurried, rushed reviews for this game."" because things start getting even better as you go along.Doing one of the big weekly faction races is what finally put the ""this game rules!"" thought into my head, becauset there I was 25 checkpoints into a race with 110 checkpoints going all over the country when it dawned on me that this game isn't just about the quck pick up races and fancy cars, it's about skill and endurance. Not only that, it's sometimes just beautiful to look at as I've been guilty of just driving slow and looking around at the incredible world that Ivory Tower built.This game really shines when you are racing along the world in the drivers seat view, I switch when I need to but being In the drivers seat is where its at for me.I say this game is well worth the money. I look forward to playing even more.			"

												##WARNING## HONEST REVIEW**{[READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE EVEN LOOKING AT THIS GAME]}**Guys everyone who bought this game and said there arent enough cars is a lunitic because there alot of cars considering that you multiply that by 5 because every car has diferent car classes that make that car behave so much more diferently. Also the makers of this game (Ubisoft) are going to release 2 more car classes, motorcycles and better graphics.  The 2 new car classes are going to be drift cars and monster trucks. I have to comment on the graphics because the graphics are not the best (they will be inmproved) they are good enough graphics. Anyone who judges a game on graphics should really change there ways.**BOTTOM LINE THIS IS A GREAT GAME THAT WILL GET BETTER SOON**			"

												I have been playing The Crew for about 2 hours.From a racing simulation point of view, the game lacks in various areas such as handling, physics, drivetrain, shifting. All vehicle handles nearly the same, with more or less understeer. Gearbox is odd, and slow while shifting/down shifting, handbraking is slow. On road, cars rarely spin out, but when pushing them to the limit, the cars will throw the rear end out, but refusing to turn. There are three modes of driving: All Assistance, Sport, Hardcore. All assistance would include ABS, Traction, steering stability, etc. Hardcore has less traction and less steering stability. Drifting is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥on keyboard, but manageable on Sport and Hardcore mode.Tuning is simplified and a lot easier for the general audience, nothing too complicated. Parts are found during runs and story events, Gold, Silver, Bronze, each adding x amount of additional car level. Level cap for players is at 50. Level caps for cars are at 1299.From a car enthusiast point of view, for those who just wants to collect and drive the cars, and tune (not in-depth tuning), this game is great. Graphics are beautiful, damages to the vehicle is mildly realistic, environment is great. You wont be able to run over people though, just like that in Driver San Francisco, they would jump away with Level 9001 reflex skills. Engine sound effects on the cars come close to that of real cars, but only when not in cutscenes. Engine sounds from cutscenes souds like that of a muscle car, V6/V8. Collecters will still need to play the game and some events to make money, in order to mod the car. Game is Pay to Win or Play to Win.The R34 GT-R is left hand drive, which does not exist, and makes the petrolhead in me heartbroken.The Street Car upgrade in game gives a wheel (rim) which resembles 5Zigen Noir, which makes the Purist in me cry. Other recognizable brand of wheels (for those who care) includes: BBS (:D), HRE (:D), ROTA (D:), Volk Racing (:D) and of course, Original Equipment Manufacterer (OEM) wheels.All Street Cars are stock height, which makes me Iacrophobic.Game cannot be played with no internet connection, from what I've seen.Best part about the game is that they have a replica Pike's Peak Uphill/Downhill sprint run in the Midwest. Very fun to do a tandem drifting run up/down with a friend.Rate Game 6/10. It's not bad, but it's far from perfect. Definitely recommend for car lovers. Definitely a great game to go cruising around with friends and racing around town.			"

												One of the best racing games I've ever played. Don't look at those ""Mixed"" reviews. Like 80% of negative reviews are like ""I pre-ordered The Crew + Season Pass and got no Wild Run DLC, clear scam."" Maybe, however I was smarter and just waited for the first steam sale. And there I go. After one and a half year, where the game was quite advanced I finnaly got my sale.The Crew Wild Run Edition for 30€.Now time for the actual review. The game has a decent storyline. The only thing that disappointed me, is it's linearlity. It is really linear, you genrally can't change anything, there are no decisions. For example I think that SPOILER ALERT:  You should have a choice of either killing Shiv or getting him caught by the police. Gameplay is great, PVP pays-off extremely and has some justice in it. For example, when you or someone other in the race have a lag, the game waits for you/him.I also think that there should be more Radio Stations and more tracks in them. Option to add your own radio stations like from GTA 3 Upwards should be supported two.Graphics are beautiful, car decorating options are great too.An overall of 8,9/10 for me, good job Ubisoft, one of your best productions...

												Unless you are rich like me, I really don't actually suggest this game.If you want to get anywhere, you gotta spend money.When the wild run expansion came out, it costed like 30 bucks here and you were literally just paying for 3 new specs, a bike, a drift car, and a monster truck. Why the hell is this not free? The Crew wasn't even released that complete, and then they lock off half the cars just to milk money.The game itself is actually pretty fun, but the handling needs to be adjusted in the options, and the map wasn't the ""whole america.""The selection of cars is very little and it's stupidly small added with the wildrun dlc.This game has microtransactions everywhere, and although it is pretty easy to make money in this game, it's obvious Ubisoft is a money milking corporation.The graphics are beautiful, though.TLDRUnless you have around 150 bucks, don't expect to get much content out of the game quicklyGraphics are good, and the map isn't really the ""whole america,"" though it's still pretty good.Kill yourself Ubisoft, why can't you design a game that doesn't milk money for once.

												There are some few minor bugs in this game. But its a new game, and i guess they will fix it with time.So what is good, and what is bad?Well i think its a really nice game, an open world car game. That you can play online in, its really cool to cruise around mount rushmore or just on the road with your friends. And even play against them.Something i want, is more cars, and more missions.The singleplayer is also pretty good, you play as a guy called Alex. And you are going to jail for 5 years. After the years are over, you work for the FBI and wanna get revenge on your brothers killer.To do that, you need to get a cool car, and go race against the 5-10!The game is good in itself, and i would recommend it if you like to cruise around.5/5			"

												I've clocked almost 50 hours in The Crew - an obvious recommendation. I am currently level 27 and still exploring the first of 5 regions (more about that later). Why is it fun?The Crew has a huge map, a huge number of difficult races and skill challenges, reasonable AI, the longest races I have ever seen in a computer game, a varied selection of cars right from the start, and a good system for levelling up cars, doing PvP, and doing co-op PvE with or without friends. It is a bit of a cross between FUEL (its game world is bigger, but emptier) and NFS:World (which has a more crowded MMO-feeling, but is pay2win and not as social). It has Burnout Paradise's ability to initiate challenges right in the game world without going to an instance, so you may be driving along and see a car flying through the air because you're passing a jump challenge and someone's doing it; or see everyone else's police pursuits (join in if you like).The level cap is at 50, there are 5 regions, you can go anywhere at any time, but the events and cars of a new region unlock every 10 levels. So in theory, since my main focus is still the first region (Mid-West - of course you start in Detroit), I shouldn't be over level 10, upgrading my car with level 1-10 parts won from skill challenges available in that region, and generally having a good time; and I should be able to level out of that region by following the storyline missions, if I like, which I probably am. But the game also provides other ways to level up: you can grind story missions (even accidentally, if you want to improve your score from bronze to gold; and the game also makes you, because other player will invite you on coop runs - of course you can decline), you can do faction missions once you are level 10 (out of curiosity), or you can do PvP (a dozen races was enough to get me from level 21 to 27). This will unlock other car types (good) and the parts sets that come with the level (bad, because I now could just buy me all level 20 parts for my car and skip the East Coast region altogether, and with a bit more PvP, skip the South, too). Maybe The Crew should have taken a slice from GuildWars, where you're a) PvP-ready from the beginning with competitive gear (but you can use your own high-end PvE gear as well), and b) levels and player capabilities are adjusted on the fly depending on the level of the region you're in so that co-op works well.Right now, I exercise some restraint and explore and do the skill challenges and the exploration anyway, and the nice thing about The Crew is that even though my cars are somewhat overpowered for the zone (what with the stat boost levelling up gives them -- why, exactly?), the challenges are still tough to get golden. At the rate I'm going, there'll be many more hours of fun in this game.If I could do it over, I would play each story mission only once and stay away from anything social (PvP, Factions, co-op) until level 40 at least. Recommended.			"

												So...... you like to drive huh?Thats what this game has to offer. Its truly not some entirely new racing experience. Its midnight club, burnout, need for speed, all rolled into a new game, The Crew. Many people have criticized this game for its sub-par graphics, arcade like driving/physics, and it not being a true ""MMO"". And while that may be true in many cases, you also must take into account for the scale of this game. No other game truly allows you to drive from Miami to LA in one sitting all the while seeing every different biome along the way. It's fulfilling to be able to go from a small town, to the mountains, to main roads, and then to main cities. I will admit that this game is far from completely polished but that does not mean its fun and enjoyable. I have around 50 hours right now and while around 25 of that was the main story, the rest has been me farming the skill missions and overall, trying to explore the massive world of The Crew. So in the end, yes you might not be getting a perfect game, but its still one to remember, and it will continue to get better with patches, dlcs, etc etc.			"

Must buy at any price [x]Worth the money but wait for a small sale [✓]Wait for a huge discount [x]Avoid at all costs [x] INTRODUCTION The Crew, a game made by Ivory Tower which are former Test Drive developers, Test Drive was a good game loved by many so everyone had alot of high expectations for The Crew (very high expectations) which is why some people were disappointed, for over-hyping this.That doesn't mean The Crew is bad though, it's an open world (very open world with no invisible walls, except a huge wall beside Mexico) racing game, it has a story , official cars with a wide variety, replayability, but you may ask ""Isn't it once you finish The Crew it's done?"" yes it does, BUT , you can buy very low level cars and feel like it's a new run again. CARS I think we all had huge hopes for good cars, Ivory Tower didn't fail us...The game has around 40-130 cars (I couldn't find an exact number, these are the lowest and highest numbers of cars people told me about) , It has a huge variety of manufacturers going from Spyker to Lamborghini to Fiat ect.It's got all the cars we love, all the popular and even forgotten car manufactureres.You get ""Specs"" which are modifications for your vehicles, the specs are: Fullstock, Street , Dirt , Performance , Raid , Circuit. With DLC: Drift , Monster truck , Drag , Cops. STORY Nothing special, it's a racing game it doesn't require an in-depth story but we got one, without it the game would be a little odd but luckly we got one. You and your brother belong to the street racing network 5-10, it's illegal but popular, you and your bro go to meet the top dog, he kills your brother but you were accused of it as the cop leader was bribed with ALOT of money, you were sent to jail for about 5 years until you're partnered undercover with the cops, climbing the ladder to the top, going through leaders of spec vehicles , making them your friends until eventually, you're on the top with the killer, you confront him in a club, about to shoot him but you're smart enough not to, you do one last race with him, defeat him and he disappears, the cop leader gets jailed and you live happily ever after. OPEN WORLD The world is completely open, no invisible walls, nothing.You see a cliff in the playable area, you can go to it, the world is detailed and intresting , with sadly few easter eggs but fun ones, the world has some real race tracks and cities, the world is huge and it would take some time following 1 specific road from one end of the map to the other. GRAPHICS They're nice, especially in photo mode (check my profile for some screenshots), but they're pretty demanding, on my overclocked GTX 950 2gb vram I can run with SSAO+ , FXAA and mostly high settings at 60fps mostly at all times.Photo mode is beautiful, fell in love with it. PHYSICS They're weird, your car is stuck to the ground which is sadly annoying (can't go crazy with cliffs) but for overall driving feels good, you can play on ""normal, sport , hardcore"" modes which enable tc, disable tc ect.Drifting feels good, racing at high speeds does, collision is choppy but can deal with it.

												I was really excited for the release of this game, and I NEVER take the time to review games, ever. But this one enraged me to the point I have to let people know to NOT buy this game. no doubt I will combust any moment for wasting my hard earned money on this pile of pixles so Ill just keep it simple and make a list of the issues. only 3 for me, because I only got past the TUTORIAL. And dont get me wrong, Ive spent more time messing with settings than playing the game to know my issues are real.1. FIVE times before you get into the gameplay they make it very apperent they want you buying wildrun DLC, this is stupid, was my 30 dollars not good enough?. 5 times I got advertisments shoved in my face before playing. not the point of a game.2. the camera snapping back uncontrollably to the forward position anytime W is pressed, now I understand why this is needed, GTA did a good job of this, smooth transitioning back to front view. the crew snaps you back when your trying to look left or right and it freaks out when you try to look anywhere but directly forward. This is a car game. I want to look at my car, and look where I want to go. not just straight. this was a game breaker for me 100%.3. after spending even more time tinkering with the steering controls, I for some strange reason couldnt tell I was driving a Camaro. I thought I was steering a bus. Game was unplayable for mydelf due to these very annoying features, dont get me wrong if these 3 things dont bother you, I hope you enjoy the game. Im just trying to save peoples time if they share my opinion.0.0/100			"

												When I bought the game, I just had a keyboard. I just said meh. The steering and handling is too bad. But a year later I got a steering wheel, and it got sooo much better. Now it is fun to play this game - I think.The graphics are pretty good. If you just bought your dream car you can drive around with it and it looks almost real. And yeah, they have added a lot of good modelled cars. And if you get the season pass there are even more cars!You can also play online with your friends as I do. You and your friend can take your dream cars (if they are in the game xD) and explore the huge map together or do races on the different race tracks. Or you would help each other finish the exciting story. The only negative thing wiht this game is the wierd handling - In my opinion though			"

												I loved this game and have so much, i plan on getting all cars, acivements, DLC, rewards, and anything else i can get out of it. I will reach 1,000 hours playing this game soon and keep going. This is the best game that has come out so far. Right up there with forza horizen 2, except for PC. I have never got bored of this and still have allot of places to see in america. i learned allot about this contry from this game and saw the lands beauty first hand (digitaly). the landscape is amazing and the new Wild Run expansion doesnt come out for a few months. I love when costomization is supirior and unlimited. This is the only game that will give you the ability to drive formula 1 cars, track cars, rally cars, common street cars, armored cars, monster trucks, drift cars, drag, and moterbikes open world anywere you want. Btw, the bikes will have those specs too.This arcade racer is the best for doing almost anythig, me and my freinds love to just go on top of a mountain and drive off the cliff and see who lands farthest, other times we try to smash every one who is landing from a ramp jump. They think its funny too because thay're not in any kind of race, just exploring. I made freinds that way too xD.the PvP events are also good because you never have 3-6 year olds saying stupid stuff like on COD, and racing isn't the only kind of PvP thing, there are many game modes like the most recent is crown, aka capture the flag. and people are respectfull, if there is somone in the same faction i sometimes defend and give them the win since you get allot of money no matter how much you win, winning PvP just raises your faction level, witch is good but at least you get allot of moneythe best part is, is the game actually starts when the story is finnished, when you hit level 50 that when you really play. and the updates are awsome, new car evry month, and patches to fix bugs all the time. Add this to your wishlist and the next time it goes on sale, get it. this game is awsome.			"

												8/10 - Fun, addictive game with lots of growth potential.  I gave it a 8/10 instead of a 10/10 because the game isn't easy to learn or it's not user friendly and it needs more cars; there are only a little more than 200 cars available in the game.  That said once you learn how to play, this game is amazing.  'The Crew' reminds me of my beloved racing game Gran Turismo, but much better and with traffic, an open world and random weather.  I played Gran Turismo 1-5, I'm familiar with the game and engine, this game is most definately built off the same platform.  The vehicle modifaction system has been changed and the game has a story with a plot as well as being massively multiplayer.  You're allowed to play all the game's different modes in a ""Crew"" or a 4 man team of your friends.  When you start out you have a choice of cars available at the Detroit car dealer.  As you unlock the game by beating story missions, there are 5 car dealerships and 1 motorcycle dealership.  I recomend starting with either the 2011 Mustang GT or the Nissan 370Z as they have several different specs the vehicles can be tuned to.  Much like Gran Turismo the vehicles are rated based on what 'The Crew' calls vehicle levels or Gran Turismo players know as performance points.  There are several different spec's a full stock car can be tuned to.  The game comes with 5 specs.  To unlock 'extreme specs' you need to purchase the 'Wild Run' upgrade.  Standard Specs:1 - Street2 - Dirt3 - Performance4 - Raid5 - CircuitWild Run 'Extreme' specs:A - Monster TruckB - DriftC - Dragand a new vehicle type: Motorcycles... which kick♥♥♥♥♥by the way.  Each spec a vehicle is tuned to can level up by unlocking parts via challenges, game missions or PVP events thus increasing it's performance point rating.  1299 is the max vehicle level/performance point rating available at this time.  As you complete missions new areas unlock, new vehicle specs and new vehicles are available.  The best way to earn money, rep and league points is to PVP.  It's by far the best way to earn money and rep.  You compete against other players based on how much you play, not how well you finish in races.  You have a choice of 5 PVP factions you can join.  The wolves, the snakes, the gators, the eagles, and some other faction that isn't memorable.  Your rep is compared to the rep of the other players in your faction.  If you have the highest rep in your faction, you're the boss and get a base salary of $150,000 per day.  If you're not the highest paid player, like most people, you fall somewhere in the middle.  Underboss = $100,000 daily, Street Boss = $60,000, Lieutenant = $30,000, Thug = $10,000.  I don't remember what Gangsta pays, but it isn't much, maybe $5,000 daily??  Yes finishing in 1st place pays better, but the difference between 1st and 8th isn't much.  The Devs encourage people to PVP with this system.  Traffic and collisions can be turned off to enhance your gaming experience.  Every player in the PVP lobby gets to choose what map they would like to race on.  Then based on what the players chose (5 players, 5 maps) the computer randomly selects one of the maps all of the players in the lobby chose and then everyone races on that map.  You can PVP solo or with a crew (4 man team).  To start I recomend the 2011 Mustang GT or the Nissan 370Z.  Both of these cars can be tuned to Street, Dirt, Raid, Performance or Circuit which is why I recomend them.  Money is tight early on in the game.  My recomended cars/bikes:Street: KTM 450, Nissan GTR, 2015 Mustang Fast BackDirt: KTM 450, RUF 3400K, HummerRaid: KTM 450, RUF 3400K, Buggy, HummerPerformance: Ford GT, Mclaren F1, Pagani Huayra, Lamborghini Superlegera, BMW 1000RR, Ferrari 458 SpecialCircuit: Ford GT, Lamborghini Superlegera, BMW 1000rr, Ferrari 458 Special			"

												I bought The Crew 2 weeks ago and I haven't been bored of it yet! The game accomplishes this by using the clever tactic of crashing before the player even has a chance to do anything, thus eliminating any possibilty of the gameplay getting stale.			"

												The Crew is one of those racing games that you just have to play even if it has Ubisoft's name on it. Let's get all of the BS rumors out of the way by saying UBISOFT DID NOT DEVELOP THIS GAME!!!! Ivory Tower developed this game with the ability of having 60 FPS at the start and yes it does have micro transactions but earning in-game cash is super easy. This game isn't tanted with Ubisoft's bad pc port mojo. This is a super stable game and I occasionaly experience a crash once or twice a day.So gameplay, how is it? Well the gameplay is well how any Need for Speed from Underground 2 through Carbon but with a twist. This game has RPG elements thats similar to Need for Speed World but is not purposly asking you to empty your wallets into a pay wall. It is open world and the world is really huge. It is close to 50 in-game miles and it will take you a long time to get you there. You have a level (50 is a max) in which you level up by doing story missions (yes it has a story), skill challenges, PvP events, and faction missions. The story missions is what it is labeled as, missions that's part of the story. The skill challenges offer a way to gain car parts (more on that later) and get some experience for doing it. There is also a leaderboard so you can compete against a person's ghost and see if you can get to the top of the leaderboard. PvP events are what it is labeled. You go against other players and you can choose to fight for your faction or just free-for-all. Faction missions are where you get a lot of money, faction experience in which that adds everyday you login, and some chunk of experience. They also have one hour long races and one that goes up to 4 hoursWhat are these car parts you mentioned above? Well those car parts give your car a level as well ranging from 0-1299. The car parts consist of a motorcore, air system, diff, tires, weight reduction, and more. There are five classes of cars and each car class is different to each other: There is Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Street is your step above stock. Dirt is something you would see from a World Rally Championship. Performance is your step above Street but is almost stripped out. Raid is something you see from the Dakar Rally and yes they have trophy trucks. Circuit is something you see from Grand Touring ot 24 Hour Le Mons racing. The car is completely stripped down with weight saving and high performance in mind with the ability to take corners.Well since this is a driving game, how are the physics? The physics can be odd but if you work around them, you can win a lot of the races. Drafting is a thing so use it when you can. The cars will tend to bounce off of things like bumper cars and it focuses a little on drifting.Hows the car customization? It is what you would expect from a Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon game. You can customize the interior with your choices of aluminum, carbon fiber, mixed aluminum, and mixed carbon fiber. You cannot place stickers anywhere you want to though. They have presets which look cool IMO.Car selection? How big is it? Well IMO it is small but it will slowly expand with DLC. The car list consists of 58 total cars but at least they have trucks.Final thoughts? Well I am enjoying the game. I am enjoying every bit of time I have put into the game. I would recommend everyone getting the Season Pass since they are going to add more cars. January 2015 is going to be their first DLC which should be an interesting one. I did wish they have given us the ability to move around the stickers rather than give us presets and working mirrors in the cockpit (yes a working cockpit). This game I believe will set a new standard on the illegal arcade street racing genre that was leaving a sour taste in my mouth because of the way Need for Speed has been going and from the look of things, it isnt going to get any better. You just have to play this game to know what I feel about this game. I have been dying to play a game thats open world with similar car customization as Need for Speed Most Wanted and Carbon but isn't trying to make your wallets screem and this is the answer my friends.UPDATE: Next Tuesday of updating this review, they are adding three more cars into the game if you don't count the Mini Cooper non-street edition we got at launch. I havent experienced any big crashes. Loading the game will freeze your computer if you are using a controller with XInput. I still would recommend this game. The AI can have some stupid rubber banding but AI can be difficult in a racing game.			"

												I LOVE the game now a lot and Highly recommend it!! It is The Whole U.S. in Small mode. Top of my list in Massive MP driving games.The cars are beautiful and exotic, customizable. (Please avoid all those Tramp Stamp Stickers and goofy Colors though... Tasteless Teens!) This game is genius in design, years in the making from half the TDU2 Crew I heard.  It avoidsall the annoyances of TDU games and Burnout Paradise etc. The landscape is STUNNING in detail and activity. Also, best complete the game with the new Police addition. Don't be CHEAP,  support this effort and maybe there will be MORE additions! This is a long term keeper. Definately get the Ultimate pack as all those extras like cars and modes are going to be a must. I love taking each car and motorcycle in my ""Hot Wheels"" collections ha ha and customizing paint the jobs and interiors, wheels, on and on. Check your Uplay Overlay and use those bonus points to unlock great stuff and cars in game and check your Monthly Challenges for easy big bucks.  Opening up the U.S. and seeing all these famous places very nicely done like no other before is intoxicating. I love to look and all the cut scenes in landmark locations ...all 248 of which will net you $500,000! Getting Daily Cash from Faction on booting is great.  My NAT is Moderate and works fine. I ""Rooted Manually"" as they call it in Start Menu correctly, (port forwarding or allowing pinholes through the Router Firewall settings for 5 Uplay ports and The Crew ...but still Moderate NAT. It made the game play worse it seemed, so I when Router Firewall default again. Clicking  DMZ will probably give me NAT OPEN, but then you have to depend on your Software Firewall and Anti-Virus etc to protect your computer from hackers! Game can lock up here and there requiring Windows key or ALT TAB or Ctrl Alt Del to Task Manager close game, Uplay or Steam Bootstapper to end, but I don't care anymore.My Driving Force GT wheel, (with a strip of Scotch Extreme Fastener velcro type tape in front to hold it on table strongly...wheels get loose and pull off!), works perfectly now with all buttons assigned just right and Wheel settings tuned well. My Track IR works with it. You can heard all sorts of languages from all over the globe commenting during chases as you can speak to players it seems. ( I found that an ability in all other versions of this game except Steam version is Blocked. One cannot purchase CC: Crew Credits in any way and this bug or block has been going on for years. I was given my bonus 110,000 Crew Credits and blew them all on Cars and upgrades.  Read in tips that it is best to use these for buying more Perk Points ideally. I clicked to buy $50 Platinum CC 600,000 as a shortcut wimp,  not needed,  the forum is right, the game is VERY generous and you do not need to buy CCredits. I must have bought 75 cars in just a few days. If you study all aspects of the game and look at guides on You Tube, it is easy to make $. Find all those 30 Data Stations...did in couple hours.)Totally Hooked on this game.			"

												Its a standard NFS(need for speed) game. I wouldnt say its straight arcade style but its not a simulator. Works well with steering wheel/pedals/shifter combo and if you have those items, you can feel the sim part of it while driving around the open world trying to decide what race style your in the mood for and it seems they have a vehicle for everyone with the ability to upgrade performance and looks. Enjoy online racing? You will probably enjoy this if you do.			"

												One of the most underrated racing games I've played. So much content that doesn't require real money to unlock and an online system that actually makes the game more fun. The cars are amazing, the graphics are good, and the gameplay is fun. The map is gigantic. My only complaint would be that I think the game would be better if the map was smaller and consisted for more winding roads like what you see when you hit the mountain areas. The map is really huge, but because of its size, a lot of the roads are straight and boring. I also wish the performance upgrading was more in dept instead of just having your car stats upgraded when completing races and challenges. I'd like it if I could pick my own exhaust, turbos, and other parts by brand and each having its own pros and cons in terms of how it effects your cars performance.I give it an 8/10.			"

												Best Racing game of the year. Ubisoft has done it this time and at last.I've been really mad at Ubisoft cause of it's crappy policy and marketing strategy, Watch_Dogs , Far Cry 4 and Unity. These games were expensive and not good as they look like. I was thinking about how worse Ubisoft can be, but even though I have these thoughts, still I made no prejudgement and watched stream on steam, talked with some friends about buying and forming our crew, and there I am driving across USA from East Coast to West Coast while feeling freedom and joy. The Crew is awesome.I was a racing-game lover when I was a kid. Played Midtown Madness, Most Wanted a lot and  loved those games. And here, in The Crew , gives me that joy. You can free ride all over the Usa, discover hidden car parts that unlocks a hidden car ( each from different regions ) or landscapes and antennas , similar to Creed Franchise. Then you can do challenges to receive car upgrades to increase your car level just like in MMO's , and the best part? Forming your own crew and driving together. I hope Ubisoft won't ruin this game and keep it updated with new cars, new stuff. The Crew is highly recommended for racing-lovers, people who used to play racing games and who likes Forza Horizon.Oh , forgot the best part. While driving around in L.A. and sun sets, it's best to listen to Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know , and hit it, One for the Road.10/10 Ubisoft makes me wanna cry.			"

This game has taken EA's Need for Speed series out of the business once for all.For me, this could probably be the game of the year, from a considerable small choice list. THIS is how Need for Speed should have been for 10 years and counting (talking about NFSU and NFSU2 as best in the series, don't get me wrong). THIS is what modern racing games should aspire to. THIS is an example of a great ""racing"" game campaign (you don't get to play only racing missions, but also takedown, escape, time attack, contrabands and so on). THIS is an example of a good open-world game concept, as you're always busy with something, there's no such thing as boredom in this game, only if you're low on imagination. The bugs? They're pretty minor and unnoticeable at the moment of release. You can see a deer stuck in some fences, whatever. There's no game without bugs and here's nothing preventing you from playing.The graphics? They're good. I don't mind calling them great as they perfectly fit a strong 2014 game engine. There are enough graphics options, and also do not think that the game is locked to 30 FPS. We can also expect graphics mods in the future.The PC performance? Not bad, I must admit. The system requirements are pretty ""fair"", but whatever, even a low-mid spec laptop can beat this game on low settings. I didn't experience any sort of stuttering, FPS drops, all this kind of stuff.The handling? Feels good to me. You can say it's bad if you played any other good handling games, but you easily get used to the car handling. Might sound funny, but in cockpit view it feels even better to me.Buy the game and don't mind about the cons, you won't get disappointed.			"

												I followed this game for quite a while before it came out. I was super psyched for a racing game with car customization in an open world, something Need for Speed has not done for a while now. However, I will admit that once it came out, I never really heard anything about it. It seems like I basically forgot. Then, a friend of mine got it and I ended up buying it on sale. Clearly, as you can see from my hours, I really have enjoyed this game. However, it has some serious quirks to it, and they aren't necessarily good. So, here's what I enjoyed about The Crew, and not so much.PROS:The Open World - I didn't realize just how big the map was until I really got into this game. It has, by far, the largest map out of any racing game I have played. I cannot compare it to FUEL simply because I have not played it, but it is bigger than every NFS game. And best of all? The map is not repetitive. You can drive from the swamps of the south to the deserts in the west, and have different scenery and small towns/cities in between. It mainly revolves around 5 major cities, and they are New York, Chicago, Miami, Las Vegas, and L.A. The developers certainly did their homework when it comes to the cities, and I applaud them for it. Even after 260 hours of gameplay, I still see places on the map I have not been, making the open world my favorite part of the game, by far.PvP - I find that the PvP is well done. You play in a lobby with up to 8 players at a time, who all choose exactly what event they want to do, and then the game randomly picks one of them. This includes events with any of the 5 specs. Some events are elimination, others regular races, and others a ""king of the hill"" type game. What's even better is the amount of in-game money you get from PvP. Even if you get last place, you still get nearly just as much money as the person in first, and this can make it enjoyable for anyone that plays. PvP is the best way to make money, currently. However, it still does matter what place you get, since there are PvP ranks in the game. The higher you place, the faster you rank up.The Graphics - Towards the end of 2015, a free update brought in new, updated graphics along with a weather system, which also includes slick roads after rain. This is all much better than before. Unfortunately, my lower-end GPU cannot handle max graphics, however, that is not to say that the game still looks very nice on High. It now looks more like a game released this year. Also props for it being a completely free update!Car Selection - You can have (almost) anything, from a LaFerrari, to a Hummer H1 Alpha, to a Dodge Challenger. What I like is that the game has 5 different specs for most cars (some ranging from just 1 spec to all 5), which are Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. Take, for example, the Challenger. It can have all 5 specs, so if you want to go on dirt roads with one, you hop into the dirt spec Challenger. If you want complete offroading, you go with raid. And if you want to take it to the track or go extremely fast on highways, you get the circuit spec, and so on. What's nice is that you only buy one Challenger, and as you progress through the game, you get it in each spec, so you technically have 5 Challengers.NEUTRAL:The Police - I always enjoy it when there is law enforcement in an open-world racing game. At this point, I think it should be mandatory. The Crew, of course, has police, but they are only decent. Nothing more and nothing less. Unfortunately, this is where Need for Speed does something better than The Crew. During a police chase, even with 5 stars, there will never be any more than 5 police cars at once pursuing you, which by the way, are quite easy to take out. The roadblocks are laughable, since they never use anything other than the cars that are pursuing you to block the road, so you can usually speed right through them, unlike NFS: Most Wanted, which eventually has SWAT trucks that basically force you to take another route. There are also no spike strips. While it still can be fun to get into chases and have a friend taking out cops for you, I believe it could be made significantly harder at 5 stars with the use of bigger vehicles and spike strips.Customization - I'm very thankful that The Crew actually has customization to begin with, but it is really lacking. For one, you cannot choose from any color in the spectrum; you just pick from a preset list of colors. Second, the decals are mostly terrible. I tend to use the same 10-15 decals on most cars, or sometimes not at all, because most of the others are just bad looking and don't seem to fit any vehicle. Granted, that is personal preference, but for someone who has played NFS:Most Wanted and Underground 2, those are far superior in customizing.CONS:Uplay - I think you saw this coming. I know I did. Uplay is a requirement for The Crew, even if you buy it directly from Steam. You must download Uplay, and you must create an account. Although it can run in the background for the most part, the matter of the fact is that it is extra DRM that no one really wants, especially someone like me that only has 1 Ubisoft game. It also contributes to a longer startup time.The Story - Full of clichés and it being overall boring, the story is pretty much mandatory in order to reach level 50. The movie-like cutscenes in it are neat, but if you are like me, you'll do the story just to get it out of the way. The fun seems to come after it's over with.Smart Loot - This system is possibly the worst addition to The Crew since launch. Granted, before it was added, people still complained about the grinding system for leveling up your vehicle. Now, however, it is much, much worse. Instead of what used to be a much quicker, platinum only part grind where you could go up as much as +50 spec points in a single jump, is now down to as little as +1 for the same skills. Not to mention you also have a chance of winning a customization part, such as paint, or a bumper. This makes it very hard to get your car to 1299 (the max spec level), if you weren't a player before Smart Loot was added.Closing ThoughtsDespite some big flaws, I have enjoyed this game a lot, and I would say it's in my top 5 racing games now. The Crew, to me, earns an 8/10. If you can look past the cons listed above, I do recommend this game to any person that enjoys racing games, or is looking to try the genre in general. "

												I bought the game at launch, or a couple days after, here's my takeWHEEL USER'S REVIEW (Sim racer's point of view)The Crew does many things well:-Endless driving across the US-Decent feel through a T500RS (with the extraconfig.xml file you can find through ISR or Racedepartment)-Lenghty game overall-Though dated, looks nice-CarPG-Discoverables-Useable physics for low level cars (preferrably street or dirt specs primarily)However there's major things that this game does NOT do well:-Lateral grip loss (bad for drifting, though drifting isn't impossible)-HIgher level cars get more and more unrealistic, to the point where wheel users won't enjoy-Cops are....well, they don't matter, until they unrealistically and impossibly DO matter out of nowhere-The umpteen amounts of over-the-top ""LOOK AT ME I AM STREET RACORZ"" bling bling-Cut-scenes for every single action-New muffler part;  BRAKING BONUS!!!-Users without Calling All Units have major issues with constant annoyance to buy DLC, as well as friend disappearing when cops give chase, or simply alert that you have a slight bounty against them-Occasional drop-out of co-op missions-Honestly lame sound overallIt's a game I recommend to wheel users but ONLY if you're ok with using only half the content.  For wheel users specifically, once you get cars to a high enough level, or start using the higher specs of tuning, it becomes more and more arcade and unuseable for wheels.  It's not completely useless, but it definitely makes it more bland the more you progress.  The game's FFB (even with extraconfig.xml) strength is determined by vehicle weight, so the lighter the vehicle, the less FFB there is entirely.  Trucks and heavier vehicles naturally have more strength in the wheel overall.The FFB on the GOOD side, is pretty decent.  There's communication going on, and opposite lock (catching slides or drifting) is, in fact, there.  It's redeeming in itself, for a CARPG.On the BAD side, well, I've already mentioned the weight, but on Dirt, those forces nearly double overall.  It's rough on Dirt.  Some might complain due to lack of consistency, some might like it actually.  I kind of like it.The physics are....arcade, with a slight touch of realism.  At the lower levels, cars feel mostly natural.  On the higher levels, they float with total disregard for gravity and grip limits (HANDLING BONUS!!!).  Breaks are way too strong and acceleration is too fast.  The tires spin wildly, trying to impress somebody, yet nothing is happening on the driver's point of view.  Just generic wheel spin.  Still, there's a level of conservation needed to keep yourself from dying.  Snow is more fun to me.  I spent the entire game making sure I got as little HANDLING BONUS!!! BRAKING BONUS!!!....bonus's as possible.The sound is pretty lame.  Cars sound...well decently accurate, at least some.  They aren't terrible, but there's nothing to write home about.  Car engines are quiet overall, there's major leveling issues across the board and I don't play with music either.  Overall, it gets the job done, but don't expect to be wow'ed.  Some cars (namely Nissan Skyline R34) have pitch attenuation issues.Online portion is a dream come true....except for the fact that it's not.  Co-op is an awesome edition and cruising endlessly with friends is TRULY the meat of the game.  However, co-op doesn't mean anything, especially when you convince a friend to buy it so you can play together.  You already have all these tuned up cars that decimate the low level missions while your friend is feeling inadequate.  People disappear every time a cop chase is initiated, or you're alerted that cops are watching for you (or a friend).  Just left with a jittery name tag floating around.  It's annoying.  It works, it's not impressive, the concept is great, implemented rather poorly (but not so bad it's unplayable).  PVP matches are unbalanced, and for a wheel user, is not worth it honestly.  Once you max out your car's level through miscellaneous challenges, it becomes an arcadey mess, completely focused on top speed.Graphics are pretty nice.  There's nothing super amazing or perfect.  I'm running tripple screens and, though it doesn't support all the bells and whistles of simulators, it does have an FOV slider that works well.  I can't complain overall.  Looks pretty good, plays nice with peripherals it seems.Input device support:  I'm running a T500RS with a Basher boards FL2 adapter to run a G27 shifter on a seperate USB.  Works fine.  Took a minute to set it up.  Seems to be fine.  Like I said, I'm running tripples and it adds to the game greatly.  Though it won't quite run maxed with this setup smoothly.  980 4gb i5 3570 with 8GB RAM.Story:  I don't care.  I never will care.  You can't make me.  I've already gone through the NFS underground and beyond stories and I just plain don't care at all.  Well told I suppose, but flashy and stupid all the same.I recommend this game only because, as a wheel user with tripples and stuff, at the lower levels, this game is a great experience.  Endless driving exploration, co-op, driving with friends, just plain screwing around, drifting in Montana, some customization (though slightly limited in a way).  Stock, Street, Dirt, Raid and somewhat, Performance specs are fun to play with.  Beyond that wheel users won't have much fun with the floaty ""super handling/braking"" crap of the lighter cars.  It's fun having a 400hp Fiat 500, blasting away at RUF's and Zonda's like it's nothing.  The extraconfig.xml is absolutely necessary for good FFB overall.  It's hard to recommend otherwise, as there's obvious issues with the overall package, but still, it IS fun.  This is all outside the ""review"" of DLC and other things, which is complete BS overall.  I won't get into details, but DLC ruins some of the experience, unless you have money to throw away and get it all (then you won't have the game constantly pushing you to buy more things, as well as the online portion having less issues as a result).7/10:  Great concept, good open world exploration, bad end game, 50-50 for wheel users (dependant on vehicle class and level), horrible over-the-top-trying-to-impress-you fan service.

												It's a bloody mess.I have to admit that I fell for the ""we'll listen to the community feedback"" lie, genuinely thinking that this game would go in the right direction.But it didn't. It went straight into a DLCfest.The season pass doesn't grant you access to all the paid content, Wildrun isn't part of it, and on top of that, it costs almost as much as the game itself.Plus, it gives so little content that it makes no sense to pay that much: a bunch of bikes, new specs made with recycled and/or slightly edited assets and a new gamemode which should be competitive, but in reality it's just about who glitches the most.The physics are broken, the cars don't feel alright at all. The steering capabilities also differ depending on input peripheral, with DirectInput ones having increased precision and steering radius, while keyboard and Xinput pads users get impaired controls. This issue hasn't been fixed, despite being a hot topic on the game's forums.Vehicles aren't many for today's standards and they're terribly unbalanced. While updates fix the handling of some cars, all they do is changing the current kings. On top of that, bikes seem to dominate in almost any spec and they're locked behind a paywall. Despite the major outcry on the forums for more balance, nothing seems to have changed yet. Moreover, the engine sounds are terrible.The only saving graces of this game are the graphics and the game world.			"

												Although i don't have as much playtime on this as some others, there is a lot to be said about the first impression of the game. Pros:Maps are richly detailed, i actually had to turn down settings so it wouldn't lag as much.Cars are nicely detailed, drivers side view allows you to look from side to side just like in real life.Good number of players aroundRacing is fun, although this has its own mechanics and an entirely arcade feel. It essentially feels like an early NFS title in how it handles. Think Underground 2 or Hot Pursuit 2.Cons: Glitchy! Sometimes you can ram a car hard, and the game will act like it was just a scratch, other times you will tap a car on the side lightly, and crash as if you rammed them. Speed of hit does not seem to matter.Microtransactions : YES, this does have microtransactions, although i do not see the need to buy cash unless you want to progress faster. It isn't quite as bad as i have seen in many games with a pay2win aspect. Not worth the base value. I waited for this to go on sale, do not buy this at full price. I don't think this is worth $60 let alone $85 for the Gold. Uplay: You must log in via Ubisoft's Uplay platform seperatly or make an account with them. Hackers and Griefers: Don't bother with the leaderboards.Handling: Normal racing mechanics do not seem to apply in this game. If you can get past the cons, there is some fun to be had in exploring and doing missions. Personally, i enjoy what i have played so far. Get it on sale.			"

												Game is shoddy at best. Another blatant cash grab by Ubisoft. Ubisoft deserves to go bankrupt at this point. I would be okay with this game if it weren't for the process used to level up your cars. You need to do challenges to gain better parts, but the reward system is an ubelievable level of stupid. Rewards are randomized so it doesn't matter if you barely scraped out a platinum or absolutley crushed the challenges. What you're gonna get is complete chance. It'd be like going into work on payday and getting payed the exact same as that ♥♥♥♥♥ Debrah from accounting, you know the ♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't do any of the work, ♥♥♥♥s around in the break room for hours at a time, yet still gets payed exactly the same. This game reminds me of Debrah. You remember when you were a kid and you wanted your Dad to read you a bedtime story and he was all like ""Not now I just got home from work,""? But you kept pestering him until he agreed and then when he read it it was like ""Mary had a little lamb. The end."" That's what this story is like. In short, I'd rather have a dart frog ejaculate his venomous♥♥♥♥♥into my ear canal than play anymore of this game.			"

												I highly reccomend this game just from playing the closed beta! It really feels like Test Drive Unlimited on steriods(which is good, because some of the original TDU devs worked on this game!). You get a good selection of radio channels, including a fantastic classical station, and a full interior view in beautiful detail. The world is obviously not a 1:1 scale of the US, but it is still immense, and you really can't get bored with this game from just driving around. Instead of TDU, where you just drive around Hawaii and look at pretty palm trees, this game has vast deserts, snowy mountains, and sprawling cities. I got to Las Vegas, and I was amazed by how much thought was put into the city's design. It is almost like the devs actually cared about making the game feel as good as possible. As of yet, I cannot speak of the car selection very much, but it seems like it shouldn't be too lousy. If you like open world games, or just want to see the good ol' USA, buy this now!			"

												Ubisoft is even worse then EA. So, let me explain: The game itself cost 30 bucks, then you must pay 25 more dollars to get the DLC cars, AND THEN (yeah, thats not it) you must pay about 40 more ""greens"" to get another half of the game, with many new cars, game-changing specs of the cars, and many-many things. That half of the game named ""The Wild Run"", which is a DLC, coming pretty soon to the market. So, after some simple calculations we get a FULL game for about 90 bucks! Great job Ubisoft!Now about the game itself. Yes its kinda good, but after you drove a little, completed the story mode, got EVERY car in the game in EVERY spec, drove the whole map, discovered tons of the bugs, like wall-breach and go-underwater bug, some skill races in top-50, you got basically nothing left to do.So the conclusion, should you buy it or not.Well, there is a litteraly a few people, like me, who can truly love it and fall into addiction, who think that the freeroam, huge map and 72 cars is enough (though i never felt like there is so much, and was actually shocked when i got that fact, as the cars feel pretty much similiar). If you want to risk, as its CAN be on of your favourite games, go ahead and buy ""Trial"" version for just 30 USD, and then decide if you ready to pay same to fall into that game for some hours more.

												The Crew has quickly become my favorite racing game ever. Let me first qualify by saying that I am not a racing sim fan but prefer arcade-style racers. Previous favorites have been Burnout: Paradise and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage. I also enjoy the DIRT and Forza series of games. With that said The Crew has an engaging story with a cinematic feel. I was able to play through the story at a casual pace in about 15 hours. The cut scenes are very well done and really draw you in. Once you finish the story there really isn't much that ties the campaign to the rest of the game however. I hope Ivory Tower (the developer) finds a way to create new missions which allow you to see what Alex and the 5-10s are doing instead of the player just running around the US doing races that don't connect with the story.Other than the disconnect from the story, once you make it to ""V8"" status then the open world really affords you many choices. In addition to the option to go back and re-race any of the campaign missions (to win better car parts) you can also run skill events. You must do wither of these to get better parts for your car(s) before you will have a chance in the PvP section. You can also race in Faction events which earn bucks that you can use to repurchase parts you have already won for cars you haven't yet upgraded or to buy entirely new cars.Speaking of cars, The Crew actually uses licensed cars from a wide variety of car makers including domestic and foriegn. Most of the cars are available to purchase with the bucks you earn in the game but others are only available if you pay real cash. The cost is relatively low and the season pass can make them even more affordable to buy all together. Each car has a variety of ""spec"" ratings from Full-stock, Street, Performance, Dirt, Raid and Circuit. Not all cars support all specs such as a Ferrari wouldn't have Dirt or Raid but many such as the Mustang GT have all so you can get really crazy with your builds. You can also customize the exterior and interior appearance of your rides and with the daily and monthly challenges you are encouraged to enhance your cars to earn more bucks. The variety of car looks and builds is pretty amazing. I rarely see the same configurations more than once when playing PvP.I could go on and on about this game but one of the things I like the most is that the developer, Ivory Tower, keeps enhancing and updating the game to make it better. Recently that added a league rating system and they routinely release new cars, tracks and events. The fact that this game continues to grow really makes it a great value. Unlike my past favorites I am always able to discover new things in this vast vehicular playground. Whether you buy The Crew on sale or at regular price you won't be dissappointed. This is one of the most fun and engaging racing games ever.Oh and did I say that there is a huge expansion coming in the fall: Monster Trucks, Motorcycles and Dragsters!!!!			"

Posted: January 25, 2015
												I've always been a fan of racing games. Doesn't matter what type or style it entailed. The Crew has its good and its bad. Lets go with the bad first.The only real negatives I can personally give is once you hit level 50 and can get Platinum level cart parts it's a straight crap shoot at getting a level 50 car part. This is my biggest complaint. It's purely random, meaning you might get it on the first try or not get it for fifty tries or more. Also on the car parts that you ""unlock"", which allows you to buy the car part on another car instead of having to Story/Skills missions for the same part is restricted to which car spec you use when you unlocked that car part so if you get it through a Street spec car you can only buy it on a Street spec car, Any other car spec you will have to unlock seperately.The car assists are split into three types, all assist, sport, and hardcore. None of which can be changed for what you want or don't want when driving. This is mildly annoying, but it also knows if you're using a controller or a steering wheel. Avoid using a keyboard if all possible with this game.The NPC cars in Faction missions and the Police are cheaters, to put it as nice as possible, since it doesn't matter what surface they're driving on they will never lose any traction. The Police are lacking in the sense of you can drive by them at ridiculous speeds and run red lights/stop signs and they do not attempt to chase you. The only way to get a police chase is to either run into them or cause enough collateral damage during a Police Watch to trigger them into chasing you. Maybe this can be patched later to make them more like actual cops.The car selection is nice, it isn't on Gran Turismo or Forza level, but it's sufficient. Overall the customization isn't bad either. Visual car aestetics are fairly wide until you get to Raid and Circuit specs (Since they are only color, sticker, tag, and rims options.) Again it isn't at the level of being able to make your own designs and putting them on your car. (I know why, mostly in the sense of people making poorly designed gentailia...) There are enough stickers and color variety to not run into same design, unless everyone in your session is obsessed with The Fast & the Furious.The achievements can be entertaining in their title and down right fun to do depending on the prerequistes.This game isn't for the simulator type player, it plays more to your Test Drive, Need for Speed and Burnout types. Even the adventerer in you will find it fun to be able to drive across the United States finding known landmarks throughout. The story isn't anything new, but it was still fun to watch and have some sort of cinematics and build some level of character developement for the people you add to your crew over the course of your exploits.Oh, make sure you have some friends too, this is far more fun with people you know than driving it alone. At the end of the opening credits it says, ""Never Drive Alone"" and for good reason. Despite the flaws in this game I still see more posistive than negative, but what do I know since I'm the same guy that's been playing APB/APB:R for 3+ years. :)			"

Истории гонок не было такого окружающее пространство без предзагрузки локаций :) Игра не даст оторваться ни на минуту где можно с друзьями весело и приятно провести время, участвуя в различных видах гонок или сможешь соперничать с различными игроками со всего мира, а можно просто покататься по штатам посмотреть достопримечательности здесь их хватает. Если ты жить не можешь без ежедневной порции драйва, тебя бесплатно перенесут в мир, где царствуют азарт и скорость. Советую поиграть всем!Моя оценка: 10/10 "

												The Crew is the 2014 textbook definition of polarizing, even before it released. On the one hand, it is an open-world racing game, giving you the opportunity to drive from one end of the United States to the other. On the other hand, Ubisoft.This polarization extends in-game as well. One minute, I could be screaming at the screen because I failed a raid mission for the fifteenth time: My car had forgotten how it was supposed to work and a tiny rock about two pixels in size sent it careening sideways into fifteen trees like the world's worst lumberjack. The next, I would be driving through the snowy Rockies with the sun shining on my face as I drifted through a corner, pondering whether it was possible to operate the steering wheel with my massive erection.It's a beautiful game with an adequate roster of cars (58 cars including Season Pass, possibly more to come) and wonky physics and I've loved every second of it.

												I do like this game but there are still way to many things to fix. Cop AI isn't very bright, but when they are driving on your sides, you're screwed. There is no way out of that the cop cruisers refuse to move, not like a car would act normally.Also the difficulty for some missions is so artificial its angering. Most of the time, your car level needs to be well over the recomemded level because there are always 1-2 cars that just fly ahead of you and stay ahead of you. Also i noticed when a friend of a much higher level helps a much lower, the opposing racers are on par with the high level friend. Wait what?! At this point the lower level is better off on his own. The opposing AI car levels still have a low number but match speed with the high level pretty much throughout the whole race.I know the big map is great and all, but its not 20 miles from Miami to Chicago. At least make it more reasonable.Amidst all this backlash, I still recomend this game. For those who play it like a game not like something of a speed run. Which is what about half of the other people are complaining about.			"

												I beta tested the game on the PC 2ed beta  for a few hours and it has improved from that. I have just finished getting to level 50 (max) and played through the whole story.The problems with this game are:You have to be connected to the server to playReally??? Is their a time when you wont have the internet and still be able to run this game because most laptops will not run this game and the data rates are low enough.Extreme rubber banding AIThe AI can be pretty easily fixed because it was already fine in the beta so all they have to do is find a balance between the beta and the official game  AI.server issues Well it is only day 2 now so you can expect to see improvements soonMISSING VEHICLES AND SPECS THAT WERE IN THE BETA!I don't even know?! How can you have more cars and specs for them and not put in your official launch game when they were in the BETA! THIS BETTER NOT BE A PLOY TO GET MORE DLC INTO THE GAME! I am hopeful that their were issues with them and they will be adding them in the game (FOR FREE) when the time comes.  Maybe handling issues!?!I say this because I don't think players understand how these vehicles work. Full stock= Slidey Street= Not as slidey and fasterDirt = Slower made for trails/driftyPerformance= Gripey 2ed fastest highway/streetRaid= trucks that raid any where and are slowestCircuit= Grip mobile fastest highway/flat roads with some twistsYou see alot of people only had access to level 10 in the beta witch is only the top 3 specs and they were saying it was like ""driving on ice"" Each car handles different in the different spec and each spec has their own general handling so their is a lot of leeway in how the cars handle, not to mention the small upgrades for the vehicles in game that affect handling. Having played lots of racing games (simulator/arcade) it is defntly more toward the arcade side but it does have a wide range of different types oF driving. These are the most persistent and worst issues of the game but all of it can be fixed through patches and updates, only time will tell if they will attempt to fix these issues.The good?Map beautiful and  huge with fast travel to anywhere you have been NEAR !A good selection of vehicles just not a huge spectrum (needs companies like DMC, Tesla, Hennessy and a few others that are part of American history (THE GAME IS ABOUT AMERICA more American cars please!) ) All kinds of exploring4 player/ multi-player Free content updatesCurrently 48 vehicles with different specs for each (HOPEFUL MORE WITH UPDATES AND NOT DLC AS THEIR IS ALREADY TO MUCH DLC)This game works well with wheels (Has used the logitech driving force gt (was $120 new) for the whole playthrough but I recomend the logitech g27 if you can afford it $200)etc. Those of you that this is more of a money issue i would just wait untill its on sale but if you like mixed racers want to explore with friends or new people and have the pc to run this game well, get it. I enjoy the game for what it is worth and I hope that if you do buy it you enjoy it as well.  $ 85 (game+dlc) is a lot for a title I just hope my purchase and hopes were not misplaced.oh and uplay still sucks and it always will!

												So after Eurogamer.net gave it a 8/10, I decided to give the game ago with a buddy of mine. Holy crap I did not expact to have this much fun.  First things first, the game is an arcade racer. Don't expect anything along the lines of Gran Turismo et al. The game handles like ye'olde typical arcade game. Honestly, that is a good thing. I have Asetto Corsa to fill the enthusiast needs. It has been quite a while since I've enjode an arcade racer. Actually, the last time I remember having this much fun was with ""Ultim@te Race"".  I am only a few hourse in, so here is why I like the game in a nutshell:1. Pretty/adequate graphics. 2. Runs like butter. Fast 60fps no stutters,,,,nuttin. Considering how bad Unity and Watch Dogs was I am pleasantly surprised. 3. Huge game world , which means while you do the typical race activities, the tracks are diverse and fresh.4. The coop is fun. Just plain fun. 5. The RPG like mechanics keep you going in a ""just on more upgrade"" kinda way. It is fun to see all those players driving around you all the time. Makes the world feel alive. This game is certainly not for everyone, but if you, like me, just want to play an arcade racer with your buddies.....then give it a try....at least when it is on sale.  So far I am not regretting paying full price though.That being said, I did loose connection with the servers once every hour. Which is a minor annoyance.			"

												THIS GAME IS SO HUGE!the map, not the game's size.Really, this game is awesomely done. Almost all of the cities in US is inside this game (i don't know, i'm not live in US though :/). But really, this game have L.A. Las Vegas, Chicago, Boston, Miami, The snowy mountain, the swamp places, all in real distance between cities. This game is really wow but i don't know why it has a mixed review...Well the cars. it has 70-ish cars in this game (i guess, with dlc) with 5 customs; Street, Dirt, Raid, Performance, and Circuit. But to collect money is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because it's a bit hard collect money and everything to buy new cars and upgrade it. but thank god the game system is something like Leveling thing (like RPG Games). So every car has their own levels. there're challenges in the world (US) and it's repeatable. everytime you finish in Platinum (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum), you get an upgrade for your car.As for gameplay, like i mentioned above, this game is a casual racing game, in a leveling gameplay. it's fun though, you can with 4 of your friends, completing missions together. race in PvP against other crew, or only with your friends. AND. This race. Where the race is point to point, and the race can take up to 2 hours. is like a race from Los Angeles to New York, Las Vegas to Miami, Chicago to San Francisco etc. it's really awesome!The missions in here is a story but it's good story too though you guys should check it out			"

												The Crew is a very fun game, spiritual successor to Test Drive Unlimited 1 and 2. A very unique racing game. You're given some missions, money and access to a ton of cars where you can freely drive around a giant open world with a lot of variation. You have snowy area's complete with a lack of grip, the Nevada desert and the urban areas of NYC. All this while meeting a ton of players along the way which make roadtrips very fun. However, there are definite downsides. The game is pretty arcadey, steering wheel support is not that good, there's some really weird things. For example: bikes can push cars out of the way. All in all I'd still recommend the game for it is truly a unique game.			"

												Overall it's quite a decent driving game, good fun. Except that collision boxes on NPC vehicles are rather broken...And that the NPCs have to be the stupidest drivers ever, they don't exactly move out of the way (I think theyre fixed on rails until something hits them)...And that you lose connection to the servers a lot...And that there's a bug where you can't see people in your crew when their nametag is right next to you...And that an NPC police car can go faster than a McLaren 12C doing 250mph...But its made by Ubisoft so what did you expect? Oh and also it's a complete rip off on Steam (psst use an external site, you can get it for 6quid *wink*)But to be perfectly honest if you don't mind a few problems here and there it's a decent driving game. Having full customisation on your vehicles is brilliant, earning money is pretty easy, and actually has a pretty decent story line.Graphically it's brilliant, full max settings at 1080p (16x AA etc.) on a gtx1060 6GB it never drops below 60FPS.Gonna give it a 7.5/10, the good parts outweigh the bad, would recommend.

												Haven't beaten the game yet, but so far I really enjoy it. Since I upgraded my CPU to an i5 4690, I no longer stutter and lag which makes it extremely enjoyable. The world is beautiful, the cars are beautiful, the mechanics are, ok, arcade-y or not realistic, but that's ok. If I wanted to play a simulator I'd do that. I really like the huge world aspect, it makes the game much more interesting to explore and drive around on. Only complaints I have are the confusing methods to upgrade and decorate your car. It took me hours to figure out how to simply change the paint on my car, and where to go to get upgrades or visual changes. I also wish I could get much cooler cars sooner, like Ferrari's, Lambo's, etc. For now I'm still stuck with the Nissan for 10 hours, whereas in NFS Rivals I could afford a top of the line car by 10 hours. Anyway, pretty fun game, and I'll probably get the Calling All Units DLC this November!			"

												TL;DR - I'd recommend picking it up when it goes on sale or if you know you've got friends to play it with, as the campagin is hopelessly short and there's not much endgame content without the Wild Run DLC. Still incredibly enjoyable if you like cars, exploration, or customization. -Cars. There's a lot of them, a wide variety of real life brands, and there's some pretty extensive visual customization for almost all of them.-Microtransactions exsist, but almost all of them are shortcuts that you can eventually reach in the base game, or are simply visual components. -It's always online, but I've never experienced any server difficulties. - Geography is completely boned up, but many of the cities or landscapes capture the essence of the town they smulate. Someone living in San Francisco won't recognize many streets, but it still feels like the city.- Game sometimes can seem empty. Civilian foot traffic is low in cities, and occasionally traffic is sparse.-Devlopers are still actively involved and relasing content, so that's pretty cool. The storyline is the video game equivalent of a wet piece of toast - bland, uninspiring, and so generic that you completely forget about it. There's some pretty cringey dialogue, some pretty bad voice acting, and your protagonist is an unrelatable walking cliche. Once you hit the cap of level 50, it's a short MMO-style grind to max out your car, and then it seems like you're done with the game.This is when the Wild Run DLC becomes a lfiesaver. It introduces weekly and monthly challenges against other people, inspiring you to come back again and again. It adds real end game content, and I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is very fun and will take away many hours of your life.I don't know if this is just me but I would like every car to behave and cost as much as the car does in real life. For example, the Bentley Conitinental Supersports accelerated from 0-60 in 3.4 seconds in real life, but in the game its only 4 seconds.Also one thing I really dislike is that when there is a 2 part mission, if you start it complete the first part and fail the second part, then exit the mission entireley you cannot restart from the part that you left off. This game is very good but needs some  mandatory tweaks "

												I expected better of you, Ubisoft. I'm going to have to give a thumbs down for this game, and I doubt you'll ever see another penny coming out of me for your incompetence for a horrendous buisness practice (in-game cash shop after buying an AAA title game) and trying to force everyone to use your bad game launcher (UPLAY)I bought the game being hyped when everyone saw the amazing CGI Cinematic Trailer The Crew showed off when it was first released on youtube, everyone really thought we were gonna have fun, join together as one with a Crew, with those being huge in the car culture, the trailer really represented us gamers what we really wanted and expected out of The Crew, to no avail tho the game itself was not like the trailer... sadly.The Game was okay at the time, bought the gold edition that included seasons pass and had unlocked most of the sweet cars, seemed like a sweet deal. Despite the fact that the CGI Trailer was no where near close to how the game itself really was, The Crew was overall a game that had more pro's than cons at the time of it's releaseUbisoft then decided to be money hungry, and not only did they change the way how end game worked by reducing the chances of farming rare parts through skills (pushing for people to buy in-game currency and or pvp for them (again low chance), and ADDED a DLC which was not INCLUDED IN A SEASON'S PASS (which I also bought) and the DLC didn't contribute to anything that The Crew was at first, it didn't even make me want to come back to the game, all they did was add a competitive content that had barely ANY interactions between players, a bunch of monster trucks and motocycles that had basically nothing to do with the game as well. Drifting was a nice addition and was probably the only good thing out of the DLC, Drag racing was somewhat of a pointless feature in the game.All in all with current status of this game.The Crew is now in my opinion one of the worst car racing MMOs to date with the recent updates. I have to say.. Good job Ubisoft you finally surpassed EA in being the worst publisher and game developer ever existed in the gaming industry, it's like you ACTUALLY WANTED recognition for it and♥♥♥♥♥♥people off with your half made games that aren't even complete, even your game launcher is WORSE than Origin. JUST HOW can you not learn from your mistakes?Again, not one penny out of me until I see things improve with you guys.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but Ubisoft announced a large expansion for this at e3 today and I want to see them continue that kind of support. My initinal impression: 7/10My current thoughts: 9/10My cousin and I preordered this game and started playing it as soon as it was released. I'll be honest, it's not what I expected at all. I was hoping for another Test Drive Unlimited, so for the first while playing it I didn't like it much. We ended up stopping for three months before picking it up again and now it is one of my favorite games. They've made a lot of changes and fixed a lot of things, but I also like the game for what it is now, not what I wanted it to be. I've spent hours just driving aimlessly to see what I can find, more than half the time I'm not even on a road, I'm using a RAID spec vehicle (think offroad racing truck type of vehicle) to drive where there aren't even roads because the team even put detail into those parts of the map.Speaking of Specs, that's what makes this game so cool. Currently, I am using a 1969 Camaro for all races. I have a version that is basically an offroad buggy meant for driving where there aren't roads, another that is a high-performance circuit racer, a street racing version, a dirt track version, and a NFS-type high-performance street race version. The same car becomes 5 VASTLY different cars, each handling differently and meant for different types of races and terrains. You simply can't drive a Circuit car in a RAID race, that'd be like driving a formula one car in a rally, it just doesn't work. The same is true vice versa. But you can use the same car as both specs if you want.The story mode is pointless, I won't disagree with that, but this game is meant to be an MMO, the story doesn't really matter. It's only there to introduce you to the different specs for PVP events. It is still fun with a crew of course, but pretty boring by yourself. My cousin and I never even finished it. We got as far as unlocking the last SPEC and then focused on PVP events and faction events. PVP events and faction events are what's the most fun. They are races of all types across the US. My favorite race is a RAID race going down the side of a snowy mountain, it's high speed and there are no roads. Faction events can vary in length between less than 10 minutes to over an hour. That seems crazy at first but with a crew it is fun. The entire map is covered with challenges like speed, escape, jump, raceline, etc. to get upgrades for your car like loot drops in an MMO. It's a great way to keep just driving interesting as well. But most of the time you will probably avoid them if you're just driving because really, this game makes just driving feel great.I'm looking forward to what is planned to be added to this game, they said they will support it for a long time and I really hope so. This is the kind of game you can drive for hours without even doing anything and still enjoy yourself, whether or not there is even a road in visible distance of you.			"

												If you are a fan of cars and racing games definitely pick this up. The handling seems a little arcadey and needs to be adjusted a bit in the settings and of course like all racing games a controller is always nice. But honestly the game will give you hours of fun upgrading your favorite cars, testing you skills in pvp or on solo/crew missions, and roaming around a toned down map of the USA. (with multiple race tracks to find might i add). The only possible downsides is that upgrading the cars can feeling like endless grinding to get the part you want, BUT it really isn't bad, also that the cop chases are pretty sub-par and lastly you need uplay.Closing note about the negative reviews:Most seem to be about the difficulty of the game and how some missions might need multiple people. Honestly all I have to say about the difficulty is git gud :p I had no problem with the game at all (not to mention a little challenge is always fun!)  and in terms of the missions that may need multiple people, there is an option before the mission inviting all people that you can see to help you, so finding multiple people is easy!Please do not let the negative reviews put you off from this game and remember to read them carefully!

												The Crew. A game that I'd followed for a fair few months before its BETA release, and then jumped off the train to ""buyingit-ville"" very shortly before release. For another 8 months I fondled with the idea of buying it, but never did. I didn't really know why... until now.Now, before I start, I should clarify that no, I didn't ""thumbs it up"" by mistake. I bought this game on sale for £12 and I feel it's worth that. But a penny more? No.An open world, multi-purpose racing game with vast amounts of custimization that is also an MMO. Sounds great, right? Let me further clarify those for you.Open World...and then some. Oh boy, the map's huge! I always thought GTA V's map was big, but this must be at least 4x the size of Los Santos. Not only is it big, based around the entirety of the USA and time-consuming to travel across, but it's also incredibly detailed. The sale price was worth it for the gametime on that map alone. Even without missions, it would still be enjoyable for me. You might want to get a plane if you're going from NY to LA though.Multi Purpose Racing/CustomizationYou betcha! Dirt, Raid, Perf(ormance), Street and Circuit specs will make sure that you definitely have the right tool for the job (or the race, in this case)! The car detailing with these specs is very nice. Cars look crisp, although some more than others, for some reason, and there's a lot to do in the customization front (bumpers, fenders etc.).The A.I. however is a joke. It would seem that Ubisoft believe that you should have to hard brake around track corners in a specially circuit-tuned race car that should turn on a dime, only to fall off track and lose your first place position to the guy in last 1 mile back. But, the guy behind you in a Chevy V8, with tyres the size of a standard London road-lane and the turning circle of a cruise ship? Oh, no trouble there! In fact, they don't have to even brake! Their car has high-performance, rubberised glue... apparently. Oh, and if you can actually manage to pull off a first place medal against the sling-shotting A.I., don't expect it to be gold. You're going to need a harrier jet for that. Available in the new DLC , which you'll be able to grab in your nearest showroom for the low, low price of £25.M.M.OHa! Yeah right. I haven't played W.O.W in a few years, but unless their servers have changed to allowing a whopping 8 players in one match(!), then it is an insult to even put this into the same category.ConclusionIt's a fun game. Has a lot of bugs but a lot of them are rarely noticable. It's a great time-waster and the cars look good, especially when you put a big ol' body kit on 'em. Buy it, but don't pay full price for it, even if that is only £25. Also, be prepared for a ton of in-game currency being thrown in your face. Seriously, it's like hitting a wasps nest with a baseball bat; overwhelming and really, really stupid.			"

												Half of the review are about they stealing your money, that's right, but who is not? Just look around... The game is short yea, cuz you played the story... Haven't played multiplayer, or with friends, there is 1, 2 hours fraction missions... without stop! NFS WORLD somebody? It's not the same but at least has a feeling like it.  Lot of bad review I don't know why, If it's expensive for you why did you buy it? I want the Season pass and The Wild Run DLC soooo baaad, but i WAIT for the SALE... Blame the game because it's expensive, can't wait for the sale or what? I'm just disapointed in ppl.. Seriously, yea the game doesn't have proper physics, somebody said SIM? Nope... Doesn't have enough JDM and what? I drive then the new Muscle cars, I don't like them much, so what? What's your problem ppl?... Tell me, can't write the steam code in you play, and think they gave you trial version? You gave a bad review because they didn't tell you to write it there? Oh STEAM always does, before you start the game Mr. Gaben loves you.. but you just skip the window cuz why not... Hi there! :)I'm trying to be short as I can!I see NFS ppl! Cry for money maybe you can buy The Crew DLC I played NFS World for a while, really loved that game but EA stopped it (later i'm going to get back to this point). I was really doubtful about the Crew, my bro in law got in on Xbox one, the game was really ugly so I didn't planned to buy the game for a while, checked reviews it got worse I didn't want the game at all. I wanted to play a car game with my friend so we figured out we don't have a big selection. (Open world games) Tell me if I'm wrong. Got NFS 15'' on PC finished the game and it wasn't bad, gave me a little old NFS feeling like  05'MW. Now EA told the players we are getting updates etc. We got 1 medium update and 2 small. Then they told us that's it. I mean c'mon, they could told us , the game is a Demo... -.- New game coming in 17.. I compare The Crew to the NFS, why, because that was an open world sandbox game, yes there is Forza Horizon 2 on Consoles, but not on PC yet. Why is the crew better: Much less loading time, openworld(but it's not a small session), Tuning system(you are able to see the running parts), Cockpit cam, More updates (costs money but they take care of the game, not throwing it away), Whole US map which is pretty big(cruise without any loading time), Fun play tracks, Bikes, Dirt, Peoples on the street (like in MC LA remix), Fun events where you can get a car parts, league system, Fast n Furious sim.  * I'm still playing the game.*Good	  Loading time!  Fun with friends  Fast n Furious sim!  Large map  Small events  Day night weather cycle  Developer active  Different setup cars  Body tuning   Traffic, Peoples on the streets  Crowd scaring mustangs! :D  Show how many miles, kmeters driven. (it's cool i think) Perks,   Police chases   Many real places, racing tracks, GPS  Drag in the desert  Infinite garage space  Mobile garage/tuner  Leagues/rank/Fractions  Montly big challenges/1 2 hour long missions (without stop)  Manual transmission  If you unlock, or buy the part(Rims etc), you going to have it forever. Bad   Visual tuning, bad rice vinyls, expensive  Graphics (I wouldn't say bad but to compare to other games it's not the best, but I love it, low loading time, smooth play  Few glitches, everybody cries about these, have you tried NFS 15? When u are fallig through the map, in the longest race, sometimes you have to stop not fall through and wait for the map load... Yea these glitches are nothing, stop crying!   Physics are bad, Fast n Furious 4ever!   Not enough cars (  missing JDM  and M3 GTR :D) Few small missions are really hard, I mean just unfair sometimes.  DLC's little bit overpriced, have to wait for sale.   Boring music, you can fix it with old NFS tracks! :D   Silent engine sound (maybe fixed in dlc, i don't know yet)  RUF , what's the matter with Porches? I mean the same just sport ed... Lot of people crying about they are going for money with all the DLC's, you know what, I rather pay extra money for extra stuff than, 3 dlc's and the game is thrown away... Fine they are overpriced a little bit, but they are spending time to make it I don't mind, I don't have the Wild Run dlc yet, waiting for summer sale! :)At the beginning I was negative about the game, not it Turned to love, If you  were an old NFS World player I can offer the game for you, it's pretty good, RIP NFS W! Worth to BUY it ON SALE,Overall score 7.5/10 "

												I really like this game, and i see people comparing The Crew with TDU2 (Test Drive Unlimited 2) and these are not compareble because they are very, very different. The Crew is about your crew, its about exploring the world, its about driving your fully tuned circuit spec through the desert at 400+ km/h. Its about the community, beating records, driving together and completing insane faction races. But it is sertainly not without flaws, the AI is either the best driver ever completely ignoring the laws of physics like not needing to brake and drive 300+km/h through a 90 degree corner, or it will drive into every car and object available.Cons and prosCons:- Bad/unpredictable/unreliable AI- Few cars and brands- Bugs causing the game to crash (example: while browsing your collection theres a high chance of crashing)- Uplay (Let us choose between steam or Uplay)- Can be extremely difficult due to AI- And some minor stuff like: no big rewardsPros:- Great handling cars (trucks vs muscle vs sport cars etc feel very different)- Great graphics (though there's a bit too much lensflare sometimes)- Amazing attention to detail, lots of npc's and wildlife- Massive world to explore- Lots of stuff to do when you're not running through the campain- Different types of vehicle specs- Random moments which make you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥of with your friendsIf i were to rate it i'd give it 8/10.Even though there are bugs and the AI is a bit weird, its a great and fun game to play with your friendsHint: Ubiflop, if you delive anything less than 6+ cars when you release the dlc, i will nuke your♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

I was quite enjoy the long journey drive, driving across main land of USA. I learnt USA geography from the game.As I mentioned the game is not perfect. What made me drove crazy is the handling. It is really suck! I have upgraded my raid car level to 1100, but I still feel difficult to control the car. The car easily slides to roadside when cornering. The game physics is suck as well. When the car hits the rock, just small rock, the car jump. ~_~# !  I was once noticed the AI opponent drove into river but suddenly appeared in front of my car  few seconds later. Anyway, The Crew, for me is still a good game. I will recommend to my friends. "

												If you liked TDU or TDU2, you'll like this. It's essentially TDU2.5; i.e. flawed, but still the most ambitious open world racing available. It's just plain fun.GOOD. The world alone makes this game easily worth the asking price. The open world is AAA, the best in a racer to date, capturing a lot of diversity and the feeling of cruising in a big open-world. You might expect cities, highways, beaches, snow covered mountains, forrest trails, canyons, and (sadly only a few) in-world racetracks. But you're still likely to be surprised by the diversity here; swamps, dunes, salt flats, etc. The Crew's world is just a fun place to drive.NOTSOMUCH. It's always online, which I might like just to reduce cheating, but requiring always online and not providing dedicated servers seems janky. One poorly connected player can effectively pause a race on and off through the whole race. Running into random players in the world is a core concept that I like, but again, poor implementation means the open world is VERY sparsley populated. I'm hoping they can fix this, but as it is, one of the biggest features in the game feels half-arsed.Handling is on par with the TDU series - a better feel than full on cartoony arcade stuff like Burnout, but still very much (too much) cartoon racing. Also, the story is pretty cliche. But seriously, who cares about that in a racer?Some things fall short of what this team pulled off in the TDU series. The great weather and bouncy baja-esque mountain roads from TDU2 are gone. No motorcycles. The car selection is mediocre at best. And the ability to instantly challenge other players is missing.BOTTOM LINE. I'm still hoping for a talented developer with a serious budget to release a racing world like this with proper handling and a more polished take on seemlessly-integrated multiplayer. Until that happens, I guess this is as good as open world racing gets for now.			"

												So after reading some of the top reviews for this game I want to throw in my 2 cents.IS DIS A SIM RACUR?No, the driving mechanic is very realistic, but it is very much an arcade racer, don't knock it for not being a sim when it's not trying to be.AMURICAN UGLEH MUSCLE CARZZ!!!!!211211!!!!The game is kinda based in America though.DA MAP IS SO TINEY!!!1!It took me over two hours in real life to drive across it, and that was the fastest route I could take, no detours.DA STORYLINE IZ bAD!!!!It's a racing game, has any racing game ever had a decent story?I KANT KUSTUMIZE ME CHARACTRYeah, because you can customize the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your carTDU2>CREWLol are you kidding me? And TDU2 had such a GREEEAAAT story. And such a GREEEAT physics engine/handling model. That game was a joke, I'm starting to wonder if people launched that on accident.UBI$OFT MICROTRANSACTIONS HURRRRRREverything you can get from microtransactions is attainable with in game money, obviously DLC cars won't be but almost every game has that even. You can complain about microtransactions all you want, they aren't going away.SURVURS ALWAYZ DOWN!I haven't seen the servers down once and I've been playing since launch day, I also played in the closed beta, never saw it then either.I'm not saying it's a perfect game, I'm saying everyone is expecting a full fledged simulator when The Crew never set out to be that, it's revolutionary in the fact that there are so many different ways to customize your car, street, offroad, etc etc etc. I mean seriously somebody listed no working turn signals as a con, that's so petty. Yeah, the mirrors don't have reflection and some of the shifting animations are fudged, sometimes the character will act like there's a paddle shift and there isn't which leaves him changing gears by swatting the air. As far as I can tell not enough people even use manual transmissions in game to care about shifting animations. Overall this is an incredibly fun game with enough to keep me coming back for a while. I paid full price for it and I don't regret it.EDIT: 12/17I saw the servers go down once a few days ago, they were down for all of 15 minutes. Yeah I was butthurt but it was pretty quick. I'm still enjoying the game but there are a couple more annoyances. PvP is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everybody has full driving assists on and never even has to think, they go careening off walls and guard rails and beat you by 4+ seconds while you're taking care to not hit anything.The factions are odd, there's 5(I think) factions in the game but only 2 or 3 actually have people. I just so happened to put myself on one of the ones with a significant lack of people and it takes me 20+ minutes to find a PvP match for the faction v faction mode. I honestly don't see why they put so many factions in the game.Uplay's ""drivehub"" is showing me news from 1-15-2015 lolEDIT NUMBER 2 12/17I'm gonna try and stop looking at the other reviews for this game, I just saw somebody complain that it is difficult to get a gold medal on challenges. LOL GIT GUD, THERES ALSO PLATINUM MEDALS IF YOU ACTUALLY WOULD PUT MORE THAN 2 HOURS INTO THE GAME. The challenges are exactly what they should be, CHALLENGING. ♥♥♥♥ing hell, you all want to be spoon fed yet you don't like the idea of microtransactions. Speaking of microtransactions, it's not like I can go buy the best parts right off the bat with real life money, I would first have to earn the part with a car, the spend real life money to put it on a TOTALLY DIFFERENT car. So in essence, I'd be spending my money to make another car just as good as one I actually earned the parts with. Yeah you can buy cars outright with real  money but without parts it doesn't matter. People are just being way too critical of this game because Ubisoft. I bet they turn around and call Far Cry 4 GOTY though...Edit 3 1/9So after getting over 120 hours and not seeing myself stopping I thought I'd throw out another update.I've seen the servers down here and there, they're fixed within 20 minutes though.I have one friend who everytime we try to crew up, it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing work, so we have his brother get on and crew us up. (Until they patched that a couple days ago)Ubi announced they're going to fix mirror reflections, I hope you're all happy.First DLC coming out in a week, they'll be keeping that pace for about a year, supposedly.They're also fixing the biggest gripe, the AI chase catchup whatever you want to call it, it's getting patched next week, so basically every review for this game becomes null and void. >Everyone's face when Ubi is listening and patching♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This Game is pretty amazing. A racing game with a pretty decent story. The customization of the cars is fairly profound and fun. Its massive amounts of fun to plaly with friends. The only real issue i have is the cops. They are a little OP. You could have a Corvette maxed out, and they can keep up, and even go faster in generic Sedans. Its not a massive problem but it is annoying. Graphics are great, the driving is realistic but not simulator like. I would recomend this to anyone who loves racing with friends.			"

												I thouroughly enjoyed this game when it was available for the BETA; now I don't.Ubisoft has failed on a majority of its launches this year, this game is not an exception.Off road physics are the worst I have ever seen.Taking out cars is more frustrating than filling out your taxes; the opponent always shoots up to 200 miles an hour when you get within inches of taking them out.The reward system gives bronze for EVERYTHING. All the starting cars are muscle and a Nissan. *Yawn*I picked up the season pass and you can throw a Ferrari into that group. hooray...So far, honestly, the game is not very enjoyable.I do have a few friends to free roam with (the main reason I will keep playing this game) that enjoy it more than I, however, this game was much better during the BETA.

												Overall, the game is fun but it is pretty basic. The story is nothing new but it's nice to have one that isn't crap. The amount of cars is almost embarrasing(at around 35-45) and the ""specs"" don't count as new cars like they want you to think. The sound of the cars are alright but the radio is absolute crap, better off turning it off and making an itunes or youtube playlist of actual good songs. The graphics are alright but pretty bad for how it runs(not too bad for an ubisoft title, if you play far cry 4 on low at 1080p 30fps, you will most likely play on medium at 1080p 25fps in high vegitation, detailed areas, 45 in cities with a good traffic flow, and 60 in bland, emptyish areas).In the end, the story is bland but decent, the cars are good in general, the graphics are disappointing but not as bad as most games(*cough*watchdogs).

												BEFORE I STARTED PLAYING THIS HOW WAS MY FEELING OF THE GAMEim not into car games (maybe cause i suck at them), but had to try the new ""mmo star"" from ubisoft (i dont like ubisoft much as company when it comes to multiplayer and patching, seems like the just fish after wallet money and move to next projekt.) But had to try this oneWHEN I TRIED IT HOW CAN IT BE COMPARED TO THE HYPE I HAD:i had a OK feel, i knew at once i will grow tired of doing the repetetive missions and boring main story. its a game i log into and feel i play alone, like need for speed. I really wanted to like it .TOP 3 I LIKE1. graphics are stunningly beutiful 2. good driving mechanics and lot of stuff to do3. learning curve is easyTOP 3 I DONT LIKE1. repetetive 2. world feels so lonely3. felt the story where very dull.. So overall points by me given are 1/10 where 10 is max.Multiplayer experience: 1/10 (played with a friend in party and not good, also PVP endgame is worthless with ques for 15 min for a round where the best car wins..)Graphics: 10/10Developer update game: 5/10 Developer informing us about their team and state of game: 5/10 IS THE GAME WORTH IT?i have to say NO on this one, since you have to pay a steep price for this ""single player"" game and yet there are micro transactions in it... ohh godits very repetetive and will be forgotten by me fast..

 The Crew Review  This review will contain some stuff i love, like, dislike and hate about The CrewPrepare yourself--- Things I LOVE - The MapThe best map I have EVER seen in a racing game, and not the biggest, but the most diverse map I have EVER played on. It's that good. It would take a large amount of hours to completely explore the map. I still haven't completely expored it in my many hour playtime. It takes about an hour (if you are going very fast) tho get from one side of the map to the other. It just such a fun map to drive around, to take a road trip, and to see all kinds of fabulous landmarks throughput your journeys.-Everything about the carsAll the cars have lots of detal, interior and exterior. They are all different to drive, and unique in their own ways. Also, all the sounds for the cars are the legit real life sounds, recorded from the cars in a sound studion. SO nice.--- Things I like -Customization of carThe customization is quite good, especially compared to most of the recent need for speed games. The only problem is the customizations seem too concrete, there is no ability to add your own imagination or personal touch. Some stickers have different colors, but you can't change the color of a specific sticker. Also, each sticker goes on a certain, unchangable place on the car. You can make your car different than others, because there a large number of aesthetic parts and stickers.-Car specsI really like how the car can utilize many different utilities by changing the spec. There are 5 specs: Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit. They are all fun to experiment with. Some are great for the racetrack, while others are great for offroad trails. My only gripe about specs is that very few cars have the full 5 specs, most have 1-3 of the the specs. The starter cars all have the full 5 specs, so you will be able to have them all in at least one car.-The storyIt is surprising for a good story to be in a racing game, but in this case that surprise came true. It may seem cheesy and cliche to some people, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. -The graphicsThey aren't amazing by any means, but they are good. They capture american geography well (with a few minor hiccups) but there are many current racing games that have better graphics. They are definitely not bad though, they still make the game nice looking. The best graphics in the game are seen in some of the cutscenes. Legitimate movie quality cutscences.--- Things i dont like -The ""mmo"" aspect of the gameOnly 8 players in your session, and they players continually switch to different players, so, yeah, no. I still don't really know how to play with my friends, because there is no server choice, just places you in one.-Not that many carsThere really should be more.-Anything that has to do with AIOther racers, cops, even NPC traffic. All equally annoying.-Customization of your characterNonexistent. Hopefully you are okay with the way you look, cuz you can't change that.--- Things I HATE -ubisoft-uplay-ubisoft support-uplay servers-ubisoft bugs-uplay bugs-ubisoft glitches-uplay glitches-ubisoft in general-uplay in generalFortunately, ubisoft only published this game not developed, so it isn't UNPLAYABLE (i.e. ACU) a good company called Ivory Tower made it, which was responsible for some other open world maps (i.e. GTA 4) Some things about the game just seem buggy and unfinished, not because of Ivory Tower, but because of ubisoft. It just seems like with the many delays the game should be PERFECT but it isn't.And now, for the thing I HATE the most about the crew, the following is a reddit rant that i put onto /r/The_Crew/ :Originally posted by author of this review: There is one thing that i just can't get past about this game: THE MIRRORS DON'T WORK! I mean SERIOUSLY!!!!! WHY?!?!??! test drive unlimted from THE 80'S has working mirrors.http:// http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xSvpmi79ZXY/0.jpg  <---FREAKING 8 BIT MIRRORS! and the crew doesn't. GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH3 reasons why the crew doesn't have mirrors1. ...2. ...3. ...Don't get me wrong I love the game but.....I JUST CAN'T GET PAST THATOk thanks for reading all that. I'm done now. The good conclusion:The game's main feature, a big map, is DEFINITELY true. The map, the cars, the graphics, all together make the game an great, interesting, and fun experience.The bad conclusion:The online, which was the other big feature, fails to deliver. There are many online problems and bugs that make some give up on the game. But I am not a quitter. My Rating:  8/10 Final conclusion (tl;dr) :This game offers an amazing experience, one that I have never seen in any other game. Simply being able to take a trip down a desert highway, explore a mountain, race around a city, and explore the entirety of the United states is something that no other game has ever done so beautifully.Overall great game, beautiful map, beautiful cars, just some problems that need addressing. My rating is subject to go up if those improvements are made. The crew is definitely my favorite driving game, and it will never get old or boring. With a map the size of the U.S., how could it? Happy driving!  "

												I never really got into the story of this game but it seemed really cool. The graphics are nice and the cars are cool and there are lots of customization option which is always nice. The fact that their are cities that look just like real life is awesome! I would recommend this game to someone who likes racing games or even driving becuase I could cruise around this awesome map for hours. So this is Ubisoft meaning it could be a pretty big price tag. This game is often not on sale so it is expensive but it is worth it. So I would rate this game a 8.9/10			"

												Easy game to recommend. Loads of fun. Yes...I have a Nvidia card and had to rollback the drivers but not that hard to do to enjoy the game. Not a reason not to recommend the game.The game play is fun and a great open world. I had the difficult time of sitting down and trying to figure out which  game I would play more Crew, Project Cars, or Assetto. I choose Crew and not to say anything about the others...because I don't have them, but I am enjoying this and getting some decent game time in.This reminds me of Driver and I think the graphics are pretty damn good, now this isn't a true racing sim, which is good for me (IE, I suck at those).  I find moving from one course to the next to the next, repetitive and stale in a racing game. The open map, side challenges, plenty of cars to choose from, motorcycles, monster trucks.... a good variety that allows one to find different things to do and not get bored. On sale it's a great buy.			"

 Easily the best racing game I've ever played Popular criticisms include; ""handling too much for an arcade game"" Because it's not an arcade game""wheelspin is too much"" because you're using a 250 horsepower shot of nitrous in a car with a 10:3 power-to-weight ratioUnfortunately because Ubisoft has listened to what they're hearing (ie; game hate faries on the forums) the AI has been brought down to a minimum.Game has a huge map, probably the biggest of any open world game so far, the car handling is amazing, physics are pretty much bang-on, the in-game community is great, the car customization could use some work but it's a very small kink in an otherwise well-oiled machine. As a veteran racing-game enthusiast (weird guy that 100%s gran turismo games) it took me almost 20 hours to get through the story mode watching every cutscene, the story is even good although somewhat generic, it's well done. If you're an open-world racing game fan this game will probably give you a weird feeling, traditionally we saw games where you could see it, but not necessarily go to it. With this that simply isn't the case, if you can see it in The Crew, you can almost always go there. 6 levels of customization put the game's huge map to use, they are fullstock, street, dirt, Perf (performance), raid (trophy trucks), and circuit (full-blown race cars) each with it's own merits and downfalls that add an unmatched level of diversity to the game.The options menu is even pretty comprehensive with toggles for anti-aliasing, even types of anti-aliasing. individual performance impactors with their own toggles, and full wheel support with multiple ways of customizing so you can tune it to your driving style. All in all a fantastic game, even after the career mode there's plenty to do and fun to be had. 9/10			"

												Fantastic game. Each spec you unlock changes how you play, and upgrading your vehicle is rewarding and challenging. Community events, plans for additional vehicles and features, and a strong fanbase/developer relationship means that The Crew has a bright future. The only downside is that a constant internet connection is required to play due to the MMO aspect, but considering no one seems to complain about World of Warcraft needing a constant network connection to play, I find it difficult to justify that complaint. If you're looking for a racing game that goes beyond what any Need for Speed title, especially the soon to be discontinued Need for Speed World, The Crew is just what you're looking for.			"

												This game is amazing: despite the Ubisoft logo.The map is 3x larger than GTAV, me and a friend measured Seattle to the Miami Keys and it's roughly 98.9 miles.Other than that, flawless launch from Ivory Tower, very good optimization for a game designed for high end pc's.It runs fine on my 750 Ti SC. My favorite parts is Death Valley, the Black Hills, even though I've only discovered only 6% of the map. I can't praise Ubisoft and Ivory Tower enough for The Crew. It is a huge check mark in the positive coloum for PC gaming. It's far from them earning their reputation back, but it's a very good start. Glitches and bugs are expected since this game is brand new.WIth nice little easter eggs and salutes to past racing game legends like Need For Speed World, Hot Pursuit 2010, Burnout Paradise, Shift 2 Unleashed, Test Drive Unlimited 1 & 2 and many more, The Crew is a hotbed of MMO racing that just feels right. How many other games out there can you tune a Ford GT to 700hp, and wreck a Koenigsegg Agera R? I can't think of many.Another huge check mark is the fact that the devs actually watch the forums; someone suggested that a free roam cam be added, like the one in NFS World, and within 12 hours someone from Ubisoft responded saying that something like that is in the works...Now that's rare now a days.

												This game is my dream, my dream has become true!Pros-above average driving physics and handling-huge map america and free roam-car tunning/customization-highly detailed car interiors-wheel support-good story mode-dynamic day cycle-cops-despite it's huge map, nice graphics-playing with friends is so fun-0 lag in multiplayer and not many connection problems-Perks are nice-diffrent car specs like street, circuit, dirt...Cons-this game requires internet connection-despite it's highly detailed car interiors, they didn't put digital displays on cars like navigation screen, gearbox screen, digital speed o meters in some cars like 458 speciale. also bmw m5's dial is broken-this game makes addiction :P-poor soundtracks, i mean its really bad or should I say worst?This game really worth buying especially if you like car trips or wanna go and see america...

												It's an assertion that doesn't make any sense! Ubisoft has sold The Crew as a racing game, and there are certainly plenty of parts where you drive your car really fast. Hell, there's a race in this game that's four hours long (more on that later).The Crew  isn't a racing game though. Not really. I have no doubt it was pitched as a racing game, and I know why it's being sold as a racing game, and it's because a racing game is something people can understand. It's the same reason Assassin's Creed needs some ridiculous science fiction frame story—because in 2007 the idea of an action game set during the Third Crusade wasn't ""viable."" "

												I would like to start off with the biggest reason I even recommend this game is because it is the closest thing we PC gamers have to Midnight Club L.A.I love and hate this game! What is does right, it does right! What is does wrong, it really does it wrong!I will only list the things wrong and missing in the game. It has everything else in my opinion!1. This is possibly the biggest one for me and I don’t really know why! The side and rearview mirrors don’t work! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING! Almost every racing game has working mirrors!Racing games on mobile, last gen systems even the PS2 AND PS1 racing games had working mirrors!This seriously needs to be fixed!2. Not enough races or race types! There are plenty of street challenges… -_-There are so few races that I forget I’m playing a RACING GAME sometimes!3. Damage on cars are overdone in some places and underdone in others!If I hit a leaf, my whole front end looks like I hit a tree at 200mph! But glass wont break or even crack even if I roll my car! This just seems lazy!4. Textures look good on your cars and most of the environments. It’s not what you would expect from a next gen graphics game, but they look good. And with the size and scope of the game I would think they look amazing! Where is the bad? EVERY SINGLE PEDESTRIAN CAR AND THE PEDESTRIANS WALKING DOWN THE STREET! I have seen better textures on the PS2! I swear I am not exaggerating! They look horrible!!!I can’t even begin to figure out why they thought this was OK!5. Now on to the little things. No neon lights. Why is this a big deal? It is and isn’t. I like neon’s, what can I say? But in a game that is supposed to be an MMO, you need to have more customization!6. No window tints.7. Very limited on body parts.8. The game has a lot of rims to choose from, but 90% of them all look the same!9. Cant paint parts different colors.10. The performance parts system is kind of wack! Look it up on YouTube.11. Not a lot of cars to choose from. But at least they had my Skyline!12. Its structured as a F2P type game. Now that wouldn’t be such a problem if it weren’t for the fact that they are selling it for $60. Plus I have played some F2P racing games that felt more complete than this game that had WORKING MIRRORS! (Sorry, but I’m not going to ever let that go till they fix it).At any rate, the game is fun, not worth what I paid, but fun.Buy it on a sale, a BIG sale! Anything over $20 is way too much! But if you really want to play a game that kind of reminds you of Midnight Club L.A. then this is the game for you….Kind of.. -_-So yes I recommend it, even though is sucks! "

												So, I don't get the negative response. Sure, right after the release - when I got it - the game didn't feel finished in any way. I myself was a bit disapointed, but still played on. The reason I got the game was because of the HUGE map, which was in pretty good shape at the time. The cars didn't feel too realistic and I didn't feel the ""feeling"" I was expecting. But still, I plaed it, because I just bought it and wanted to try it out. I then stopped playing it for a couple of months as I had other things to do. Then a while back I started playing it again. The feeling was completley different. The cars were updated from the last time I played, and countless bugfixes had been fixed. I played it with my brother and had really fun! (Except the graphics I have on it as my computer is pretty bad xD) So would I recomend this game? Well, it depends. If you can relate to all of the following you should pick it up, and you will have a great time. So:-If you have friends that play it-If you like car games, but your not looking for a super realistic simulator-If you want a HUGE open world to explore So the first point is really important. If you have friends to play with. If you don't, it will get boring after a while. You basicly just sit there driving arround. This is after all a game made for multiplayer. Although the ""story mode"" which is still in the online world was better than I expected.So overall should you buy this? Well if you have friends that play it, yes, of you don't well it's still wuite fun as you can still find people online to talk with, but it is not as fun as cruising arround with your frineds. If your unsure I sugests that you pick it up during a Steam sale of any sort. At the monent while typing this, there is a 50% discount due to the steam summer sale.I hope this helped you, and I would recomend this game. (Maybe due to my 88 hours playtime xD)			"

Finally a good old Need for Speed like game!This game is a really good game. The Crew is a Open World Racing Game with MMO and Coop features.You get into the role of a racer named Alex who gets pretty much trouble with the group 5-10 of his brother. After his death you are on the way to get revenge!Pls dont be too angry to me and my language. I´m not the best in writing english, but i want to tell you my opinion of this game, because it deserves to be telled of :)Short Version- Graphics: 7 / 10- Performance: 10 / 10- Storytelling: 7 / 10- Possibilitys: 10 / 10- Server-Onlinetime: 9 / 10► Total Grade: 9 / 10Long VersionGraphicsThe Graphics of this game are pretty good and well done for a racing game being that big. But compared to other titles released today not the best and detailed one. Not saying that they are almost perfect for a game like this, its still not the best it could be.Shader is well done, also the Antialising. Textures are well but not that detailed and a little bit ""spongy"" if you are looking close to them. However, its a well done composition of textures and it´s nice for the eye.7 / 10PerformanceDue to the fact, that this game has a dang big world to explore and the graphics are pretty nice the performance is incredible. I was surprised that this game runs on a very low quality computer of a friend very stable and well. You got almost every time the amount of fps you loocked in the options. (30 or 60)Nothing more to add. Perfect performance for a game like this and for a game of this generation.10 / 10StorytellingThe game has a OK story but it is pretty long and has it plots and twists. Short cutscenes, short dialogs.I´d had it rated lower if it does´t have a playtime like this. If you play casual you can come through the story in something like 25 - 30 hours which is very long for singleplayer/or coop story without using the extra things and PvP a long time.7 / 10PossibilitysThe Crew offers a veeery big world to explore. To get from the west to the eastcoast you are driving something like 2-3 hours if you are fast. Also you got additional to the Storyraces and PvPstuff a tons of tests/skill mini missions where you can test your skills in some small disciplins. Escape fast, drive fast on a road, climb a hill and so on. If you want to get through everything you are going to have some 100 hours.In addition The Crew offers a very good Tuning system. Optic tuning is back in business in a little bit smaller version of the ""Need for Speed Underground 2"" tuning possibilitys. Front, Back, Enginecover, Side, inside the car, outside the car, vinyls and weels. You can change many things in the optic again which is a must have for racing games in my opinion.The powertuning is a little bit different. You get stuff after completing Missions and Skilltests. The bigger the level and the better you are, the better the stuff will be you are adding to your car. Later on you can get ""Platinum-Rank"" in every mission and skilltest which offers good stuff for your car in every skilltest and mission, the lowlevel ones and the highlevel ones.There is a good variation of cars in this game, however i miss a little bit the cheap streetcars like in the beginning of Underground 2 which you had to tune from zero to hero. You start with a little bit besser ""level"" of cars. You can find tiles and build secret cars and you can buy cars from the carstores. In the end you will have a variation of something like 40-50 cars i guess.Big world, finally good tuning, many missions and extras. Its a racing game we waited for years to release.10 / 10Server OnlinetimeSadly its an only online racing game which palys on a big Ubisoft server. (Or some servers, i dont know, you cant choose). You will put together with players in one session who are your ubisoft friends and who are on the same story-progression like you are.So you will see allways your friends and possible helpers for your mission.Servers are very stable in my eye. However, some disconnects happened to be true, but these didnt happen very often and i could play most of the time.9 / 10Total GradeIf we put everything together and a little bit of my personal grad we will get this grade which is in my eye a true one. Pls dont forget to Comment if you have another opinion or want to add something :)9 / 10[/b]- Evilemerold "

												I think it's pretty fun. It's a driving game and that's exactly what you do. Anyone complaining about car handling probably hasn't gotten max level parts. My cars handle great after doing jumps and stuff to get level 50 parts for my vehicles. Now they handle like a champ and are extremely easy to drive. Not to mention, you can go into the options and completely customize car handling to your liking.Boring storyline but this has one of the biggest game environments out there.			"

												Great game, storyline is solid. But you can't ""customize"" your car, you can only add packages, i.e. street package, performance package, with some flexibility otherwise. Graphics aren't the greatest, but gameplay is more important. Well, offline gameplay is, considering the community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. What people like to do is form little posses of 3 or 4 cars, then find solo players just cruisin' around and run them off the road to the point where online gameplay is literally intolerable, since you can't drive anywhere. On top of that, grandma's Nissan has the same physics as a Dodge Ram 1500, so theres no way to defend yourself. To add insult to injury, I bought the ""game of the year"" edition, or whatever they're calling it now. So thats just 85 bucks down the drain.If I still haven't turned you off yet, I'd like to mention that you need UPlay to run this game. What's UPlay? It's like Steam, for Ubisoft. UPlay and Steam hate each other. It's nearly impossable to get in a game with people from your friends list because it's so hard to get Steam and UPlay to work together.Still need more? Recently there was an update for The Crew that added a new feature called ""Wild Run"". Wild Run is 25 dollars, regardless of whether you bought the season pass. What? I just paid 85 dollars for your game and I still don't have everything? Now, Wild Run includes a feature for the player to do races with other players, which was availible as a part of base game. Was. Now, unless you pay Ubisoft even MORE money, you can no longer play with other people, which was the original intent of the game; multiplayer co-op racing. Ubisoft just decided that it was a good idea to completely disable the most vital part of the game in favor of petty amounts of profit.Ubisoft recently released a new DLC for police chases called ""Calling all Units"" which I was really psyched for. Turns out, just like Wild Run, even though I have a season passI still need to pay EVEN MORE for this content. The Crew, plus the season pass, plus Wild Run, plus Calling all Units equals well over 120 dollars. Honestly Ubisoft, when does the money hoarding end?Screw you, Ubisoft. I'd give anything to get my hands on one of your devs right now.			"

												Before wild run, it was a really good game. It has a huge map, a very large selection of cars, and multiplayer, the career, and faction missions were fun. Now the game is unplayable due to Ubisoft's negligence to fix the game-breaking map rendering glitch. It's been there for 6 months, and whenever I play the game I encounter it and have to restart. It not only makes freedrive, career, and faction missions unplayable, but causes multiplayer to black screen until the person with the glitch leaves. TLDR: Ubisoft made the game unplayable and hasn't fixed it for 6 months. Don't buy it and think twice before buying any other Ubisoft titles.			"

												Got it on sale for $40 - Gold Edition. Then it is worth the price. Screw paying $80, no matter how good.And this game is great :) The world across the US is amazing. Cities feel familiar and the modelling is excellent. Mini challenges always keep it fun. Story line is great, much better than NFS franchise (another EA horse beaten dead). The PVP lobby system not that good. My cars went from 200 through 800 during the story game and get matched up with 1200 cars. No point in racing even. Guess the lower levels are playing the story game.Driving is excellent and feels good handling. There quite a few neat tricks to learn. The different kind of cars drive great (street, dirt, perf, raid) and you get to upgrade the visuals to get amazing cars.I'll keep coming back to get a few 1200 rides and kick some PVP♥♥♥♥♥ Well done guys, great game.

												I can't be more honest than that.The game is cool, Actually, Its pretty amazing.Tho i got some thing to say about it.First, I will start with the PROS i guess.SO THE PROS:-The world is huge. You can drive for hours. (I literaly finished a race with a 104 minute record.)-Theres a weather system, Also day and night. Which really affects the gameplay.-TONS OF CARS.-The game not stands for full singleplayer, You can make a crew (A some sort of group that will join your missions.) -Pvp (NOT ONLY RACING, Theres a lot of multiplayer pvp mods !)-Upgrading and modding your car... Oh man.. This part. You just need to see the customization. (Ps. Made me poop myself when first saw).-You can have a driving test before getting a new car-Theres Voice chat and a regular chat. (Also whisper, crew chat and etc)-Theres a lot more honestly just. idk less important for this review (You should also taste by yourself you know.)So ofcousre after Pros. I should hit with the Cons !-The biggest con by my opinion. Is the crashing system.Crashing into cards happends a lot (Even if you are not bad like me.) Lets say you gotta race inside the city and theres a turn left or right doesnt matter. Sometime, Because its a city after all, Theres cars waiting for that green light. Yea, In that moments youll find cars all over the road except to the right direction.I find it really annoying. Playing Perf spec (I guess the most fast cars in the game) On a road which is not straight inside the city totally can caus your death. (I did played a mission like that, i wanted to punch my screen, AND I CONSIDER MYSELF A CALMED PERSON.)[Woah thats a big con]^-When you buy a car, No refunds. You cant really regret it. Same with specs.-When theres a chat notification you dont really get it, You need to open the chat box, unless you make it visible the whole time, Which kinda disturbs.I must say, By my opinion once again, There is not a lot of cons to the game. Just really basic things. Handling isnt even bad. (Just on peft spec cars. Well thats because its ♥♥♥♥ing hard.) But yet the game extremely fun, and enjoyable.I really hope you enjoyed my review. Make sure to like it if it helped you so other can see it aswell. *SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISHHHHH*Peace and love sugars. "

												I recently added the The Crew Gold Edition to my library. So far, I really like the game.The graphics are great. Very well done.I'm still getting used to driving the cars, but I will eventually.The game does require a Uplay Account, and the Uplay Client.Please refer to this game's details for information regarding those terms.

												This is a fun game for what it is. It is by no strecth of the imagination what the developers told us it was going to be and unless you feel ok with mucking around with router settings the ""never drive alone"" tag-line will be a confident slap in the face. But it is still a fun arcade racer that looks good and offers some really nice open world play with a lot of things to do from jumps and slaoms to classic exploring. Also once you get it to work PvP multi-player is fun and frantic. Same with the co-op part of the game. It is far from perfect but it is still one really good ride.That being said... It has some very shifty multiplayer and use som peer2peer solution limiting how many players you can run at the same time. It also have DLC and pay-only cars out the tailpipe.			"

												In my point of view is a great game, this game is suitable for players who enjoy exploration, fun and hard to be tedious, has good graphics, very good gameplay and challenging in their ways; I confess I had some problems to start the game for the first time, I did not find enough information that could guide me in the game installation process, but I give my congratulations will official community Facebook who gave me information, support and sharing knowledge to I could play for the first time. There are also difficulties to play with my group friends, the game is limited to a few section of players difficult to complete missions of the game, even with friends in the game is not available, and it is not presented as friends in the game, for me this is only negative point of the game; as I am an enthusiast and racing games lover this game for me it is very good! Recommend to all racing game lovers, this game has problems like any other game features, which will differentiate is the predisposition of each player.			"

												Not an MMO, but still really good. If your looking for a good story or a game where you have a 100 car garage though, you've come to the wrong place. This game is more of a game where you buy one car for each class and upgrade the hell out of it. The driving is great if you mess with the settings and the challenges are decent. Overall if you want to race from one end of America to the other then buy it but if you want an open world racing sim then you're wasting your time.			"

Only drawback is that the game is always online, which will be a deal breaker for some people.Also, this is a great game for road trips.			"

In my opinion, it's the closest we have to a modern Burnout right now.For those with kids, I let my 5 year old drive around the countryside all the time. It's easy to ignore the main plotline and just explore. He loves it.			"

												I really looked forward to this game because the idea behind this is very appealing. But unfortunately Ubisoft didn't do a great job of implementing.Positive things about this game, the map is huge and there is so much room for playing so that's certainly a good thing. The graphics are ok, but that is not something that bothers me too much. The idea to form a crew is also a good thing, but is poorly implemented and there are so much things to do with it to make it better, but they didn't. Faction races are great, but could be a lot better. For instance, make a race with a destination point and you can choose with route to take. The physics are not great, but not bad either. Only thing the cars should do is drift, instead of constant understeer.So yeah, there are a lot of things that could be done better and it really dissapoints. This game had a massive potential to become something great, but it didn't take that chance. Maybe The Crew 2 will be better, if that game will ever arrive of course. Not something you should buy i say, unless you really really want to.			"

												30 hours in and I still have much to do. The world is so damn big and traveling from point A to point B is not boring at all since the world is full of different challenges for fast and agile cars. Upon completing these challenges, you earn parts for your car. If you don't need the parts, you can send it to your garage which will allow you to build up another car in the future.Story missions have you racing against time, destroying crates of supplies, catching up to an NPC and making them crash, and more.This game has car builds for dirt, street, drift, raid, and circuit racing. I probably forgot one, but that list should show you that this game is the whole package.Jumping online with friends is as easy as meeting up at a certain location and grouping up. Most of the campaign can be completed with a friend.Warning about DLC:""Wild Run"" is a DLC pack. You do not need it to enjoy this game, but you will occasionally run into cars and missions unavailable, but don't worry about it. I've been doing just fine without it, but I will pick it up on a sale because I definitely want this game to last even longer. "

												While the story is somewhat entertaining, the gameplay is really quite boring. There's literally nothing to do but race around, and while it is a racing game, the trailers hinted at other forms of gameplay and much more exciting cinematics. It's not a bad game, but its not a good game either. The story is pretty minimal compared to most games, and trying to tie this story into a continually running server-based platform makes for some really annoying drive times.Also we were promised the whole country, as though that would be to scale. Nope. Everything has been scaled down so that most of the cities are a third of their actual sizes. I threw down a lot of money for this game because I thought I would be getting a lot out of it. Really, because of the setup we actually got, I say this game is worth no more than $30. If the animations and the LOD look right up your alley, you might be inspired to pay $40. But never is it ever worth the full AAA studio pricing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So now that we have Wild Run, I guess the only thing I can say is WHY didn't I get it with my season pass? Considering it adds modes like DRAG racing, DRIFTING, etc. that most racing games have from the start, I think it should have been a free update. I won't be wasting my money on Wild Run though. The gameplay as a whole is still really boring.			"

												I bought this game because it was developed by the same team behind Test Drive Unlimited, TDU and TDU2 weren't top notch games in terms of handling, but they had this ""charm"", I found TDU2 so relaxing, I played it for hours and it was really fun just driving around the islands, it had its big flaws like the ridiculous handling but somehow it was fun. I expected the same calm and relaxing mood from The Crew, sadly one of its biggest selling point was their worst feature IMO, the change to RPG style ruined the game, the idea was good but the IA of your opponents is completely crap, to the point that the game wasn't fun to me at all but frustrating, I really wanted to continue playing this game but I just couldn't, I don't have the time I had a few years ago and the fun isn't there anymore, that's why I cannot recommend this game to anyone, it's not a simulator and  it's too arcade that it's not fun either, please note that I played this game with a Logitech G27 wheel, that made it worst because the game is intended to be played with gamepad for its ridiculous handling, TDU was playable but The Crew is not, and you can't progress through the missions if you don't level up, so you will find yourself wasting time on repetitive side missions in order to play the story missions.I hope that in the future there will be another Test Drive Unlimited, with the same idea but improved, if I wanted to enjoy 20 minutes driving trhough the beautiful Hawaii and Ibiza, without feeling pressure to level up or completing frustrating missions TDU was the one, maybe I'm wrong because I thought The Crew was going to be that game, and the team had a completely different idea of the game, but this wasn't the game I expected.

												1st let me say I have never written a review for any game before.Now I ama racing game lover but for the last 5 years or so I haven't found a racing game that can hold my interest for more than an hour at a time.  I bought this game with a friend and he and I mostly play together and that is extremely fun.The story is just ok, not great but who cares this is a racing game.  There are not a lot of cars in the game at the moment but that is ok all of the cars in the game a really nice.  I drive from inside the car with the dash board view, unless I am doing the missions where you run through a banner as you go because it takes you off road and you are usually running through brush and you just can't see from inside.I really like this game and came into it with no preconceived notions about what to expect.  My buddy and I just spent 2 1/2 hours just driving and unlocking more of the map occasionally doing fun side races.This brings me back to the old original test drive games way back when.I really really like this game and the only con I have at the moment is I do get discord and it takes 15 to 20 minutes to get back on.This is an Mmo but just like most new mmo's you don't have to play with other people.

												If you looking for an arcade style racing game you better play this than any of the NFS games after Underground 1-2/Carbon/Pro Street.*Huge world with thousands of places to visit. Never race the same track again.*Open gameplay. Play the story, PVP, global tournament series, challanges, faction wars or just go and start chasing random people in the world. You chose to go single player, multiplayer or both. All in the same game.*Many different car types plus bikes all with specific race types and different strenghts/weaknesses (street, race, drift, drag, dirt, monster truck, etc)*customisation (not as in-depth as NFS UG 1-2 but still a nice addition)If you still not sure because of the mixed reviews wait for a sale and in worst case you can get a refund, but trust me in less than two hours it will suck you in.

												The Crew is a great game. simple as that, but it defineitely has areas that should be improved but first let me start with the positives.It is easy to progress through the game, provides a challenge, has a huge map to travel around, encourages open world driving by including street and dirt vehicles, beautiful landscape and monuments to visit, controller support (including steering wheel) and the endgame makes you feel like a god but, there are some flaws.cons:1. traffic- although this is pretty fun to dodge around in free roam, it can be really frustrating when you're trying to beat a mission where one mistake can ruin everything but it adds a challenge. The worst part is when you crash there is a cutscene that plays and will ruin your time even though you can skip it and also there are road block made by the AI because they crashed into the car themselves.(hopefully that made sense)2. Physics- This games physics are terrible most people can easily look up an example of this but for the sake of this review, i would list some for you. Some are: crashing into a wall and being sent into the air, hitting a little sidewalk will make you do a wheelie or crashing into a vehicle will push it aside instead of a collision.3. Short storyline- TBH this doesnt bother me as much as it does for other people. If youre looking for a racing game then this is a racing game. overall the story is pretty boring and short.4. The DLC- another thing that bothers other people, this game kinda forces you into the DLC but personally i bought the complete edition which saves a lot of money in the long run if you plan on buying this game because it comes with a lot of cars and the season pass (At this the the calling all units is coming out soon)(Side note) progression is too quick?- I dont know about anybody else but i beat the main storyline and hit the level cap pretty quickly within maybe 4 days of playing. This didnt bother me because i wanted the endgame cars that are fast. Also within a week of casually playing, i already maxed out a couple of cars and a motorcycle dont know if its just me or not but if you buy this game you will find out.5. glitches- This one kinda goes along with physics but while playing, there will sometimes be invisible bumbs in the road and when you crash on the wall occasionally you will get stuck in it or you will be on top of it and will probably have to reset to fix it.6. Online- This game requires you to be connected to the internet at all times not much to say here but its extremely easy to play with friends at least.Even with all these things i still would recommend this game especially if its on sale (I got it during the steam summer sale) Not going to lie this game needs some tweaks and shows a lot of potential. Perhaps future DLC will provide an even bigger map (although i doubt as that will take a lot of resources and time) In the end, if you are looking for a fun arcade racing game this is your go to choice, you can race solo or with friends and overall have a great time. although i said the physics need to be updated, it still makes this game enjoyable for messing around. I hope that if you reading this that you buy the game and expand this community.			"

I would have no problem recommending this game to anyone. Is it the best game i have played? No its certainly not But its damn close, The best game i have ever play was The Last of us but thats besides the point. This game is good fun for anyone who is into racing games and wants to have a great time chilling with there friends roleing around MURICA! just having good ol fashion fun.

												The Crew tries to be a driving game with something for everyone. You can team up with a group of friends for an epic road trip filled with fast-paced illegal activities, and seamlessly explore a massive map of the U.S., from the tip of Maine, all the way down to Miami, over to Los Angeles and back again, passing through other iconic cities along the way. Though it's true that all of this is possible, the experience isn't all that it's made out to be. The Crew tries to do a lot, and while it technically delivers the features it promises, it frequently stumbles over itself. There are brief moments of joy within, but just when you start to think the game's turned a corner, a bump in the road sends your joyride careening off course. When the best thing a racing game has going for it is the variety of environments it has to offer, you know something's amiss.You start off in the streets of Detroit, but it's not long before you're rolling through mountains, everglades, and forests. The huge maps and its colossal number of activities is intimidating at first, but that's great: the more places to go and things to do, the merrier. Story missions, which take you through a trope-filled campaign that plays out like a Fast & Furious sequel, send you from one region of the country to the next, and missions emerge out of the blue along the way. You street race, smuggle contraband, take down competing criminals, and tackle bite-sized emergent challenges that test your abilities behind the wheel while you're on the go. There are hundreds of things to do, but only some are truly fun. The problem? With so much ground to cover, The Crew feels and looks like it's stretched too thin, and it's evident from the start. The Crew's world may be massive and varied, but it's not good-looking. It's constantly plagued by texture and geometry pop-in, and looks generally outdated. People, buildings, the environment, and most importantly, the cars, are represented by disappointing models that suffer from an unsightly amount of aliasing.Keep in mind that if UPlay, PSN, or Xbox Live is down, you can't play The Crew, even if you just want to go solo. During my time with the game, I was booted due to server or connection issues on a daily basis, which was very frustrating. The most enjoyment you get out of the game's connected world comes from player-vs-player competitions, but even they have issues.			"

Are you looking for a Next Gen racing experience? Go look somewhere else.UPDATE: 01/11/15After nearly 3 months after launch there were only 2 patches correcting minor stuff but not a single commitment from Ubisoft on addressing wanted features in the game. The Steam user satisfaction dropped its recommendation from 96% to 77% and it will continue to go down as more people figure out how little this game offers after 20 hours - which is a ridiculous little time for a MMO. --- CONTINUE TO STAY AWAY.I've pre-ordered The Crew Gold +Season Pass expecting that all publishing on hard working to bring a new concept of game would be delivered. After my first 8 hours with the game I'm never ever buying Ubisoft games at launch anymore (As I'm already doing with Assassin's Creed franchise since Brotherhood).The game isn't an evolution from what we've seen on the Beta phase, it is just a ""stability"" upgrade in all aspects. To be honest, the only thing I've seen implemented from what was asked on forums during closed and open betas was the ability to change the gear faster while on manual shift, almost everything requested by the community was ignored.To review the game I've used a Nvidia GTX-780 + i7-4770K overclocked, my personal impressions below:- Are you ready for Ubisoft concept of MMO? It was confirmed by Ubi Community Manager that the ""bug of few people per map"" is in fact working as designed since they believe 8 player per map is OK.For a game where the selling point is ""Massive open world"" this is a flaw. - Don't expect to be able to play multiplayer, cause it isn't working as it should. It took me about 50 tries to be able to do 1 single coop mission since the message ""There is no one in your session"" was constantly been displayed even while I could see about 10 players on the map screen. - Do you like driving from cockpit and using the rear mirrors? Hopefully not cause they we're NOT implemented at all you will see is a gray piece of junk that since it isn't showing your rear shouldn't even be there. Surprisinly and adding ""more fun"" to the randomness of this issue, when you put your view in 3rd person mode (behind the car)... TA DA! The mirrors magically start working! W-T-F!!!Lets pause for a little reflection:  Since 1987 we have working rear mirrors thanks to Test Drive 1 but not in this advanced ""next gen"" title? There is no other racing series considering doing the same crap.- Anti-Alising is so horribly implemented that even downsampling from 4K resolution to 1080p you will notice the jadded edges everywhere. Specially when you're wandering inside cities hopefully you will not bother on blinking edges in general scenario elements like fences and light lamps, buildings and cars as you will be near to have a convulsion. Surprisinly AAs seems to had worked a lot better with ""wild nature"" elements so trees and vegetation don't suffer in the same heavy way cities do;This is my tweak guide to correct the game Anti Alising to an standard expected by a Next Gen title:http://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/617321352146025421/?tscn=1417713397Still considering the fact that at DAY 2 I'm trying to manually override what was delivered in the ""official pack"" , Customer Satisfaction is barely achieved on that aspect;- Looking for Dynamic Lighting and Shadows? Bad for you cause your car and whatever is capable of emitting light doesn't create any shadows! Ugly absurd issues from WatchDogs are all back to terrorize people dreams of playing decent games;- Your car is the only thing on the screen that seems to be made with more than 20 poligons. When compared with your own, all other cars and objects are ugly and seems to be toys or re-used models from games launched back from 90's - Specially Mini Vans - Maybe they have used the same from SEGA Crazy Taxi? Seems very similar to me. ** This can be minimized using my Anti Alising guide - check the LOD BIAS section **- Real bad textures. If you stay like 5 meters from any building you will few like playing GTA3. Ambient Occlusion made them feel more alive but they're all ugly and not even close to HD;- Dust and smoke effects from Counter Strike 1.6 are better than what we can see here;- Offline mode isn't working. You need to stay online on UPlay or, once you get in the game, it will ask you to connect to UPlay and restart it;- There is  no dynamic weather at all;- Engine sounds are very generic;TL;DR:As it is right now, there is no reason why you should buy this game for more than 20 dollars. If you want a good looking racing experience, buy Shadow of Mordor and ride a Warg. I ensure you that your experience would be better than any hype you may have here and you will have a really good game.Besides that, give the game some time to have Ubisoft to fix its outstanding issues and the magicians from the internet to discover what Ubisoft have disabled under the hood to make it similar to the console versions.

												So as you can see i have almost 1000 hours of gametime on The Crew.  I have played since the game was officially released and own almost every spec of every car.  When this game was released it got all kinds of terrible reviews but even at that time in it's incomplete state it was a good arcade style racing game compared to any NFS-type game before it.  Since that time they have added cars, stickers, colors, pvp options, graphics, race modes, bikes, monster trucks, 3 new specs (monster, drift, drag) in addition to the 5 already available (street, dirt, perf, raid, circuit), freedrive challenges, and tons of other things!  Some people will sit here and cry and complain about some technical issues with crashing, which is there from time to time, but with the amount of options they're adding to the game it's totally worth it.  Need For Speed is completely inferior to this game.  I have spent 125 dollars on this game including game, expansion pack, and season pass... I don't regret this at all because this game has been worth it!  There is no better open world arcade style racing game on the market right now (may 2016).			"

												While I finally got it running, the story and games are hardly worth playing. I bought this game to modify cars but It lacks everything I see in a game.Has: cars, Customization (Extremely tight limit), races in general, police? sortofNeeds: Better leveling system, easier access to leveling, more car parts, less dlc, Normal fkn money system (For once would it hurt to be realistic?) less focus on dlc sales and more on the story and ability to actually play the whole game without suffering through story after story to get some sht parts they throw about on these pidly races. Not even worth my time to play.This game is honestly not worth even sale price. this feels like a 2 or 3 dollar game I'd buy to mess around with friends but I wouldn;t want to inflect the horrerss of over priced dlc they cut from the game to make a quick buck.Not to mention it's 3rd party so you might as well buy it on uplay because you'll be logging in there anyways to play it.Face it ubisoft, Your games are rushed and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Chopped up like ham for easy money.

												To give you an idea i was in the beta before i had even pre-ordered the gold edition....I thought i liked this game and then game the delays, the broken servers, the crashing, no one on the servers, the microtransactions, the amount every car in the game costs ...seriously what car is that expensive, the falling through the map, the in car view is broken if you apply the handbrake during a turn, the buying of parts, the fact people were playing it before it was released, the broken physics, the fact that ive driven a 70s cadillac that feels like it would handle better than any of the cars in game, the fact that you dont get enough faction points or whatever to rank up at all seriously do you know how long a mission with good payout is. I still haven't been able to unlock my free supercar.Ubisoft screwed the pooch again...like right after you release one broken game you decide to release another how do you do this. It's like the level of glitches and broken code in new vegas, but without the modability. The game feels like alot of ubisofts other racing games as well but combined all recycled ideas to creat a steaming pile of ""idea"".The crew gold gives you a whole what 16 extra cars, for an extra $25. Think about that now that is alot of money for something i would consider what should be the size of one car pack. The crews Vehicle selection, what a fun topic. They seem to pick alot of old musclecars, some new muscle cars, some exotics, and 2 tuners..... a 370Z and an R34. No subaru's, no mitsubishi, no hondas, and no toyotas ""not even a supra, a legendary car"". Like do you hate imports that aren't considered exotics. If you do buy it wait a year until the price drops significantly, then also wait for a steam sale.			"

Introduction:An open world MMO racing game. For what was presented and explained the game is great and got the job done. For how much devs were needed to created something like this a lot of things should have been different. Seems like they took more time on the map than the cars what you can do with them. Pros:Great graphicsHuge mapGreat wheel settingsGood netcodeGood story/SP missionsCons:Not a good amount of cars to choose from (compared to Forza Horizon 2 and others)Low max levelOnce you're done with the campaign there isn't much to do except race others and try to get other carsMoney is too hard to get compared to how much cars costSometimes you won't see another player for 1+ hoursConclusion:Overall it is a solid racing game but there are some things that I would have liked to see. Maybe wait for discounts.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  "

												This game is supposed to be an MMO but it hardly feels like it. There's really nobody to play with. When I try to play a mission in ""co-op"" it says there is nobody in my session. Also I can't see anybody on the map which is just...weird. This game is just single player in multiplayer...which means you have a single player game that you can only play online. This game is far from what it was advertised as. They showed us trailers which had multiple people playing together as a team but in reality not even a single bit of that happens. I can't even make a crew with my friend because it is bugged. I suggest staying away from this yet another bad release from Ubisoft.			"

												""there's a difference between actual difficulty, and things you can't do anything about."" -VGDlike forcing you to do an unskippable mission that's just a badly designed ad for their new game. In which you have to get right next to an enemy for 10 seconds, when he has a faster car, and flashbangs that make you swerve off the road even when you slam on the brakes immediately. You also only have 3 minutes to catch him even if you can still see him, so if you mess up you have to restart. and if you mess up in the begining you can't restart until after you get the prompt to pick your abilities (which you will have to pick again after you restart). Oh, and it stops you mid chase to pick out those useless abilities, then throws you back into a high speed chase with no warning when you exit. even after I beat that mission it just made me lose interest in the game.

Posted: March 2, 2015
												The Crew is a game with so much potential that it actually upsets me playing it at points. There are a few main points of contention I have with the game.#1. The car list.Maybe there were licensing issues or something along those lines but the car list in this game is a massive disappointment. If you're making a game set in the entirity of the US give us some good American cars. I'd love to see classics like your C2 or C3 Corvettes, Pontiac Trans Am, Impalas, '60s Mustangs and even weird obscure stuff like a Buick Grand National. Another thing is that for a game released in late 2014 all the 'new' cars seem to be a few years old. For example you have a 2010 Camaro, a 2010 Challenger, a 2010 370Z, a 2010 Continental Supersports, a 2009 Corvette ZR1, a 2010 BMW Z4, A 2011 M5, a 2010 Focus RS, a 2011 Mustang, a 2012 V8 Vantage,a 2010 Viper, a 2011 Grand Cherokee, a 2011 F150 Raptor and a 2011 McLaren 12C. Maybe it was due to a lengthy dev time but it just seems strange to have a new racing game with a car list this slightly dated. Another thing that annoys me about the car list is that there is an R34 GT-R V-Spec that is Left Hand Drive, they only ever made them RHD that's why Americans who are into ""JDM"" (That's another rant for another time) go crazy for them.#2. The customisation.The vehicle customisation in this game is odd in that it's very in depth but also very limited. An example would be that I can put a stripe on my car but I can't change the colour of that stripe. All I want is a purple Camaro with a green stripe to give other players their daily dose but because of the arbitrary restrictions in the customisation menus I can't. All they had to do was emulate Forza or one of the PS2 era NFS games but Ivory Tower screwed that up.#3. The vehicle classes.When this game was hyped in pre release and during the beta it was shown that every car could be used in every class (Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Circuit) but when the game was released there were restrictions and limitations as to what car can be used with what class. For example a Golf GTI can only be used in Street spec which sucks because Street spec is garbage. A Dirt or Perf spec GTI would be fantastic but it can't happen because the game says so.#4. The Physics.Not necessarily the driving physics, they're fine but they do start out pretty terrible (they improve as your car improves) but the crash physics and impact physics are screwed up beyond belief with my cars commonly performing physically impossible maneuvers. Another thing that isn't entirely physics related is that during the start of every race an animation plays where you cars rear wheels spin even if you have a front or all wheel drive car, as someone who likes detail in their driving games this upsets me greatly.#5. Crew Credits.They're a currency you buy with real money. Need I say more?#6. The ""MMO"" aspect.This game is not an MMO. Ubisoft are lying to you, it might be multiplayer but it is 8 people per server and with a map this large you are spread out most of the time and barely have any interaction. The 'Never Drive Alone' tag was a lie as I spent most of my hours in this game driving alone.What this game needs is a sequel made by more competent devs and with more attention to the little details. It also shouldn't be marketed as an MMO because it isn't.			"

												Thinking about buying this game? Don't. Unless you plan on playing with a few friends, this game is absolutely horrible.CONS: 60% of the campaign you're not allowed to play with friends.Bots have PERFECT handeling, I mean P.E.R.F.E.C.T. handeling, making for extremely frustrating gameplay.The amazing ""always online"" gameplay is not entirely there. Sure there it's online but it's not what they make it out to be.The bronze silver gold ranking for races are absolutely wonkers. For example, I was first place 94% of the race (according to the end race results), and by the finish of the race I had 10 seconds on the 2nd place runner. I not only had to restart a million times, but I had to make the other bots crash for me to get in first. I got a bronze medal.Vehicle customization is not there what-so-ever. Most vehicles have near to no body kits, and it costs money out the♥♥♥♥♥to make your cars look cool.PROS:Game is pretty. Not gorgeous, but pretty.Police chases are mediocre at best. "

I bought the Gold Edition becuase i have seen the game on YouTube and knew that this game was made for those who both like good stories and cars. The story in The Crew™ is probably something I've never seen before. With a lot of action in this game, I could easily give this a 10/10! And for the extra feeling of driving a real car, buy the Logitech g27 Racing Wheel. I highly recommend this beautiful game.			"

												To be honest, i've been waiting a game like this since NFS Most Wanted. An openworld racing, where you can free-drive even with your friends and its not full arcade play. You need to get used to it if you wanna play it seriously & smoothly. I can say that this is GOTY for me. Story line is not bad for a racing game, eventhough it was a bit rush-end. About Gold edition : It gives you some amount of Crew Credits (Not worth what you pay), Season pass and some cars like Ferrari, Dodge RAM etc. In my opinion, you don't need to buy gold edition if you don't mind about Crew Credits (Which you can use buying cars and kits if you don't have enough cash in game) Just buy the normal version + season pass, would be enough.10/10 would buy again.

												after speaking with 3 different ubisoft techs, i am still able to not play this game, even though I have a great computer to run it on. Also heard that before the last update, it was running great and now most people cannot even get the game to start. CMON ubisoft, stop screwing this up!!!!! dont waste your money. The beta was awesome but its not worth it if you cant play the damn game!			"

												If you like to drive forklifts too fast (rear wheel steering), this is your game. Worst driving experience i've ever felt...I have been playing race games on a serious note since grand turismo for ps1...this is a disgrace to race fans.The game has amazing graphics and a beautifuly large map. Outside of those two things the game leaves everything to be desired if you love racing games. I couldn't even force myself to enjoy the driving experience.			"

												The Crash: Won't Run EditionIt took me about three hours just to get this game running. Upon hitting play it would get stuck when installing ""inshelper.exe"". Finally after getting the game to run it only took me about 5 minutes to be able to reproduce crashes regularly. This game has been out for almost a year and I can reproduce crashes five minutes into the main story.  There were also numerous random crashes. I thought this would be a good game. I really wanted it to be. But there is no game here. just a lot of restarting and crashing. 0/10 would not crash again			"

												Overall... It is good game. But it looks like devs hired few pigs from EA because you will find in game content you have to buy to be able to use. It is not just disgusting begging for your money but it is unethical and also immoral. It reminds me NFS MW 2013 where you found the car you want to drive and the game pop up you the store page. That is unforgivable. What will be next? You want to grab this weapon dropped by dead enemy in some FPS? It will pop up the store with DLC in your basket. I really don´t understand why i buy games in these days. To pay twice and more times to have complete game? I don´t think so.			"

												The Crew is an open world racing game from 2014. It was developed by Ivory Tower and Ubisoft Reflections. Published by Ubisoft, the game recreated a cut down version of North America where the player can partake in many activities including a story and free roaming. The Story centres around the main character Alex. He is being chased by the cops. His brother Dayton is the leader of an organisation called the 5/10 motor club. When they are meeting together a car pulls up and Dayton is shot and later dies. Alex is arrested and and convicted because of a corrupt FBI agent with ties to the 5/10's. Five years later Alex is offered a deal by an agent called Zoe to be released on the condition that he agrees to expose the FBI agent's corruption. Driven by his need to find out the truth behind his brother's murder Alex infiltrates the 5/10 organisation and climbs his way towards the top with help from the FBI. The story takes Alex across all the USA in his quest to find the truth.The Crew: Wild run is an expansion to the original game giving it a complete graphical overhaul and adding weather effects, motor bikes and monster trucks. The story missions of the crew have more than 20 hours of content. The missions mainly include different types of races and time trials not to mention the raid missions where you have to hit all the boxes before time runs out. There are also skill markers all over the map to make your free roaming more interesting. The skills can be: follow the driving line, see how fast you can go, also there is one where you have to hit the markers. Besides the main story there are many races marked on the map and some go for over one hour.I found the game really fun to play, both the story missions and the other challenges scattered about the map. The graphics were pretty good and the difficulty was not too hard. I found the best way to save money was to use one car for all the story missions as every challenge you accomplish gives your car performance upgrades. One annoying thing about the game is that it is always online so if you lose the internet you will get kicked from the game. Annoying if you have bad internet. I played the game with an Xbox controller for Windows and was quite satisfied. There are some bugs in the game like wild life being able to knock cars around by touching them and people just running around in circles. Apart from this the game was quite polished. The game also has the quick travel feature so you don't have to travel where you have already been. Apart from a few bugs and server issues I give this game:7.3/10			"

												In this particular piece of ""Car game"" style, you find yourself working for the special task force behind some bad apples inside the FBI. As younger brother of the leader of the 510 gang ""mi life be like uhhhh aaaahhh (everyone remember the song from fast and furious right), you just saw him be killed right after the drop on a meeting under a brigde( only he dosen't fell like a trap). U got planted, got locked up for 5 years and now, you're back on the street. Leveling up your rides for almost type of terrain out there, you progress as passing to a variety of challenges and side missions, besides the quest line missions itself.Watch out for other runner yet, they still on the ""Crash course"" when running against or cruising the cities (a shame indeed). It's like THAT old game, but with multiplayer now.11/10 must own this one guys, for real.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The fun that this game has swept me off my feet. The multiplayer is fantastic and same with singleplayer. I had expected this game to be a bit jaggedy at release but it has been the smoothest release I have seen. As of this reveiw I have played 15 hours in 3 days after it's release. This is coming from someone that is constantly very busy, I would stay up late and wake up early to find time to play this. I love the racing dynamics and graphics. The map is giant and beautiful and the detail in every city (except Santa Fe?). I love the fast travel and train/plane traveling. It is so much easier then driving forever to get somewhere because the map is so freaking big! This game is a must buy not for just racing lovers but to anyone with a PC.10/10			"

												There are car games out there that look better, sound better and handle better, but none of them can stand up to The Crew's sheer pleasure and romance of the open road.The Crew is the finest driving - not racing - game of 2014 and probably the very best this tiny subgenre has to offer. Outside of the baffling and bafflingly stupid plot, the game serves up an idealized approximation of the life of a car enthusiast who has nothing better to do but buy great cars, drive them to hell and back... and then drive them some more. With literally thousands of miles to wander across on a map reportedly close to five times the size of Just Cause 2's, The Crew is a paradise for free drivers and explorers, a game that makes the hours pass by at alarming speed in all senses of the word.If you've dreamed of cross-country road trips, this is as close (and cheap) as it gets. If you loved Test Drive Unlimited and its oddball, mildly disappointing sequel, you should stop reading this and buy The Crew right now as it is essentially Test Drive Unlimited 3 in all but name.

												Think of it's as need for speed: most wanted (2005) except the story is good, the map is huge, and it's online. Bear at mind there is a few issues with the servers regarding random disconnects at the time of this review but should improve over next week or so. There isn't a pay to win system as far as I can tell. You could buy a Laferria and still be smoked by any car that's spec out proprely as well as the skill points which have to be earned.It's a strong solid reccomedation on my book if you like racing games or you just want to travel coast to coast with your friends.

I have had to repeat some missions 10+ times to be successful. It almost seems like you are meant to do a race until you get gold everytime. If you like racing games with good customization, MMO's or The NFS series you might enjoy it. If you dont like getting headaches and slamming your keyboard stay far far away.			"

												This is going to be very long, but I am very passionate about this. Long story short, I do not think this game is worth $60+ I would consider it closer to a $30-$40 game. Very stable, especially for Ubisoft, and I enjoyed myself.When this game was first announced at E3, I was so excited. It appeared to be close to the game I'd been hoping for years ago. I have always been a fan of racing games, and over the last few years I've been underwhelmed by the options on PC. I was quick to pre-order The Crew despite my displeasure with Ubisoft and Watch_Dogs especially. When I played the Beta for The Crew, I was met with a stable game which was nice, but there were little things that bothered me. First and foremost was their approach to many of the landmarks of the US. I live in Las Vegas, so once I finally got there, I was underwhelmed. I feel like GTA San Andreas had a better looking Vegas than this game does. I then noticed that Mazda Laguna Seca was on the map also. Laguna Seca is one of my favorite Tracks ever, so I had to see it. After my initial woes with Las Vegas, I was mildly worried. My fears came true, and this point I was legitamately upset.  If you are going to take the time to put a track as Iconic as Laguna Seca in the game, at least do it justice. The Corkscrew, a sweeping S curve, with a 3 story drop, is flat in the game. plus the bump just before the corner turns into a jump at any speed greater than about 50 mph. I understand they can't capture every single part of the US but for tracks, especially those like Laguna Seca, at least make them like the real thing. Car selection is very limited comapred to most other racing titles, but you can go through the entire game with your starter car. there really is no need to spend money at all. I beat the game only spending 2200 on mirrors for my Ferrari, because the Italian flag decal didn't really fit withthe rest of the car. All class upgrades are paid for and individula parts are awarded from skill challenges. unless you want to drive a different car, or make the ones you have prettier, there is absolutely no need to buy anything. I am not very ggod at games in general so I found some missions to be very frustrating. The takedown missions in particular were an annoyance for me. trying to chase someone down and inflict enough damage was very difficult for me. As were the Smash missions, hit a certain number of container within the time limit. it would take me over an hour just for those missions, mostly due to physics (more on that later). The story was pretty much what you would expect from a racing game. Not super indepth, lots of random missions that you have to do with no real explanation of why, but it does have a rather logical progression, and moves at a decent pace. I played through the entire campaign solo, and the only time i interacted with other players was occasionally having a head on collision mid corner. now that I beat the story I might look more into Faction missions, but for now, I found the online function to be more of an annoyance than anything useful.  Overall, I would say that from a game play standpoint, I wasn't really disappointed.  From a technological stand point I was.... I'll say satisfied. In 24.6 hours of play the game only crashed 3 times. As far as servers go, the only time I had trouble connecting was when they were performing server maintanence. Visually, this is actually a very good looking game. If it weren't for the 60 fps lock, and the strange Depth of Field effects I wouldn't have any complaints. Honestly, playing at max settings (motion blur and depth of field off) I was playing at 3140 x 2160 on my  GTX 980 at a stable 60 fps, and gpu usage was only at around 70%. I would have liked to be able to fully utilize 144 Hz that my monitor is capable of, but for whatever reason they locked it to 60. Not a deal breaker for the vast majority of consumers, but it was mildly irksome for me. Normal road driving is quite satisfying, once I turned driving assists to hardcore, I was quite content with the handling. The collision detection baffles me though. there is no consistency as far as what constitutes a full crash and what is just a glancing blow. I had times that I would ram into the back of a pedestrian vehicle by more than half of it, and my car would just ""glitch"" to one side and I wouldn't lose more than a couple mph. other times there would be a couple of feet between my car and the pedestrian vehicle, and I would crash. I tried to figure out why, but never really could. The most ridiculous aspect of the physics is most apparent once you unlock the raid class. These vehicles are designed to go offroad, over large objects, and jumps. Every time I tried to go off a jump, the physics would react in a way that I can only call alien.  I could get practically no distance, or I would have insane nose up manuvers. worst of all was the tendency for the car to spring up to one side if only one tire went over a large rock or object. If your vehicle goes past a 90 degree angle the game treats it as a crash, even if you end up landing on your wheels again. If you did end up making it off the jump well, the game trys to keep you flat, most of the time, so more times than not I would end up taking an awkward bounce and spin out. This was completely unnatural to me. and it was so random I couldn't compensate for it. If the game was trictly on road, this wouldn't be a problem, but there are so many missions, like the smash missions I mentioned before, where this comes into play, and it is very frustrating. At the end of the day, I was able to work around these issues, and beat the missions, but I could never really achieve the score I wanted because the physics would mess me up. But i do have to give them credit, not once did i experience a glitch, much less a game breaking one. Just 3 freeze and crashes that I can't really explain, but since it is always online, server based, I didn't lose any progress.Overall I would give The Crew a 7 out of 10. It held my attention the whole time, and I found satisfaction in completeing missions. the overall experience was quite good, it had it's faults, but nothing was ever major enough to put me off of the game entirely. I would say wait for it so go on sale for 33% or more, and you'll get your moneys worth. For that reason, I do recommend  this game.			"

												Wild Run addon is disappointing to me. For cost of half of basic game you get in fact nothing. Oh yea, you can still pay further and buy motorbikes but even this is not possible straight on Steam - you are redirected to other page which does not belong to Steam. I am not a die hard fan of this game so I am not into spending tens of hours to slowly earn game's coins to be able to ride a bike. At least one bike should be accessible straight by buying the DLC, otherwise, for me it is waste of money.And one more thing: why the game does not turn off when I quit? Steam hour counter for the game still works and I can't get rid of it until next PC restart, so in fact hours count spent with this game is false.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hey, this is the best open world driving sim so far. It's like TDU but better, prettier, more exciting. I would also really like to see usable Petrol Stations, Motorbikes as well as radio playing my own mp3 songs, GPS that looks like the real one, playable slot machines. I hope future DLCs will bring us some of these.			"

												I would recommend this game for the driving, seamless map integration, various skill objectives and missions, and all around car tuning and handling.I would not recommend this game for its useless PVP system, its repetitive grind, no end-game benefits, its censorship, the absurd story, or its custom car designs and micro-transaction model.Overall, if you enjoy racing games and play them often, this game ranks up there with some of the greats. But, on the down side, there is no inclination of ultimate purpose other than to repeat what you have already done in the past. Not having a beneficial PVP or Faction vs. Faction system takes away one of the main key factors that would keep you playing this game, rewards. There is simply no motivating factors in the game that would make you stockpile vehicles or outdo yourself on the skills circuit, unless you have absolutely no life or are a completionist.6/10 "

I'd recomend this game to those who enjoy arcade racing, but will warn them of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot line.			"

												People say a lot about the Crew. That is good and fun and others swear that it is next to terrible. For me the Crew has been a lot of fun, but I have no interest in being with a group of people tearing up the country-side. I personally like the idea of the crew and the changing of car styles and it forces you to play with all of the spec's (Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, and Circuit) through the Campaign. Overall if you like driving around a massive open world in any car you like doing random skills, races and occasional pvp it is a lot of fun and worth the cash. ---->The campaign in general is alright, it is enough to keep you interested in how the characters work as a whole, but it nothing compared to Ubisoft's other story lines. It was written by the same writer of Red Dead Redemption, but was given a limited window in which to write it. The story feels rushed and a little bit like the fast and Furious, but it is a racing game and the Fast and Furious franchise really set the cliche and standard for many years to come. It is best to think of the Campaign as an interesting Tutorial rather than any form of story.---->The game play is very fun in my opinion. In the open world you can drive anywhere you want with ease and have a multitude of things to do along the road trip. With five different types of cars you can go anywhere. The races are fairly easy in solo, but can pose a challenge in Co-op. The servers are lacking players though, because of the recent political and social mishaps that Ubisof has had, but I have had no problem getting into races in PVP. There is a large gripe about the handling model with this game. *IMPORTANT* It is a little difficult to understand, but this is an arcade racer with a logical handling model. The handling is actually quite realistic; its clunky, difficult, and sometimes very difficult to control, but this is how real cars work at high speeds. (I have two performance muscle cars and race them on the weekends, so trust me when I say they can turn at speed worth anything. One is a 1970 Camaro SS Z28 and the other is a 1970 Dodge Charger R/T) Use the brake and don't just slam on the gas the while time is the key to racing effectively. ---->The Customization is more than extensive (except on the Circuit cars but they are supposed to be race cars so I get that.) I have had a lot of fun personalizing my cars to be something that I like and find attractive. I can happily say that they have attempted to find looks and styles that suit everyone's interests. The visual parts can all be bought so you roll out of the tuner with a badass looking Mustang, Camaro, or whatever else. Althought, the performance parts are sometimes frustrating to acquire, but are rewarding after a challenge.---->My frustrations;-The occasional lack of players in the open world-The tiny chance of level 50 parts-The traffic spawn distance is very short sometimes giving you no chance to dodge them when you are ripping along the desert at 250+ mph. -The expense of some of the parts. (Now this is a little bit more specific. Because it is so easy to make money it doesn't really matter anyway.)-The fact that there isn't a circuit spec for the Agera R.---->My Joys;-The customization for the cars-The little things, like overheating brakes and over-spin.-The graphics for the cars and damage models.-The auto-repair for the exterior of the car so you aren't forced to look at a car the is half destroyed.  -The Performance tweaks to the driving models that are a little difficult to notice.-The Spec differences and play style choices.-The ease at which you can make money.All in all it is very good. Not perfect by any means, but enjoyable. Worth the money, you ask? There isn't an easy way to answer that. For me I have played a lot and plan to play more so it was for me, but for others who knows. It is really one of those; ""I love it"" or ""I hate it"" games. The hype it got really hurt it. I like it better than GTA five, way more. So if you want it, get it and play with it. Take the challenges with pride and just at least give it a try before judging. My friends and I love it. "

												Let me begin by saying I do not have much experience with racing games, I am not a big racing fan. With this in mind I will continue my review.  I really liked the Crew, I have played it a little bit and I took place in the Wild Run beta testing. Overall I would say the game is a fun racing game, and it has some beautiful, and amazing environments in game. Driving coast to coast is an experience, and there is even a miniature version of my city in this tiny version of America. I will admit the actual driving can be a little clunky at times, but I feel that the other features and all the crew based gameplay makes up for it.  I have not played the Crew much, but I can at least say that there is not much it compares to. I haven't played many open world racing games like the crew, but I can say this, it seems well made, especially for a Ubisoft game. If you are still reading this far into my review, you should know that I recommend the Crew to street racing fans, and fans of open world racing games. That being said I must warn you that the Crew comes with Uplay, it is a Ubisoft game, with all that entails.			"

												There's not too much to say about this game, but I feel obligated to write a review after enjoying ~150hrs of it. The Crew is an open world arcade style driving game with nice graphics and a whole lot of space to cruise around. There are around 70+ cars I believe, and that number increases every month. The game has minor updates pretty regularly, with a large update happening every few months.I'd say it's worth the $30 price tag, assuming you don't mind the lack of realism, but ideally you'll want to wait for a sale.I'm willing to answer any further questions in the comments, and will update this review if necessary.

												It's been fun to play, especially since the last few NFS games have turned me off of the series.  My only complaint is there is currently no way to start a new career.  If you finish the story line you're stuck re-racing stuff you've already done with the only object of maxing the stats of each of your cars.  I don't really have an interest in PvP.  Whiners in first person shooters ruined online gaming for me so I tend to play locally or only with a few friends.			"

												I've almost never raced in this racing game. It's a driving experience. Whenever you want to feel comfy, you get a friend who also plays this game and drive around the US. Put a cool music in the background and enjoy. After the recent graphical update it looks way better and runs better too. The only DLC I would consider buying would be a Europe map or something. That would be nice to drive around.			"

												Very well done game. Graphics are done smoothly, and the better the PC you have, the better the graphics. It does take a bit of power for ultra, although. Gameplay is very fun and done nicely. PROS:Every car has potential and can be used for many different things. So if you find a well rounded car you really like, there won't be that ""Aww crap, it's outdated now and I need to replace it"" issue.Gameplay and graphics are smooth.Vehicle handling is done very well. Some games have very choppy driving experiances. This game does NOT!The fact you can play solo, with a team, and/or with your friends is very nice. All things are pretty much doable in either of these 3 different ways.Bugs and glitches are very rare in this game.CONS:As stated in many reviews, season pass does not include all content/DLC.Some cars, like the Skyline, are a bit OP when it comes down to it. You can obtain this car very early on for a very cheap price. It has the option to do any spec, and performs like an absolute boss. Why is this a con? I feel like due to the handling and how open the variations are, it should be tuned down a tad. No reason for an early starting car to be able to match an end game car. Plus, you may find yourself stuck on this car and not wanting to use any other car which can take some fun out of the game.If you do not own Wild Run, Ubisoft tends to force it in your face whenever it can. Constant adds, constant reminders, and the fact that all the WR DLC races are all over your map as listed races and events, but noooo, can't do them till you buy our DLC type crap.The option to use real currency to buy things. Many different reasons why this is bad. Once you are max level, have all the races done, the game does slow down a ton. Seems like there isn't a lot to do at that point. Gets very repetative and a tad boring. May discourage players at that point.OVERALL:Do I recommend this game? I do. Many hours of fun! Nothing like doing a 2+ hour race with friends on Skype! If a game can give you one hell of a good time, laughs with friends, and make a night into an awesome night, then yeah the game is worth it. The fact that I listed more cons than pros is not a final determination. The pros listed certainly outweigh the cons by a longshot. Plus, everyones opinions are different. Some might find the cons not a problem. This game keeps updated really well. They patch it pretty frequently with fixes and content. I have yet to come across any game breaking glitches or bugs. I have discovered a few glitches, but had a ton of fun with them. For example I have found a few areas that if you carefully drive into the water, you can drive underneath and have a blast! If you do chose to purchase this game, I hope you find your buy worth it and that you have fun as me and my friends have!			"

												Let me just say, the animators at Ivory Tower really pulled it off. This game is full of any form of racing action: time trials, races, takedowns, chases etc. It has an unravelling plot design, and a huge plot twist waiting for players. In depth missions and public events so you can meet new people and recruit them to your ""Crew"". Full customization of your car in different specs, or classifications, of vehicles.  The only problems I came across while playing was that the physics could be a little off. Overall, it was an incredible game and any fans of racing games will fall in love.			"

												No one is going to read my review anyways so I will be totally brief...THAT GAME IS JUST AMAAAZING!IMO, it is the BEST modern arcade rading game! (I don't really like the modern arcade racing games, so I kept playing Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005 till pretty much 2 years ago LOL)Yes, it does have A FEW downsizes (by the way, if you are going to complain about the physics, be a man and just change it to hardcore. The ""easy"" mode from the Crew is not very satisfying tbh)One of the few horrible things with The Crew is the post mission HUD. It is just so stupid to have to wait many seconds on a screen about a challenge (mainly if you are under a police pursuit) just to find out you earned 250B. We should be able to just bash Enter/A(for controller) and go quickly through the menu.Aaand one thing that drives me mad are the police pursuits. Sometimes if you hit the rear of a police car, you just get stuck (you cant even reverse, the game bugs. Sometimes that happens even at stationary cars when you are NOT the most wanted) and that you cant just turn around and reverse during a pursuit without being arrested. "

												First of all, Use Voice chat, vent, skype TS, whatever, just communicate with people. Probably one of the best arcade racer I've ever experienced. that's something.Let's get something straight. Arcade racers are racing games that have selective physics to allow fun things to happen.If you are like me, someone who clocked 1000+ hours into Gran Turismo, played every racing game from F-Zero,CTR,Top gear,F1 simulators, to Racing lagoon. you don't expect anything to ever blow your mind again.Heck, after NFS after NFS, I started to believe arcade racers have nothing to deliver.This proved me wrong. Fantastically crafted balance of doing what's expected of a racing game, and taking itself seriously without being pretentious. > PhysicsThe physics are well crafted to do what it's supposed to, The hitboxes are somewhat forgiving as they will let you scrape past a crash or dodge trees from time to time, (unlike Forza where entering a corner wrong is kinda...fatal) It doesn't make you OCD about keeping your car in control like GT, and is both a relaxing and exciting experience.> VisualsIf you have a good PC, the visuals are quite decent, the topper is the cinematic value of an active racetrack. The game is light and easy enough for you to enjoy the cranes and planes, and steam leaks, strategically placed to block you from seeing stuff ahead is a nice touch.> StoryThe storyline? I didn't care for it at first, but it started to get better, unexpectedly good for something so cliche and dead on hollywood scriptwriting theories, The characters have a lot of depth for a racing game. It demonstrates there's nothing wrong with cliches, if it's done right. The end feels fulfilling and I'd totally get DLC for some of the character side storiesThe game is meant to be played together, the story is written so you can talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about it. It's not groundbreaking but it does the job right, something I haven't seen in racing games in a long time.(Willing suspension of disbelief regarding ""driving fixes problems"" is required. though much less than a michael bay movie)> GameplayIt's broken the line of pathetic cops game after game, where you can just ""go vroom vroom really fast"" and get away. It's a fantastic breath of fresh air. The cops actually do something. They will stop you if you drive stupidly behind them, you react to their radio as it gives you clues when they're going to ram you, and you'll have to take risks to get rid of them (not just ""don't crash""). You can see that they're programmed to make the chase fun, forcing you to react and think of ways to taking them out, (which is not no longer a fancy dressing on a cake, it's required.) If you like challenging cops, this is going to be fun. I'm still expecting the difficulty to increase as people learn that you cant just get away by driving in a straight line. you know, the same people who ask Is it realistic? no, you aren't probably ever going to get away from realistic cops.If you are finding it too hard, you probably aren't voice chatting enough.The Missions are actually fun and challenging, there is enough substance in the car handling to make different skill challenges enjoyable, and the reward of making your car a bit faster after every race is great. Those crash missions are great fun, you have to plan and execute crashes giving a nice buildup to a climatic crash.I hate catchup bonuses, But I'm going to make this an exception, It's right for the type of game it is.>MMOIt's the best way to halt the piracy of the game, This was going to happen sooner or later, and this is a really good first step for racing games.For an MMO, this is really well designed, I'm surprised at the MMO elements that they've got working nicely in the game, (like the RNG god) They're missing like, crafting, (Player designed parts? *wink wink*) but that's ok. but The game is well designed with so much to do for every type of gamer in the bartle test. I've found myself navigating a rocky offroad mountian climb with my friend, pushing him when he's stuck, and screaming when i was so close to getting over that rock before tumbling down. The open world is done right.You're all worring about the cash aspect? I feel what they're doing now is perfect, Yes cash helps you get stuff, but to get the end game gear, you gotta get your hands dirty grinding the RNG god for platinum parts. so yeah, money will give you access to some cars, but any car can be tuned to the same performance tier, This is probably the correct pay model, It respects customers enough to not be pay to win, I hope activision keeps it that way.The game is much more enjoyable with people to talk to, It's really how it's designed.The drawback is there's only half a dozen people in your session, so it's sort of an mmo with very small servers. But let's be honest, 1-- players infront of the HQ isn't driveable, especially with how much you guys care about traffic laws. )and the number will probably increase after launch day fad is over when the server is more free""It's not free of glitches, but to be honest i'm surprised at how well it's working for a game a couple days from launch day? I'm starting to hate Activision a little less, just for publishing this.>SoundI mentioned to my team time after time how good the Dodge Viper sounds, what pisses me off is the music, But luckly i'm on a PC, so I can just play whatever I want in the background. The sound's what it needs to be.Tips> (Tl:dr version)- Any car can finish the game- get a crew and voice chat outside of game- accept that this isn't ""realistic"" like F1, GT, and Forza- prepate a written a list of insults for the police- expect some disconnects and patches near launch date- Don't tune a 2nd car until you get 40, then buy the most expensive kit starter.- Best way to farm for money is PvP, don't grind jumps like I did.- Don't try to gold stuff unless you are stuck at a level, Platinum parts unlock at lv50.- Your mother is a nice person, okay? now stop crashing me out in PvP.

												I love the size of this game. Nothing can prepare you for how big it is. The story line is rather shallow and pointless so far (I have yet to complete it). The driving has a mostly arcade feel to it but is not too insane. The cars are a lot of fun to drive and there is plenty to do. The game is very pretty to look at. Even at only medium settings. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who liked to 2005 Need for Speed Most Wanted or Need for Speed Underground series.			"

												Edited for Wild Run and patches:Brief:Seamless cross-country racingGreat driving physicsDecent graphicsBeautiful interior details on every carWide system requirementsExcellent wheel and controller supportJapanese voice track makes the terrible story bearable -- The main character is voiced by the same actor as Keisuke Takahashi from Initial D.Very stable, with some minor bugs -- 4K resolution Camera Mode tends to crash the game or forget shaders during rendering.Could almost outcomfy Euro Truck Simulator 2, if there wasn't such a heavy emphasis on driving full speed all the time.Motorcycles just got a physics update, giving them more realistic handling and the ability for dirtbikes to do big powerslides and scrub off jumps, now taking just as much skill to drive fast as the cars. This increases the fun quotient of driving a bike, but makes it harder to compete against an equally-tuned car. Addendum:The whole point is to hit level cap and grind PVP or faction missions with friends, the early game is extremely tedious and limits the amount of connectivity the player has. The first couple of hours in Freeride and you'll see AI driving around in place of real humans. After you get to level 2 or so, they disappear and are replaced with humans, but only if your NAT is good. This game uses a console-style system to deal with multiplayer, so if your home network is not properly set up, you will find it to be a completely dead game, which it very much isn't. You are also kept from accessing your Season Pass bonus cars until after you reach  Level 10. I would have liked to complete the tutorial with the Cadillac Eldorado, but it will be a couple hours of gameplay before you can even touch those vehicles.Base controller settings are garbage -- Make sure to mess with the options to make driving comfortable. Primarily, the speed sensitivity should be turned down, and if you have a newer controller, turn the deadzone off. Not much content - that said, it is a RACING game, and it has all kinds of that. PVP now has multiple gametypes, and the car selection is much better than at release. Some promised features still not yet in gameSTILL NO REAR-VIEW MIRRORS IN COCKPIT VIEWAbsolutely cringeworthy plot no matter what language you listen to it in.tl;dr: Ridiculous fun with friends if you can stomach the kusoge elements, overbearing and far too long tutorial, and odd glitch. There simply isn't anything like it.			"

												Is this game worth playing? Yes. If you like a average story which is something you just have an addition cause you do the same thing on every mission anyways. Yes. If you are patient enough to fiddle around with Uplay and fix all the issues you'll haveYes. If you like a game which only way of saying ♥♥♥♥ you, you are not going that way is by ruining the physics (hilarious and pathetic at the same time)Yes. If you like racing games, the controls feel like the average arcade racer which is not a bad thing considering how ♥♥♥♥ing hard it is to drive around at more than 90MPH without any handling upgradesYes. If you like to ♥♥♥♥ around with your friends while exploring almost every part of the US until you realise you done goofed cause you should've played the missions cause even the ♥♥♥♥ing NPCs can outrun you in the areas you are supposed to visit laterConclusion: This is a really, really fun game. I had some issues at first, weren't minor. Ubisoft support wasn't helpful at all but that doesn't change the fact that this game is fun with friends or atleast the right people. Grab yourself a Perf spec car and ♥♥♥♥ around near LV dragracing random people cause you can. Then drive to Michigan, Detroit and see the place where white rap started (8 Mile).If you were to drive from west coast to east coast following the laws of driving (speed, stop lights and such) you would lose around 4 hours and 30 minutes. If you were to drive at the highest speed your car is able to reach it would still take over 50 minutes. This game is huge. you should play it "

												They're giving it away for free right now, so you may as well give it a shot.Got it on sale, I definitely wouldn't buy it for full price. Graphics are pretty good, car exterior detail and rain are especially attention grabbing. The car sounds are really weird and probably a weak point-it sounds like they were synthesized rather than recorded. The game world is huge and the detail is pretty good considering the size, but it feels a lot emptier than any of the competition. The driving physics are pretty good and beginner-friendly and you can turn off the assists if you want. Nothing on the level of say, Forza Horizon but much better than Need For Speed 2015. The tuning is probably the biggest advantage-there are a ton of parts for every car. Bodykits, interiors, wheels etc and many cars have widebody versions in the ""Perf"" tuning spec. That brings me to the car selection. There are about 60, I think, plus their various tuning kits. This would be fine but the selection is a bit dumb- we get a Cadillac Escalade but no CTSV for instance. Attention to detail is where a lot of the cars fall apart-cockpit gauges are often off, or in some cases don't even work. You also can't sell off unwanted cars either which I don't get. The money system is annoying but not horrible. The game doesn't nickel and dime you that bad and you can make a lot doing skills and just drifting around, but the system is definitely skewed to try and get you to buy stuff. Cars especially are super expensive but you can test drive them before you buy which is nice. Parts are cheap though and handed out for free for doing skills.It's a fun game but the world feels a bit dead at times and a lot of car appearance and spec details are overlooked. You can get lost just driving around for a long time though, and you can turn off the road at any time. Pick it up while it's free or try the trial and wait for a sale.			"

												     Ubisoft hasn't had a very good track record this year. With buggy games like Unity, Watch Dogs, and even Far Cry 3, I can see why someone would be cautious about buying this game. From my experience in this game so far I am going to use one word to sum it up. L O V E. That's it. This game has so much to offer and I really think that Ubisoft saved the best for last this year. It has amazing graphics, people in the world with you, and a HUGE map and vast selection of cars to choose from. If you are a fan of open world games or racing games or all of the above, I hugely reccomend getting The Crew. To sum it up, there are some cons to this game, as it can be a little repetitive, but, it has an engaging story where you learn to feel for the characters and so many fun things to do.			"

												This game is great if you like racing games. It has many different cars to chose from and they all have ways of customizing them. You can drive across America. it takes an hour of driving to get from coast to coast(havent done this myself but I read that on reddit.) The beginning of the game has a lot of racing, but you can just drive and explore around the country if you want to. Its a lot of fun with friends, but its not required. There's a lot of stuff to do. it currently has a few bugs and the occasional server issue because of how recently it came out. 9/10			"

												With some initial rocky troubles with updates and stability, this game had me swinging from exhilarated to furious and back to exhilarated again.  Right now everything is working fine and its the best damn driving game i've played.I've been a major fan of the Need for Speed series, especially the free roaming, free agent types of Most Wanted and Hot Pursuit.  With those previous titles, they pioneered many features of free driving and competitive co-operative play i've enjoyed.  With The Crew, I get to experience all of that with added elements of full co-operative support, an unprecidentedly open free roam world, well balanced cosmetic and performance modifications.  I'm still getting into the game so i'm still looking forward to the real PvE and PvP experiences along with the action the faction system will bring.For now it definitely gets a thumbs up, though as with any launch title it will have bugs and problems, so be patient (or wait a while before you buy).

												It'd doesn't feel like an MMO. It has a few poorly designed UI elements that appear directly mid-screen while you are driving, which screws up the flow. The police are completely unrealistic. The storyline is one dimensional.But other than that I have no real bad things to say. I'm pretty well impressed and am having a lot of fun playing this game. Just driving around like a maniac is really entertaining. The only odd thing about this game is the players who don't want to race me in the open world. They are too busy getting to the next race. Also there is a few players who drive normal speeds and observe all traffic laws.Awesome, but I'm not going to do it. "

												I'll give it an 8.5. The cars you can customize drive better the further they are leveled up. I always drive alone as i can't get anyone to be on my Crew.I'm at level 35 on Pc version as of 12.6.14. Would be better if the cars didn't spin out so much when they get hit. Cops are annoying & sure bust you quick once your stopped. Would be better is the tires didn't spin so easiy when using nitrous. Some of the cars such as in the Infinity Challenge just can't grip even the road when they near their top speed,Who ever heard of a super car hydro-plaining within their operating designed limits, Would be better in there weren't so many wheel choices of the same rims in 3 colors, would be awesome if we could just powder coat the rims in our choice of colors. That would eliminate so many rim choices. The Crew is the best racing game since Driver San francisco & Need 4 Speed The Run for sure. I'm sure Need 4 Speed Franchise needs to get with the game & not be so limited in it's predictable game style of very limited customization choices. Nuff said			"

												""Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crewThey loving the crewOh, they loving the crewOh, they loving the crewThey loving the crewThey loving the crewThey loving the crewOooooh,""- Crew Love (Feat. The Weekend)Great arcade racing game! Not some serious Narcar game based on realisim. Not alot of cars, but that doesnt take away from the fact that you are probably going to spend alot of money on 1 car. It's going to take you a good while to aquire AT LEAST a 3rd car, assuming you dont spend CC on a better car. The map is really big. Long freeways/highways for showing off how fast your cars can actually go, and nice city streets for smaller races/drifting. The only problems i have with this game are that 1. Large sums of money are hard to come buy, especially  if you keep spending money on paint jobs and stickers.2. Connecting with your friends is a pain! For me at least. Either there are no other players being shown for me, or when i try to join my friends crew, it says he is already in one, which is claims is flase. Past those things though, its good fun to just freeroam in your $1000000 car though the USA!			"

												+Decent handling, Little too stiff for my liking, but it does the job.tons of interesting / unique environments / tracks to race inStory mode has good variety in gameplay (story mode lasts about 6 hours)can literally instantly warp to any location/event on the map (assuming you've driven to the area before)You and your friends can be in the same party while still playing different events or be at different locations.Grouping / playing with friends is super easy.Awesome, easy to use menus / interfaces-to have any chance at winning multiplayer matches, you'll need to grind a lot to upgrade your car (which can only done in solo-mode). If you don't improve your car level, you'll lose the race so bad you won't even see your oponent for 90% of the race.This means you will basically NEED to spend 6+ hours (on top of completing the story mode) trying to improve your cars doing repetitive tasks (hit the targets, drive as fast as possible, jump as far as possible, etc) until your cars are leveeld up) just to enjoy multiplayer races. These events, after the first few 3-4 times lose their fun value quick.I really dislike the car leveling system (at least as far as the multiplayer is concerned) and it's for this reason, I haven't had a chance to enjoy multiplayer and probably never will (I refuse to play X hours completing mundane tasks just as a prerequisite to compete against others in multiplayer.)All-in-all, it's a great game, especaially if you're into arcade racing. They really setup a nice framework and allow a lot of flexibility to encourage people to play in groups. If you hope to race against others in multiplayer, be prepared to do 6+ hours of grinding first.			"

												Well, i figured i might aswell write my first review as a review of this game. I just completed it today. Today being 4 days after i got it, and i've racked up just over 23 hours of playtime. And oh boy. Summed up, this game is essentially the result of throwing Test Drive Unlimited 2, Driver: San Fransisco and Need For Speed: Undercover intro a breeding pen together. Being a massive fan of TDU and the Driver series, i'd say that sounds pretty damn good. It has the exploration and collectibles of TDU2, the ""undercover ex-street racer who was jailed up but picked by the FBI to catch bad guys"" plotline, which i suppose is a mix of D:SF and NFSU, and then the attention to detail around the maps and customization of TDU2. The plotline is pretty short. Like i mentioned earlier, i completed the storyline within 23 hours, and that's with quite some extra time added into exploration. You could probably sprint trough the game in 17/18 hours. Though, the exploration is what makes this game so enjoyable. Like, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, there's a unicorn and a bigfoot walking around for you to almost run over in your Paris-Dakar specced muscle cars and circuit spec classic cruisemobiles. The map is large. Very, very large. It's basically the entire US, and even though it's downscaled, you'll still spend over an hour getting from one end of the map to the other. It's also surprisingly well detailed, with a ton of stuff to discover, like a giant ski jump to launch your car off, or 5 different race tracks, or wrecked cars, which is another thing very similar to TDU2. It's a good time if you enjoy cars and exploring♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh, and TD;LR if you can't be arsed to read my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review:  Ubisoft didn't ♥♥♥♥ up  "

												I genuinely like the crew as long as you make sure you purchase Wild Run this dramatically improves vehicle handling and adds motorbikes and monstertrucks to the mix as well as dynamic weather and visual improvements. The map scale is truely impressive and the car models are of very high quality making ownership of these cars a real joy to cruise around in. The sigleplayer Story expeience is always down to the wire with nailbiting races and the AI can screw up although not as much as a human will.The Multiplayer option is good and encourages competition as well as working together to finish that hard as balls mission.The in vehicle views and bonet views are very well done and add to the immersion.If I had anything negative to say it would be about inapp-purchases. NO Ubisoft NO. I want to be able to earn my vehicle and drive against players that have earned their new rides instead of people who can just buy the best vehicle and get all the advantages from that.PROS : Graphically stunning as long as you have Wild Run. Incredible scale and detail to the map it truly is MASSIVE! Vehicle Models are of the highest quality. A genuinely fun and exciting story fo the campaign (although generic)AI vehicles can screw up making it more realistic. CONS:INAPP-PURCHASES gives some players unfair advantage over a player who earns their vehicle in game . I don't expect to pay any more when Iv'e supposedly bought the whole game. Get rid of inapp-purchases for sanity's sake it cheapens the whole product.AI drivers can be TOO smart never missing corners and seemingly completing courses with ease they also recover way too quickly as opposed to the player who is heavily penalized for screwing up.

												I have literally never given a review for all the games I have ever played in my 23 years of living, last year I got into PC gaming. I purchased a g27 Logitech steering wheel and have been playing racing games mainly since then. To satisfy my ""free roam/buy cars"" itch I had been playing Test Drive Unlimited 2. Awesome graphics, Fun enough gameplay and hours of me crusing around Hawaii drinking beer and driving XD.I have read a HORRENDOUS amount of negative reviews about this game and since it was able to be played last night I havn't put it down, I dont know why it says 8.5 hours played. For one, the driving feels exactly the way I want a game like this to feel, I play other racing sims such at Assetto Corsa, WRC3, RBR and I will tell you, i would NOT want The Crew to play like that. WAY more fun being able to fly 120mph in an over powered 370z around corners and flying off rediculously over sized ramps (on the fly challenges are F***ING cool, you'll learn when you start playing) than it being on the ""Realistic/Simulator"" side. I mean seriously in those games you have to actually drop it to about 15mph around a sharp turn to keep your car in control. Do you REALLY want to be doing that in a NFS style game? No, it would get highly annoying.To those of you with a g27. This game works perfectly with it, 900* of rotation feels just right. Plently of tweaking options to make all your pedals feel just right, Force Feedback kicks just right with what your car is doing.There is alot more, just message me or comment for more questions.Must buy, 10/10, BAD A**.

												Ok, let me get started by telling you I'm not a big fan of race games. That being said I honestly think that The Crew is one of the best racing game experiences I EVER had to experience untill now. The way it lets you take the wheel and just gives you the ability to drive all across the states did it for me. Can I also mention that the graphics in this game are A M A Z I N G ! Really some of the best attention to detail I have seen in quite some time. For me hands down the Best racing game ever.			"

												For those that enjoy an arcade racing game, I would highly recommend you purchase this. The story missions are a lot of fun and you get hooked in very quickly.Multiplayer in an racing game in the sense of MMO system is knew and there are things, which need to be learnt and improved upon. However; for the money it's wroth your time and enjoyment.			"

												In overall its a very good game. It kinda feels like a Gta but only for cars. Heres some points that could be improved:- Add more cars- More modifications- The cops are overpower, especially when they chase you. What I mean by that is even if you got a 600 hp car they can catch up to you. Its impossible to ram them or put them out of ''service''- Fix the textures of building and stuff like that, it feels a little bit ''cheap'' compared to the cars graphics.- Add more civils and cars on the road.- Theres one thing I think is ridiculous is that you pass a cop at 300 miles/hour and they don't go after you but when you break a fence they chase the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.- Improve the AI intelligence.- Have been having this issue during the cinematic. I don't have any sounds.- There sould be some kind of heist that you could do. Like chasing after a armored truck to steel the money. Stuff like that.like I said its a very good game, it only needs some improvements. It has some potential.8,5/10 would keep playing.PS: sorry for my bad english at some points.			"

												The first game that i really didn't regret buying, it's the only game that takes me back through timeon my NFS: U days but 50x bettermy game rating: 9/10Pros:- Customizable Cars- Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, Circuit (NFS, Dirt, NFS Shift)- Open map ( The whole USA, it's just mindblowing )- No Loading screens when on the road, ( roads just keep going and going and going)- Landmarks ( i really love this, i'm learning new places in the game, featuring SALT FLATS! Even NASA rockets)- Long roads, stuffs are never ending, when you check the map it's filled with races waiting for you- the whole USA can be fitted on a 15-17GB game- nicely optimized, even the low settings look nice and runs in my laptop- has a story line- The Season pass cars are just WOW- replayable- The developers are active and listening to the community (forums)Betweeners:- few cars selection (FOR NOW, i know more cars are coming)- The concept of the ""crew"" is not really implemented strongly in-game- some server issues (FOR NOW, cuz i know they're still ironing the server side, hello it's still the 4th day of the game)- MMO is based on sessions, (you really don't see ALL the players online)- Somewhat short story line- Easy to reach max levelCONS:- The Cops- AI has obvious rubberbanding- The chat interface has litteraly no use (i can chat easier on steam/uplay chat)- Uplay-  no character customization- The radiowishes:- Photo App- More cars- Drift Spec- More organized rims- rim colors- remove spoilers- tire profiles and ride height- Specs for ALL cars			"

												I give the Crew 2 thumbs up. I'm not a critic, so I'm not going to pick apart the gameplay. It's fun. It drives well. I was a huge fan of Test Drive Unlimited 2, and this game has a very similar feel, with several improvements. If you dig open world driving and challenging arcade racing, pick this one up definitely. (Also of note, I have NOT experienced any network issues. No lag or connection issues)			"

												Just finished the single-player campaign, or whatever you wanna call the story missions, cause you can do them in co-op as well. Anyway, the game is not finished, yet enjoyable for a very specific crowd. Let me explain. At a very technical level, the game is not where it should be. Laggy and stuttery even on an FX-9590 and 290x, tendency to cook a water cooled processor that doesn't go past 58 in Prime95, and almost unplayable on a mobile platform with an A10-5750M and M290x. If you can muster better specs and get it to be playable and responsive, you'll run into their side of the hardware issues, meaning the server. It might not pe hardware though, but still technical. On some networks it works, on others it doesn't, and it will disconnect every now and then in the middle of one of those hour long races, and you'll have to do it all over again. So, if these are things that you think you can look past just to get a glimpse of the sunset from the Grand Canyon behind the wheel of a LaFerrari, this is the game for you. It looks amazing, the cars sound fantastic, and on hardcore driving mode the driving model is brilliantly tuned for a very good mix of arcade and sort of simulator. Not a simulator in the actual sense, just that it follows a few rules that arcade racers usually don't. Say you're in a controlled power slide, or a drift, and one of your back wheels hits the dirt on the outside of the bend, or the snow, or even a wet patch, you will lose control of the car, because the back end loses grip completely. That is a very nice touch. So, driving model not bad at all, but not a full on simulator by any means. The story itself is a cliche, obviously, you've heard it a million times if you're into this culture, or have ever played a NFS game or seen an FnF movie. Bad guy kills/betrays your brother/mother/sister/any other signifcant family members and then you seek to get revenge by driving fast and breaking the law almost all the way. Nevertheless, this story is told well, with good quality cut-scenes and voice acting. Also, the missions themselves are quite fun, at least at first, because later on the same challanges are presented for the lack of more then 3 or 4 modes. You get the normal checkpoint race, checkpoint time trial, a sort of destruction derby against the clock, where you need to catch and bash into the opponent several times until a health bar hovering over his/her car is depleted. This one is quite interesting and fun, until they pit you against a prison bus that can keep up with a modified Mustang that can do 300 KM/h. Funny, but frustrating after the fifth try. Also has the health or relisience of a prison bus. There's another mode which I shall call ""touch the package"" because it can be interpreted in several ways, and I love a good internal debate. Anyway, this one puts you on a course, against the time, in which there are 100 packages on the ground, the story will explain why they are there, don't worry, not as stupid as it sounds. You have to, within that time limit, hit 80 of those boxes. Sounds easy? Pah. Difficult, but fun.As a whole experience, because there is much more to talk about, and I can't be bothered because it's my night off, and I just wanted to share my general opinion about The Crew, the game is enjoyable if you like cars and the whole customization, FnF and NFSU heritage stuff. For the car enthusiast, the flaws are not there to disturb, we keep hoping that eventually they will be patched, because they are obvious, yet we look beyond them and enjoy good looking and sounding cars, that drive in an impressively fun and engaging manner, amongst scenery that you will probably only get to see in game. By the way, the map is a smaller version of the United States, with little versions of New York, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and many other major US cities. Basically, you get to drive across America. And, also important, in my opinion, you can modify your cars in pretty fine detail, and the body parts available are very good looking, and have that racy feel, not the silly Underground toy looking things. You can put together a very good looking off-road version of a 2011 Mustang with 800 horses under the hood. Pretty cool. Thumbs up, but please work on those performance issues at least. Thank you.

												This game is fun and realistic in some ways than others. The inside view from your car is a nice touch that won me over. They should think about adding more muscle cars, i.e., the 1970 Chevy El Camino and the 1979 Chevy Camaro Z28 to name a few. Some of the missions were tough to beat.

												PERSONAL OPINION Well, I'm going to tell you that this game needs a friend. Unfortunately, it doesn't come with one guaranteed.When I played this game/ both alone and with a friend, it is the absolute best racing/driving game I have ever played.No, I don't understand why there's so much hate. What do all those haters play, Need for Speed Rivals?All jokes aside; this game is definitely better than its competitors at its gen. I enjoyed this game thoroughly, and would rate it 98/100 (1 point minus for minor connectivity issues, 1 point minus for bad ending) Let me start with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map. Yes, the freaking huge map. And its not just 90% emptiness, no no no no....Its probably one of the largest maps in gaming history. I'm pretty sure it could go par against Guild Wars 2 in map size.Next up is the main story sequence. Overall, the story was NeedForSpeedMostWanted(2005)-ish and really pushes you to want to know more. Its not shakespeare but hey, I found it to fit okay.The cars in the game are well modeled (except their bottom; but who the hell looks there), and there is a pretty good level of car-modding. Okay, not Need For Speed Carbon/UG2 level, but at least around NFSMostWanted(2005) level. The paints choices are great, and the vinyl choices are not bad. They should make more though.I don't think there is alot of cars in the game, and before people start chirping the game because you can purchase cars; you can finish the game and get the best car without paying a single extra dollar. Just don't pay heed to purchasable cars and you're good. I personally liked their car choices; despite the low car count.The AI in the game (which some saw glitching) was actually flawless for me. They are pretty smart, and I'm pretty sure they are much better AI than that of older racing games. This is because the AI will not let you grind onto them or use them as ""padding"" as you make a sharp turn with them. They will speed up or slow down to make you screw up. It makes the game have a level of challenging in it.Okay, you got me here. The handling. Its not great is it? Well, I'm going to tell you that to each his own because me and my friend both just got used to it. I know, its kinda annoying, but it makes it a tad bit more challenging. It kinda forces you to learn how to properly turn and drift. Not sure if its realistic, but that doesn't matter for me anyway, it wasn't the end of the game. The graphics. This stuff is not your Driveclub or Forza graphics. But its definitely the right gen. I can barely run it with my computer but it looks amazing. Although there are some blotchy textures in shady places, the surrounding game has some good texturing.The Audio is good, but could use a little bit more bass/could sound more heavy.All the different specs you can get for your car, these are what fill in the ""not enough customization"" and ""not enough cars"" gap. The specs and their upgrades are well done, and they give the cars more specialization in what they do.The performance parts in the game are acquired by the means of completing mini-challenges or buying them at high levels. Of course, I didn't mind this as much but I could see why people would prefer buying them. Plus the model of the vehicle's inside does not change, no matter which performance part you pick. I did not have this game crash too many times, only twice from my many hours of playing and also once because my Eyefinity is not really compatible. I didn't find any bugs so far (minus my friend apparently being able do drive underwater once). The PVP in this game was decent, and the MMO-thing is not the biggest thing about the game. I played with a friend; as I said before, and we both really enjoyed this game.The challenges are a bit silly, but they are great in the case that someone wants to get some quick cash. The game's economy isn't that bad. Worth every dime of my 40$. TLDR; 98/100, huge map, get a friend, ending sucks, but overall an enjoyable game.			"

												I never write reviews, but I had to for this: This game is totally worth it.I've been waiting for an open world racer forever and the scale of this is incredible. The biggest hesitation I had was graphics. I'm on a gtx 960, I'm used to playing max quality games whether it's Assassins Creed or Starcraft or Guild Wars 2. The reality is, I'm used to good graphics, and I can't play anything that looks terrible.This game, with gtx 960 I can easily crank up to maximum, and my God it looks beautiful. I mean, I guess it was the expectation that it might be crap, thanks to all those negative reviews and the only videos that portray PS/Xbox gameplay. But on PC, with max settings, it's a modern game. And that's critical because I want to tour the country!Now gameplay wise, I just started, so I can't tell you yet. But even if it literally had 0 story, 0 missions, no campaign, I'm satisfied. And I can't wait to spend hours just driving around the country and check out all those cities I've visited before and explore all the new cities that I've never seen. Screw the AI, screw the online gameplay. You want those? There's already plenty of games before The Crew that deliver on that. You're here because this is literally the craziest open world driver there is.Thanks Ubisoft. And to those hesitators out there, I deliberated since its release, and now I've picked it up and totally worth it.			"

												I bought this game when it was still brand new for 60 dollars. It was definitely not worth that much. If you find it on sale and are considering buying it make sure you're not going to buy it for the multiplayer because it's dead. Everytime I tried to go online with it I was never able to get into a lobby with a good amount of players. I had a lot of hope for this game because of how large the map is but when I started playing it I realized that the map is not even close to being realistic. The storyline is alright but not perfect. If you find it cheap I would recommend you try it out because I did love the car customization and how much detail they put into that part of the game. Overall Score 6/10.			"

												I'll be honest: I was hyped as hell when i first saw the trailer.But I waited it to go on sale, and downloaded the trial version first. I was scared by the huge amount of negative reviews.I bought the standard version, no DLC, no Season Pass, they will come later, maybe, we'll see.The Season Pass is tempting me, but 24€ is just a little too much. I'll wait a sale.The driving feel and physics: doesn't feel totally right, I've had better, but it's not so awful as many had depict. Maybe it's just my steering settings, need to look into it some more.Rubberbanding AI: not found. Both when I got the lead and when I was behind, I felt no rubberbanding from the AI cars. Drive clean, with no mistakes, and who's behind will stay behind.Little update: the rubberbanding is noticeable in long races (>30 min), otherwise is pretty much nonexistant.It is not a simulator, at all.Later I'll add some more details, I need to go deeper in the game experience. Until then, it's a 7/10.Get it when on sale (30-50%).EDIT, 1/8: Damn me I bought the SP. Worth. Cars are really well made, only thing that bothers me are mirrors not working. In 2015. Come on Ivory Tower, you can do better than this. Still a 7/10 and still worth, even more if you have 2-3 friends to race with.PvPs are demolition derbies, never seen such unsportsmanship.Fun thing to do is dodge the oncoming opponent, watch the wannabe rear-ender fly down a cliff and taste his salty tears as he insults you in french.EDIT, 21/8/16: More than one year is passed and I STILL CAN'T GET ENOUGH of this game!However, some things really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off:- Wild Run and the incoming Calling All Units are not included in the Season Pass. Need more money, Ubi?- ""Smart Loot"" my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Getting end-tier car parts is now an almost impossible task with all the useless vinyl/paint/rims drops. Either farm money and buy the parts from the tuner shop or get ready for some serious grinding.- Wild Run adds pretty much nothing compared to its price. No story, no challenges, no trials, nothing. Also, bikes behave like cars and your monster truck behaves like a normal car (don't expect to ramp through traffic Monster Jam style).- Car physics are a little too much uniform. Raid cars, for example: a 1750kg Dodge RAM jumps and swerves like a 950kg Porsche. Not good.- WE (at least I, for what is worth) NEED SOME BASIC CAR SETTINGS. High-end gearbox parts have ratios too low, the car in 5th gear does not pull without NO2. Only way to tune gear ratios is to install lower tier parts. ABSOLUTELY not good.- Still can't use custom music in the in-game radio. Seriously? Come on.The vote is still a 7/10, get it if you like roam around with some music (played in VLC), don't get Wild Run.Also, people complaining about game not working with Nvidia drivers or new GPUs: I have drivers version 372 with a GTX1070. Everything works flawlessy. Get your PC right before downvoting a game.			"

												The game is still rough around the edges, but at this moment, there is no other Arcade Racing game that is more towards the Need For Speed series rather than the Burnout one. Customization is just enough for each car, the vynils are lacking, but good none the less. The game is updated frequently enough, economy has been fixed, physics are still a tad wonky but the AI and Controls have been improved.All in all, a decent enough racing game...until the new Need For Speed comes out.

												Updated: This is my final review. All of my review on thia game are base on gameplay and its features except story plot, as I always skip them like I do in other race game (except Split Second <3 ). If you have experience in Need For Speed Underground 2/Most Wanted (old), then you might have a same experience in The Crew, with different styles of course. Graphic is ok actually, and the control or handling car aren't that bad. So far it is good, it's cool to see other players during roam mode. Basicly the PvP (non crew pvp) is just same like other race game such Dirt 2, however, instead require host create a a lobby and organize the event, The Crew players that joined the lobby will vote which event they want to try. Haven't try yet the Crew vs Crew PvP (aka team vs team). Event after try I wont update anymore. xPDo caution that server in co-op/PvP is really terrible, most of time you'll get disconnected issue, not sure is this is really base on player's internet connection or it's the game's server issue..There's no rubberband Ai like those negative said, it's just normal Ai like other racing game. There's no perfect and logic Ai. It's yours skills to how you deal with them. Here's my screenshot.

Here's about Ai info I've been meet:Racer: •Like other game they sometimes can bit speedy or slow, even they speed is same as your. But as I said before, it's about your skills. For me, most Ai racer are very easy to handle. •Most of them stick into they waypoint, lika a train rail. There's a mission that I saw the same car hit on a truck twice (I retry the mission and yea, it occur on same place, same time). But meh, I play other race game before so its just normal.•A Take Down mission really annoying. Dunno how to explain lol.Cops, Police:•All right.. So far I only see two way to trigger chase. 1st, hit anything inside 'Police Watch' area, until they trigger chase. 2nd way is, hit the police car if you see them. If you guys know other way (than mission), please let me know coz its fun trolling them xP•All police just do is only ramming you. The star wanted level seems only increase number of police chasing you, road block and heli. Seriously roadblock is pretty ridiculous, only 1 police car block, with signal obstacles, in any wanted level. Please do not run from them by trying taking offroad, they'll chase you with dirt specs, also with heli, which is really difficult to escape if your car were using non raid/dirt spec. It was hell for me to run from them using Golf inaide forest but it was fun. xDNote: For those people who is don't have a clue about trial issue, copy your CD key in Steam Library and paste it at Active Product on uPlay.Please also do note that the trailer is too promising. I suggest you to try demo 1st. Well, it's still fun and cool racing game I ever played, 2nd of my fav after Split Second.Here's my review so far:-Pros:Big detailed mapAble to see other players roaming around. It's cool!Nice graphicSomewhat it's challenging. Seriously, sometimes there's too many cars (obstacles) on trafficNo cut-scene crash/accident like Need For Speed series (if you think this is cons it is pro for me. I hate when speeding in race or in free roaming, or while eescaping from police you got crash and then a cut-screen, slowing down you).Support are nice, I guess.Most time updateGreat communityCrew vs Crew PvP systemGreat car customization. You can tune your car to into various specs which is street, dirt (rally actually..), raid, circuit. You can't tune Stock specs but you can customize its visual on your HQ.8 players on each roam map is great, I guess.. Assuming enable more players will make the map lag, like most online game I played. Even though the map is very super large scaled getting lag will make player frustrated and stop play. This is my experienced in most online game. At least for me.Cons:Crew Credits systems in-game, in PAID games. Some car cannot bought through bucks. This should not happen. (Note: ingame progress you'll receive free 100k crew credit once. But as I said, Crew Credit supposedly not exist since this paid game, also can make game unbalanced.Season Pass benefit kinda unfair for me. Plus it is expensive, not worth for its features. DLC also expensive.Kinda unrealistic physics.Must have internet connection to play.Ingame player's profile avatar are using uPlay avatar, and can't upload/customize ingame profile avatar like the trailer.. This is so frustrating, stupid, and horrible..Thats all from me. :)My rate: 8/10			"

												Amazing game. My opinion is that is one of the world's most underrated games ever. It runs great, the cars look great. If you think the steering is too slow just adjust your sensitivity. I've travelled a lot, bought a lot of cars and now bikes. It is awesome to buy the Wild Run DLC. It is worth every penny, I simply love the game. The pvp events are nice, and the map is just amazingly huge. LOVE IT!			"

												I bought this during the Steam Christmas sale (2016). I got The Crew and the Crew Wild Run for about $20.  WELL WORTH IT. NOTE: Activate your CD KEy within Uplay, otherwise, you will be stuck on The Crew Wild Run beta. Pretty stupid, I know, but it took me a little while to figure that out since its not an official steam game. You can get a great deal on this game for the content you receive if you wait for it on sale.The driving style is more arcade-ish,  kind of like the Burnout series. Downsides:    You receive the occasional framerate drop from 60 to about 50 in bigger cities such as Los Angeles due to the higher volume of traffic.     The story is good, but the story missions are kind of repetitive. Hopefully, they can mix it up a little more in the sequel (if they decide to make one).			"

												I've played this game for 3 hours total, i cannot say i have anything to complain about in the way the map system and cars look and so forth. But anyway, pro's and con's.Con's:- controlling of cars aren't as good as i expected when i bought the game. - At points, not occuring too often, the game freezez like a glitch or loads forever which ends up in me restarting the game. - Too good graphics, (shouldn't complain, but not having a high end pc is taking it's toll on me, and in the position i am in right now, i can't upgrade my pc. Therefore i wish the game had more ""modifiable"" graphics where i can choose what the graphics card focuses mostly on. Such as for example, car quality over cloud/sunray quality (For example).- I do feel like it's not a super great racing game, where as i got my hopes up while watching trailers and such. Pro's:-Game looks amazing-Great details on car, great details on to be honest, anything graphic wise. - Very ""rookie"" friendly, i believe anyone could enjoy this gameIn general, i do very much recommend this game if they fix the cars driving and drifting control. (More like GTA V) If you got a high-end pc, and you enjoy games with amazing graphics, this is definitely to recommend! :) Based on skills with driving games and such:  Experience Recommended?   Noob Sure, try the Demo   Experienced Yep, try the version without DLC's and such   Pro Yes definitely, just buy the whole kit, won't regret it.  "

												Reviewing / Comparing with Need For Speed 2015Crew Vs NFS 20151) Story mode - NFS 2015 has a disappointing story mode which basically is not a story mode its just (Just cutscenes) and they are like hey come on over so we can race with this dude and i am doing a night out in racing, You get cutscene or phone calls which is frustrating as they call you duing a race and they tell  you tht i am here waiting come-on and dont leave me hanging even when u are playing in co-op. Crew  has a nice story mode which is good and a plus point you can play some of the missions again if u want in co-op or Solo Crew Story Mode - 8/10   /////     Nfs 2015 - 3/102) Graphics - Need For Speed uses the frostbite engine same as BF4 which makes the game look good but its only night and always rainy. But the Graphics look Awesome Crew uses the new Anvil+ engine which is used in AC unity and AC syndicate + all their game which is also good and it has a 24hr cycle before the wild run update it used Babel EngineCrew Graphics - 8/10  /////   NFS Graphics - 9/103) Internet Usage - Both of the games are Online but Crew stands out bcoz of its Least usage of internet when u are alone , Crew uses a 8mil radius to match you with other players so if no 1 is in tht 8mil radius then u only communicate with the server on short intervals on the other hand NFS 2015 needs a Constant Internet connection even in Play Alone mode my routers lights didnt stop, They just kept going so its a constant communication of Send and Receive which is not Good if u are on a Data Cap.Crew - 9/10   /////  NFS 2015 - 5/104) Races in openworld - Races in Crew are good as u can play them in PVP or Solo mode but it loads you in the match means u wont bump into other players unless u are doing Skill challenges , In Nfs even if u play solo or in a crew u will bump into players or npc's which are not in your race which ruins the whole race exp. NFS 2015 - 3/10  ///// Crew - 9/105) Customization Paint and Parts and Car -Some Customization in NFS is good like Paint Jobs (Wraps) which you can customize according to your style just like NFS shift while in Crew u cant put any paint skins on some cars. Parts some cars cant be modified in NFS,  while some parts are missin in Crew but still they can be modified.Crew Cars = 66 cars + 7 bikes (BIkes is a plus point in Crew)Nfs Cars = 49 + 2 hot rods (no bikes)Crew - 9/10 ///// NFS - 5/106) Open World -Crew it stretched from US EAST. to US WEST whole USA basically.NFS a place called portview? which is some highside roads and some city and 2-3 bridges.Final Verdict - Go for The Crew You will love the game more content to enjoy than NFS , But if u want to buy NFS go for when on heavy Sale like 50-75% off otherwise is a NO GO.So final socre The Crew =8/10 and NFS 2015 =5/10			"

												I really like this game!After switching to Windows 10 and a new computer my previous addiction, TDU2, stopped working. I was in need for something new and picked up the crew on sale. I have been playing the game on a daily basis and I really like it.The good:- Graphics & framerate - runs smooth on ultra on my machine- big playfield to explore, cities are very nicely done- Controls (I use an Xbox 360 controller) work well- Cars feel different between the classesThe not so good- The story feels like an aftertought- The wild run commercials are annoying (although i intend to pickup the DLC if it is on sale)- I have some connectivity issues when playing PVP- I have uplay issues, something it hangs on 'syncronising trophies' and only a reboot solves that- life stops at level 50I would recommend the game to anyone interested in casual racers			"

The graphics are good for what it is, a massive open world online game. Don't expect an mmo to have perfect AAA graphics.			"

Posted: September 16, 2016
												So I bought this game day 1, when it came out on 360, and too be honest, it was dissappoining then. However, since then this game has become much better. There are still a few things that need to be addressed. Until the Cops vs Racers update, I'd give it a 7/10. Once the new update is here, depending on what gets fixed, it might go up.1) Open world. And I mean OPEN WORLD. The map is immense, go any where you want to go. It literally takes almost an hour to drive at 150mph to get from NY to LA, and that's if you don't get distracted by something shiny. 2)Envornment. Might not make a difference in how your vehicle handles. However the change from forest to snowy mountains to desert adds life to the game. the addition of wildlife also adds a nice touch. challenging when your going 180mph in a McLaren and then DEER!!!!3)AI. Ubisoft still has some work to do on this one. However, compared to what it was at the beginning, massivly better. The cities actually feel like their alive to a point. Its also neat when your in the countryside, theres no where near as much traffic as in the city.4)DLC. I know most people don't like paying for extra game. However, the DLCs have brought much needed content to the game, and has greatly added to the depth of the game.5)Graphics. They are just fantastic to look at, and i have a $50 low resolution TV, so imagine if a High-def TV is used. I can see the individual drops of rain on the windshield.6)The cars. What car game can be complete  without the cars. I still felt that there were too few cars, maybe about 35 total with the DLC. They have been adding new cars for free however, so there's still hope for this one.7)Cops. Ok so this is probably my biggest irritant. The cops are well, easy to beat. They don't really present a challange. However, they do set up roadblocks, PIT you, and they have even down the rolling box on me. However it is so easy to get away. On this one, Im waiting too see what happens with the new cops vs racers uodate in November. 8) Physics. Kindy goofy. For those looking for a simulator level of driving, go look elsewhere. Its got a arcady feel to it, which for me its fine. If I wanted simulater I'd go play Forza.9)Always online. With good internet connection, you can still play and not deal with anyone else. They'll still be there, but it doesn't force you to interact with them. However it would be nice too have a offline option. Eventually Ubisoft will have to add it in. They cant keep the servers up forever.10)Story. Really short. Feels kind of forced at times, and makes you go ""wha"" at times. But i didnt get tis game to watch cutscenes, i got it to take a sportscar off roading and launching it off cliffs, because why the F--- not.Overall, I give this game 7/10. It is fun racing game that can make hours dissappear. Id wait til its on sale to get it. Get the one woth all the packs. It'll make the game that much better too play.			"

												Love it, the game is so much of what we all hoped for from NFS and TDU series. What they were supposed to be and then some.  I have longed for a MMO Racing game that was just that.  A ""MMO"" racing game... Since the days of MCO, we finally have one.  I just really hope the MS doesn't kill it, turn it into P2W, and that the prices are REASONABLE!!!  Now if they would just add a few more trucks and (before the tuner haters start ranting) that they add Scion.  Look'em up, they are winning like mad!  (and hey, the tC and FRS are good lookin! don't deny it you muscle car lovers =P )  But really though, go check out the vids on youtube!   So looking forward to the game expanding, so much potential with such a great idea!(aside from the normal dose of haxlet nubtart basement dwelling trolls, the ones on here don't seem to grasp the concept of ""crews"" nor factions in this game.)I did the closed beta and even at that time with bugs and adjustments needed in phsyics/mechanics it was a blast to play.  The cars look great, although the car audio could use some attention to make them sound more like the real deals IMO.  Have any questions, feel free to ask!Also IMO, the gold will be worth it.  Look forward to hating some tires on Dec. 2nd!Well now after launch I still don't change my opinion!  I have noticed a bit more lag than beta and had a crash.  In beta I had less lag and no crashes lol.   If you didn't get the pre-order you missed out on some cool content.  Any questions as I said before; Feel free to askLag has lessend quite a bit and still waiting on the patches.  They are starting to make a habbit of not really supporting the games after release.  Still though I do reccomend the game, just wait for a sale.  If they fixed the sync issues and a few other bugs that can hinder game play a bit, it would be well worth the full price.Well after playing and waiting, it is about half of what they promised.  Not suprised as Ubisoft is making a habbit and trend of this crap.  With the issues of being able to see other players and ""co-op""  still giving a problem, with NAT issues.  It can be fun when you can actually play with others and find people that actually have a clue as to what The Crew is supposed to be.  Still say it's not worth full price, but it is free to play monthly, So... If you are still on the fence, I suggest wathcing some streams or Youtube vids.			"

												Okay here I am, two years after the game got released. And having bought the Gold edition, and now CAU with WR it wasn't the cheapest thing here. Hell I might have bough a ship in Star Citizen instead of this. But this game has given me Many hours of relaxation. If we are talking about PVP even some frustration. If you want an open world racing game, get this, but I'd wait for a sale, since it's crazy buying it for the full price with the DLC's, it's important to say that you are good to go with the standard version, altough CAU brings some sweet Police vehicles.But hey first I'll tell you what you will completely love about this game.The world, it's just so huge that I can't stop loving it. I always wanted a racing game where instead of just running around tracks, you could just set a course and go that way. And these guys finally did it. I've driven aimlessly for about 500km's (real). And then another 500 km's with set destinations (without any purpose)And another 300km's when I had to get somewhere.So that's the open world done.Racing SP - AI is weird and stupid. But it can be quite enjoyable to try and stay in the perfect line on the current track. Singleplayer racing is more used for grinding money.Racing MP - I don't like it. It's just exploiting the games arcade drive model. So instead of real driving action you are just sliding and doing unrealistic stuff all the time.The Summit - You do some stuff from time to time to increase your chance to get a vehicle for free, nothing extra.CAU pursuits - Feel extremely weird... You have two abilities, as racer and even as a cop. They slightly are slightly different from each other, but extremely OP. Just press one button each 40s to literally stop each and everys cop atempt to stop you, cop players end up just resetting to the transporter to get emp'ed again... Cops are in a huge disadvantage, if you are Dark Souls kind of player who just wants to die of frustration, suit yourself. For Racers it's a grinding quest, where occasionally you get intercepted by a cop player, and just follow two simple rules 1) head for the destination 2) Press any of your abilities when ready and cop players are nearby to ruin their day and secure yourself that you get the money to buy another car to do the same thing again to buy another car and so on.Vehicles - Another thing that I love about this game is the amount of cars. They might not represent their real life counterparts. But hey, they are not completely same cars. You get European supercars, classics, sportscars, American Muscle cars and Japanese tuners. If you have a favorite car, it is probably there.Customization is also fine, most of the time you get about 8 bumper variations, hoods. Wings, rims. Hell of a lot of colors and stickers. To make your favorite car appeal to you even more.Also I really love the added police vehicles. Nothing says security more then a cop driving 360km/h in a police Lamborghini Gallardo SVVerdict - This game is just great for wandering off just like you do for instance in Skyrim.Unfortunately you can see throughout the game that the energy to develop this game went into the wrong aspects. I personally think that Ivory Tower should've gone into the RP style of gameplay, similar to Test Drive Unlimited. They focus too much on ""your"" Crew, that is just a normal group like in WoW or any other MMORPG.But if it is in sale, and you crave for a driving game with vast open world and a variety of vehicles. I say go for it.			"

												-Short and Sweet-If you know what your buying, did your research and understand its an MMO-R-RPG, with future free updates and DLC, Know what it is: Arcade-ish, Horizontal progression, minor vertical progression, open-world. Know what it is not: Not realistic racer, no massive important story, a game thats been out for a long time. Side notes: the BS thats being said about fixing up your cars, complete BS, Every spec, every car has its own style and body parts, i havent seen a clone of my skyline yet. Also iv been helped out by lvl 50's many times, just my Quick Cooping, iv made friends and raced on open streets for no good reason. Story missions done with rando's then friend requested. The car parts are like MMO's loot systems, you gotta complete something to get the upgrade part.Theres a lot of BS comments revolving around this game.The game is what you make it. Thats why its called Open-World. Also if you notice, some of the reviewers that talked♥♥♥♥♥♥on the game, still play it, GG.			"

												ok first off i am a die hard need for speed fan i loved the most wanted remake so was looking for something to fill the void, this game wont feel like need for speed the race mechianics are a bit more buttery and understeering the controls make it worse also you cant win a race with just motor power your going to need your boost as often as you can but what this game lacks in driving experince it more then makes up for in detail OMG i love how detail customization is in this game!!!!!!! i loved making tuned out ricers in need for speed. the game has the room to drive around streach your legs kinda space is amazing the diversity between citys is such a WIN honestly all this game needs is an easy drive menu and more traction on the tires and its gold personaly i love this the off road and different spec setups for all the cars is perfection so if you like to throw your car around and like to personalize your rides this game is for you just beware theres missions where you wont use your car so dont get too attached at the beginning.

												So last year after playing for 80 hours I gave this game a bad review. I said easy fix, let us make a race and do our own checkpoints. Then i forgot about this game and a friend of mine gave me the DLC as a gift, and behold, exactly what I suggested happened. I put about another 40 hours into it already with my friends trying to increase our ranking in the wild run. The only thing i don't like about this game is what they call SMART LOOT. You pretty much are forced into getting gold  just to get an upgrade to your car that only adds a point or 2 to the specs when you can get platinum which should be a better part. Sometimes smart loot gives you a part, but mostly a new color paint job that if i wanted I would buy. But with limited tuning that seems to not matter in the end with a mini cooper with the same specs as a hyper car. It wouldve been fine to cap off lower end cars, it would have made the game more fun to get faster cars and actually made the season pass worth it. 7/10 with friends 5/10 solo			"

If i had to do that with any need fo speed game and counting how many times ive replay`d those games i would have paid thousands. If ubisoft gives us this option i would  give 10/10 but 5/10 as its an impoant feature to all games otherwise many great games would be long forgotten.			"

Posted: February 14, 2015
												Ubisoft has created a new genre of racing game, it's neither arcade or realism, it's Ubisoft genre which is really, really bad.This game is one of the worse racing games I've ever played.The cops are like walls of brick.I finished a quick activity where i needed to drive through the arrows and a cop was after me, it shouldn't since i was in an activity but oh well i end up the activity and now i can't to anything cause a window appear to show me my score and right after i was gonna click on something so I could retry it I got bursted... What the heck is that?There are many flaws other than that but In my opinion, that is the worse of them.It is an MMO but why is the connection always required? That's ********, In 1, 2 or 3 years, when the servers will close, what we'll do? Lost 100$ for a game that is not even worth 2$ that we won't even be able to play anymore?I'm not pre-purchasing games from Ubisoft anymore, I got my lesson, thanks Ubisoft and congratulations.Seriously, If I could get a refund I would ask for a refund right now.Now I'm stuck with an horrible game to finish.I thought that this game would be so great, I'm really disappointed to be honest.It could have been a really great game.2/10 (I can't give it more than 2, I'm not even sure if it does deserve 2 to be honest).The 6/10 review is way too good, a 6/10 game is a under-average game and this game is far but really far away from that.Facts are facts.This game is crap, it's not a simulation, do not believe those idiotic morons who says that this game feels like a simulation one, it's pure arcade, the problem is not that this is an arcade game, the problem is a that it is a really, but really bad arcade game.It feels like a Pay2Win game (or spend a lot, but a lot of time grinding for crap) that I have paid 110$ for.Of course I'm done pre-purchasing games, from any developers, developers and publishers are cancer nowadays, the only game I am glad I pre-purchased even If i didn't not play it alot back then, was the Witcher 3 because it has content, the price was okay and it doesn't have crappy greedy ""we're too incompetent and brainless, we need your money, feed us with your money, we're w**res"" microtransactions.People who pre-purchased the game (such as me, not pre-ordering any Ubisoft or EA Games never again, never did with Activision, Treyarch and Infinity Ward) paid 110$ for this piece of trash that required you to be online 24/7 if you want to play, the season pass is not worth **** and the game is made by a bunch of pathetic incompetents, we barely got any content and we have to pay for crappy ""expansions"" that should be in the season pass since we got barely anything off it.We paid 40$+ for a few cars... Okay? And we have to pay for the crappy expansions wannabe that should have been in the season pass in the first place?Damn it Ubisoft, you're worse than I thought, you have no limit to your dumbness, pathetic greedness, you are easily in the top of the worse developers ever, probably worse kind of human too? You don't kill innocent people, that's it, at least, that's a start but you ♥♥♥♥ them up with such bullcrap. And you except us to buy more of your games?Right, even some brainless dudes can dream I guess.Like always, they're lying, they says that there's more than 100 cars on this game but there is NOT, it's just different variations (dirt, street, raid, etc). You can't say that there's more than 100 vehicles, that's just bu**sh** and you know it, one lie after another, Ubisoft are the best at it.The driving is horrible, the handling is horrible.The physics are simply horrible, the physics were better in many 2000 racing games than in this one for fu**'s sake.Microtransactions on a 110$ game.The cops catch you way too fast (you stop for a second and you are already under arrested, that is not realistic at all).After finishing a challenge, It brings a screen with your score and stuff but if you have cops after you then you'll get arrested and you can not do anything about it.They sell DLCs that should come free with the game, let's be honest, anyone with gray matter and who know how a computer works can make meshes and textures, animations are more complicated but if you spend the time learning, you'll be able to do something way better than what those morons at Ubisoft did.There's not many vehicles and they all feel the same but with different speed.Microtransactions on a 110$ game.Now they sell an expansion that people who bought the season pass should have for free.I could say a lot more but I'll stop here, well done Ubisoft, well done, you are seriously pathetic and your name is the definition of ""greed"" and ""incompetent"".Wait, did I said that this game has mother♥♥♥♥ing transactions? Because there is.In my case, he only reason to keep playing this game, It's because I paid 110$ for this crap so better make it worth it even if the game is in all honesty, sh**.And it will probably be too late in a few years when they will close the servers, will they add a offline mode? Seriously, I doubt it, we're talking about Ubisoft after all, a bunch of brainless, worse than headless chickens, ****oles.I'm always straight when it comes to facts.Save yourself some money and do not buy this game, they're probably going to close the servers way before 2018 and they probably won't even add an offline mode, if they do, then I'll be impressed and they'll deserve an award for being somehow competent.This game should be free to play, seriously, just stay away from it.The question would be... Which one is the worse? EA Games, Ubisoft or Activision/Treyarch/Infinity Ward?This question is giving me a headache...And now most of the developers follows them.Where is all of this going? I love video games, I really do but it should just stop, no more producing, or at least, not from incompetents such as those, it should be illegal for them to make any games.Sorry not sorry if you love Ubisoft, it's all about the facts, I don't know how you can like them after all what they've done, perhaps 19 years ago, when they started but not today, they're just bad.Are there even bots in this game? That roams freely like in Test Drive? All I see is humans, sometimes, there are like two players, no bots.I don't know if this game has bots or not but it doesn't seems like it, which would be pretty stupid since a way older game has them and they were pretty good, sometimes, you thought they were humans.Seriously, just go play Test Drive Unlimited, it's a way better game, it may have a few flaws and not the best handling ever but does this game even has a good handling? Not at all, not even average.Heck, even Test Drive Unlimited 2 is better than this.I'll be waiting for my offline mode with bots, If i don't get them, you can be sure I won't be buying any of your games ever again Ubishit.

												This game was quite a letdown, to be honest.The physics are awful, every car handles like it is front-wheel-drive, any collision will send you into either a cutscene, or will shove you into oblivion, Traffic will spawn randomly causing more collisions and annoying cutscenes,The story is flimsy at best,Objectives are repetitive,Map is large, but sparsely populated with cities, and the cities that do exist in game are much smaller than they should be.Police chases lack any real substance (all they do is follow)Lack of carsLack of customizationThe customization that the game does include feels like it came straight out of F&F The Crew almost feels like it should have been released about 10 years ago with NFS: Most Wanted, because that is exactly what this game reminds me of.

												With this new update, ♥♥♥♥ man you guys have to fix a LOT, seriously.- The race guilde line. ( the ones that tells you where to go and when to hit the brakes or gas ) is completely broken, it was never that fantastic, but it was playable, but now it constantly tells you you're off track or the line just completely dissappears. example: I was just playing a faction race in the south, one of more than 1 hour long ( according to the game... ) and after every check point the line dissappears after about half a mile after you hit the checkpoint, you're better off without than with the raceline.- Setback to track. djeezes, that one is one of the worst things there is to complain about rn. IT BLOODY SET'S YOU BACK TO THE PREVIOUS CHECKPOINT INSTEAD OF JUST BACK ON THE TRACK. During my faction race in the south there I had lead of more than 1 minute, they were more than 4 or 5 miles behind me, I crash into another car, I get reset, ♥♥♥♥ING HALF A MILE BEHIND THE CARS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY 5 MILES BEHIND ME. and it didn't happend just once, happend multiple times. and now that I'm writing about setbacks, if you go off track for too long with a street, dirt, perf or circuit car and you wanna get a setback it sets you in the middle of where the ♥♥♥♥ you are, everywhere but on the road.- Guardrails. whenever you're going with a decent speed over the highway ( or any road ) and you end up sliding along a guardrail if you don't watch out it'll stop you at an instant. flip your car to the other side of a road or just crash your car completely. seriously? I lost soo many times because of this glitch. along with all the other ♥♥♥♥ed up stuff, look into it and fix it.I used to enjoy this game a LOT, played over 200 hours on it because I really did like this game, but not anymore, with the new update that went live couple of hours ago, there is soo much to fix, seriously. I like this update with the cop cars and stuff, but instead of being greedy to money and making a new dlc, focus more on glitches and bugs in the game. I do know you probably have a team working on that, but put more people on that team because with this update, you have a LOOOOT or work to do.			"

The Crew ReviewWARNING: My opinions are just opinions, nothing more. Do not just buy this game because I said so, look at it overall and ask yourself if you want it.Side Note A lot of people are saying that they keep getting disconnected from Ubisoft servers because of Ubisoft. They are lying. Ubisoft have fixed most, if not all connection bugs on their side. It is just their internet, if you have a solid internet connection, you will be able to play with hardly any interruptions at all.SummaryThe Crew is an open world MMO for racing. Sounds familiar, no? If you liked Test Drive Unlimited, you will most hopefully like this. It has a variety of cars, and what with a few DLC's and the new expansion pack 'Wild Run' coming out (more on that later) soon enough, this game will have you playing for quite a few hours either racing through the story, or taking a leisurely cruise through the Mountain States.Features- 30+ cars- 5 regions: each different from one another.- 5 different specifications: Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid, Circuit, 3 to be added: Drift, Monster and Dragster.- Short story, so you can get down to the pure racing and cruising- 8 player sessions, 9/10 times you are paired with your friend's session.- Lots of ways to make money.- Game will look beautiful, thanks to the new overhaul made by the Wild Run (17 November)ConsSome parts of this game can be enough to put some people off. For example, if you're looking for a deep storyline, MASSIVE amounts of players to mess around with and races with great AI, this game is not for you. However, lets face it. 32 cars all driving around in the same vicinity would take a beating on your PC (unless you have around 2 grand to play with). Also, this game will force uPlay on you. Not necessarily bad, just thought I should point that out. (Some people HATE uPlay).TL:DRLong story short, don't let people tell you its bad and then never play it. That's what the demo is for. Play the demo, see if you like it, and if you do, then go ahead, buy it and have fun. Think of this game as a successor to Test Drive Unlimited. After all, it was designed by the same people.Rating9/10 ★★★★★★★★★			"

												Recommended for %75+ discount price, for its base price it absolutely does not worth it! ( i also bought it on sale that is why i gave it a ""recommended"" )This review is from someone who is not a racing or sports fan at all but my all time favourite racing game which actually got me into trying some racing games is Need for Speed Most Wanted 2005:The Crew is a bit close to NFSMW 2005 since it has a story line + car tuning + cop chases + helicopter supports and different type of racing methods such as circuit or just a straight racing line or just like NFS 2005 time trials in addition it also has ""Raid"" and ""Dirt"" racing too which completely makes it different than other racing games. story line is not that good or amazing it is just there to help you progress faster and unlock more stuff before you jump into multiplayer so do not expect an amazing ending or something totally unique.Pros:- a complete racing game for those who want to experience every type of racing methods in one game.- handling the car can be really realistic if you put it on hardcore, unlike NFS it is much harder to handle the car here it is more realistic.- perks which can help you to finish the game easier.- good online compared to other UBI games this one is one of the few games which has a good online, COOP is really nice if you are stuck in a mission just find someone to do COOP with it is alot easier to pass the campaign missions in the COOP than solo.- huge map and a lot of different areas to test your car in.- different tones of online game modes which can be selected by voting before the match starts.Cons:- if you have a wireless gamepad your game detects it as driving wheel and therfore keys dont work properly at all.- sometimes you need to restart the game completley to avoid some minor bugs such as not showing a friend online or in your crew when they join you.- for a $60 game there is too much cut out contents being sold as DLC, for example the biggest joke is all Mercedes cars in this game are DLC none of them can be unlocked without paying real money which is a shame for a $60 game.- some missions are extremly stupidly designed specially the raid ones. they have no racing feeling at all and in some of them yu have to drive in middle of trees at night so you crash a lot and it is really really annoying.- not all cars can be tuned to what you want, the tuning is just a side option in this game it is not actually tuning like in NFS 2005, you have nearly no options for tuning your car except accepting what game forces you to buy for the missions.- finding a multiplayer match is so hard, first you need to search automatically for a game and as long as not enough players are found the lobby wont get started, when it does players have to vote for what type of game mode and race they wanna play, you can not select what game mode you want before searching so you exactly get what you want. you select what you want in the lobby and so do other players so if you are lucky you get what you want if not then you have to play what others want.- you can not test your favourite car in every race you want as most of the cars do not have much tuning options for Raid and Dirt. for example if your car is aston martin you can only play it in ""performance missions"" if a mission is dirt or street you have to use a street car and aston martin can not be tuned for any other race than ""performance"".- for a 2014 game i was expecting a lot better graphics for this game but sadly only cars are really detailed and well designed people and the city enviroment have the graphics of GTA back in 2000s. Cutscenes are nearly like a movie they are really detailed well designed and really high quality but game its self is absolutly awful for a 2014 game.- cop chases are really really stupid and they can be EASILY avoided. road blocks are a joke only one car in the road block and helicopter always runs out of fuel so fast and returns to base so you are safe from air recon. your car is 1000x times faster than police cars they never reach you and you can clearly see this in every escape mission you can avoid them under 20 seconds and win the mission. i personally never got arrested in this game by cops but in NFS 2005 i think at least 30000 times i was being arrested by cops.- crashing physics is really stupid and unreleastic somtimes. you can avoid a hard crash and sometimes by even a small scratch your car gets messed up, it is really random.

												Overall a very good game, i have 6 hours in the beta and something like 12 in the real game so far..Though, in both the beta and the full release, I seem to see a lot less people than those in youtube videos i've watched..I'm not sure if it's just me but i also have yet to actually have a chat with anyone in game via the chat system, i type in freedrive, private message, and even the crew  that i was randomly invited to. My attempts to make contact with the few other players i've seen have seen me following them around spamming ""can you see this"" and ""flash your lights if you see this"". If anyone can help me with this or shed some light on whether or not it's supposed to be this way i'd be greatful.besides that rant,9/10 would recommend.			"

												Well this is the 2nd time i bought The Crew becuase EA delayed their NFS 2015 for PC, and i need to fullfill my Racing Game addiction so i bought this game again. Because this is the only decent Arcade Racer game yet on pc, and im sure when NFS out on PC it will knock the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game :DShort Review: Good Story and Large map to play with + BIKES!! , Lack of Cars + Bad car Costumization. So get this game only when it goes on Sale, i dont recommend you to buy it at full price,Now for Pros and Cons:+ Preety good story that can keep you playing for 1 week just for the stories. I say this because i have completed the story for 2nd time and it still enjoyable :D+ Large map you can travel across USA and it takes roughly 30-50 minutes to travel from Chicago to Miami. Imagine going from side to side :D Really fun for cruising around good scenery.+ Have diffrent kind of weather, like Rain, Snow, Thunderstorm, Sunny. If they add Tornadoes it would be so cool!+ Monster Trucks, Dragster and Drift spec, Lovin It!+ BIKES makes your game more easier to beat hahahaha+ Decent graphic after the Wild Run update.Now for the cons:- Bad costumization option.- Lack of Japanese car and some old European cars. Too much supercars here.- PVP not so good right now, but still enjoyable though.- Online feature in this game still kinda meh. Like Crew feature is kinda useless here which is they promised to #NeverDriveAlone but for me its #AlwaysDriveAlone.So you may ask ""Do you Recommend it?"" then My answer is, If you REALLY REALLY want to play an Arcade Racer then get this game. Becaus its currently the decent Arcade racer game you can get for PC right now, When NFS released i wont recommend you to get this game tho.			"

												I like this game... its got great potiential... its fun and you can easily spend hours and hours running around the USA doing lots of different kind of races... I really Like it and I'm sure it will get better... yeah its over a year old but they still are updating it and I'm sure preparing for The Crew 2!I really don't understand all the negative posts... I'll try to address those that I have read...Price... All games drop in price as they get older that is normal and nothing to gripe about it happenes to EVERY game! If its too much wait for it to go on sale as I do.DLCs... this is just the way games are updated now-a-days if you want them to continue to update your game, pay for it!BUGS... All games will have bugs and they will be fixed in time... deal with it or wait for the final versions.as far as I am concerened none of the above issues are valid issues to call a game negative its jus tthe way games are devloped if you don't like there go find another hobby... if you are always thinking negative thingabout game then NONE will be fun and you'll never like any game you buy... in fact I bet mose of the negative reviews are from people that give negative reviews on FREE games!Any ways...if you like racing games - Buy itIf you like cars and upgrading them BUY IT!if you like a game that will givbe you hours of fun... buy it!if you like driving... bit it!there are many more reason I'd list but I'd reather be playing.... I like it!there is just so so many things to do and places to go so go BUY it and have fun!			"

												Having waited for it to arrive with huge anticipation it was a strain waiting  again for it to download and install.  Slow internet here it took five hours.Having started the game I had a lot of trouble getting it to run without crashing or working properly with my G27.  I waited for a patch before I tried again, not the same without the wheel, sure enough the patch sorted some of my problems.  So on with the game. If you want a racing game this is not for you, the cars look great but the handling is nothing but abismal.  There is no feel it's as bad as Watch Dogs, which is awful to say the least.Lovely graphics, nice idea, but it's not a racing game, better to wait for something better like Project Cars.  All in all a massive disapointment and very little incentive to play it again even after the short time I have used it.			"

												There's nothing wrong with the game idea or the graphics. BUT.... there's a lot of bugs and crashes that makes this game not even close to what it cost. I would pay max 10£ for this game with all this♥♥♥♥♥♥bugs appearing every time I play this game. It's a shame though.

												I cannot reccomend this game in its current state. It's in a obvious beta form, which is unthinkable given how there were 3 open betas before release. It's like Ivory Tower has never made a driving game before. And it IS a driving game, not a racing game. It's all variations of 'point-a-to-point-b' in this game, unless you're being chased by the police or a gang. The AI racers rubberband incredibly badly, the AI police/gang chase vehicles are moving brick walls that can go faster than you on any terrain and can only be outrun through sheer luck. Totally unplayable to people who don't min/max. Sometimes in Freeroam a cop will glitch out and try to arrest you, even though you don't have a wanted level (though him ramming you will cause you to gain one soon enough). The car handling model is hellishly bad when the car is low level and either fun but challenging or boring as hell at high levels depending on the car. The graphics are outdated and has a fair share of bugs. The antialising (aka the anti-pixelation stuff) is pretty much nonexistent, which makes areas with lots of foliage an eyesore. The instances flat out don't work. You can't ever connect to friends or even your crew once you've moved out of the instance you met in, unless you get rematched together out of sheer luck. PvP isn't balanced at all. If you crash once, you lose. If you don't have a fully-specced supercar, you lose. Simple. Money is attained primarily through a system wherein people on your friends list can be used as ammo to start a 3-hour timer to do faction missions in order to get 1/4 the award of the normal payout. All other moneymaking is completely moot.  The endgame is an interminable grind to max out your favorite cars whilst also micromanaging the above-mentioned grinding system. The cars are not very varied- the majority are american muscle cars and random supercars, with a few european tuners here and there. The car parts system is not very well explained (what each part do, etc.) and boring as hell, especially given how to get the best parts you must gring the same jump, speed or hill climb 'skills' for around twenty minutes each for each part for each car. Alternatively, you can spend money to buy parts you unlock for one car for the rest of the same spec. This costs a lot of bucks (ingame cash) but not much crew credits (microtransaction money). Hm...Visual customization is pretty varied for each car but you can't ever equip the stock parts of the Fullspec vehicle. Annoying.Specs are not well thought out. Circuit, Perf and Street are all for road driving in descending order of effectiveness. There's no downside to using a circuit over a perf or a perf over a street. Just straight upgrades. Dirt and Raid could have been rolled into one without an issue (Raid goes better off road, dirt goes better on dirt roads). The story is one of the worst I have ever seen, with extremely cardboard characters and a boring revenge plot that has a totally contrived happy ending and no direction whatsoever. Attempts to be heartwarming or funny fell flat, except for one occasion that made me crack a smile; one Chinese 'Vaas' expy in big debt once enthusiatically said simply 'Money money money money money!' to remind me to do a mission to help him.Story missions are cookie-cutter from something like four or five types but with arbitrary additions, i.e. a 'A-to-B' (they actually call them that) could be 'don't take damage' or 'you've got a time limit' or 'you have to escape pursuit before you reach the destination', often without even any in-story justification. Sometimes an NPC will be in the car, giving you an infodump that you probably won't pay attention to while you haul♥♥♥♥♥trying to complete the objectives. Or maybe they'll just yell at you every time you bump something using the same three lines. Ubisoft and Ivory Tower failed on every count reguarding this game. This is despite the Betas and the fact that we know Ubisoft knows how to make a good racing game from Driver: SF. It's incredible how bad this game is. I only play it because I want to get my $85's worth, and I'm hoping they'll fix most of these issues in due time. Knowing Ubisoft, it'll just be more DLC and mircrotransactions, but just maybe...TL;DR This game has literally every bad element of every bad driving game ever. Don't buy it.   "

												This game has a lot of potential.  The biggest problem I have is the AI is ridiculously overpowering when running from police.  They are like tanks that accelerate faster than any car you can buy.  They will push you right off the road but are impossible to be moved or budged themselves.    Also, the handling on some of these cars is whack.  Not so bad that the game can't be played, and I really like the game even with the ridiculously hard to kill cops.  There aren't very many people playing this game, dare I say 'yet'?  This game seems to be one of those game where you buy it and get hooked, and then they start releasing more stuff at extra charges.  It'd be nice someone made a complete game before they sold it to people.All in all, I like the game, and will keep playing, but only because I've already got it.			"

												Having waited for it to arrive with huge anticipation it was a strain waiting  again for it to download and install.  Slow internet here it took five hours.Having started the game I had a lot of trouble getting it to run without crashing or working properly with my G27.  I waited for a patch before I tried again, not the same without the wheel, sure enough the patch sorted some of my problems.  So on with the game. If you want a racing game this is not for you, the cars look great but the handling is nothing but abismal.  There is no feel it's as bad as Watch Dogs, which is awful to say the least.Lovely graphics, nice idea, but it's not a racing game, better to wait for something better like Project Cars.  All in all a massive disapointment and very little incentive to play it again even after the short time I have used it.			"

												MUST NOT BUY for following major reasons:1. EXTREMELY BUGGY since the launch of game. Unacceptable issues has been brought up with almost every month's patch which makes us nearly think they're here to make the game worse: how the car viewing angle turned 90deg with chase cam when your car's overlapping another opponent's car in no collision race (solved), stuttering issues for high-end PCs (NOT SOLVED AFTER A YEAR), nitrous not working for online races with manual without at least 1 car reset since Wild Run, NOT SOLVED WHAT THE... , and this March patch what has just turned up? ATI and Nvidea graphics users might not even able to start the game and game crash straight away.2. RUBBISH car physics. Even by arcade standards the physics are pure trolls, EVEN AFTER WILD RUN. For god sake Ubisoft your game engine is based on Atari's Test Drive Unlimited 2. How the hell  could you possibly make it so much worse than that game what the FU*K? O_O TDU2 at least has friendly controls while still retains bit of realism, if by no means much ... but you Ubi, bikes that can go to complete stop from 350km/h/220MPH in less than 2 seconds plus hit the wall at almost 90deg and still no crash, catch-up mechanics and INSANE AMOUNT of slipstream that can allow a car to override top speed by 70km/h and TOTALLY ruins online competition, collision physics that allows your car to ""skid"" past traffic even when u hit them head on, race cars that can go 420km/h with those huge wings+corner 50% faster than in reality ... it's honestly disgusting in its own way. I rather have something even more detached from reality (e.g. Burnout, Ridge Racer) than experiencing your half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥efforts trying to go for poor extents of realism.2.5. Extra steering rate for non-DirectInput controllers and steering wheels. Ehm yes ... if u uses either 1 of them you have an unfair advantage of being able to steer the front wheels so much at any speeds and the car can still response to such even at likes of 300km/h because of bullsh*t overpowered tire physics.3. Poor online structure. In simplest terms, The Crew uses some of the worst multiplayer connection programming which results in players in the same lobby who're not host to have latency. This often ends up with the host ""off-sync"" from his actual positions causing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff including both palyers slipstreaming each other on their own screens and the 3th place host player in a close finish ended up 1st in result screen. ""Summit"" tracks also lacking checkpoints real badly, forcing top players to go for insane shortcuts for majority of them.If you really want to buy a racing game from Ubisoft, honestly, I rather hope you may consider trying out ""POD GOLD"" which is from the f**k-graphics 90s and you can download from GOG site for just $5.99 featuring compatibility for Windows 7 or above. Yes it's full arcade physics and no graphics quality to talk about, but it's got beautifully designed track layout + AI difficulty that can put you to smile for losing so badly just like those games in arcade centres. I can safely bet for most POD is even better than this piece of typical modern crap which other gaming companies seemed to have learnt from EA's NFS somehow just to steal money from kids. Topping with Ubi's Assassin's incident, I swear I would never buy Ubi's racing game for the 3rd time.			"

												Absolute piece of rubbish. From the unwanted Wild Run ""upgrade"" that is one big advertisement for the Wild Run DLC, to the inexplicable graphical and physics bugs, and the rubberbanding AI, stay away from this game. It doesn't matter if you are a fan of racing games or massive open worlds, this game is not worth your time. Trust me, I've played 100+ hours and I just had the final straw. While playing a long-running faction mission (> 1 hr long) the road disappeared and left me unable to steer, accelerate or brake. I had to abort the mission. The usual fix of bringing up the map doesn't work because you can't bring up the map during missions. If you are a fan of games that have a well-designed difficulty progression then this game is not for you, either. Some missions are overly easy and others that are ranked as easy are next to impossible. Likewise, some hard-ranked missions are way too easy. It's as if random goals were set for each mission and the difficulty rankings were randomly set as well. That said, if you like games where you have to grind to progress, then this game is for you. Not only do you have to grind for upgrades, but just playing the game is a grind. In my experience the most fun thing to do in the game is to free drive with your friends, and not the game itself.

												I've had the great pleasure to watch this game blossom from a good idea, to an E3 announcement, to a closed Beta, and then to the released product with constant updates! I've had great pleasure driving in this most massive map, particularly the offroading, the dirt-biking and the skill challenges. I've aimed for and earned the Hummer H1 from the first two weeks of gameplay, and I've taken hundreds and hundreds of screenshots through the excellent Photo Mode feature. Great gameplay, great map, amazing vehicles. Looking forward to the police expansion and the Jeep Wrangler introduction in the next few days! I can't say quite clearly enough how this is the most complete and gracious racing video-game. Congratulations, Ubisoft! My highest regards!			"

Pros- Decent wheel support for an ""arcade driving"" title. At least with a Logitech G27.- OK car physics and handling. Hardcore ""petroheads"" are probably going to laugh at this but from my experience, car handling is fun AND challenging.- Huge and very diverse environment. Driving game with huge environment are not exactly common so...- Nice graphics during sunrise and sunset: Very impressive lightning.Cons- Extremely poor support of TrackIR. Cannot even look behind with it while you can with the mouse!- Glitches: All over the place. Floating cars, ""cars inside"" the road, floating rocks, slight but constant stuttering when loading assets. Heck, during a cut-scene, my car literally went through a prop in the scene!- Intense network rubber banding/teleportation of other players cars.- Washed out, ugly lightning effect during storm and raining... Nights are also very dark. Lightning is not consistent: Range from superb sunrise/sunset to WTF moments at night and during cloudy weather. - The game use some sort of ""instancing"" where players are not necessarily going to encounter each other, even when exactly at the same spot on the map.- Lots of DLC exclusive content and ""buyable with real currency"" cars. Not a fan of the latest.- Of course, UPlay, which totally sucks. Add another layer of unneeded complexity to the whole experience. So, if I could, I would give a ""maybe"" rating. But I can't so, I have to rate it negatively.If you like sand box, non-hardcore driving game, you might find it interesting. Exploring the map is a blast... but expect glitches. Get it during a sale at 50%-80% rebate.			"

												When im being chased by police in this game it makes me rage more than call of duty because you can be 2 miles away and somehow their crown victoria can catch up to you within 5 seconds.Pros :- Great map, it's really awesome;- Graphics are good;- Cockpit view, the interiors are well designed;- Simcade driving is fun;- Many specs ( Street, Dirt, Performance, Raid and Circuit ).Cons:- Lack of cars, only 47 fullstock cars (if I'm not wrong.);- Exterior car custimization is just poor:- 200 rims ? And you get like the same rim with 3/5 different colors. - The bumpers, some of them the only thing that changes is the headlights.- Stickers, pre-made stickers that you can't even change the color of them;- The MMO , ... when you launch the game you can see like 100 people on the same server as you, but while you are on free-roam you can see up to 8 people. That's like driving offline, with an option to PVP that will take you to a lobby with 4~8 people to race against.- Cockpit view:- When PVPing if there's no collison , the other player will just pass by your car and you won't be able to see nothing in from of you, only a black shade of your oponent.- In cockpit view your mirrors don't work;- AI , the AI is just impossible, if you are being chased by the police it's really hard to escape. You can go 400 km/h with a Circuit SLS on an Highway that a Ford Crown Victoria will chase you down. - Some of the game physics are just out of this world:- You get rammed by another player or a AI car your car just fly's away, you try to ram a cop you get stucked.- You hit a fence or a pile of garbage on the sidewalk you lose like 10/20 km/h;- PVPing, sometimes you need to wait 5 minutes to join a lobby to get rammed mostly.- In PVP the lobby leader (the player with most wins) is the one who dictates wich track you are going to play and the settings, with or without traffic/collision, instead of being choosen by a vote among the lobby players.(...)And there's the Crew Credits, that for me it's neutral, in my point of view they are there to help people that lack of time to ""farm"" money to buy a car that they like, or parts of it, for people that buy the game to play 3/5hours a week.Because you can easily make money doing pvp races (15~18k bucks each race and with perks the most expensive car is like 708k), you can buy all the cars and parts without having to buy the CC's.Should you buy the game?Yes/No.- Yes, if you are into this type of games, but buy it heavly discounted.- No, if you buying it full price, because for the price that they are asking for it they should give players way more stuff and not this. To me this was the most expensive ""early-acess"" that I've ever bought.			"

												I am in two minds about this game. The gameplay itself is quite enjoyable, it's an arcadey racer much like Driver San Francisco. But there are far too many flaws for me to recommend this. 1) The grind! If you want a decent car you better be prepared to either grind tedious missions over and over or buy some in game credit. Most missions net you 2k, but top of the range cars come in at 700k not including the tuning which some will set you back 500k. That's a lot of grinding for little reward.2) The story is abysmal, I didn't care at all about what was going on or who these people were. Which would be ok if it wasn't for;3) The missions. The missions in this game is the same repetitive few types with different locations/cars. It will either be a race (by far the best), an escape from the cops mission, a checkpoint time trial or a Smugglers Run esque cargo smash. That is as deep as they get and you will soon get bored. 4) Little reward. I don't really consider this a spoiler and I think perspective buyers should be aware. There is no reward for completing the story. No car. No paint job and just the same diddly amount of cash as the rest of the missions. 5) Always online and Uplay. Not really an issue for me but understand this is important for people with limited internet connectionsThat being said there are some positive points to this game. The map is huge and full of landmarks, the Wild Run add on creates a bit more variety, and if you manage to get a crew cruising round the U.S.A can be fun. I have played this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and it will work ok, but the arcade controls are far more suited to a controller, both controller types are supported well with mappable button configs.All in all I can't really recommend this game, especially not at full price, but it may be worth a punt on sale if you are looking for an easy on the eye arcade racing sandbox. It is what it is, and is easilly worth getting on the cheap for the map and crew antics alone.			"

												What The Crew gets right is its stylised and scaled-down version of the entire continental USA. Cities are shrunken caricatures, but the truly vast sweeping tracts of land between them means traversing it really does capture the spirit of a cross-country, city-to-city road trip better than any driving game before it. Plenty of racing games curate a bunch of different backdrops into their track selections, from urban street races in major American metropolitan centres to icy blasts across snow-swept mountains, flat-out sprints across the baking desert, or muddy expeditions through giant Sequoia forests. The Crew admirably does all this in a single game world you can drive across in one lengthy session.This girth has come at a cost, though. It’s a world that looks fine whipping by you at speed, but it favours sheer size over the kind of granular detail we now expect in modern open world racers. Cities are smattered with recognisable landmarks but don’t really seem built to stand up to stationary scrutiny. Combined with low-detailed NPC cars (complete with entirely black, opaque glass), some forgettable effects (splashing water is especially dire), no weather, and the fact that the models of the 40-or-so cars are in a league below those of contemporaries like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub, The Crew struggles to shake the look of a game several years older than it actually is.

												Nice race game whit decent (last gen) graphics.And whit that i think i've said everything.The game has been downgrade A LOT ! to match the older xbox and ps to.The game has a weak story line, music sucks and the map...It is supose to be in Amerika but does it not even looks like Amerika whatsoever...You know you in Amerika cus you wil run into some objects that tell you you are but thats it.The mirrors in the car just simple plain stupid don't work... IT IS 2015!!! ,,, ( uhh was it? )The offroad handling is worse then the new drift systeem that is comming to the crew at a later dlc.It doesn't make you feel you are driving offroad. it looks like you trying to use you bike in 3 meter high snow.After you have beaten the story, or gave up on it and lvlt though till cap.You will notice that you unlock the big races, those races are pvp aswel as pve.Which is more the way to make money because there is no other way.So you will find yourself driving a race in real time taking you 3 hours for a 1 mill reward.You don't have a real garage or any engine customization.yes this should be a thumb down. but on pc this is all we got now.And it is better then need for speed world ever would be.But worth a pricetag of 14.99 comparing the quality of the devs putting in the game.

												I don't really recommend it, it was way over-hyped and is terrible in many ways. The beta was way better. After the beta and release, the AI rubberbands and it's terrible, the servers suck, and the car health and damage was taken out.------------Pros: - Huge World, variety of envrionments, cockpits are nice, some envrionments look nice.------------Cons: - TERRIBLE physics, terrible AI, Terrible races, cop chases, the cities are tiny, a lot of copy and paste, could use more cars, customization was over-hyped, boring story and campaign, poorly optimized, servers suck (NOT AN MMO), micro-transactions (After spending $60, really?), speedometer is off, roads feel like ice, damage physics are bad and weird, Uplay, and the fact it's published by Ubisoft.------------It would of been a cool racer, but all of these things make it quite boring and very over-hyped and dissapointing. Ubisoft probably pushed the game so it screwed up.------------Even on sale, don't purchase, you'll be dissapointed.			"

												I have to say this game is sometimes horible to play on the pc. I mostly got it because of the story and the fact you got to drive in the US. But this game is glitchy at times and the scenary is mostly bad. Of course though this game is suited for low graphics range that makes the game more playable but makes the scenary worse. I don't reccomend you get it on the pc but do get on the PS4. If you have shortage of screen cut off that is mostly because you may not have 1080p. That is okay, still play it!			"

												For a game that was intended to be fully about player custimization and choices. As well as a huge diversity in the way you drive. This game falls short. Extremely short. This is by far one of the worst excuses for a racing game I have ever seen, after the first hour or two, you'll be completely bored and out of will to do more of the grindy missions, with the generic story. But then again, it's a Ubisoft game, we can't get our hopes up with them folks, they are one of the WORST names in gaming as of 2016, stop buying their cashgrabs and trash, I surely will.			"

												The Crew is basically what people wanted after black box got fired. It has a big map that can take minutes to hours to explore with a lot of variety when it comes to terrain and climate. There is hidden wrecks that you can find across the map with different specs such as Street Dirt raid perf and curcuit. Most of the wrecks are hot rod based and they have a lot of features when it comes to customization. There is a lot of customization in the game such as bumpers spoilers skirts vinyls rims paint but there is something that has been bugging me and that is that some cars doesn't have that much customization options if not anything at all. Like the maserati gran turismo s you basically have no options here except for changing the OFFICIAL rims or the OFFICIAL colours. You can't customize the gran turismo s. And in curcuit spec there isn't that much options either you basically get a big body kit but with no options to change it. Just like raid spec you only get that 1 body kit. Also there is a lot of cars / specs from the trailer missing in the game and cars that I would love to be in the game. there is only 2 import tuners in the game and that is the 370z and the skyline R34. Where is the Evo's or the RX7 / RX8's Supra's GT86's ETC? The 2012 Dodge charger has mitsubishi evo parts but it isn't the same. The story is very short and very difficult trough the end most likely just to make the gameplay longer. I'm not sure if this game was rushed or they just lost their creativity but if you bought this game just for the story you will be very dissapointed. It feels like the full game didn't include the full story and it just ended too fast.The physics are very weird in this game. Sometimes you will get random cutscenes where your car flips and crashes which is skip-able but still can get annoying at times. ESPECIALLY during missions or pvp races.After exploring almost every part of the  crew bought and customized almost every car in the game and found almost all of the wrecks there isn't that much to do anymore. Sure it is fun to do road trips at times but it can get very repetetive.Overall: Awesome game for cruising and customization but it lacks some features such as fenders specs and cars. Especially japanese cars which highly dissapointed me because there is only 2 japanese cars in the game :S Huge map with a lot of different areas to explore and cruise with your friends.8/10			"

Posted: December 6, 2014
												I will write a quick, straight on review for those who are wonder how the game is.This come from 33 hours of gameplay, story done, top 90th in pvp some days ago.There are things that bothers me about the game:-Customization part is that there aren't really many hoods, bumpers and stuff to chose from they mostly have little details changing between them, and they are usually tied to a spec, so this mean, no Skyline stock hood on a Perfomance spec Skyline! Bumpers and the rest are usually repetitive, not to mention the vynils You can't change their colours.-MMO feeling, this is the misleading part. In your world (your session) you will only be able to see 8 players on the whole US (at least for now) Yes, 8 this is not your typical MMORPG where you see hundred of people. So keep that in mind if you were thinking about it- Lack of JDM cars: Only three. Ain't gonna describe this much, just three, the rest is almost entire muscle cars with some european exceptions._______________________________________________________________________Story is entertaining, not much to add into this part, characters are fine, not precisely boring, but nothing out of this world :]Cops are incredibly fast, think about artificial difficulty, just like that, a crown vic can catch your LaFerrari full throttle, something like Most Wanted, but way more aggresive, if you like challenges, then i guess you will like it, but sometimes, it's a bit unfair, and they don't share the same physics as your car (you can't slam them offroad, they are like anchors)One important thing, people tend to whine about the boat handling like GTA IV. It gets A LOT better on the mid-end game, the starter cars are the problem, and the fact it's a MMO, you NEED to level up to get better handling, speed, and so on, and it is highly recommend to play without assists.Cars are all the same performance wise when you upgrade their parts to max, this means that if you are not a 16 y/o bugatti fan, your favorite $50k grand car will be able to compete to an Agera R and not remain obsolete in the the early levels!Cruising on the states is an amazing feeling, at least that's what i felt since im kind of NA enthusiast in the future. Just keep in mind that this game is way better with friends, so you better get someone in with you. It will make the exploration feeling incredible, and there are plenty of stuff to do. From Skills, to PvP, and Co-Op missions (races up to 2,5h and maybe more!)To finish this quick review, my final words:I think the game is on sale somewhere (christmas season maybe?)Is the game worth it's full price? If you ask me, i do not regret it. Is it fun even in solo? It is, yeah pretty much. Will it be supported for a long time? It's a game that doesn't have a direct competitor on PC, so think about it :]See you in the States if you decide to give it a try! Claxon me up if you see a Gun Metal Gray R34 rocketing on the roads ;]			"

												Prelude and Tl;Dr    I beta-tested The Crew back when it was first announced for beta, and at that point I believed there was true potential to the game. The story, while cliche, wasn't terrible like some other racing games of late. A large and open world full of sights, and iconic cars. BUT, as release came, I am left wondering what if anything they did, Servers are worse than anything I have experienced, Only 25ish cars, physics that beg belief, and a map upon further inspection leaves you scratching your head in disbelief at the laziness of the devs. So no I do not recommend this game, it has some good moments in the free driving, yet you still have that nagging presence of all the issues and poor quality.The map    One of the positive things of the Crew is the map, it is big, ~100km across and has some detail in it. Honestly you can spend hours driving and still be discovering new places, which makes cruising down a road and being able to say, ""what is that"" and go find out the best part of the Crew. However the map has massive issues, a mesh that makes even games from the 90's shudder to look at. Case in point, just driving over a desert, which is pretty flat, you will occasionally ramp off and spin out, all due to such a low polygon count that the ground is jagged and often impractical. It is bad enough I will not use my FFB wheel in the crew due to the jolts it will give the mechanisms in the wheel. The textures are barely passable for a game of 2014, and often are quite lack luster. And the bounding boxes on object and the road often do not match the objects and can cause frustrating moments as you spin off or stop dead due to a fence or some invisible outcrop in a building. MAP (6/10).The Cars   there are only ~25 of them, and there isn't much different between them when they are in the respective specs. Also the specs available to put on a car are limited, some cars can have all, while others can only have one spec installed. AWD cars feel like FWD cars, RWD cars feel like drift cars. The Physics are at their best are abysmal and often cause a moment of frustration followed by eruption of laughter as your car is catapulted from hitting a foot high rock into the sky. There is also a general disregard to grip as cars tend to slide more than turn. CARS(5/10) PHYSICS (3/10)The Specs   The specs offer the true differences between cars as some will be off-road ""capable"" (nothing is prepared for the horrible polygon density) and others fast on road. There can be some fun to be had racing the different specs, but the physics issue often steals most of the fun, when the other issues are not. The Missions/Skill Challenges   Fun, for the first couple, then a long drag to the end, often making you look at the next mission and groan. The race type is straight forward, the checkpoint missions often are the only ones that are enjoyable, the takedown missions are messed up and often don't recognize the hits, and the smash the crates are just plain idiotic. As for the skill challenges... Jumps are awesome, speeds makes you hate the traffic, scrambles frustrate, race lines are meh, presicion frustrates, slaloms make you hate traffic, seeing the pattern? MISSIONs(4/10)The AI   ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than PayDay 2, nuf said... AI(1/10)Servers   Yeah, what servers? Can't stay connected for more than an hour and often dumps you out of the race at the end when in COOP giving you no rewards for the hour long race you just completed. Often can't see friends who are right in front of me. SERVER(0/10)Pay2Win...Summary (4/10)  "

												Me Giving a Bad Rep for this game doen´s mean that I wouldn´t recommend it all, but the thing is: The game has too much going against it to really recommend it. The game throws you right into the Actionand it gives you some nice cars to play with right from the get go and within the first few hours of gameplay you get to drive cars from 4 of the 5 Spec sets so you can get a glimpse of what lies ahead. And you can do all that either on your own or in Co-Op with a Crew of either some random people or with your friends. The game tries to tell a story about revenge and stuff, but it is so narrow with unintresting characters that it makes Fast and Furious look like The Godfather in comparsion. However I do like the variety in gameplay, you get to drive some races, escape the cops every once in a while, take down a target, destroy some boxes for reasons or just try to get to the finish line within a timelimit. All that both on- and off-road. I also like the huge map, you need roughly 90 minutes to get from New York City to Los Angeles, and just to make sure that you don´t get bored during your road trips you get tons of little Skill Challenges all over the Place, these range from jumps to Race Line challenges and you can win parts to updgrade your car and money in these challenges. The Map itself is basicly a compressed Hollywood Version of the entire USA (not Including Alaska and Hawaii) without all that boring stuff. It´s the first time in an Open World Racing game that I don´t feel that the game world is limited too much.You can visit tons of famous Towns and Landmarks, the map also Includes some, honestly bad, recreations of real life racetracks, you get everything from the time Square to the Hollywood Hills, you can drive up the Pikes Peak or reach insane Speeds on the Boneville Salt Flats, you can Visit Mount Rushmoore, the Swamps in the Southern Regions, take a road trip along the Route 66. You get the point. The Car Handling takes a while to get used to, but once you figured out how to drift around corners it gets much easier because you would have to slow down way too much to drive around corners the regular way.However here is why I don´t recommend it, and uPlay isn´t any of the reasons, I don´t mind it too much. The game requires you to be online all the time, if the servers goes offline for whatever reason or you loose the connection the game throws you out of whatever you are doing, even if that means that loose your 3 Hour Progress into an almost 4 Hour long race. However there is no real reason that the game has to be connected to a server at any point because you can do everything on your own. Also the game is NOT an MMO in the classical sense, while in Free Drive you randomly drop In and Out off Online Lobbys, players inside a Lobby can Invite others into their Crew and play Story-, Faction- and PVP-Events together. A Crew can have up to 4 Players and all 4 will Drop In and Out off the Sessions together. While it works, it almost feels like a gimmick to me.I have a feeling that the car Levels and Perks don´t mean anything, at least when there is AI Involved. The game has some of the worst rubberbanding AI I encountered in over 20 Years of playing Racing games, even with cars close to Level 900 you can´t really drive away from the Low Level AI in the earliest Missions th game has to offer. When Playing PvP the Car Levely do Matter, however a goog driver can still beat a car that is 200+ Levels above him when the other driver isn´t that experienced. The whole concept is untransparent, you never get a feeling that all the carparts you collect even do anything.Also it throws you the Option for Microtransactions in your Face every time you are anywhere where you can buy stuff within the game. You can get everything without ever using them, but I get a strong feeling that you don´t earn money fast enough in the game so they can sell more micro Transactions.			"

												Got the gold edition. This game is absolutely TERRIBLE. It crashes randomly for no apparent reason after 5-10 minutes of gameplay.. MANY people in the Steam community have had this issue for a very long time, and only with this game... Despite numerous complaints in Steam forum and the game developers forums; they have not fixed this issue at all. All the $ I invested into this game bought a BIG frustrating headache of inablity to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time without it crashing. I re-installed the Operating System and all the latest drivers twice, on two seperate machines and then re-installed this game twice and the problem did not get resolved. This is NOT a hardware issue, but a well known problem reported by many who own this game--that has not been fixed in many, many months. Trust me please, save your $ and don't buy this!! If they fix it I will change my review, but until they fix it DO NOT BUY IT. You will deeply regret it as so many of us have.			"

												[Closed BETA Review]Finally a good competitor against NFS. I'm a huge fan of NFS series myself. I have all PC versions of them since 1994. And i can tell, in my opinion, that this game made the perfect balance that EA didn't do in 20 years: A vast and consistent open world (also real places), mix the simulation and arcade style, and have cars for other purposes (Dirt and Raid).Looking forward to see the final version.[Final Version Review]Although i maintain most of my previous statements, after playing almost 100 hours, here's my considerations:-They managed to make a worst history telling than EA. Too much clichè, weak story. -No invisible walls! NICE!-The car selection is modest, but they say there will be more cars, so ok...-They could improve the physiscs.-The graphic is amazing. I give you that.-There are races with 2h duration on the game that award a good money. But UPlay is very unstable and after a few frustrations i quit trying to do that races, because if you're disconnected for some reason (most of the case is their fault), you lose the race and all your effort.-The police has some tactics, do PIT maneuvers, has helicopters, but i think there could be more challenge.

												Prelude and Tl;Dr    I beta-tested The Crew back when it was first announced for beta, and at that point I believed there was true potential to the game. The story, while cliche, wasn't terrible like some other racing games of late. A large and open world full of sights, and iconic cars. BUT, as release came, I am left wondering what if anything they did, Servers are worse than anything I have experienced, Only 25ish cars, physics that beg belief, and a map upon further inspection leaves you scratching your head in disbelief at the laziness of the devs. So no I do not recommend this game, it has some good moments in the free driving, yet you still have that nagging presence of all the issues and poor quality.The map    One of the positive things of the Crew is the map, it is big, ~100km across and has some detail in it. Honestly you can spend hours driving and still be discovering new places, which makes cruising down a road and being able to say, ""what is that"" and go find out the best part of the Crew. However the map has massive issues, a mesh that makes even games from the 90's shudder to look at. Case in point, just driving over a desert, which is pretty flat, you will occasionally ramp off and spin out, all due to such a low polygon count that the ground is jagged and often impractical. It is bad enough I will not use my FFB wheel in the crew due to the jolts it will give the mechanisms in the wheel. The textures are barely passable for a game of 2014, and often are quite lack luster. And the bounding boxes on object and the road often do not match the objects and can cause frustrating moments as you spin off or stop dead due to a fence or some invisible outcrop in a building. MAP (6/10).The Cars   there are only ~25 of them, and there isn't much different between them when they are in the respective specs. Also the specs available to put on a car are limited, some cars can have all, while others can only have one spec installed. AWD cars feel like FWD cars, RWD cars feel like drift cars. The Physics are at their best are abysmal and often cause a moment of frustration followed by eruption of laughter as your car is catapulted from hitting a foot high rock into the sky. There is also a general disregard to grip as cars tend to slide more than turn. CARS(5/10) PHYSICS (3/10)The Specs   The specs offer the true differences between cars as some will be off-road ""capable"" (nothing is prepared for the horrible polygon density) and others fast on road. There can be some fun to be had racing the different specs, but the physics issue often steals most of the fun, when the other issues are not. The Missions/Skill Challenges   Fun, for the first couple, then a long drag to the end, often making you look at the next mission and groan. The race type is straight forward, the checkpoint missions often are the only ones that are enjoyable, the takedown missions are messed up and often don't recognize the hits, and the smash the crates are just plain idiotic. As for the skill challenges... Jumps are awesome, speeds makes you hate the traffic, scrambles frustrate, race lines are meh, presicion frustrates, slaloms make you hate traffic, seeing the pattern? MISSIONs(4/10)The AI   ♥♥♥♥♥♥ than PayDay 2, nuf said... AI(1/10)Servers   Yeah, what servers? Can't stay connected for more than an hour and often dumps you out of the race at the end when in COOP giving you no rewards for the hour long race you just completed. Often can't see friends who are right in front of me. SERVER(0/10)Pay2Win...Summary (4/10)  "

												Me Giving a Bad Rep for this game doen´s mean that I wouldn´t recommend it all, but the thing is: The game has too much going against it to really recommend it. The game throws you right into the Actionand it gives you some nice cars to play with right from the get go and within the first few hours of gameplay you get to drive cars from 4 of the 5 Spec sets so you can get a glimpse of what lies ahead. And you can do all that either on your own or in Co-Op with a Crew of either some random people or with your friends. The game tries to tell a story about revenge and stuff, but it is so narrow with unintresting characters that it makes Fast and Furious look like The Godfather in comparsion. However I do like the variety in gameplay, you get to drive some races, escape the cops every once in a while, take down a target, destroy some boxes for reasons or just try to get to the finish line within a timelimit. All that both on- and off-road. I also like the huge map, you need roughly 90 minutes to get from New York City to Los Angeles, and just to make sure that you don´t get bored during your road trips you get tons of little Skill Challenges all over the Place, these range from jumps to Race Line challenges and you can win parts to updgrade your car and money in these challenges. The Map itself is basicly a compressed Hollywood Version of the entire USA (not Including Alaska and Hawaii) without all that boring stuff. It´s the first time in an Open World Racing game that I don´t feel that the game world is limited too much.You can visit tons of famous Towns and Landmarks, the map also Includes some, honestly bad, recreations of real life racetracks, you get everything from the time Square to the Hollywood Hills, you can drive up the Pikes Peak or reach insane Speeds on the Boneville Salt Flats, you can Visit Mount Rushmoore, the Swamps in the Southern Regions, take a road trip along the Route 66. You get the point. The Car Handling takes a while to get used to, but once you figured out how to drift around corners it gets much easier because you would have to slow down way too much to drive around corners the regular way.However here is why I don´t recommend it, and uPlay isn´t any of the reasons, I don´t mind it too much. The game requires you to be online all the time, if the servers goes offline for whatever reason or you loose the connection the game throws you out of whatever you are doing, even if that means that loose your 3 Hour Progress into an almost 4 Hour long race. However there is no real reason that the game has to be connected to a server at any point because you can do everything on your own. Also the game is NOT an MMO in the classical sense, while in Free Drive you randomly drop In and Out off Online Lobbys, players inside a Lobby can Invite others into their Crew and play Story-, Faction- and PVP-Events together. A Crew can have up to 4 Players and all 4 will Drop In and Out off the Sessions together. While it works, it almost feels like a gimmick to me.I have a feeling that the car Levels and Perks don´t mean anything, at least when there is AI Involved. The game has some of the worst rubberbanding AI I encountered in over 20 Years of playing Racing games, even with cars close to Level 900 you can´t really drive away from the Low Level AI in the earliest Missions th game has to offer. When Playing PvP the Car Levely do Matter, however a goog driver can still beat a car that is 200+ Levels above him when the other driver isn´t that experienced. The whole concept is untransparent, you never get a feeling that all the carparts you collect even do anything.Also it throws you the Option for Microtransactions in your Face every time you are anywhere where you can buy stuff within the game. You can get everything without ever using them, but I get a strong feeling that you don´t earn money fast enough in the game so they can sell more micro Transactions.			"

												Got the gold edition. This game is absolutely TERRIBLE. It crashes randomly for no apparent reason after 5-10 minutes of gameplay.. MANY people in the Steam community have had this issue for a very long time, and only with this game... Despite numerous complaints in Steam forum and the game developers forums; they have not fixed this issue at all. All the $ I invested into this game bought a BIG frustrating headache of inablity to play the game for more than 15 minutes at a time without it crashing. I re-installed the Operating System and all the latest drivers twice, on two seperate machines and then re-installed this game twice and the problem did not get resolved. This is NOT a hardware issue, but a well known problem reported by many who own this game--that has not been fixed in many, many months. Trust me please, save your $ and don't buy this!! If they fix it I will change my review, but until they fix it DO NOT BUY IT. You will deeply regret it as so many of us have.			"

												[Closed BETA Review]Finally a good competitor against NFS. I'm a huge fan of NFS series myself. I have all PC versions of them since 1994. And i can tell, in my opinion, that this game made the perfect balance that EA didn't do in 20 years: A vast and consistent open world (also real places), mix the simulation and arcade style, and have cars for other purposes (Dirt and Raid).Looking forward to see the final version.[Final Version Review]Although i maintain most of my previous statements, after playing almost 100 hours, here's my considerations:-They managed to make a worst history telling than EA. Too much clichè, weak story. -No invisible walls! NICE!-The car selection is modest, but they say there will be more cars, so ok...-They could improve the physiscs.-The graphic is amazing. I give you that.-There are races with 2h duration on the game that award a good money. But UPlay is very unstable and after a few frustrations i quit trying to do that races, because if you're disconnected for some reason (most of the case is their fault), you lose the race and all your effort.-The police has some tactics, do PIT maneuvers, has helicopters, but i think there could be more challenge. Also spike strips, rhino units and faster backups.-The car tuning and custom parts are good. Could be more options though.-The rubberband AI levels in this game is too damn high!-Although they say it's a car MMO, you can only see 7 players max.

												Waste of Money! If you want a racing game buy something with realistic car physics, and something thats not complete crap. Game has micro transactions like most AAA games, Story is a joke, and everytime you start the game you have to listen to a stupud rant. I dont even see a point in completeing the story. Its just a bad game in general. Buy something like project cars or Iracing. Funner experience and alot more player, I have a hard time seeing more than 10 in one game.			"

												T-Boned a car, whilst going 323km/h down a road, launching it vertically 20 meters in the air and 30 meters down the road.Respawned from the crash, car is still in the air10/10 would Crash againEdited Proper Review as of 11/12/2014.Warning 'The Crew' is not a Simulation racing game, it is an ARCADE Racer.if you are looking for a decently fun racing game to play. 'The Crew' is a considerable choice for this.There are few issues however with the game such as.The Cops and pursuers are OP, especially so in the earlier levels of the game. Later on as you become a higher level, they do become less OP, but are still OP but not to the same level as they were when you first begun the game. The cops aren't that hard if you know how to use the Specs of cars properly. There is a large number of people complaining about this issue, most likely a majority of these people, have no clue how to drive each of the specs of cars correctly. (Don't be one of these people, learn the specs correctly).Warning, this isn't a Racing Simulator don't be like the Racing Elitest like those that are prowling the Forums.'The Crew' does have some other teething issues, such as occasional lag during co-op missions, Lack of connectivity to other players and difficulty connecting to friend when attempting to join each others crew's (I'm from a country that the national average internet speed is 10 mbps, and the lag isn't even that horrendous for me) .  These issues, are considered to be Teething issues, as the game hasn't even ben out for 2 full weeks yet, the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about all of these issues aren't taking this into consideration, and these people aren't taking in to consideration that almost no games at launch are 100% Glitch Free / 100% Bug Free / Balance correctly / have no lag and connection between players is working correctly.This being said 'The Crew' is actually quite an enjoyable game to play, as summarised, there are a balancing issues, connectivity issues, etc If you are thinking of purchasing this game, honestly if you don't mind not playing with some friends or dealing with occasional OP AI pursurer/cops, then you should definitely purchase this game.If any of these issues do effect you eg occassional Lag, connectivity issues with friends or you get really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the cops for some reason, as if you have a deep seeded issue with all forms of Law Enforcement. Then i would wait a bit for these issues to be fixed by ubisoft.7/10 (would be 8.5 or 9, if the connectivity issues and balancing issues were corrected :D )			"

												This game statisfy what a good online racer game is supposed to be. most players that did not liked this game plays realistic racers such as Forza or Grand Turismo. as for the other portion of players they will really be pleased whit this game since it have a NFS: Most Wanted and Test Drive Unlimited taste, witch is pretty good for a release from ubisoft, even tho, its true that some bugs remains, as other big games had before when they got out, but we know they will get those bugs fixed, so thats not a big suprise or a big deal about it and it can happen, at least those bugs are noting major, (unless you have a crappy internet connection)For the Interested, here is the Pros/Mids/Cons of the game.PROS++ Racing coop (up to 4 player max per mission or pvp game)+ Very detailed environment (Working NPC's, a lot of Wilflife and alot of map details)+ Better graphics than Test Drive Unlimited 2+ Detailed leaderboards and statistics for everything+ Good car handling and controls (with a few exceptions since its a NFS styled game) + Polices Forces that can chases you almost evrywhere. (give challenge somtimes)+ Open world where you can drive wherever you want (Even discover some easter eggs in the world)+ Good transition between game cinématics and gamplay (So you fell like you gived control of it after mission movies.)+ Posibility to send your friend do faction missions for you. (so you can save time instead of doing a 2h mission for a bit more of easy game money)+ 50 Cars for first release batch (Witch is not bad for a game that features quite detailed car interiors)+ Offers car customisation such as pre-fab vynils/stickers, Rims, Spoilers and some chasis mods. ( Alot more visual customisation to offer compared to TDU2)+ Day and Night Cycle SystemMIDS~~ Servers are down for maintenance sometimes. (yes it can happen, its an online game)~ Uplay Launcher (at least i can be used / merged whit steam tho)~ Storymode is a bit short. (but is still entertaining to watch)~ Missing Mirrors Animations for Cockpit view in some Cars. (they already working on it already for next patch )~ Weather conditions changes only when you go the mountains where there is snow (they might could use a bit rain but its not that bad)~ Can have unblanced AI (depending if you and your crew have to high level gap)CONS-- No offline mode (you need a internet connection to play this game)- No possibility to add your own Music (but you can customise your playlist atleast)- MicrotransactionsSo as so far for the rest for the game and the gamplay itself, the pleasure of free roaming those cars with friends is pretty Neat, if your one of thos players who dislike this game, just go back to driveclub or what so ever other racing sim game you were playing, otherwise if your looking for car tunning, driving everywhere from road to montains, and like fast paced races for the fun of playing it, this game i what you are looking for !All together i would say, ""The Crew"" is a cool game to play for cruising around with Friends or even to play alone i would say, sure the game have some bugs and have a litle lack on MMO since its more concentrated on the NFS genre gamplay but is worth the price when we know they will comme up whit more !(10 thumbs up)Continue the good work Ubi we know that you can do it and update this until perfaction as other titles did before !!(Afterall They made Driver San Fransico a great fun game so why not the crew !)

												(AFTER 20+ HOURS EDIT) This game did not turn out the way it felt early on.

Eventually, you beat the final race, and you've still only got the first car you bought (or in my case with pre-order, a Mclaren). My in-game wallet after the whole story line, was just enough to buy a mid-range car. Anything in the modern era that's considered a ""SuperCar"" was still too much for me, but hey! You can always buy credits on their system to get enough, only a mere $XX.xx+ to unlock this car! Unfortunatly, you can see below from my review, I was hoping this would feel like Test Drive Unlimited, which I have 200+ hours in (on xbox) but it just did not meet up. In test drive, after the story you feel rich, buying mansions, yachts, bugatti veyrons, etc. In this, you'd be lucky to end up with a mid-range prius. Unfortunatly, The 5 other people ever online do not seem to be driving anything in the super car range either, so there's nobody to ask how they made their money. Oh well, another dust collector.(Old Review) What can I say. I'm a sucker for open world racing games.This game feels like TDU3, the game I've always dreamed of. I put many hours on TDU2 (Xbox) and always looked for a game that would compare. Need for speeds customization features have just gone off the radar since they're underground series, which is the only thing that made that series fun. The Crew, although just played in beta, felt like a perfect combination of the two games. A decent amount of cars (Will be 50-60 from what I've heard) lots of customization, and lots of land to drive. It took me about 2.5 hours to drive from New York to San Francisco. I made a few stops in Vegas, Grand Canyon, And other landmarks of course. I can't get enough of this game, and can't wait for the full version to be released.			"

												It is a nice game. It contains a good number of cars and you can modify your cars to go off road or even go fast on road.The story is alsogood. But it still contains some flaws, such as the DLC ,it possible to participate on some parts of the dlc,like you can get the crates and getting away from the cops in the new DLC ,but in the wild run you cant acces the summit unless you have the DLC Wild run,but you can still see the summit competitions on the map,which can get a bit frustrating.Although, The Crew is still a game with few flaws,I can still recomend for people who love racing games and car enthusiasts out there. And who knows, you may want to try it yourself.			"

												So i'm kinda going to start with the things that are bad with the game (that are bad for the moment will say) first the civilian ai in the game are the worst ai I have encountred in a car game but still you can avoid them fairly easy just that sometimes they are really like determed to stop you and just trying to make you fail the second thing is that you will either find it hard or even impossible to play with your friends and have a crew with three other people at the same time I can join in a crew with all my friends but all of them can't join each other some of them can't join each other witch make it hard to play with all of them but I can still join with one or two of them at the same time so it's enough right now I guess and remember it's still haven't been a week sins launch and it's an mmo and a mmo never has a good lauch they always enounters issus and problems they didn't expect and the crew have been haveing a fairly good start compared to other mmoswhats good with it is the gameplay like the story line that can be a bit hard but you can always have your friends helping you with the missions you find hard and personlly i really like there awards I have almost 7500 AP so far (half of them) because they are fun,challanging and they can take a long time to accomplish and the last thing i want to say about the crew is there faction system witch is great for even if you or your friends have choosed wrong faction so you are in diffrent factions so can you still change faction every seven day to make sure that you are in the same faction and also the faction missions are fun and time comsuming because there is some faction mission that takes over two and a half hour to do and when you do faction missions you get alot of money and some repetetion to your faction witch gives you money ones every day and you do also get RP by doing pvp races I hope that you will buy this game and see for yourself how fun it's and please don't hate it for it issus i'm sure it will be fixed soon			"

												you hit a car with 400 kms per hour, you are still driving. you near miss a car with 60 kms per hour, BAM, you wreck your car. and when you get 100 uplay points and finally get the stunning viper, hit just one sign, and try to drive first person. you just cant because your lovely bumper bumps out like it is trying to reach god and it wont let you drive until you get your car fixed. and well i have been wronged about mirrors my whole life i think because ubisoft told me that mirrors have a grey color and they dont reflect well i guess they dont know what a mirror is, see if you make a racing game, mirrors should reflect. they have LOTS of cars like 30 or 40? :/ are you fkin kidding? even need for speed underground had more. (and weird thing is that i missed underground because at least cars were not worth 5 times a bugatti veyron). i expected that this game would be huge, lots of drivers on servers, no lagging and stuff, but this game showed me that this is just my imagination. the players are laggy and at least a session can contain players up to 8 players!!! YAY! i mean even races in a regular racing game or the races in this game is sometimes with 10 people, what about that? whatever yes i know i have a playtime of 3059672409658246940968 hours or something, but these are the truth.

												This is the best car/racing game i have played for as long as i can remember, but it gets really bad when the ridiculously over powered police come. Seriously, how can a 240hp 2 ton Ford Crown Victory police car catch up to a 600hp+ circuit beast? and not to mention [!!!somewhat of a spoiler!!!] police bus being a faster than a raid monster of a car. I like this game but everytime the police are involved the fun stops.			"

												***Disclamier***I would NOT recommend this game for anyone looking for a driver simulator like Forza or any game similar. This game plays like the classic NFS titles. Arcady and smooth. The damage model is not gonna be like Next Car Game:Wreckfest, itll be like that of NFS. So if your hoping for that be prepared to be disappointed.OkayPro:-Large map and no loading times! (like itll take you about 90mins to drive across the map)-Plenty of challenges aside from the story to improve your driving-PvP!-Lots of cars to pick from-Lots of Customization-No game breaking bugs-Game is optimized/no driver issuesCons:-From what i see you have to earn car parts, you cant buy them. This is what ive seen.-There is an option for micro transactions =/-You must use Uplay-Sometimes players wont populate the map and takes sometime.-I was hoping to be able to create my own decals for my car, everything is predetermined.Overall I would recommend this game. Good arcade driver! Also even though Ubisoft has the publishing on this product, it is Ivory Tower who created the game, which explains a pretty bugless launch compared to previous titles from Ubisoft.			"

												The Crew, one of the best playing, and looking racing games i've played in a long time. Though it is not without its imperfections, the sense of speed is off somewhat, the settings for the handling of the cars took quite a bit of tweaking, as far as I'm aware I wont be able to play with my low level friends once they get this game, and there are quite a few realism complaints I also have.All in all not the worst $60 I've ever spent, but if I were somebody else I would try to get this on sale for $40 or less.TL,DR and cant live without a scorce?7 1/2 / 10 will play for another 21 hours "

												I just spent two and a half hours driving from Chicago to LA along Route 66, obeying speed limits and stopping every now and then to admire the beautiful scenery. Most of the locations in the game have this authentic kind of feeling to them. While the level of detail doesn't match that of GTA V, it's still high enough to make you keep on playing and exploring the vast open map.Apart from that, well, it's a decent multiplayer racing game. The amount of cars to select from isn't exactly whopping, and there is no photo mode to capture the scenery I mentioned earlier. The AI traffic can suddenly take to the skies and Boeing 747's spin around wildly while airborne. But overall, it's an enjoyable experience if you can ignore the servers shutting down every two hours. Hopefully the developers will manage to get rid of that soon.  Simply put, if you liked TDU, NFS:MW, Burnout Paradise, MC:LA and the likes, you will most likely enjoy The Crew as well. You might want to wait for a few weeks before getting it, though.8/10PS: I wouldn't mind an offline mode.			"

But!I opened all the network ports that i need for the game but still no multiplayer, and google for 2 sec and you see im not the only one!Mirrors not working in a race game is not good!Money system is a joke, get arrested will cast you 400$ but 1 race will get you 3000$ but a new car? How about 160,000$But there are races you can do that will give you 80,000$, i just did one 2 hours ago, yes the race was 2 hours long!I still do recommend this game, its a good game but not for 60$!

The game itself is fun with friends, and most of the 22 hrs I've played the game was spent driving coast to coast with my friends. The map is huge and the races are repetitve. If you haven't bought and you enjoy racing games get it. It's not bad but it's also not good. It's average and for some reason I think that is due to it being published by Ubisoft.			"

												I used to consider this to be a great game and would have recommended it, but while I don't regret buying it, I wouldn't say it's worth anything more 60% off retail price, meaning most sales will be meaningless, it's still not worth the buy.As a US cruiser, it's a decent game, though you will suffer from the flat textures on buildings and apauling physics, still, other parts of the game are nice, it's definitely amazing driving through the wild plains, deserts (especially death valley) and the fields of green rolling hills. Cities are just really boring to drive through though.Chances are that after finishing the story, you won't have explored everywhere (and some places are really golden as previously mentioned) and there will be things like faction missions available, little trials on the road like driving fast or jumping far and you can even replay individual missions.But what happens when you get bored of the monotony or driving around? You can buy more cars to do more driving around, though this does require vast amounts of grinding that may or probably not seem worth it. You will then decide to buy the crew credits instead through microtransactions, which... don't bother! So naturally, the best thing to do would be to replay the story. That's what I like doing, especially driving games, but naaaah!! You can't replay the story. You can only do the individual missions. Parts of what made the story a cohesive story are no longer there. What's better is that Ubisoft know their player-base would like such a feature to go through the story again in the linear fashion it was originally in but still refuse to implement it.Bottom line is that I wouldn't recommend this game because it does lose replayability. It simply becomes a cruiser after a while. Racing against other people isn't even really a big part of it. It's very rare that I get even a gimpse of racing other people. Instead, you'll have some random driver drive alongside you until they get bored.			"

Driving the cars in this game with my Logitech Driving Force GT feels so relaxing after a stressful day.Got the Complete Edition on sale. I didn't buy this game initially since there were mixed reviews about this game. But now I feel bad for not buying this game earlier. This game is so underrated. This game is so much fun while cruising with friends. There were days I played this game sacrificing my sleep. Everyday, after coming home from work I used to spend time in gaming. I didn't expect the cars to have realistic driving physics because I just wanted to drive and have fun. Isn't that gaming is all about? I love the weather cycle, different terrains, meeting different people who drive along with you, competing with other players online,etc. I don't have anything to hate about this game. And I'm definitely gonna buy the Calling All Units DLC.			"

												Issue after issue installing, crash after crash while playing. Steam says like 14 hours playing, i was able to complete the first mission and then drive around for a bit, the rest of the ""Play time"" is the time it took to install it over and over and over, trying to get it to work. Now, will not play at all, even after a clean install of windows. Worst investment ive ever made.			"

												Its not terrible. The game  itself is fun, but it is kind of a waste in a way also. Given the size of the map and extremely small amount of visible players allowed, it feels pretty much dead. It claims it is a living game, but in reality it isn't. There is nothing innovative about this game. Basically it is a prettied up version of NFSW with less visible players and a better map. It is always online, so if they decide to shut down servers, you won't even be able to play it. Other players in the game seem to keep to themselves, have yet to find a pvp match or co-op in time played and I queue for it fairly often. I bought this game on sale and still feel kind of ripped off. I'd give it a thumbs up if it was in the under 10 section, but its not.			"

												I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It's grossly plagued by A.I glitches, fantasy car data, a huge lack of selection and server instability. If you are a car person and actually know anything about cars, this game will frustrate you. The A.I in this game defies all laws of physics from letting a 1960's mustang out turn and out run a pagani huayra to magically and without warning throwing your car about 100 feet in the air on a straight stretch of empty road.None of the cars in this game perform even remotely close to their real life counterpart. Frustrating to car people, otherwise a minor detail most won't care too much about.This game has a heavy bias for American cars, and an overall fleeting selection of cars. Essentially there are only one or two cars worth getting for each category. This is not Gran Turismo or Forza, do not expect that.But worst of all is server instability. You are guaranteed, regardless of how superb your internet connection may be, to be disconnected on a regular basis during or even worse right after crossing the finish line. None of your progress will be saved and you'll be forced to do the race again. This is particularly frustrating during the long endurance races.The story is a complete joke, but that's not why we play these games. It is however worth mentioning that my most anticipated racing style 'circuit' is actually identical to 'performance' racing (racing through traffic on public roads) but done with circuit category cars. Only ONE race in the entire game is actually done on a race track. Despite there being several race tracks in this game, you only ever race in one with your circuit car. The remainder of circuit races are done on public roads identical to any performance race.There is NO end game content. You only ever need one car per category of racing (and many categories can be achieved with one car). So unless you have a burning desire to collect every car in the game, once the story line is complete there is no reason to continue playing. Even the bonus cars you can get through finding parts throughout the country are all performance wise, terrible cars (with the sole exception of the buggy).The ONLY redeeming factor for this game is the environment. It's absolutely stunning and a joy to explore in. When a race comes together and works it can be an enjoyable experience but I cannot recommend this game to anyone because it feels like a beta, that costs you 60 bucks.			"

												Great game,almost flawless for is kind. Game runs smooth at highest settings 1080-1440p with 1-4 years old hardware. Minor bugs/glitch found just 1 to tell the truth is sometimes the map while driving stop generating so you need to press the button to get back to the road to be able to continu or you will be stuck in the void. Graphics are good mostly environment is not repetitive or anything,from big cities to small towns going thru deserts,mountains,canyons,forests and even swamp. Gameplay wise if you like to drive,you will drive until your knees hurts. The only big issue in this game is...sadly...the word Ubisoft. For some people the name Ubisoft is a problem because they are not perfect and most people don't know how to update bios,drivers or have a good pc and keep it clean of stupid junk that makes them run slow. Than there's games like Watch Dogs that didn't look like the previews...well i never had issues with watch dogs and it worked fine on my hardware. My opinion might worth what all other unknown people does but mine is from an serious Adult being so... Enjoy a good arcade racing mmo open world game because there's not that many of them.			"

												I've been playing The Crew base game for a while since November and I only came upon it after the late-2015 patch which upgraded the graphics and physics of some cars.I love the game, yes.The Crew is simply the best driving-in-an-open-world game available on the PC, and the highlight of it is the virtual continental America with a great variety of enviroments for driving enjoyment. The cities in this game does not have a living-breathing feel, yet they act as huge playgrounds for driving the somewhat limited line-up of cars available in the game. I think Manhattan in The Crew is no smaller than GTA IV's Liberty City. The mountains and seasides in The Crew, however, are truly great places to get yourself lost in. The great open Americana-esque environment with ever-changing weather and time of day indeed provide a immersive experience which is hard to be found in any other driving games.This is a game made for virtual world explorers who happen to sit in a car seat and don't really care about too much about serious racing. The Crew's missions and racing can have result varying from exciting(compete in the snowy mountain road around Salt Lake City) to very boring(it totally miss the opportunity to make NYC as racing tracks interestingly). But the overall 'road trip' feel in this game is awesome.Then there's this always-online problem. I love the idea of 'Never Driving Alone' but the real experience is having the very common 'lost connection to server' headache... An offline 'Enjoy Driving Alone' will be appreciated, really.  "

												Never played such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that is so fun. If you have friends that like cars and driving around then you are in for fun. Roadtripping is amazing and will provide a joyful experience; and there sure as hell is enough map space. I've now owned this on PS4 (Lvl 50) and PC (Lvl 10) and still enjoy just driving around. This game is enhanced if you have a wheel but there is a steep learning curve in setting one up. Car customization is fun but is no Forza. I will reccomend this game simply because I find it joyous to just drive around.  Oh and btw Highway child makes a  s h i t ton of money and I suggest playing it, but you will ♥♥♥♥ing hate it quickly, god that race makes me want to end it all.Pro's:HUGE mapfun with friendsThe SummitDriftingRacetracksRace carsCustomizationRandom eventsThe carsCons: Random events The cars (How long does it take to add a damn R35?!?!?)Barricade Rocketship (You'll know what im talking about)Numerous glitches (AC Unity bad in some parts)Sometimes the map will just disappearHighway child ♥♥♥♥♥YOU MERCEDES I HIT ONE BARRIER AND NOW THE DEFACIT IS 4 MILES)EXPENSIVE♥♥♥♥♥CARS AND NOOO WAY TO GET MONEY.♥♥♥♥ this i'm just going to buy the Koenigsegg.

They're just for certain quests only I think? I never get to use them and I didn't want to. I didn't buy a bike or monster car game.-) I think putting bikes and monster cars were over work. They should've just put their foot down and work with ""the cars"" only.-) It would've been much more clear and simple if each type of tuning is embedded in one car: Your car instead of having to buy each type of cars and have to upgrade them seperately for there is a limit that your levels can do for your cars.-) Kind of forcing people to do challenges over and over for platinum gears was absurd. They should've made more efficient and better ways to get'em. You shouldn't expect people to spend such time and effort for your game.-) In some missions they give you this weird cars to do them. In the early stage you will feel burdened because you're not even adjusted to your own car and they make you ride another one. In the late stage what they will give you is just barely enough to complete the quest. They are ususally much more crappier than your cars. It's like ""What's the point of upgrading your cars? I thought I could use my upgraded car that I spent almost 3 hours for it."" It was like slap in the face.			"

												This is the first car racing game I've bought since Motorhead back in the 90s and what a great game it is. In fact, the beta got me hooked, then I waited till the complete edition went down in price and I wasn't disappointed.Some very difficult races if your car and driving aren't up to scratch and the game really brings out the competitive edge.Love tinkering with the cars and upgrading them and finally winning a race with a faster car.Online is also seamless but can take an age to get to a race.Game performance is faultless and on a GTX970/FX8320 is a solid 60 fps.Well worth the money I spent on it.

												If you’re someone who enjoys a racing game with beautiful, customisable cars, but gets bored of the usual race-to-the-finish-line gameplay, The Crew is what you’re looking for.At first glance, the game seems to lack in its graphics quality, but as you speed through the streets of the United States in over forty main missions, prove yourself in eight different skill types, and swap from all-terrain trucks to exotic sports cars to suit the occasion, you’ll quickly forget about that. And while the game is designed for multiplayer, most of it is just as suitable for single player.Underlying the beautiful gameplay of The Crew is a deep story following Alex Taylor as he joins the FBI to take vengeance on the leader of a nation-wide underground motor club named the 5-10s. As he travels from state to state, he recruits friends to help him rise through the ranks of the criminal organisation.The multiplayer game features five distinct car specifications; you’ll find yourself teaming up with friends and other online players to weave through the streets of New York in your Street car, drifting on dirt roads in your Dirt spec, racing down Route 66 in your Performance supercar, taking down rivals in your Raid truck, and hugging the racing line of designated tracks in your exotic Circuit spec.However, you’ll find that the game has its fair share of drawbacks. The first few missions, which are completed in your Street car, are quite short and hence less rewarding. Once you move onto Performance, the races will become much lengthier, allowing the pace to ramp up to frantic speeds as you narrowly dodge traffic on windy highways.The rubber-banding is also definitely lacking; if your car is too levelled up in late-game, the other AI racers will fall behind in the first stretch, and the distance will grow as the race progresses. This isn’t an issue during multiplayer, when you can focus on beating your friend – but when you’re playing alone, it often feels like more of a cruise than a race.On top of that, don’t expect the police chases to be too challenging. While this isn’t the game’s main feature, this is one aspect that could have been implemented much better. I’ve found myself too easily losing track of the cops because they can’t keep up, and this takes away from the enjoyment of having the police hot on your heels while drifting around the block.While the game can definitely be enjoyed in single player, I would recommend grabbing a few friends and hitting the roads. If none of your friends are crazy for a racing game (or, alternatively, if you have no friends…), you can join up with whoever’s online around the world to give yourself a better challenge. Either way, The Crew is a truly enjoyable game for the story-driven gamers looking for varied gameplay.			"

												It's a lot of fun, but after a while it become monotonous and rather boring. Overall there is a lot to do with faction missions, skills and story missions. Leveling is quite easy, but there is an incentive to level up as there are some nice rewards. The map is very large with a lot to do in it. Even just driving around the map is a lot of fun and takes quite a while. The downside is that you need a good and constant connection. God help you if you're at the end of an hour long race and you lose connection.			"

												i got this game due to a friend's reccomendation, and for the most part, I'm not at all disapointed.  Thisis a very fun game that you cane asily sit down and play for hours with out even realzing how much time has gone by.  This game gets 5x even better if you have a friend or two and play together.    The solo missions, while on your own, can get repetitive and dry, but when with a crew online together, the game hits a new level.  I would reccomen this to most people who enjoy live world MMO's that need a slight change of pace from the normal.			"

												When it comes to open-world racing games, this is one you'll at least want to try. The story is pretty boring and as generic as it gets, and the selection of cars seems somewhat random, but let me tell you where this game shines the brightest; the open world. Ubisoft has managed to take the entire country of The United Sattes, and shrink it down and put it into a racing game. The car customization is pretty good if you are looking to make your car the way you want. The performance tuning isn't wonderful, mainly just a ""this piece is a higher level than this one so it's better for your car"" but that being said, at least it has actual car parts to upgrade (tires, suspension, gearbox, etc.) instead of just upgrade speed or handling. But like I said early, where this game shines is in the open-world exploration. It has dynamic and chaning environments with rain and day/night cycles, a vast variety of landscapes raning from the tropical florida keys, to the big NYC, the snowy mountains of the northern rockies, the dry deserts of the southwest, and the beautiful coast line of California. And taking a large road trip in your favorite custom car and exploring the world is one of the best things I've done in a video game before.There are plenty of side activities and challenges to do, and plenty of fantastic roads to explore and drive on. If you are looking for an open-world exploration game with car customization and racing, this is the game for you.			"

												The Crew has gone through many beneficial changes from when it was first released. The Crew is an open world arcade racer that emphasizes playing with friends and car customization. The map is an abridge vesion of the United States. Major landmarks and cities appear, but smaller, lesser known places are absent from the game. Players can drive on or off the roads, and can use different car ""specs"" to traverse the land easier. These specs can be visually customized to fit the player. Performance upgrades are also available. Car selection is varied but limited. DLCs are available for more cars. The driving physics are arcade-like compared to simulation-like. Note: it is an 'always online' game.Overall, it's a ""meh"" racing game. 6.5/10Buy on sale.			"

												This game gets a bad rap and maybe some of it, deserved but I got this game during the holiday sale and I love it! The map, while obviously a heavily fictionalized version of the USA but still a huge and fun map to explore. As a long time GTA player, I unlike others like the handling of the cars in the crew. My only real complaint is the known stuttering issues, none of the fixes seem to work for me but it's not that bad in my case and something experienced in other mmos that have lag or other issues. I just think it's more noticable while driving 100 mph down the road vs wandering a fantasy realm...My only other complaints have nothing to do with the game itself but I am inclouding it none the less. YES, uplay, it still sucks and is still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It requires a key from STEAM to activate in Uplay which isn't clear to everyone and even then uplay recognises the steam version, but also initiates a second download in it's own folder so I now have the game on my pc twice, not sure if uninstalling from uplay will affect my steam version so I am leaving it alone. It also seems to think I am loading the game from an optic drive as it always asks for a disc in D drive 4x before the game launches.The game, taking this issues aside is one of the funnest driving games I have played in some time. This game should be tried and given more consideration, IMO.			"

												Don’t even bother with this game for PUBLIC PVP LOBBYS it has been destroyed by script kiddies running all sorts of cheats and as the crew has no anti cheat software included it can be a real nightmare in multiplayer public  lobbies.    BUT saying that if you enjoy single player on a huge map which is very cool indeed and hanging out with friends in Private PVP lobbies or just having fun on a huge map then yes you must get this game			"

												The game is like Need for Speed Most Wanted/Carbon, over the top, high speed, ridiculous handling. The map is HUGE, great graphics/scenery (real world places too), Car mods are cheap, but buying cars are expensive. The storyline is basic, nothing special, but the gameplay is nice, beat the game coop mode with my friend. There are only a few missions that you have to solo but those missions aren't difficult at all.			"

												I bought this game on sale for 15 euro and so far I've been having a lot of fun. There's a lot of diverse arcade racing content here. Street racing, circuit racing, rally, off road are all different enough from each other to make a fun racing experience.But the best part is probably the huge map itself. It's a scaled down version of the US and you can drive from one side to the other with no loading screens. The only negative parts I can think of are the crash physics and not enough people on the same server as you. If you like arcade racing games, go ahead and try it, it's pretty cheap for what it offers.			"

												The fun part of this game is just driving around the country. I had barely any fun doing the missions. And by barely any I mean I did nto like the missions. They suck. They're stupid. It's fun to just go around doing random stuff and finding all the points of interest. The grind to get all the parts is repetative as hell. The best way to get them is level up to max level, then start jumping off easy ramps with each kind of car until you're loaded up with platinum parts. I enjoyed the exploration until  I started that grind. On top of that some of the cars can only consistently do two or three jumps and those ramps get crowded with other players. If you really want to just drive in this game, go for it. If it sounds like a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥grind just jump ship now.			"

												Honestly, i think i have enought time in the game to write a good review. I see a lot of negetive reviews about how the DLC works, but i got the season pass on sale i knew it didnt incluse Wild Run but i think it was very well worth 12.50. The other half of bad reviews is ubisoft. Which is well deserved but i have to say they have improved a lo9t they still arent great but if you want to play this great game you have to deal with that. If you buy the game i reccomend the wild run edition because the Expansion Pack is great and completley worht it. Overall this is a great game with some slight flaws.			"

												Looking at some reviews like this guy:""I don't understand how the sale of this game isn't considered fraud. If you buy the base game, you will lose $15 and after 2 hours of playing you will be FORCED to purchase ""The Run"" expansion pack. You literally can't play anymore unless you spend more money. It's absolute horsesh**. Highway robbery. I payed for a racing game, and you didn't give me that."" I'm not even sure why you bother writing horsecap like this.. one of my friends who has the vanilla game and not ""The Run"" whatever that is, I guess you mean Wild run, the expansionpack? He has no problems playing with us who has it, and is NOT forced to buy it by the game itself.You bought a game, where you can race street cars, dritcars, raidcars etc, offroad, on circuit tracks.HOW can you say this is not a racing game? you can't? thought so.. anyhooThe game is far from perfect.. But my god its fun to just drive with your friends- Bugs like getting stuck ontop of rails, getting sucked into cars.- Very grindy if you want all cars to max level.- Insane waittime if you want to play crew vs crew in pvp.- Woodpecker song if you listen to the ingame radio (Worst problem)- Laggy pvp, as its peer-to-peer connection (alot like Call of Duty)+ A good list of cars from small cars you could tip over with your left foot, to hypercars.+ Very good customization for the cars.+ Daily income (which you increase by doing faction and pvp races)+ The world is huge and open, with lots to see and insane amounts of stuff to do.+ A endless timesink for the completionists out there, doing all the challenges, getting all the cars with all their specs to max, and so on.And for those complaining about the EXPANSION-PACK not being included in the season-pass (which is a pass to get all DLCs for that coming season) Well.. boohoo :)Would I recommend it? Well... yes, it is not a GREAT game but its a damn fun one.// Peace			"

												As someone who really enjoyed NFS Underground 2, this game felt very reminiscent, the story is good enough to at least keep playing through the campaign and the cars handle great as long as you put the time in to level them up. The map is awesome, it spans something like 110 kilometers across from Seattle to Miami and a lot of places in between, it's a lot of fun to cruise across the country with friends just exploring. The only downside is that this game is pretty pricy when you include Wild Run. Definitely check this game out when it goes on sale if you enjoy racing games that are more casual than Forza.			"

												Highly recommend this game. Sure, it has its ups and downs, but i won't list all of them for you. Although I don't exactly agree with the price, and the graphics being a bit outdated, I think that this game is great for friends to play. Its multiplayer is not as expansive as i would like it to be, though i can see reasons why this is limited. Just to list off one, gameplay. Anyways, the cars are good, although i dont like the fullstock edition of the cars. Handling is bad, grip is awful, and other things make fullstock cars undesireable. But, once you get them upgraded and even get platinum parts (not that im saying bronzes and silvers are awful parts,) the cars actually become quite good. With a good storyline, and a variation of types of cars, this makes this game quite amazing in a sense. Plus, with the freeworld driving it makes it relaxing just to drive around and cruise for awhile. One of the best mechanics I'd comment on is the police. Yes, the police. I'd almost say that its a bit of annoying on the story missions to get away from them, in freeworld, it isnt that bad.  Although the helicopter's one thing that takes away the fun of running from the cops, the escaping mechanic is well designed, and i think that the range of detection is perfect. A bit fast escape for perf and circuit spec cars, especially with a running start and a straight road.Anyways, enough of me rambling. I give The Crew™ an 8/10. Well done ubisoft.			"

Different types of races to choose from which makes it fun also!Online is really fun to play lots of different game modes to choos from like a normal race, eliminaton, hold the crown and more!CONS:You have to make a U-play account which takes time but idc.When you play on servers sometimes the players are really laggy like they teleport all over the place.

												Always remember the sheer scale of this game. It is absolutely massive, driving doesn't feel restricted in the sense of the world you are given to explore. The driving is good too, kind of arcadish, but you can really feel the weight of the cars too. The game does a great job of keeping you from feeling lonely. There are always players driving around near you, and the pvp lobbies are active. The graphical fidelity of the cars is very good, quite detailed models. The environment is lacking in comparison to other triple-A titles but once again, remember the scale of the game. There has to be some sacrifices made to allow a game of this size to run smoothly (which it does by the way, if you exclude the occasional lagger that joins into your game). Although, the environment still feels well fleshed out and with thoughtfull map design for driving. It at least gets the general shape and locations right for each place as well. Like i am from seattle, and I can tell you there is a lot left out from the city in game but I could identify it in a heartbeat.Overall, one of my favorite racing games played to date, very customizeable cars aesthetically with a large, persistent open world multiplayer racing (and dedicated pvp lobbies too). I would definitely recommend it.			"

												I don't care what the reviews say, drive 280kmh doing challenges, losing police or just enjoying the freeway! The story line is quite good, kept me hooked as far as i can say and i've completed the story and still driving around like i own everything :DThe faction missions are an awesome way to kill time, they can vary from 10 mins onwards (longest i've played is 2 hours on a faction mission THAT WAS ONE MISSION!!!!), great way to kill time and have fun.I only have ONE! or maybe two criticism that i can remember.This is an all multiplayer game so it requires an internet connection to play (and a good one at that because it can disconnect at ANY time)Not many players due to connection issues, i've read forums and stuff and they just need a dedicated server BUT DON'T LET THIS STOP YOU FROM BUYING IT BECAUSE IT IS ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!

												This game is a very good game, i still will play the game eventhough I DO  reccomend this game. Now it is fun SOMETIMES and can be exciting, but the worst part is that there are very little cars and season pass is dog poop.Also, making money in this game is quite difficult for everyone, except for platnium 1 in the league and if your higher than a gangsta. Also, they have all of their discounts for Crew Credits (CC) Which you have to pay money for.Some cars in the game are over priced by about 135,065$ or 123685.90€.Now those were the cons :).Plus you cant make your own charactor, everyone is the same. Pros-Has big map-Good Story-Nice graphics for a very big map!-You can fast travel-Not very many cheaters/modders.-The game rarely ever drops its frames-Physics are derpy（。々°）-People are nice :D-Very time consuming!-			"

												The only reason you should buy this game, and I stress this, the ONLY reason, is if you love the idea of driving around the United States of America. The map is the selling point of this game. A gigantic condensed map of the US, Driving corner to corner it a moderately quick car, enjoying the sights and the roads, will take you about 2 hours or so. The map is just so massive and diverse, and once you get out of Detroit and Chicago, it is so ridiclously pretty. I am biased as I have travelled all over the US, so I know city they are trying to show off. They have captured the essence of each city fairly well, with perhaps an exception of Detroit, New York and Chicago, which seem very dull, likely due to the lack of crime, pedestrians and traffic. Many of the other cities look and feel pretty spot on, especially approaching Las Vegas. However, this is the only positive of the game.The car selection is limited and dissapointing. They all handle horribly. To get something remotely playable, you need to greatly fine tune the handling, otherwise it is far too vague and unresponsive.The story in The Crew is so bad, it makes any Need For Speed story worthy of an Oscar in comparion.The game is a true dissapointment in every sense of the word... except for the map. Once you have the handling fine tuned to something remotely playable, and you manage to find one car of any remote interest. Once you hit the road and just drive, this game is more enjoyable than any other sandbox driving game, Forza Horizon included. Driving around the coasts, paticularly near New Orleans, Miami and over towards Texas is a sight to see. Driving through New Mexico at night or early evening/morning is unreal.			"

												The only reason you should buy this game, and I stress this, the ONLY reason, is if you love the idea of driving around the United States of America. The map is the selling point of this game. A gigantic condensed map of the US, Driving corner to corner it a moderately quick car, enjoying the sights and the roads, will take you about 2 hours or so. The map is just so massive and diverse, and once you get out of Detroit and Chicago, it is so ridiclously pretty. I am biased as I have travelled all over the US, so I know city they are trying to show off. They have captured the essence of each city fairly well, with perhaps an exception of Detroit, New York and Chicago, which seem very dull, likely due to the lack of crime, pedestrians and traffic. Many of the other cities look and feel pretty spot on, especially approaching Las Vegas. However, this is the only positive of the game.The car selection is limited and dissapointing. They all handle horribly. To get something remotely playable, you need to greatly fine tune the handling, otherwise it is far too vague and unresponsive.The story in The Crew is so bad, it makes any Need For Speed story worthy of an Oscar in comparion.The game is a true dissapointment in every sense of the word... except for the map. Once you have the handling fine tuned to something remotely playable, and you manage to find one car of any remote interest. Once you hit the road and just drive, this game is more enjoyable than any other sandbox driving game, Forza Horizon included. Driving around the coasts, paticularly near New Orleans, Miami and over towards Texas is a sight to see. Driving through New Mexico at night or early evening/morning is unreal.			"

												This game apart from what is said before is an amazing car game where you can find others and crew up or go solo.Pros:1.Good Graphics2.Variety of cars and their different driving style on the road3.Fun PvP events and tracks n modes to play4.Very beautiful world to explore on freeroam and a pretty big one as well5.Dev team is actually working on bugs and glitches and fixed a lot of issuesCons:1.High speed car impacts are designed poorly resulting in some bad feedback after collisions2.From time to time there is a loading loop in pvp events3.Vinyls and tuning is simple and doesn't let for much customization4.Can be grindy at higher levels5.Auto Transmission doesn't let you reverse gear like NFS series6.The DLC of the game is not free.

												After about 23 hours as of this review I'd say I have enough time under my belt to write a review so here it goes (If there are any spelling errors or gramatical errors, forgive me I type pretty fast and make mistakes). And yes UPLAY is needed for the CREW (some say this is bad some don't care. I'm one of those that don't care)The crew I had many speculation's about because people had said that it wasn't an MMO or very open world, and that you had to drive up on hills to find these stations that reveal the map like in assassins creed. People also said the story is very short and not interesting at all. So firstly let me make my claim over these.Is the crew an MMO?   A. No it is not, you are locked into a session of 8 people and you will never see more than that. Someone may leave the game and a new one will join in your session but that's about it. For the most part you see people here and there and maybe you drive by them or pull up and rev your engine to race, but that's it. Other than the PVP events and races you're pretty much flying solo on this one.Is the crew open world?   A. YES and in a very big way. Ever since Need for Speed hot pursuit I wanted another racing game with a very open world aspect and the CREW (for me) delivers in a big way. You start out in detroit but you can drive on down to Miami and then drive to the Grand Canyon, up to Niagra Falls and down to L.A. To me, that's pretty damn awesome. Now, is The CREW a realist representation of the USA? Yes and No, Yes they have included many major cities and landmarks as well as some famous and surrounding towns but for the most part it's highways and open roads. But they have done well to add in many other key things in between such as marshes down in Miami, many farmlands in the Midwest. And a lot of the forestry seen is pretty on par with what would be in the surrounding terrain. So is it a 100% accurate rendition of the US? No, because otherwise you'd spend days to just drive down to Miami. But is it a big open world that is like the US and offers a lot of Free Driving fun? Yes, in a BIG way.Do you reveal the map with Viewpoints like in AC?    A. Kind of, you have data stations which detail monuments and skill mini games found on the roads, that's pretty much it. Where the revealing of the map comes into play is when you drive on a road or in an area it starts to reveal the map where you drove. The only other kind of ""Drive and find this"" is the hidden car parts for hot rod's and that's about it.Is the story bad?    A. In my opinion it's OK, it feels like Ubisoft was going for a Fast and the Furious kind of story in a sense. But the bulk of the story is cutscenes and using races to solve issues which makes the story kind of boring here and there. But I do keep guessing as to how the story will play out so it's kept my attention at least. Now I'll detail Pro's and Con's of the crewPro's-Open world-A fair selection of cars to choose from-Lots of customization for your cars-Driving and racing is fun-Driving controls are good (I use an xbox360 controller)-Many different car customization options for off road, racing, street racing, circuit racing, etc.-For a racing game it doesn't look bad, you generally focus on the roads and your car (cars look like they are a high texture though) so texture quality isn't a huge biggy, up close you can see the lower textures but like I said, you're driving and racing in 3rd person so it's not an issue.Con's-Not an MMO, an 8 player session is not an MMO, I'd prefer if anything a 32 player session or maybe 50. I think an MMO style with hundreds of people racing could become hectic.-Framrate dips in big cities with lots to load. I'm running a GTX 980 Ti and see frame rates of 20-30 FPS in larger cities, all other times I usually got around 40-50's even in forests.-Even more customization options would be good-Microtransactions to buy more money and ""CREW credits."" You don't have to do this and can easily earn your money by just playing but this micro transaction method in gaming really needs to stop. You can also pay $3(I think) for some other vehicles that can only be bought with your real money but they aren't anything special luckily.-No custom music options in-game, this is something I really wish they put it. No idea why they can't. It's not a huge issue because I can just run it in borderless windowed and run a playlist of my own stuff on the side but it's still a minor inconvenience.Overal I'd give the crew maybe a 7.5/10. It's fun and a really awesome open world driving game, I just wish more people could be in a session and framerate dips in larger cities weren't a thing.			"

												Honest Review (Spoilers might included):This is the first time I play a game made by Ubisoft. I enjoy this game a lot (since I can explore the USA). And I don't care if the game have to launch Uplay, it's their game anyway. Let's start.It's true some (or most) of the missions usually have a same kind of objective, I don't deny it and it's kinda boring. But hey, I'm not rating the game only from the missions they provided to us. The driving style kinda nice, but not too good, it's not way too simulatoristic, but also not too arcadish. For the perfomance part, you might want to farm it a bit since it's kinda hard to get a good parts. The physics, yesss, I also notice that, the glitches and stuffs, but I found that funny to derp around. And no, the game not way too glitchy, don't worry.The playground also HUGE, they cut a few parts of USA though, but whatever, it's BIG ! The map have a lot of activities to do, mostly just the same type of skills run, like speeds, precision. Don't worry about going from place to place, they got Fast Travel (After you explore the area first of course).The AI catchup system might be the annoying part of the game, but that also keep me awake for the entire races, making the races not boring. Depend on how you see it in the end.The cars, they don't have too much of it, but still have a nice modification, even though we can't freely modify the vinyl and the size of wings, etc etc~, but it's still nice to me. You don't have to go to your garage everytime you want to change your car, just a few buttons tap and voila! You use another car!Pros:- A large playground for you to play.- You learn how to activate product on Ubisoft.- Buy this game when on Sale!- A new photo mode when freedrive!- A Sexy nerdy girl, why not!- Wild run expansion might be needed for more fun (Monster Truck! but you can't run over civ's car with it, only for stunts like flips and 360).- You can have up to 4 person (include you) in a crew.- Canadian border works!Cons:- Need to farm to get a good perfomance part and money.- AI catchup might be annoying if you can't handle it too well.- Overpriced Cars even though they look cheap.- Too bad you can't save your race in the middle of it. if you tend to lose connection, I suggest don't buy since this game required a full internet connection.- Most story missions contain same kind of objective that might make players bored.I'll add more stuff to this review later.I rate it 7.9/10Cheers!

												The Crew has made me question whether anything new can be added to the racing genre. Games like Gran Turismo and Burnout seem to have cornered the market in terms of innovation merely because they got there first and racing games are typically as bare bones as games go. The Crew attempts to add new features but falls short and instead you get another brown, typical racing game. Does this make it bad? No. Is it good? No. The Crew is simply here and yet theres something about driving across country in cars you can only dream of owning that adds a sense of awe and scale to an otherwise generic game.Essentially The Crew is the first racing MMO. The idea is superb, you and everyone playing are there, competing, racing, doing challenges and exploring the entire US mainland in real time but unfortunatly falls and fails nearly everywhere. PVP has no matchmaking and is simply you VS anyone who joins that particular lobby. So someone driving a level 1200 Aston Martin can compete against someone driving a level 300 Mini Cooper and you wont know who is driving what until the event is locked in and about to begin when everyone picks their car. Lastly is the ""expansion"" and I use this term loosly, called Wild Run. This adds several new Specs that largely cant be used outside of the ""summit"" which is the largely competitive monthly meet that you must qualify for weeks before hand by partaking in stunts or freedrive challenges. Now, I have no Idea what freechallenges are, no body ever accepts my challenge invites and I never get invited, so I simply have no idea what it even is.All in all, The Crew, like most recent Ubisoft games, comes across with vast ammounts of potential but never lives up to any of it. Its here, doing what it does. It looks pretty at least.  "

												The sense of speed is spot on in this game. And that, for me, is a huge factor in how well I enjoy a racing game. If I'm going 100mph I want it too look and feel like I'm going that fast. The graphics, while impressive at times, do suffer from a slightly low-fi look at times. I imagine this is because of the sheer size of the world. Your car will always be in the spotlight and will always look the best, however. So don't worry about that. I can forgive slightly muddy textures in the environment as long as my car and all of my customization looks good.			"

												Lots of people are complaining about bugs, crashes, Ubisoft sucking♥♥♥♥♥and not helping the game in any way except releasing more DLC. But if you can look past all that you get a really quite fun open world driving game, where you can drive all over America. There are a fair bit of cars, nowhere near how many most people would like, but enough to keep you busy. There is the problem with that if you want the best cars to be max level (1299) you will have to do a good amount of grinding if you want it fast. The Crew would be a lot better if Ubisoft didn't sit around sucking its own♥♥♥♥♥♥all day and actually fixed the problems in a timely manner, but none the less its a fun game. I'd reccomend getting it on sale, and trying the demo first.			"

I'm sure the dlc coming out later this year will make it slightly more awesome, but the co-op playing is quite enjoyable. Some missions are very difficult though, and it's much much easier with someone to help that's more experienced. The music is lacking, too much Mozart.

												I've played 11 hours so far using a G27 wheel. I must say it's very fun to cruise and go for a challenge from time to time.The fact that you can join a faction is cool as well. This gives you the chance to take on bigger missions (they vary from a few minutes to over an hour)I do think the grinding for better parts can be a bit one sided though.But nevertheless, it's great fun.

												One of my favorite racing games, has a big map and the devs are always listening to comments and always are working in the game making it even better I love the classes they have: street, dirt, Perf ( my second favorite class) Raid ( my favorite class) and like a nasscar type. So much fun if recommend this to any racing fans. PINKIE PIE APROVES			"

So I searched through forums on how to fix it and I saw a guy say: activate ur game on uplay, which I did and that was it.. So i think i will just refund It and buy it again..			"

												I know this game gets a little bit of hate but honestly, i think it's worth a buy if you're into racing games or a driving sim kind of games. 1st off, the map is huge. If you drive at maximum speed, you can possibly make it from new york to los angeles in 55 mins. If you drive the normal speed limit, expect a good 4-5 hour car journey. There is a lot to see and explore and visit, you really aren't limited as to where you can go. If you want to drive through a forrest in the middle of nowhere, you can do that. If you want to get lost in the desert, you can do that, if you want to slide down ski slopes on high mountains, you can do that. You can't get out your car which is a down side but it is a car game so that's expected. I personally love this game. I may not have many hours on it but i will eventually when i get around to playing it a lot.			"

												I brought and downloaded ""the crew"" from Steam yesterday. Everything is installed correctly and the Uplay is connected. But there is nothing happened when I click the ""start"" button, no error report. A few second later, the Uplay jumps out and tells me ""Thank you for playing the crew"". S o I open up the task manager and do it again. I observed that ""the crew"" process starts when I click the ""start"" button. But after a few second, ""the crew"" process suddenly disappears and the Uplay comes out again to tell me ""Thank you for playing the crew"". it seems that the game already shuts down before it can start. I deleted and re-downloaded it today but the problem is still there. "

												The Crew has it issues like sudden crashes (but that’s expected being a UBISOFT PC game) but even then they don't happen often, but what really bugs me is how you can be free driving and all of a sudden you run through a mini-game challenge, sometimes you can simply swerve out of the way but on small road with guard rails it’s impossible not to go through them, you then have to click ESC and abort it which completely ruins the experience. Now they can be helpful for gaining parts and XP but it would be nice if you could avoid them. I think my only other big issue in this game is if you get in close proximity to an item (im guessing a collectible to get the hidden car) the radar starts this infernal bleeping noise that will not stop unless you drive away. I also have some smaller issues with the gameplay being that although they saved us from tailing and time missions in ACU they just couldn’t help adding some off road tailing and takedown missions which I might add are really hard to do due to the weird off road physics that if you go over a bump your truck goes vertical and when it lands it swerves. Also I know it’s a racing game but I can’t help but feel they could have put a bit more diversity in the missions. Some good points are for the most parts the physics are good, the driving is also very responsive and it feels good to take turns and show off, the graphics are stunning, the car selection is decent and the joy I receive from just driving around and exploring the huge map really makes the game for me. And although there are micro-transactions thankfully they are not vital to completing the game. Last thing I’ll say is that you don’t have to join an online crew with real people or play the missions with other players, it can be played completely single player, I’m sure this is well known but at the time I purchased the game I didn’t know and the information would have been helpful in my decision. So I think at the core like all UBISOFT games it’s a really good game and defiantly worth paying, especially if you’re into open world racing.			"

												Honestly I really think more people need to appreciate this game for what it is. Everyone's always so caught up in what games have better graphics/framerate/etc. From what I gather, neither of those things are Ivory Tower's goal. What they truly HAVE accomplished with The Crew is successfully piecing together an enjoyable game with nice cars and a gigantic map. And aside from that, they're still supporting the game a whole year after release with new cars, handling improvements, and now an entire graphical overhaul. It's clear that the developers are making their best effort to succeed in all categories. In my unpopular opinion, that's what matters the most.			"

												This is the perfect game if you have children who like cars. As an open world-free roaming-drive anywhere you want driving game, The Crew is perfectly suited for him. I just gave him ""the red car"", he turned it into a monster truck and he's good to go. I'm 45 hours into the game and I'm not even half way through the story. But, that is not why I got the game.If, like me, you are looking for an open world driving game without the ability to run pedestrians over that kids could play easily then this is the game for you. It is multiplayer however, but that you can turn off the chat. I haven't had a problem with bonehead other drivers so far. Recommended.			"

Overall if you want a racing game that isnt a simulator game, you cant go wrong with this. If you can get the complete edition for under $45 go for it. Game is worth about $25, Expansion is worth about $15, and the season pass is barely worth $10. ( The season pass only contains cars. The base game has all the goodies except the special events, classes, and motorcyles that come in the expansion.) "

												Here's everything I wish people would've told me about this game while I debated buying it, summarized from most to least important:-From a complete simulator geek obsessed with race sims, on hardcore mode with a Logitech G27, the physics lean much more towards simcade than arcade. In fact, the physics remind me a lot of Gran Turismo 4, with much better low speed differential physics (aka you can actually do a proper donut)-The vehicle upgrades can be used to vastly impact vehicle handling, and if the car feels unrealistic, swapping around differential parts and tires makes a huge difference, and can make an upgraded car that feels arcade-y, to VERY sim feeling.-If you own a Logitech G27 and you don't own this game, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?-It's the TRUE spiritual successor to Test Drive Unlimited, and you should forget TDU2 ever existed.-While the graphics resembles TDU2 (same lead environment artist, who is now employed by Rockstar) NOTHING ELSE DOES, SO FEAR NOT, that POS game can be forgotten and/or nuked into eternity.-The developers who created this game LOVED it, and it shows.Tips: -If you have a low end processor, turn geometry settings down. The visual impact is minimal (a little more pop in) and it will vastly boost your FPS-If you have a low end GPU, turn Ambient Occlusion to SSAO or off.-If you love race sims, have a wheel, you NEED to buy this game.

												A really fun driving game that is very realistic.  There are so many cool cars that you can drive and make diifferent varients of.  Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid, and Circuit cars allow you to do so many amazing missions.  Never drive alone...  Play with friends to pass tough missions and overall pass the time away.			"

												The only reason to not like this game is if you don't want to do online races for better parts or if you like drifting, because in this game drifting isn't exactly something you can do every second and every turn. But if that doesn't bother you, I think you should buy dis game right here. it good ya.			"

												I honestly don't understand the rage here. There are problems sure, but you're not going to find anything close to this game for PC, period. I'd describe it as Euro Truck Simulator meets NFS Undercover (older version, not the remake junk).THE BADThe ""crewpoints"" or whatever they are system. Yeah the publishers have hopped onto the in-game purchase bandwagon, and I don't agree with this nickle-and-dime system outside of free Appstore games,  but it's not implemented in an annoying or necessary-to-play kind of way. I'm only 18 hrs into the game and have some junk car I started out with (sorry Ford), an upgraded mid-range car, and a beautiful Italian supercar I take out on special occasions. They even give you 100k credits after an early mission, more than enough to get you started.  I haven't touched the credit system beyond that, but even if I wanted to, it would be a few bucks for a new car and some random customization. Considering I got the game for 30-35 bucks, a fiver added onto that one time isn't really a huge problem.This always-online crap is the future, and it sucks. But I haven't had connectivity problems, so I can tolerate it. The community isn't huge, so PVP games aren't easy to come by in my 18 hour experience, but I enjoy playing the missions and just crusing around, exploring. And you'll always find someone running from the police or available to ram into (sorry, I do it with love). That said, impromptu street races and roadtrips would be pretty sweet, but maybe I just need more friends...THE GOODThe map! The open-world! Way too much to explore! While it's not totally accurate and all-encompassing, the ability to drive around major cities in most every region of the US (Alaska and Hawaii, sorry bros) is something I've dreamed of ever since I got into driving games. And it's implemented perfectly here. Plenty of roads to take across the US, varying in driving complexity and scenery, and I never feel as though I'm trapped or limited by a wall. The exception would be the actual wall seperating Mexico and Texas. Bush wasn't kidding.The graphics are fantastic. A friend jokes that it doesn't take much for racing games to look good, and while true, the scenery is a joy to look at. They even have a ""photo mode"" because they know we're snapping screenshots. Even on my paltry Macbook Pro settings, I really enjoy looking at the game. The handling is perfect for an arcade racer, which is what this is. I play serious racing sims but can also suspend my pretentious ways to enjoy games like this and NFS. If only Just Cause 3 borrowed these phyiscs...THE MEDIOCRERubberbanding is annoying and while this game isn't horrible with it, if your car is underpowered for a race and you make one mistake, you're restarting. Even missions where you're supplied the car, no matter the lead you have, one or two mistakes in this case can cost the 5-minute race. I've got a mission in the latter that I cannot beat, even 18 hours into the game, and it's holding me back from new missions down that path.There aren't enough missions. This is an ""MMORPG"" (MMORG?). I don't mind grinding a bit to earn money/levels. But I worry I may eventually run out of ways to advance. There are events, and challenges while driving, but that may not be enough to sustain constant advancement. I'd even settle for ""collect the tires on the racetrack"" type stuff.I love cars and customization, but there just isn't enough here. While I was able to get the two main cars I shoot for every racing game, I'd love to see more older vehicles and some of the newer supercars (why no Veyron?). I mean, why is there an Escalade and a Hummer? This isn't Cruisin USA. Give me more Ferraris, a Countach, and Porches (come on, RUF??) The visual customization is pretty bare. There are quite a few colors and they allow you to customize all of the typical areas of the car, but the choices aren't enough, and aren't significant in differences. I've got to frequently switch back and forth between parts to spot the difference. But honestly, even if I were running around in a Ford Pinto, I'd have fun exploring the map.TLDRAll said, this is a solid arcade racer, enough cars and customization to enjoy the experience (though I'd like more), beautiful scenery and graphics, but most of all: THE FANTASTIC, FREE-ROAM MAP OF EVERY REGION IN THE CONTINENTIAL US. If that sounds good, buy the game. As of current, make sure you get the Wild Ride or whatever version. It comes with the original game and the expansion. "

												Why do I reccomend this game? It's not the cars, the driving, or story. It's the atmophere. The whole game is breathing, it's full of activity, people, cars, and even planes and helicopters. People can be seen jogging in hot climates, people in the snow wear jackets, some even have conversations. Cities are full of cars, with not so bad AI too! Planes are the biggest part in my opinion. If you see a farm a cropduster will occasionally fly over. Helicopters buzz about like ants, some tiny and some small. Planes can land and take off from airports. (Which you can actually go to and use) They all have their own sounds and lights. If you like taking in the scenery, I would reccomend this game.			"

												Do I recomend this game? Yes, and no.The story is boring and repetitive. The AI is way too easy, you win every race with minimal effort. You complete some section, then you move on to another section, where you do the same thing, with a different tuner. The difficulty doesnt go up. You move to a different place, you get another character you dont care about, everybody tries to look fierce, blah blah blah blah blah.  The police are too easy, and too hard at the same time. If they get you trapped for 3 seconds, even though you are clearly getting un-trapped, you get arrested. But if they didnt trap you, they barely stay on you. Seriously, it is way too easy to lose them.But the multiplayer makes up for the terrible story. The summit events are always extremly fun, to try to get to silver and gold. The multiplayer races are extremly fun, but get boring fast, when you are playing the same maps. There isnt much different maps. The side missions are also a blast. Freedriver stunts, crew missions, and something else, i cant remeber the name of it xD. This is just kinda a freetime game. This game gets very stale, very fast. Beware.			"

												Ever since Hot Wheels for the Nintendo DS was a thing, I've been playing racing games. But I always wanted more than the invisible wall boundaries and randomly placed cement walls that told me I couldn't go here or there. And then there was Need for Speed Carbon and so on, and I was a happy boy. But, 2 years ago, I saw a trailer for this upcoming game, The Crew. I was blown away! Finally, a game were you could get to explore America in your car, not some stock here-we'll-only-give-you-colors-as-customization-options cars *cough cough* Need for Speed Rivals. But instead, a car that you'd most likely never see anyone else driving. Out of my entire garage, I have never seen someone with the exact same wheels, bumpers, exhaust, interior, vinyls, and so on. And the graphics, long story short, I have never had a harder♥♥♥♥♥♥ But hey, if you're not hard while driving, you probably like men. Of course, running this game in ultra while still getting 60 FPS in dowtown New York comes at a price, which is needing to have a monster of a PC. Your mom's laptop from the office won't run this without burning itslef alive. Overall a great game, and my favorite racing game yet.			"

												If I could give this game a totally mixed review, I would. I have therefore decided to recommend this game, but only when it's on sale half price, like when I got it.In my experience, the story is forgettable, the missions can get repetitive (and often very difficult) and the 'RPG elements' including car upgrades are severely lacking. I would have loved to see actual individual upgrade purchases, like in the forza games, rather than meaningless stats. I completed the story missions in around 20 hours, playing entirely single player (the game includes worryingly few other players btw), which is feel is a more than acceptable gameplay time.  The thing that redeems the game though (mostly) is the map and the cars... Firstly, i'll talk about the map. Ignore all of the criticism of it being too small, or not very detailed, its amazing. There are enough areas to carry on exploring after the story is completed and driving around is very fun on its own! If free roaming is your thing, then you will love this. The cars, as i've mentioned before, have limited customization when it comes to performance, which is a shame. HOWEVER, you can customize the looks of your cars, from decals, to alloys, to bumpers as much as you want. Also, you can customize a car for each spec you have it tuned to, so effectivley having multiple versions of each car! You can build your favourite cars and then use the in-game photography mode (which is very in-depth) to take pictures wherever you want, with filters, lighting, weather effects etc. This part of the game, however small, can eat up hours if you like getting the perfect screenshot!Overall, this game is somewhat disappointing, when you consider the marketing and what it claims to be.. a driving MMO! If you want a simulation game, or something with hardcore racing, it's definatley not for you. If however, you are a fan of more 'arcadey' racing games, or just want something different to play, I would give it a try. I wouldn't however say it's worth the full price, especially when its plagued with DLC and microtransactions!			"

Don't expect the ""full US"" though, its been shrunken down to major landmarks and cities.

												The Crew in my opinion is the best racing game on the market. The freedom to make up your own fun is one of the best things about the game as you can either play all of the story missions and pve missions or pvp racing. The pve missions have a good selection to play from for all the car specs to earn in game money and rep and some upgrades for your cars and with the addition of the crew wild run awhile ago there is alot more to do and extra cars and specs to have a play around with. With any racing game you find the usual group of racers who either drive dirty but you can easily avoid them but 90% of the time you find all kinds of drivers who are clean drivers and you have fun with as you race or cruise around.The crew is a great game with a race wheel for the people have one or are thinking to get one and a normal controller works great to.

												I gave it a positive, because it IS a fun game. I have even played most of the game solo and it has been a fun experience. However, that being said the amount of cars that you can buy with in game credits is disapointingly small. Most of the good cars you have to buy with real $. When you spend a good amount of $ on the game then more on the Wild Rund dlc, (without the Wild Run, the game would not be fun imo) its a huge letdown that they make you spend so much more on extra cars. If here was a bigger selection of cars inclused with the games I would not have any agrument, but that is not so.  I have not paid any extra for cars and it still has been fun, thus the thumbs up. But if i was to rate it 1-10 I would have to give it a 6 because of the cars issue. If you can get the game plus Wild Run for a good price, I recomend it. If not pass it up or wait untill you can.

												loved it for a few days, then it stopped working. Ubisoft... ♥♥♥♥ing fix this if you don't want to lose customersUPDATEsolution found: http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1302898-The-Crew-has-stopped-working/page3Actual Review: Now that I've played this game for 100+ hours i think i can make a good judgement. Overall i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, It's a great game to play with your friends from taking a roadtrip across America to going through a adrenaline filled hot pursuit *NEW GADGETS AVALIABLE FOR POLICE CHASES* at high speeds. Although I wish it had steam achievements it doessn't which to be honest is usually a turn off when buying games because I'm an absolute achievement hunter. This game has a special feel to it compared to other racing games. The detailed environment gives you an extra sense of being there and the amazing diversity of cars makes you feel like the richest racer in the world. Although Ubisoft (as usual) is begging for money with the DLCs being extremely overpriced although they are still extremely fun and add crazy amounts of new content such as a whole new mini story (in ways) with the new Calling All Units DLC. Pros: -Great Graphics-Diverse veichle choice and customizability-Huge amounts of free roam-There is an incredible amount of things to do in this game with over 100 hours i havent even completed 30%-Constant online championships-Reasonable price for the game-my friend said its better than forza horison 3 (i dont believe him tho)-probably lots more i can't think ofCons:-Need a really good computer-DLCs are overpriced-the gravity stops you from doing barrel rolls-if you don't get the CAU DLC zoe tells you to get an unlockable car every 5 minutes-probably lots of other things i can't thing of right now			"

												This game is kinda good only if you don't do story and didn't set controls to hardest ones without having a racing wheel.(since several cars suck at handling too much...) Buy it only on discounts!(since it costs too much...)Main review part:Graphics: Good but they eat too much so i have to play on medium to not to lag @10 fps :x (8/10)Gameplay: It's kinda good, but some moments are too bad (when you have to rekt someone for example)(7/10)Controls: Menu navigation sux, car handling: okay, but not realistic(ice+any OP car=powersliding 24/7, but if we go ""nub mode"" and set full assist, we don't powerslide -.-) (5/10)Story: Good for NFS, not good for everything else xD at least no unethical♥♥♥♥♥♥so its okay... (6/10)Setting: 1:50(i think) scale USA is kinda cool, and a lot of cars to choose... (10/10)End-Game playability: Best part of this game is endgame cuz you have much todos and PvP, but.. that means grinding which is not good in racing kind of games...(parts for example) (7/10)Overall rating: Game is kinda decent, but overpriced and you must rush thru story to get to interesting part... Btw there is some other alternative to it which is much betr, but has no nfs stuff, its Test Drive Unlimited 2... kinda decent time waster, so try it out too! (much cheaper. but those edays dev support is almost nothing :c)Rank: B (7,1/10)			"

												It's everything I've ever wanted in a modern racing game. Except for the uPlay part. No one wants that in any game.Racing mechanics aren't bad as everyone keeps making it out to be. Best recommended for past fans of games like Need for Speed. And hell, it's not an MMO, guys. I keep playing it as a singleplayer open-world racer with optional co-op and an always-online requirement, which is honestly what it has always been.Good for the game, bad for the Ubi.9/10.			"

Handles like the old NFS:Most Wanted or something of the sorts. Yes, there are microtransactions, but you can easily manage without this, and the story's pretty fun as well. I highly recommend this game if you like racing games with an arcade-y feel to it.			"

												Good for those who buy gta just to drive around. All cars are licensed so no soft body physics on any cars. Optimized well for pc. Boring story, great sound design. The scans of the roads and cars are pretty accurate. I suggest buying only on sale.   Only bug I've experienced is outrunning the speed at which the map loads and getting stuck in a void till refreshed.EDIT: After a hotfix, I am missing a file that I cannot reinstall. I've tried reinstalling the game as a whole and using the redist package. Game is unplayable now.Edit:After a week or so with support the game is playable.			"

												I'll start off by saying this game is a lot of fun, by yourself or playing with friends. The handling is very arcadey, but still has a good balance between grip and sliding. The physics are really bad. Like really bad. But that isn't a game killer. It just looks kinda funky when your car gets launched into the air. Customization is limited and there really aren't a lot of cars to choose from. It seems like there is about 25. Which in an open world car game there won't really be anything that makes you a unique driver compared to everyone else in your world. Which is a disappointment. No 'forza style' painting on your car, you just select preset liveries and thats that...But is it fun? Hell ya. The soundtrack is pretty damn good. Not on par with the lights of forza horizon bass arena, but still good. Is it worth $40?? (you have to get wild run dlc for this game to be any decent at all) Probably not. It only takes 20 hours to finish the single player and reach level cap.. that's $2 an hour in a massive game that could easily been designed for 100+ hours of story driven gameplay. The missions are repetitive and cheesy. The dialogue is insanely cheesy, although acted very well. SHOULD YOU BUY? No. unless its $20 for wild run dlc and full game. WOULD I RECOMMEND? Yes. It is fun, but lacks content to really be a stellar game. 7.5/10			"

												The singleplayer aspect of this game is a bit boring. The story seems rushed. However, just like the trailer, I feel like this game is not meant to be played alone and is meant to be played in a crew. The people I've met in PvP events are by far one of the friendliest community in a video game. Just cruising with high end cars from New York City to Los Angeles just talking to the people online makes this game so enjoyable. As for cars, I like the variety. Although it is not close to the amount of cars in say Gran Turismo or Forza, just upgrading a mustang into a Monster spec is so satisfying. You could also win DLC vehicles from special events, which gives an incentive to play more. Furthermore, they keep updating and releasing more specs for cars. This is by far not the best game I've played; however, it is my favorite racing game.			"

												""It requires steam to open the uplay, and requires uplay to play the game. Buying the gold edition but uplay says it TRIAL VERSION. Con-Fusion!!"" 10/10Do you recommend this game? YES and NOIf you're looking something fun or more like ""forza-horizon""-ish thing, cruising all over the town, love open-world settings, love modifying cars, had a gamepad/steering wheel, arcade driving and then YES. But if you're something more like sim-driving, great physics of a car, beautiful graphics, avoiding tech-issues, not buying the gold edition, massive online player and then NO. But it's a bit worth it when you bought on 50% sale, not in full price.			"

												Pros: very big map, nice graphic at lowest setting, smart loot enable to get better part at lower level race, nice cutscene, nice story line, nice kits for car, nice scenery and detail at background.Cons: smart loot give me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part which is much worse (eg. +2 performance) compare to gold (eg. +20 performance) on the event with a car with stock or low level part on the slot. worst game inefficient game processing low fps everytime only get 60 fps at the last moment of the race. crown race is so boring and annoying. game always crash or lag the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of my pc I7 with GT755 SLI. nfs rival look and played much better with high setting at 60 fps. everytime pvp the map never be the same so my pc need to load the new map which take like the whole race with 10 fps is the worse even with a max performance car. experience time lag when my pc lag (eg. game time is slower than real time. drive on a straight path still lose to a much lower performance car with no lag)What can the developer do : make the game run smoother or require lesser pc performance etc. smart loot will give the gold part of the event if the part on the car is lower performaance than the gold part.

												This game really defines ""Open World"" arcade racing games but was executed poorly. The massive game world set in United State really is beautiful and scenic but the gameplay is mediocre at best. It's fun for a day or two when exploring the game world but the gameplay is bland after you had experienced enough. Nevertheless, I cannot recommend this game for those who are fans of racing games but if you want to experience something different from the normal racing games set in a small arena, Then this is for you TL;DR Game world is massive and beautifulGameplay is mediocreRecommended playing with friends Hype is dangerous			"

												The game is fun, don't get me wrong, but it has its drawbacks. The costumization is great, the cars are sweet, and the variety is great. I've never played a racing game that has a Ferrari 458, and a 2010 Chevy SIlverado. The map is awsome. Instead of being stuck in one city, you can cross the entire U.S. The cities aren't perfect, or even close for that matter, but if you play the game in the right mind set, where nothing is perfect, you'll have fun. I enjoy the game, it's not the best game, but its good. It's an arcade driving game, not a simulation racing like Forza or Assetto Corsa.			"

The map of the U.S. is awesome.  You can go ANYWHERE on the map.  You can drive up the side of a mountain and overlook big cities such as LA and NYC.  The atmosphere of the game leaves you with a nice comfy feel.  Nothing beats driving across the U.S. in your favorite cars with your buddies.  All the cars are fun to drive and feature many details.  There are some bugs with AI traffic and some technical difficulties with Ubi's garbage network 'features'.  Overall would recommend.  8/10			"

												Awesome game.  Thats all I have to say.I was debating buying it recently, however when it went on sale for 50% off, I decided to purchase gold edition because of the bonus items/features it came with.  As soon as I opened the game, I knew I would enjoy it because of its beautiful graphics and sweet soundtrack.  The story line also makes it even more enjoyable, and the fact that you can play it online with others if you want.  The map is massive, which also adds to the enjoyment of even just driving around with no reason.Yes, there are a few flaws to the game, however they have not negatively affected my personal experience playing it.I can guarantee the dedication of many, many more hours to the game.9/10			"

												It's a great game with lots and lots of space to play with (literally), with a really clichee based story and a really bad syncronisation in my language (german).The game itsself isnt a mmo, but the way you get addicted is the mmo way.The graphics arent the best compared to other next gen games, but much better than last-gen.When you drive for the first time, it feels very unresponsive, but if you found the best settings for the controller (+hardcore mode), you can really shoot away from many other more powerful cars (only on a circuit).Im impressed by the size and the detail of the map, I never got bored by the landscapes, unlike NFS Rivals.

												Fun open-world racing game with a lot of potential 9/10, the only problem i have when playing with other players is starting  about 20 seconds behind other players and my car being slower than all other player cars (my level 61 Charger was passed by a level 21 Charger at about the 4th checkpoint and then won and beat me by 30 seconds in a 10 checkpoint race?!? P.S. i didn't hit anything harder than a slight bump that threw me off course for half a second) single-player works very well though			"

												Game is really fun. If you like arcade racing games it is a must have.Pros:-The way the car drives is pretty customizable and even though you can't make huge changes like making it a sim, you can definitely make it drive to your taste (as long as you enjoy arcade driving).-Game creates the perfect challange. You can win most races with relative ease, but getting that gold medal definitely requires some skill.-People have been bashing the graphics, but for an online-focused open world racing game the graphics are really impressive.-Online experience seems pretty stable. One problem I always have with online racing games is how crazy things go when playing online, cars popping out of nowhere, suddenly stoping or accelarating, etc. So far I have experienced no major problems while playing coop events.-Variety of car classes and events for those classes. There are car classes build for different terrains and conditions and events for those different classes.-Don't like playing with other people? You can go completely solo. Even though the game is online-focused you can ignore everyone around you and play it like if it was a singleplayer game.-Even though it's an arcade game you can feel the differences in handling of each vehicle with ease, making car choices come to preference.-That huge map! Travelling from one city to another is already a lot of fun and there are kind of mini-games in every road that include jumping, slaloms, driving fast and on the road, etc. All to keep you busy on your travels while also rewarding you.-The performance is flawless. Some people may be worried about performance since it's a Ubisoft game, but I have a pretty old computer and can still run the game flawlessly with mixed high/ultra settings.Neutral:-There are not many visual customization options as I though there would be, but customizing your car is still pretty fun, even though I feel it could be better.-Soundtrack doesn't fit the game well. The songs don't give you that adrenaline that make you want to drive fast and recklessly. But I believe no one cares for game soundtracks anymore, since most people just mute the game music and use an external music player.-The story feels kinda dull. The story is amazing the first minutes of gameplay, but once you hit the road it doesn't feel like a big deal anymore, but all online-focused games are like this. I haven't completed the game yet, so take this one with a grain of salt.-Cops are lazy. You have to do some real♥♥♥♥♥♥for them to go after you, just driving a clearly illegaly modified car 100Km/h above speed limit won't do it. Some people will love it, some others will hate it. Sometimes they also appear during races and don't do anything. In events where they're the main deal it's a different story, of course.Cons:-The car sounds are pretty bad, they just don't sound reallistic. Sometimes I feel like hearing an engine that came from a 2005 game.-You win performance parts in every event, which completely makes the performance shop useless allowing you to make a lot of money very easily since you have to spend very little of it to progress through the game. Remember that I haven't completed the game yet, it may change at some point.-You can't play the game offline, as far as I know. People who don't have access to a decent connection all the time must be very careful when buying this game.Some people have been saying this game is horrible, it is not. I haven't experienced bugs, lags, freezes, ctds or anything like that. The game is just great, even though it's not amazing. It's a great game that will give you a lot of fun specially if you play with your friends, but there's nothing really groundbraking about it.Also, don't pay attention to those people saying that the game's handling and physics are horrible. It's an arcade game and it was designed to be so, so don't expect reallistic collisions, steering, car damage or anything like that. It has very good mechanics for an arcade game. It's not just an ""accelerate and steer game"" and you can still make mistakes in it, considering that you're playing on hardcore mode.I give this game a solid 7.8/10If you have any doubts if you should or should not buy the game, feel free to ask me any questions ; )			"

												Well I will keep it short and sweet. This game is hands down a lot of fun. When I say fun I mean sit on my♥♥♥♥♥until it starts to sting and hurt because the cushions on my chair are so worn. NOW THATS FUN...Anyways, This game is a HUGE open world. Anyone complaining its not to scale or a exact copy of google maps or something can go shove it. The graphics are great and with the MMO structure there is endless room for improvement with later content patches.. even to the very items and cars of the game to gamemodes. and for a Ubisoft title on PC the launch did very well haha.I have no problem finding 2 or 3 players to do a few missions with. I have already made a few friends in game. The gameplay is simple yet extremely satisfying. You complete missions and get essentially ""loot"" from doing it and level up. There are also random missions along the roads and paths that give you parts and upgrades.Also there is tiers of levels and factions for end game. I mean this game is huuge and for 60 bucks its totally worth it to me. I mean its the most fun ive had on a game in a while.. I mean it had me out of my chair screaming over voice chat with 2 other guys after 4 trys on the same hard mission for the gold and then we did it and it rocked.... sorry for rambling  BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! it rocks.PS... add me up if you join up always looking to expand my roster of friends to play this game with :]			"

												I have played about 10hrs of this game and i think the crew is great. Its like they took the other racing games like need for speed, testdrive unlimited 2 and grid and put them into one. Also, the open world is fantastic, massive and is fun to drive around with others. Another thing i really liked was that it was easy to find people and make a crew. Its not like other games where every think if full or chose for you, you get to choose in the crew.Pros:-Cars (and customization)-Graphics-Map-Cops-Miltiplayer (everything from racing to making your crew)-Story line (so far)Cons:-Car handling isnt as easy as other racing games and dosnt feel as controlable-Graphics are good but i think they could be better- Map is huge but only has bigger cities			"

												A very good game the only complaints i have so far is the devs need to tweek the cops in the game. The cops bust you way too fast which handy caps the player who is trying to escape. In the need for speed series they did a perfect job with the cops and the devs need to learn something from them. The other thing is over steer which to me is the worst thing in game. Over all the game is amazing and a must have.			"

												PRO TIP: If you are having trouble enjoying the game because of the handling model, you can fix that by changing the Control settings in the options. Changing it from ""All assists"" to ""Sport"" will make it feel like you have much more control over the car. Setting the steering speed factor all the way to the right will make it feel a lot less sluggish when turning. Setting sensitivity a bit to the right can also help.During the beta, I found the handling to feel much better after doing this and enjoyed the game quite a lot. Currently playing the full game, and it's just as effective.			"

												The crew. The game might look like something horrible at first or in the tralirs but I can tell you right now that this game is not horrible. The crew is about you trying to seek vengiens for your brothers death. But in the mean time while trying to do that many problems occur. Once you are done with all 50 levles(60 soon to come) the game is not over. You can add cars to your collection do pvp and do the summit to have a chance to win a amazing car. And this game is also online all the time. So you are always playing with players and can make friends. Also this game has wheel support.  Its not the best but Once you get the hang of it It works pretty well. Also all the expansiions/dlcs are  amazing. They add so much to the game. And the best part is that you can get chaced by cops and get to 5 starts and just keep on causing cayous. So get this game. Its worth every penny. SO GET RACING!!!!!			"

I just started the story only, get my car, completed few races and get lvl 3 and that´s all. I do almost nothing. I just send request for refund..So, i really recommended full version, the game is isn´t that bad but in 2 hours i just can´t see everything what i can write to this review.			"

												Let start off on a very clear thing, I like the crew. I have loved it ever since I heard of it, when it came avalible for pre order, I bought it, then went out and bought parts to make sure my computer could handle it. I still like it, getting into a car and just driving across the huge landscape is just extreamly relaxing and thrilling at times.With that being said, I highly recommend you -DO NOT- buy this game. Ubisoft has been for some time trying to be worse than EA in jackassery, and they have somehow suceeded very well. As pointed out by the other reviews, season pass effects nothing with Wild Run, a forced update and major expanshion that the game now prettymuch relies on and costs as much as the normal game, dispite only giving you limited content. [Four new class types and new event zones mainly] If you are able to pick this game up dirt cheap, sure, go for it, the aimless driving is fun, but that is all that this game offers now, aimless driving. I hate Need for Speed, but you'd be highly better off buying one of them, and that hurts for me to admit that.

The Xfinity Speed Challenge (A necessary story mission to continue the game) has a part of the race where the map wont load and you simply can not move. you can not open the map and exit to make it load that patch of land (which works in freeride) and all the other cars simply pass you by driving straight through the nonexistent road which stops you and freezes your car and will not load no matter what you try.

												I have yet to be able to play it. I just downloaded and installed the game today. First the uplay service will not let me create an account... so to get around that I created an account on the ubisoft website directly. Now that I can log in I'm being told that services are down. I can't start in offline mode either because I have yet to be able to properly authenticate my account through their horrible uplay app. This is as bad as Rockstars Social Club or worse. If these game companies can't figure out how to provide software without locking it behind these broken programs then they need to just get out of the buisness. What a complete and utter joke. I'll never buy another uplay title.			"

												Refund pending.Great game, but uPlay is still the garbage barrier to gaming that it always has been. It's bad enough that uPlay makes you go out of Steam to authenticate your purchases, worse still when uPlay doesn't unlock the DLC you've paid for.The Ultimate Edition will not give you the Calling All Units DLC if you purchase it in Steam. I imagine getting the whole thing through uPlay is a safer way to buy this (which is probably what Ubisoft want you to do and the reason why the experience through Steam is so poor).Base game (trial) is great, shame I paid £40 for it and got nothing else.

												If the Need for Speed franchise is tyring to get back to their roots (and I have completed the newest game) they really need to look to these guys for inspiration as this game does a much better job of mixing a good motive to get you started as well as keeping to many of the gameplay elements that made older need for speed games legendary. Having domination and customization at its core. As well, This game is ambitious to say the least, mapping the entire U.S.A to a scale that offers a surprizing veriety of locations to visit and scout. After a year they looked to reinvigorate the game by releasing a sort of overhauling DLC, adding new mechanics, game modes, and vehicle types, Even updating the graphics with new textures and weather effects. the DLC costs $30 but the base game has been reduced putting the whole game with the new overhaul somewhere around 40 - $50, which is well worth the entry for a great example of how to handle an aging brand without pumping out another game within an unrealistic deadline. The mechanics and physics are not on par with the best of the old Need for Speed arcade type open world racer, they feel very loose and a bit unpredictable at times, but for the overall experience the handling gets a pass by me. the open world and storyline feel overarcing and important, something we sorely lack in AAA titles these days, A sense of importance. One problem that holds this game back is the fact that it is set up as an MMO, which means microtransactions, which means spiked economy costs for things that a singleplayer would allow within much more reasonable values, if it were a singleplayer game it would probably have a much longer story and a much bigger payoff to upgrading cars and progressing, but instead we have every car roughly as fast as eachother and performance upgrades unlocking in a random loot counter sort of setup wich makes buying upgrades almost pointless. Just one example of how MMO is most often not the way to go with your game. I think the game would have greatly benefited on being singleplayer focused while having the same online components it already does, the MMO features in the core game are like any other AAA game that tries to go MMO, theyre pointless, its immerssion breaking, its economy stifling, it simply doesnt work. So I give this game a 7/10 (Buy instead of that new NFS)For a person whos played just about every racer under the sun, its a good game to have around if you want to play around in, from time to time, or just see the sites of the U.S in game form.

Loads of little side activities for you to do during open world and alot of elements of co-op and solo gaming.All i would suugest if you are thinking of getting this game is try the free demo first like i did and you can get started on the game and see if its for you and then if you decide to buy it you can just carry on from were you got up too and enjoy the rest of the game :)			"

Posted: April 20
												Let me preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of motorsports and racing games. I was a junior in High school when Gran Turismo 4 launched back in ’05 and it was the sole reason I bought a PS4 that I had saved for from my part time job working at the 99 cent store. On the weekends my friend and I would take shifts driving the 24 hour endurance races. Over the years I have spent many hours playing other “less serious” racing games as well, from everything with the title “Need For Speed” or “Midnight club”; after what I can only assume are thousands of hours spent playing racing games when I started playing “The Crew” I was a bit confounded. This may contain some spoilers.The Crew boasts a wide array of vehicles and specs to choose from; everything from street spec tuner cars, performance muscle cars, bikes, dragsters, drifters, off road rally type vehicles and even the occasional monster truck. With lots of visual customization options to boot, on the surface, it seems like something very similar to midnight club. 	The game starts you off driving an American classic, a ’69 Camaro, and for reasons I don’t quite recall you end up working for the police trying to infiltrate a gang, I think they killed my cousin or something? It’s not really memorable or engaging, but in order to really get money to get cars and unlock new specs you let the story lead you around Detroit, Chicago, New York and then Miami, and after about 13 hours in, I didn’t feel like I was really playing a racing game at all. Sure there are some races sprinkled in the story and they seem more like an afterthought as you spent most of your time trying to beat the clock in point to point missions to spy on your friend. 	By this point in the game I had done some exploring of all the content the game had to offer including police chasing me in my ’67 Shelby GT 500 (yes it is silver) running crates to get car parts to unlock a Bentley and make some cash. I had replayed some story mode races, I even tried some PVP, which was not a race like you might think but a game of capture the flag , or king of the hill , I wasn’t really sure. While wondering around Key West, longing for the game to feel more like a race game then a badly written police drama I stumbled upon a faction mission; A race from Miami to LA! The info about the mission said it would take 2.5 hours! Would it feel like a real race I wondered? I accepted it and off to LA I was in my Dirt Spec’d Ford Focus (in retrospect, not a car I wanted to spend 2 hours in). Fighting our way through Miami Traffic the race was on! And with really no clear indication of where I was headed other than north after about 20 minutes of racing I was in New York, I think. I didn’t really have time to scope out the landmarks while continually trading 1st and 2nd position with another Focus; however, even this fight for the lead didn’t really seem to matter, because in order to complete this mission you only have to place 3rd or better, and there was only 4 cars, you just couldn’t be last, which didn’t seem to be an issue, because the mini in last didn’t seem interested in holding any other position. Another 20 or so minuets and I was driving past Mt Rushmore. Not really sure I felt like I was racing at all, but just investing time into the game to get the 160,000 purse from finishing the mission. 	Turning south and driving through the South West badlands I was trying to come to terms with what this game really was, or find some justification for finishing this race, yet as I came upon the Grand Canyon and hit some seriously long stretches of dirt road I was having fun sliding my little focus around the corners trying to go as fast as I could. Heading north again, towards the Sierra Nevada Mountains I started to think, in spite of everything the game tries to offer it still does not feel like an actually racing game but rather a showcase of motorsport competitions, and tributes to various car movies, like the Fast and the Furious or gone in 60 seconds. Finally as I was blasting down the Pacific coast highway towards Malibu I released “The Crew” is actually a love letter to everything motorsport, unfortunately that letter is written in crayon and authored by Ubisoft.

I play this game on two different computers, this game runs so perfectly on highest graphics because i got an $80 video card thats meant for gaming on one computer. The other one it runs on medium graphics pretty well. GET THIS GAME!! Someone also said they got the game for customizing cars and that when they got it there was a very small amount of customization..this game has so much customization it takes over 20 minutes to just look at all the stickers when you can also edit your car's interior, wheels, fender, underside, hood, color(tons of colors to choose from and in different formats too Ex:Chrome, iridescant, ETC.), +more. Don't be salty AND BUY THIS GAME!			"

Someone also said they got the game for customizing cars and that when they got it there was a very small amount of customization..this game has so much customization it takes over 20 minutes to just look at all the stickers when you can also edit your car's interior, wheels, fender, underside, hood, color(tons of colors to choose from and in different formats too Ex:Chrome, iridescant, ETC.), +more. Don't be salty AND BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Very fun and great game all around. Some of the settings are a bit tricky to get just right. The only issue with this game is the Uplay server, its on, its off, in the middle of game play and forever game loading times, at times. Graphics are great,music lists are a bit short, handling is good.			"

Product received for free
												This is a open world game there you can do missions, race or just drive around like an idiot. This game has very good graphics. You can fast travel without loadingscreen. I realy like the game becaus we can play with controller and it's open world, you can do alot of missions and jump around in freeroam.			"

												I really enjoyed ""The Crew"" and its downloadable contents, mainly for its great open world—the reproduction of the whole United States in a smaller version.Every time I play the game, I am surprised how detailed the environment and the cities really are.Although there are game objects (like houses in small towns around the world map) which do actually appear quite often, it still is fascinating how many different buildings and environmental structures (deserts, mountains, snow landscapes) there are and how it affects the playstyle, giving the player various opportunities to enjoy the game in very different ways.The car selection in the game is good, all in all. If you want great cars however, you almost have to spend real money on as The Crew's in-game currency adds up extremely slowly.The multiplayer functionalitites of the game are fine overall. However, the game's genre would be more accurate without the ""Massive"" in ""Massively Multiplayer Online Game"". Most of the players on your map are multiple kilometers/miles away from you, but when finding one, it is really fun to drive around with the other player. Also, one thing to criticize is the game's always-online ""feature"". Playing the game when the servers are offline, which happens quite frequently, is impossible. I would like it even more if there was an offline mode, making it possible to play alone and without any active online connection.Moving on to the game's story, it is basically like in any other MMO-type racing game. Without spoiling its contents: Not too interesting, but kind of okay. You get phone calls from different people, have to drive to a specific point on a map and have to clear a specific mission. That's it.Ubisoft's DLC policy for The Crew (unlike any other of this publisher's games) is now kind of fair. You get the game for a pretty low price and the two major DLC packages (Calling all Units, including Wild Run) for a decent amount as well—compared to other games, at least. This however does not include all of the car packs, which are ridiculously expensive.The two major DLCs for the game are pretty good, actually, as they add new game mechanics like bikes or even a completely new police mode.Overall, I think that The Crew is a great game to get, mainly due to its open world features. But if you're looking for a racing game that completely focuses on the racing part, you probably want to get another game.The term which would sum up what The Crew is like would probably be ""Need for Speed, but with better online features and a more interesting map"".

												Pro`s:Good funGreat variety of vehiclesMassive map with some great scenic areasPretty well optimisedPlenty to do thanks to a variety of races and challenges (love the monster truck challenges and offroad dirt races)Active online playersPlenty of vehicle customisation (Paintwork, body work, performance etc)Cons:The Ubi launcher (not a deal breaker, but seriously Ubisoft need to ditch it, it is garbage, also not necessary when running through steam)Can`t run people over (yes I get it, this is not GTA)Pay real money in game for some cars (seriously? This is a premium game!) Optional but dumbIn game currency rewards to low (again milked with ability to purchase currency with real money) Again optional but dumbConclusionI really do like this game and the number of hours I have on it is increasing frequently, I fail to understand how they can have the nerve to have microtransactions in a premium game. However they are optional, I choose not to purchase individual additional content or currency with my hard earned. But the game is good arcadey fun with plenty to do in a vast map, I would suggest you shop around though and get a deal on the price like I did.			"

												For the way i feel this way about this game is not really a yes or no on the review its more of a ""EHHHHHHHHHHH"".Its not the whole ""it running problem and lag"" problem it ran fine on my i5 proccesor and GTX 750. the main issue was that i rarely ever played it and when i do i didnt enjoy playing it but you people ask then why didnt you buy it. Well i didnt buy it I was at a friends house and it was all i give you money you buy me a game and there wasnt really any games to get so i got the crew.  I had the game in my Library for a while then one day i get a notafication saying that they will take it away from me because the guy who gifted it to me got his account revoked. Now for the non rambles Pros and ConsPro: Runs goodNo issueCons: nothing really i just dont like racing games			"

												This is a superb arcade racing sim. Besides the wonderful graphics, and cheeky easter eggs that can be found everywhere, the immensity of the map makes freedriving a pleasure. I've racked up far more time just driving around than actually doing missions and pvp. There is a very large array of the finest cars in the world, which need to be tuned to perfection; although that doesn't necessarily mean that when you max out your car's parts you will have an unbeatable car. PVP is where that definition is put to the test.I don't really like multiplayer games, as they often bring out the worst in people, but I do like playing PVP in The Crew because if you can handle your car, then you have an equal chance of beating any player. Ubisoft should be congratulated for resisting the pay-to-win agenda many publishers turn to, to make a quick buck. Indeed, there are cash cars in the game, but again, they aren't supercars that can destroy all unpaying comers. They are just treats. Like the McLaren F1, which is a beautiful car, but that's it. Put it against the Zonda, and it will run very close; it's a shame they didn't put the Bugatti Veyron in, as then I could relive one of my favourite Top Gear episodes: Veyron vs McLarenThe only problem is a major bug; and I mean major. About 90% of the time when I enter the garage to tune a vehicle, the game will crash. This is maddening, and really screws up the enjoyment of the game, as you often try to avoid going to the garage at all. It's a pretty critical part of the game, as the parts you collect for your car are very delicately weighted against every other part. I'm trying to work out if you can build a much better car by slow grinding from lower levels, rather than just pay for a level 50 part. This takes time and concentration, so when you're analysing your parts and the game crashes, then you reload and can't be bothered, or too scared, to go back into the HQ. I've found if you go into the HQ when you first load the game, the game does not crash with such frequency. But who wants to go to the HQ when you've just loaded the game? Rather you go the garage after racking up a load of parts and then want to compare one against the other. Maybe if Ubisoft patched the game so you could tune your vehicle outside the HQ; the system is technically there in options, but you can't compare parts outside of the HQ.Although this is a massive negative for the game, it does not spoil the enjoyment of the game itself, as there's so much to do. Hone your skills against your friends. Play missions, PVE, Factions Missions, and the PVP arenas of course. Again, I usually shy away from PVP, as this often brings out the worst in people, and if you leave collisions on, then you will quickly run into those people. There is also a trend of people's to harass drivers they encounter by ramming them continually, but, if you can handle your car, then you will not have a problem escaping from these morons; and I think this is just loser rage. In other games this would be a good reason to rage-quit, but I don't mind it so much in The Crew, because if you want the best, you have to beat the worst; and I usually always get the better of them on a circuit track with collisions turned off; and believe me, that's a satisfying feeling, especially if they rage-quit after the race XDYes, this is truly a game I can't get enough of. So thanks Ivory Tower for a great driving experience. And please, don't shut down the server any time soon :)			"

Posted: April 20
												Let me preface this review by saying I am a huge fan of motorsports and racing games. I was a junior in High school when Gran Turismo 4 launched back in ’05 and it was the sole reason I bought a PS4 that I had saved for from my part time job working at the 99 cent store. On the weekends my friend and I would take shifts driving the 24 hour endurance races. Over the years I have spent many hours playing other “less serious” racing games as well, from everything with the title “Need For Speed” or “Midnight club”; after what I can only assume are thousands of hours spent playing racing games when I started playing “The Crew” I was a bit confounded. This may contain some spoilers.The Crew boasts a wide array of vehicles and specs to choose from; everything from street spec tuner cars, performance muscle cars, bikes, dragsters, drifters, off road rally type vehicles and even the occasional monster truck. With lots of visual customization options to boot, on the surface, it seems like something very similar to midnight club. 	The game starts you off driving an American classic, a ’69 Camaro, and for reasons I don’t quite recall you end up working for the police trying to infiltrate a gang, I think they killed my cousin or something? It’s not really memorable or engaging, but in order to really get money to get cars and unlock new specs you let the story lead you around Detroit, Chicago, New York and then Miami, and after about 13 hours in, I didn’t feel like I was really playing a racing game at all. Sure there are some races sprinkled in the story and they seem more like an afterthought as you spent most of your time trying to beat the clock in point to point missions to spy on your friend. 	By this point in the game I had done some exploring of all the content the game had to offer including police chasing me in my ’67 Shelby GT 500 (yes it is silver) running crates to get car parts to unlock a Bentley and make some cash. I had replayed some story mode races, I even tried some PVP, which was not a race like you might think but a game of capture the flag , or king of the hill , I wasn’t really sure. While wondering around Key West, longing for the game to feel more like a race game then a badly written police drama I stumbled upon a faction mission; A race from Miami to LA! The info about the mission said it would take 2.5 hours! Would it feel like a real race I wondered? I accepted it and off to LA I was in my Dirt Spec’d Ford Focus (in retrospect, not a car I wanted to spend 2 hours in). Fighting our way through Miami Traffic the race was on! And with really no clear indication of where I was headed other than north after about 20 minutes of racing I was in New York, I think. I didn’t really have time to scope out the landmarks while continually trading 1st and 2nd position with another Focus; however, even this fight for the lead didn’t really seem to matter, because in order to complete this mission you only have to place 3rd or better, and there was only 4 cars, you just couldn’t be last, which didn’t seem to be an issue, because the mini in last didn’t seem interested in holding any other position. Another 20 or so minuets and I was driving past Mt Rushmore. Not really sure I felt like I was racing at all, but just investing time into the game to get the 160,000 purse from finishing the mission. 	Turning south and driving through the South West badlands I was trying to come to terms with what this game really was, or find some justification for finishing this race, yet as I came upon the Grand Canyon and hit some seriously long stretches of dirt road I was having fun sliding my little focus around the corners trying to go as fast as I could. Heading north again, towards the Sierra Nevada Mountains I started to think, in spite of everything the game tries to offer it still does not feel like an actually racing game but rather a showcase of motorsport competitions, and tributes to various car movies, like the Fast and the Furious or gone in 60 seconds. Finally as I was blasting down the Pacific coast highway towards Malibu I released “The Crew” is actually a love letter to everything motorsport, unfortunately that letter is written in crayon and authored by Ubisoft.

The CrewThis is a game I played briefly in Beta and really like the concept of a racing game that lets you travel across the US.  The open world environment allows you to compete in races across the US or just take off and drive anywhere you want from coast to coast without any loading screens. The freedom and choice is yours to make.  Follow the story, venture out and explore, and/or compete in challenges and races. The game feels a lot like Watchdogs if you never left the vehicle only on a larger scale with less people walking around. The vehicles handle similar to the vehicles in Watchdogs intially, but moding them greatly increases performance as you level the car.  Street, dirt, and track veriations of car modifications can be made for all different types of races as well as a large veriety of cosmetic options to customize your ride.  You will not get the sim race track feeling here as the cars are not heavily based on true physics like you would find in the Grid series.  This is definately an arcade style racing game more in line with Need for Speed that provides hours of fun!  Not Just a RacerThe Crew is more than just a traditional racing game.  It is a MMO racing game.  The game is designed to play with other people by joining crews so that you can work together in missions.  Playing with others in your crew provides extra incentives such as experience and cash.  You can put skill points into your bonuses to increase rewards received from playing with your crew members as well as benefits to enhance your car such as reduced repair costs, better breaking, etc. However, the game can be played solo with just as much fun. Weak LinkageAnd here is the weak link in the design of The Crew.  People expecting a MMO will immediately notice that there is no need to join a community to play the game.  The option is there with some rewards but there is no real push to do so. There is also no voice chat built into the game to communicate with your crew members and the pop-up screen is usually hidden to get it out of the way. So even when you do choose to type to crew members, you will seldom get a response. You will find PvE and PvP races/challenges but the need for a community feels absent.  The PvP is fun and I honestly have a blast with some of the game modes.  You will not find any large raid like content here.  It would have been nice to see large cross country races pitting  multiple four man crews against crews or larger 16 plus members competing together in a large scale race against other crews or AI; but what we received was on a much smaller basis for those that want to play solo.  What you will find is a huge open world where you can see people and choose to interact with them or not.  The choice is yours to make. ProsHuge map to ExploreOpen WorldVariety of Race typesVariety of Vehicles/typesVehicle CustomizationGraphicsMMO CommunityConsPhysics are more Arcade than SimWeak MMO CommunityNo voice built in voice chatFinal ThoughtsAfter finishing the game, I still enjoy going back and creating new cars and leveling them up.  I am personally having a blast with this game and recommend it to anyone thats like racing games.   I did not do a first impressions video of this game so I have linked a few videos to give you an idea of what to expect.New Expansion UpdateThe Crew: WIldrun is a DLC expansion coming to the crew with a free overhaul to the graphics and physics engine for all as well as the DLC packed full of quests, races, new race types, vehicles, and vehicle types (monster trucks & motorcycles). It looks amazing!  I cannot wait until November to play it. If only I had a Beta key...For the story:

												This game wasn't worth the purchase for me. If you're looking for a realistic driving multiplayer game, this is not it. Your only solution to evading police or winning races is by driving around them. If you try and push them, you'll slam in to a wall and spin out of control. Your sessions hold a very minimal amount of players that you will only ever come across if you actively seek them.The trailer made this game look like it would be a very fun play, but it is very repetitive and eventually boring. The fact that cops can drive at impossible speeds and ram you like a wall doesn't help.			"

												Ubisoft really good at trailer, really impress, but the gameplay is VERY BAD.- AI is incredible stupid, they will just speeding and does not slow down during corner, even after a horrible crash, AI still manage to chase you. A simple mistake and you have to restart the race and replay.- Citizen cars always spawn randomly in front of you.- You always lose becaue of last minute car crash(random spawn cars).- You need to buy crew cash to learn more skil point (which is really bad, pay to win?)- Never drive with others. No one is joining your crew.- Police car always faster than your car no matter what car you are driving.- Your car made of Toufu, and other cars are make of metal.- Control is a mess.There is too many things to complain. I regret bought this game. I will only hope i can finish the game story and hope Need for Speed 2015 is better than this.			"

												The CrewThe crew is a large, open world environment with lots of multiplayer aspects and huge POTENTIAL. But from there, it’s all a bit downhill. I bought it because I wanted a driving game where you could customise your car, get chased by cops, play with friends even for a nice little drive down a motorway at 200km/h.I got what I asked for, but not what I paid for. I get my custom car, which then gets pulled away from me for mission specific cars. Now, I’m in a mission with an unfamiliar car and AI designed to be perfect. I know they are. Get the perk which shows you the lines to a race mission, I almost guarantee that the AI in 1st will be perfect to that line. Have all the skill you want, if you don’t take shortcuts or have the better car, you won’t win and if that’s the case, don’t even bother going for a perfect score. I know there are people out there who are pros and know every corner, every braking point and every shortcut. I can only imagine how much time they spent and how much sass from the NPCs they got. And then there are the regular AI cars. Not the race ones, just the normal run-of-the-mill pedestrian cars. God help if you’re going for a high score and one of those come along and pull into the lane you’re in about 50m from you.♥♥♥♥♥♥happens, but not to the AI racers.Then the authorities. Hands up all those who love a good chase scene. I do, and I thought “Yeah, lots of road and different terrain, this should be good.” Oh sweet innocence. First, find a patrol car and then crash into stuff. Problem. Find one. I’d hate to believe that there are only two patrol cars in New York. Of course, if you destroy enough stuff, you might initiate a car chase, but only after ruining the front of your vehicle and giving half a city a reason to build a concrete wall as opposed to fences. Of course, you won’t get booked if you ram into all their parked cars unless a patrol car is nearby. Oh and don’t worry about pedestrians either, they’ll jump out of your way while your barrelling down the road at high speeds. You may have noticed I’ve refrained from using the word “cop”. This is because, if you find one on foot, try running him down. He’ll jump out of your way and yell obscenities at you no matter how many times you try. Won’t even call for backup.Multiplayer. Oh boy. My friend and I tried to do a multiplayer session. We attempted about three times with it saying “unable to join crew”. About to give up, we tried once more. *pop*. We’re in lobby together. Okay then, well, we’re in, let’s meet up. We did, or rather, our name tags did. Neither of us could see each other’s car, and we were poorly synced, to the point where I would ram a cop car next to my friend which would proceed to arrest me with my friend laughing because there was nothing there.Hmmm….have I missed something. Oh yes, state of the art graphics from 2011, forced music when in missions (I like my classical), handling which feels like the roads are made of ice and a story which feels like it was pulled out of the “Hat of predictable story lines” with more plot holes in it than the Brony Clopper fandom.

It is a 2015 ""next gen game"" but the mirrors dont even work... its a car game. Racing games from 13 years ago had operating mirrors. The car selection is bad, the customization is horrible, physics are bad, the damage is nonsense, every car feels the same, every mission is the same, online is completely unenjoyable, and the cutscenes ughhh the cutscenes your cars glitch back and forth its really bad the whole pursuit is bad when your at a stop and you have just one police officer on you, you mine as well just give up. The graphics are like early ps3 graphics and a bit boring. I just want my money back so i can buy GTA V... "

												I had high hopes for this game, it turned out to be a total waste of money.The AI in the game is rigged, no matter how many upgrades you get, the AI will always zip away. The whole game feels disconnected and seems to pay no attention to the experience of the player.Any victories feel more like a matter of luck than skill effectively defeating any sense of accomplishment the player might receive.It is NOT the open world MMO racing game it pretends to be. Your character is a bearded hipster that resembles the guy from Half-life. You are forced into a boring, cut and paste, extremely linear storyline that reeks of a bad Fast and Furious movie. The missions are lackluster and feel like a huge chore.Dont get me started on RAID or the Garbage truck mission, or the time I logged in and the server reverted and 6 hours of achivements and part unlocks were magically gone. (RAGE!!!!) Contacting support is a joke.I can’t believe I got suckered in for $60.00 bucks! this game is one big lie!			"

												Even though the car handles decently (albeit arcade-ish) and the graphics are also good (not great, mind you), the Uplay service really f*** it up, by dropping when you enjoy the game most. I was in the middle of a 2.5 hours checkpoint race for the Wolves when the connection was lost and the bloody game demanded to exit to Windows. The race was started Solo, so there is absolutely no need for an always-on connection!!! Such a turn off, really! I guess those who are playing the offline, pirated version don't need to put up with this crap!			"

												Every couple of months you have to buy the $25 DLC, or else you lose all of your vehicles!!! Don't even think about playing without the DLC, because there is no game without it. Whenever a new DLC comes out, the one you previously bought doesn't exist anymore. It is LITERLY replaced entirley by the new DLC without a refund! You have to rebuy the DLC! When a new DLC comes out, you don't even get a huge difference. maybe a new gamemode or car, but barely anything. This was a waste of money.(PS: There is an Ubisoft Fan boy that goes by ""Rgeers"" on Steam.)			"

												Well, normally I don't write reviews of games, since it's always a personal opinion and a question of wether or not you can live with the faults a game might have. All games have problems, but with the release of the Wild Run DLC, I feel scammed.Originally I pre-ordered the Limited edition of The Crew, setting me back 65€, including season pass and all DLC car packs available at the original release date. After the release of Wild Run, all these have been revoked and needs to be bought once again. That means I have spent around 20€ on something, I will now have to pay for once again. And that's on top of the 25€ I have spent on the Wild Run DLC, which in hindsight I shouldn't have, since they call it a DLC, and therefor it should be part of the The Crew season pass, and not a seperate expansion mini-game, like you would see in other MMOs.Legal or not, the fact that they now force people to buy all the DLCs once againt, this is ethically not something, I want to support. On forums I have seen, that I am not the only one to have experienced this, and with that business model in mind I would not recommend this game.The game itself is suffering from a few bugs, some worse than others, but the most annoying is the endless disconections, usually at the most crucial time during a race.I can live with bugs, but I have a hard time spending money on buying the same game once more.

												Okay, so this is an alright game despite UBISOFT shouldn't even attempt to make a Racing MMO, the MMO factor is kind of garbage because all the other cars just rubberband. And I should mention that not of the car features are even close to realistic. I kind of excepted this with my purchase considering this didn't look like a serious driving simulator anyway. In all, I have lot's of fun on this game with my friends. You should only buy this game if you want to have a fun cruise with your friends and doing roadtrips and stuff. The story is fun too but is kinda stupid. Good luck with your purchase and I hope you don't waste your $60 or $85 whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is. It's all personal preference to be honest.			"

I was very wrong, in fact, most everything about The Crew is a huge disappointment. This game belongs in the steam greelight corner. What ive gathered from forcing myself to play more of The Crew - unfinished, buggy, horrifingly bad gameplay mechanics, physics engine that never seems to work, and worst of all, unrealistic to the point where NFSUG2 looks damn real in comparision.

												Just. Don't even bother. A complete and utter waste of money that would be better spent on CS:GO cases. The mechanics are completely broken and unplayable. You can count how many cars there are in the game with your fingers, You want more cars? Too bad! Gotta pay extra for them sonny.Cars are like tanks and gravity in that game is apparently 200x that of normal earth. Goku's gonna have a grand old time.Seriously. A 1969 Dodge Charger RT has 5 speed transmission? Where did that come from? The sound of the cars in the game's as authentic as my Hotwheels collection. Made in Taiwan.If you're going to buy this game for the multiplayer, don't. It's as unexistant as Ellen Page's boobs. You have friends that play The Crew, you say? Good. You can be as idiotic as them for buying this game. The only real reason I ever bought this melarky is because it was on sale. The only reason my play time exceeds 2 hours(Steam's policy for a refund) is because of my perfectionism when playing games. Lo and behold, there was a collectible HotRod you could use after painstakingly searching for them and even so, the HotRod was incredibly not worth the effort.All in all, don't buy it, don't look at it, don't talk about it. - 2/10 ""Dissapointing""IGN - 9/10			"

												Good racing game, reminiscent of Burnout Paradise.  Ubisoft brings a massive wide open world to join up with friends and drive around completing races and winning money.  While it has a few bugs and gripes, it's generally still a fun game.  Playing multiplayer can sometimes have its faults.  Other players' cars will sometimes jostle around the road or almost ""vibrate"".  Makes it hard to race with friends and stay close to their bumper without hitting them and knocking them off course.  I have been disconnected quite a few times while playing multiplayer, which requires restarting the game to fix.  Hopefully these are all bugs that will be corrected, and not just pushed aside and forgotten when Ubisoft decides to just stop supporting the game.			"

The DLC is not worth it unless you really like one or two of the cars. Otherwise if you don't want to bother with DLC get this game it's fun, but please get Wild Run that is the most worth while one.

												I Love this game!Just since I wached the trailer video.So I Bought it without wating any discount - -This game is the kind of style  which I love. just like escape the cop pursuit,the true Reality Manufacturers Cars,And you can Customize your car In many ways. Form STREET to OFFROAD to CIRCUIT,You can tune your car to many difference style.That mean You will have fun in this game whatever you like any kind of racecar! :)The old saying goes;""Every coin has two sides.""This game is a Multiplayer games online,you can call for help if you can't pass a difficult misson,You can also have fun with friends.BUT!but some time the network maybe awful,It always lost connection! always lost connection! That means I can't play this great game very often.That made me feel regret :(I am Extremely hope The Ubi soft update this game,add the Singleplayer mode!Just like <Driver: San Francisco> .Rally extremely hope!At last,sorry for my poooooor English.从看宣传片开始，我就彻底爱上这个游戏了，真实厂牌的车辆，高自由度的改装，警匪追逐，不同的比赛模式，从街头赛车到沙漠Baja再到职业赛道，无论你喜欢什么样的赛车游戏，都能从这款游戏上得到满足。所以这游戏没等打折我就买了= =凡事都有不足，这款游戏最让人失望的是没有单机模式，这意味着即使你单人过任务也要登录国际服务器，或许是我网络的问题，服务器经常失去连接，游戏是好游戏，但是我没机会经常玩，希望育碧官方能更新单人模式，就像前作《狂飙:旧金山》那样。谢谢。			"

												So much potential ruined by greed and Ubisoft's practices.  It's a AAA title you pay full price for, then has all the elements of a F2P title.Pay to win/Pay to progress1)  After buying the game for $40-60, you're given a starting car that is very underpowered and handles like crap.  It takes a *lot* of time to grind out upgrades, level up your character, and earn perks.  OR, you can pay a few real dollars and unlock a super car straight away.  Not with premium currency, *literally* with real world money.  However:2)  There IS premium currency.  You can buy packs of Crew Credits to unlock parts and upgrades faster.This wouldn't be an issue if you could only buy cosmetic things, but the cars on sale for real cash and the parts you can get with premium currency give you an edge over most players in PvP.Also, don't forget Uplay.  If you launch the game from steam, Uplay has to load up and sync, then the game tries to load.  Which can really bog down your system for no apparent reasons.Game performanceFor some reason your car stutters and jumps all over the place in cutscenese.  However you're fine during the gameplay itself (albeit capped at 30 to 60fps).  This has been a bug known since before release from what I've been reading, but nothing's been done to fix it.Your car handles like crap.  If you watch closely, when you're travelling at speed your car doesn't follow real world physics: it pivots on an axis instead of turning.  This is extremely apparent if you visit a highway with steady curves or a race track, you can watch as the trunk of the car slides out and the wheels don't line up to where the car is heading when you're not drifting.Speaking of wheels not lining up, visit an airport.  The aircraft (which are all scaled down and scaled up copies of each other) are just static models that slide around.  Their wheels don't spin and the nose gear doesn't turn.  Heck, they don't have any animations at all, and their engines are obvious polygons.  I haven't seen aircraft that poorly modelled since 1998.In conclusion:  Hell no.  I wasted $40 on a game where you have to grind for days on end before you're even competitive, or give Ubisoft more money.(The tiny straw that broke the camels back:  They made New York and Chicago huge and detailed, but my ENTIRE state gets a few highways and a handful of buildings?  The two towns they added and named are literally a dozen or so buildings.  And they're both tourist trap villages, they didn't add our biggest city or our capital.)EDIT:  almost forgot!  The AI cheats.  Regardless of how much more upgraded your car is, they speed up to keep up with you, and dirt roads don't affect them.  They get to fly at max speed as if they're on pavement, while you're struggling to stay on the track as you drift around corners.  Even if your Dirt Spec is levelled up far more than theirs.			"

												I will separate this into two categories: Single Player and Multiplayer. Seeing as both have different stories to tell, I feel it would be appropriate to split them up. Warning, there may be spoilers, but nothing that will ruin the whole story. Enjoy.Single player:The single player has a great story, as do most games made by Ubisoft. You start the story as Alex Taylor, a man and brother who gets put into prison and framed for his brothers' death, which was caused by the main antagonist, Shiv. Throughout the story, you compete and earn your rank through a sort of street gang lead by various characters by their status, (V2, V4, V6) ultimately trying to get to the top, V8, where Shiv stands. Each city you unlock, which I might add are major cities throughout the United States, (LA, New York, Miami, etc.) you gain new members to your crew, or basically guidance and emotional support to your driving and discovery of locations, races and more. Your crew becomes a valuable asset to you, both becoming good friends and especially people you can count on. Now, for the actual review part:The single player had some good moments, great scenes, and overall a great racing experience. The handling of vehicles is the best I've seen throughout all my years of racing games, and takes the cake for that. The only thing I really wish they would have done was spend more time on the ending. It seemed very rushed and very anti-climactic. This though does not change my overall feel of the game, I still love it. Multiplayer:Multiplayer can be a separate story on its own simply in the fact you can basically go anywhere, with anyone. Traveling far distances with friends or strangers can be quite a great experience, especially if you can tolerate driving for literally hours at a time in real time. To put into perspective, you can probably make it across the whole map (let's say LA to Maine) in about an hour, or close to. This is driving at full speed, at least at 330km/h (at least I was). There's plenty of places to visit, plenty of great atmospheric areas to go to. It can be very biased, but if you're not into driving for hours at a time, I wouldn't bother playing multiplayer, I'd just stick to the story. All in all, it's a great game for what it's worth, can include hundreds of hours of multiplayer time if you're into it, or if not, you can free roam around at your will (and even go offroading in a dirt spec or raid vehicle!).

Posted: January 12, 2015
												This game had a lot of potential, but in the end its just a giant failure.Graphics: The game looks really nice and runs pretty smoothly when other players arent near you, i am able to maintain a constant 50-60 FPS, my system stays cool and i dont get stuttering too often unless im driving over 200 MPH. The enviroment is attractive and makes exploring the huge map even more worthwhile, the waters not the most attractive but its not an issue since you should be spending most your time staring at the road or the cars.Customization: Theres enough to make your car unique and the game allows every spec to be different so your car can look completly different in street then it does in performance. However Raid and Cicuit spec have almost no custumization available and dirt spec is sometimes lacking as well. Also higher end cars ussually have less then cheaper cars meaning aventadors and vipers ussually look identical while mustangs and camaros can be heavily customized.Map: Its large, it takes about 30-60 mins to to drive between 2 major areas (ex. Detroit to Miami, Maine to Texas, NY to LA) mostly highway averaging around 160MPH. Most areas look pretty accurate and you can ussually guess where you are if you have seen the place in real life, however many areas are located FAR from where they should be and some are sized quite oddly, for example Salem MA is up in Maine and Miami is most of florida.Cars: This is one area where the game fails miserably, while it does have some great cars the balance is horrible and very unrealistic, mini cooper is one of the fastest cars in the game, bentley continental outruns sklyine gtrs and vipers with no issues, no point buying an expensive dirt spec since the ford focus is pretty much the best for dirt, mustangs are faster, better handling, and have better traction then the 370z, the murcielago feels like its on ice all the time ect. Many cars cant be put into specs that make perfect sense to be available, most supercars cant be circuit, f150 cant be raid spec, golf gti cant be anything but street spec, high end cars can ussually only be performance spec and thats it. AI uses vehicles in specs that you cant for example circuit spec trucks, Some cars are just pointless like the golf gti and  jeep cherokee, and others are so expensive its not worth getting since there are faster cars for half the price. Also when theres only about 30 cars in the game why would you have 4 lamborghinis, 4 mustangs, 3 Trucks and 2 SUVS, 2 camaros, and 2 chargers, but not include any hondas, mitsubishis,porches or toyotas and leave out cars like the suburu impreza and lancer evo despite how well they would work for street and dirt spec.Driving: Suprisingly the game worked perfectly with my g27 racing wheel as well as an xbox controller without needing any configuring or calibration(other then turning driving assists off). It has a lot of options for adjusting force feedback, steering deadzone and sensitivity making it easy to get a comfortable set up as well. Unfortanetly despite good settings the game feels very unrealistic, collisions never make sense sometimes you go flying 1000ft into the air other times you bounce off like nothing happened, other times a bump at 10MPH totals your car, some cars spin out randomly for no reason, traction is terrible for some cars, theres no difference between FWD, RWD or 4WD , for some cars the game handles very arcadey much like an old need for speed game where you can just drift sideways through a corner without slowing, other cars you NEED to brake before a corner like you would in a simracer. Also if you play manual transmission on a controller expect to be heavily disadvantaged since the only way to reverse is to shift all the way down to 1st, then down to nuetral then into reverse and theres a forced pause between every shift so you cant just drop two gears quickly.Online: Honestly, dont even bother. For one the game has no level scaling so all pvp is mixed together meaning a lv 300 f150 will be expected to race lv 1299 (max lv) lamborghinis and vipers. PVP is very buggy and laggy cars teleport 500yds ahead of you, cars lag into you causing you to crash, and disconects are very common, back on track feature sometimes places people far ahead of where they were, and sometimes you can clearly finish in 2nd only to have the game tell you you finished in 4th. PVP is also full of hackers and the developers dont seem to care, expect to see a lot of people with infinate nos, 300MPH cars, invincible cars that dont get slowed or moved when rammed into and even some people who just instantly win the race shortly after it starts. even if you do get a match without hackers or terible lag its boring since everyone only chooses highway races in performance spec with traffic off and then everyone is in either an aventador, bentley, or one of the free cars from the season pass, ive never seen a pvp in dirt, street or raid spec, ive only found a couple of circuit specs, and ive only seen about 10 of the 30 cars in the game in pvp. Outside of PVP the other players on the map can be really annoying, you will probably never see them while dirving around exploring but go to a skill challenge and expect 5 people to telaport there after you and start parking in the way or even trying to ram you off the road for no reason.AI: the AI cheats...A LOT. doesnt matter what car your in or how fast your going the ai will be faster, cops will catch your 250MPH ford GT in a crown victoria, ram your Hummer H1 off the road easily without damaging their own car, cops can arrest you if your driving below 40MPH for more then 3 seconds and they teleport to your position sometimes if your escaping. Races against ai can be really annoying because the game decides to tell you that you were in 3rd place despite finishing 1 mile ahead of the 2nd place guy, the AI will teleport miles ahead in a race sometimes and you cant ram them off the road but they so much as bump you and your sent flying off the road.Multiplayer: The games really fun to play with friends however i played the whole story mode with a friend and we did all but 3 mission at least twice due to the game disconecting one of us after winning and not giving us credit for completing it on almost  EVERY SINGLE RACE.Overall: Its a fun game to play with friends, tons to explore, cars are expensive so theres a lot of farming to do, plenty of acheivments, skill challenges and multi hour races if your a completionist, however its a mess of flaws, bugs, cheating AI, lag, disconects after races, and the pvp is honestly by far the worst pvp i have ever played.

												Score: 80	 Author: geekl33tgamer	 Test Drive Unlimited Reddux?http://www.geekl33tgamer.co.uk/reviews/198-the-crew-reviewFrom the outset, the core concept of the game seems very appealing to anyone who has ever picked up a copy of any recent Need for Speed title, or the poorly executed (but great idea) Test Drive Unlimited game. Here we have a huge sprawling online world, filled with literally thousands of players, all going about their own thing with a Need for Speed and Burnout inspired driving model.The games career play is a very cinematic affair, and within the first few minutes of starting the game you’ll soon start to understand how this game’s style will play itself out. You start off with some cut-scenes of a chase which you get thrown into, this is basically your tutorial. You need to race to the checkpoint marker whilst keeping the vehicle pointing in the general direction. It was certainly a very entertaining start to a game if ever there was one.You get taken to a garage, meet some key characters who set the scene for the plot in the career play, and you need to buy a car. To begin, you only have a selection of 4 cars to buy, and once you have chosen one your given brief tutorials to the tuning system, car upgrades, perk points and such. There’s not a lot you can buy at this stage, but it’s handy to remember where these things are for later when you have enough cash.You then begin your journey, working undercover for the FBI whilst infiltrating the 510 car faction. So as not to spoil it for anyone, we shall not go on any further about the plot within The Crew as may are still playing through it, or may not have purchased it yet.When you have a required first few events of the tutorial / prologue out the way, you are free to play The Crew however you wish. You can crack on with the career play, or so exploring. This is where you get your first look at the seemingly huge map that you have to play in. It is littered with icons of all the events you can do, your friends positions are shown as well as the major cities.Our first thoughts were that the map is very, very large – however we quickly found out that it isn’t. Despite appearing large, we can drive from the east coast to the west in a little over an hour. Missions as you play them will move you over most of it, but we felt a little disappointed it wasn’t as expansive as the map from Test Drive Unlimited for example. It doesn’t feel too small neither, but isn’t as unwieldy as it first appears to be.As you explore the world, between events on literally every road are skill events you can just drive into at full speed to activate a mini-challenge. This helps break up the monotonous task of driving long distances between places, and gives you extra cash to spend in-game as well as car parts and experience points. Once you’ve explore enough areas, the game has a fast travel feature so you can easily jump back to anywhere you’ve previously been. If you discover the airports and train stations, you can also use these.The major US cities litter the map, and the world is busy with jots of NPC traffic filling up the places. The cities never really feel big enough, but we understand the compromises that they had to make here to a point. Each city has a unique vibe and appearance. The mountain sections look particularly impressive, as does the games day and night cycle. It creates a great environment overall.There are 4 cars to start with, but you can purchase any of the others as you discover new garages on the map. New garages unlock new classes of cars, but for a car game the total amount of cars we counted was only 45. We know Ubisoft plan to add more (with a season pass, sold extra), but the amount in the game does seem disappointing.Of the cars that are in there, they are nicely replicated visually. Each car you buy can be upgraded and tuned into different cars to suit your environment or event. Almost all the cars can be upgraded to street spec, performance, track, dirt and raid classes. The latter 2 are heavy duty modifications that make your car great off road, while the others lend themselves well to road racing. You can customize most visual areas of the car, upgrade its engine parts, and add decals. It adds enough to the car customization to make the cars to make them feel like they are personally yours, but the tuning options do not go deep enough for some. The upgrade parts are fixed, so you can buy varying grades of better brakes, or a differential, but you can’t tweak them if you wanted to say shift the brake bias forward.Perhaps the limiting of the granularity in the tuning area is deliberate so the game is more accessible. We don’t mind it as it does offer enough, but I know from speaking to players while racing, some were not happy with it. They equally wasn’t thrilled by the cars handling model. It is very much in the arcade category, but we expected that. It makes the game enjoyable to zoom around and have fun without needing to pay too much attention to corner entry lines and braking – Instead you can hone your skills on seeing how high you can jump off the ski-slope for example.Now, this is perhaps the game’s biggest selling point, and in Ubisoft’s own words they say “You’ll never drive alone”. I need to make it clear from the get go that this game does not have all the Uplay problems that come with Watch Dogs at launch, or any of the other recent titles released – However there are still problems.We had no problems getting into the servers on launch day, despite the large surge of traffic, but the connection reliability has been ropy from time to time while playing. Without any warning whatsoever, if your connection drops for even a second, you’re returned to your desktop with an error message about the servers not being reached. That is coupled with the fact that every time it does this, some of your game progress gets lost. When you re-load the game, you will invariably find yourself many miles from where you actually were when it threw you out. This unfortunately happens with varying frequency, but it is something they are aware of so we hope it improves.Another widely touted feature was the ability to form a Crew on the fly from either your friends or others who are in the world with you. Crews are important to help with the co-op options available in most missions – Some are quite difficult to do on your own, so pulling in others is an easier way to beat that one mission you may have been stalled on.Sadly, we encountered several problems with this that could easily take up most of this review. We had problems adding friends into Uplay first off, and getting the game to recognize them in the game so I could add them. All too often friends in Uplay would not appear within the game itself. When they did, getting them added to the crew is simply an exercise of luck. Constant errors and timeout’s hampered forming a Crew on the fly as intended, and I found myself driving around by myself a lot of the time as a result. It’s currently near impossible to add players who are in a different country to yourself too, and this frustrate me further.As a final nail in the coffin where online play is concerned, if you have the game in Steam as we do, you can’t invite your Steam friends into a game at all. You need to ask your friend for their Uplay ID, try and add them and then go through the process above.I feel players who buy into the game expecting a racing simulator should steer well clear, but if Need for Speed and Burnout style games are your thing, we think you’ll love The Crew. We do.			"

												The Crew is a great game, I strongly recomend this game if you follow freeroam car simulators. It almost feels like TDU3!!! (test drive unlimited for those who don't know the abbreviation) You can Drive to pretty much any city in the United states of America that has a world profile! Another great feature about this game is that you can endlessly customize cars by completing missions and skill challanges. I hope this review convinces you to purchase this game as it will be a decision you will not regreat. ;)			"

												TL:DR9/10 Closed beta.  Awesome for casual and competetive racing. So the closed beta, what do i think.  First of let me state that i saw the trailer from e3 or whenever the game was presented for the first time, and I thought to myself; this looks like crap.  Who would want it?So iam sitting here, kinda bored and looking at games and The Crew Closed beta is up if I preorder.  Hmm, let me look at the reviews.  Read about 3 of em until someone says, i remindes of Midnight Club.  There i was sold.  I start it up and skip all of story and such.  After some races I get into freedrive. I get about an hour until i need to go.  Its okey. I hate my Mucle car.  Next day, let me get to a car dealer, pick up a Ford Focus. Spend all my money to upgrade it. And think lets roll.  Well the next 5 hours is a blur of streetraces, cops trying to kill me,  players trying to kill me and alot of jumpes.  I havent had this much fun in a car game since the last Midnight Club.  I think this game will be great, i certainly had alot of fun in the beta, and can not wait until realease.Pros-Huge World-Race Tracks-Hidden objects -The community (all the crazy drivers out there)-The car customaztion-Good ""car driving"" feel (not too realistic but hard)  (I played on the car setting of hardcore, do not know anything about the other settings)Cons-I fear the ingame microtransactions-Some bugs (like a tree in the middle of the railtracks)-Cops needs to care about speeding not just dmg to them or other cars-Beta was limited to 30 fps.  (get atleast 60)But for me this was a good 9 - 10/10			"

												I bought this game while high yesterday and god damn was it a wrong purchase.The game seems like it would work pretty well, if it did so smoothly.Problem here is that the game is terribly optimised. On a high end rig that can easily support Arma 3, this game runs smooth but has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of occasional framespikes which cause you to ram into something at high speeds.Now don't get me wrong; even when i was high i wasn't blind: i saw the game's description claiming it's ment for high-end PC's and next gen consoles, but that's just a very very weak way of saying ""Our game doesn't even look that good but runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you complain we'll blame it on your specs!"".In reality the game itself looks very very meh. I've only played a couple of missions so far and from what i've seen the world is empty and very forced at looking alive.For example, you see the low res environment around you (and yes, it really does look ugly and different than the cars), and you realise it's just a HUGE big open map with forced events. You'll have a cop car race out an alley and stand there as if he's going to chase you, you'll have fake people driving around to create the illusion you're not in a boring old sandbox and you'll be reminded how bad the game really looks for the framerate lag you have to pull yourself through to compensate for it.Has a lot of potential but you'd need a 2000/3000€ pc to run this ""like the publishers suggest"".Which kind of just means they didn't feel like optimising this bad port and you are to blame for not having a better PC.Haven't gotten into the game that much but the driving is extremely simple and the physics are trash. I rammed into some cops at the opening sequence and proceeded to ram the fake players i encountered on my way from race to race, what i saw was my giant truck and my majestic american muscle car get twirled around like the physics engine went ""What the ♥♥♥♥ bro this isn't my job i don't know what to do i'll just make♥♥♥♥♥♥spin or something"".Really, really have no idea why i bought this game yesterday, but the ""mostly positive"" rating is misleading at best.My guess is that i wanted an open world racing game as if you'd play GTA 5 but with much better driving and focused on this.Nope, enjoy normal AI cars that have stupid nametags of random uplay accounts slapped above them, because that feels so real!Man i had more of a feeling of co-op driving when i was mimicing AI driving styles in GTA vice city.-Disclaimer-I don't have 0.4 hours in the game at the time of this review because the game barely runs. The game runs on 60FPS (capped at that), but it feels like it's poking you with a rapier every time you're trying to race by freezing your screen every once in a while even on low settings, this is a sign of poor optimisation.EditForced myself to play it a little more to get my money's worth (got it from a third party website), but the game seems to stutter and lag even more at lower settings and it is visually as attractive as a skinned rat.Looks like you're playing a ps2 port, plays like it's an ps6 port.

												It is a decent game, but for the price, and the fact that in the middle of a live mission, you get stuck in any ♥♥♥♥ing way, you are screwed... this is a huge problem, especially when you are running a hour+ long mission and you get slammed into a guard rail where your bumper gets stuck on and you have NO way to get unstuck except quit the damn mission... I am giving this game a negative rating because I feel this ruins a lot of the end-game play, but it was a decent game till I was racing hour+ missions and realizing this happens often enough for it to be a big deal and months after release this is still not fixed.

												So I'll start off with saying that this game was not at all what I expected. The little research I put into the game gave me the impression it was more of a Gran Tourismo/ Forza fell rather than the Need for Speed game that it is. The tuning system is very simple and easy to use. In regards to customizing performance there isn't any adjusting specific specifications. The entire system is based on ""part 4"" is better than ""part 3"" by xxx points. Simple and effective, just not what I expected.The games racing phsyics are probably my biggest complaint. It has a very arcade feel. Say there is a pebble in the road. We'll call it 'bob'. Say you hit bob on a run with your front left tire at +100mph plus. Bob may just nudge you a little bit causing you to have to steer and correct course. Another run you may clip the same bob at 40mph on your rear right and find your vehicle 30ft in the air while spinning like you were shot from a canon. Then your next run bob decides to take your front left tire at 80mph and throw you into a spin where you may travel over 50yards off road before being able to regain control. Now I love my wrecks but some sort of consistency in the games phsyics would be expected of a game title like this.  All in all the game is still fun. It even has a ton of acheivments to unlock, plenty of vehicles for your specific taste, visual customizations are abundant also. End game gameplay is fun and they offer various styles of events to enterain your mood what ever it is.I'll keep playing it so look for me in game. Always down for a pvp event.			"

												I have played a lot of racing games from sims to arcade racers, and I have not found a better racing game. This game truely has it all; two tracks, bayous, jumps, cities, MILES upon MILES of roads. The scope is simply amazing. I have seen some people say that this game lacks detail because of the size, but I simply don't think thats true. Going through my neck of the woods (Michigan area) I can clearly see they nailed the look and feel of the state, and I think the pure size only enhanses the experience. As for the handling think heavy Need For Speed influence with maybe a hint of Burnout. Definitely not a game for the people who are simulation master race, more of a fun game for everyone else who just loves driving for the enjoyment. There is nothing more satisfying than logging in with some friends and just cruising across the Rocky Mountains or flying through the Vegas dunes, and thats why this game is so good.As for the bad, there isn't a whole lot. My main complaint would be with the AI being able to hang with you even if your car is rated over double theirs. However this makes the game more challenging, so its not really much of a con. Also the disabiling missions aren't very fun. They are all doable since the AI takes the same path every time, its just annoying the first time you hit them and they have 6 health and you have to chase them for 60 seconds only to love tap them and kill them.Pros:- Great arcade driving feel- Huge world- Cruising with your friends across AmericaCons:- AI rubber bands hard even if you have an insane car- The disabling missions aren't funOverall: 9.5/10Anyone who gives this game less than a 7 missed the point.

												I would highly recomend this game to everyone who has not pre-purchased this game yet, i played in the recent beta that just ended today and my god I had already put in 21 hours in this game! i never expected it to be an exact replica of the U.S but the huge map is quite impressive especially with no loading screens freaking road trip central!!!! Yeah there were bugs but nothing to serious and if you love to drift like I do then your sort of in luck it may change for the better, but at first I was sad because I could not drift the corners on the street with the street spec vehicle but soon found out that the dirt spec on snowy/dirt mountains both up hill and down hill were like heaven. Also its just fun to drive around and see a group of people and just roll with them without even having to join there crew, I did this a couple of times and the experience was like none other, it was almost as if I was with a family or a group of friends just traveling across the country free as can be! remind you on both of these experiences there was like 8 to 12 of us!

												Simple the most awesome and fun making car / racing game I have seen for PC for years.Even doing simple road trips is highly enjoyable. The cop chases are intressting and there a neat variation of race types.And the car personalisation is wonderful. There may some games with more visual costumization options but there also many that ignore the topic. You should have no trouble to get your car to your personal tastes.And then there the car list with is wonderful, there something for every taste in there and for diffrent type of driving as well. (On road, as well as offroad, there something for everyone).And ultimativly its a car game that has car interior view. How many other games are trying to avoid that for the sake of saving money and time?!In Short this game is just awesome, and if you like driving / racing and cars then this is defintly something you should consider to check out!

												This is more of a first impression review of the game in the first day of the Closed Beta!In short: if you like to customise, an open world game, nice graphics and fun co-op/online this is the game for youPro's:- nice graphics- the handling is smooth (though this is more an opinion, also, expect arcade handling over realism)- various music genres (which i dislike when they stick to one genre, give something for everybody to choose; also, you can change between radio and sountrack in the options (if you want to add drama to your races)).- a HUGE open world driving- very social/competitive: you get constant updates whats going on around you, there are always players nearby- much custom, such wow: you can change appearance of your car (which doesn't affect it's performance). it's nothing in-depth (not sure if it will come in the final release) but there is plenty to choose from to make the car look like you want it to look.Cons:- buggy sometimes (i encounter some slight freeze (for 5s) when a race enters and i get swapped to the next screen))- (not really a con, but quite strange) the need for uplay (which loads quite easily together with the game)			"

												I really want to love this game, I really do.But I'm just not feeling The Crew, on paper, this game seems amazing, maybe even one of the best racing games ever made. The idea is revolutionary.Too bad the gameplay is sub-par.The car handeling is just about the worst I've personally seen. Maybe I'm just used to the NFS/GRID series, I don't know. The cars just seem so weird, you either oversteer or understeer 75% of the time, I just don't feel it.The idea for a ""Racing MMO"" is fantastic. Sadly, I can't really take advantage of it, since I don't have any friends that currently own the game, I'm sure it's probably very fun with a few buddies.Just playing by myself, I got bored very quickly.In my opinion, this game has one of the worst prolouges I've ever played. The story itself isn't very original either.This game has/had a ton of potential, but I just don't see it at the moment. I'll try it out on the Xbox One.4/10			"

												Big Game industry is full of hype. Don't believe what you see on the trailers, I tell ya! (..at least that's true in most cases)It's harder to know these days if the game is good or not. Many people get amped up by the hype of salesmans and their trailers with awesome music, superb graphics (which in many games  are from cutscenes and no actual gameplay) and all that stuff. Emotions sell. That has made me think a lot harder on what games to invest in.I thought about buying this game a couple of days, during which, I watched a lot of youtube early access videos, read some reviews and so on. And finally decided to buy it. I'm now very happy I did.Many times with big releases, there comes the feeling of money gone to waste. Not in this case. THIS GAME is, simply put, AWESOME!!Actually I can honestly say that it's the best racing game I've ever played. I really can't compare it to the good old racing games, because it's been so long. I was a hardcore carmageddon fan back when it was the new hot stuff. Also need for speed since the first game of the series, and enjoyed them very much with maybe one or two exceptions of the NFS series later releases. I also liked Flatout 1&2 very much and Gran Turismo 5 was my the only racing game on PS3 I played a lot. And thought bugbears new Next Car Game on PC looks good, it seems to be pretty much same the formula then Flatout2, just with minor upgrades and graphics upgraded ofc - nothing this major as we see on The Crew.I'm listing these just so that you know, what I'm rating this against, and what kind of driving games I usually enjoy.I haven't bumbed to games like that in a looong time and was starting to worry that they're gone extinct. Luckily my fears were unjustified. The Crew really delivers!The part I've read some critique is the phrase ""never drive alone"". Well, yeah, it's kinda true. There are lots of people online, but the time I've played, only one dude crewed up for a race without me asking first. But since I haven't been looking to form a crew yet, can't really complain about that. And I must say that the time flies with this game even if you play solo races. go exploring or just enjoy driving and leveling up. Also, it probably the launch is effecting to that too because I'd think that lots of people are busy leveling up their rides and exploring. And of course, people come and go and play at different times, on different timezone and so on.If you have 1-3 friends, who enjoy racing games and play a lot at similar times then you do, then think no further. I can't imagine how much fun this game can be if you play it with 1-3 IRL friends, with teamspeak ofc.Another thing, the world is HUGE. Also the terrain is done very well. Mountains feel like mountains. There are lots of racing tracks, like the legendary Pike's peak, some oval tracks and one of my favorite from Gran Turismo: Mazda's Laguna Seca raceway! And many others. You can naturally also go check Death Valley, Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon and so on.I've explored maybe 1/5 of the map in 12 hours, and I've done a lot of exploring during that time. If you think you might enjoy driving from coast to coast, it's going to take a long time to drive. Luckily there is an option to drop in at locations you've already been. Also it's possible to just take a plane and from NY to Las Vegas, and you're instantly teleported to the airport, if you don't care for joyriding cross the country.During the 12 hours I've played so far, the negative can be pretty much summed to the following:-Uplay.-3-4 server disconnects during 12 hours gameplay. But if they fix this, I think it's acceptable during the early stages. The server load must be huge. But still, it's a minus because company like Ubisoft should have the resources to host the game. Better to have some extra capacity going to waste during launch, then the other way around.-Uplay. I hate the fact that I have to run steam and Uplay at the same time-Some very minor bugs, that really haven't effected the gameplay, for me at least. The guide thingy that shows you where the waypoint is pointing, doesn't always follow the road. This happens rarely though and only with custom map markers. I also have to note that this has happened only couple times during my gameplay, and it's a very minor thing. I hope they fix it though.-Uplay. Steam doesn't show the people I've played with on uplay ofc, and every steam friend probably has different nickname on uplay. Makes connecting more complicated.-The cars feel a bit rigid/stiff and slow at start, but once you get to lvl10 or so - you'll get there fast - they start to show some character. 12 hours in and I'm near lvl20 though I've done lots of exploring. I would guess that the leveling gets slower though, when you get to higher levels. -Season pass/DLC. But this time it feels that I will be getting something for the money, unlike watch dogs for example. I of course don't like to spend 20€ for 12 cars and a bit of content, but as an OVERALL, I think this game is worth the combined price of the game + the season pass. And I can't think of another Ubisoft game I could say the same.-Car damage could have been done better, in my opinion. I don't know if it's me, but if you crash a car to a brick wall @ 300+ km/h, something should happen (other then the cosmetic fender flying off, and then we go again). Stuff that happened in Flatout2 for example. Wheels flying. Cars being torn apart. Driver flying through the window. That kind of stuff. Or something towards that. That's how I feel about this, others might disagree since it is more towards arcade game. Still, maybe they could have implemented a toggle switch for that for those players who want more car damage.-Cop cars sometimes way too overpowered. they will catch you with their normal cars weather you're driving on road or on corn field. Sometimes this makes very nice getaway races though, but more then half ot the time it's a bit ridiculous when you're going 280km/h and your car is like a huge magnet for cop car(s) to ram into.CONCLUSION: 9/10 (might change this as I get more time into the game, but for now)AFTERTHOUGHTS:Me being on steam for years, and this being the first review I've ever written should say something of this game.But to be absolutely clear: If you have ever liked racing games like NFS series, Flatout and racing in general and have the hardware to run this game, definitely buy this one. I was positively suprised how well my PC runs this game (a single GTX770,  Phenom II X4 940BE (3.5Ghz) cpu and 8gb RAM). And the settings are pretty high.PS. Sorry for typos and spelling errors, english not being my native language.			"

												Boring, braindead game. This game becomes extremely trivial once you upgrade your vehicle at least +50 from race requirement, and this isn't hard to do. Game can be completed with just your starter vehicle, there's hardly any incentive to buy  a new vehicle unless it's something that catches your eyes (and you can afford it) or its practical and covers all 5 Upgrades. You do not get a great sum of cash income at all. I've spent probably $4k (Crew Bucks) in total for cosmetic items like paint, bumpers and rims. By the time I finished the game I had 300K. Which can barely get you♥♥♥♥♥♥all. The Crew can easily be completed around 14Hrs if you just tunnel vision your way through story mode - While upgrading your vehicle on the go. Getting to max level (50) took me around about 10hrs. The Crew's story it self was trash. It's not interesting it makes barely any sense and it's really not worth paying attention to at all. You'll often be questioning the choices made by writers who wrote the story. The game does showcase key-parts to cities well, it isn't exactly to real size, however it does take in the important parts to places within USA. Performance wise, it ran well on my PC on high and with 60FPS cap on (Note you can apply this within game setting - initial install its locked on 30FPS). Sometimes frames dipped within motion blur and unnecessary police red. blue light flashing on border of screen, but majority of the time i had a solid 60. Honestly this game is decent at best, if you want a braindead game that can be slightly enjoyable and relaxing at times. But you will get bored easily. Main reasons i pressed No to recommend game as it felt incredibly empty, boring and overall did not fill my expectations when I saw trailer for this ages back. You will 90% time be on your own and rarely EVER come across anyone online. IF you ARE keen on buying this though, do recommend buying on sale - not at full price.			"

												Im extremely impressed and having a ton of fun. It's an arcadey, HUGE drving game with a ton of content and exploration. Think Need for Speed Underground 2 as an online game, and with a dozen or so more large cities, plus huge amounts of countryside, and races that can tank literally seconds (jump events) or hours. I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, hours. There is some rally events that can go upwards of 2 to 3 hours long.Graphics wont blow your mind, but its a small sacrifice for the sheer size of the game world, which has no loads btw. Runs smooth as hell for me and no lag yet. All in all I highly reccommend.			"

												This game panders to anyone who has never played a racing game in their life. Super arcade style physics. Like more arcade feeling than Need for Speed. You can be going 200+ miles an hour and handbrake drift around a 90 degree corner with great ease. Worse than that, hitting the wall and other players in corners actually makes you go FASTER than traditional braking. All the cars feel the same and have very similiar, if not identical handling. The handling of cars is very boring. They all feel like I am piloting a hovercraft that has better side to side movement rather than a car that takes turns and corners in lines. The controls are unresponsive to a point of feeling like a beta free-to-play game. The graphics look like they were built on an engine about 7 years old. The music is all whiney and or emo sounding alternative rock. The user base is very rude and anti-social. The story line is uttelry absurd and stolen from Need for Speed ""Most Wanted"". Unlocking items and upgrades for your car requires entirely too much time and effort. If the person you are racing crashes into traffic or rams into a corner it doesen't matter because they just use NOS to get back to speed. The game has a very juvenile vibe in general. The only saving throw this game has is a large open world to explore.			"

												As usual there are pros and cons in this game.Pros: - Good looking graphic- Very detailed environment and cars (the environment feels alive, even if you set it on low)- Great game mechanism (leveling up)- Very optimized game engine- Good on steering wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) Cons:- Not good on controller and keyboard (i thought this is an arcade game?)- Difficulty is a bit tough especially on the hit and run type of mission (not enjoying, more to stress)- You can't change difficulty- Some issues with connection, during car selection on the board the screen will freeze and lost connection (happened to me for now)(edit) - If you have max your level which is on level 50, you will not received any skill points. Instead you have to buy using crew credits (cc) if you don't have cc you need to buy it using real money. This is stupid.- The prize money you received in game is very little in amount, so you have to wait longer to buy lamborghini or ferrari but if you're impatient you have the option to buy crew credits in order to buy cars without waiting (to me this is a little bit unfair, because people have already paid for the game and you need to pay more in order to buy cars in-game because some people could not afford to buy the crew credits because they have spend it on the game itself)Overall verdict:I recommend this game to those who like cars and exploration type of game. Who enjoys playing with friends and strangers, competitive driving and enjoy site seeing in their dream car on a virtual world. The issue for me is that, the difficulty for this type of game is kinda difficult. It is suppose to be an arcade game, people supposed to enjoy not stress when doing story line missions (especially during the hit and run mission). The fact that you can't change the difficulty is stupid to me. It reminds me of Midnight Club Los Angeles, how hard it is to win races, you have to be focus and not able to enjoy it. It put my stress level high. The next thing is that you can't control the car properly on a straight line if you use controller or keyboard, it is utterly impossible to corner and keeping the car on a straight line. This is an arcade game, ivory tower should make the car controllable on any gaming peripherals (keyboards, controllers and steering wheels). I hope that they fix the control issue and also the difficulty settings, let the customer or user choose their own settings.(Edit) this is my second thoughts on this game 6/10 for me. I hate the internet connection issues. #0_24, #0_34, #0_1..i mean what the?. They should have fix these problems before launching the game. Apart these issues i have no problem.			"

												Think Need for Speed: Most Wanted combined with Fuel. Think Test Drive Unlimited combined with Driver: San Francisco. Think Need for Speed: World combined with Burnout Paradise. Think…ehh, you get the point. If any of the games I’ve listed so far tickle your fancy, or even combinations of them, then The Crew might be for you.The game has its quirks and its rough patches, but it is generally an alright game. The story is bland, the graphics could be a smidge better, the car handling takes time to get used to, and the claim that it’s an MMO is kind of false. I’m not saying the graphics are bad, they just have their moments of making me say “that could look better.” The car handling, at least for a 'keyboard racer,' works but feels somewhat odd. I've yet to try The Crew with a controller or steering wheel. At times I feel like I'm not in complete control of the car. Playing with all the assists off just made the game harder, not so much more enjoyable. I now play with all assists on because I'm already tapping the left and right arrow keys twenty times per second. Vehicle collision bugs me. Sometimes you'll tap a wall or car and bounce off unharmed. Other times you'll nudge the same entity and do a full 180 and come to a screeching halt. The AI of the other racers and police are painfully scripted. Cops have near infinite acceleration and top speed at times. Opponent racers haul♥♥♥♥♥off the line leaving you in the dust for a bit. And towards the end of a race, the AI ""gets tired"" and basically coasts for the remainder of the race, allowing you to finish first almost every time.Calling The Crew an MMO is incorrect. The roads aren’t full of other players. In fact, they’re almost completely void of other players. The Crew only ever boasts 8 players on the same map at once. If you’ve played other multiplayer racing games, I’m sure you’re used to the whole “drop-in, drop-out” system. Regardless, for most of the time I’ve played The Crew, I’ve generally been either completely alone in my own world or only paired with 1 or 2 other players. Players can invite others to do missions with them, but I’ve only ever received a handful of invites. It seems that with The Crew you either have friends to drive with or you don’t. But then again, I didn't buy it to mindlessly hang out with other players and talk smack about their iridescent paint jobs.But besides this, I find myself compelled to keep playing. The Crew combines open-world racing with some RPG elements. Grinding XP, car parts, and money is there. Oh, and numbers. So many numbers. The sheer amount of digits littering your screen upon completion of a challenge, race, or mission is a bit daunting. But as you do missions, you’ll level up your general level, as well as your car’s level. Thus, more numbers.Needless to say, I like The Crew. I’m sure not everyone will enjoy it. It definitely sets itself apart from other racing games, at least a little. I’m a fan of the customization, the leveling, the open-world, and the numbers (oh baby the numbers). It’s a game to keep an eye on to see where it goes, or maybe even what games spawn because of it and its ancestors. And if you still have a vendetta against Ubisoft after their previous releases, as in 99% of the people reading this, just know that this game actually works...though you will have to suffer because of the UPlay integration.

												I bought this game on sale expecting it to be similar to Test Drive Unlimited 2. The open world is indeed interesting, but all the other elements didn't impress me at all. The story was generic and I found myself bored in no time. All the cars handled very similarly. Didn't like the multiplayer either. Last time I've played this game I've searched for a PvP lobby for about 5 minutes and then I was presented with 3 other players all of which had upgraded cars and I've had no chance to win at all. No wonder Ubisoft are giving the game away for free for the whole month right now, the community is almost dead. I wouldn't recommend to buy this game, get it for free while you can if you want to check it out.			"

												This game I have to say is one of the best and most anticipated racing games I've come across thus far. It's nothing like iRacing or Assetto Corsa as in a simulation. This is a Need For Speed Underground 3 with a massive open world driving experience. The car customization is impressive. I started off with a Nissan and finished with a Ford Focus fully tuned with street and dirt specs. Doing challenges was a blast, reminds me of the old Trackmania days competing for a better score/time. Physics are great too. The better the parts you get make a noticable difference in the handling of the car. Not to mention the perks you get as you progress through the campaign. Racing with friends was a blast. The 4 of us beat the campaign, got our dirt tuned vehicles and went cross country up and over hills and into canyons. Traveling from Florida to Washington. From NY to LA. Took quite some time even doing 180+ most of the time with a few crashes. We ran into multiple players and ran them off the road (They were pretyty slow) xD The cosmetics are amazing. Back when NFSUG2 was the game to play, this is the baby of that. A big baby though. Years of research and development going into a large massive MMO racing game that has topped my expectations.			"

												Honestly I don't know what's all this hate for. Most of the people who reviewed this game either played 0.0000001 hours or didn't even bother solving the launch crash issue. If you actually spend a good 10 minutes searching for answers about your problems with the game, and follow the steps you are provided in posts about these issues it will run perfect, but guess that's too hard for ya. So now for the game review and not the stupid toxic community review:The map is massive, the variety of cars is very good and the customisation is amazing as well. Story mode is enjoyable but definitely not the best, but the map and online compensates for it. Graphics are very good considering the size of the map, though I think the weather changes way too often and and there's rain every 10 minutes. I personally like the physics though I'm not gonna touch on them because it depends on the type of physics you like. The game has a good photo mode and very good places for taking photos. So, do I recommend this game? Depends on the person you are, fortunately there is a demo, so you can see if you like the physics, graphics and if the game runs smoothly. The crew has three versions:Normal-29.99€Wild run edition-29.99€Complete edition-49.99€(it has all the dlcs) If you are debating on witch to get, get the wild run edition(if you are on a budget)  or the complete idition. Obviously you can wait for a sale to come, so when there's a sale definitely get the complete edition! Hope you found this useful!P.s(don't look at my hours, this is on my second account)			"

												The Crew is one of the most amazing racing games I have ever played the massive open world is just awesome and there is lots of stuff to explore. But once you reach level 50 and you played through the story it gets pretty boring, there are still faction mission and pvp but honestly it gets boring after a few races. But well it's still an awesome racing game and you can have hours of fun and if you don't rush through the campaign it will be fun much longer.			"

												Do I recommend this game?Yes, I had a lot of fun playing itWould I pay full price for it?No, wait until it's on sale. It's good and I enjoyed it, but not that much.Note: It's an arcade style game so I've judged it accordingly. IMO a lot of people are judging the car physics and handling etc like they would for simulators, but it is an arcade game so judge it on it's merits. For an arcade style game I think it does really well.Pros:- Fun single player: Combined the typical ""Need for Speed"" storyline elements with the GTA style open world roaming allowing you to pick and choose your missions- Co-op can be done on any missions, you can do everything on your own or with friends, you don't need to be alone for some missions or with friends for others- Graphics are great- Haven't encountered ANY issues with the game at all- Hidden cars are found by exploration and unlocking areas of the map, not just winning races and earning moneyCons:- Story Mode isn't very long, I've finished it in 18 hours and I didn't use quick travel at all so spent quite a long time driving to some missions- Limited selection of cars, possibly because they decided to make DLC but would've been better if they were available as part of the core game- Not many ""customisation options"" at all: This is for both car customisation and audio/graphics/display settings etc. There's really not that much at all compared to other PC games out there- Limited replayability: There are some bonus missions and ""skills""  and stuff for completionists to do but other than multiplayer with friends and a few longer missions, there's nothing really to do after you finish the game until more missions are released with the upcoming DLC next year, assuming you buy itOverall, I had fun playing it and would recommend you buy it too if you've enjoyed Need for Speed/Burnout style games in the past, then you'll likely enjoy this too. I would however wait until it is cheaper before purchasing it.			"

												完美的赛车游戏。有一整个美国供你探索，虽然肯定会有大量的缩减，毕竟才14G。但是现有的地图仍是我玩过的赛车游戏里面最大的。如果你没有X1，但是又想玩Forza Horizon 2.。那么毫无疑问这款游戏绝对是你的最佳之选。玩了8个小时了还在底特律城转悠。大量的任务，优秀的合作模式，排行榜，各种地标建筑，即使作为旅游指南都足够。一切的一切都让你不自觉投入大量时间。城市的刻画也非常到位，可以看到人，还有消防车，卡车，火车，总之地图做的非常精致。，比欧卡2丰富太多。当然两者本身投资肯定也不能比。。极其丰富的改车系统，虽然目前似乎只有10辆车提供给你改。不过每辆车都可以改成多种类型，以适应不同的赛事和跑道。新车型可能会在DLC里面再出，我已经有想买季票的冲动了！！剧情简单明了，作为赛车游戏已经算是描写最好的剧情了。担心UBISOFT服务器的同志们，反正我到现在就掉过一次线，能看到大量的其他玩家。至于别人愿不愿意和你COOP就是另外一回事了。。我到目前为止COOP过三次。。总之，目前来说这60刀花的非常值。还有大量优点需要你自己去感受了。我也说不完。。9.5/10.。0.5分扣给画面。。只能说这画面中等，算不上次时代的感觉。。不过大概画面上去优化又渣了。_(:з」∠)_。。所以这样也好，反正我一直车内视角。。			"

												Its not an MMO since only 7 people can play with you at the same time. The police are faster than they should be- using boost doesnt do anything when trying to escape. In missions where you have to destroy another car they're faster than you are. You're forced to use a specific class of car for each mission.There are only a few cars that can be used for each of the car classes.  Its a good game- the physics are pretty good, graphics aren't bad, and the map is immense but it isn't an mmo, the cops are faster than they should be, and you have limited freedom in choosing which car's to use for each mission.

												I've been looking for a racing game for PC for ages now. I've played most of the newest- attractive - racing games and honestly, I'm addicted. Grid Autosport was the most recent release that actually got me interested. I like the ""Circuit"" type of racing cause it reminds me of Gran Turismo 5, which I played for hours on end. I've bought Asseto Corsa, Grid 2, dropped $30 on RaceRoom Racing Experience, and nothing.Nothing caught my eye - I missed the Gran Turismo 5 style of racing game. Winning races, getting money, and then doing what YOU want with that money. Its the best system.A lot of racing games now are rewarded types where you win a certain amount of races and then it awards you with cars, which was frustrating.I doubted this game... a lot. I thought it was going to be a buggy, disgusting visuals, pay $60 for junk type of game... you know, like a lot of PC release titles recently.I watched a few videos and I decided to give it out, wanted to see how big the world is and such.I played 7 hours straight on release day.No crashesNo disconnectsNo bugs (That I've seen)This game is POLISHED. I LOVE IT. The world is absolutely massive and it never forces you to do certain things. I got my Skyline and drove from NY to LA, then to Miami. Not being forced to do tasks. It's perfect, being able to see other players, there car, seeing players FLY down street, drift, hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ its great. The campaign is long too, which is also great! It helps you become more attached to your car, and to save up for upgrades and for a new car. It keeps you interested, and for once, I actually feel like I'm playing a story. I mean really, a lot of games out there are too short to remember. 14-20 hr games? ... Typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've been playing the main story for hours on end and I dont feel remotely close to the end.When you have a game with a longer story, you become more involved in absolutely everything. I havent played a good game in a while that has a story thats long enough for me to immerse myself in it. Im not saying that this game has the best story, but it definitely beats A LOT of recent titles. Just because of its length, and how that length makes you become more involved with the story. A huge plus from what I've experienced.Graphics are awesome, they really are. The game runs INSANELY smooth on my SC GTX 780 and i5 3570K @3.4 GHZ. A lot of releases lately have had fps drops here and there even when there stable.I havent gotten one frame under 60 fps yet, even with the 60 fps lock on. Brilliant (Also because it looks better then a lot of recent games too)If you love cars and want to do what you want with them, get this game, it is ABSOLUTELY worth the $60. And don't go on metacritic for this for PC, its a bunch of winey PC Gamers that are constantly looking for an AMAZING game to come.Sorry, not happening. It may not be perfect, but its one of the very few games this year that has gotten my attention and has hooked me. Cant stop playing.10/10 - Racing games should be more like this and less like Grid and free games.			"

The main story is short, and the there are way too few faction race to go about playing this game any longer. The mini-tasks which will get you a bumbup on your car specs are kind of... meh.Out of 10, I'd give 6. Which is enough to get thumbs up.			"

												As an online arcade racer - this is fairly good. Not 'wow', but its worth buying on sale.As there are different specs (Street, Dirt, Raid, Performance and Circuit), the game covers more of the important ground of racing imo. People who love dirt and mountain climbs will like it, people who are just innit for the thrill of driving the fastest car down the highway will like it, and of course you have that 'standard' city race where the Mini's and Golf's are agile options.There's also abit of fun with the customization part with rims, colors, decals, bumpers - you name it.The downside is the physics where its almost impossible to land on the roof for instance. Or you just fly sky high hitting a rock at 10 km/h.Are you a racing-fan, then this is a game thats worth buying (wait for it to come on sale if you can), just for the sole purpose of the pvp-part.

												meh. tall price for a mediocre racing game. Overall the gameplay is adequate. Worth a go on a 60% or better discount. Underwhelmed with the entertainment value @ retail. ""Open World"" is a bit of a stretch...""linearly insistent open world"" is a more apt, yet euphemistic way of describing it. Like: car upgrades         dirt feature         JUMPS!         fast travel (once discovered.)          Overhead drive waypoint linemeh: predictability of an oncomig vehicle on nearly every blind corner or hill (lackluster)         Kart like rubberbanding!!!         ghost boulders that throw you into things         drivability of full stock cars         scenery (1920x1080 high settings on GTX760 OC)         inconsistency of drift physics         issues with CTD ""Display driver stopped and recovered""         redundant missions         Game load time (i5 2500K @ 4.2) FC4 loads quicker...Like I said: It's worth a go if Steam have one of their awesome sales of 60% or more off retail. There is fun to be had. Just not without some frustration.i5 2500K @ 4.2Asus GTX 760 OC Intel 250G SSD 16G G.Skill ripjaws			"

												You know, I understand The Crew is nothing special; however, I think it's still a good game. The microtransactions are there, yes, but to me at least, it's more fun to earn your keep rather than simply buy it. The driving seems solid enough to me, it is a bit lacking on cars if you don't get the DLC, but the ones that are there look very good and are fun to drive. I love the open world, it's beautiful and fun to drive around in and that's part of the reason I got this game. Admitably, I'm not hard to impress when it comes to racing games, but I do like this one just for the world and because I like racers in general. I would advise that if you do want to get it though, wait until a steam sale, not worth the full price.			"

												I don't know why people hate this game so much i mean i understand the owner of this game is from TDU but really stop hating it for no reason. I mean does forza have the power to open the door to your cars? Does NFS have that? The crew has good graphics cool racing game online  cool cars and more. Plus with the season pass it is better i bought the crew golf for 85$ and it was worth it the season pass is epic. This month i got a fiat 500 dodge viper srt 2013 and a epic aston v12 zagato plus when you activate it you got a mclaren mp4 and a ferrari 458 speciale. I know you have to wait for the cars to come but if you dont like it for that reason  You're impatient. The game has like one of the best graphics in cutseens.			"

												Do NOT waste your money on this hollow shell of a game. It's titles like this that move the title of ""greediest gaming company"" to other people than EA. Your initial $60 gets you a whopping 40 models of car, with somewhere between 1 and 5 tuning settings each. Then, you're forced to pay for any additional content they provide past ""updates"" for those first 40 cars. Now that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't waft all these extra rides in front of your face on every vehicle select screen, including the new car lot, making every completionist out there cringe. Oh, and the icing on the car cake? Your vinyls/liveries for your car are limited to whatever presets are available in the game, and some cost as much as a new car. Talk about limited customization!On top of all their swindling of your cash, the map is far from fleshed-out, with vast expanses of nothingness where only one relatively small subset of the vehicles in the game can get above 60mph. This makes the game feel very empty, and it's only compounded by only being able to see 7 other players (in an MMO, haha!) at a time in-world. The rest of the ""life"" in the game are NPC cars with little to no driving skill who will inevitable get in your way more often than not, NPC pedestrians with whom your only interaction is ""spooking"" them out of the way, and random furry critters that act suspiciously like the people.The story is short and will only take a day or two to finish for a decent player. The endgame content is lacking and the leaderboards are dominated by trainer-using cheaters, so you can give up your dream of being e-famous in this game.It really feels like I paid $60 for a very pretty but very empty tech demo. Despite desperately needing some games to play with new PC friends, I'd never recommend this thing to anyone.			"

												For an RPG/Driving game this is a decent game. In terms of execution... oh dear.Beefeing up your ride to twice that of the AI one would think you'd win easily, yeah, not so much. You can ONLY win if you wait for the script to let you win. Don't even think of overtaking cars with pure skill. You can drive like an asshat and win since the AI slows down and lets you win... right before the end. Or, you could drive like you're paid to do it... and loose since you had to break in the last curve. Lets get one thing straight, your skill as a driver has 0 impact wether or not you win races. All you have to do is to wait for the script to let you win. And that is even before the AI starts to cheat.Then there's the police...Going from 0 to 300 in one second - CHECKBreaking suddenyl in front of you at 300 kmh and taking no dmg nor moving whatsoever - CHECKTaking turns at breakneck speed without braking - CHECKdoing a 360 at full speed and then just continue in the opposite direction - CHECKBeing able to send you into a spin just by nudging your car - CHECKBeing able to do precise manouvers EVERY time without fail - CHECKBeing able to catch up to you when you drive the fastest most badass car in the game, and they sit in a ""normal"" car - CHECKBeing able to pass through other cars with nothing happening - CHECKIn short, the police in this game is not bothered with physics.It has potential, but without fixing a cheating AI and a godmode police... no, not worth getting			"

												The Crew is by far the best racing/free roam car game I have played in a long time. It's basically a Driver type game with more options and rpg (car mods, perks ect.) elements. You play as Alex, a racer who looks up to his older brother who's in a car club called the 510's. Anyway, some stuff goes down (not going to spoil anything) and you end up going to prison. You end up meeting an FBI agent who offers you a proposal you just can't refuse. From there, the game starts and let me tell you, I've been having a BLAST. The map on this game is HUGE! It took me 35 minutes to drive from NY, NY to L.A. That's insane if you ask me. This game offers tons of racing optoins as well. If you get bored with street, mod your car to race around in the dirt. The game is on sale right now and I would reccomend this to anyone who loves racing games!			"

												Well what can I say about this game really? At first I thought it was just the racing game I was looking for. But along the way I've learned that I really share a love hate relationship with this game. It seems that buggy have become the normal for Ubisoft this days, instead of releasing quality games like the goold old days. The game was marketed as a big open world full of people, but that's really not what I got. Instead what I find is that you're pretty much driving around alone, rarely running into other players. Check the map, in the demo video it was full of other players. Now that you've checked that one, check yours, you'll see a few people here and thereA couple of my biggest problems with this game, happen to be the AI and respawn systems in general. There are alot of times - too many to count actually - where after I crashed, when I was way ahead in first place, it respawned me in last place, 8 miles away from the other racers. Therefore meaning I had to spend atleast a good five minutes racing my way back to them. Next thing is the traffic. Just yesterday for example, a car came around a corner and just tapped mine, my car went flying into next year and registered as me crashing. Another issue that seems to happen alot is when I'm driving around the entire map, the roads tend to turn into rainbow colors, and I'm getting this ERROR_<something> on the top of my map, where the location information is supposed to be.Final bad thing about this game, lets get to that shall we? The ""ram this person"" or the overall raid missions. They're overly hard, ""frustrating"" as some people call it. Overly so if I do say myself.Now apart from the bad, there is the good. The story seems solid, and it is fun to be cruising around in my Skyline enjoying the scenery - just wish there was drifting in here. Why is there no drifting?!If you can look past the bad, get it, if not, don't get it.			"

												To start off, The Crew is an open world MMO racing game. I like exploring the open world of the usa. New york, LA, Las Vegas, Minami and much more. The graphics are pretty outstanding as you explore usa, roads, dirt and hills. This isn't going to be better than the NFS game. The phyics isn't too bad but it can ruin your race if your racing in very bumpy hill in a off road raid car.The only things I came arcoss was a huge bug. I hit a car and I flow me in 500 ft in the fly. I was like, wtf? Ramdom.So I would recommend this game for people who like to explore.			"

												This game has a lot of potential and a lot of hours to play!One of the Biggest maps for a PC game i've ever seen, good perfomance on low, mid and high end PCs and awesome graphics!Good tunner options and showing everything we dont see on need for speed.We can really enjoy driving in this game, the critic reviews is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, do not believe these reviews!Just some cons that i found: Bug for pressing Alt+Tab(when you return to the game, your mouse become stuck in one position until you restart the game)Less cars compared to Test Drive Unlimited 2, some cars engine sounds has the same sound.Too much cut-scenes when in trasition between locations, and an internet connection is required to play.(No Offline play)Based on all of this, i give 8 out of 10!But about the price, i recommend to buy with at least 30% off, the full price is too much for this game!P.S. I might change this review when new dlcs, patches and bug fixes comes out!			"

												The Crew has terrible driving mechanics, and cheap ways to extend the ""story"" missions as much as possible. The cars severely overcorrect, there is way too much drift even when driving at lower speeds, the acceleration and braking in every car is terrible, even with extensive upgrades, and it is impossible to make small adjustments when driving. Basically, everything that can go wrong in a driving game's mechanics has in The Crew. Add that to the frequent server down time, DRM, requirement of Uplay, and other cars in races being boosted even when you have much better parts than them, and this game is worth maybe $20, but even that's a stretch. The open world is nice, but when it's this hard to get around it, it makes an extensive map like this much less impressive. This is something I would expect from a new indie games company, not a large company like Ubisoft. Maybe they'll learn from having 3 large releases being terrible this year. If you're going to buy The Crew, wait until it's on sale for less than $20, and don't expect to get much out of the story missions, it's really only good for the open world exploration, and even then it's a stretch.

												An amazing game, beautiful for racing and free roaming but being Ubisoft it is over animated, you wouldn't expect any less with their assassin's creed history, would you? Still, a brilliant game & brilliant cut-out-scenes. The glitches do need to be fixed though, no matter what graphics card/processor you have you will always have lag due to the over-animation. I would still reccomend this game. 8/10			"

Why direct, because Steam does allow you the ability to even turn in a bug report on it and it could very well have something to do with when you buy the game from steam and they tell you you have to link your UBI account.There is a defect with the game trying to do the faction missions, that earn a lot of cash, that I cannot play because the game freezes. I have to alt tab out and use task manager to close the game, after driving for a half our of a 1 plus hour mission.I looked for help from steam but they only offer a refund, no help. I've submitted two request to UBI for help and no answer.Lets stop giving these damn game makers our hard earned money until they fix their crap they throw at us and then ignore our requests for help.Yes, I’ve run 3DMark tests on my expensive video card, cleared video memory, jumped through all the hoops to make sure it wasn’t my machine, it’s not.

												I thought The Crew is a great game. I will admit that it isn't  for everyone and i have a few complaints, like the lack of cities in the game, i would've liked to see Atlanta in there, which is where i live, but i digress. It is still very fulfilling to drive across the country and see all the major American sights. My last really good racing game was Midnight Club LA and that game was very frustrating, but extremely fun with friends. This game has a bit of a different feel, since there aren't any game types like there were in Midnight club (I realize they are completely different developers) but I would like to see Some gametypes implemented, like keep-away. But anyway, The Crew is addicting, And from a developer's standpoint, as i am, for a game of this scale, the graphics are pretty insane. The world is massive, but it still looks beautiful and runs very smoothly. Even the little things, like reflections no the cars. I see all these people complaining about visuals  and AI catching up to you. Firstly, what do you expect from the police? a cake walk? and secondly, It would be too easy without auto-catchup. I personally prefer a challenge. It's a good game, and I am optimistic for new features and DLC's. In the meantime, see you on the road.			"

												this games is highly recommended for anyone who liked the Test Drive Unlimited series or any fans of open world racing.  the gameplay makes up for its falws very easily but there are a lot of issues with the game as well.Pros- great graphics- fun gameplay- findable parts and spots make you want to exploreCons- limited car selection on base game* ( UBI made the last Driver game which I feel had a much better and larger car list than this game ) - no custom audio support *- map feels a bit small - storyline stolen from future fast and furious sequel- hidden car stolen directly from TDU2- map scaling and accuracy really bad ( seriously, they totally forgot about MN,IA,WI,NE,OK, etc. )*- no weather transitions ( I have only played the game for 3-4 hrs so this could change ).* this game was claimed by Ubi. to be a ""next generation open world racer"" and in my opinion these issues are not acceptable for next gen gamesOVERALL Its a fun game that will keep you entertained for hours and probably longer if you buy DLC.  This game feels less like a TDU3 and more like what TDU2 should have been.			"

												This game is awesome, I'm hooked. The launch it seems went off without any problems as far as I could tell and there was lots of people driving around. The way coop missions are done are pretty nice because you can send out a request to people in your general area. Also if your in a crew, they could be like off in a different city for example then start a cool co-op mission and it asks if you want to accept the mission and then you both just start it up seemlessly from wherever you happen to be. So when continuing missions, if you are like sidetracked at the car vendor, they can go on and drive to the next mission progression and start it up. Also, you can see your team mates like line in the sky showing where they are headed next (its shown on the map as well) so you can sorta instantly see if your both heading toward the next place.I'm not nearly covering all the different cool things but one more thing that really stood out to me. In all driving games before where you could explore a city such as grand theft auto for instance, its always been where you go in one direction and eventually you are going to hit a wall and have to make a right or a left then another right and another at the edges of the world. I must say, it was sorta of a weird sensation where I never hit that wall, I just could drive in one direction for a REALLY long time and never reach that invisible wall at the edge of the world. The scenery changes and all of a sudden I'm seeing new landmarks in the distance. Its quite a trip, of course there are eventual walls at the border of the USA but you literally would have to be on a mission to reach it. While just driving in one direction on like a 1 lane road I was also very surprised because quite often I would go through a mission start thing where all of a sudden I'm trying to get the most air off a jump or go as fast as possible for as long as I can staying on the road. It was like a total bonus to me just joy riding off into the sunset.Last thing, there is an option in settings to put refresh rate to 60 FPS. Boom, on Ultra graphics its gorgeous, not sure what some people were saying how it didn't look new gen, It does.Buy it, its worth it.			"

The game is well polished and fun but there are some aggravating bugs I hope the devs fix such as game crashing or disconnecting from Uplay just after completing a difficult mission.  It's more frequent as to be habitual at times.  It appears they are committed to the title though and the season pass has been worth the money.  Mutliplayer content is fun.			"

												This game is gender-confused. It's so lost and unfocused that it made me feel lost and unfocused. Every where you turn there's some power up or some challenge or some dodge the cops. Then there is some haphazard story to go along with it, a confusing interface as you can't even see what is the next logical race to do to progress with the story. Soundtrack is garbage; Test Drive Unlimited 2 had a great soundtrack. Don't even get me started about how bad this game runs. I can play GTAV like a dream and this game is a mess. Test Drive Unlimited 2 was much better. Another Ubi cash grab. DLC ads everywhere trying to get you to buy some car. I'd rather buy condoms. Garbage.			"

												This game is silly.  Physics are merely a suggestion.  Cars, even parked ones, will periodically float off into space for no apparent reason.  You vehicles can get sandwiched between an opponent and a wall and sent hurtling off in a random direction or fly through the map.  There is even one skill point where, if you attempted to do it in a certain direction, you WILL be sent off the map.  The AI sometimes breaks, and gets stuck trying to get to a checkpoint, or doesn't realize that it's missed a checkpoint and appears at the finish line doing doughnuts while waiting for you.  The game's story is the most cliche and stereotypical street racing story line that's featured in almost every movie and game on the subject.And it is glorious.There's a lot to do in the game.  Even more with the expansion pack.  (At the time of writing, Wild Run has been released, but not Calling All Units, which I am eagerly awaiting.)  Several races, including an up to almost four hours (in reality can be finished in around three) endurance race.  A few different game modes, including an annoying ""drive over the boxes"" mission type, or a few where you need to try to knock out another car.  Lots of pain jobs and ""stickers"" to apply to cars, as well as some visual customization (though some are quite lacking).  Unlocking everything can take quite some time, and some of the in-game achievements won't trigger properly.  There's PVP, and you can group up with three other friends to do the races and events together.  With the expansion pack you can set up your own races, and accept random stunts.This is not a serious racing game.  It's pretty arcadey with an open world.  But it is fun.  It's great to laugh at the game when it just goes wrong.  The races can be a lot of fun.  Even just driving around can be enjoyable.  Grab the game and a group of friends and just cruise around the USA.  See who can make the best, or worst, cars.  (No under-lights available, sadly.)  Compete with each other on skill points.  Just don't expect a Forza style realistic simulator.  Accept that this game is DUMB and embrace it, and you can have one of the more entertaining driving experiences out there.(Note: I played the game on Uplay for months before getting a complete version on Steam.)

												Nothing like it was originally advertised to be.  If you have any interest in driving for pleasure, look elsewhere.Cons:-Map feels small, due to constant scenery changes-Cars handle like ice skates-Framerate is heavily dependent on where you're driving-Crashes from time to time-If you crash your car in a race, you are respawned near the other AI drivers-In-game purchases everywhere-Racing is blandPros:-Gets you back into playing Test Drive Unlimited 2 againThe conclusion:Considering I could have bought both TDU2 and Euro Truck Simulator 2 for less than I originally paid for this, it was in no way worth it for me.  Even if this was on sale for 80% off, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Plus Noone ever realy gets online to play anymore. I got the game not long after it came out just so i could make friends and play together and nobody was online usualy except for me.So i do not recomend this game if you thought about buying it go use that money to buy Mad Max.

												Absolutly amazing. This game is the perfect in-between of GT and Forza. People have been compairing this game to Forza, but in reality they shouldnt because its totally different. Other racing games have been about one thing; race, win, upgrade, and repeat. But this game adds character that everyone has been craving in a racing game. The social racing style gamepaly is incredible to say the least. Example: I pulled up to another driver and reved my engine a little and we both did a burnout and drag raced to the end of the Vegas Strip. Afterwards I flashed my lights and he flashed back and we took off. Do I know that person? Will I ever see him again? No and probably not. But it was insanly fun none the less. Now on to the pros and cons because there are actually quite a lot of both. Pros:1. The open world (probably the games best feature to be honest) is to say the least HUGE. But is also deatailed very very well. 2. The Customization is also very detailed and expansive. 3. Social Interactions and ease of joining friends. Very very easy to join friends. 4. Very little to no delay or lag. When playing with friends its not like TDU2 where you see someone teleporting next to you (Ah the memories). Its to say the least almost seamless even at high speeds. 5. The little need to spend real money on crew credits. I made enough in one day to buy the La Ferrari. Its easy but no OP easy. 6. The graphics on the cars and people. I would give the graphics on the cars a 9/10 for the exterior, and a 8.6/10 for the interior. The people on the other hand are easily 10/10. Cons: 1. The relativly small number of cars in the game is quite frankly annoying. When you compare to other games its very small. My view on this will probably change with the DLC coming out next month. 2. Missing specs: now this is really really annoying to me. Not because there are missing specs. Its that you can still race against those specs in races. If your going to pull specs then pull them completely. Not just from players.  3. Level cap of 50. I got to 50 in 3 days. If its that easy you should have a level cap of 150. That would take a lot longer. 4. You can't sell cars. Now come on Ivory Tower, I know theres some old TDU devs in there. 5. Barley any cosmetic tuning on the raid and circuit specs. You cant tune any of the body work besides wheels and color on those 2 specs. I can understand the circuit spec (not wanting to misrepresent car companies), but raid? 6. Broken car level system with AI. The rubberbanding (When they slow down when your behind and instantly catch up when your ahead) in insane when doing non story AI races. Wheres the logic when a level 800 circuit spec can catch a level 1128 circuit spec easily? To top this review off even with those cons, this game is still absolutly stunning. If I could go back and preorder it over again, I would do it in a heartbeat. The last time I had this much fun in an open world game was probably skyrim. Its amazing where your on the top of a mountian or in a city and see something far in the distance and you can say ""I can drive there"". Good job Ivory Tower and good job Ubisoft. My final score for this game is 9.7 out of 10.			"

												Worst racing game experience I've had since the old need for speeds, which is what this feels like, except not as fun. Low quality graphics that remind me of early 360 games, and absolutely god awful car handling. The cars don't ever feel like they are going fast or you are pushing the limits like in other games like forza, the ""drifting"" is unrealistic and feels like an attempt at the need for speed style of drifting, but its not as refined or fun. You touch one corner, wall, or car and you lose control and the race. This is my least favorite type of racing game because the entire goal of the game is not to crash, not to actually race. There is no skill at all envolved in the racing like finding a line or going as fast as possible, the only objective when playing this game is to avoid the crashing AI morons in front of you, the traffic that doesn't avoid the massive amount of cars heading down the road, or the trees that come up fast because of the terrible handling. This game was Ubisoft's attempt to make a Need for Speed style game for the next gens, and it is a failure. I know I sound like a NFS fanboy, but I hate that series and the best way to describe this is as an outdated, terrible version of need for speed.			"

												The Crew serves a great concept for a Simulator, Racing and Open World MMO at the same time. But, that's only it - a great concept. Good graphics. Not as resource efficient as other games. Amazing map.What went wrong though?Well, the game itself is enjoyable.. in the first 10 missions. After a point, the feeling gets too repetitive, up to a point where the player, me at least, isn't motivated to keep on playing. The game is a little bit pay2win, in my opinion. Bugs still exist.Verdict: Meh. I mean mind you, if you like open world games and racing, etc, you can try it for yourself, but unfortunately, for me it's a no go. 4/10.And yes, the story and feel plays a big role.			"

												This game is really cool and I like it. Gameplay is awesome driving is harder but if you play it for a while you will get used to it. This game is buggy but it's just beta people i met are good they will not drive into you and ruin your car. Bad thing is 30fps cap but it doen't looks like 30fps it looks like 100or something around that even weaker PCs can run it pretty good. Story in this game is stupid you get out of jail and you have to find someone and get him absolutly stupid.pros+Graphics+Animals+Car customization+ giant and open world+co-op/multiplayer+Chicago is better then Watch_Dogs Chicagoand more...cons-physic-cars are too shiny-pay 2 win curency-30fps cap-storyOverall it's pretty good game 30fps cap will be changed you can see it in settings but you can change it by yourself. It has alot bugs and you can't get many cars just 20 (i think) but that's just in beta. You have lvl cap 10 but it will get higher with releas of this game. With P2W curency you can't buy anything OP like super fast car you can just buy normal cars and parts with it.It's good game 6/10			"

												I got into the beta, I put some hours into it too. So once again I'll give a Pro and Con list.Pro's: - MMO aren't usually my thing but something is just satisfying about ramming people off the road- It feels like a new idea I love it- Tons of Cars- Randomly Awesome Effects- Ubisoft didn't screw up on OptimizationCon's:- The Map leaves out some cool place that would be fun to explore (It bases 3 Important cities in a region)- The Beta World just felt empty (i'm sure this will be fixed when its released)- Map is kind've small (I know, Small!?!?! But it really isn't the size many people expect)- Needs some kind of Mini Games (not the small events)- Remove Crew Points, I can see this going really bad- Cars aren't very customizable- Perks are very limitedNeutral:- Well Worth my $60- No Monthly Subscription - Decent Story- It was a GREAT beta, Thank you Dev's			"

												I am not into Car racing games and have only ever owned Gran Torismo 5 for the PS3, I bought the racing wheel that goes with the game and played it for about 20 hours total before it sat and collected dust. My buddy talked me into getting The Crew and I haven't regretted the purchase 1 single second. The racing wheel plugged right into my PC and works like a charm on the game. I would recommend anyone who buys this go and get yourself a racing wheel with the game, it makes the game so much more enjoyable but it works fine without the wheel. The game can only get better by launch. Srsly, get this game!			"

I was in need of another racing game...For a few moments, Test Drive Unlimited 1 and 2 along with Midnight Club 3 and L.A. kept me entertained... and then there was nothing...But look no further!

												It's fufill everyone's hopes for this game (pretty much) and the graphics and the gameplay is nice and fun. The Optimization for custom kits is a very intresting concept which haven't been tried in most other racing games. The negatives would be glitchy physics (I drove off a cliff and when you flip in autokills you in midair) and rocks seem to act as terrain and fling you off if you run at them.			"

												I'm just here to complain about the dumb keybinds: if you want to use a gamepad controller, and you want to change controls so you can use a manual gearbox, or just change keybinds around, well, you simply can't. The game will only swap controls, so you'll end up with a ♥♥♥♥ed up control scheme after changing 3 bindings. Also, the game doesn't let you get rid of useless♥♥♥♥♥♥you don't need to have on a controller, like a button to see your friends or a button to activate missions when you can do that from the map or the controller start button, or, maybe one of the 4135643513 keys on the keyboard sitting in front of you (Remember this is a pc game? I don't think the devs did).  After dicking around in the menu for 20 minutes you'll think you're all set and start a race, turn a corner, hit the button you bound to look behind you, but instead downshift, hit your handbrake, set off your nitrous, blow the welds on the intake manifold, remove your brake calipers like the white Jetta in Fast and Furious, yell ""MONICA!!!!!!"", pop a wheelie, say a remembrance prayer for Paul Walker, and lose the race.  If you hold it down, it'll teleport you to New Orleans and put in a reservation for you at Bubba Gump's Shrimp Company. If you want to change the asinine keybinds on this game, run forrest, run the hell away.			"

												UPDATE: The game is an absolute desert right now, It fails as a multiplayer-only game, it fails as a co-op game and it absolutely fails as a MMO. This game will be dead before the end of 2015, although the fact that only 5.000 people were playin this game on a saturday night tells me that this game is DOA.What a shame, this game could have been amazing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game was already good in BETA, but now that it's finally out I have to say that ubisoft has delivered, I admit that due to recent events (ACU) my expectations were very low, but still, the game has improved considerably from the beta and in all the right areas, handling has received a major upgrade, graphics are good (for a MMO) and the game is running very smoothly.Reviewing a MMO is a very difficult and in some ways unfair since these kinds of games tend to be improved upon with time, however as of right now, the game deserves praise IMO, If you loved the old NFS games like NFSU 1 & 2 and the 2005 version of NFSMW (the greatest racing game of all time), then this game is for you.Score: 6/10.

												*BETA Review* *spent most my time playing from Uplay*I would recomend this game to people who are looking for a good time NOT people who are looking for something realistic. The game has a pretty cool storyline(from what I have been able to play) and very nice graphics(allthough I couldn't play max as my computer is not that great). Lists of pros and cons can  be found belowPROS:1. In depth customizing of cars2. Cool story3. Nice graphics even on low4. Open World US map5. Many cool places to visit6. *In Future* Import music to game(as of second beta Agust 25th-29th 2014)7. Voice chat with other playersCONS:1. Unrealistic map (not very accurate to the actual shape of areas. ex west coast is 1/3 of the west half of the US, texas is practically half way across the map from where it should be)2. Non-realistic handling(cars slide too much)3. No offline mode. Wish I could play without wifi4. Crew only suports 4 people.5. Voice chat is all languages. No separate chanels for english, japanese, arabic, ect.6. Voice chat sounds poorly. Either too loud to too soft. bad quallity.(had my friend do a comparison with me. He said it sounded horrible on the crew vs skype)Overall:Nice game with lots of room to play with. Could have better handling but I don't think this was ment to be a sim. Loved the cars, as each has its own strenghts, and weaknesses. Very cool visual upgrades(my dirt spec Nissan 370Z had some cool hill climb looking parts). The only thing I would have wished for is some late model cars. Not just the newest 370z or the 1967 Mustang. It would have been nice to see a 1999 Viper in beta. I know they had the 2002 Skyline GTR R34 but thats a common car in these games.Overall Loved it. Could it be better? Yes. Hoping for improvements for November? Definitely			"

												The Crew is a fun racing game and has a good online experience -when it works-. The controls are good, they manage to feel responsive under the arcadish style of the game. Each upgrade does have an impact on the car's handling. This is not a driving simulation game, i don't know what was the popular belief in the game but i never seen it as a driving simulator type of game. The way the cars feel reminds me instantly of the old need for speed series, which is something nostalgic and fun. Progression through the game will allow you to unlock different specs for your cars, being able to tune up your favorite ride with up to 5 different specs: Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid,  Circuit. Each spec has an immediate impact on the car's handling.The story is not the most ingaging one though is not too tone down to be silly or childish. Its just there for you to follow. The AI feels cheap, which can sometimes ruin part of the experience. You can indeed outrun them and get some nice distance as long as your driving skills are up to par, but they still somehow manage to keep up a speed that their cars shouldn't be able to have. Not sure if this is working as they intended or a bug, but it would be better if they didn't use cheap tactics to make it ""challenging"". The cop AI is -okay-. It sure makes me chuckle when i run inches away from a cop at 180mi in a 50 zone and they don't seem to give a damn, but then again, if they actually had to chase people for every time they are speeding the game would become unbearable. Its not hard to escape the cops, but its not an easy task at first. Once you get the hang of it you will be able to lose them easy, especially inside cities, or you could always go rampage and try to shut them down. So far, the only way to have the police chase you is by breaking things, crashing into other cars or the police itself. A small destruction bar will fill up and once its max the chase starts, or if you break things right in front of the cops, that sometimes also triggers the chase. Day to night cycle is highly welcome making the world quite beautiful. I've been stopping several times just to admire the view and take screenshots left and right. The entire presentation of the game's world is quite good. I gotten no texture pop ups so i've been able to enjoy every detail without problems. Some landmark views are just way too good to miss. If you are into these type of exploration, then the game has plenty of areas to go just to get a cool view of things. Exploration is encouraged, be it either for the view or to find abandoned car pieces / antennas. Antennas work like Far Cry's antennas or Watch Dogs CToS, once found they will display all side missions around that specific area plus they will also allow you to fast travel (though about this i am not 100% sure cause at times i could fast travel to locations where antennas were not activated yet). You can use trains or airports to travel from the different locations, this can help at times especially if you are in a hurry and want to go to a specific part of the map that you haven't explore yet, as fast travel won't work on locations you haven't visited. Car and player customization is minimum. I think for a racing game of this caliber, its a shame it has so little to offer. For colors, you are only allowed to change the whole body and only with preset colors for official/metallic/iridescent, there is no color palette. Another lacking thing is the fact that you can only place one sticker on the car, and i can't seem to change the color which makes it almost impossible to bond with your ride. You can modify the front bumper, the interior of the car, hood, spoiler, rear bumper, side mirrors, and the side of the car though i haven't found any car that allows me to change that area in particular. As for player upgrades, the HQ has perks for you to increase that will grant different bonuses.Each mission and side mission will grant you a car piece that directly affects on the performance of your ride. The better you rank in the mission, the higher the upgrade will be, ranking from Bronze to Silver to Gold. Self explanatory, bronze is the minimum upgrade, silver is the medium and gold is the best upgrade. Each car piece comes with a specific bonus (acceleration, top speed, grip or breaks) Every car piece you get is ""car-bounded"" though the piece will go to your garage, if you want to place that upgrade on another car you will have to pay a small fee. Though if i am correct, the car pieces are only usable with other cars as long as they share the same spec (Race, Dirt, Raid, Perf, Circuit), so if you finished the mission or side mission with a street car, the piece will only work for those specific cars. Upon leveling up you will be given the option to purchase pre-build kits that will instantly upgrade your car. The first kit you get it at level 10, the second one at 20 and so on. This kits are barebones generally level 10 or 20 (depending on the level of the unlock) bronze pieces, but it does help speed up things if you don't want to go through the trouble of racing every mission or side missions again. Every 5 levels the overall performance of every car you own will get a boost.The damage on impact is nice to watch, though the autoregeneration of the car is a bit puzzling. Not sure who's idea was but its strange to see the car going all wolverine on you and shaking off the VISUAL damage. The damage done to the car won't affect the performance on your car though it will affect the life of it, causing you to eventually head back to your HQ to repair your car is the life on your car is low. Same as damage, you car can be covered in dirt and snow but it will wipe off the moment you hit the road.Pairing up with friends is what the game was meant for, and sadly this is were the main problems shows up. Making up a crew with your friends can make progress easier, though the sole act of crewing up with your friends can prove to be frustrating. Connectivity issues, unable to join crews, made this particular experience tedious to no end. For some reason the 4th member, will somehow always find a way to not work and when it does, you might be able to run some missions before you get dc'ed from the servers. The game seems to eat a whole lot of bandwith, so slow connections might have a tough time playing the game with friends. Upon reaching level 10 you will be given the option to choose a faction out of 4. This will enable PVP missions and PVE, and also a type of ""salary"" that will increase base on your performance.Overall, despite of connectivity issues, the game is fun. Its not the mmo experience it was advertised but what you get is not bad either. Its hard to recommend it unless you are into exploration and have the patience enough to go through the connection issues. When it works, its a really fun game. If you are in doubt, i would suggest to wait a bit longer, maybe a price drop. For racing enthusiasts, the gameplay might be  too arcadish, but its still fun. "

The story line is just the beginning; if you are a competetive person you will not be let down. Every little thing you do is ranked including pvp races, skill missions, faction races etc.			"

Have you ever raced from the Super-Dome to Met-life Stadium? Or driven from Seattle to Miami without stopping, just because you could?I love that you can also do almost every Mission as a 4-Play Co-Op,This is the biggest surprise game is years! It is not just a great racing game, It is an all around great game!

Plus Noone ever realy gets online to play anymore.

												9.9/10 Pure awesomeness.I'm not into driving games, infact I haven't really played a driving game since Need For Speed Most Wanted on the PS2. I decided to grab the gold edition of this game because I had some extra steam credit, and god it was worth it. The driving feels really nice, and there are a couple cool types of races. There are regular street races, off road races, and raid races where you try to destroy/damage the opponent's vehicle by ramming into them. The MMO aspects of the game are awesome, It's cool seeing 10 to 15 (you can only usually see around 10 people in one city, and driving around you'll come across different players) driving in the same area as you. The graphics are very nice, and the game runs pretty smoothly. (I play at Max Settings/1080p/50-60fps depending on location. Consoles apparently run it at the same but at locked 30fps.) The map is also massive. I drove from Michigan to Tennessee to Georgia to Florida, seeing cities like Detroit, Nashville, Atlanta, Miami, and other various small towns you can encounter in the countryside. You can literally go across the entire US. (It took me 10 minutes to go from Detroit to Nashville, so I'm assuming it'd be about an hour or so to drive from east coast to west coat and vice versa.) The Crew aspect which makes the game unique is also very fun. You can team up with random players or your friends and race or do missions. Overall, It's extremely fun, and It really suprised me since I'm not a big racing/driving game fan.TL;DR buy this game, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												Heres what you should know about The Crew:TuningThe Tuning Garage is more of a bolt on parts shop. You dont actually tune anything. You select a part and put it on. These parts are unlocked through races and events. I was a bit let down on the whole 'tune your car' thing, since you arent really tuning your car. Customization:There are lots of colors and vinyls to choose from, but it feels lacking in the customization department. Again, a letdown. Yeah, its got body mods and stuff, but it fails to meet expectations set by NFSU2. For instance, you can pick a wide array of stripes, but not choose their color. Multiplayer:This is NOT an MMO. Yes, there are thousands of people online. However, you will only see a few at a time. At no point will you ever see 100 other drivers at the same time. Ive seen a few people, and we have largely ignored each other. 7 other drivers is the maximum it will ever show you at once. They wont always be the samer drivers, but that it the limit. Thus far Ive done everything alone, though Im still pretty new to the whole thing. Now, the game is fun. Especially with a wheel, pedals and H shifter. They will require about 1/2 hour of tweaking to get just right - but its very enjoyable when done. People said not to use manual and hardcore driving assist (which is zero assists such as traction control and stability) but quite honestly, I find this the best way to drive. Granted, I have just under 20 years driving experience and have had my fair share of street and drag races IRL. Manual transmissions are natural to me. The vehicles simply act slightly more natural with everything off. I think the visceral experience of shifting and turning a wheel really add to the experience...Im not even sure Id enjoy the game half as much without it based on the lack of customization available. The game's storyline plays out like a cheap ripoff of a FF movie. Given the arcadey nature of the game, thats ok with me. Cheese is good sometimes. There are tons of short mini games involved such as hitting as many targets as you can, jumps, 'go fast and stay  on the road' races and such. There are plenty of odds and ends to keep you busy for quite some time if you are a completionist. The races and storyline events can be tough, requiring a few shots at it to learn the track before a victory can be eked out most of the time. My most major complaint is the lack of actual tuning and customization. Everything else seems to work as it should at this point. After some hours of trial and error, I have the steering wheel decent enough to handle the game and feel pretty ok with it. Its not perfect by any means, but serviceable. If you want a game with a storyline like a bad Fast & Furious movie, driving style along the veins of NFSU 2, and just a [fair] bit of customization, this might be what you are looking for. If you're looking for realistic handling, deep customization, in depth tuning, and a more serious/sim style experience, this game is not for you. It has none of those things. Im going with Recommended because its not super broken out of the box. Everything works, its fun, but its still a bit of a letdown. I was hoping for real tuning and deeper options for customizing your ride.8/10			"

												pros:- big♥♥♥♥♥map.- 5 hidden cars 4 hotrods and a buggy (20 hidden wrecks for each).- can fast travel to discovered areas if you cant be bothered driving.- the cars handle like real cars.- a good looking cockpit view.- decent car customization.cons:- cant change rim size- cant change colour of rims (each style of rim has chrome, black, white and gold variants).- car colours are presets (cant adjust to a specific shade).- heavy traffic always appears at the worst time.- traffic also likes to show up at corners when doing intense checkpoint runs.- ♥♥♥♥ traffic.- needs better variety of cars.- checkpoint runs are probably the most frustrating thing in this game i ended up throwing my controller and chair across the room because of one. i was really excited when they first announced this game because it was the racing game i had been dreaming of for so long, an open world racing game with nfs underground style customization and a large variety of cars but as of right now i feel let down and betrayed, i recommend this game because in the end its still a decent game			"

												Positive+ Huge map with tons of activities+ Car handling is awesome (if you like acarde racers)+ MMO, PVP, and COOP+ Story. It may not be the best but it's good for racing game standards+ Car selection and customisation.+ Variety of racesNegative- Wolds fastest tanks are police cars making chases the most frustrating thing ever (NFS did ths so much better)- Takedown tagets can be ridicoulusly fast.- AI cars are not slowed for hitting destructable objects like fences, but the player is- AI cars are not affected by bad road condtions, i.e. they don't slide on icy roads- very inaccurate collision detection for trafic and solid world objects- Always Online- Earning patinum parts requieres luck due to trafic7/10			"

												9.9/10 Pure awesomeness.I'm not into driving games, infact I haven't really played a driving game since Need For Speed Most Wanted on the PS2. I decided to grab the gold edition of this game because I had some extra steam credit, and god it was worth it. The driving feels really nice, and there are a couple cool types of races. There are regular street races, off road races, and raid races where you try to destroy/damage the opponent's vehicle by ramming into them. The MMO aspects of the game are awesome, It's cool seeing 10 to 15 (you can only usually see around 10 people in one city, and driving around you'll come across different players) driving in the same area as you. The graphics are very nice, and the game runs pretty smoothly. (I play at Max Settings/1080p/50-60fps depending on location. Consoles apparently run it at the same but at locked 30fps.) The map is also massive. I drove from Michigan to Tennessee to Georgia to Florida, seeing cities like Detroit, Nashville, Atlanta, Miami, and other various small towns you can encounter in the countryside. You can literally go across the entire US. (It took me 10 minutes to go from Detroit to Nashville, so I'm assuming it'd be about an hour or so to drive from east coast to west coat and vice versa.) The Crew aspect which makes the game unique is also very fun. You can team up with random players or your friends and race or do missions. Overall, It's extremely fun, and It really suprised me since I'm not a big racing/driving game fan.TL;DR buy this game, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												First off I would like to say, I have more experince with this game then alot of reviews I have seen, I was a beta tester after all. Here is what you get, a large, open, racing game that takes place in the USA. While not a perfect replica, most major reconizable areas are present, graphics are very good. The content can be realistically beaten in a couple of days if you just run and gun the story. However there is unlimited potential for VS, CoOp and Leaderboard *friend and worldwide*. I will now address some of the falsehoods posted in a few reviews. Getting a crew, and doing CoOp is very much possible, however, I think it is reigon locked, as I seem to be unable to connect to European players and vice versa, for example. There are quite a few people playing, but depends on when you play, like any game, work, school, social events will flux the population. The game is NOT locked at 30 FPS. This USED to be true in the beta, but if you actually enter your settings for the game, you will see the option to ""frame limit"" to 60. Now in my personal oppinion, 60 is bare minimum for an acceptable PC frame rate, I run a 120HZ monitor and that nothing new to the PC, so I do expect PC relases to hit 60+ without fail. Also, remember, when assessing a game, if you have bare minimum specs, your experince will be drastically different from a high spec machine, so do remember that when publically reviewing.Now some Server stability, there have been issues here, mostly in the midday/late morning, they are not terrible, but for sure more frequant then deiserable, I suspect this will clear up soon. Uplay is almost useless for this game, now I am not a fan of it to start with, but it litterally tells you it is going to use steam to launch the application, if you launch from uplay. Good grief Ubi, just retire Uplay already.Thats it for this review, anything else I have to say about it is purely my personal oppinion and has nothing of relivence for the game.			"

												This hit the spot for me. Ive been wishing Midnight Club L.A would get put on steam these last couple months, and dayum! this game was perfect.

												Heres what you should know about The Crew:TuningThe Tuning Garage is more of a bolt on parts shop. You dont actually tune anything. You select a part and put it on. These parts are unlocked through races and events. I was a bit let down on the whole 'tune your car' thing, since you arent really tuning your car. Customization:There are lots of colors and vinyls to choose from, but it feels lacking in the customization department. Again, a letdown. Yeah, its got body mods and stuff, but it fails to meet expectations set by NFSU2. For instance, you can pick a wide array of stripes, but not choose their color. Multiplayer:This is NOT an MMO. Yes, there are thousands of people online. However, you will only see a few at a time. At no point will you ever see 100 other drivers at the same time. Ive seen a few people, and we have largely ignored each other. 7 other drivers is the maximum it will ever show you at once. They wont always be the samer drivers, but that it the limit. Thus far Ive done everything alone, though Im still pretty new to the whole thing. Now, the game is fun. Especially with a wheel, pedals and H shifter. They will require about 1/2 hour of tweaking to get just right - but its very enjoyable when done. People said not to use manual and hardcore driving assist (which is zero assists such as traction control and stability) but quite honestly, I find this the best way to drive. Granted, I have just under 20 years driving experience and have had my fair share of street and drag races IRL. Manual transmissions are natural to me. The vehicles simply act slightly more natural with everything off. I think the visceral experience of shifting and turning a wheel really add to the experience...Im not even sure Id enjoy the game half as much without it based on the lack of customization available. The game's storyline plays out like a cheap ripoff of a FF movie. Given the arcadey nature of the game, thats ok with me. Cheese is good sometimes. There are tons of short mini games involved such as hitting as many targets as you can, jumps, 'go fast and stay  on the road' races and such. There are plenty of odds and ends to keep you busy for quite some time if you are a completionist. The races and storyline events can be tough, requiring a few shots at it to learn the track before a victory can be eked out most of the time. My most major complaint is the lack of actual tuning and customization. Everything else seems to work as it should at this point. After some hours of trial and error, I have the steering wheel decent enough to handle the game and feel pretty ok with it. Its not perfect by any means, but serviceable. If you want a game with a storyline like a bad Fast & Furious movie, driving style along the veins of NFSU 2, and just a [fair] bit of customization, this might be what you are looking for. If you're looking for realistic handling, deep customization, in depth tuning, and a more serious/sim style experience, this game is not for you. It has none of those things. Im going with Recommended because its not super broken out of the box. Everything works, its fun, but its still a bit of a letdown. I was hoping for real tuning and deeper options for customizing your ride.8/10			"

												So... this game has been out for over 2 yrs now and Ubisoft has a bug that causes the game to stop rendering the open world and stops players in their tracks that try to drive through these unrendered spots. Ive contacted Ubisoft talked with Claire and another tech to find out Claire is the boss lady and after 2 yrs of a known issue nobody at Ubisoft can figure out how to solve this problem. If you wanna play the crew i would suggest stay away from the PC version and suffer with the console versions only cuz Ubisoft doesnt know how to fix their own problems in the PC world.			"

												I have had this game for about a year and am now doing a review for some odd reason. I first wanted this game to play with lots of other people online and have fun. but the only major fun part in this game is the story which you can beat so quickly its not even funny.The game is fantastic but short and exspensive. Plus Noone ever realy gets online to play anymore. I got the game not long after it came out just so i could make friends and play together and nobody was online usualy except for me.So i do not recomend this game if you thought about buying it go use that money to buy Mad Max.

Posted: December 9, 2014
												Absolutly amazing. This game is the perfect in-between of GT and Forza. People have been compairing this game to Forza, but in reality they shouldnt because its totally different. Other racing games have been about one thing; race, win, upgrade, and repeat. But this game adds character that everyone has been craving in a racing game. The social racing style gamepaly is incredible to say the least. Example: I pulled up to another driver and reved my engine a little and we both did a burnout and drag raced to the end of the Vegas Strip. Afterwards I flashed my lights and he flashed back and we took off. Do I know that person? Will I ever see him again? No and probably not. But it was insanly fun none the less. Now on to the pros and cons because there are actually quite a lot of both. Pros:1. The open world (probably the games best feature to be honest) is to say the least HUGE. But is also deatailed very very well. 2. The Customization is also very detailed and expansive. 3. Social Interactions and ease of joining friends. Very very easy to join friends. 4. Very little to no delay or lag. When playing with friends its not like TDU2 where you see someone teleporting next to you (Ah the memories). Its to say the least almost seamless even at high speeds. 5. The little need to spend real money on crew credits. I made enough in one day to buy the La Ferrari. Its easy but no OP easy. 6. The graphics on the cars and people. I would give the graphics on the cars a 9/10 for the exterior, and a 8.6/10 for the interior. The people on the other hand are easily 10/10. Cons: 1. The relativly small number of cars in the game is quite frankly annoying. When you compare to other games its very small. My view on this will probably change with the DLC coming out next month. 2. Missing specs: now this is really really annoying to me. Not because there are missing specs. Its that you can still race against those specs in races. If your going to pull specs then pull them completely. Not just from players.  3. Level cap of 50. I got to 50 in 3 days. If its that easy you should have a level cap of 150. That would take a lot longer. 4. You can't sell cars. Now come on Ivory Tower, I know theres some old TDU devs in there. 5. Barley any cosmetic tuning on the raid and circuit specs. You cant tune any of the body work besides wheels and color on those 2 specs. I can understand the circuit spec (not wanting to misrepresent car companies), but raid? 6. Broken car level system with AI. The rubberbanding (When they slow down when your behind and instantly catch up when your ahead) in insane when doing non story AI races. Wheres the logic when a level 800 circuit spec can catch a level 1128 circuit spec easily? To top this review off even with those cons, this game is still absolutly stunning. If I could go back and preorder it over again, I would do it in a heartbeat. The last time I had this much fun in an open world game was probably skyrim. Its amazing where your on the top of a mountian or in a city and see something far in the distance and you can say ""I can drive there"". Good job Ivory Tower and good job Ubisoft. My final score for this game is 9.7 out of 10.			"

												Pinged off into space, got an achievement for reaching 250 miles per hour for the first time.     I enjoyed my time playing the beta.  The map is really big.  Its a stylized version of the United States and it takes a good while to drive from one side to the other.  I tried to have cops chase me from one end of the country to the other, but the waypoint line kept dissapearing.  Then I would just get lost.  Wouldn't be a terrible idea to add in compass or some road signs.  You don't have to stick to the roads though, which really increases the area of your playground.        The dirt specced cars handle just as well offroad as they do on pavement, with the sacrifice of speed.  They let you try out the other specs in missions, and they seem pretty fun too.  Performance, Raid and Circuit all have their different specialties as you would expect, though you start with a fullstock car that is pretty slow and handles poorly.  You get your street spec shortly after which will improve incrementally.Car handling is good.  As you level up and gain better parts from missions and skill tests, the way your car handles will change drastically.  They capped the beta at level 10, and I have mostly level 10 gold parts.  The car handles completely different.  It sticks to the road a lot better and feels an awful lot like the Need for Speed series.  When you open the map, your car just sits in the middle of the road.  When I first started the game, I got my crappy fullstock car and did what anyone else would do.  I set a waypoint and put the hammer down.  What I didn't realize at the time was, that other people were also in the process of doing the same thing.  They had moved ahead and were now sitting dead in the road checking their map.  All the npc cars kind of clumped up around them as they slowed down to go around.   Fullstock cars don't really brake or turn well.  They don't happen to stick to the road as you would like them to.  What they do well, is turn into a ballistic missile when you try to evade these little clumps.  I'm sorry to the 5 or so people I smashed into.  That being said, there isn't much of a penalty for causing gigantic accidents.  There also isn't much in the way of reactions.  Cars get dented up, and you get a short little slowed down cutscene of your car smashing into the other car (or tree, etc).  You loose a little health permanently (until you repair) and the rest regenerates.  Sometimes the police get on you because of this.  With a lower level car, it was challenging to get away from the police, but with my 213 street car, it can be more difficult to keep from out running them.  I expect the difficulty will be ramped up by release with more police variation.  They will do a few neat things like try to box you in and stop you.  They'll try to ram and pit you, but for the most part they're kinda dumb.  The cars sound great and the graphics are really well done.  Small glich; the radio plays really low for me.  Sounds like I'm outside the car listening to the music, but the mustang sounds like a guess a mustang would.  There is a good sense of scale and size to the city when you're in it.  The buildings are tall and the streets are pretty wide.  Las Vegas has pretty lights and is in the middle of a desert.  Looks incredible as your driving up to it at night.  Miami is nice, and Washington D.C. is a short hop from New York.  It looks like they could potentially add in other maps as well.  I want them to have better filters for the map, so you can see other people better, and isolate which missions and skills will give you upgrades.  I saw people, but not as many as I expected.  There were definately a lot of people playing, but it seemed to split people up into server shards.  I really hope they allow more people onto the same session at release.  This game really has a lot of potential.  As it is, its a really fun experience.  I enjoyed my time with the game.  Played with a GTX 660; i5 4670k 3.4Ghz Quad Core, 16 GB Ram and a  500GB solid state drive.  Ran very smooth on ultra 1080p fullscreen with an occasional hard stutter that would recover after a few seconds.  They only happened about once an hour or so.  I expect graphics card drivers to fix this, because the game seemed to be optimized for my rig specifically.  I read others have had some problems, as it does require a fairly sturdy computer.			"

												I started out in Detroit did a few races to build my rep then once i was satisfied I raced to new york tuned up my car to dirt spec and went head to head with other racers it was amazing along with that I got to vist the grand canon, the big bend, white house, and countless other tourist sites then to top off I found a ruin of an old car which slowy but surely i built a car out of i'm not gonna spoil it but it was sick. if you like racing and exploreing this is for sure a game for you. The crew gets everything just right. The exploration, racing, pvp, it's amazingpro's Racing is everything you'd expect Explortion is unmatched with any other racing game or sim out theirCar's the vehicles in this game are spot on to real life models and the best part you can strip them apart and customize to your liking.Cons grahpics are a bit ehh just missing alot of polish.pvp needs work wasn't all that great really laggy at times and sometimes you complete lost control of your car during the races  "

												Worst game ever and I played a lot of bad games recently but this one is the crown jewel.First of all and the baddest thing for an online game, it keeps disconnecting from UPlay all the time. Second, it 'forgets' all the progress made because of connection errors.For the upgrades, you can't select what kind of parts you want to race for in the map menu, you can only select race type ... Maybe it's just me but i don't think it's fun to search between hundreds of races to find the race that upgrades your ECU for example to the next level.Not even close to a finished product. It's like all other pinball racing games. Don't bother buying it, it's not worth even a dime.Something good about this game ... the free roam and thats all.			"

												This game is an arcade style racing MMO. A lot of people complain because the gfx arent that great, but to be quite honest they are just fine, fine enough to be able to see the reflections of buildings on your cars paint job. i dont know what it is that people want. Nonetheless, the game is decent and i do look forward to playing it when it comes out, seemed to have a great variety of cars as well as mod parts, and cars are easy for them to add later so thats not even an issue, There are tons of drive space including offroading, with tons of objectives, goals, and acheivements.  My only complaints so far are, that there seems to be too many objectives that arent neccesarry, because you can get car parts so fast it doesnt seem like you even need to go out of your way to try that many objectives before your car is ""maxed out"" for that area. Also it seems like after about 2 months of playing you will have completed most of the content so unless they quickly add content every few months, there is a chance that the game could become quite boring.          For some reason the game doesnt cater to people who like to drive in manual either, after completing the mini objectives a screen comes up letting you know what you ranked and gives you your reward, but if you are driving in manual trans. the game wont let you down or upshift while this screen is up, which is extremely annoying considering manual is how a car is REALLY supposed to be driven.

												This game is like Need for Speed Underground 2 and Testdrive Unlimited 2 that had a baby and made this game. IF you like those games get this game!!! Steering First people had problems with the steering in this game being to arcadey. Its not at all you have 3 types of steering options in this game and plus many more options on how you turn ect like TDU2. Cars Not many cars in the game just around 40. But I can see alot more cars in upcoming DLC'S Map The map is huge!!!! The traffic in this game is insane there a bit too much to too little and some do crazy stuff too. Its funny to see what the AI will do next though. There also could be a DLC for a new map in the near future. Customization and Tuning You can basicly tune and customize any car to your hearts desire. There not much of customize options but it's way better then the new Need for Speed games. Other The game has soo many nice options in the menu but too bad the fps is limited to 60. Thats the only bad part of the game. If thats even bad.Theres so much to do in this game its insane!!! You can chase people, get chased by cops and even do story. Story is alright for the racing game. It takes around 30 hours to beat the game and thats if you want to rush threw it. There some bugs and glitches that need to be fixed but it's not game breaking. Servers are having some trouble but its launch day. For being an mmo you have 8 people in session thats 2, 4 man crews. But theres alot of people playing. Thats my review. My suggestion:If you do buy this game add me I will play with you. Also the game takes 40 hours to complete. That being said 10 hours of game play = $10 of money that you spent on this game. Therefore 40 hours = $40 and the game should be worth that. I still have more hours on this game then anyother new Call of Duty game. That says alot			"

I can't even join my friend and form a crew, which is what the game is made for. Instead i get the worst single player experience of my life.

												Deleted this game after not gettin my♥♥♥♥♥♥saved after a 1:30 hours race*** EDIT*** THIS REVIEW IS NEUTRAL! *Wish there was a Maybe button*I was playing a bit more with the game, Thats why i deleted some stand points such as the ai behavior. It seems that it was one race that really bugged me out and that it isn't the entire game Sorry for that!Also i want to make clear that those fps issues MIGHT come from my pc. I dont know how it is for everyone. ok, how to start this. The Crew, The Map is big, The tuning is just amazing. The graphics are ok. It has a 60 FPS cap added in the options menu. Sounds good right? Right! BUTThe physics are HORRIBLE! IT seems that they took watchdogs, And ruined the car physics even more! How is that even possible!? Also one thing i dont understand. Why add a crash cam if you dont have the nicest crash model? this game has nothing to really show of in crashes, Not saying the crash model is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, But its nothing you really would want to see in slow motion *I sure enjoy the sometimes flipping out cars due to internet lag from some people* Another Graphical thing.1. What did they do to the render distance? Its horrific. And dont come me with OH ITS OPEN WORLD DUH!. Look at GTA V on console, Skyrim with mods. ARMA 3!2. Racing game.. Where the mirrors on the side and inside DONT WORK in 1st person?! WHAAA? How could you ♥♥♥♥ that up?! I mean in 3rd person they work!?If that wasn't enough this game has a really  hard difficulty. No not that i am against it, GOD i love games that give me a challange, But here with those physics it just gets unfair. There are points in the game where the AI seems to be about 50% faster than you.I was really really excited for this game, And at the start i wasn't dissapointed, BUT HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥Who had the idea of making a car game that handles so♥♥♥♥♥♥that i would say APB reloaded and watchdogs would be a better racer!But now to the point. I played this game for a bit more and need to say. It is not♥♥♥♥♥♥*like i never stated it anyway just to make sure* BUT this game has some issues i cant over look. Mmo? Not really for me, never have seen more than 2 other player at once (MIGHT BE MY PORT SETTINGS) And i have waited 33 minutes to get into a pvp race (might be because you need about 3 hours to get to the point where you can do it)I was in one crew raid with one other person, No lag issues!Only thing i would say myself is that it is sad that you cant make clans/guilds like in other mmo games. Would have been a nice feature.Also next time when they do a Maintenance which i think is nice. I would REALLY love them to god damn notify us. I am not constantly on the ubisoft forum. Im never on there and i hoped i would never need to!Pros: - Awesome tuning- Big Map- The Car detail is high!Cons: - No clans :(- Physics nuff said- Graphics are worse than expected (talking more about render distance and failed animations such as the Helicopter xD)- Capped 60fps*1- Random lag? Sometimes puts me down to 30fps (may be system problems)Anyone their own- The game is hardMy spec:AMD Fx 8120 Eight core 3,10GHZ Unlocked16GB Ram64 Bit Windows 7AMD Radeon HD 7970 GHZ edition1* I still need to say that a cap at 60fps is bad. YES everyone with a monitor at 60hz WONT really notice a difference. BUT We are Pc player, we can reach the limit of 120+ So why not allow it?http://steamcommunity.com/id/Himichan/screenshot/53245498760014528 "

Lots of different and varied missions/quests all over. Since it is a mmo and a racing game surprisingly it has a decent story.

												This game is one of the best car games i have ever played! it has a huge map whit interesting stuff behind every corner. and yes it has glitches... sometimes you fly away and crash if you drive by the side of the train, sometimes you can get stuck on the wall on the side of the road and AI get stuck on some bridges, but a lot of gliches are really fun f.ex. the train glich. i have played this game two years now and i still come back many times and play it. the DLC in this game is great: the wild run was fantastic! i spendt many hours in the summit, trying to get gold or platinum. we will see about calling all units. the PvP is also really fun. you get many great gamemodes with good tracks. the custimasation in this good when it comes to appearence and ok when it comes to preformance, but it fits the urealistic style car driving. This is the perfect open world game for the person who is not that much into cars, but also for people who play a lot of car games. In my opinion the best open world and arcade car game.			"
