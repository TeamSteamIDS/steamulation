												Absolutely fantastic party game. If you enjoyed playing micromachines 'way back then' you will instantly feel right at home with Toybox Turbos. The main singleplayer mode is pretty fun and gets you accustomed with the gameplay pretty quickly but it does feel like they could have done a bit more with it. The main fun of this game comes from the elimination multiplayer which can be played against the AI, up to 4 friends on the same screen or online. What's better is that you can party up with two or three friends on one screen and play online with other opponents. Matchmaking works pretty well. Haven't really had any connection issues connecting to other players and the game is mostly lag free. The few times the lag was noticeable, it was relatively miniscule and never really affected the races.Overall a surprisingly well put together game that captures the feel and the nostalgia of the old Micromachine games.

												Ask yourself a very simple question: Do you love the old Micro Machines games?If the answer is yes, then chances are you'll love this too.It's pretty much everything you loved about the old games: fast, close and fun races; innovative tracks based on breakfast tables, playrooms, school rooms and pool tables.You can even set the view to the classic 'top down', which makes it a lot easier to spot short cuts but isn't really how the game is meant to be played.The single player campaign is rather short. I finished it in less than four hours, which is something to be aware of.I also found online to be a little bit buggy and laggy, though this could have been my connection rather than a server side issue. I'd have to play more to find out.I haven't played local multi-player yet but it should be a hoot!If you're not sure, try the demo.  For me it turned this game from a 'wait until it's on sale' to a 'I need this right now!'It may be a short and quite simple game, but it's very, very sweet.I can't wait to get this game on with three other peeps, it'll be an absolute blast!

												There is a reason why I'm writing this review right now. This game is on -75% discount sale. If you don't get it, you're missing out on the greatest fun evaaaaaaaaaaah!OK, I know you might be thinking 'this guy's been playing for only half an hour and he's rushing me to spend 3,5 €!""You might be right. But I've spent hundreds of hours playing Micro Maniacs on PSX, spin-off to popular Micro Machines series. If you've played that one or any of the Micro Machines titles - this is it - MM license free Micro Machines game. Same excitement, same fun...Some games are games. But some games are feel good games.			"

 88 MPH Charge your flux capacitors because we're going back in time. It's 1994, Blur's Park Life is echoing in through an open window, a portable TV chatters away to itself in the corner advertising a new show called FREINDS. A movie stub for Pulp Fiction sits on a desk and a fresh faced future games reviewer is hunched over a keyboard playing a game called Micro Machines on his shiny new Pentium PC. Everybody Be Cool!Micro Machines was cool.There's no denying the attraction of racing a toy car around a kitchen table, the track made from kitchen utensils, spilt sugar and the like, so much fun! You could tear around a corner, skid on some milk and fly off the edge of the table! There was nothing else like it. It was a ground-breaking game which helped establish the top down racing genre. A genre which hasn't seen too much love in more recent times. That is until now! Back to the FutureBack in the present, it's easy to look at Micro Machines with rose tinted glasses. It was a different time back then, games were simpler, mechanics less sophisticated and consumers less demanding. How would a game like Micro Machines stand up in todays market? Similar titles have been few and far between over the last decade, maybe that's for a reason, or maybe we've all forgotten how much fun this type of game is and it's time to rediscover the genre... Spiritual SuccessorIt seems like you can't read a review these days without coming across the phrase ""Spiritual Successor"".Civ Beyond Earth was the ""Spiritual Successor"" to Alpha Centauri, Next Car Game is the ""Spiritual Successor"" to the Flat Out series, Evil Within is the ""Spiritual Successor"" to Resident Evil 4, the list goes on and on. Not being one to buck the trend, I'm going to jump on the reviewers phrase of the moment and call Toybox Turbos the ""Spiritual Successor"" to Micro Machines. It's with this in mind that I approach Toybox Turbos with some trepidation.I loved Micro Machines, so could this be the reinvention I'm hoping for or a hollow copy that will diminish my fond memories of the franchise. Let's fire it up and find out! Everything including the Kitchen Sink! The first track you'll come across will have your toy car of choice racing around a breakfast table, tearing around dirty plates, avoiding the odd stray baked bean and negotiating the various utensils as you try make it across the water-filled kitchen sink.You'll find various little gift boxes floating around the course which, if you manage to pick up, will temporarily modify your vehicle by giving you a speed boost or bolting some sort of weapon to your roof enabling you to try and take out the cars in front (or drop mines to take out the cars behind!) You'll also find gold coins littering the track which you'll want to try to collect. Toys R UsAfter each race, the coins you've managed to collect will be added to your total kitty which you can then use purchase new vehicles. There are 35 for you to choose from, each fitting into one of seven different categories from construction vehicles to race cars. As you browse through the selection you will be treated to a view of each toy packaged in its own toy box which will open once you purchase it. It's nice touches like this that really help Toybox Turbos shine. There are slight differences in the handling of each vehicle too, a tractor isn't going corner the same as a race car, even if it is a toy.Track and FieldToybox Turbos fields 18 tracks, all of them bright, colourful and well designed. You'll be racing around school desks, kitchen tables, science labs etc. each with their own short cuts to learn and each with their own special touches to make you smile. You'll jump over ramps made from cake, be fired into the air by toasters and dodge run-away trains. You can tell that a lot of time and effort has gone into creating these tracks and it really shows. Sure I've got my favourites but all of them are fun to race around, just don't spend too much time admiring the scenery or you'll miss your turn or find yourself trapped behind a stubborn baked bean. This ruler isn't big enough for the both of usIt's not just about classic races either, there are end of level bosses, time trials, overtake challenges and escape runs to name but a few. If this isn't enough to keep the game fresh for you, then you can take your driving skills online and invite 3 friends to join the fun. There's nothing more satisfying than ramming a competitors taxi cab off the edge of a school ruler bridge before accelerating away over a text book and there's not many games you can say that about! Eye Spy something beginning with OculusAnother plus is the fact that Codemasters have announced that Oculus rift support is planned for this title.I'm not sure how this is going to work with this genre but it doesn't stop me being excited about it! Toybox (Micro) Troubles With regards to criticisms, I'm really going to have to nitpick here.You'll unlock all of the content pretty quickly, but after you finish the single player challenges you'll want to take this online anyway so I don't really see that as an issue.There's a first to the edge of the screen race mode which can be awkward when your winning because you can't see what's coming next. That's really about it, neither of these things are real issues and I only mention them for the sake of balance. Toybox Micro Turbo Machines Back at the begging of this review I was nervous that Toybox Turbos might take something away from my fond memories of Micro Machines and I'm happy to say that this wasn't the case at all.This is a title that knows what it wants to be and doesn't fail to deliver. It's an honest, charming and nostalgic experience which captures the feel of the original micro machines titles perfectly. Whether you were around for the original micro machines or not, I still think you'll find a lot to enjoy here. If you're looking for a fast, frantic and above all fun filled little arcade racer then you've found it! Find the full review and others LINKED HERE[www.review-well.com] "

												TL;DR Surprisingly solid, enjoyable game. Graphics are spot on, handling is just right, difficulty has challenge without being too hard. Features 4-player local/online multiplayer with plenty of options and tracks. Also top-down retro view for fans of the old Micro Machines games. Would recommend to people who like fun!I've spent the past year looking for modern-day Micro Machines-alikes but nothing comes close to the originals, I found myself replaying those instead. When I saw that CodeMasters were making a new game (albeit with the license), I was incredibly excited but also very weary. Turns out though, that it's a fantastic little game.The difficulty is not overboard like the old ones tended to be but still challenging enough, I often found myself tantilisingly close to a higher place on the online leaderboards too, which added some extra life and replayability to the game.I realised all too late that you were able to change the camera view to a retro-topdown one but I was surprised actually by how much the new camera view suited the game, I'm usually strictly retro-isometric but I'd happily play this game as-is!Altogether, this is a well put together title which has clearly had some love lavished upon it, especially considering the low pricepoint. You aren't paying the triple-A money of the original games but you certainly get the quality. The graphics are just right, the handling is great and there are several noticably nice touches in the track design.I've yet to try out the multiplayer but that is usually where Micro Machines games shone so I have no real worries there.

												This game is awesome! The handling of the vehicles is perfect for this type of game. Multiplayer is the best part if you have local or online or mixed. Just needs some outdoor courses like maybe a back garden track or even an icy outdoor track. Well worth the money. If you get this on sale I guarantee you won't be disappointed			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Toybox TurbosDeveloper:  CodemastersPublisher:  CodemastersGenre:  Top-down RacerGeneral ImpressionToybox Turbos is a very nicely detailed 3D top-down racer with plenty of diversity to overlook its few glitches that pop from time to time. The opponent AI was surprisingly prompt and really challenges you on rare occasions. Not many enough though, as once you unlock more power-ups and upgrades, Toybox Turbos can become too easy to beat. And single-player mode is the one you’ll be playing the most since sadly, the MP segment and playerbase is deficient and largely abandoned by now. However this does not remove any replayability value from this game, which can be tremendously fun once bought on offer and played in local co-op.Strong Points+ Vehicle and track diversity.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Too short and easy to complete.- Multiplayer community is lacking in numbers.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Did you play the old Micro Machines games?  They were made by Codemasters.  Toybox Turbos was also made by Codemasters, and I can only assume the name of the game was not Micro Machines because they no longer have licensing rights to the name.  If you enjoyed the Micro Machines games, you will enjoy Toybox Turbos, as it is basically an HD version of the old games.			"

												I'm writing this as a recomendation, not as a reviewThis is pretty much a great racing game on a budget, no doub't that you'll have fun if you like the power-up based car combat racing, my doubt's when I played through the demo was that it was too easy and seemed like it was too short but after the first cup and move on to the 2nd one, the game seems to take it up a notch, the racers are more aggressive and even a more advanced game mode thrown in where you try to out-race a deathly wave coming up behind you for as long as possible, so far I've only gotten silver, even after a couple of tries which in contrast, in the 1st cup I was breezing my way through.If this is the pace of difficulty that the game keeps up, then you can be sure that you will really have to work for it, for that final  race.For a measly $15, it's a game well worth it's price.

												I'd like to say yes but only if you pick it up on sale or it turns up in another Bundle.But let me explain, I thought this looked interesting. I mean it's essentially Micro Machines minus the branding which should be good right? Well...The single player is a little short, As in I managed to 100% everything in around 4 hours or less. There's just not a lot of content in this, Whilst it does have online! I just didn't enjoy it that muchI kinda wish Steam had like a okay button but I can't reccomend this at full price, As I've mentioned before if it goes on sale or pops up in another Bundle, Be that Humble or otherwise then by all means pick it up because I did have fun.

												Just what I'd been waiting for. A top down racer that shamelessly and beautifully borrows from all it's predecessors to create the perfect Friday night lolfest. The DNA of Mashed, Circuit-Breakers and Micro-Machines are all present with their best features employed to great effect. Connectivity is solid and we've experienced no de-sync as of yet. Game settings give you lots of scope for play experience, including the amazing ""Retro Top Down"" mode which re-creates the effect seen in only the earliest versions of Micro-Machines (i.e. the camera doesn't chase-follow the cars so when you are racing down the screen left and right are reversed). Circuit design is also first-rate. Excellent title, a throwback to front-room console gaming from a by-gone age. I really can't recommend this enough.			"

												Toybox Turbos is a very fun, but short racing game.  As others have said, it is the spiritual successor to the old Micro Machines games.   I loved the original NES Mirco Machines so I was excited to try this one.  The game has good graphics, fairly interesting vehicles, and bright and clever course design.  The campaign starts out quite easy but gets challenging, especially for the last two cups.  Unlike the original Micro Machines, there are some power ups scattered around the track.   Luckily, they are not so overpowered as to take over the racing / skill element, ala Mario Kart.   The campaign has a variety of different challenges, so it's not just racing.  There are time trials, picking up clocks, and an interesting mode where you try to pass as many slow cars as possible in 3 laps.  Each level also features a boss level where you must win a series of short, head to head sprints vs. the boss.  The game features bright, cheery graphics and the music and sound effects are appropriate for this style of game.  The game also runs very well on my rather older pc, which is a plus.There is also multiplayer.  Depending on the time of day, it can be hit or miss finding a match.  The game also features local multiplayer which might be very fun on big picture etc, but to have more than one player requires Xbox 360 controllers.  Multiplayer races are short sprints run on a single screen, with the slowest cars falling off the screen.  It plays a bit like a party game, not a serious racer in MP.  This game's campaign is pretty short.  I finished it in 4.2 hours, getting 100% achivements, except for local multiplayer.  Achievement hunters beware, you need an Xbox 360 controller to get the local multiplayer achievement, which kind of sucks.  Overall, I liked the game a lot, but I do have some criticisms.  My biggest complaint would be the lack of customization.  Races are always 3 laps, which is quite short.  Courses themselves are really short as well.  You must always choose a ""class"" of racecars, which is preset.  There is no option to use all of the cars or custom classes which would add variety.   The game is missing a lot of the classic car types from the original.  Powerboats, Road Warriors, helicopters, etc. are all absent.   Overall, most of these issues could be easily fixed with some DLC or the inclusion of Steam Workshop.  It's a solid game with a lot of potential and offers a lot of racing fun.  It's the type of game that you can play for 10 minutes after a long day at work and just relax.  It might even cheer you up!  For 4ish hours of gaming without counting multiplayer, you may want to wait for a sale, however.			"

												Toybox Turbos is essentially a rebooted version of the old Micro Machines games in all bar the name. These were fantastic top-down view racing games that used everyday locations to create the race tracks. Toybox Turbos continues that trend and adds vibrant levels with plenty of new obstacles to make things more interesting (or irritating, depending on your preference).The game modes are split into Classic (a simple race to the finish line), Escape (outrun a wall of death for as long as you can), Time Trial (complete a number of laps with no competitors as fast as you can), Overtake (as the name suggests, overtake as many AI cars as you can in the time limit) and Elimination which is typically a boss battle. On these the goal is to either destroy your opponent or get far enough ahead that they fall off the screen. Both players start at 5/10 points and you gain a point for getting ahead/lose a point for falling behind. First to 10 wins. These can be a bit irritating if you use the classic top-down view as you often can't see far enough ahead to dodge obstacles in time. Still, it's a minor flaw.I've not tried the multiplayer yet but the single player is great even on its own. If you're looking for a casual, fun to play racer in the vein of Mario Kart and/or were a fan of the original Micro Machines games then do yourself a favour and pick this up. Great little game. Little...get it? I'll show myself out.			"

												Kids today are oppressed.They didn't get to experience the joy of Micro Machines. This sucks because Micro Machines were the best thing. Now they got stupid crap like anime and bad video games and hippies telling people that LEGO is sexist despite the fact that nobody really cares what you buy your stupid kid. Give Johnny a Barbie Doll and give Lacie a Tonka Truck.Ok, but Micro Machines were the best. Even their licensed crap was the best. So it was '90s, back when video games needed effort to make. Someone thought ""You know, Micro Machines are cool as hell. Let's go and put them in a video game. And have them race in bedrooms, on tables, at school, in the bath, and out in the garden. And, you know what? It was awesome. Then they did it again and again. Then they made V4 and that was about as disappointing as your average Kickstarter.But, now MicroMachines are gone and kids have to grow up playing with Non-Threatening Civil Peace Corps Joe and Empowered Gender Studies Professor Barbie. Someone at Codemasters must've been like ""We want another Micro Machines because that game was cool, but there aren't any more Micro Machines. But, because someone there isn't an idiot, they said ""Ok who cares about the branding. Just call it Toybox Turbos and make the tracks and such be desks and tables and such, and make the cars toys.And it worked. Toybox Turbos is essentially Micro Machines V5. It's not as good as the original or V3, but it's still great and easily worth $15. The controls are tight and responsive, the visuals are colorful and inviting, and it's a lot of fun to play. It's a bit more challenging than the previous games, too.But, why do I say it's inferior? Basically, the track variety is all limited to being indoors. And, all wheeled vehicles. Racing helicopters in the garden or powerboats in the pond doesn't happen. Not only that, it's nice to be able to select vehicles instead of being forced into the track flavor like in the original, but it's all limited with in classes. In fact, there's an entire class dedicated to Taxi Cabs. That's kinda lame. Not only that, but the elimination boss characters do love to cheat and stay utterly uneffected by both the stats of their vehicles and track obstacles. This is a pretty lame way of padding out the game time. It serves to only give the player an agonizingly long and unenjoyable boss bout that leaves you longing for just standard racing. In all, the game could've used more classic racing instead of the tacked-on game types.Sure, it's not as cool as the first, but that was a long time ago. This game is still great. If you're as cool as Spider was, then you'll probably check this out.			"

												This game is generally solid. But to me it seems the developer shows not too much love for this game. First of all, the advertising for this game was nonexistence. This is basically Micro Machines (MM), mostly a solid remake of the PSO MM V3 version. The original MM video game series was Codemasters most successful installment during the glorious generation of 16-bit consoles in the 90s. Nowadays they produce professional racing games like Grid, DiRt and Formula One. It seems like someone at Codemasters feared a loss of reputation by releasing a fun racer like this but still smelled the extra cash that is to be found here. The game itself is technically absolutely first class. I discovered no bugs so far, the game flow is steady and controls are fine. But after inspecting the surface you can almost feel that this child has been abandonded half the way. It has that ""get this one done ASAP!"" feeling all around. There are some missing features from the original series: no Time Trials, very short tracks, only one multiplayer mode. Online multiplayer feels almost absent. You may play online: but there no one ever around. But after all these negatives one can say this game revives the old spirit very well. The game is charming you right from the start with its colorful and vivid graphic and the easy listening music. The racing tracks feature some funny themes and once the race starts everything gets instantly hysterical. After all this is a easy-to-pickup-game to race several rounds and put it aside after. Do not expect hours of excitement in single player. It is quite uncompetetive. If you can gather some friends locally this rather will provide its real potential. If you are unsure if you want to buy this, play the provided demo. The business department of Codemasters will see this product as cashcow, for the case they require quick cash. So I bet you will see this game in 2-3 months in sale for a nice discount. Just stay patient ;)			"

												If you remember playing Micro Machines, you definitely should try this game. Unfortunately, its multi-player mode leaves much to be desired, and in a game like this multi-player is the most important part. I still do recommend it, though, mainly because there aren't many games like this and it's still quite fun - especially if you bring some friends to play local co-op.+ Looks nice+ Great gameplay, very fast and dynamic+ Nice sound effects+ A lot of cars+ Maps are fairly well-designed- Single-player campaign is too short- Multi-player has only one mode available- Too hard to find a match in the online multiplayer lobby, it looks deserted			"

It also randomly exited itself sometimes. It might just be me though. No notification crash screen or anything.I played this in retro top down camera mode with a controller. Might have been easier with the default, but I kinda chose retro top down on accident and never changed it back. I liked the music for the levels. Especially the boss fights. The boss fights were the most fun part of the game for me. When the boss fight goes into ""Playoff Mode"" mines are placed on the track making things interesting. Being able to customize the colors of the vehicles you unlock was a nice feature too. Coins muct be earned in each level in order to unlock other vehicles with better stats. I have to say the challenges on each level do get a bit repetitive and it can be frustrating to get the 3 star goal. The tracks designs all have a household environment theme which range from a kitchen to a pool table. They are creative and some have shortcuts here and there which usually need to be cleared by pushing interactive objects, like dominoes, out of the way. There are 7 cups or I guess you could call them track sets. Each cup has 5 challenges and 1 boss fight. Each also has a specific set of vehicles to choose from that revolve around a theme like public transit. The challenges give you a task. Only some are to win a race while others require you to pass other vehicles or escape a blue wave that's chasing you. Each challenge has a possible 3 stars to earn depending on how well you do.  There is also mutiplayer both local and online. You'd think the online would be dead since this isin't a very popular game, but both instances I played online I found games easily. This was just the other day. The online games work much like boss fights on sigleplayer, but each player has their own win tally. Essentially you want to eliminate the other players by either getting so far ahead of them they are off screen or destroying them with items. Each round the last player standing earns tallys to their bar and the losers lose tallys. When playoff mode (tie breaker) is activated you may only gain tallys to decide a winner. This has Oculus support too if that's your thing.This is a fun little top down racing game with toys and creative level design based around household items. If you like online and local multiplayer you will get more entertainment out of this too. It's not too difficult of a game either. Also, if you liked Micro Machines you should definitely try this!

												Toybox Turbos is a fun little arcade racer and spiritual successor to the classic Micro Machines. There's a nice selection of vehicles ranging from cement mixers to moon buggies and around 7 exquisitely designed environments for you to traverse in about 5 or 6 different game modes. That really is the biggest draw for this game, racing around these wonderfully crafted cartoon environments feels fantastic and it's hard not to be distracted at times trying to take in all the details crammed into each course. The vehicles all handle differently and there's definitely a degree of strategy in selecting the right vehicle for each race but experienced players shouldn't have too much difficulty achieving gold medals in every event. Overall I played for about 5 hours and managed to 100% the game so if single player length is an important factor to you be aware of the relatively short playtime. Big WARNING though, multiplayer is a shell of the single player with just a single game mode available, Elimination, with up to 4 players. This didn't bother me as I mainly bought the game for the single player experience but for those hoping this will provide a compelling online experience, look elsewhere. I loved my time with Toybox Turbos and for the sale price I paid for it I would absolutely consider it money well spent. I'll probably dive back in every now and then to improve my times but for most part I've had my fill.			"

												This little gem from the team at Codemasters is a great throwback to the Micro Machines series from the past.This game is very welcoming to new players as there is no steep learning curve like there is with most other games. In otherwords, it is a great pickup and play. The game does become a bit more challenging towards the end I should add.Racing across table tops, desks and kitchen sinks couldn't be more fun and whacking the enemy vehicle with a mallet couldn't be more satisfying.I highly recommend picking up this game as it is a blast to play. I really enjoyed it myself.			"

												A solid Codemasters production - not necessarily for the kids - with a couple of well-polished, colourful tracks, nice vehicles & fun weaponry. Adding to this, that there are different modes to keep your entertained and similarities with big titles like GRID 2 & Dirt Showdown: Elimination & Overtake, makes this games worth a recommendation. But there's 1 problem: no one in the Multiplayer area and the game is just pretty lifeless; no motivation to push harder. Now I just hope this game will once be available for free for a limited amount of time, so that more gamers will pick it up, as was the case with GRID, Dirt 3 and Dirt Showdown. Who knows!Because of previous I can recommend it, but not for the full price. It's just too short for that, lacking replay value as well. I got this game via a bundle, so I can recommend it for a lot less: 8/10 - price tag should be €7,- max.			"

												Toybox Turbos is a mobile game masquerading as a nostalgic iteration of the MicroMachines franchise of yestayear. There is nothing inherently bad about the game, but nothing particularly spectacular either. The shallowness of content compared to its predecessors will perhaps turn a lot of nostalgic fans wanting a new and improved MicroMachines game away.As a mobile game, the content ticks all the familiar boxes; races are short, are rated with three stars, collecting coins unlocks vehicles, etc. Its biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is that it is nothing spectacular and oftentimes feels as if the developers were playing it just a little too safe - In other words, everything Toybox Turbos does as a racing game of its kind has already been seen before with the previous MicroMachines iterations (and in some cases, was done somewhat better). I would reccomend this game, however, in the hopes that codemasters develops a proper sequel more in the spirit of MicroMachines V3. What is old is new again. The negative review simply reflects a personal (subjective) disappointment.			"

												Gameplay is fun, decent enviroments and detail. Playing with a controller you can sit back and enjoy the game.What I bought it for was the DK2 support, while it does START with Direct to Rift it doesn't seem to work as of 6/12/2015. The game crashes shortly after startup. However, I found  a post from 2014 that stated shoving the Rift into Extended mode worked. Sure enough it did. Once in extended mode it worked great, no judder or anything.My only hope is Direct to Rift mode works with the latest SDK and when in VR mode make ALL text larger.10/10 would buy and play again.

												Toybox Turbos is a game where you play with toy cars on various location such as kitchen sinks, school tables, toy train sets and more. The game provides 35 cars and 18 tracks and there are various game modes but they are for single player only. For some reason multiplayer has Elimination mode for both local and online multiplayer. The game has 7 tiers of cars, the first tiers are a bunch of taxi, london cab and buses while the second tier are a set of off road vehicle which provide SUV, moon buggy and even a monster truck. The cars gets faster every tier, the final tier of cars are race cars which provides a classic F1 car, dragster, sportscar (which looks exactly like a low poly GRID 1 and GRID Autosport drift Mazda RX7) and a hot hatchback. The cars feels very floaty and all of them drive similarly, they are a bunch of Micro Machine scale toy.In the single player mode, there a total of 7 cup and each cup has 5 race. Each cup are restricted to specific tiers of vehicle and specific set of races. There are 6 type of game modes here, Classic Racing, Overtake (like the ones in GRID 2), Escape, Elimination, Time Trial and Countdown. Classic Racing also includes weapons, weapons can be used to overcome your opponent. There are a few weapons in the game such as hammers, EMP, rifle, turbo boost, mine and magnets. Magnets could pull you closer to your opponent cars, hammers lets you wreck your opponent cars and EMP could slow down the cars around you. Overtake mode requires the player to overtake a bunch of cars around the track which acts like traffic. The player wins by overtaking an amount of cars set by the game. Escape mode has a wave of water or force field like thing chasing behind you, the player requires to drive the furthest distance possible before your car being covered the water or force field.Elimination mode is also the boss race in the single player mode, weapons are provided in this game mode as well. This mode plays a bit like NFS Underground 2 outrun mode, the player requires to drive as fast as possible until your opponent car is not seen on the screen and the player loses when the car is not seen in the screen, got destroyed by weapons or flew off the track. A score is given when the player wins and 1 score taken away when you lose, the player win this race by filling up the score bar. If the race takes too long to end with constant plus and minus 1 score from you and the opponent, the game will starts putting mines around the track and losing will no longer deduct a score but every win still adds 1 score. Time Trial mode ask the player to clock the fastest time on the track but the tracks has mines to disrupt your racing line. Countdown mode is similar to Time Trial mode, the tracks has mines placed around it as well. The difference is the player requires to pick up ""clocks"" to add time to their timer, the player lose when the timer ran out of time and wins by reaching the finish line with most time left. The single player AI starts off to be very easy and they dont seem to use the weapons they pick up at all but it gets better and faster as you progress through the cups. One of the problem for the single player is the lack of proper quick race mode, you cant pick a set of cars and track combination you wanted to do a race or any other mode. The special game modes are restricted to the ""Single Player"" section which act as the career but the local multiplayer can be used as a ""quick race"" mode. You could start a local lobby yourself and the game will fill the opponent with AI, you could chose the tier of cars you and tracks you wanted to race but the multiplayer is resticted to Elimination mode only. The hard AI in the game is pretty challenging and could provide a couple more hours of fun. The game provides both online and local multiplayer up to 4 players, the only game mode for multiplayer is Elimination mode. It plays the same way like in the single player mode but instead of having 1v1 you are having a 4 player elimination race. I'll highly recommend this game if it goes on sale for around $10, the game length is really short. It took me 4 hours to finish the game with all stars and all achievement (the achievement are super easy though). For the full price Codemasters is asking for now, it is still pretty good if you are a fan of top down racer, likes the toy cars feel with bright colours and casual racing.			"

												Toybox Turbos has all the heart of Micro Machines but very little of the soul.The single player mode offers very little challenge and the tracks are far too short, there are irritating filler modes such as Escape where you have to stay ahead of a wall of blue deathy stuff for a certain distance. Countdown in which you start off with little time and have to collect clocks to get more time BUT you must cross the finish line on your last lap with a certain amount of time to get Gold. And then there's Overtake which is the most stupid mode; you have to overtake a certain number of AI vehicles within the lap limit.Boss battles are the only time in the single player game that the classic 'Elimination' mode is utilised in which you either destroy your opponent or gain enough lead on them that they are off the screen.Physics are a little too floaty at times and you'll be frustrated by the amount of time it takes to right your vehicle if you're knocked over and there's no button to quickly reset your car.Track design is a little too simplistic, they're all too short and all of them taking place indoors. Beating the single player mode enables mirror mode in multiplayer but it would have been nice to vary things in single player with mirrored tracks.Vehicle types are really limited (there are no water based vehicles) and the weapons are fairly boring and useless.You do get a feeling that Codemasters made this game with tons of DLC in mind which, if is the case, I think they have perhaps shot themselves in the foot for not offering a more stripped down version of the base game as a free starter pack. But the asking price isn't actually that bad and there is fun to be had.I think multiplayer is where this game will really shine but I don't except the flame to burn that long and wouldn't be surprised to see this game heavily discounted in the coming months.Final verdict? A fun but very short lived spiritual successor to Micro Machines with too little of the actual spirit.			"

												Remember Micro Machines on NES? Well I do. It's one of my all time favorites. I've been saying for years that it needs to be remade. Well guess what? This is it! Made by the same company that made the cult hit for the NES, Toybox Turbos is everything you loved about the old classic made new. Lots of cool little cars to collect, fun tracks, and the same tight gameplay bring back that old school fun without breaking out the NES. Fans of the NES classic or fans of racers in general are gonna find a lot to love about this. 14.99 did seem a wee bit on the pricey side to me but I still paid full price and don't regret it at all. Sales are always around the corner so if you're unsure, certainly pick this up then!			"

												Do you like micro machines? Do you want a game that brings you nostalgia from playing MM as a kid? Well, you better look  somewhere far away from here.This game looks more like a money grab for people who loved MM. The tracks are really small, like 20 secs lap small, and even 18 tracks it doesn't look like much.  Also the one that tought that filling the track with jumps that send you flying into curves was a good idea should be fired.The cars are nice, but they don't really play much different from each other. A mini will be as fast as a F1 car. And a bulldozer will be as agile as a rally car. There's only 6 weapons, and only 2 or 3 are usefull. The game also has a difficulty curve that goes up 90º after 3 or 4 cups. It starts ""you can play with your eyes closed"" easy, and from one cup to the other becomes ""one single mistake and you can't win"" hard. One minute your opponents can't keep up with you, the other if you get behind for some reason, it's impossible to catch up.This is at most a 5€ game, and even with that price only buy it if you are not expecting a new micro machines "

												I think this is great, the singleplayer campaign may seem too easy at first, but believe me it gets difficult later.I had some fun playing this, really reminded me of an older game called ""Mashed"".Multiplayer was really fun, but sadly I only got to play it once since not many exactly still play this.A fun little arcade race game, recommend to buy it during a sale or in a humble bundle.Also it doesn't require some overly dedicated fan to get all of the achievements, which is personally a plus for me.7.5/10			"

												Great fun but priced too high because singleplayer is short. I never played any 3D MicroMachines games so I can't compare that gameplay for you. But I was a massive fan of the first 2D MicroMachines growing up and that game's DNA can be found here despite being quite different on the surface. This game just ""feels"" right and is plain FUN! There's a wide variety of cars that do feel quite different, but there's a nearly screen length massive drafting system. So you can catch most cars with most cars and keep races close. Then while they went big on the amount of cars they dropped the ball on track amount. Most of the track themes are there though and provide a wide variety of fun scenery. I do really wish they would've included outdoor and garage tracks. And then there's enough modes to keep you interested throughout the campaign (Race, Overtake, Time Trial, Survive, and some other time related one). It was simple fun that brought back some good feelings. I did manage to 100% the singleplayer aspects within 2.5hrs which doesn't thrill me. The original MicroMachines was pretty much unbeatable as the difficulty increased. This rarely posed much of a challenge. Which is where we come into the price discussion. $14.99USD is too much. I would feel pretty bummed out at the singleplayer lack of a challenge if I forked over that much. But that's what sales and bundles are for! This was a superb bundle toss in game for me and became a hidden gem because of the bargain. Simply put; I had fun. Lots of fun. But not full price fun. Shop wisely!Edit 1: Played some local multiplayer. Good fun. Only one game mode which is ""elimination"". And car choices are limited to one of the classes at a time. These consist of 4 or 5 car choices. So it ends up another shallow experience. Fun! But shallow.Edit 2: Finding some good times on online multiplayer while its populated from the recent Humble Bundle crowd. Still just one game mode, and there can be host lag. But eh, its another couple hours of fun. Receommended for sure. :)			"

A pocket-sized game for those who can accept the things they cannot changeToybox Turbos may not carry the MicroMachines name, but in every other way it is a true successor... for better or worse. While other games will try to make you feel in charge, Toybox Turbos makes it very clear that the developers are running the show.Other games try to give you an explanation why that camera is at that ungodly angle, or why THAT enemy has to have three times as much health. Not TT. The reason why the camera won't let you look ahead, is because the developers wanted to make it slightly frustrating. Ditto on the strange car physics... and let's not even speak about how the camera is always NOT right behind the car, leaving you slightly disoriented.Accept that this as the real challenge you've been given and TT will be a lot of fun. Or at least as much fun as you can have with 18 tracks. Yes, the game is very short. Four hours and you should have received every car, track and achievement that's available.What makes Toybox Turbos different from the hundreds of mobile games that try to imitate Micro Machines is that it does not ever apologize for its shortcomings. With a camera that limits how far you can see, you'd expect long straight streets with virtually no obstacles. You'd expect environments that never block your view. You'd maybe expect a mini-map. And you'd definitely expect the camera to tightly follow your car at predictable angles.TT will have none of that. Instead you're given confusing environments with sharp turns, narrow straights, hundreds of deathtraps, a lot of stuff that is only designed to get in your way or block your view and a camera that will make every tight turn an exercise in multitasking.And it works. It's a kind of challenge I haven't seen in years and it is oh so refreshing to encounter it once again. True, in the day of Micro Machines, the technology of the day required this kind of limitation, while it's just an artistic choice now, but it still feels good. And in a way, you feel like every match is a personal match against the designers. "

												The single player experience isn't much to write home about. I'd even go so far as to say it's frustratingly bad, with ""boss-fights"" that are disproportionately harder than any of the levels leading up to them. That said I'm definitely going to recommend this for party play. There's only one mode at time of writing and that plays out a lot like Speedrunners with the last man being eliminated when the camera, following the leader, leaves them out of view. Knocked out players have the option to air-strike players still in the running so there's no waiting around for the next round to start. Even with the limitations get on mumble, Skype or Vent with three friends and memories will be made.

												I haven't played micro machines for a long time but there is a lot of love for that genre of game and is always a blast multiplayer. I picked this game up for a few dollars in a recent codemasters sale and it was well worth it. Downsides, I did have issues with the game crashing when i first opened it up and at various times during gameplay (which i resolved by following some review posts or community guides). Once past that it was a lot of fun, lots of different vehicles and some interesting levels. Gameplay progressing from easy to slightly harder, nothing too tricky though. The levels were very reminicent of micro machines, i'd love to see more though... it started to get a little repetitive towards the last stages of the game.

												Do you remember MicroMachines for Sega? This is almost exactly the same, only with dedicated GPU graphics and some battle twerks here and there. I'm been playing it with a generic PS3 Controller and a Xbox360 gamepad emulator (X360ec, for if you're into that kind of explicit details), and so far, beyond the cluster♥♥♥♥ that is setting up the gamepad, the ingame control is smooth and responsive. The game itself is fun. Not like playing, i don't know, Mario Kart drunk or high as ♥♥♥♥ on weed, but funny. A little bit repetitive, thou.  You should buy it if is in sale or in some bundle (I've got mine thanks the BTA of Humble Codemaster Bundle). Personally, I wouldn't pay full price for this ($15 at the time of this review)-¿Recuerdan el MicroMachines para Sega? Esto es ""casi"" lo mismo, sólo que que necesita de GPU y tiene unas pequeñas modificaciones de batalla aquí y allá. Lo estuve jugando con un controlador génerico de PS3 y un emulador de control de XBOX 360 (X360ec, por si necesitas ESOS detalles), y por ahora, más allá del problema que fue configurar el gamepad, los controles ingame son fluidos y sensibles. El juego en sí es divertido. No como jugar, que sé yo, Mario Kart en pedo o drogado, pero divertido. Aunque un poco repetitivo. Deberías comprarlo si esta en oferta, o en algún bundle (tuve el mío gracias al BTA del Humble Codemaster Bundle). Personalmente, no pagaría precio completo por esto ($15 dolares al momento de escribir la reseña) "

												If you played the old Micro Machine games back in N64 and PS1 days, you are in for a retro nostalgic treat! Toybox Turbos seems to be the result of Micro Machines going out of business and codemasters no longer having the right to use the licensed name, but make no mistake, this is a Micro Machines game at heart. The lighthearted tracks racing across various household objects with mini cars is a delight. The weapons system is fun with mini hammers, machine guns, and other schenanigans. The multiplayer is fantastic from the couch if you have 2-4 controllers. The multiplayer camera follows the group, and whoever pulls the camera ahead wins that match, and first to 10 wins. Did I mention there is a car with an udder on top that moos when you honk? WIN! -PR0XIDIAN			"

												A long time ago there was a game called Micromachines. It use to be one of my favorite games. Toybox Turbos is bringing back the nostalgia of Micromachines. The cars are easy to control, the graphics are quirky and fun, and the multiplayer function adds even more awesomeness to the game. Anyone who has ever played Micromachines would love this game. I loved it the first second I played it. There is nothing more fun then going 50 mph in a toy car, slamming into a cereal box, spinning out on control on spilled milk then falling to your death in a sink full of water!			"

												How many racing games have you played with1. No cheating AI?2. No imba powerups/cars?3. No frustrating gamemodes?This is it.Instead of cheating AI, there's slipstreaming, just like GTA Online (driving in the trail of your opponent makes you go faster). Unlike GTA Online, once everyone is bunched up together, the race gets more fun, not less, so it's not an issue here but rather a very big plus. The powerups are all balanced and the receiver even has a chance to negate some of them (i.e. being set on fire actually speeds you up, so you can use it to gain a massive lead, however you also get very slippery controls and if you touch an obstacle, you die, so only do if you're not on fire). This is a game of skill, not luck, so no matter what powerup you get, you're not any worse off than the other guy.The cars are divided into groups depending on their speed, so you can't under any circumstance race against a superior car. At the same time, various cars in a group are all different in their handling and you're guaranteed to find your favorites. They went complete nuts with their designs so racing bulldozers, tanks or moon buggies is a normal occurence (they're all reasonably fast despite not looking the part).I've only played through the campaign alone, and I had a blast, in fact I find myself playing Elimination just for fun even now. I can only imagine how fun multiplayer would be, but alas, I've yet to catch an online game that doesn't lag so much it's unplayable, and my dear roommate thinks inviting him to play is an assault on his loyalty to Need for Speed. But I assure you this is the game you want to play with friends, there is absolutely nothing standing between you and the fun. There is no fat, no frustrating stuff, just pure fun, fun like we may not have again in a long time.			"

At its heart it's still Micro Machines but there are too many negatives:Only 5 hrs of single-player funTracks are short and repetitive (and there are not many of them)I preferred the cleaner visual style of MM seriesI miss the ""garden"", ""sandbox"" and ""bathtub"" themesOn the other hand we have to mention the pros:Great controlsLow system requirementsGreat new game-modesIf you can get it on a 66-75% discount, go ahead and buy it.

												A great remake of the classic Micro Machines in all but name, Toybox Turbos delivers wacky non-stop action. Basically a crazy racing game with a variety of customizable miniature (toybox) cars and suped-up weapons (e.g. giant hammers on the roof of your vehicle!), TT features a range of tracks such as the pool table, science lab, kitchen etc. All of the features that made the original Micro Machines games so good are here, plus some new game modes such as 'overtake' and 'escape' in single player, and (of course) online play. The multiplayer facilities in TT are quick and simple, meaning you can jump into races easily and race as few or as many tracks as you like. Plus, you can still play on the same computer with a friend, using controller(s)/WASD/arrow keys. Overall, a very fun game that is really great value on steam sale.			"

												Your childhood, now in 3D!The fact that codemasters still care about this classic series brought a tear to my eye.Seriously though, this game is pretty great. If you're a big fan of the old 2D MM games as I am, you'd probably enjoy the ride.First of all, the graphics. You've probably seen the screenshots, and to be honest, it doesn't seem to look all that impressive. It's certainly far behind in quality to codemaster's other racing games, say, GRID or DiRT. That's certainly what I thought. But make no mistake -- once you play the game, you will see that the graphics aren't bad at all. The game was designed to be lightweight and welcoming, and that's exactly what the graphics on this game does: it makes you feel good. It's the kind of game you'd want to play waking up on a saturday morning. The upbeat music also helps. One of the reason I wasn't too fond of MM V4 was because of the danky graphics and techno-electronic music tracks. This game has none of that.Then there's the gameplay. While racing through an environment of tabletop items is pretty fun in itself, the game adds a few elements to make it more interesting, such as items and different race modes. I don't have much else to say on this aspect, other than that it's very faithful to the MM games of old (it even has a retro camera!) which is never a bad thing.Of course, the game isn't without its caveats. The single player campaign is very short, it has too few tracks (18), and the difficulty curve can be pretty overwhelming. The one thing I was most dissapointed about though, was the lack of variety. The old MM games had many different types of tracks, including gardens, sandboxes, and even bathtubs (personal favorite), each with its own set of challenges. Even the traditional tabletop levels were much more creative (music boxes and whatnot). This game does away with that, and rather just offers you a few different tracks of 3 themes -- breakfast, school science lab, billiards, and construction playground. While there's nothing wrong with the tracks themselves, they can get pretty old pretty quick. This game would have benefited greatly if codemasters had included workshop support, but I guess that's asking a bit much from a niche game such as this.Another thing I find annoying about the game -- though this is purely subjective -- is the use of a mobile-game like scoring system. You got 1st place? 3 stars. 2nd place? 2 stars etc. Then you use said stars to unlock more levels. While there's nothing technically wrong with this system, I'd prefer that my PC games stay away from mobile game mechanics.In conclusion, if you're a die hard MM fan, then consider buying this game. If you're just a casual racer looking for some quick fun, you'd better wait until it goes on sale. For the latter, it's not really worth the asking price.			"

												Here's a genuinely sweet, fun little racing game. I don't particularly play racing games, but the graphics on this were adorable, and it gave me a pleasant surprise.The AI is surprisingly good in races and I didn't notice too much rubberbanding going on with the game, and the multiplayer is some great fun, since all the rounds are elimination-based and can actually get pretty intense. Single player isn't terrible at all, and there are multiple different modes to make the game not monotonous. The game also does not overstay its welcome, with 100% completion taking me about ten hours, and that's with me being awful at racing games.I'm not actually sure if it's because I'm just bad at racing games either, but the game does provide some actual challenge with its various modes. The time trials are absolutely brutal, and I finished all of them within a second of the required time to get a perfect rating, so even to people who play the genre all the time, this might be interesting as a grab for them.There are so many little tiny details that were put into this game that I love. The cars have little screws on the bottom. There are a few cars that come with working sirens, and all of them have working horns which you can spam, if nothing else. The levels themselves are absolutely adorable, all clearly designed with the idea of your cars actually being toys in mind.This is really just a cute, very fun game that I would recommend to everyone who wants a new little racing game to try out, especially if you have some friends who would want to give it a go with you.

And it is awesome, just as Micro machines was.If you are the type of person who enjoys having a few friends over for some local PvP action then this game a must have. There are only a few games that can provide a similar level of competitive action and just pure fun of screwing your friends over. Codemasters know their stuff - car handling is spot on, tracks are varied and interesting, plenty of cars, balanced power-ups and a nice bug free release as far as single player and local mp go. I would have liked to see some more next gen graphics perhaps, grander effects here and there, a button to drop a power-up but all in all it’s all good.85/100			"

												Toybox Turbos isn't the longest game in the world counted on available courses, but it is incredible fun to play. The controls aren't real because they aren't meant to be. You play toy cars and they behave that way. While the game isn't that long, it still contains tons of playing hours just in single player mode. Added bonus are both internet and lan play, which I haven't tried. I'm a solo player, but I could see how it could be fun to play against your friends too.I probably wouldn't get it for the normal price of €15, but if you find it cheap in a sale or bundle, it's definetly worth the time to play it.

												If pure, unadulterated joy sounds like something you'd be interested in, you might be interested in Toybox Turbos.For those inexplicably unfamiliar with the old Micromachines games, let me explain how this works:You drive a car. A tiny car. You race other tiny cars around tiny tracks made of household objects like dishes in the kitchen sink and books with witty titles. You collect tiny parcels that give you silly powerups such as an EMP device and, of course, the timeless mounted instakill mallet.And it's a racing game, so the objective is to get to the finish line first after 3 laps, right? Well, no. Not necessarily. The single-player campaign has various game modes: There's the (relatively) dull go-round-3-times-win-congrats mode, the rather tense OMG-flee-from-scary-blue-space-stuff mode, the satisfying make-traffic-explode-by-overtaking mode, and others.And then there's THE mode. The way it's meant to be played: The mode where the objective is to get your opponent off the screen by any devious means necessary - by strategically nudging them off the bridge of rulers, by tactically falling back before opening fire with a tiny tommy gun, or just by being boring and going fast.And on top of the solid mechanics, there are loads of lovely little details:  Plenty of maps with creative designs and hidden shortcuts.  The little joy of unlocking the collectable cars by taking them out of their packages.  Local and online multiplayer. The 'classic' camera mode. A host of vehicles - hovercraft, bulldozers, black cabs, tanks - each with customisable colour schemes and their own horn effect. (Yes, they even added a 'honk horn' button. What does it do? Nothing, if you don't count putting a grin on your face.) A demo so you don't even need to read this review. I don't know why you'd still be reading. Just go and play a couple of rounds for free.I don't generally enjoy racing games. I'm not a nostalgic person. I don't usually grin like a 5-year-old on Christmas morning... except when I play Toybox Turbos.			"

												Captures the Micro Machines gameplay better than any game in recent memory and is a blast on local co-op with three other people.Multiplayer is limited to one mode (elimination) while single player has quite a few more, but won't take long to complete, so don't buy it expecting to stick hundreds of hours into it. But for an occasional quick pick up and play with friends you'll be lucky to find anything better (apart from maybe Mario Kart on the Wii).			"

												 Great little game. Excellent physics, the feel and handling of the car is really clean and smooth. Online multiplayer is VERY unstable for some people (including me), so feel free to check the forums. Single Player is alright, but is rather lacking in legth, and includes multiple different game modes and a moderatly sized array of weopon pickups at your disposal. I have not tried Local Multiplayer yet with anyone else but myself, and both Online and Local have customisable race options (e.g. Weopons pickups on/off, Car type, and AI on/off ((plus difficulty settings of the AI))) You can also play the AI (who can be quite challenging, with difficulty settings, easy, medium, hard) by yourself which is what you will probably spend most of your time doing.Ratings:Single Player Performance:  10/10, very stable single player performance.Online Multiplayer Performance:  3/10, performance varies for different people, but most agree it is not down to your computer or internet, and a patch for this issue is unlikely. Car Handling and Feel:  9/10, very easy to control.Single Player Campaign:  6/10, bit to short.Vehicle Variety: 5/10, a small but fun variety of vehicles to choose from.All in All: 7/10; 8/10 IF you can get the online multiplayer to work and run smoothly.

												Wow, why isnt this called Micro Machines? I mean, its the same studio (Codemasters), and the game is simply the same thing. Its really great, I have Micro Machines V4 on a dvd, and cant get it to work on newer (windows vista/7/8/10) machines. And the best part of this game is that it works on newer machines. The graphics are decent, well optimized (works on my old 8400m GS 128MB laptop + 2gb and core 2 duo).The only thing thats worse than in the original Micro Machines, is that there is fewer cars, and i think fewer tracks. But the games playability is still great. Its Simply a 9/10 from me, i bought this on Humble Bundle in a 5.5$ bundle with Grid 2, Grid 1 and Grid Autosport :)			"

												This is like any other top-down racer out there. I played through the first scenario, easily winning even when I wiped out alot or got wasted by the AI. (I am not the most skilled gamer). MM was difficult to get the hang of, and then magical when you did. It's like they designed this game from a description of the old games, without actually playing the old games.If you are a fan of the genre, this is a nicely done contribution.If you are a fan of MM and are usually disappointed by atttempts to recapture its magic, you will probably be disappointed again.If you were a fan of MM, but haven't played it in forever, but just remember it was fun, maybe this one will work for you.

The graphics are pretty good and it supports Occulus Rift; depending on your graphics card specs. Some of the levels are repetitive and gameplay can be frustrating.

												I've tried A LOT of things on my Oculus Rift DK2, but this is by far the best experience! Much better than Assetto Corsa, and overall, a better experience than EuroTruck Simulator 2 (though not by much, because that experience is great). This game is a lot of fun with or without an Oculus Rift. It was one of the few games that drew in my non-gamer girlfriend, and it's really simple to pick up and play. You can't not have fun with detailed, whimsical maps, and the racing is pretty frantic....And then you try it with the Rift and it's a whole different, even more amazing, crazy fun experience. The best way I can explain it is like living a scene from Andy's bedroom in Toy Story where the toys are having fun while Andy's away. It's incredible. The game runs flawlessly, and it should run perfectly on even old hardware, as it's good looking, but not demanding at all. Get it!			"

												[懷舊經典game]一隻重製以前紅白機同超任既經典作 micromachine.操作簡單, 容易全成就, 有micromachine既味道.有local 同 online multiplayer, 4個fd 一齊玩就最啱.畫質當然係靚咗同埋單機加咗好多模式嚟增加耐玩性.可惜, 佢無咗我本人覺得micromachine 最好玩既元素.1. 無咗組隊模式. 以前有種打法就係一個隊友去拖死兩個敵人, 等另一個隊友去沖.2. 地圖唔夠大, 唔夠長. micromachine 有d 地圖係長到你一直都係行直路, 個背景一直都係一樣, 你唔知道幾時會有個急彎. 背得地圖者會有優勢. 帶頭果個可以扮前面要轉彎, 等其他人跟你跌死. 3. 冇咗飛機, 艇同坦克玩. (呢隻game 都有艇同坦克, 但係都係當普通車咁, 唔係行水, 無得發炮)4. 冇咗bugs, 以前有時就走出地圖者反而獲得勝利, 完全唔知點解. 但係係一種趣味嚟.  （呢樣冇其實好正常)同埋呢隻game 唔知點解multiplayer 得一種模式, 無得揀其他模式. 連最普通既classic racing mode 都無, 我覺得有d 奇怪.如果而家有fd 嚟搵我打機,要我揀玩micromachine 定 Toybox Turbos, 我依然會揀micromachine. 因為多人模式趣味性高好多.但係我都會推薦呢隻game 比steam 玩家, 因為佢有懷舊既味道. 同差唔多類型既steam game 相比 ( Super Toy Cars, BlazeRush ) , Toybox Turbos 高出幾班. 上網同3個fd 玩依然有趣.

												When I saw this I was excited that Codemasters made what should of been a great Micro Machines sucessor.So what do we get? Instead we got something that came with only a fifth of the content as Micro Machines V4, the last major game in the series before Turbos, and Turbos came with more bugs than MMV4 to top it off.I mean, for content we don't even get to race on rooftops, the backyard garden, the bathroom, at the swimming pool, stores, on a freakin large ship, or even across the stovetop (we're just left to be on the table), we're just stuck with three themes! As for car classes, that has been greatly reduced here as well.Can we at least get workshop to make up for the lack of content you provided us, Codemasters?If you haven't played any of the previous MM games, then I can see where all the enjoyment comes from, but if you've played any of the other titles, well, this game is just simply alright but nothing more.I'd absolutely LOVE to recommend this game, but I just can't bring myself to.

												Toybox Turbos gets a lot of the fundamentals of the original Micro Machines games down quite well.The tracks are fun and populated with an all manner of daily items and some not so daily ones.You race with a variety of fun little cars, ranging from Double Decker Buses to Monster Trucks and Tanks.The race modes are entertaining and the Boss Battles at the end of a chapter are a nice change of pace.Unfortunately, the game has very little content. About halfway through the game you stop seeing new tracks and are just playing through the same variety of modes across the same tracks, just you go a little faster. It took me about an hour and twenty minutes to get 3-stars on all of the tracks, beat all of the bosses and grind up the rest of the coins to buy the remaining 2 cars at the end of the game.For someone who hasn't played a racing game before, it might be quite challenging. I'm sure the game is targeted towards children who don't even know what a Micro Machine is.But for me, who does know what a Micro Machine is, I felt it was missing quite a lot. There were no wacky cast of characters to choose from as your racer, the AI all did the same thing every race, including driving up against walls and flying off the track in Head to Head mode and there's only one track in the entire game where you get to drive in the pockets of the pool table and you only get to race on it once.For a remake of the classic Micro Machines games it presents to you the absolute minimum. Small cars driving on familiarly themed but equally tiny tracks.For $10, it's a fun little nostalgia trip with a few funny references tossed into the event names, a charming aesthetic and some great miniature cars you can paint up how you like. But the overall game itself is very lacking and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except children and fans of the older games.			"

												Toybox Turbos is a very easy game. Now, easy doesn't necessarily mean bad but I just can't see myself recommending this game to anyone except die hard fans of the Micro Machines V games. And even then... I was a huge fan of V3 when I was a kid. And this game does make you relive the nostalgia you had during those times but the game fails to really expand on anything or make itself stand out.The biggest disappointment by far is the tracks. Not only is there not many of them, but they're insanely short. A single track could take just 20 seconds to complete each lap for a grand total of minute long races. I can't recall if Micro Machines had longer tracks but, in this game, the tracks are just way too short. The visuals are nice but you'll get tired of seeing the same scenery over and over again especially when the design of them aren't exciting or challenging. Every track feels roughly the same and doesn't keep the races fresh. Shortcuts are rather weak and don't have any sort of creativity put behind them except for maybe one or two. Most of them just involve creating a small micro shortcut that let's you skip a hairpin turn.There's not much to really complain about the driving other than the really dumbed down physics. Colliding with other drivers doesn't cause much penalty to you or them so trying to play dirty doesn't work. That's left up to the weapons and they're honestly really boring when you stip them down to their basic principle. There's a hammer which destroys anything in front of you in one hit, a machine gun with autoaim that can kill you and mess up your handling, an emp ball that is supposed to short out the controls but is so minimal it's useless, a magnet that let's you instantly snap to any other driver, and rocket boosters. That's really it.The game's music is okay I guess. It's nothing too exciting there's really only about 3-5 music tracks to go around so get used to that. The music varies depending on the mode you're playing and... well there's only 5. You have your standard races (which only go to a max of 4 for some reason), time trials, race against the clock, overtaking and escape. Escape is by far the best mode but eventually you get to a point where the blue aura of death goes much faster than you and kills you automatically making fighting for the leaderboard rather impossible.Apart from that the game is just too easy. It has a spike in difficulty once you reach the 4th or 5th cup but for the first few cups you'll be whizzing right through every challenge with ease. Despite the spike in difficulty I still managed to beat the game and unlock every car within 3 hours.The multiplayer is decent enough. I've yet to play classic mode but they made the smart choice of taking the Elimination mode from the boss-battles and made it between 4 players which is nice. Players fight for points as one person either A. Has to leave the pack behind in the dust or B. Be the last one still alive. But it's hard to recommend because no one seems to own this game and the only one online battle I was able to find was on launch day.Overall Toybox Turbos does a fair job of being reminiscent of the old Micro Machines games but fails to capture the same charm and fun those games had. It just doesn't do anything new or exciting to make itself stand apart. Again, if you're a true Micro Machines V fan then I suggest checking out the demo, but even then I'd be wary of making a purchase.Toybox Turbos gets a 6/10.			"

This game suffers terribly from a bad camera that tries far too hard to keep aa many vehicles on the screen at the same time and makes it impossible to see what's coming up, often resulting in the player ending up caught in a corner for no good reason.

I hope the devs are reading. 1) the default camera position when putting on the rift doesn't feel correct, even after resetting the view multiple times. Also the rotating twirl animation going in the UI is not fancy, it makes me sick.  2) I had to go in Direct HMD mode (DK2,GTX680, i5 4,2ghz) and noticed a lot of jitter going on while looking around, sitting still was the best expierence.. even with VR medium quality setting.  3) using the F12 key to reset the camera makes a Steam screenshot so simply use R or none steam Fkey..

												This game would've gotten a positive review based on its actual merits anyway. Its execution is almost flawless for what it is - a fun, cheerful racer without a serious bone in its body. The music is excellent, the visuals are very good, the difficulty design (curve) is good... a bit frustrating at times but I suppose most people expect challenge from games (I don't - I just want the achievements).So let's say that's a 9/10. But then... On top of all that comes my 1994 Micro Machines nostalgia - that is a force to be reckoned with. I still remember days spent playing the shareware demo in awe. And this is surely a worthy successor. Heck, it's made by the same company!So the end result is in the ballpark of ""19/10,  bretty good - IGN""			"

												I don't actually remember getting this game, it must've been part of a bundle, and maybe £11.99 is a little steep  for it.But that said it's pretty fun. The races are quick and fairly easy, use of an xbox controller is seemless and it just a basic kid style game with a few various game modes although I do find the boss level challenges rather tedious.

												The game is fun, though I don't think it brings anything new to the genre.  The first half of the game is incredibly easy.  The second half has some tricky parts, and the final boss was fairly satisfying and not too infuriating.  4 hours is the amount of time I needed to get every achievement and unlockable, except the online race one, as nobody plays it online, so I need to find someone for that.  So yeah, it's a relatively fun, relatively easy, rather short game.  But thumbs up.			"

												A pretty nifty game and a spiritual succesor to Micro Machines.It's main drawback is the length of the single player experience and weaksauce variety Previous games had boats and helicopters you aren't going to encounter here.And i mentioned the game being short. I literally completed the game before i got all the steam cards.That's how short the single player is.Still that's fair since the game is more geared for wacky multiplayer fun than single player AI bashing so the game supports. Just get the game when it's on sale for $5 if you only want to play alone. "

												Why are these little cartoonish racing games so much bloody fun in VR? Oculus Rift DK2 gameplay video: http://www.interleave-vr.com/files/youtube-anti-html5video-viewer.php?v=d15fLoZEjQg (Stereo 3D recording)Seriously first BlazeRush and now Toybox Turbos... both similar games but each with their own charm. Comparing the two and focusing on Toybox Turbos I could say this game is a little more cartoonish and has an even more ridiculous setting than its counterpart. From a kitchen to a classroom and a play room, the environments are always creative and the cutness factor is high. Some of the situations are so ridiculous (ex.: the toaster jump) that you'll just laugh out loud at what you're seeing. This game is the second title I see based on a genre that I would've initially though VR would be useless for... and I've now been proven wrong twice in a row. Why do these little racing games have to be SO awesome in the Rift? :-DPS: Suggestion... please replace the blue plane in ""escape"" mode by toybox police cars with the flashers going... They could go at you 3-wide, and one overtaking you would spell the end. I just felt that was a missed opportunity to have toybox cop chases! lol			"

It feels like it should control better as it looks great but just misses that target by a mile. I do not recommend this game for other reasons like the ******** bosses which took 1 hour to get past the construction one which I did not even get past and just uninstalled it. I said Im done with this game. I want some difficulty changes or a difficulty selection as being thrown into that after everything else was easy. The difficulty, the bugs, and the AI really makes me want to not recommend this game but that is for you to decide. I might reinstall this game at a later date.			"

												Neat game. I bought this game in a 4-pack to play Multiplayer with friends online.Only big problem is the MULTIPLAYER ONLINE. The only game mode for Multiplayer is Elimination. And it is fun.But there is no standard race, or other multiplayer modes.....just elimination. Baffling how they would make other modes in single player and not for multiplayer.But for $2 or $3 it's still worth it if you have 3 other friends to play with and a gaming controller.			"

												Toybox Turbos is the latest micro racer from the house of Dizzy or Codemasters as they are more commonly known. It is Micro Machines in all but name, but still manages to capture the look and feel of those classics.Racing takes place on courses in various rooms of the house just as an imaginative young mind might create. Most of the courses are fun and feature lots of big jumps and tight corners and are set in some imaginative locations such as a dinosaur park, a kids party and dad's snooker table. Most of them have hazards such as train tracks to jump over, oil slicks to slip on and even a volcano spitting out lava onto the track. There are also a great selection of vehicles which include the usual sports cars and hatchbacks as well as diggers, earth movers, police cars and tanks.As you race around you can collect power ups which you can then use to blast the living daylights out of any other racers who happen to stand between you and an ill deserved first place. Remember that they can give as good as they get and will shoot back. Races are quite short at only 3 laps and over within a flash.In the single player game each championship is based around a certain type of vehicle such as emergency or construction vehicles. These include the normal finish first races, time trials and overtake challenges. Each one ends with a one on one boss race where you have to outrun or blast your opponent to win. Do this a set number of times and you win their car and unlock the next championship. The game also features a good multi player mode with all of these types of races and more.Unfortunately the game is quite short – you will finish the single player game in a couple of hours and even the multi player doesn't really give you that much more to do. It has a sort of ""seen it done it"" feel to it which becomes a little monotonous after a while. Having said that the game is fun while it lasts.It does have a fairly low price tag and Micro Machines fans will probably get more out of it, but the short play time hurts it a lot – if you really want it get it on sale...

												ARGH! Toybox Turbos is great! - but WHY did codemasters make such an awful multiplayer?Codemasters has made some amazing race titles over the years (see the DIRT & GRID series of games), and brought their great engine and art design to a new frontier in the micro-machines inspired Toybox Turbos.  The preview video looks amazing, the gameplay is cartoony fun, and I can even forgive the kid-friendly difficulty level, but there are some glaring problems here. There are little things like 4:3 overlays that look strange on 16:9 monitors and a bizzare playoff mode - but the most horrible thing is the state of the multiplayer and overall jankyness of the online modes. The only option for competition is this game mode where you race for 8-10 seconds and respawn over and over. It is so mind-numbing it makes me sad. The inclusion of a normal race mode would have made all the difference in the world. WTF Codemasters!I actually purchased the 4-pack since I was so excited to play with my friends, but at this point I want my money back. 6 / 10 for a game that I want to like so much. Do not buy in its current state.			"

												I really do not care for this game. I do not like the camera angle. Its annoying and it stupidly pans out so that both cars are showing on the screen. So the player car cannot see whats in front of him. Also the views are not very good as well. Instead of the 3d side view I would have liked  a view right behind the car. I just think they could have done better with the camera and offered more viewpoints. You have 3 or 4 views and 1 of them is useless. The top down view is useless as you cannot see the track to navigate. Also the cars do get quicker  and rather then help the game I feel like it hurts the game even more because of the terrible viewpoints the game sticks you with. A better game would be Little Racers STREET that has more cars and a much more interesting tracks and even includes weather effects. It also has a ton of camera angles including a bumper camera behind the car. Also the tracks are super small. So when your racing your car around the track races are over very quickly and this gives me the impression of an android game.  I did try the demo and enjoyed it because it was easy to win races. Later in the game it gets much tougher and its a lot more annoying. So more speed plus a crummy camera angle=a turn off for me.			"

The stages and gameplay is fun and interactive but there are some negatives to this game at the moment and I'll list those.Pros:Easy ControlsFun MapsTons of AchievementsInterchangable carsCons:Multiplayer is lacklusterPrice is too high for content(3-4 hours of singleplayer action)I recommend this game for family entertainment and I also recommend it if you enjoy arcade style racing.  However, I do not recommend it at full price and I think this game is best picked up in a bundle or on sale.Here is my video review if you need to have a complete overview.

I enjoy most games but what I probably enjoyed the most was playing the Megadrive as a youngster.With less than 30 minutes playtime of Toybox Turbos, all that nostalgia came rushing back! Wouldn't reat it worth the full price but if it's ever on sale or on a bundle, take advantage as it's a very well made game, you can have a good laugh and there's an online mode which I'm yet to try but sure it'll be good fun!

However, after what Steam is recording as only 3 hours play, I have completed the Single Player, 3 Starred every single event, and unlocked 100% of the Steam Acheivements. The Multiplayer is already dead, as only 1 of the 6 game modes is available, and my friends and I tired of it within minutes.This is a massive let down. It has the look and feel, and depth of play, of a cheap Android or iOS game. It is not worth the £8 I paid for it on Pre Order, and it is definately not worth the £12 they are charging for it now!

At first, the game is extremly easy, you three star every level in the first group.While at the third boss battle, you are dissapointed that the boss has a better vehicle when you do, At every start, he leaves you behind, so you have to take him out using weapons or drive past him.

Sadly it seems the game is targeted at 12 years old. It would be great if Codemasters fixed the wonky controls and created a DLC that added longer and harder tracks.			"

												Avoid this trash if you're looking for online multiplayer because :1) The multiplayer community is completely DEAD. According to Steam Charts, the average number of players for this crap since March 2016 has been around 8. I'm not joking. Just 8.2) I must warn you that there is NO lobby for multiplayer. Also, the matchmaking screen NEVER tells you how many people are playing online or how long you'd need to wait for the next match. The matchmaking screen is totally useless.3) For the past few months, there have been many players seeking help for technical issues related to the game. However, the developer has never answered any of these questions on the Steam forum. Why is that? It's because the developer has been busy with a new project called Dirt Rally, which I'm sure has become their new cash cow.  Therefore, they basically regard this junk as ABANDONWARE. It's pretty naive to expect this irresponsible developer to do anything to improve this game. Code Masters? More like Code Scumbags. Stay away from this crap if you want some multiplayer fun. Your money won't be invested in improving this game. It will just go into the developer's new hobby ""Dirty Rally"".			"

												I will change this review when I can play the game properly.I've played the game on my laptop fine, and it's a lot of fun! Only sad thing is that a tiny skip or bump will slow you down enough to make you lose. I seem to recall Micro-Machines being slightly more forgiving. It could do with a few more modes or tracks, but apart from that, it's a good game.The ONLY reason I'm saying it's not recommended at the moment, is that there are a number of us users that simply can't load the game up on the machine they want to. For example, I have a Win 8.1 i7 hooked up to a 46inch HDTV. I had some friends over, and wanted to give this a go. When we tried to load it, the game would crash back to desktop, refusing to load at all.The devs have released a small patch, but they're yet to fix the crash for me and others... I just hope they don't give up, as I'd like to play it on a big screen, rather than just a tiny laptop.I don't mean to suggest the game is bad, but I recommend people try the demo first, just in case they can't play it either.

												I purchased the four man multipack through Steam so I could enjoy an easy to setup, easy to pickup game with friends. It was supposed to entertain us for a short period in the early evening before we were all ready to paly something else which is what it's marketed as - a low frills game for you and your mates. I was looking forward to a varied subset of game modes like any multiplayer game would offer but was instantly disappointed to find it only offers one. This was never communicated through the marketing material and I can understand why it wouldn't be, who would want to market that your game has no replay value after playing it 10 times? It's a bit like selling an old Playstation 1 Magazine Demo disk as a Retail game - Codemasters have yet again failed to deliver on product.			"

												I had to remove the review because it was too emotional. So let get it straight: singleplayer mode is great. Not ""Game of the Year"" great, but pretty decent. It is very nostalgic if you played Micromachines on Sega Genesis / Playstation / PC, but on the other hand it somehow lacks variety in types of 'landspaces' and cars (no roof  / basement / outdoor tracks, no water tracks and no water types of vehicles - except for one, no toilet and bathroom tracks). But these are very minor gripes. The biggest flaw is multiplayer. Lack of variety in multiplayer (only one game mode!) considerably kills replayability and online activity, which is sad, because single player features many interesting modes. Also the price is not quite justified. For the price lower on 30% you may get Blaze Rush - a pretty good arcade racing game (inspired by another great old school racing game - Rock n' Roll Racing , with very good multiplayer mode and ability to connect straight away to somebodies' game). As reported the singleplayer campaign consist only about 4 hours of gameplay on 18 tracks, which will repeat two or more times during the campaign, which is quite short and may be an issue for some players.I cannot recommend buying the game right now, it is better to wait for a sale (30% or more). But you can try demo, and buy the game mostly for singleplayer.Hope the developers add more multiplayer modes; otherwise this game may vanish in other Steam games very fast.			"

												Game is very good fun and harks back to the days of Micro Machines V3 on PS1 which I used to play with my mates all the time.  Unfortunately the online is currently unplayable (for me anyway) due to insane lag.  I can't believe it's my internet connection as I have very fast speed and ping and other online games are fine.  And given that the mulitplayer is the only real point of this game, it's a bit of a digital door stop at the moment.Would be interested to know if others get smooth races online?			"

												I was looking forward to playing this game, but can't get the resolution to a playable setting. Very disappointing. The game defaults to a lower screen setting so you have mess around with your pc desktop setting just to get the start screen on. I corrected the settings to my computer. It dropped to the lowest resolution. Corrected it again the screen went completely black, but played the sounds. Couldn't get into screen resolution to change resolution down.

The tracks are quite short which is a shame and though there is not much to the single player championships, there is massive repeatability with online and local multiplayer.Overall, a great revisit to a classic game.

												So they didn't call this Micro Machines V5, yet it's still Very much that but they went with another name. Toybox Turbos. Bought it during the 2016 Summer Sale, and also gave it to my friends. Creating Multi is a bit confusing looks very unfinisched in that sense. And first time around also felt some Rubberbanding. Day afer we played again no rubberbanding. I have played MMV3 quite a bit almost had every Cup. And that game was very much twitchy gameplay. Tons a fun. This comes very close to it, feels a tad bit slower can't explain why or how. But its fun and miss allot of tracks variaty that V3 had. Then again this game is cheaper in comparison and you get still tons of crazy fun Top Down Racer, just not as much cars/tracks. Hopefully Codemasters will continue their Top Down Racing games in the future and hopefully expand on this one. With either an actual expansion or later iteration. Where i personally hope they keep it a bit crazy and hopefully add cool features. Is this game worth it, i say yes at the current writing of this playing experiance i don't have many hours in it yet. But i still intend to put more Hours in it and ofc play with my friends and hear them Rage/Rant/Cheer/Laugh how cool/unfair/annoying and what not the game is.			"

												You won't see ""Micro Machines"" mentioned anywhere in this game, but if you played the MM games in the 90's and miss them, you will love Toybox Turbos. Codemasters have done a really good job in replicating the feel of the original. Replacing the old tile-based maps with 3D ones really adds to the feel of just racing cars around whatever was lying about on the table. It's full of nice details too. Some of the spoof books and fake brand names on the track are quite witty, and when you score a point, the car bounces and spins just like in MM. The single player is longer than it looks. There's the usual kind of unlock-driven progression that you expect from modern racing games, but that is very much downplayed: you unlock by driving through coins in-race, so you can't ever run out; unlocks are cheap, so there's no ""grinding"".But if you're buying this game it won't be for the single-player alone. Multiplayer is where it's at. Because there's no real in-game communication, playing against randoms is not that fun, but great Steam integration makes it easy to play with up to three friends, whether they're near (at the same computer) or far (playing on their own computers). Multiplayer can be a bit unfair occasionally: sometimes the physics is a little implausible, and the wrong player gets taken out or one player survives a crash they really shouldn't be able to, but TBH Micro Machines had just the same problem, and this element of randomness actually helps stop the gameplay feeling overly competitive.An update added Oculus Rift support. I wouldn't say the Rift is ideally suited to what is at heart a social game, but it's a neat addition. You feel like you can reach out and pick up the little cars. The scale feels a bit off, and the loading screens are really disorienting, but apart from that it's a good integration and an unexpected bonus.The only shortcoming really is that the only controller supported is the XBox 360. I hoped I could use it with some no-name controllers, but I was disappointed. It only really needs a stick or D-pad and a couple of buttons for accelerate and brake (and you won't be pressing brake often), so it's hard to see why they couldn't have added support for arbitrary controllers. You can still use the keyboard, so even if you've only got one 360 controller, you can just fight over who gets it. Other additions I'd like to see are helicopters (remember the helicopters in Micro Machines? they were really hard), and even a map designer, but the game is complete as it is.I've already had lots of fun with this game: having a quick race on my own, with friends when they come to visit, or at a LAN party (bearing in mind the four-player limit). I don't know anyone who hasn't enjoyed playing it, and if you remember saving up your pocket money for one of the old Micro Machines games, you certainly won't regret spending a few quid on this spritual successor.

												Toy box Turbos Do you like wacky racing where randomness and sheer luck determines the winner?Well step right up, because then Toybox Turbos is right up your alley. This game is Micromachines in everything but name. If you loved the old MM games you won’t be completely disappointed. You still drive small cars around in different household environments. The feel is still there. The graphics are excellent. The game IS fun, but unfortunately it has a lot of flaws dragging it down…That being said, here is my list of complaints:Worst of all, the game is physics based. That doesn’t mean realistic cars, but rather random cars. You bounce around randomly. Sometimes a mine will turn you upside down and you must turtle your way around; and sometimes you’ll be blown way forward, landing perfectly on all four wheels. Sometimes you’ll hit a small bump and your car will turn 180 degrees. Good luck making a three point turn to get back on tracks. And should you have the misfortune to drive into an object you’ll find that you can’t just steer to one of the sides to get free. Nope, you have to slowly back away then steer away.Enjoy almost driving over the edge, think you are gonna make it and then slowly slide over the edge after all. Real nice waste of time in a racing game.The power-ups just add to the randomness, but don’t add much fun. Some are useless like the EMP while other are overpowered like the instant kill hammer. Your luck in getting power-ups often dictates who wins and looses.The singleplayer experience is short. You’ll have completed everything with all achievements in a couple of hours. …Which is lucky, because this is one of those games that locks away content, forcing you to chore through singleplayer, even if you just want to play with friends.And speaking of playing with friends. I hope you like the “elimination” gamemode, because that’s the only gamemode in multiplayer. You literally have no options other than selecting stage, cars and weapons on/off.There are NO fun cars. Remember the planes, boats, helicopters and tanks from the old Micromachines (1+2) games? No? Neither does Codemasters. Well, we got a tank but it doesn’t shoot, so it’s basically just a car. There are a decent number of different cars but they all mostly feel the same.All stages have basically the same layout. Just a bland mix of twists and turns. None of them stand out in any way.No level editor.Definitely a lack of tunes. You feel like you hear the same two songs over and over!Some stages have hazards. Problem is some hazards which change. A volcano spits fireballs in random locations. Some cue balls roll back and forth. This again just adds to the randomness. Are you lucky to slip past or do you crash?Toybox Turbos is fun because you race small cars on funny sceneries against friends. But any racing game like this is equally fun. Once the novelty of not-Micromachines wears off you are left with a pretty poor and unpolished game.I can recommend dusting off the old SEGA or Amiga and play Micro Machines Turbo Tournament '96, instead.4/10			"

												This is the best experience on oculus rift I've seen yet.  It feels like I'm really in the room playing with matchbox cars.When a race is done, the view is as iff you're still driving down the track, which causes a little barfiness.  But that's something that'll work out in time.  The classic view mode view is barfy too because every player steering input changes the view.  If the camera followed the track, that probably wouldn't happen.  The rest of the game is nausea-free though.			"

												All Codemasters had to do was remake Micro Machines (made by them so can't of been too problematic) as it was on the PSX etc. Instead they made this. Single Player is fairly decent but multiplayer is appaling. Quite often people vanish and can only see their own car, whilst others are left racing invisible people, even without that most 'races' are over within 2 laps if you're lucky. Why there's no actual race mode for multiplayer is beyond me. All in all I'm glad someone bought this for me rather than me waste the small amount it costs.			"

												It's the genuine Micro Machines experience, minus the branding. It was even made by Codemasters.The game's beauty is undeniable. Look at those cool, colorful tracks filled with everyday items! Although the tracks are short, they are filled with interesting details. Sadly, the game doesn't have many of the more ""out there"" elements of other Micro Machine games: dropping on the floor and jumping back on a table, garden/beach/museum levels or boat races.All cars look really nice and are very well modeled. You can even see the screw under your car when you turn over. Locked cars are in their ""retail boxes"" and you unbox them when purchasing them with game coins. That's just brilliant. You can also recolor them, which is a nice touch.The game is fairly short and not too hard, but considering this is a game about toy cars, I'd say those are a plus. Toybox Turbos is just a really nice game to have in the Steam catalog to fill that tabletop racing niche.			"

												I don't know about the background and licensing of this game but it is effectively Micro Machines V5 and as such it carries on a series that I have been very fond of for decades. It has the excellent table top racing you will know and love if you have played any of the Micro Machines games. They have slightly changed the camera so that it follows the car, this makes it a lot easier for people not familiar with the top town view but you can turn on the old school camera if you prefer. There is a good variety of vehicles, both old favourites and new ones. The disappointing part however was the number of tracks and the length of the single player campaign. It feels like there are significantly fewer tracks and more limited locations compared to V4. So overall it is an enjoyable game but nostalgia for the Micro Machines games made me expected it to be better.			"

												I think this is a good example of a good, not great, budget game. The visuals are quite well done and it copies the Micro Machine games quite well, which only makes sense in this case. You don't really miss the licensing but this game really is light on content in every conceiveable way.What could have been an all-time classic is relegated to bargain bin fun. It's well worth the purchase at 75% off, or in a bundle, but nothing less due to the lack of content and scale. It's a great multiplayer game and kid friendly in difficulty and presentation. It's just a shame it wasn't bumped up to a fully developed title. It really has everything to be made a classic if it only had the content.			"

												Aaah, Toybox Turbos, a game in 2014 made by other than Codemasters, the ones who started a legend - Micro Machines. They do longer own the title name which is a big shame but, this didn't stop them from making this spiritual sucessor of Micro Machines...V4...I think. Either way, onto teh poit. Die-hard fans or any one getting into the racing genre, should get his? Absolutely, especially with a 75% off discount on it! It's hardly updated these days but doesn't mean the game is mega dead. People, somehow still play it and I got the achievement I needed to make sure I 100% clear this game.You are given one car only, you can unlock the rest by yourself by grabbing these shiny coins around the tracks, and trust me, you'll eb grabbing a lot, once I tell you this. People said this game is easy, it's not as easy as you think. Ofcourse, the first world is mega easy, each world contains a set of different events, not just races but challenges, and these has leaderboards, which is fun. After all event are clear or at a certain given amount of stars is reach, the boss can now be dueled. Win against him, and the vehicle's yours. Basically, a pink slip.After World 2, things start getting harder, and harder like, it makes you avoid the coins you need to buy the cars you want. So that's already something good aboutt he game - it might be short, but it's all pretty challenging if you're not excellent in racing games - I do okay and I still manage to fail here and there sometimes.Now for multiplayer - sad part of it, has one mode only, which is just like The MM games = stay offscreen behind, your out and you lose points, depending of your position. Be the only one in teh screen and you'll get teh maximum points of the round, and along with weapons and madness, while can be repetitive after a while, it's a blast. I haven't tried locally because I don't have that many friends with me at this moment but online proved actually fun.If you have some real life friends to play with, get this and gift them this too, unless they have it too. It's major fun for the whole family. The graphics and visuals are cartoony and gets that Micro Machines appeal.I'll give it a solid 8 out of 10, get it on full price if you want Codies to deserve the money or get it discounted for 75%off, this game is at the very bargainy price, perhaps right too.

												It's great for a local PVP session Micro Machines style. As far as I can tell they cloned their older franchise pretty thoroughly.

												Toybox Turbos is an unexpected gem; a playful and light-hearted game in amongst Codemasters' typically more serious lineup. It lets you relive your young self's fantasies of racing toy cars around courses made up of toys and other household objects.The art style is perfect, with a lot of attention to detail, such as screws on the bottom of cars and fake brands & books making up parts of the courses. The audio effects and soundtrack are on point, with satisfying clunks navigating the menus and lively music playing during races. The visual fidelity isn't the best, but it doesn't seem to matter much as the camera is relatively zoomed out and usually moves quite fast. The feel of the driving is spot on, and the multiplayer is an absolute blast.Toybox Turbos is a fantastic little modern take on overhead racers of the past and well worth your time.			"

												So they didn't call this Micro Machines V5, yet it's still Very much that but they went with another name. Toybox Turbos. Bought it during the 2016 Summer Sale, and also gave it to my friends. Creating Multi is a bit confusing looks very unfinisched in that sense. And first time around also felt some Rubberbanding. Day afer we played again no rubberbanding. I have played MMV3 quite a bit almost had every Cup. And that game was very much twitchy gameplay. Tons a fun. This comes very close to it, feels a tad bit slower can't explain why or how. But its fun and miss allot of tracks variaty that V3 had. Then again this game is cheaper in comparison and you get still tons of crazy fun Top Down Racer, just not as much cars/tracks. Hopefully Codemasters will continue their Top Down Racing games in the future and hopefully expand on this one. With either an actual expansion or later iteration. Where i personally hope they keep it a bit crazy and hopefully add cool features. Is this game worth it, i say yes at the current writing of this playing experiance i don't have many hours in it yet. But i still intend to put more Hours in it and ofc play with my friends and hear them Rage/Rant/Cheer/Laugh how cool/unfair/annoying and what not the game is.			"

												You won't see ""Micro Machines"" mentioned anywhere in this game, but if you played the MM games in the 90's and miss them, you will love Toybox Turbos. Codemasters have done a really good job in replicating the feel of the original. Replacing the old tile-based maps with 3D ones really adds to the feel of just racing cars around whatever was lying about on the table. It's full of nice details too. Some of the spoof books and fake brand names on the track are quite witty, and when you score a point, the car bounces and spins just like in MM. The single player is longer than it looks. There's the usual kind of unlock-driven progression that you expect from modern racing games, but that is very much downplayed: you unlock by driving through coins in-race, so you can't ever run out; unlocks are cheap, so there's no ""grinding"".But if you're buying this game it won't be for the single-player alone. Multiplayer is where it's at. Because there's no real in-game communication, playing against randoms is not that fun, but great Steam integration makes it easy to play with up to three friends, whether they're near (at the same computer) or far (playing on their own computers). Multiplayer can be a bit unfair occasionally: sometimes the physics is a little implausible, and the wrong player gets taken out or one player survives a crash they really shouldn't be able to, but TBH Micro Machines had just the same problem, and this element of randomness actually helps stop the gameplay feeling overly competitive.An update added Oculus Rift support. I wouldn't say the Rift is ideally suited to what is at heart a social game, but it's a neat addition. You feel like you can reach out and pick up the little cars. The scale feels a bit off, and the loading screens are really disorienting, but apart from that it's a good integration and an unexpected bonus.The only shortcoming really is that the only controller supported is the XBox 360. I hoped I could use it with some no-name controllers, but I was disappointed. It only really needs a stick or D-pad and a couple of buttons for accelerate and brake (and you won't be pressing brake often), so it's hard to see why they couldn't have added support for arbitrary controllers. You can still use the keyboard, so even if you've only got one 360 controller, you can just fight over who gets it. Other additions I'd like to see are helicopters (remember the helicopters in Micro Machines? they were really hard), and even a map designer, but the game is complete as it is.I've already had lots of fun with this game: having a quick race on my own, with friends when they come to visit, or at a LAN party (bearing in mind the four-player limit). I don't know anyone who hasn't enjoyed playing it, and if you remember saving up your pocket money for one of the old Micro Machines games, you certainly won't regret spending a few quid on this spritual successor.

												I bought this game just for VR. It's a nice try but the make so many mistakes:- It automaticaly resets the view on loading screens. Every time you make yourself a comfortable distance (because the panels are far to close) it resets itself on the next loading screen.- The controls should be directional. That whould make it far nicer to control.- When a race is finished they move faster across the track in a finishing anmation. This is way to fast. I always get sick.- Also when the race ist finished and on loading screens a screen gets fixed in your view. Never do that in VR!!! It's so annoying like someone holding a paper in your face.- It dosn't support the actual oculus drivers. They didn't manage to update this for 6 months now. I downgraded my drivers but it's still super complicated to get the game running. You need to alt+enter it out of fullscreen, move it on the oculus screen and alt+enter it to fullscreen again. Sometimes the game crashes when you do this...The game is nice, but: Don't buy this for VR ! "

												With almost 10 hours of my life wasted on this game I must say I don't regret it. This game is very entertaining and works very well the Steam Controller. It's a great game to play with friends and family on the big screen as well.			"

												I was looking forward to playing this game, but can't get the resolution to a playable setting. Very disappointing. The game defaults to a lower screen setting so you have mess around with your pc desktop setting just to get the start screen on. I corrected the settings to my computer. It dropped to the lowest resolution. Corrected it again the screen went completely black, but played the sounds. Couldn't get into screen resolution to change resolution down. Uninstalled and reinstalled hoping to start again, but it went back to black screen. Gave up because all the fix info say you have to create an instuction in the game folder. I don't understand why we have to do all this to get a game to work			"

												It has a very silly camera setting for online gameplay. When you are ahead you can't see the coming road and when you fall back a bit, you can't see yourself. Makes me think how well the supercars 2 was made.			"

												As a spiritual successor to the NES Micro Machines game, Toybox Turbos is near note perfect. As a standalone arcade style racing game, Toybox Turbos is pretty near perfect as well. There's not a ton of variety to the vehicles, and the lack of speed boats and helicopters is a shame, but it's a solid 4 hours of distilled fun in single player and delightful in multiplayer.			"

												Same setup as a phone app that met micromachines back when you could get cd-roms in cereal. It is really bad. worth 1$ maybe but really really bad. Worst about it is that the camera doesn't follow you but what ever wierd system it wanna go on it's owned, which makes it so hard to turn or see what is up ahead that you are gonna hit, or just that you can't prober see if you are even touching the ground so you can turn. Just a NO, don't waste your time or money.			"

												This game is basically renamed Micro Machines!If you plan to play solo, consider that:- I got 100% completion with all achievements under 3 hrs- there is not much to do after thatIf you plan to play online, consider that:- there are not many people to play with- netcode is kinda unreliableIf you plan to play 4 people on one couch:- there is probably no better game for that- this game is totally uber-fun when played together- this game is meant to be played 3-4 people on the same screenIf you pay full price and play solo, you will be really disappointed.If you pay few pennies for Humble Bundle and play together with friends, you will never regret. I did the second and am really happy. I miss boats, gardens, rockets and few other from old-school micro machines from 90's, but maybe that will change.			"

												Great handling, good track design, colorful and not-too-demanding graphics, lots of unlockables, online and hotseat multiplayer (though with gamepad only), achievements and trading cards as well. Only downside is the somewhat steep price at 14.99E- (currently) Definitely add to your wishlist and grab it when it's on sale, you will enjoy this one!			"

												Nice casual top down racing title, very similar to the old Micro Machines games. In fact if you've played any of them, you will immediately recognize a lot of recycled bits and pieces from those titles.The game offers what it advertises, and is enough fun to complete the single player.The game would probably really shine in multiplayer, but I've yet to find an online game... which might indicate a small player base.If it is on special, I would recommend it.

												PROS* It's the best local multiplayer game I know (tons of fun with friends on a couch)* Online multiplayer works equally fine * Singleplayer mode is fun & has some nice game modes* Graphics are nice and funny* You don't need a high end gaming pc for it :D* Very easy to play even for non gamersCONS* Had to use some tricks to get it run on win 10 (not sure if this is still a problem)* Singleplayer mode is a bit short and finished in a few hours* Could use some DLC (new maps and game modes)It's a lovely party game. Get it, play it with friends. You want regret it :)			"

												Aw, this game... I got addicted so fast! It's cute and easy and fast to complete. Several campaings to race through with different kinds of racing. I enjoyed all of them - every single track. They get a little bit harder for every campaign but I found one track on the next to last campaign being the most frustrating racing I ever did. It took me forever to complete! But, even though most of the non-successful losses tested my anger-managment, I found every victory worth celebrating! My mood swung greatly during the course of this game. I highly recommend it.I'm also an achievement-hunter and could get all of them within four hours!			"

 A modern Micro Machines! An absolute blast to the past and everything about this game is as simple as can be (very child friendly!). Great for a quick 10 minute race with a friend, not sure I could spend much longer playing it, but thats not to say its bad. Find it on sale, its not too content heavy (and nor was it designed to be). 6.5/10 "

												Sitting on the couch with my car/truck/boat-obsessed toddler, scrolling through my Steam library wondering what he would enjoy watching... Come across this and realize it's perfect. Son gets to point out buses and race cars while dad collects achievements. Win-win. Only problem is he enjoys the vehicle select screen more than the races themselves. I may return to the game once he's old enough to actually play with me.			"

												This game is a lot of fun especially if you can get 4 friends together local.  A go to game on games night.  Its simple, fun and offers lots of laughs while you nudge your buddy on a cliff or unleash the mallet.  The only real complaint I have is that there could be more tracks but this game does go on sale for about $5 often so its great for the price.			"
