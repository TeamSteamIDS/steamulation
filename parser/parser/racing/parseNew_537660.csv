												I have been searching for a game like Slicks 'n Slide for years now, and this is as close as any has gotten.The controls are fine.  You can choose between the sensible default 'Relative' controls (thrust, brake, turn left, turn right) and 'Absolute' (accelerates you in the direction being pressed) which... would probably take some getting used to.The handling feels a little wooden.  I would've liked some more sliding around corners, but it still takes some skill to get around the tracks fast.The tracks are fine.  More would be welcome, of course, but none of them are awful or anything.  Rather a handful of decent tracks than hundreds of filler.The camera, like the controls, can be set from 'Dynamic' which zooms in on the action, to 'Static' which shows the entire track on screen.  Just like good ol' Slicks 'n SlideOnline play is available, but honestly, I got it for local multiplayer and for that purpose this game is more than worth it.  While you can't define your keys (like in Slicks 'n Slide) at least it allows two players to use the keyboard.			"

												Awesome Retro-Racer. The upcoming graphic overhaul looks nice. I'm looking for the confirmed online Time Trial Mode. "

												This game appears to be total waste of money. The amount of content vs. price seems to be off. The weird lag/DPC spikes probably could be done away with if the game had in any way sensible contol scheme. However, the controls work in such way that you POINT into the direction where you'd like to drive. This is unintuitive and completely unlike ANY other top-down view racing game that let you actually steer into the direction you like to steer at.			"
