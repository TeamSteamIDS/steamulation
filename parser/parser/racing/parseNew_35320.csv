												Insane 2 is a fun arcade style off road racing game set in photo realistic exotic environments. The controls are basic, and feel great. Easy to pickup, play and know what you're doing. Left and right to steer, gas to go forward, brake is also reverse and turbo to boost forward. The longer you hold the turbo, the faster you go. After time the turbo will regenerate itself. The game is full of insane jumps and you only go one direction in the air. So even a small jump can send you flying straight and costing you valuable seconds. If you wreck your vehicle or flip it, there's a respawn button that gives you full turbo boost to get you back into the action. There is even a mini map, a full sized map and an 8 way camera to look left, right and behind you. Its a simple game anyone can quickly master. Adults, children, drunks at an arcade. There are a lot of vehicles to unlock in four categories. 4x4, SUVs, pickups, trucks (like dump trucks and semmis), and extreme vehicles with giant tires.This game would feel at home in an arcade, but there are so many cups with a variety of events that you can play for dozens of hours without playing the same event twice. The game has 10 event types spread out over an overwhelming 150 events on 20 maps in dozens of cups. These 10 event types are where the game shines. This variety kept me engaged.You have the standard race type that has you racing through checkpoints over two or three laps. Then there's the knockout that eliminates the vehicle in last place every 30 seconds. Jamboree starts the vehicles facing one another and green lights a random gate out of several, sending vehicles on a mad dash to go through it. This accumulates points, and the first to lets say 100 wins. The racers are quick to react and turn without hesitation. You have a strategy to waste your boost getting to the current gate or wait for the next random gate to go for it. Gate hunt that has 30 gates and the one that passes through the most gates wins the event. Pahthunter forces vehicles to go through all 30 gates. The first one through them all is the winner. You make your own path and do them in the order you want to. Zone Patrol has you capturing gates. The last person through a gate, gets a point for each second that gate is owned. The first to 300 or so points gets declared the winner.Capture the Flag has you racing to get a flag and hold onto it with each second adding a point to your score. The first to 100 wins. You can get 10 points or so for driving through green light gates with the flag. Its like Jamboree, but only one driver can get the extra points. I found this event fun, just playing keep away from the other drivers. Here's the thing though, having a GIANT flag on top of your vehicle means it rolls easy. So keep it straight, no sharp turns. If you ram someone with the flag, you get the flag, as long as they've held it for a second. This results in some big pile ups.Now we have the difficult event types. The ones that stand out as challenges from the fun of the others. Greed will drop bronze, silver and gold boxes from the sky. You can see them on your mini map and giant lights leading up to the sky. They're each worth 5, 10 and 15 points. The first to 100 is the winner. Retrieve the flag has the pack first driving to the flag then taking it back to the big home base for points up to 100 or so. Pursuit is the final and most dreaded event type. You need to follow a helicopter and stay in its spotlight with each second in the spotlight giving you a point. Since its a helicopter, it can turn on a dime. At least the chopper sticks to a set pattern and never deviates. These pursuits are marathons that have lasted up to 30 minutes.Pursuits manage to accentuate the intelligence of the other drivers. They can adapt quicker than I could after 16 hours, yet they seemed to intentionally let me catch up. I'd be in last place with no points and the leader would have 99 points. Instead of simply winning and forcing me to restart... its as if the game then let the 2nd - 5th place vehicles catch up points wise as I did. Sure when I got up to third place in points, the game gave me a struggle, but its the fact that it let me still feel like I have a chance. It still made it seem like it was struggling to win and wasn't just stopped like a dog waiting for you to chase it.Even if the game has only 20 maps spread out across 4 continents (North America, Africa, Eurasia and Antarctica), it felt like with the constantly changing objectives, each objective was like a fresh route. Since this is off road racing, these aren't just courses, these are maps and you can roam freely and take any path you want to make it through the next checkpoint or objective. Go over a bridge, dive into a gorge, go under the bridge, go up an 80 degree canyon wall with little effort. You can't get knocked off course, because the entire map is a course. In fact, the entire map loops. So if you captured the flag with the pack chasing you, don't turn around, keep going to the east, you'll pop out on the west half of the map still going east. Its seamless and a beautiful way of not having invisible walls or borders.Because these are realistic environments, the game has limited resources when it comes to diversity with only desert, dirt, grass and arctic tundra. It still felt like they made each map feel unique through gimmicks here and there. A lumbermill, a low riverbed with a broken skyway road over it, a desert ghost town, a railroad with an engine that will ram and destroy vehicles, a beach, a swamp, a desert oasis with rhinos running around, and a freighter stuck in ice are a few examples of the gimmicks. There are even a few challenging maps that have blinding thunder storms, but luckily gates are always lit up on screen and marked on your mini map.There is a quick race mode and a career mode that spans across four championships. Competitors challenge for beginners, World Tour for the first half of the game. Manufacturers contest has you playing and competing against vehicles of a specific category. Completing each cup and category gives you permanent boosts in one are for all vehicles. For those that like a challenge, there is the Pro Club for the second half of the game. This championship when you're done with most everything else. The difficulty is amped up. Sixteen hours in, I've only just completed a few of the cups in the Pro Club. Each championship has several cups. Each cup has between four to seven events that are themed for the most part. Like Africa, Hostile Weather or Capture the Flag.When you start a career, you select a faceless gender and then one of three crews that give you a bonus to speed, boost or handling. You're given an SUV. Every event that you place in the top 3 unlocks a new event or two and gives you cash to upgrade your vehicle's body, engine or suspension. Each of these three upgrades will increase a few different stats for the vehicle's speed, acceleration, booster, off-road and durability. You can easily see the stats to compare vehicles. Some events even give you a skin credit to unlock a new skin from two extras per vehicle. The smaller vehicles slow to a crawl in the water, while the big ones just motor on through. Big vehicles are top heavy and can roll over easier to cost you time. I would have preferred that larger vehicles can ram through things for the cool factor, but even the small 4x4s can ram down a telephone pole.There is a multiplayer mode, but since this game was released in 2012, there don't seem to be any servers. You can easily make your own or play local co-op. With everything said, four hours into the game, it crashed and I lost my save file. It only happened once, but its a testament to the game that I just kept right on playing.			"

												The first Insane game (also spelled 1nsane) was released in 2001. While not insanely successful (as far as i know), it was a fun off-road arcade racer with lots of game modes and tons of maps and cars to choose from. (It even had a cop car and a hover-craft sci-fi racer thingy)Insane 2 continues this line, being far from a realistic racing game, but immensely fun, if you don't take it too serious. Expect lots of jumps and brutal crashes. The game has quite a few cars, maps and racing modes (from classic racing to capture the flag). Gameplay-wise, Insane 2 isn't too difficult. The AI has some dumb moments, but luckily, these are relatively few and far-between. The Physics can seem strange to someone expecting a simulator, but their do their job. Ice and mud will make you glide around, for example. One annoying thing is, that the car will turn into rubber when you're carrying the flag (during CTF and RTF games). While the cars do take damage, it seems mostly cosmetic until the car breaks down completely, when a reset will fix it and bring you right back into the action. The game looks very satisfying and seems well optimized, running very well even on mid and low-end machines. Graphics-wise there's very little to complain about, really. I can't really say much about the multiplayer, as i have yet to test it.All in all, the game is well worth your time, IF you don't expect a realistic racing game and if you enjoy over the top races. Probably the biggest downside, is the current price on Steam. If you can get a better deal, take it!			"

												Insane 2 is basically an add-as-little-as-possible sequel to the original 1nsane. That would be great if they hadn't also removed features. If you're looking for a cheap, reasonably enjoyable offroad arcade racing game, Insane 2 is a good option when you find it on sale. (I got it for $1 on BundleStars) I can't recommend paying the full price, under almost any circumstances. See why below.Here's what you should know:You race in tournaments, you get points to upgrade cars, you unlock cars, you race some more. Each race may take you a couple of tries to beat while you learn the track. The cars have different liveries, but you won't care much because none of them are interesting.The AI seems to value your loss more than its own victory, so it'll sacrifice itself to take you out. From memory, this seems to be the same AI from 1nsane.You can miss checkpoints, which means you'll have to backtrack if you got bounced around one. This combined with the kamikaze AI can sometimes be frustrating.There're no licensed cars or brands.This game has full controller support (at least for the wireless 360 controller) though it isn't listed on the Steam page.If you played the first game I have bad news for you: The free roam mode is gone, there is no mod support, and there are no available mods. So all those fond memories of driving around the open areas trying to do barrel rolls, finding new skins online, discovering that you could make a new area with just a black and white elevation map, and playing as a gnu on wheels are going to have to stay memories. For a lot of people this is a good reason to skip this game, and I can't disagree. If you can see past that though, you'll still enjoy the racing.Insane 2's distinguishing features are few. It is an offroad racing game and very little more than that. It doesn't have the simulator-esque realism of DiRT and it doesn't have the grand scale tracks and weather of Fuel but it's a fun, arcadey offroad racer.			"

												Kinda like a low budget Motor Storm, but personally, I easily prefer this. The graphical design is appealing, and the gameplay is fun. Easy to learn, hard to master - this game is both relaxing and challenging, and it will take some hours to complete the career with gold medal in every event. Great value for money I would say.			"

												Light version of the MotorStorm games (PlayStation).Other similar games: Fuel, Pure, MX vs. ATV, ATV Offroad Fury, FlatOut, Dirt.The good:- Good/OK graphics, sound and music.- Smooth and arcadish racing with good UI and no sluggish handling.- No irritating learning curve or deep intro/menu/loading. Only good racing.- SP, split screen and MP with great maps and different modes.- A lot of different cars with each their different handling.- Car tuning.- Steam achievements.- Some replay value: just for the fun of it, or for trying to get gold medals.The bad:- Maps and overall racing could have been more immersive like fx. MotorStorm Apocalypse.- Car damage could have been better.- Car tuning is very simple.- Dead MP.- Replay value is not huge.- No Steam trading cards.If you are lucky like me, you'll get it on sale or in a bundle.The review is written considering paying full price for the game, and not taking into account the MP is dead.Recommended. 7,5/10.

												Not the highest budget, best looking, or most fun handling racing game ever made, for sure, but fairly enjoyable nonetheless. Personally I've never been a fan of games that drift by turning sharper, as opposed to using a button, as it feels like you have less control. However, this game manages to still feel controllable most of the time, despite not feeling as responsive as a game like Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing Transformed (which personally has my favorite driving mechanics of any racing game).I have yet to figure out if there's anything I can do to gain boost meter or if it just refills over time. The boosting doesn't always feel as fast as I'd like, but it changes handling interestingly and is frequently refilled, which is nice. I also haven't played many off-road racing games, so this is a nice change of pace, with lots of bumps and such along the way that can challenge you and send you flying, which is quite fun. Speaking of, the car models, designed to look off-roady, are a nice change of pace from the kinds of racing games I usually play. The AI likes to PIT you and force you into obstacles, but trying to return the favor is more difficult than it seems it should be.If you're a fan of racing games and don't mind a mediocre-but-competent fun little racing game, Insane 2 isn't a bad choice. I wouldn't spend more than $5-10 on it.			"

												A poor man's MotorStorm, but by no means a bad game. You can expect good clean arcade racing fun, and a staggering (and quite silly) number of game modes to choose from, as well as decent graphics and good controls. My only problem with it so far is that the difficulty seems pretty inconsistent.You'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining indie racer.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Targem GamesPublishers: Game Factory InteractiveInitial release: Jan 2012Genre: Racing, Off-Road. Arcade#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): MotorStorm derivative (however MotorStorm is an 1nsane derivative, more on that later)  Exposition, Concurrence and SummationIn2ane is a chaotic arcade off-road racing game. It has your traditional modes as well as what made the original stand out. Pathfinder, gate crasher and capture the flag modes, wherein you and a number of other drivers are placed across from each other on an open map and and must drive to specific locations ensuring chaos prevails. In all honesty, it's a fairly generic game but it's a very well playing one. There are multiple types of vehicles in which they can be driven against each other in certain modes much in the vain of MotorStorm (2006). (1nsane(2001) was doing this 5 years removed. Not to mention the titles in between like Flatout that scratch a very similar itch.)It's got some very basic tuning. As in its essentially just spending some arbitrary points earned in career mode to make a specific vehicle drive better off-road (there is some tarmac), increase acceleration, top speed and so forth. The vehicles and terrain have some decent deformation; the muddy bits indeed cover the vehicle when splashed.  THE GISTIt's not 1nsane but for being a totally different developer and publisher it's a pretty faithful sequel in congruence with the first. Maybe a little more boring as in it doesn't really have the legs so to speak.Follow my curation for moreObligatory Post Review Cathartic RantOne of my first experiences with PC gaming was playing 1nsane, alongside Tzar and Half Life 1 (non steam GOTY edition) on the family computer. Aside from that, Off-Road/Rally games were and still are my goto sort of relaxing – I don't want to start anything else serious right now genres. 1nsane was one of the more unique ones with it's modes and to be frank.. insane suspension physics. This is back when me and ATV Off-Road Fury 2, Test Drive Off-Road and Rallisport Challenge were racking up hours before DiRT ate my entire life. Anyways, I guess the main point of the rant was that In2ane does not feel as special as the first. It feels very, and I hate the term but it feels consolized, dumbed down and generic. Same thing happened with the sequels to Crysis and FEAR. Somewhere between the chaos of making a sequel all the special sauce got used. It just feels a little soulless.			"

												This game is often compared to Motor Storm and is sometimes referred to as the ""low budget arcade version"" (even though 1nsane came out first) but I disagree; I think Insane 2 is definitely the better game. I'm not really a fan of racing games as a rule, but this one really appeals to me because of it's really simple but addictive gameplay.Insane 2 has one of the best atmospheres I've encountered in a racing game and has a smart AI, plenty of game modes, vehicles and tracks to choose from giving you plenty of hours of play, the graphics are also pretty impressive for an arcade racer. Throw a ton of achievements into the mix and you have a near-perfect racing game. While the physics aren't exactly phenomenal, they're a lot better than most other games of the same style (P.A.M. for example), it's just a shame that the online community for this game is almost non-existent now.So if you like arcade racers then you should definitely pick this one up for your collection when it hits the sales. I managed to get it for 75p and it is definitely worth more than that.			"

												This is a great game. It captures the essence of the original Insane, and I would say it improves in every way.Pros:• Diversity in game modes.• Good car handling.• Enough vehicles to suit your driving style.• ""Shiny"" graphics• Good difficulty• A genuine good, solid game• Local split-screen.Cons:• Some of the game modes may cause aggravation further into the game, but not unfairly. Practice makes perfect.• Sometimes it seems like it's impossible to catch up to the lead car, but again, the more you play, the better you get.• Even though there are a selection of cars, you may only find yourself using 4 or so different ones to be in to win.• Multiplayer appears dead.I think a reasonable playthrough could be done in just over 10 hours. I spent a twice that getting 100% in career and unlocking more cars, so 15hrs is possible without overstaying too much.Highly recommended, and it's on sale atm on another site.

Not noted, but it does have gamepad support.+Many vehicles and tracks.+Good graphics for the time+Good arcade style controls+Fun and quick to pick up and play even if only have a few minutes+Runs well on a decent PC.I haven't played it in awhile, but believe it has controller support which is not mentioned. Only minor issue is that it seems like the geography has too little impact on your vehicle, you can go through brush and not get bogged down and barely seems like you are off the main track and don't seem to ""feel"" the bumps enough. 8/10 esp if can pick up on sale for under $10			"

												You know what? This game is kinda sick.First as a disclosure, I got this in a bundle for $3.50cad that I mainly bought for a steam version of FlatOut 2. If anything, I kinda got this game for free.It's a racing game that takes place in multiple open-world locations where you checkpoint race, hold the flag for a bit, claim as many gates as possible, run over the airdrop packages, stay in the helicopter searchlight, as well as problably more gimmicky gametypes (since the further I progress in the singleplayer, the more gametypes they throw at me).The big gimmick is that the world seemlessly loops. It's kind of hard to explain with words, but essentially if you drive far enough left, you actually wrap around to the right side of the map. I don't think I've ever see another game do this before, and it creates a very interesting dynamic. This leads to some incredible maps, such as a map that takes place in a canyon that just endlessly goes down at a super steep angle, reminicent of an SSX run in the off-season.The driving is super straightforward, arcady, and accessable. I love how when you make a sharp turn, the camera pans to the side of your car. It's just a simple thing I mark out for.The boost system is a basic ""once you're out of boost, you have to wait for it to fill back up"" system. It's a huge bummer that it does not use a system like in the Outs of both Burn and Flat, where you get boost for ramming people and getting air, because the map design would lend itself to that. There's tiny bumps everywhere that would encouage people to take a tiny detour for a little Gofast Juice, however with the ""no matter what you have boost"" method of doing things, it's just better to be boring and go as the crow flies to the gate.AI is really good and they give me a run for my money. I can't confim the allogations that they cheat, because I have yet to catch them. It may look like it since their arrows jump when you're in one of the (what I can only call) ""freeroam"" gametypes, but that's only because the map loops in on itself, and it's correcting which direction you're closest to them.I have yet to try multiplayer, so I can't report on whether or not it works. I didn't find any games when I tried, though. Allegedly it only shows games that people on your friends list are hosting, but like I said, I have yet to confirm that.So yeah, if you can get this for cheap, it's totally worth $5 even for singleplayer.

												Short version: Insane 2 is the best game i've played in a long time, but it's not without stupid easily-fixed flaws. It could have been perfect and recommendable to anyone were it not for these issues. As it is it's fantastic but beware of control/viewpoint frustrations.Longer version:It's amazing but annoying at the same time. Obviously a lot of effort has gone into making the game not only fun but also faithful to the predecessor and the developers have succeeded on both counts. Yet there are a handful of problems which smell of either corner-cutting or being ignorant to gamers who like to play games a certain way. 1st problem: (This one will be bigger to some than others) The gamepad controls are non-configurable. Yes it'll let you use a gamepad, no it won't let you set the controls how you like them. Consequently it maps accelerate/brake to the trigger buttons, which may be the way some people like it but i think this method of controlling speed is dumb. I usually use the right analogue stick, or a face-button if this function is not available. But as i said the game won't let you remap anything. So immediately i'm forced to play on keyboard because i just can't handle stupid controls. Perversely the game DOES let you configure the keyboard controls, so at least in that regard you can have it how you like. (fyi = az,.)2nd problem: There's a choice of only 2 views and neither of them are on-car. Yep, for the first time in a long time a racing game offers no 1st person viewpoint; all you get is a 3rd person view and a slightly zoomed-out 3rd person view, both of which are irritating because they don't rotate the view consistantly to the direction the car is facing. It's bizarre, surely a 1st person view is easier to program than a 3rd person view, yet for reasons that will remain a mystery Targem decided to not to include one. Consequently you'll run into a lot of viewpoint issues particularly during the flag & pursuit events. 3rd problem: This is perhaps a personal preference rather than an arguable flaw as such. The ""King of the Hill"" mode from the first game has been replaced by ""Pursuit"", this is a hateful mode and is poorly recognised with many anti-player features which just make it more irritating than it needed to be. The idea is fairly simple; a helicopter will fly a scripted path with a searchlight directly underneath it, the player scores points by staying in the searchlight. It's fine as an idea but i do wish the developers had allowed more people to test the mode before including it in the game, it's riddled with problems. Firstly, most of the cars at your disposal (especially in the early stages of the game) simply aren't fast enough to keep up with the helicopter, how the AI cars manage it is anyone's guess (they cheat; is the answer). Secondly, when  you get bumped and fall behind you'll need to catch up sharpish which means relying on your nitro boost. But this will run out just before you catch up and then takes so long to recharge that you've fallen behind again. What would've immeasurably improved this mode would've been to give everyone infinite boost. Another annoyance is that the helicopter will change direction without warning and on some of the tracks you have to do several laps just to learn the route and hope the cheating AI doesn't win before you do so. Again; a small fix would've been to have the chevron in the spotlight pointing the direction that the heli's going to take 1 or 2 seconds in advance. As it is the game's shipped with a stupid mode that requires many many attempts (and a boatload of luck) to beat, while the rest of the modes can be challenging but always feel possible. Also regarding modes: The game makes you wait for 4 or 5 championships before giving you a Pathfinder game to play, this mode was always popular in the original game and one of the main selling points, yet I2 doesn't provide you with this fun until you're 40% of the way through. If all the Pursuit maps were replaced with Pathfinder/Gatehunt/Jamboree maps then i'd have been a bit more forgiving toward the game.Those are really the main problems that mark Insane 2 down for me, i love the game and heartily recommend it but it does really get on my tips from time to time. It's a worthy follow-up to one of my all-time favourite games, it looks fantastic, it's well optimised to run on lower-end systems, the racing is close and exciting, there are tons of events and a good variety of vehicles. I just wish more attention had been paid in certain areas. 8.5/10PS: There's also no speedo, even though the stats say a car is faster there's no guarantee that it actually is, especially when they all jump the same distances.PPS: Multiplayer: There were no games available on 3 seperate attempts to play. And i created a server which sat empty with no one joining for over an hour. Multiplayer is only for those who have friends who also play. "

												This is one really fun off-road racer. Solid physics, quite many cars from buggies to monster trucks and visuals that I didn´t expect at first. The dust, ice, mud and water effects look great. The light effects make every jump look like your new wallpaper. The game is fully compatible with the Xbox 360 controller and i would imagine also with some steeringwheels or other gamepads. Can´t tell how good it works with the keyboard but I´m almost certain that it works fine.If you like the Motorstorm series or always wanted agame like motorstorm without buying a PS3, Insane 2 is for you.

												How do I convince you that this is worth $15? Well, think about what else that money will pay for. You could get a medium pizza, or buy the attentions of a woman-of-negotiable-virtue. Except both of those are risks to your health, and you can't really enjoy those things more than once. Not without paying for more. But they're cheap and easy, and satisfy a craving. That's this game. Except it's not gross or crawling with bugs. In either the literal or figurative sense.			"

												I've played the original 1nsane. I played the demo I'd gotten on a CD with a magazine, and then I played the full game as soon as I found it. I loved 1nsane. I played the hell out of 1nsane. This, sir, is not 1nsane.It's not bad, but Insane 2 isn't as good as the original. But it is a fun little off-road, open-arena racer. Jamboree, Off-Road Racing and Capture the Flag are still around, and they're mostly good (though the cars seem to roll over way to easily with the flag than in the original). And there are new gaming modes as well. Yeah... about those...I think that Insane 2 suffers more from ""sequelitis"" than anything else. It's bigger than the first game. It's prettier than the first game. It's a lot more frantic than the first game. And it suffers for it.The graphics are incredible. 1nsane wasn't ugly, but this is a very pretty game. The cars don't deform as interestingly in Insane 2, but aside from that, the stages are so good looking. The Thunderstorm stage in particular has so much going on... which leads to my main criticism. There's too much going on. And it distracts (and detracts) from the gameplay.Each race has at least 6 competitors (up from 4 in the original) meaning that there are more cars running around, pushing into you. There's nitro now, which means that everyone is faster, and the racing itself is a lot more frantic (made even more so by the motion blur). On the Thunderstorm stage, your car can be struck by lightning, which looks metal, but if you're trying to play catch-up, and you lose the race because you got hit at the wrong time, it's more than a bit frustrating.The nitro does add a certain something to the racing, and getting upgrade points does give the game some aspect of strategy. Upgrading also changes the looks of the cars (which is always nice). But it keeps reminding me of 1nsane, and stuff that's no longer around.Each league had a pool of cars available (and it seemed as though there were a lot more of them). Vehicles had a differential lock. There was a separate button for repair, and a separate one for recovering the car. And one for righting a car if it rolled over. 1nsane was just... better.Insane 2 introduces a number of new modes. There's Knockout, in which the last competitor through a checkpoint is removed every 30 seconds. Greed is probably the most fun, because you run around the map collecting bronze, silver and gold packages for points (probably a replacement for Demolition, and good riddance to it). And Pursuit, which was invented by the Devil, who laughs maniacally as He forces you to chase His helicopter around through a bumpy, bouncy arena while your competitors keep pushing you off course.Odd that. I started out this review, thinking I'd just lightly criticize Insane 2 while extolling how much fun it is to play. But really, compared to the original, this is no fun at all.			"

												The game isn't bad, but it got boring quick for me. The vehicles handle like they're attached on top of a bracket and just slide from left to right; it doesn't really feel like steering. And they sort of glide over the terrain without responding to it much. The sense of speed is underwhelming too. I'd say that even Super Mario Kart is a more complex and challenging racing game than this. I can see why people like it, it'd be right at home in an arcade and it's passable for that. But if you're looking for anything more, it may not be something you come back to play very often.			"

												Maybe this is just me, but I feel that while this is a just fine arcade-y racer (which is what I typically look for in racing games, ala FlatOut, Burnout, etc and various Kart Racers.) I feel like the bots are just a bit cheap for my taste. Plus, the controls being THIS simplistic don't really mesh with the environments to me like FlatOut does. Not sure I like the boost system either, although with the lack of stuff to run into in In2ane I don't really blame the devs for not using something like Burnout's boost system.Not really my cup of tea, this one. Sad. I wanted to like this one too.			"

												It reminds me of what Need for speed Nitro is for the NFS series. This has a lot of the same game types as the first Insane but its not the same game. Also, the car textures are not much to look at. Code Masters did the first one; if you are looking for something similar, track down FUEL. That is closer to 1nsane.This game is funThis game is fairly repetitiveThis is worth 20 dollars maximumVery arcade style handlingMaps could have been bigger but they look nice and the races are fun.

												This game is a total perversion of the 1nSANE franchise. The original was a pioneer of off-road demo-derby racing that gave the player a feature-rich depth of control like having to customize your suspension and gear ratios to suit the environment and type of competition your next game would be in,  and the procedual damage that would sometimes smash your car into a twisted mess- but perhaps just not enough to prevent you from limping across the finish-line for the win. This is more like mario cart than 1nSANE. It's a cliche booster-gauge 'win points to buy upgrades' racer that has no business posing as a successor to 1nSANE. There isn't even a manual transmission option anymore. And, I could have missed it, but in the couple hours I've spent in the game so far, I didn't see a custom map utility- which was one of the coolest things about 1nSANE.Even if not associated wth the Codemasters masterpiece, this is not a very good racing game. It's half-racer, half-demolition derby, and not enough to be successful at either. Go play Hydro Thunder. It's basically the same darn thing but immensely better.			"

												Sequel of 1nsane. Insane 2 is also awesome offroad racing game. This game has some more modes than 1nsane, but ""Destruction zone"" (one of my favourite) is the only missing. Control is easier than that in 1nsane and you get can use boost (turbo). AI of opponents is unfortunately primitive. I like more the hardcore difficulty level in 1nsane than this easy in Insane 2, but I like this game. The sad part is that I cannot find any server to play online.

												I regret not having found this game back in 2012. I was (am) a huge motorstorm fan. I loved playing motorstorm in split screen with friends, and also alone. The scenery in Motorstorm was amazing, every level different from the next one, the feeling of the cars pretty unique, and the sounds....that boost eating up your car, overusing it till your car exploded and flew right through the finish line.This Insane 2 is not Motorstorm, tries to be the 'Motorstorm' on pc and goes very close. Now that I don't have a PS3 but only a PS4, I can't play Motorstorm and was feeling nostalgic. I found this Insane 2 instead, in 2016....this is why I regret not having found it back in 2012.The graphics, although of course outdated, are still very nice (especially on TV). The feeling is incredibly motorstormish. The levels also, although not very 'full' of props, are nice and remind the crazy stunts of the Motorstorm tracks.Well guess what, because I've written the word 'Motorstorm' a hundred times in this review....yes, it's just like Motorstorm but everything is a little bit worse. It definitely is the title on PC that most resembles the Motorstorm series.....Multiplayer is dead but for splitscreen fun and AI racing I guess it's pretty much a must buy, if you want to feel some Motorstorm on your pc, otherwise just stick to the older Motorstorms on PS3.P.S. it supports perfectly 21:9 ultrawide by editing the config file, and supports the controller (full support analogic).

												Insane 2 is one of those games that really should be played multiplayer, though the BOTS do put up a decent amount of fight. With ten different game modes, multiple maps on multiple continents (and thus, different themes) there are bazillion combinations. And when you add allowed vehicle types (6 types, three vehicles in each, all upgradeable) this allows some insane variations. Ever played vehicular capture the flag? Grab the flag, or take it from someone else by ramming them. Then try to take it through a green gate... and try not to let the flag be taken from you, though it will be difficult as you have no nitro when you hold the flag!  Heavier vehicles have the advantage of holding the flag, but then they are also slower and clumsier. The game is a lot of fun to play and the collisions are done very well, with the car losing parts realistically, though obviously surviving 100 m or more falls onto the valley floor is obviously not survivable in real life. Or 100 mph crash into a pile of rocks and so on. Tried to get on multiplayer, but being a 2012 game, I can't find any one holding a public lobby, which is not unexpected. All in all, Insane 2 is a fine spiritual successor to the original Insane with all the odd game modes that are usually not associated with vehicle games. if you like fast and furious driving games with a lot of crashing, insane jumps, in exotic landscapes, with no preset tracks, this is your game.

												I selected this game for my own Under the Radar category for 2016's Steam Awards. I chose Insane 2 over Targem's own BlazeRush, which is also super fun and underrated, just cause its lesser known, both are great titles overall. Same for Nexus Jupiter and INFRA, check them out too.Insane 2 is the PC Motorstorm. The closest thing to it, and it does it well, better than similar games like FUEL which can get repetitive after awhile. This one, thanks to its vast variety of modes, keeps things fresh. There's even a game of tag, where you can pair up trophy trucks versus pick ups, suvs, buggies and more! Also, a game a la hunt is equally exciting, where you have to get drops as quickly as possible before your opponents, for points. And there's even capture the flag. I recommend this game also for those old-school gamers that remember and have good memories of Smuggler's Run and Shox. Pure arcade fun!			"

												It is a competent racing game. The graphics are pretty good and it controls well, and sounds are good. However it just does not hold a torch to a far superior game like Dirt 3 or Grid 2. It is tied with Shoot Many Robots for having the most mind bendingly generic awful rock music that makes me want to tear my ears off and throw them in a piranha tank, but I suppose that can be fixed at my own disposal by turning off in-game music (which hopefully it allows) and playing my own tunes in Windows media player. The worst complaint I have about the game is that even if you run a perfect race you usually still only finish first ahead of the second place car by a few seconds or less.If you want the best off-road racing game, buy Dirt 3. If you want the best track racing game, buy Grid 2 or NFS Shift. Still, this game is definitely fun and I only paid a dollar for it on sale and that was a steal for a game that is a 7/10,			"

												I can sum up Insane 2 as a cheap erzatz of Flatout. Very arcade oriented, with races never longer than 10 minutes, generally under 5. Carreer is quite long, and all vehicles are unlockable and upradable during it's course. Physics are okay, although sometimes a bit frustrating (bouncy car / bumpy terrain).No servers, I couldn't try the multiplayer.It has a feeling very different from 1sane (1) ! No deformable vehicles here, and there is no simulation aspect. Go back to the old game id that's what you're looking for !			"

												I want to recommend this game but I just can't. It is too old and there are better racing games out there. Pros: -controls are solid. Arcade like but solid-AI is competative-Lots of events to do and cars to unlock-There is actual strategy involved for some of the levels-Graphics are ok, not great but ok.Cons: -There is zero community to play multiplayer-The ""screen shots"" are not, they are concept art only. -The AI is good but sometimes idiotic driving right into walls for no reason-There is no free roam like the first one-way too expensive at full price-early levels are very repetative "

												I'm not going to say that this game is bad; it isn't, it's a perfectly fine arcade off-road racing game.My issue is that the career mode jams too many event types down my throat that I would consider party game nonsense. All I'm here for is to prove that I'm the fastest racer out there, and instead the game would rather me do all these wacky things like chasing the spotlight beam of a helicopter or hunting down randomly dropped packages that parachute onto the map.The driving itself is fine, if simplistic; but the event types just rub me the wrong way. What would have been so wrong about a simple time trial mode?			"

												This game is very mediocre I wanted to like this game because it has charm and potential, but its just not fleshed out enough for me. The racing is frustraiting because this game can't deside if its a serois race simulator or a wacky no holds racer. The control of the car is okay to jerky and responsive, but not frustraiting when trying to corner. However when you take a jump and sudenly go from first to last then can't recover because all the other cars are so evenly matched its not the greatest feeling while playing solo, if that happend in coop i could understand, but take a hint guys in solo I'm the star of the show make me feel like it. Now onto the upgrades; great idea adds depth to the game, terrible exicution all the upgrades save buying new cars are about the same as the last which still holds true for most of the cars aswell, come on guys add some flavor here. Now all of that said I did enjoy this game for a while the ability to use my 360 controller is huge, but the problems I mentioned make this game get stale way to fast.I would skip it unless it's a really good deal or in a bundle of somesort there are much better games outthere of this genre.

												Insane 2 offers a number of innovations in the off-road racing genre. Besides the traditional time trial mode, the game features 9 other game modes, including the popular “Capture the flag”, “Gate hunt” and “Pathfinder”, as well as some new competitions, such as bonus hunting, territory control and helicopter pursuit. All of these modes are also available in multiplayer, with up to eight players participating simultaneously. More than one hundred and fifty races combined into championships and cup competitions take place in Europe, America, Africa and the Antarctic. The game has an enormous variety of long distance tracks: sand and snowy deserts, high-speed roads and impassable cross-country paths, African beaches and deserted Antarctic stations. The game features 18 vehicles of different classes, from buggies to monstrous “Bigfoots”, as well as an additional prototype class. Rating points won in the races can be used to upgrade any of the vehicles, from a selection of 15 running gear, body or engine upgrade alternatives. Each vehicle is furnished with a detailed destruction system. Reaching the end of a course without suffering any losses is an enormous challenge that only a select few are able to accomplish. The opponents, who constantly create extreme situations, aren’t the only danger: players also need to watch out for railway crossings, heavy tanker trucks and even lightning in stormy weather.			"

												Fun arcade racing game that runs well, with good graphics, even on older spec machines. Unfortunately only supports xBox control pad and keyboard, if you don't have an xBox control pad split-screen mutliplayer is locked out. This also means that you won't be able to get one of the achievements as it requires split-screen mutliplayer to be obtained.A driving game that doesn't support using a steering wheel (facepalm).

It looks awesome at HD resolutions and delivers the fantastic gameplay we all remember from the first game. This has a few new game modes the original didn't have which adds to the gameplay a fair bit. A good mix of vehicles and upgrades also. Works great with the controller with the default configuration being ideal.My only complaint is not being able to find anyone online with the multiplayer option. Very confused there aren't tons of people playing this online as the type of gameplay modes this game has lend themselves perfectly to a ton of multiplayer fun. The single player game is awesome though and will keep you occupied for a good length of time, with you also coming back for more time and time again due to it being a great racing game.Highly recommended if the multiplayer online isn't overly important to you.

												What should i say about Insane 2 ?Hm... not really good not really bad, i mean i'm not satified playing this game.- Can't use my controller (But ok since many other racing games out there can't use controller anyway  ==\)- Racing car model not so interesting (can't ya make a beautiful design for the cars ?)- Only a few participant in he race :|  hm.... not so challenging anyway- Checkpoint System. This one is really annoying, if u miss to register your car at any checkpoint in the race, then u will be counted as the last posisition racer, eventhough u're in the first line. So the things u have to do is.... either :1.  u turn around ur car through a hard corner sircuit or 2. Restart the race from the first (Cause sometimes u are about to hit the last checkpoint, but cause of some mistake u miss to register so need to turn around, and by the time ya comeback in the right track, u already left behind so far :DDD )+ Good graphic+ Beautiful panorama design+ Challanging Tracks. It's pretty difficult terrainsOverall... 65 / 100  = Not really good & not really bad also			"

Insane II stays true to the original with updated graphics. Still the same exhilirating racing, still the brutal fighting to stay in control of the game, and still the hilarious viewpoints of your rivals flying over you as they roll to a crash.

												Very fun arcade off-road racing.Pros:* Game modes! Capture the flag, gate hunt, pathfinder, knockout and more. MadMax style action where 6 cars are heading toward the flag or gate from different directions at full speed.* Map is huge tile repeated infinitely. You can drive forever without hitting map edge. Awesome idea that complements game modes - target can be approached from different angle. For example if way east to the base is crowded with opponents you can return flag by going to the west, north or south. Brilliant idea.Cons:* Damage model is very disappointing. Car only loses panels and accessories without drive capability being affected. Only big hits result in ""car broken"" state where all wheels fall off (even when car falls on roof!) and car must be repaired. This is huge downgrade when compared to first 1nsane game where whole car frame could be deformed and watching out not to cripple the car was essential to win.* Cars do not show advantage on given maps/tracks. Buggy class should be dune master while monster class should dominate crazy jumps. Instead every race can be won in random car.I had a good time playing this game. Thanks!After 1NSANE and IN2ANE I'm waiting now for INSAN3 (multiplatform please)!			"

If you continuously go ahead, then you will seamlessly go back to same place. At first it makes me headache, but then I think this is very interesting.Cons:- Maps area is too small- Less varied missions "

												This game is pretty good. However for people looking for more actual racing you might want to skip it unless you like brawling with cars. It gets frustrating for someone looking for just good solid racing to get a mix of racing, gate hunting, gate claiming, capture the flag, return the flag, Greed, and persuit. On a side note I love capture the flag it's like a moving demolition derby track. Pretty fun. On the hate I HATE I STRAIGHT HATE PERSUIT oh and GREED. Both are annoying and seem to last ten times longer than you could ever want. However on giving it a mix of ideas and good wrecking and monster trucks and all that good crash smash fun. I could recommend it.  As a bonus warning the maps loop they seem bigger cause your circling or portalling right back to the same areas. The opponents use this to crazy advantage in certain game modes like Greed that makes you want to put your fist through your screen. Just a heads up. However if your a decent driver you should be able to one up them most of the time. I got gold on most of the attempts first try. Many of them without upgrades, but upgrades are nice.			"

												What should i say about Insane 2 ?Hm... not really good not really bad, i mean i'm not satified playing this game.- Can't use my controller (But ok since many other racing games out there can't use controller anyway  ==\)- Racing car model not so interesting (can't ya make a beautiful design for the cars ?)- Only a few participant in he race :|  hm.... not so challenging anyway- Checkpoint System. This one is really annoying, if u miss to register your car at any checkpoint in the race, then u will be counted as the last posisition racer, eventhough u're in the first line. So the things u have to do is.... either :1.  u turn around ur car through a hard corner sircuit or 2. Restart the race from the first (Cause sometimes u are about to hit the last checkpoint, but cause of some mistake u miss to register so need to turn around, and by the time ya comeback in the right track, u already left behind so far :DDD )+ Good graphic+ Beautiful panorama design+ Challanging Tracks. It's pretty difficult terrainsOverall... 65 / 100  = Not really good & not really bad also			"

												so far, its a bit easy and the physics are way off but the game is fun. maps dont have boarders, to explain, imagine going north off the edge of the map and comming back in on the south, its a nice idea but in play it can become confusing and it shows a great lazyness in creating fake open world maps. other than that, real nice motorstorm inspired not open world game..........also your 2 is backwardsedit: you know what, i take back what i said about the repeating map. What an amazing idea, especially when you only have an east-west connection to make one long track with many different routes.... why dont more games do this?			"

												Once I saw this game existed I had to get it! I was a huge fan of 1nsane, especially the bugs and gameplay, similiar to Smuggler's Run. Insane II stays true to the original with updated graphics. Still the same exhilirating racing, still the brutal fighting to stay in control of the game, and still the hilarious viewpoints of your rivals flying over you as they roll to a crash. Thumbs WAYYYYYY up!			"

												The sequel to the original 1nsane game. Has updated good looking graphics while still retaining most of the fun game-play of the original. Has a wide range of vehicles, upgrades, maps and modes to play with. I recommend it!			"

												Really good offroad-racer with many big maps and cars and competitions, perfect to hear music while playing, decent difficulty, very good controls and handling of the vehicles, graphics are pretty as well, huge amount of content for little money, recommendation!			"

												If you remember the original from 2000 then you'll not be disapointed with Insane 2.Fast and furious and great fun alone or when played against your mates.All of the great mini games from the original are there, although they have been tweaked a little.  However the overall feel of Insane 2 is fun.Give it a go you'll have hours of fun.			"

												Good potential for an arcade racer. To many preassure points to really enjoy. Also no working multiplayer which is promoted.Multiplayer you could call:""not available"" (there seem to be no players / working servers). Some of the Achievements are Multiplayer dependent. Singelplayer is way to repetitive to play it 100%...Difficulty:The difficulty of the KI is not setable. It seems advancing in the campaign but I think it's just their vehicles advancing. It's not really extreme hard to win every race 1st placed, you don't have to train for that.KI: They are dashing into your car and other KI constantly if they have the opportunity, faster then you in acceleration and sometimes just really dumb, in rare cases even gets bugged. KI can push you, but you can't really push KI. Sad thing, feels like they are on rails more or less. Only following the next point without thinking about the next action.##Spoilers ON##Modes: Checkpoint Race, Race with KO, Checkpoint hunting, Hunt the Helicopter, Checkpoint Pathfinding, Collect the dropped boxes, Capture the Flag, Return the Flag, Checkpoint area control, The best is just the simple checkpoint Races. ##Spoilers OFF##The ones without Checkpoints are only winable with LUCK because of the randomness of the KI. Hunt the helicopter is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ implemented. A helicopter flys round for round the same track with an highlighted area underneath. You CAN'T stay always under it because the acceleration of the helicopter is way faster then your car, no indication where it goes, really sharp corners or the KI just crashes you of the track... Same with flags, these reckless KI cars don't care for their points or play tactical they just follow the next point...  VERY FRUSTRATINGWould be more fun with more normal races in my oppinon. Maps:There are 4 bioms which have several Racing Tracks on them The Checkpoint Tracks are really enjoyable and would have potential in Multiplayer. Some are a bit too bumpy, which stops the flow of the game.Vehicle Park:As there are several Car tiers (Buggys, ""SUVs"", Pickups, Trucks, Monster Trucks) with each 3 Cars it's kinda diversified as you have to choose correct from map to map. In the end you get 3 Prototyp cars which are a little bit better in some points then the campaign cars. Vehichles are not from a brand or something, just cars. Damage Model/System:It's only a real thing for the start of the Campaign. Later it's more or less: if you hit a wall too fast your car ""explodes"", otherwise you are fine. There is no long time Damage Model which would even affect driving. Driving:Real arcade, you have nitro which refules over time (no actions or stunts required). There is no threshold for acceleration, only arrow keys. UI/Graphics:Map, Timer, Place, ""Radar"" (which is pretty usless). Would need a simple indication how fast you go...Graphics are more like 2010 or so. On ""high"" speeds your vehicle starts to visually shake, very wierd...			"

												If you came here from the original 1nsane (3D * 4WD * 56K), you're going to be sorely disappointed with this one. Far from the original benchmark offroad racer, In2ane is a Motorstorm clone with surprisingly high production values but just sub-par gameplay.Handling is floaty, the camera swing and shake is too artificial to let the game shine, and while the original game modes and classic wrap-around-maps are back in abundance, the vehicle physics are just too half-baked even compared to Motorstorm to really be engrossing. Targem put forth a good effort that shows a lot of pride in their work, I'll give them that, but the game just isn't satisfying to play.			"

												This is indeed a nice arcade game. If realistic physics are your thing then this is not your cup of tea, but if you just want to see a car drive fast and bounce, this just might be quite good for you. The only thing really bothering me is the cheating AI, its cars seem to be able to teleport nearer to a checkpoint at will. If you can't program an AI that can play a game this simple without cheats then perhaps you shouldn't be programming an AI.I any case I do recommend this one for any arcade driving fan.			"

												I unfortunately never had the chance to play the first 1nsane, which I hear was a fantastic experience, and from what I understand the multiplayer is next to nonexistent for this game.However.This is perhaps one of the most enjoyable racing games I've played.There's plenty to unlock in the way of cars and upgrades, and most of the ways to unlock new cars and gain points for cars requires a little effort, but every moment is enjoyable and worth it - by racing and completing objectives on mainly off-road courses against other AI vehicles who are very aggressive in achieving those goals.The world physics are set to the extreme - this means that your car will often not have more than one or two tires on the road for most of the time you are racing, and drifting on dirt and snow is commonplace. The emergency braking and the boost make it even more entertaining, and add in AI vehicles that are under the same influences... it makes for a crazy fun experience.There's plenty of various game modes to enjoy, from a more traditional off-road race to Pursuit of following a helicopter and staying under it to Greed, which is a point box drop collect-a-thon. All of them bring their own mayhem, and while often frustrating, it's also adrenaline-pumping and hilarious to see what happens as cars smash into one another and chunks of metal fly off.Your car can take damage, and you'll see the wear and tear. It doesn't actually impact how your vehicle handles however (which may be a pro or a con depending on your viewpoint), and unlike in the first 1nsane where you could apparently keep driving with a wheel or two missing, your car simply breaks if you lose one and just have to reset your car. Which has a dedicated key, and I've often abused it to give myself an edge in the CTF modes, where the flag actually has a physical impact on how your car handles and can cause it to flip, especially if you're in a smaller buggy or sprinter and not a massive truck.All of this, and everything looking good while blasting along at insane speeds. Seriously, this game has some great aesthetics - and it won't break your computer while pleasing your eyes.I'd highly recommend getting this game even on its own, and if you can get some friends to play it online with you, I can imagine there's plenty of laughs and yelling bloody murder at the screen to be had.

												Very dynamic, simple, good looking and fun arcade racing. It has everything it needs and executes it just right (exept for ""Pursuit"" mode, which is actual horror to play and I'd like to choke somebody who decided to put it in the game).			"

												This isn't much like the first game, but it's pretty awesome in a different way.  Graphics looks really great, AI drivers are good, maps and gameplay are very varied and never boring.  Split screen is good too.  All in all, top quality if you want a crazy fast paced arcade racer.  The only disapointment is the damage system from the first game is gone, no soft body physics, you're just broken or you're not.			"
