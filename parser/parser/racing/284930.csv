												Speed KIlls.  An abandon game by Holy Warp.  Store page is misleading.  Full controller support stated but not implemented.  This issue has been posted in the game's forum as far back as July.  No alternate view as most games in this genre offer.  Broken achievements.  Play Little Racers Street or Motor Rock.  See what polished mini racers look like and how the pride and self-respect of a developer can infuse a game with spirit and sparkle.			"

												While this game does have a lot going for it, and I am enjoying it for what it is, there are a lot of details that are lacking or completely absent that would prevent me from recommending this game to anyone that isn't madly craving isometric combat racing.The good:Multiple cars of 3 classes that can be upgraded and switched back and forth. Regret a purchase? Switch back to a previous car that is still fully upgraded and you knew how to win in. You can't sell any cars you own, but its nice to know you won't screw yourself mid-game with a bad choice.Circuits are replayable as many times as you'd like. Try again and again to beat one, or replay a circuit as a cash-cow until you've got your funding for an upgrade.This game does not use any resources from R&RR. It is the same game format and a similar concept, but there is nothing directly copied, so I can't see any takedown issues over this game.Music is good, but repetative. Graphics are good, and show speed well. Opponents are good at blocking you in while the playing field is evenly matched. The game concept is sound, and is exactly what you think it is... but...The iffy and bad:There is no map. There are signs before every turn that indicate the angle and direction, but without any way to see the full course, it is awkward trying to plan out the best path. Because the tracks are somewhat uniform, it takes a good bit of memorization to know when a turn is coming, and when is a good or bad time to use the turbo boost.There both is and isn't gamepad support: my x360 gamepad works in the actual game, but not in the menus. There is no indication anywhere in-game of what buttons do what, and there is no way to reconfigure the gamepad buttons in the settings menu. For the record:RT: accelerateLT: brake/reverseA: turboB: rear weaponX: front weaponY: respawn from off-trackYou will need to use the keyboard ENTER and ESC for any and all menus. There is no mouse-click to match to the ESC button, and several menus do not have a back function beyond ESC. This is annoying, but workable. A different controller might be more effective than mine, but this is what I have.Weapons do not adjust for terrain. This game has a lot of ramps, jumps, and drops as you drive around the course, and even though some front-firing weapons do track after opponents, they frequently crash into a change in the track's slope. Again, track memorization will help, but that takes time to learn and there is no map to give hints to your location. Since weapons do not automatically reload to full between races, this can burn through your money.Power-ups are plentiful, but they are always in the center of the track, and are frequently taken by the lead vehicle. If you're trailing, you won't often find them... if you're leading, you can keep hitting them every few seconds, and unless you make a bad turn, you will not likely see another car for the rest of the race. This is kinda game-breaking, as this type of game is the most fun when you're actively fighting against the other cars.You can upgrade a car's armor and weapon count a total of 5 times each. You can upgrade a car's top speed and acceleration as a single stat, 5 times each... each time you upgrade, it will either boost top speed or acceleration. Not both, and you can't choose which one. Its a set path.You CANNOT upgrade your vehicle's handling. Your car will always turn at the same rate, and as you're able to drive faster, mid-to-late game cornering means hugging the outside of a turn and using the wall to grind around the corners because you simply cannot make the turns. Letting off of the accelerator button does not make your car turn any faster. Tapping the brake won't make you slide around a corner, but it will slow you down enough to make a turn... but there's not really a point to that, since grinding around the outer edge doesn't damage your car, and doesn't really slow you down enough to matter.You will spin badly in mid-air if you angle off of a jump wrong, and you will get turned around from collisions. Your car will roll forward off of some ramps, and there is no way to correct this, which will randomly slow you down on landings. While reverse does work, turning while backing up is VERY slow, and this cannot be improved. If you face the wrong way for more than a few seconds, the game will auto re-spawn your vehicle facing the right way in the center of the track... it will sometimes do this while you're in the middle of a turn if you aren't facing the correct way, and has happened to me twice, so far.The conclusion:The opponents are not very challenging once you've upgraded your cars a bit... get ahead of them, and keep your car in the middle of the track whenever possible, and any race is yours. The unmapped tracks, weird landings from the many jumps, and lack of handling are far more of a threat than any of the other cars. Without being able to play against other opponents (at this time), or increase the opponent AI difficulty (I have not fully beaten the game, that may be an option after 1 completion, but I don't see anything for now), this is not a very challenging game.If you're absolutely craving this kind of game, then get it, but be aware of what you're purchasing.

												I was looking forward to this game as I love isometric racers and there's not a whole lot of them to choose from. But sadly, while this game has potential, it's way too buggy and unfinished to recommend. I've had a couple of crashes, freezes and the game minimizing the window for no apparent reason. Achievements don't work. Well, that's a lie. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Sometimes achievements pop up an hour after you should have got them. The handling of the cars can be extremely wonky. The controls are fine, it's the physics engine which will sometimes ragdoll your car in all different directions that kills it. You can hit a jump dead on and it will fling your car to the right or to the left. You can come to a complete stop because your car gets stuck in a wall. The AI might hit you from behind and your car will ragdoll 180 and respawn you on the track, killing your speed. Sometimes the game will respawn you even when you're going the right way because it thinks you're going the wrong way. The Angkor tournament, race 5 division A, has a jump with a speed boost in front of it. Once you hit the jump it flings you over the wall and you respawn. Every single time. You could use it to grind for the ""fly out of the track 100 times"" achievement. That's if achievements worked. It's all kinds of bad. Luckily, the game is not that hard. I've been able to win 4 out of the 6 tournaments even though the game does it's best to kill your progress with it's insane handling. The customization is nice though. 7 cars which you can upgrade either speed, armor or weapons. You'll have to replay some of the tournaments to earn enough money to progress, but that's fairly common in these kind of games. Devs promised to patch the game and fix achievements in June 2014. It's now December and there's been no word from them since, so don't expect these issues to be fixed. Also, there's no controller support in menus even though the store page claims full controller support. I cannot recommend this game due to the unfinished state and the broken handling. Pick up Death Rally instead.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Speed KillsDeveloper:  Holy Warp & Black Wing FoundationPublisher:  KISS ltdGenre:  Top-down RacerGeneral ImpressionA promising racing game that almost delivers if it was not plagued by constant AI quirks and irritating controls. This is definitely a game that is best played on a controller and not by mouse and keyboard. The lack of any multiplayer mode, leaves us with a slightly too easy single player experience. It features plenty of track and car diversity so it never felt  boring. Other than that we have a classic style gameplay that revolves around constantly upgrading your car to overcome the rivals on the track.Strong Points+ Beautiful 3D graphics.+ Track and racing car diversity.+ Pleasant soundtrack.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Controls are not as responsive as I’d hoped.- AI problems make the game seem too easy at times.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

												Do you remember good ol' Rock'n'Roll Racing? With all it's great cartoonish graphics, sensitive and good controls, AWESOME music and competitive gameplay? Me too. This game brings... NOTHING of it. The controls are horrible, the game mechanics are buggy. (I had a moment in the game where I had to jump the trampoline to continue the race. It took me 5 tries! Ok, you may say I'm a noob. But. The opponents had to do the same! Can you imagine? 3 cars respawning 5 times in attempt to make the jump!!! ) The graphics are nice, The characters are new, ok. Everything else is ""meh"", I'd rather stick to Death Rally remake avaliable on Steam. It feels better.TL:DR; Feel nostalgic? Wait for a bundle.			"

												oh yeah another isometric racer.  i cant recommend this one though.things that annoy me:*i raced a dozen tracks and they all looked exactly the same. gotta put a little effort in to keep people interested.*you can exit the post-race screen by hitting a button on the controller, but that same button stubbornly refuses to start the next race even though it is supposed to work. *in every race i played, every single powerup was located directly in the middle of the track. nes classic r.c. pro-am is almost 30 years old now, but even back then they knew enough to place the items on different areas of the track. devs manage to suck a lot of fun out of the game when all i have to do is just stay in the middle of the track and i know i will collect literally every powerup they've placed on the track.i own at least a dozen games like this one. they are mostly bad, and unfortunately this one is no exception. i wont be playing again any time soon.

												This game is really fun. I'm really enjoying it so far.However, there are lots of room for improvement: First of all, this game NEEDS a multiplayer mode. I hope the developers will include this feature in the near future.While the races are fun and the gameplay is perfect, the menus are awful to say the least. The fact that you can play the game in your controller, but need to go to your keyboard just so you can select options in the menu is annoying. There's also no way to configure the controller layout for the game.Overall, the game is worth the money. As I said before, it's really fun once you start playing. I just hope that the developers will work to improve some of its flaws (Please fix the menus!!!!)			"

												Still comparing to Rock´n Roll Racing? It had a worth sucessor with Death Rally. Speed Kills feels like a very cheap, unfinished game compared to DR. I wanted to like it, but after a few minutes I only want to play my Death Rally, that even on Android systems performs great.Another downside of SK is that it has partial xbox gamepad support, and that is very irritating... If you REALLY like this style and already finished DR, maybe it is ok if you pick it on sale or in a bundle.			"

												Disgusting game. It is much more frustrating than fun. Any car that slightly touches you will turn you over or slow you to the end of the rankings. The controls are messed up too. Cars don't attack each other. They only attack you... It's more like a puzzle game, reallyAt every start of the match you have to keep trying to use that first nitro without being slowed to death by the other cars, so you have to restart the match again and again and again and again.

												stay away from this game. i'm serious. it's horrible.for starters  there are a few things in general you should know:1. the game was abandoned by the devs quite a while back so nothing is ever going to be fixed.2. i didn't test it myself but people say controller support is really bad.3. about half the achievements are broken and cannot be obtained.so much for that. now about the game itself.- you are stuck in this horrible iso view and can't change the view mode. most of the time you have no idea where the heck you are actually going when you race around with full speed. - game physics are really, really bad. very often your car turns and flips in midair for no reason. or you scratch the wall of a perfectly rounded 90° turn and suddenly you hit a dead pixel, stopping your car from 200 kph to 0 in an instant and doing a 180° turn as well.- all powerups are placed just in the middle of the track allowing you to pick them all up and use them without leaving anything to the players behind you. so you should be able to stay on 1st place from start to finish. right?- wrong! the rubberband AI cheats all the time. you own the best car, you have bought all the upgrades, you use nitro all the time. but suddenly someone catches up to you, casually drives by and heads off into the sunset leaving you way behind. how can he possibly go faster than you? where did he get all the nitro after you picked the road clean of powerups for miles? bullsh!t!- the tracks are as boring as they can get. there are 45° turns, there are 90° turns, there are straights and there are ramps for jumping. that's all! it's like a five-year-old put together these tracks with lego!most of the time you are not really playing this game but fighting the game itself and dealing with horrible controls, horrible iso view and horrible car handling.stay away from this piece of sh!t.

Basic InformationTitle: Speed KillsGenre: Action, Indie, RacingDeveloper: Holy Warp ,	Black Wing Foundation Publisher: Holy Warp, KISS ltd	Release Date: 16 May, 2014Basic OverviewThis is a very fun racing game that defiantly can cure the boredom in your life for a hour or two if you have it. It's graphics don't really suit the futuristic theme to the game since the game is set in the future. There isn't really anything really advanced in the environment that you race in. There is quite a balance of bad and good things about this game, so let's get started with the usual categories.Game PlaySo let's start off by talking about the game play of this game. It's simply a futuristic racing game with guns on your cars. There is quite a balance of good and bad things here. First off let's talk about the some of the good points about this game.  You'll be glad to know that (well for me anyways) this game has a high replay value. I'm not really sure what kept me going back to play this game, since I had a few short breaks, but I just did. It felt really satisfying to complete a race in first place and grab some money at the end to upgrade your car. It's also a very competitive game even though you are racing against bots. I would really like to see this game take thongs forward and possibly add a Online-Multiplayer mode to it for even more fun and replay value. Like I said in the overview, it seems to be really good at curing your boredom when you are playing it. I think that it's the satisfaction of shooting while you drive and winning first place in the race. Now for some bad things about this game that I don't really want to talk about but I will go through them none the less. The game play can be a bit frustrating at times, because sometimes the collisions of the cars can be very unforgiving. Starting a jump will immediately cancel out any nitro that you're using and since there are multiple jumps throughout each map this makes it difficult to take full advantage of your boost. Sometimes jumps can make you do a U turn if you don't land near enough straight, this can ultimately really mess up a race since you have to turn around and continue racing like nothing ever happened. I found that some of the upgrades where a little bit game breaking, for example if you upgrade your rig then use your boost at the start of the race then you can gain the lead straight off. You can then take very single power up that you can so that the cars behind you don't get any. However, this can also work the other way around. You could be last or near last and you can't pick up any power ups and really you're only chance of getting a power up is to restart. Another unfortunate thing about this game is that sometimes you have to grind for cash to even stand a fighting chance in the later levels. This can really drain the games replay ability and fun as no one wants to grind on a game for money to stand a chance to win. One last bad thing about this game is that there is no map to show you the track you are on. This means you have to memorize the track in order to get the full advantage of the track that you are on. The game slightly helps you, by having a arrow and a number to tell you how sharp the turn is and in which direction you are turning in. This kind of helps you but then again a map in the corner of the screen would've been a lot easier.Score (Out Of 10): 6 - Would like to see Online-Multiplayer, add a mini map in the top left or right of the screen, fix the spawn rate of the power ups, or increase the length of the track so you have a chance to get a power up if you're behind everyone else.Graphics/art styleThe graphics for me feel okay. They don't really seem to fit in with the kind of futuristic style that this game takes on with it. Would like to see some futuristic like technology around the environment  as I drive around the tracks. Maybe even some futuristic technology for your cars that make you go on the side of the wall or something. For me this game doesn't feel futuristic enough with the whole premise of it being in the distant future.Score (Out Of 10): 7 - Would like to see some more futuristic technology in the environment and/or for the cars.Music & SoundsThe music for this game fits in nicely with the futuristic and racing style that this game has to offer, although can get a bit repetitive. The sounds are just generic, nothing much to really talk about with this category.Score (Out Of 10): 8 - Music can get repetitive after a while, and the sounds are just genericConclusionAlthough this game has a few flaws that let it down, I still recommend this game to racing fans. There is some really high replay value in this game, with a nice variety of cars and upgrades that can help you though the game. Although sometimes you may find that you have to grind for money to stand a fighting chance in some of the races, although winning a race in first place is really satisfying.For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.

												Fun, but abandoned game. A shame. Do NOT pay ANY money for this.Usually I'm the first to defend a developer who's not making regular updates on things, but in cases such as this? The developer doesn't react to inquiries or anything. There are quite some issues and bugs that need attention...for over 2 years now. Due to this I will avoid saying anything more about the game itself. Next thing I'm gonna is try to contact the publisher, they usually have an open ear. If there's no substantial update in 2017, don't bother looking any further into this...unless you'd like to try make some pressure on the dev or something.			"

It does not have full controller support, not even partial and could have been a fun little racer if the controls weren't so terrible.

												Requires more luck than skill. Enemy cars actively sabotage the player by bumping the rear and causing a spinout, effectively preventing the player from winning the race. As an example, even when nothing goes wrong in terms of having your car impeded, the average difference between 1st and 2nd is 2 seconds at the most. Therefore, the 5 seconds you'll be out of comission while the car spins out means you might as well accept last place.Further in regard to driving balance, all the power ups are random and the delay between power ups cause only the person in 1st and maybe 4th place to get them and they typically are placed in the middle of the road. The other drivers have no real chance at winning once those positions are established. The times I won a race was entirely due to spamming my Nitros to get into 1st place position and lucking my way through speed boost power ups.The vehicles look good, the game has some decent art presentation and okay music. The problem is the game is awful.			"

												Let me ask your questions.Does it look good? - Yes, if you're not looking for high graphic gamesIs it enjoyable? - If you like racing and destroying other cars with power-ups, yesDoes the rivals only shot you? - Nope. They also shoot each other.How much fun is it? - Well, it's pretty fun but it's hard to keep the first position and you'll get a little nervousDoes it work on old systems? - Yes. I have no problems playing it on a GeForce 8600GTS from 2007Is it worth the price? - Not really. I would get it for 5$. But for 10$ it's a little too expensive.Speed Kills is a well made racer-shooting game. I'm enjoying it. It's challenging and fun if you don't mind losing sometimes because the AI is made at a high difficulty. There are car classes and planets to race on. With every championship won you move onto the new planet and you can buy a new car to keep up with the competition.People don't find this game as good as today's games but hey - games are made to entertain us. Make us waste time having fun. And this game is a classic top-down racing style you must try (if you got it for free from indiegala it's much better) "

												Awful. Simply awful. Terrible collision detection, crap level design, no learning curve, crap ai in general - basically, if you're in the lead, you get to collect all the power ups and stay in the lead. The power ups will reappear, but you'd be too far back to actually have them be any help. The game LOOKS good, but exectures terribly. Not to mention the half-♥♥♥♥♥ menu that seems to only be partly controller enabled.  High hopes dashed. Stick with ANYTHING else.			"

												Greetings, I do not want my money back, I just want this review to stay at game's store page forever as a ""don't buy"" warning to all who are at same situation as mine.I have lost my legs because of a car accident. That's why, I can play games with only controller because reaching mouse and keyboard is a true pain for me. All I can do this is laying at my couch and playing games at my tv...Today I installed your game (which says it has 100% controller support) and I realized controller is not supported and %100 controller support was a lie. You can only do right, left, top, bottom but no button is working in the game. After starting the game, you cannot even quit because no buttons are working. It took me half hour to reach my keyboard and mouse to close the game. I cannot imagine why such a game developer or sales manager or whoever responsible for the game, would want to do this to a crippled person. Shame on you. I wish all of you will experience the same situation to understand me trully.Regards,			"

												Definetly not worth it's pricetag.Pros:-I honestly can't find any good thing about the game.Cons:-No multiplayer support of any kind.-Dull and repetitive races, with terrible racetrack models.-Outlandish 3D models, which makes you wonder why if this is a 31st century battle racing it has way less polygons than Super Mario 64.-Terrible sound effects, which bug out and cause you to have an ear check and have to buy new headphones becuase the terrible and annoying sound effects are repeated so frecuently that they overlap, causing the sound volume to go up, and the quality to go down.-No music.-It's one of those arcade games that you used to play for a few coins, except that here you have it forever and poorly optimized.TL;DR: It's a bad Idea which was poorly executed.

												Very dissapointing no wonder it's always on sale, the original store page sold it for me, first time playing and i instantly got the feeling of micromachines. now it says ""full controller support"" this is a borderline lie as most of the menus you have to use the keyboard and mouse, also its a pain after every race you have to go to the garage again and rebuy your ammo, also it doesn't even give you a chance to get up to speed it's instantly 1 lap and you have the slowest car even no matter how much you upgrade it your still going to come in 8th place.Another issue is the graphics i have an Nvidia 630 2gb graphics and yet the screen cant seem to keep up as its trying to advertise other games on its billboards.Nice artwork .... but not what it seems when you see the micromachine track and no directions of which way your supposed to be going lol			"

												This game suck so hard......no local or online multiplayer. Controller doesn't work on menus. Can't even beat first race because even though car is level 2 upgrades they still are way faster than you and since they are in front of you they get all the upgrades so they keep gettin nitro and boosting ahead while you're stuck there with your ♥♥♥♥ in your hands. Even their base speed is just strictly more than yours. And the rockets and mines  suck and aren't useful or effective. I didn't want o keep grinding the first race like the game wants you to. How can you suck so much to screw up in designing the first race of the game?! 1/10.			"

												The problem with this is that the race is basically over once you're first around the first corner (aka spamming all your nitros at the start), if by any chance you're not first by then don't expect to come first by the end of the race. The only useful upgrade stat in-game is speed, armor and weapons are practically useless since the best way to win is to avoid combat alltogether. Also I've hit invisible walls in corners quite a few times which is a total buzzkill.			"

Unfortunately this game lacks the charm of its predecessor.  Bare bone features, lack of memorable characters, and mundane, and repetitive, music result in a rather mediocre experience. 6.5 / 10			"

												Not quite a worthy successor to Racing Destruction Set (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3R-_flF4Y) this game could be a lot of fun in the same toybox vein, but the controller support is significantly broken and despite the turns being limited to 90 and 45-degree options, keyboard controls will frequently have you bouncing off the track and into a black void outside the boundaries of the map, waiting many precious seconds for your car's explosion animation to complete and for you to be dropped back onto the track.  That, coupled with the developers' near-total absence in the forums from the release date onward except to quickly respond that features or support will not be implemented, makes for a significant disappointment.  This could've been a heck of a lot of fun, but as it is, it feels like something that fell victim to the 90-90 rule of software development and the devs gave up after the first 90%.			"

												Glad I bought this game on sale for $2.50, because it's not worth $10.  First of all, there isn't full controller support as you can't navigate through the menus or pause a race with the controller (with either the Logitech F310 or the XBox One). Secondly, the campaign is too short for the full price and there's grinding to be done on just the first circuit. Watch my full review here:

												As I round the final bend at speed, my hovercraft's tyres screeching, oh hang on, that's probably just a bug, I rocket towards the finish line and give a disappointed ""meh, is this all there is to this game?""This game is trying to be Rock N Roll Racing, without the sound track, without the variation in vehicles, without much effort. It's bizarre how the game locks you into your lane, almost doing away with the need for steering. I say almost because for the most part you can just let your car smack into the rounded corners and allow your car grind along the barrier. Some barriers will look as smooth as the rest, however will send you careening back in the opposite direction.The characters you meet (the other racers) tend to have no personality in their driving, and are strangely supportive of you between races on the loading screen, encouraging you to do better or congratulating you on a job well done. With the exception of the female-esque final baddie, who just spouts passive-agressive missives at you. Why does this robot have boobs and an accusing face anyway? Does it help her race?There are a lot of games that do a lot better than this. Sure it's pretty, sure it passes the time okay, and sure it's cheap; but you get what you pay for.Buy it or don't.			"

												- It may say it has full controller support, but it does not. You can't navigate the menus with one and can not remap anything. Playing racing games on a keyboard isn't great.- The tracks are all the same with no visual difference. There is nothing in the way of graphical options beyond resolution.- The powerups are all in the middle of the track with little variation leaving nothing for anyone but the CPU in first. Once you're in last, you're not getting out. All powerups will be gone as you pass and the AI isn't particularly forgiving. You have to grind the first tournament over and over to get any cash.- Bad audio. The sound effects make everything feel like a toy, or (Like when you end a race) are completely missing. You go from crossing the finish line to at a menu with no effect whatsoever.- Crashes often.- Basically abandoned. This game needs a major patch or a complete overhaul. Look at the news. There's no updates from the dev and it's been a very long time. I think it's DOA.Save your money.			"

												It is a fun little racing game to play though the controller support for it in game is decent, definitely unsupported in the menu selection. My biggest peeve with this game though is the fact of how it feels overall incompleted and you not only have to deal with the AI to win the races but so many glitches! For example when you reset your vehicle anywhere near someone you get launched off the screen. Goodluck catching back up after that since it takes forever to reset....			"

												This is literally one of the worst games I ever played.Controller support is partial at best, making it not only impossible to use menus but hasn't even mapped weapons making it useless for play. The A.I. seems to be very hard, wich is something people could want, but also seems to conspire against the player. But all that could be forgiven, if after you inevitably lost the race the game wouldn't assault you with plain smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry. I get that this wants to be Mad Max like Machismo but this is an 16 year old edgelords idea of banter.I was really happy to play this, since I loved isometric racing games when I was young but this is little more than a string of frustrations broken up by the occasional insult and if there was any way to delete games from ones library I would.

												The game is a whole mess of bugs.Playing with keyboard is totally unpleasent and unintuitive. Playing with controller requires you to use keyboard anyway for the menù buttons selection since controller does not work there. And the gaming experience is cluncky as well.- The gui is pretty ugly.- The command response is slow.- The graphic is meah.- The graphic customization not really present.- The weapons are not really responsive- The circuit is hard to predict and you must constantly watch for signs to guess where the next curve is.- The game is clearly unfinished. - The game worths 0,01€.+ The overall pack can be fun if you are the ""i don't care about the well-crafting and the usability and the atmosphere i just want to play even if i need to rewire my brain to play this unintuitive game with poor enjoyable elements"" kind of guy.

												I've received this game for free from Indiegala store.This game takes much from old Death Really game, racing+weapons. I enjoyed this game, it keeps adrenaline really high. Graphic is nice, there are three groups of vehicles. Ohh this game runs under Windows XP, got few crashes, but generally it run smooth. Unfortunately there are also problems, first of, my enjoyment last two evenings, too short IMHO. Secondly creators not only took good things out of Death Really but also those problematic as well. Taking the lead is difficult, but once you are there for 99,99% race is won, and it's not about AI, it's about boosts that leader collects, there could be some tweaks added here, like some boosts slowing the leader, or random timing, or negative boosts. And now the ugliest part which you already see before buy. Such games usually have the most fun when you are with friends, but this game offers nothing, no multiplayer, no local, no split-screen, nothing. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the game, but the content here is not worth 10 Euros. Still I saw this game really cheap on bundles, and on large sales I can recommend this game with all my heart.			"
