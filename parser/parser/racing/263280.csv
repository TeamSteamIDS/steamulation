												Update 25.03.15Positive:+ Terrain deformation+ Tire pressure simulation+ Realistic water behaviour+ Driving physics in general+ Maps are pretty big, and full of challenging terrain+ You can mow down trees ^_^+ Multiplayer+ Vehicles of all sizes, ranging from the small UAZ (Jeep) to the monstrous 8x8 Maz.+ Winching is fun and very useful. You can attach it to both other vehicles and trees.+ Attaching a crane to your truck, to pick up lumber, move rocks out of the way and sometimes to help push the truck up.+ The game is very well optimized.+ Trucks take damage, and consume fuel. You can install a utility addon for mobile repairs, or a fuel cistern for re-fueling in the field.+ Patch released on 27/10 -14 added wheel support.+ Patch released on 27/10 -14 added analogue controller input.+ Patch implemented individual saves for all maps. Big plus in my book.Negative:- The camera could be much better. With the tallest addons it can be a real challenge to see ahead.- Maps could be more varied. It's mostly the same mix of grass, trees, mud and water.- The only official objective is to haul lumber. More variety would be welcome.- Lack of proper manual shifting.- Draw distance should be customizable.With all that said... As a VIP backer on the kickstarter campaign, and having had access to the beta since May 9, I can safely recommend this game to anyone with an interest in off-roading. If you've tried the tech demo, you know what to expect. Just think bigger; more trucks, more functionality and much bigger maps. All in all, even in beta, this is perhaps the most fun I have had in a realistic off-road game so far. Try the tech demo first; if you like it - there's a safe bet that you will enjoy the full game.The devs seem committed to continuing to improve the game after launch, both with free updates and dlc packs later on.Check out this link for planned changes to the game: http://www.oovee.co.uk/forum/topic/9056-dev250814-information-on-updates-and-more/ "

												THERE IS A TECH DEMO AVAILABLE FOR FREE, GET IT HERE; http://www.spintires.com/#!/demo . I highly recommend that you download and try it before purchasing, purely because you may find that you don't get on with the game for one reason or another. The download file is only about 100 Mb, so there's really no excuse not to try it. That said, the tech demo is quite different from the actual release. However, if you like the concept of the demo enough to pay for the release, then, in all probability, you won't be dissapointed.I think that Spintires could be accurately described as quite a devisive game, that is to say that you'll probably either really like it, or find it the most mind numbing tedium you've ever experienced in gaming. It's like Marmite, you'll either love it, or you'll hate it. Personally, I love it. The games that I tend to enjoy most are those that afford you a great deal of freedom to choose what you want to do and how you want to do it. in short, I love sandbox games. I think that Spintires could be described as a sandbox, admittedly all you can do is drive around in some mud, but you're free to choose the vehicle you want to use, the modifications for that vehicle, the direction you drive said vehicle in, create challenges for yourself and so on. If, like me, you're into your sandbox games then I highly recommend that you try it. I find it a great game to finish an evening's gaming with. It helps to wind me down from explosions, guns, violence and high levels of intensity commonly found in games (at least the games I play) these days. Put your favourite album on, play half an hour of this game and you should be pretty chilled out. In terms of actual content, there are seven different vehicles, ranging from a little jeep, to a massive eight-wheeled leviathan of a machine, each with customisable features, such as trailers and tyres, and five different maps. Each map is about 1 Km squared. This may not sound like an awful lot of space to play with, especially if you're into your sandbox games, but the nature of the landscape is such that the challenge is more or less constant and you're not often moving with a great deal of speed. For example, if you make a journey across one of the more challenging maps with a trailer full of the medium sized logs, without any hitches, then it'll probably take you about fifteen to twenty minutes. I have never felt like I wanted bigger maps. That said, dont expect much aesthetic variety between maps, they all look very similar, broadly speaking. However, as I have said, some maps are certainly harder to navigate than others. In terms of what there is to do, it really depends on how inventive and creative you are as a gamer. If you like to stick to the formal objectives of a game, that is, what the game is explicitly telling you to do, then you'll be sorely dissapointed. The objective on each of the five maps is the same, unlock all of the cloaked areas, discover and unlock all of the vehicles present on the map, discover and unlock all the garages on the map, and deliver timber from the lumber mill to the objective. That's it in terms of formal missions. That said, getting your first load of lumber to the mill is incredibly satisfying. On par with landing on the moon for the first time in Kerbal Space Programe (KSP players will know what I'm talking about). If you're more creative and create your own challenges then you'll get a lot more mileage out of this game, for example, driving across one of the maps without using all wheel drive in the UAZ. If you're an experienced sandbox gamer then you'll get far more mileage (literally) out of this game. I have to put in a word for the aesthetic appeal of this game. In my opinion, Spintires is one of the most beautiful games I have in my library, although I'm aware that there are others who hold the contrary position (beauty is in the eye of the beholder, after all). The graphics are quite unique, they have an almost tilt-shift kind of thing going on (if you don't know what that is, google it, I guarantee you'll like what you see, no, it's not boobs). They're almost kind of stylised. The look of the vehicles and the environment do an incredible job of creating this wonderful Russian ambience.The physics, on the whole (I'm looking at you, magical jumping rocks) are stellar. The ground deformation (in most cases) is reliable and beautiful to look at. I can safely say that I am not aware of any other game that has done it as well as Spintires has. The water is also amazing. It looks gorgeous driving through it, having it splash around your truck, rather than being this inert entity in the game world. The suspension on all the vehicles is awesome, as is the tyre deformation. It legitimately looks like your vehicle is driving over what it is supposed to be driving over (or through, on some particularly bad roads you'd be hard pressed to say that you were actually driving on the road). Trees shake as you bump into them, flex as you anchor you winch to them and pull, saplings bend and snap as you drive over them. If you like physics games, or games that do physics well, and can justify buying a game on those grounds then I'd recommend picking this up. If you like BeamNG Drive or Next Car Game for their physics, then you'll like Spintires (but not because of the soft body physics, I hasten to add. The soft body physics are perhaps the only aspect of the physics in Spintires which may be considered to be deficient).  On top of this the game runs (in my experience) very well indeed. I'm not particularly well versed in performance and optimisation, so I cant say much here, but what I can say is that this game runs considerbaly better than you might think. I do all my gaming on my Lenovo Z585 Ideapad, so I'm running it on an AMD Radeon 7660G + 76070M dual graphics card, 8GB of RAM, and a quad-core processor, running on Windows 8. It's a less than ideal gaming setup, but it's the best that I can justifiably afford. I can run Spintires with everything at maximum and get a (fairly) solid 30 frames per second, often higher. So for those of you like me out there with low-powered rigs, then spintires is probably a game you can enjoy in all it's glory. Again, if you're having reservations based upon doubts about how well it'll perform, get the tech demo (link at top of review, it's free). Most of what I've said so far has been positive, however, there are a couple of negatives. Don't expect frequent updates. Even the updates that there have been really have not changed much. This is probably down to Oovee being such a small studio. Also (I can't verify this, since I've not played the multiplayer), apparently you can't save your progress in multiplayer, once you quit the game, all the work and cool stuff you are your friends pulled off is gone. On the subject of saving, there are no quicksaves. You can't roll up to a river and quicksave just in case you don't make it across. It's do or die. For some this may be incredibly frustrating. For me, however, I tend to find that the absense of a quicksave feature forces me to play much more carefully and methodically. It gives real weight to challenges, and provides a genuine sense of achivement when you overcome an obstacle. I can see why people may not like this, but personally, it's a feature who's ommission I am pleased with. So overall, I'd say Spintires is a great, unique, solid game. But get the tech demo and decide for yourself. Oh, a word of warning, if you buy Spintires because you liked the tech demo and expect lots of new features and a good deal more 'game' then you're going to be dissapointed. If on the other hand you're infatuated with the tech demo and want some more trucks and maps to play with then you'll be delighted.TL;DR, Get the tech demo and decide for yourself (link at top of review). Thanks for reading, hope this helped :).			"

												First things first: never play this game in single player, its like having only 1/4 of the fun. One of the best games i heve played in my life.The reasoning for this is that this game looks like another dull singleplayer simulator ALTHOUGH it isnt!The goal is very simple, get logs from one side of the map (lumbercamp) to the other side('s) of the map (sawmill).But achieving this goal is not as easy as it seems.Yesterday before i started a Hardcore map with 4 friends we discussed around 15 min what our plan of approach was for a specific map.We thought we had it all figured out... we were wrong.But we had the uttermost fun in being wrong while our trucks broke down, fell down, did a roll over, got stuck, or drowned.Underestimate this game while you buy it. and recieve a big fat middle finger in your face while playing and having stomach ache's of the laughing.Do you recommend this game? HELL YES			"

												Being a VIP Backer of this game when it was started on kickstarter I got to watch this game develop from the ground up and can happily say that the progress in which it has come from the tech demo is awesome. Awesome vehicles, a solid assortment of vehicles with awesome add-ons to change up on the trucks to suit any situation whether it be needed for hauling, repairing, fueling or just plain Sunday cruising. Awesome terrain with water crossings, narrow timber bridges, hill climbs, dirt roads, muddy roads, tarmac roads or why not make your own road. It can be a logistical nightmare whilst doing long hauls on your own whilst having to consider damaging your vehicle, low fuel and just plain getting lost but with multiplayer being implemented it is sure to be the perfect package.  If you are like me and love driving, driving games or even off-roading in real life then this is the game for you. You will not find a better off roader. Highly recommended!

												Spintires is an offroad driving game where you get behind the wheel of a number of Russian vehicles and drive them through all the mud you could possibly hope for. Using only your map and compass you have to navigate the rugged terrain in order to complete objectives such as collecting and delivering lumber.+Great graphics+Quite a few different trucks, each with customisation options and they are all quite different to each other, in appearance and performance+Amazing mud physics, the deformation caused by driving through mud looks realistic and is excellent+Several maps, all of them are quite different to each other and the vehicles available vary between each one+The winch system is great and the power of it feels quite realistic+Multiplayer, particularly with friends, is a lot of fun+Driving controls are good, as are the crane controls (used for putting lumber in your trailer)+You have to discover the different parts of the map so even if you don't want to do the main objective there is a lot to do on each map+They did a very good job in making it difficult to judge water depth+/-The majority of the gameplay comes from getting yourself out of the mud, personally I think it's fun but it might put some people off-The camera controls and the camera itself are awful. The controls are very sensitive, when you zoom out it automatically zooms in making it very hard to see when using big trucks, it has a very strange centre, sometimes it pans by itself, you can only move it on the x-axis, it has awkward angles and it's difficult to get it at the angle you want-The devs still haven't added a first person camera which was promised very early on after its launch-The relationship between the dev and the community isn't great (see forums)-Infrequent updates despite being promised regular large content updates-For what there is (i.e. the number of maps and trucks) it isn't worth the £19.99 price tag-There's not much difference between the demo and the full game-It feels very unfinishedVerdict: 6It's a fun offroad driving game but it has too many issues for me to recommend it at full price, grab it on sale and play it with friends.El K.

												I love this game. The only reason I haven't played more of it to date is the same reason I'm giving it a thumbs down. It shouldn't have left Early Access.When I started playing it (March '15) it was already out of it and therefore supposedly a full release. I dipped my toes in every map and made some progress here and there, until one day they released an update and I found out my 20-something hours worth of advances had been wiped out with it. Looking around in the forums, it soon became apparent that it wasn't just me nor was this the first time it happened. In fact it happened with every single update done before. Others had lost much more time than I did.This would be excusable were the game in alpha/beta stage or even still Early Access and things were getting ironed out. Or if it was a 'rogue-like' or 'casual' game. Instead, this is the Dark Souls of truck driving games (set in some kind of deserted Russian Woodstock) and saving your progress is not something to dream about but a fundamental feature that is already there and works. Well, until they do another update. To be clear, I'm speaking of the single player aspect of the game only, as multiplayer has no saving options to date.Irked out, I forgot about it for some time, and came back a while later. This time I didn't split my attention on several maps, aware of the risk it would all go down the drain at any point. Soon enough came another update, and down the drain those extra few hours did go. In the wake of complaints in the forums, I remember reading an announcement by Oovee stating they would be having a meeting with the developer (I paraphrase) and would 'explain to him how important maintaining the saved game progress across updates seemed to be to the players'. Which to me is nothing short of fascinating. That such a basic and obvious priority needs to be told to a developer. Over a future meeting, no less.Today, about half a year later, came another update and, unsurprisingly, another wipe. Wonder how that meeting went.If you're on the fence and somehow stumble upon this, consider it a heads up that shouldn't get you out of the fence anyway, because I actually think the game is great, and it is perfectly playable as long as you don't wait too long to pick up where you left. The longer you wait, the higher the chance you'll have to start from scratch. I'll update the direction my two cents are spinning if I ever become aware of this issue getting resolved. As it stands, Spintires suffers from a lack of respect for its players' time.			"

												Spintires is a game about driving a truck across the countryside extremely slowly. Your truck is very heavy and the ground is very soft, almost constantly sucking your wheels downwards into its boggy brown mess, threatening to immobilise you in its wet earthy clutches.This isn't the sort of off-road simulator that's accompanied by an electric guitar riff and a cool man doing a wheely over a bush. No, it's slow and thoughtful off-roading. Progress is measured in feet per minute rather than miles per hour. This is hard work.The real star of the game is the mud. It is, without a doubt, the best virtual sludge in games. The way your tires dig into it, and the way it deforms realistically as you move through it, is really impressive. The heavier your vehicle is, the more it sinks into it, and the more likely you are to get stuck. Clumps gather on your wheels as you drive, and some areas are so caked in the stuff that you'll be forced to find another route. It's a game of feet, not miles—of dragging your bouncy flatbed through just one more exhausting mire of mud and rocks to reach the safety of a garage or refueling station.But you will get stuck, eventually, and that's where vehicle-switching comes into play. There are simple objectives, like picking up and delivering lumber, but it's the journey itself where the real challenge lies, and you'll need some help to heave your oversized load across the uncompromising landscape. After accidentally burying my lumber truck in a thick slurry, I pulled the map up with F1, switched to a nearby truck with a winch and yanked myself out. You can jump freely between vehicles on your own if you're playing solo, or team up with up to three other people in multiplayer.Your garage is filled with an array of vehicles to plough through the mud in, including nimble jeeps that are good for scouting the area ahead. They can cut through forests and wave between trees, allowing them to uncover the 'fog of war' that initially obscures the map and reveal wider roads and trails for your big haulers to squeeze through. There are trucks with articulated trailers, and big chunky ones that look like they've been rusting in the Chernobyl exclusion zone for the last thirty years. The muted colour palette, bleak overcast skies, and ageing Soviet machinery remind me of the STALKER games—as does the feeling of being constantly at war with your environment.As you chew through the mud, the vehicles feel genuinely heavy and unwieldy. The physics are excellent, creating a nice distinction between the big rigs and the smaller trucks. You'll hear your engine heave and groan as you tackle a steep incline or muddy patch, its exhausts belching black smoke as it struggles to escape the sticky gunk. They all feel like real machines, with trailers that bounce and rattle as you trundle over uneven ground. Rocks are kicked into the air by your tires, saplings bend when you rumble over them, and water froths as you ford rivers and carve through puddles.You can choose between casual and hardcore mode, although 'casual' will be hardcore enough for most people. Fuel consumption is increased in hardcore, and routes you chart on the map won't be displayed as a guide on the road as you drive. One of the most mystifying omissions is the lack of any kind of cockpit or in-car view. You're stuck with a weird over-the-shoulder (trucks don't have shoulders, but you know what I mean) view that's more Resident Evil 4 than truck simulator. You can move the camera around with the mouse, but in larger rigs your view is often obscured, making getting across narrow bridges and through tight trails a nightmare.But here's my problem with Spintires. As amazing as the physics and deformable mud are, that's really all the game has going for it. Its scope is incredibly limited, to the point where it feels like an Early Access release. The missions, whether it's the lumber delivery I talked about earlier, unlocking new vehicles hidden around the world, or revealing the map by driving near 'cloaking' points, are uninspiring. How long you'll stick with the game depends on how compelling you find those ponderous, muddy drives between objective markers. It's an achingly slow, fiddly game, and you'll need a lot of patience to endure the hardships you'll encounter as you traverse the game's five maps.Still, endurance is what Spintires is all about, and there's a lot of satisfaction to be had in besting the brutal Russian terrain in your hardy little Soviet truck—but not after a lot of rolling over, getting inescapably lodged in soggy riverbeds, and running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. I love that games like this exist. It's why I love PC gaming. But as endearingly bizarre as I find Spintires, and as much as I admire the technology, I can't say I really ever enjoyed it. There are moments of what I could loosely call excitement—like almost rolling over and spilling my load just metres from the delivery point, or thinking I was crossing a shallow pond only to become totally submersed in a river—but they're few and far between. Mostly I just find myself swearing at mud.			"

												As one of the closed beta testers and been following along with this game since the early stages, I can higly recomend this game to anyone who is a fan of trucks, simulators, or just amazing games. There are great things going for this game, a great development team working on it and a wonderful growing dedicated community to back it. There are many wonderfull modders out there as creating quality content to enjoy. The trucks are absolutly beautiful and well detailed, the maps are very great as well, a great challenge and a load of fun!			"

												I have over 500 hours in SpinTires and over 300 hours in the SpinTires editor creating custom maps for the game. After reading a lot of the negative reviews I realize why some people think this game is not worth the money. It is true the developers have been very slow on releasing any updates but the modders have taken this game and turned it into the best offroading game out there. Custom Vehicles: Currently the game now has workshop support for all modded vehicles. All you have to do now is subscribe and at map selection you can pick whatever vehicle you want to drive. Modders like Sid, Brute, Vengeful Maniac and many others have created highly detailed and realistic offroading rigs to drive.Custom Maps:  There are tons of free maps made by modders on spintires.nl. The maps are usually around a 50mb to 100mb download. They come in a zip file. You open up the zip and there are two level folders inside. All you do is drop those in your Spintires/Levels folder and start the game up. You will have to disable achievements to play with custom maps and trucks.The other mod that makes this game amazing is Spintiresplus. Its a simple download and install from Spintires.nl.  You simply drop the files into your main Spintires folder and its done. It has a config file that you can edit with notepad to change little things in the  game like a battery winch so you can flip your vehicle back over if you get stuck without any friends around.If you can handle that little bit of mod installation then this is hands down the best offroading game out there with new maps and vehicles being released on almost a daily basis.

												This game is fun, and if you enjoy offroading there are certainly some hairy moments that will keep you on the edge.  The reason for me not recommending is because this is not a finished product.  I would agree this is an alpha or pre-release, and were it marketed this way I would be fine with it, but I thought I was buying a finished product.  If you want to try a finished product, wait for about a year.  1.  There are no saves in multiplayer, if the host loses an internet connection, everyone, including the host, are kicked to the main menu and 100% of the progress is lost.  You cannot continue the game the next day.2.  You only get a very crappy 3rd person view.  Its nice when you are trying to get out of a bind, but worthless if you are trying to drive through a trail or a straight line.3.  There are 6 maps, but all of them are the same thing, with slightly different surroundings.  You take logs from point A to point B while trying not to get stuck in 5 foot deep mud pits every 20 yards.  Nothing else to this game.4.  Exploring is not even fun, since there is too much mud.  ""It is not drive for a bit, and oh, there's some mud.""  Its ""yeah, finally got out of the mud, oh wait there's more.""  I spend 95% of my time in 1st gear, Differential locked, and all wheel  drive engaged.  Otherwise you get stuck every 20 feet.5.  The developers have promised more content, such as fixing the bugs, views, and adding more content, but again, this is supposed be a finished product.6.  There are mods out there, but you cannot  use any and play multiplayer.13 July 2014Folks, if you do not like my review, that's ok, but I really do not care.  It is my opinion.  Any fanboy comments that do little more than insult me or my review are simply deleted, please do not waste your time.  There is nothing I have written that is untrue about this game.			"

												Honestly, if it weren't for the mods (vehicle and map add-ons) I would not recommend Spintires due to the lack of content and variety the core game has at the full price. I personally feel it's a good deal on sale at $15 or less for any driver gamer. With all the mods I've seen, it's barely worth the full price ($30) to me. Maps are downloaded and added manually. None are thru Steam at this time.This is also, somewhat, a niche game; off-road simulation/sandbox-ish.You choose a map and your vehicles and choose what you want to do:Rock climb, race/mudder/mudding, explore, test/derp in the different vehicles or actually try to complete the objectives which ever way you want to try.My complaints that I can live with are: there is only 1 set of engine sounds. Every vehicle sounds the same. The camera angles are horrible. And my SLI rig doesn't seem to like something about the game.This game isn't for everybody. Check out videos of different gameplay and see if it's for you.BTW, I do have a T150 steering wheel. The steering wheel itself and force feedback does add so much to immerse yourself into the game.

												This game came out and it looked so fantastic, and it was for a short time. Then Ovee showed its real ugly head and just broke the game. Its been out for over a year, nothing has changed in the game so far. Things we still dont have:Multiplayer savesMod suportMultiple new mapsNew featuresMultiple save filesNow you might say: Well duh obviously they havent done this. But before you dismiss it as me complaining for the sake of complaining. These features were promised to us MONTHS AGO. They keep delaying it and then never speaking about it again, and it sucks. The devs and the managing company of this game do not get along.We were witness to a very nasty and public fight between the lead dev and the management company where the dev accused the company of trying to steal the product, censoring him and locking him out of developing for the game.Ovee, the managing company first dismissed it as lies, but broke under public pressure and apologized both to the dev and the community for lying to us.Since then they have posted numerous time lines, and updates of development that can be summed up like this: ""We had a meeting, we talked about features and updates we wanted to do, but we achieved nothing"".Dont get this game. Ovee does not deserve to recieve more cash for this game. The game is ""okay"" at best at its current stage, as Ovee with every small update introduces numerous game breaking bugs that they are incapable of fixing. Not to mention that every patch they put out will corrupt your save files. So dont think you can keep a game going for a while.Let us vote with our wallet, and stop supporting this game untill it ends up with another managing corperation. If Ovee wont support the dev and the community, the community will not support them.Rise my friends, run away!			"

												Journal Entry 1 We have decided to start things off with a crawl through the mud and explore the deep forest's sloppy loose ground. We both select the 8 wheel monster unimog. I start it up, a gritty deep pumping sound echoes as I kick her into gear, A billow of black diesel smoke bursts from the stacks... nothing like the smell of rollin coal in the mornin... off we go. Journal Entry 2 After pitting ourselves against a few easy mud holes we decide to cross the roaring river. My buddy goes first, boom he drives off the shore and nose dives into the river, he takes a small amount of damage from water getting in his intake. The current is smashing up against his truck but due to the trucks weight its not going anywhere. My turn, I take a more gentle approach and kinda softly lay the front end into the water and creep across, this approach allowed the truck to level out more gently and keep the intake above water. Once we emerged from the other side the mud was mostly washed off the tires revealing the thick gnarly tread. Journal Entry 3 My buddy has finally met a mud hole that bested his truck, He is up to his windows in a pit of mud, spinning his tires and tossing large chunks of earth every which way.... ""Your gonna have to give me a push"" he says.... ok here we go.... I slam it into gear and plow ahead through the soupy mud, im not getting much speed but this should be enough.... WAM! I smack right into his rear end pushing his truck enough to give it some traction, he just barely crawls out.... but now we have a problem.... I'm now wedged in his previous position ...stuck... for a quick second all this could remind me of was curling..... one rock bumps out the other... Journal Entry 4 I spun, locked and unlocked my diffs, ripped and turned leaving a horrid gouge in the ground... take that mother nature... My buddy decided to try and hit me from the side but his efforts have now landed onto his side and unable to move....crap... Luckily him hitting me allows some movement, after about 15-20 mins of slowly grinding my truck inch by inch through the mud backwards I am able to get traction on the bank and dig out. Now I gotta get my buddy turned back on his wheels.. I loop around and try to ram his side to knock him upright.... well... I miss calculated a hill during my trajectory... my truck flips over on its side literally facing my buddies window.... now were looking directly at each other flipped over on our sides in almost like a mirror image.... ""hi"" he says..... we both burst out laughing.... RESTART! Journal Entry 5 After starting over we have now taken on the roles of loggers, we rig out our trucks with large cranes and a short jeep trailer behind us. We start trekking north in search for the lumber we need to collect and haul back. Along the way we come across another viscous mud hole, my buddy charges forward and boom stuck.... I run up behind him to push and also bottom out... darn were both stuck.... now what? ... Well these handy dandy self loading trucks are able to dispense their hydrolic crane arms! We both pull out our crane rigging and begin to push and heave into the ground, their is so much power that the crane easily lifts the truck out of the mud, we fiddle around pushing each other and spider walking our trucks through the mud until we are free.  Journal Entry 6 Its finally nighttime, The trucks headlights kick in and shine gloriously off the dark trees and lighting up the old overgrown roads. Our truck's rigging smashes and clangs as we run over large rocks and trees, the whole feeling is very rugged and industrial. We finally arrive at our destination, a small logging camp with piles of timber already processed and waiting to be loaded. We are both far too tired after the long drive, time to head for bed and load up our trailers in the morning ;)			"

												DUMPED by the dev/pub after they had horrible relations with each other. Speculation and backlash abound!  Such tragedy. Very sad.  However, game is in a mostly stable, ""finished"" state here on Steam, and runs excellent on my modest machine.  Great fun for a while, hauling timber around and such.  HOWEVER, many things were promised ages ago, and many comedians and actors have died since, yet none such promises have come to fruition.  Shame I cannot recommend an abandoned project, even if it did have great potential.  10/10.  Would wonder if a game would ever be finished again.			"

There's some issues with developers and community, but I really like this game though since game is playable and I don't see nothing wrong about it.Game even has a multiplayer, so you can work as a team and build up your teamwork skills with each other.Two tips: ""Don't get stuck"" and ""think before you act"".

												Edit 2: To be blunt, this ""game"" aka tech demo still is crap with little content, and now the publisher isn't paying the guy who made this game, so now more than ever:DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEYes the physics are fantastic. Yes the terrain deformation is fantastic, until you realize all you'll be doing in this game is getting stuck in this OP mud as soon as you carry any load. This isn't an off-road simulator, its a winching simulator because all you do is get stuck in mud. There is no rock crawling or technical off-roading where you have to worry about articulation or angles, just mud. The devs found how to make cool mud in video games and just put it everywhere. I remember during a YouTube live stream the devs admitted they never actually had any off-roading experience. This should have been a red flag for me and IT SHOULD BE A RED FLAG FOR YOU, because it definitely shows in the game.Furthermore, this is still nothing more than a glorified tech demo at its current stage. There is VERY little to do in it. Maybe if they continue to update this with more things to actually do it will be worth the price, but in its current form I feel like I wasted $26 (I got it on sale) on the same game that was a free demo a few months ago, with the addition of moving logs... Yippie. Unless there are some MAJOR content updates for this game, save your money and get the free demo, because you really won't be missing out on anything at this point.This is a great physics engine but the people behind SP should give the rights to a studio that can make an actual video game with it.Edit: just to be clear, this review is coming from someone with 45+hrs on Euro Truck Sim 2 and 100+hrs on Microsoft Flight Sim X. I can appreciate a good sim/casual/therapeutic/whatever game. This is not one of those games.			"

												I would love to recommend this game. I had a lot of fun with it and would even say it was worth my money. Granted, there is not really much to do, but just driving those truck through the mud and getting stuck brought enjoyment to me.But here is the thing: Oovee promised a lot of content, even previewed it, and then gave no more updates on their progress.

												Good idea and platform, but it's not even close to $30.00 worth of content, it has 7 different trucks (though 2 are pretty much useless) 5 maps, no single player career (it doesnt even save your progress inbetween maps), no mod support and no steering wheel support. The Dev's are dishonest and string people along and just use the same excuses  ""we're a small team it takes a while"" ""we are really busy everyone is working their ♥♥♥ off"" ""our only programmer is on vacation for a month"" and than get their shills to repeat the same thing, ignoring the fact that these were things THEY promised us in a few weeks not 3 or 4 months.  When the game came out they promised major updates with in the following few weeks, a few months later the list has gotten smaller and it keeps getting pushed back.  My biggest hope for this game is that Ovee gets bought out and some one who has their s*** together starts managing this project because it has huge potential but it seems to take them for ever to impliment the biggest changes. By late 2015 early 2016 this should be an amazing game, till than don't hold your breath.			"

												Bought this game for something to fulfill my weekend and im dam glad I did get it, wish i bought this ages ago Lets look at the game i give honest opinion, there is alot of things that could be changed in the game, but the  way the developers have put it together they have made it work.Pros:Game looks great and is not to much load on your PC, handling is also has a great feel to it, the multilayer side of it works well if you play  with friends, maps are just the right size to have fun on them, controller support i used a mixture of gamepad and keyboard which is not really necessary but work well for me.Cons:Camera view and camera control can be rather frustrating at times, no vehicle select when choosing your map, sounds are a little odd at times, no wheel support at the time of this review, few extra buttons would be great, multilayer lobby campers people with rooms that never start the game Overall its a good game and can be quite addictive and easy to loose track of time, the main reason i delayed buying this game was due to no wheel support, but after playing it im not sure if its highly important, thew is room for improvement and it does leave door wide open to DLC not sure what future holds for this game but im hope its a good one.Very enjoyable is it worth the price I would say yes.

												Spin Tires is the premier 4x4 game available today. It's physics and graphics blow away any other 4x4 game on the market. If you want an off-road simulation game, then look no further than Spin Tires. It does have a few bugs, but those are over-shadowed by the fun that can be had playing a game with friends. Just when you think you've got a map or a route figured out, everything can and may go wrong. You may have taken a trail a few dozen times before without fault, then suddenly find your truck buried in the mud or worse yet, rolled onto it's side, dumping your load of lumber in the process. I keep playing it for the unpredictability inherent in such a game. You just never know how the game will play out. You may complete a game without fail or you may fail, fail and fail again. In my opinion, the best part of the game is when you fail, then overcome your fail by getting that truck out of the situation you put it in, then use it to deliver a load to the objective.			"

One of the only accurate offroad simulators out there. And it is highly modable! I dont play the actual game itself very often, most of my time is spent on trialing maps driving around in mods, very rarely do i do the logging maps. However, those are very fun aswell. NOTE: It takes a long time and A LOT of patience to get good at the game. If you dont have any patience, dont waste your time. However if you have the time and patience, and love a good challenge, this is the game for you!PROS: Great gameplay, lots of fun, highly moddable, easily moddable, great challengeCONS: Biggest problem i have with the game is the camera, im not a massive fan of the camera, it takes a long time to get used to and it can be very derpy at times, however there are a few mods out there that help with it "

												HONK HONK!!! One of the cooolest driving games ever. In fact now that I am writing this I am going to re-install it and see if I can get my friends to do the same. Shouldn't be a problem. We had some great co-op gaming sessions with this spectacular piece of game design. Fording a raging river and watching your bud not only submerge his entire vehicle under the excellently rendered water, but re-emerge unscathed to get a Steam achievement and continue on his way to re-fuel another stranded friend was one of the best co-op gaming moments in history. Just sorry I don't have video of it.The way the mud deforms around the tires, hearing the truck bog down, having a guy pull up and winch you out. TOTALLY AWESOME! Big Russian trucks. Mud. Water. Forests. Unforgiving terrain if you stray from the roads/paths.  TOTALLY AWESOME!It's not perfect. The campaign is fairly limited in terms of game mechanics. Go here, pick up logs, take logs to depot. Maybe stop off and unlock some of the hidden vehicles around the map. Go and refuel your friends. Or pull them out. But, I refer to my earlier comment. TOTALLY AWESOME!! I give this game a 8.5 out of 10. Not perfect but very very good.			"

												I am simply gonna say this game is AWESOME! update: this game has ruined it for other games in my steam account, been playing it at least 6-8 hours in the past 2 days, despite its simplisty, there is too much do apart from carrying logs, especially when playing it hardcore, since you`ll have to tow the other trucks, refuel them, repair them, in case they got damaged or ran out of fuel, so a single log delivery takes more than just a loading taking the road and unloading, cuz you simply cannot expect what will happen, you might damage your car on the way or run out of fuel, it`s just the kind of game I was looking for, and by the way this is only the original game, there are alot of mods you can install for it! original review:- I purchased it less than aday ago and I have already gone 8 hours on it, if your outdoorsie, love off-roading even for a little bit, this is the game for u.- I come from a background of truckers and off-roaders where my grandfather was a hardcore heavy machinery, with trucks parts everything business and my uncles are all truck drivers or off roaders. so when I saw this game on steam for 40% I was like what is that game, clicked on it, watch some videos and was amazed by how great it looks, and the mud, omg the mud, my this thing is the best off-road simulator ever. - it is the exact feeling and effect I get when I drive my nissan xterra and jeep liberty in the mud or off roading, the engine roaring, the exhaust of the trucks, the water everything bring back memories, the only thing that is missing is the smell of diesel when u step on a truck, it`s just amazing.-visuals:- the game utilizes an engine call veeEngine, which is basically made specificly for this game, and is build from the ground up, so it`s perfectly optimized for pc, along with all the physics, altering enviorment, ground etc, and water, it won an intel award in 2009 using direct x9 technologies. the game looks surprisingly good, I swear man when I saw the videos I was like, damn it my system wont be able to play it since it looks so good, I have sli gtx 670 4gb, and believe it or not it only uses 60% of only 1 gtx 670 for a 1440p monitor, this is crazy, this engine puts other engines to shame, and yes I may dare to say cryengine 3 or whatever it name is, maybe a notch below but cmon this game can be played with intel graphics with ease, and it makes me wonder why others game are not utilized like this, all I have to say in visuals is that this engine opened a new possibilies in pc gaming that we never saw before. - gameplay:- I know I havn`t played much, but the mud playing, engine roaring and nice effects make this game very re-playable, cuz the ground never stays the same, the roads are the same but what happens is that u maybe lucky and encounter a dry road or a very muddy, lacky road, it depends, and thats whats great about this game, controls are very easy and it has full controller support, so u can play with mouse keyboard or gamepad or of course a wheel.  also you get to do simple missions such as transporting lamber wood, and parts, there are trucks scattered all around the map that unlock when ur close to them, and believe me when I tell u every truck drives and feels very different, the devs did a really good job in simulating the real feel driving off-road. if get stuck in the mud u go back to garage grab a good toing truck to get ur truck out of mud. it`s just there is too much to do, there is even a multiplayer that I havn`t got into yet. - value:- I mean really it depends, I purchased this game for 18$ and its original price is 30$, for me I would gladly pay 30$ why? cuz this is a game that I would actually play, I have like 20 or 30 games in my account that I havn`t even played it, I just keep buying them and stacking them up cuz they were in discount, I stopped doing that and starting to look only for the games that I am seriously into, and this game is one of them, I mean I can`t get enough of it, there is too much to do in this game. the only problem is that the game feels a bit incomplete, but there are very minor bugs so the game is perfectly playable. if you thinking of buying it just do it if your into this kind of gaming style :)			"

												While I've rarely enjoyed driving games, I was flabberghasted by how much I was taken in by Spintires. The below lists my impressions on its respective pros and cons:Pros: You drive large, powerful, Russian Military trucks that rumble over most terrain with ease. The graphics are impressive, and don't even take that much processing power to render beautifully. While the base game only comes with 8 vehicles, and 6 maps, great modding support for the game makes up for it. It feels like a peaceful game. A great way to wind down after a long day and mellow out. Fun and functional game mechanics. A steep initial learning curve, but very easy to get used to in a short time. Again: Big, beastly Russian military trucks! <3 I've always found such kinds of truck overwhelmingly awesome, which is what compelled me to try the game out. Lots of fun extra features are planned for release in future updates.Cons: With each update to the game, it looks like your saves are rendered invalid, erasing your progress for a specific map. Luckily, you likely won't depend on saves THAT much, as most maps don't take overly long to finish. Updates to the game haven't been very regular either, so it's not much of a worry. No multiplayer VoIP, and text chat feels unoptimized. If your Steam username contains special ACSII symbols, they have to be edited out first, otherwise the multiplayer chat can't send any message you type. No first-person, cabin view of your truck. Driving is done from a third-person view, or from a fixed camera just above your truck's cab. You'd figure that this would be a basic feature for a driving game, however the developers have listed this as a future feature yet to be introduced. No tracked vehicles. Another feature that's set to be introduced later. Given the terrain you get to drive through, vehicles with tank-tracks will not only be freaking sweet, they'll be supremely helpful =)I fully recommend this title. whether you enjoy driving games, the aesthetic of Russian military vehicles, the idea of logging in the Russian Taiga, or any combination of those points. Spintires provides both a relaxing gaming experience, as well as a challenging one, should you choose it to be. Прощай, and happy logging!			"

												Nice game, but not great.Physics: 11/10 (no jokes)Graphics: 9/10Controls: 6/10 it's very weird to control the camera with the mouse so you need a controllerGameplay: 6/10 missions are boringMenu 5/10 Very weird menuAlso this game hasn't a tutorial or something so when you purchase it at first you will not understand anything.You won't find missions or anything but just maps.Overall it's a good game but all of your money ($24) are going to graphics and physics.Gameplay and missions are bad.Very bad for the money you're paying for...i dont want to be a hater but i'm just saying you how the game looks like.Also you can find plenty of cars on community workshop and you could try them out.

												Time, patience, skill and the heart to watch your truck and payload rollover into a ditch without throwing your computer out the window are what you'll need to play this game. It's brutally hard and unforgiving but an extremely satisfying offroad simulator. The premise is very basic. Explore and unlock (or decloak as they call it) the map to reveal hidden vehicles and structures. Collect them and then proceed to deliver loads of lumber to the designated sites. You can customize your vehicles loadouts and tools at garages you've unlocked and use the map and compass to plan your route. You'll need it, plan or drive poorly and you'll be rewarded with a mouthful of mud/water and trying again.There are repair trucks, refueling trucks, winch/rescue trucks and loading cargo trucks some even with their own fully operable cranes. There are also smaller scout vehicles like jeeps for mapping and finding the points of interest. Escort your delivery trucks with the needed support vehicles to ensure they arrive safely at their destination. The game support mulitplayer sessions as well and this is where it really shines, allowing you to form offroad convoys with your friends and help each other out, each person filling a needed roll in the convoy.Its sandbox style maps allow you to go anywhere and do anything at any time. My only gripe is the game lacks a traditional save/load feature. It saves continously and automatically saves as you play and you can quit at any time and can continue later where you left off. But you can't save half way through an attempted delivery or before a risky maneuver and then reload if things go horribly wrong (which they frequently do). This means if you screw up, you have to either reset your vehicle and try again or attempt to winch yourself out of trouble and continue the fight. This can be both intensely frustrating or satisfying if you're really hardcore about it. It certainly teaches you to be careful and not drive with reckless abandon. Regardless, there needs to be an option for it IMO.The devs have promised regular updates and content additions in the following months which is good and we'll see. But for a kickstarter backed, small dev project it's remarkably polished and delivers alot of offroad driving pleasure.8.5/10 overall			"

												Im sorry, no matter how much I want to like it, I just cant. I have listed complaints as suggestions to the developers.Multiplayer ComplaintsRandom people join games and you cannot kick them if they are annoying.If the server crashes, then you loose connectivity on the client (well kinda obvious) but you also loose all progress (hours of work)There is no saving multiplayer.Multiplayer depends on the steam networking (i.e. you must be signed into steam)All Multiplayer vehicles of the same type spawn on top of each other, causing damage to vehicles due to collisions when you drive awayThere is no mechanism to drive another players vehicleRejoining a game that you disconnected from  (i.e. game crash) requires you to unlock all acheivements again (even if the server has stayed online).If another player switches trucks, it dissapears. If they switch back it reappears, even if you are driving on top of it.Complaints for the Game in GeneralWhile the destructible mesh is great, and its really cool it remembers the form of destruction along with the heightmap, dont you think that its a little too much mud? Very far on the unrealistic side coming from a person who worked logging in the mountains. Spring runnoff only causes so much mud. Also while there are some awesome 3 meter mudholes, not every mudhole needs to be that deep. Realistically there should be a mechanism to dump pebbles into a mudhole, or more appropriatly sacrifice some poorly tapered logs to the worst mudholes.There needs to be a visible minimap, and perhaps a cab driving perspective (preferably with secondary cameras on each side showing the tire position). If you want to go for realism, only the drivers side.Gear shifting mechanics need to be adjusted (I dont know about Russian trucks, but many of this era truck had spider gears, or at least more than 3 gears). Furthermore the gear transitions are mouse based and non granular, this is problematic.What exactly is the crane for? It cant seem to move the trucks, nor pickup logs. Kinda cool, but wished it did something. "

												Most People when they look at buying SpinTires look at its 30$ price tag and think ""is it worth it""I know there are bugs still and some framerate hiccups whe you park a lage amount of vechicles in one area and another bug would be when 2 light sorces in one area it will make the only area you can see is where youre headlights are   ...  granted you dont need them to see at night anyways as well the long log cart can sometimes have a tire bug out and go underground this has only ever happened when at the garage area attaching it. now im done with the bugs  The gameplay can be grindy at times but other times you will ither be frustarated or flying to the finish with a grin  the game is designed to be a challenge so it can get frusarating when you flip over your biggest truck or you could have a clear run with no hiccups and be like ""yea its done"" but the best runs are where youre going in blind and juding the landscape before action and creating a struggle within the game to get to the objective without fliping or breaking your truck as well as making sure you have enough fuel for your ventures  on those runs you will be smileing because you overcame a challenge not because it was a uneventful jouny.Graphics are asstounding the mud and vechicle deformation is the best ive seen the only other games ive seen that goes into this level is Beam NG Drive ( same devepoers of Rigs of Rods) , Next Car Game , Rigs Of Rods , of course these games are damaged based this one is mud based and the damage physics on the trucks seems to not be affectid by what you hit where you it it unlike the games i listedMultiplayer- the multiplayer within SpinTires is local host so you can have up to 4 people in one game session there are some sync bugs that have yet to be patched but this feture can speed up game sessions and help new people to the game learn how to react to there inviroment accordingly  and of course play with youre friends / palsin my own opinion this game is worth the 30$ price tag if you intend on playing it for a while and if you like challenge as well as acheivement hunting some aheavements are a challenge in themself as well as this the game  Supports  modding which extends its playability and can even bring to light more styles of gameplay one being to poencially build bridges of all kinds when it comes to getting across a river or vally "

												After playing a mere 4 hours of the game since I bought it yesterday, I feel like I can safely write a review. Reasons I put off buying for so long:	-Played the demo ages ago and got bored, plus it performed badly.-Slightly expensive.-Seemed very 1-ended, very linear.-Thought I would bore of it in mere minutes. Reasons I finally bought the game:	-I had some money and couldn't decide what to do with it.-My brother really wanted me to get it. Reasons this game is absolutely AMAZING: -I have a GTX960 for a GPU, and while some other games stutter, this game gives a CONSTANT 60 FPS on absolute HIGHEST settings.  The graphics in this game are  INSANELY  nice looking!-The developers have done an amazing job with the physics of the trucks; I love the ""heavy"" feeling of the vehicles.  Each truck handles differently than each other, and each one has its own challenges to overcome!-Every single part on the vehicles seems to be animated, from the suspension to the chains and hooks.-Immense customization for each vehicle, you can make a whole fleet of loggers, tankers and rescue trucks!-A nice array of maps to choose from, with the ability to  choose starting vehicles.  Each map is extremely well made!-The developers have made literally EVERYTHING on the map interactive; from the deformable terrain (you will hate mud after you finish playing for a while), to rocks, trees, and bushes!-A nice career feel to the game, with you having to first go ahead and scout to remove cloaking from the map, as well as find paths to fuel stations and lumberyard/objectives.-Trucks burn fuel at different levels depending on each model, and whether dif lock and AWD are enabled.-Controls are very easy to set up, and are simplistic from the beginning.-The game really requires you to think about the route you are taking, in order to not cause damage to your truck or load.-An excellent group of devs as well as a phenomenal community of modders! Reason the game could be better: -The ONLY complaint I have that would make the game better would be an interior camera.  The camera options as of now leave a lot to be desired, and make it very difficult to see at some points. Overview All-in-all, the pros of this game FAR outweigh the cons, and there is absolutely NO reason not to buy this game!  I would not hesitate to buy it again, even if it was 10-15 dollars more expensive (which I honestly think they could get away with).  FINAL SCORE: 9.8/10   "

												This isn't a game.  What this is instead is still the glorified tech demo with a ""game"" sprinkled (poorly) over the top.While this game is pretty, and the physics are impressive, this isn't a foundation for a full game.I've never encountered a driving game with a ""fog of war"" style mechanic, and a game that focusses on difficult, technical driving makes this massively frustrating.  If this is trying to be a simulator, I can't possibly imagine anyone driving off road without a map and a plan of the terrain or route they're wanting to follow.  Realistically, on any level, the first ""objective"" is to clear all the fog of war, just so you can see the damned map and where you're going to do the main objective.The driving is also frustratingly slow primarily due to the vast amount of mud and mud deformation used which will bog down nearly any vehicle incredibly quickly and the constant rescuing/winching rapidly grows tiresome.  While this is an off-roading game, even the ""main"" roads are rutted so heavily that any form of progress is also painfully slow.  The mud is also so prevalent that there is no reason to ever turn off the all-wheel drive or the diff-locks as it's virtually impossible to make any real progress with these turned off.  The vehicles that i've encountered so far include a small jeep, which will also get stuck incredibly easily and even on the main roads, a rear-wheel-drive only truck which again gets stuck far too easily, and several larger 6 and 8 wheeled trucks that you'll end up using for pretty much everything, including basic scouting.Vehicles can be customised to a basic extent with the addition of repair kits or additional fuel tanks which can then be used on the truck to which they are applied, or to other nearby trucks.  The fuel tank add-ons are incredibly annoying as the basic garages at which you select the upgrades, and of which there are generally only one or two on a map, do not fill these fuel tanks.  Instead, you must take these tanks to a dedicated fuelling station which are usually a long distance from the starting garages and again assume that you've removed the fog of war on the map to actually see where they are and so you can plan a route to them.  Worse is that the main objectives of lumber delivery usually has you travelling a long way to get from the starting garage to the lumber yard, and then an incredibly long way to the final delivery point.  This distance is usually so great that it's impossible to do this journey on a single tank of fuel.While on the subject of objectives; Fog of War only removes at specific map locations and there are approximately 10 of these points per map.  Garages require special points to unlock which are in the form of an upgrade to a truck that acts as a ""load"" that needs to be delivered which i've found to take 2 journeys to unlock (I realise there is a larger trailer that should do it in one journey, though again this gets stuck far too often), and the main lumber delivery objective which as far as i've encountered, also requires two full journeys to complete.A typical playthrough of a level will consist of: starting, driving forward 10 yards and getting stuck, turning on the all-wheel drive, and the diff-locks and then leaving them on for the remainder of the game.  Next, open the map, set a market for one of the fog of war checkpoints, head towards it and promptly get stuck, faff around for a while trying to get unstuck, get within 100 metres of the checkpoint only to find there's no access from that direction, try and go around, get stuck, more faffing, eventually find the checkpoint, get stuck or roll over just outside the specific zone required, faff trying to rescue the vehicle, reset, start again.  Repeat this for each of the checkpoints and then try and do similar for the actual ""main"" objective.Generally the vehicles control reasonably well; there's a weight and momentum to vehicles, although a frustrating and clumsy camera system makes it very difficult to properly see what's going on in certain situations.TL:DR?Pros:Pretty visualsGood vehicle physicsCons:No actual gameplay, still just a tech demo / showcase for mud deformation""Fog of War"" for map in a game emphasising navigationVehicles get stuck far too easily			"

												I find it strange that I like this game as much as I do. After all I get easily frustrated and angry when I get my car stuck in the snow. But I find SPINTIRES delightful and satisfying from how much hard work it forces you to put into it.SPINTIRES is a game that puts you in the middle of some isolated forest or marsh, and your goal is to deliver logs from the lumber yard to the mill. Sounds straightforward.However, the terrain will prove to be your biggest obstacle. Most 'roads' are nothing more than muddy trenches, destinations sit at the top of steep hills, and it will become necessary to haul logs and trailers through rivers...which may end in disaster. Fortunately, you have some pretty hefty trucks at your disposal, a couple of which can barrel over smaller trees with no problem.The aforementioned satisfaction comes from trudging through the mud and reaching your destination with your load intact. There's a wonderful sense of accomplishment when you get your vehicle stuck and manage to winch yourself to a tree and pull yourself out.The physics SPINTIRES is something to boast about. The terrain changes under your tires, depending on the vehicle you're operating; mud gets kicked up, roads get chewed up, small bridges might collapse under your weight.You can play more casually by respawning your vehicle to an unlocked garage or not have to worry about shifting gears manually. But there is a hardcore mode where respawning is disabled, providing a more realistic experience; if your vehicle is stuck submerged in a river, you need a bigger truck to pull it out.Even so, at the start of each level your traveller's map will be covered in black spots. To uncover these, for better or for worse, you need to drive to the source of these spots to remove the cloaking. This promotes more aggressive exploration, though this is more of a negative than a positive for some players, as there is no option to have the entire map visible.There is a multiplayer option in SPINTIRES as well as steering wheel support, though there are many people who have had issues with both lately. Briefly glancing through forums, there might be some fixes that can clear up these issues, but hopefully the developers will look into the problems quickly and patch them out.All in all, I highly recommend SPINTIRES. I've sunk a lot of hours into delivering logs across a marsh and walked away feeling satisfied and very entertained. Sounds strange, but, if you give it a try, you might be surprised at how fun it can be.			"

												This game has great potential. I love that the community has changed what the game was intended to be (a logging sim) and made it a sandbox for off-roading creativity. Props to the modders and community for making this moderately decent game phenomenal! They took over where the developer fell short. Definitely look to outside sites to bolster your map collection for variety in trails and terrain (mud, sand, rocks, water, etc). Be sure to check out modders in the workshop named Brute and Spun, they made this game far better.Don't let the negative press scare you away, the community and modders are awesome even if the devs aren't. Would recommend to anyone who has the slightest interest in offroading and simulation.			"

Survive the mud apocalypse.You drive one of seven 1980s Russian trucks on one of five 1000mx1000m freeroam maps, to uncloak the map, to unlock other trucks, to bring lumber from ""lumber"" to ""objective"", to scout one of several routes for doing so, and to winch out all your trucks that got stuck while trying to do the former.You may point out that to bring lumber of A to B is no real challenge, and if you think of other trucking sims like Euro truck Simulator 2, it isn't (there isn't even a game economy), but the challenge is in getting there because the terrain fights dirty (I paid my dues to the pun union, so shut up). You need to fight the mud every step of the way, and the smaller your truck and the heavier your load, the more difficult it gets. There are ruts in the dirt, your trucks will leave ruts in the dirt, you will get stuck in mud, in boggy soil (it's ok if you go fast, but as soon as you slow down...), in loose soil, on rocks, and in the rivers, lakes and puddles (don't go in to deep, the water has it in for you as well). You will tip over and spill your load, then winch yourself back upright and pick the logs up with a crane. You will repair and refuel yourself and others. You will slip off a rough log bridge carrying a heavy load. You will snag on tree stumps and logs. You will bump against trees and waltz over them.It's you and your truck against the terrain.If you think that's boring, don't buy.download the demo[spintires.com]Be aware though, some people have complained that the game plays ""too much like the demo"", i.e. they imagined features from the demo that the game doesn't have currently. There's no tutorial, no career system, just maps and trucks and mud, and you can deliver lumber and load it with a crane, and you get achievements, some of which are challenges that may take you awhile to master. You get 5 maps in the game (I find them sufficiently diverse, even if certain terrain features like pieces of track are copied & pasted), you get 7 trucks, and different tires and equipment for most. There are a lot of mods hosted on the official site and others, but so far installing them means messing with the game files; I expect support for that will be here before the end of the year, but you might not be able to use them in multiplayer.

												Very impressive game for a game that requires less than 1GB (around 500-600MB). Made a good list about the game that I have been listing since I first played the game.PRO:- Terrain can be deform (mud puddles), trail marks- The exhaust pipes shakes violently and spew thick smoke when gasing the trucks - Realistic water physics- The physics on the vehicles (speed, weight, balance, etc.)- Maps are decent sizes, and each area has its own unique full of challenges - Small trees can be run over- 4 Co-op muliplayer- Suspensions are realisitcs- Vehicles of all sizes, ranging from the UAZ (Jeep) to the monstrous 8x8 Maz.- Winching is fun and very useful. You can attach it to both other vehicles and trees if you are ever stuck or need to pull out a player from the ditch.- Attaching a crane to your truck, to pick up lumber, move rocks out of the way and sometimes to help push the truck up.- Trucks take damage, and consume fuel. You can install a utility addon for mobile repairs, or a fuel cistern for re-fueling in the field.CONS:- Camera need to have different choices for the player to pick- Maps should be different such as winter, desert, and a village would be nice- More players to be in the muliplayer (Should have 6-8 players rather than 4, feels lonely in certain areas with other players)- The only official objective is to bring lumber, could use more different objectives - Only one map will save your progress at a time (each map should have their own saves)- Point of veiw distance should be customizable, noticed some areas are blurry even with settings maxed.- Vehicle should be customizable such as colors, headlights, your own insigna on the doors- More vehicles, maybe a tank? :D Overall a great game that I can play on my laptop when I am away from home. :D			"

												In this review I am to write on my personal opinion on what makes Spin tires a good game however also mention key points which need improving.Positives.. Most realistic off road game there is currently.. The graphics are beatiful and the fact you can alter the terain is stunning.. The game runs well on lower spec PC's.. Multiplayer gameplay is very enjoyable and awarding at the same time.. Map designs are fantastic.. The crane system at first is very confusing however once you get the hang of it, it's very enjoyable experience.. Sounds are very realistic and fantastic.Negatives.. There are glitches in the game which I have personally experienced, theses range from missing one of my rear dulley wheels, managing to flip over the biggest and heaviest truck in the game while towing one of the smaller trucks, and lastly having my medium load come off my trailer however didn't break down and was stuck to my trailer, which In the end I had to get another trailer. Will note theses are rare occurrences and I have only experienced theses issues once..  The fact you can not load your fellow online players or friends with logs via the crane due to the logs being clicent based and not sever based.. Online games seem to have alot of leavers when games are starting.. Must have a good internet connect to host severs or objectives will not count.. Feels that the game isn't quite finished yet.Worthy mentions.. Having more content and maps in the game.. Having a more advance weather system, rain, snow, thunder and lighting.. Seems that the dev team seem to be slow on updates and news..  Some maps have certainly similarities example some roads and off road tracks but most maps do make up for this.. There is an modding scene however I havn't experienced so I can not make a comment however what I have heard it's ment to be amazing. All I know if you mod your game you can not go on to muliplayer for the time being.. Camera view takes some time to get use to but expecting updates for this in the near future.Summary.Overal I think the game is an very enjoyable experience and since currently it's the only game type of this kind I would say give it a try, however knowing that there are still  issues and the lack of content might put a few people off, however even if you are not a fan of driving simulators which might change your opinion. A must is if you know or can get friends to buy this game aswell it will totally transform the game and lead to many hours of enjoyment. If you are still not sure wheather or not you want to purchase Spin tires I would highly reccomend spending a few moments on youtube of game play and possiblely modding if that floats your boat.

												Well it's mid July (2016) right now, and the game has been stagnating for a long ♥♥♥ time. It was a mistake to launch this game without wheel support, and a cab view, one of which they fixed, wheel support, but still no cab view. The devs seem to be active, at least they  are sending messages out, but still no real worthwhile game development. What exactly are they doing? The privce is still too high particularly since the game fails in so many areas, despite being great in others. It can't be ignored that the game as it stands, is not bad. The good parts are great! The mod community continues to pump out good content, but it's numourous bugs, stupid camera controls, lack of development and dwindling online multiplayer activity mean that right now... It's not really worth recommending.  I still like it, i want it to succeed, but the devs don't seem to be working on it whatsoever. They are sending messages sure.. but nothing actually happens. Save your money, spend it on something else and come back IF they ever actually do some development on this. Or! if you can pick it up  in a sale at say 80% off, then absolutely. Get it.			"

												Great game, it needs a few things though:- Savegames should work better- You can't rejoin a multiplayer game (which sucks if you get disconnected for any reason)fixed!- You can't see other players' extra trucks except in ghost form.- A spectator mode / replay-cam / in-game replay that you could rewind and play back- More maps- More BIGGER maps- More vehicles (new vehicles + steam workshop as of dec. 2015 !)- More missions- More cargo types- More machines of all kinds (trucks, tracked vehicles, harvesters, bulldozers, excavators, bucket loaders, forklifts, road graders/machines for fixing roads etc.)- More workable machines (like the crane, excavators? for loading cargo and manipulating the terrain?)- More weather effects- More, different seasons, winter, autumn..- More everything!I wish they produced the beforementioned things if not free patches to this game then as DLC's or a sequel for this game! Spintires 2, anyone?After playing for hours you're delivering that last patch of timber, you get low on fuel, all your other trucks are stuck on the other side of the map, your rig is starting to stall with flames coming out the exhaust, but, you deliver. Epic.5/5.			"

												Bought on Steam sale. What a great game. Don't believe the doom merchants. This is original & different. You don't even need a killer PC to run it.  I never thought driving simulated trucks in the  mud could be so much fun. Plenty here to keep interest for many hours. Then theres the mods! Maybe one day the devs may finish it! But even if they don't this is well worth your brass as it is. I never reviewed anything before but this game doesn't seem to have had a fair chance. First the forests. Beautiful & just like a Russian forest should be. Only thing no bears. Yes I have been there & it looks just right. Makes you want to pick mushrooms..... Shame to despoil it by driving over trees really ;-) The veachles drive as you would expect that they would. I've driven heavy forestry machines in this country. And a wide variety of heavy tracktors & all wheel drives. Some here some in Russia. The ones that are comparable are great. Low ground pressure tyres do not grip so well on tarmac, Maybe a bit more road noise on tarmac would be more realistic but you can't have everything. Physics very good for the big trucks. The smaller 4x4's bounce too much. Like they don't have dampers. But thats really nit picking.Sounds are fantastic. Engines roaroing. Mud flying. Water foaming. Then when you've turned the thing over. You can listen to the birds & admire the sunrise. Pity you didn't see the narrow bridge in the dark till it was too late........ What's not to like. Probaly we have to wait for Spintires 15 for perfection but this will do for now.  I can even play it with my kids on my knee as there are nothing to give them nightmares. They say there are bugs. But in a few hours game play I have only once had a truck that got confused about it's diff lock. Recovering it to a garage fixed it.  Snow would be nice. If you havn't seen Russia in the snow you havn't lived. Bit hey theres a mod for that! Morning mists are good.  A lot of fun for big kids like me. Pleasantly surpriced by this one. Usually I get something that won't run on my PC in sale.....Well worth a tenner or thereabouts.  Makes a change from killing things..........Buy it on sale & see for your self.Edit,  After playing this again after a break you can see the developement. The little uaz no longer bounces along & is more real. Quite a number of small improvements that add to the imersion. Some new maps. Still no mod support in multiplayer though the devs havn't given up on this & it will come eventually. A better game than it was when first reviewed & getting better. It's also great value at the current price. Still not seen a bear yet but that doesn't mean there aren't any.... Try it & you will see what I mean....This game requires skill & patience. It is not arcade. If your getting stuck too often then try something different. Don't blame the game!!Just a quick update. Dec 2015.  Been awhile since I wrote this & the game now has a mod editer. Steam Workshop support & a great many updates. The devs are still working on it & at some point there should be a map editor. It just keeps getting better. I give it a rest for awhile. Come back & it's improved again. One of my favourites.			"

												TL/DR below:  Getting-stuck-in-the-mud simulator.  8.5/10In some ways this game may not be considered ""complete"" - but the important question for me is this: is it fun?  (Is it worth my $30?)  My experience thus far has yielded a definite ""yes.""  The only ""objective"" is to pick up logs on one side of the map, and deliver them to another.  Sounds simple, doesn't it?  Even on ""casual"" mode - this is far more challenging than I thought, and in the best possible way.  If you enjoy carefully navigating heavy vehicles through terrain they have little to no business being on, this game is for you.More specifically:Vehicles:  There are a decent variety, and each has a different feel and driving style.  By default, each has different equipment that serves a different function, though many are customizable and each to a different degree.  Mainly, there is the cargo function, and support functions.  Get your favorite truck stuck in the mud or flip it over making a bad turn?  Whip out the heavy slow one and wench it out!  Smash it into a boulder?  Bring in the repair vehicle.  Run out of fuel?  There's a tanker for that.  Just feel like exploring in something faster?  Go find the little jeep thing stuck in the woods.Driving Mechanic:  Weight plays a huge role in the feel of driving, and once your vehicle is loaded-up, every few yards of movement become a strategic series of decisions.  Should I brave that pile of large rocks or try wading through that pool of uncertain depth?  Is your vehicle sure-footed on 8 wheels but slow as father time - or is it fast as a rabbit but top-heavy like a bobbing-bird?  Seriously - getting stuck in the mud has never been this fun.  The driving feels mostly realistic - certainly enough to suspend my disbelief, and make me feel like I'm really piloting many tons of metal, rubber, and wood through a slimy river-bed.Graphics / Physics:  This is a beautiful game.  Muddy, swampy, sloshy, beautiful.  Not only is the level of graphical detail very impressive, but the physics and voxel deformation match it in kind.  Tires smoosh under the weight of cargo and deform over rocks.  Mud squishes out of the way of your tires and splatters all over your cabin in higly convincing fashion - and it even slowly dries over time.  Water reacts absurdly well to disturbance and current - this might be the most convincing 3d water I've ever seen in a game.  It isn't perfect - but it's still the best I've ever seen.  As mentioned above, the driving and physics thereof are not perfect, but they are better than most when it comes to off-road - and I've never played a game before this one that accurately portrays the feeling of getting bogged-down in wet river-mud.  Seriously.  This is very convincing gloopyness, and the splatter of mud and splash of water are of higher quality than you're likely to see anywhere else.Gameplay:  This is really all about the experience of driving these machines in this environment - that is: big heavy trucks over packed-dirt, wet grass, rivers and puddles, and of course - mud.  Lots of mud.  There is an objective in each map, and near as I can tell it's always the same - but as I said, that doesn't make it a simple task.  There are also ""cloaking points"" - which are basically an alternative to ""fog of war"" that obscure the map, as well as garages and vehicles to discover - and in hardcore mode - to repair, refuel, and reclaim.  Each map is hours of fun.That said - my one gripe on the current version of this game is that starting a different map will overwrite the save from another - so until you finish a map, it's best to stick with the one, as you can continue after quitting the game.  However, the developers have explicitly stated this will change in the next update - so hey!  If this sounds like a dealbreaker to an otherwise awesome experience, put this on your wishlist and check back later.  You might want to check the free tech-demo on their website to get an idea what this is like - that's what I did.  I bought the game at full price, and I am not at all disappointed - $30 very well spent, in my opinon.  The technology in the full game has been pushed a lot farther: every aspect feels better, more polished, and more realistic - but the demo will at least give you a feel for whether you will enjoy this style of driving or not.

												I absolutely love this game, and is one of my favorite driving games of all time. Physics are great, trucks look amazing, and TONS of mods. I can't recommend this game though. If you're on the fence about it, I would wait until a price drop. If you're an off-road nut, then you've probably already made up your mind. Oovee and their ""Developer"" seems to have abandoned this game, and even their own message boards.			"

												The game is really, really, really fantastic. The Steam modding community is amazing and the game itself is fun. But, there is one thing I want the developers to do. Which is to make it playable on a Macbook laptop. Other than that, it's one of my favorite games on my PC library, My PC is not even made for this, being the fact that it has a small processer, but it still runs really smooth. I suggest this to any who wants a realistic offroad simulator or who wants to have fun.			"

												This game was amzing when it was first released, devs did frequent updates and took feed back from the community. The game has some good content but not really enough to keep you interested for more than an hour or two. The problem is with the devs, they have just droppped of the face of the planet, they have promissed better communication and new content over and over again and the community has not see anything for almost a year. This game still feels like an alpha. Its very disheartening to see a game with so much potential and such a large fan base end up like this. On the bright side there is a large modding community for the game, but the core of the game dosnt change....explore a bit.....pick up logs....drag logs through trails to loging depot and repeat a few times until you beast the map. This game is mediocre at best. Definently not worth $30, more like $5.  "

												The first half hour spent with the game will be riddled with intensive cursing, then you will begin to feel that the differential lock should be on 90% of the time, and when even that wouldn't help, you still can turn on all-wheel driving which will pull you out from almost any situation. At least in casual mode. Anyway, be careful and approach larger bodies of water slowly, because they tend to be deep enough to stall the engine.The game is worth its price, the trucks behave realistically in the deep mud (at least for me, who never experienced deeper than my shoes), but I have to mention one thing: camera handling. That's plain terrible. It's sliding from one side of the truck to the other, and you bet that the truck itself will cover half of your monitor any given time, and you can't see where you are going. But don't let that keep away from this title.			"

												The game was alright, a pretty good trucking simulator up until today:There was a dispute amongst the devs and one of them inserted malicious code into the game out of spite. Now, when any user launches the game after February 2016 it will automatically crash after a few seconds. The game is quite literally unplayable and anyone who paid money for it has been utterly robbed. I hope anybody who reads this review will google ""spintires time bomb"" and see that I am telling the truth; the game no longer functions at all.  If you were planning to buy it based on the relatively high review score (86% at the time of writing), you are better off just throwing your money in the trash.			"

												The Mud is amazing, not even joking it's awesome, the file size is tiny and the game runs well but it's still nothing more than a tech demo for the engine. If you could grab it for $5 i'd recommend it but for S30 i think you'll struggle to get your moneys worth.  If they add a campagin and a better multiplayer system it could end up being worthwhile.

												I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the full release. Unless, of course this is still in open beta. It's hard to tell. I have played the tech demo, it was great, but having paid $30 here on Steam, and realizing that nowhere on Steam does it say this game is still under development, I'm wondering why there isn't a larger difference between the demo and the game. Other than equipment add-ons, I can't see a huge difference. Don't get me wrong, the physics are amazing, the terrain simulation superb (though there's WAY too much mud. I haven't found a single road yet that I didn't sink into, so I drive pretty much everywhere off-road). I've only played about 5 hours so far, so I can't say I've seen everything, but I was hoping to be a little more wowed for the money.Hopefully it's still in development.			"

												EDIT - 06/03/2017: Still no word from the devs on ANY updates or patches AT ALL for over a year now. It has almost certainly been abandoned with dozens of major issues still rampant. I would stay away if I were you.Below is my original review of this game, which was negative to begin with:THE BAD:First of all there have been no significant updates to this game in MONTHS, last few updates added a couple of new trailers and maybe one or two new trucks, while completely ignoring major issues with the game, like not being able to save your multiplayer game, save deletions, crashes and very bad stability in a lot of user's sistems. AND LETS NOT FORGET THE OFFICIAL MOD SUPPORT UPDATE PROMISED QUITE SOME TIME AGO.Second, game gets boring after 10 hours due to lack of any other objective other than ""Get logs from here to here"". It also suffers from an over-sensitive damage sistem, example: touch a tiny rock with the bottom of your truck at 5mph, get 24 damage (this is bad when most veicules have a max of 500hp and there are tiny rocks EVERYWHERE) and when it's not the tiny rocks it's the small twigs that get you.THE GOOD:Decent graphics and amazing physics make this game very realistic in terms of mud behaviour (most of the time at least), for example: if you only take the same route over and over the terrain is gonna get harder and harder to move in due to the mud getting boggier and boggier.Soviet era trucks and military offroaders, what's not to love.Good level design.Fuel consuption sistem makes it a lot more realistic.You can knock down (some) trees. VEREDICT:I've had this game since a month or two after it came out on early access, my play time for such a timespan should give you a hint as to the replayability and capacity to keep you engaged that it has. (granted driving around in the mud, getting stuck from time to time, has it's charm, it's not, however, enough of a foundation to base a game upon, as far as I'm concerned, AND I REALLY LOVE OFFROADING).That being said I really hope the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ together because this game has potential, especially with no other half-decent offroaders out right now. I just cant recomend it in it's current state, especially not at it's full price.			"

The only new vehicles come from the community and the level editor seems to just be a carrot on the end of a stick.

												For those who are not that affictioned by Trucks and offroad experiences(like me) id say this game can offer some well-spend hours of gameplay.I find playing with other people completely necessary, the reason beeing, is that you often get stuck in mud, run out of fuel, or you simply damage your vehicle way too much for it to ride. And the only thing you can do in any of those situations, is either to ask for help, or respawn in the nearest base.Pros:-Fancy graphics, good amount of detail-Easy controls, noob friendly-Deformable terrain, water effects are extremelly well done-Sound effects are good-Variety of vehicles to driveCons:-In multiplayer, it's hard to find a lobby that doesn't lag-Gets boring after a few hours(it's basicly the same thing, over and over again)-Just 1 objective at the moment, which is, to gather logs and to unload them in the unloading zone.-The map is really big, and riding those big, slow trucks gets boring, specially when alone-Even tho the map is deformable, I think they exaggerated on the terrain. When i started, it was literally impossible to go further then 5 meters. The whole map is basicly offroad, and there is little to no roads in it. -Maps all look the same, terrain is repetitive , and with no details(asides from the trees, grass, water, rocks and sand. No houses/aesthetic feeling)This was my honest review on the game. In the hours that i put in this game, i managed to find 3 friendly people that stayed in the server the whole time. I experienced little to no lag(mainly because i was hosting it) . We completed all the tasks. We explored the whole map, and thats basicly it.TL;DR- It's a good game to kill time, but not the type of game to invest hours upon hours in it. In the state it is, id call it a 7/10.			"

The physics are impressive and accurate. Watching the mud fly, the tires spin, and the look and feel and experience make this a blast. Lots of community downloads if you want more cool maps and 4 wheel drive vehicles you would never be able to afford.I used to have a 1997 Jeep Wrangler Sport. This brought back a lot of memories.

												20 hours done. First impressions.Firstly, I am an experienced 4x4 driver of almost 40 years. I lived and worked in some of the harshest conditions Australia has to offer so I came at this from a fairly high level of knowledge. My experience includes HV rescue.(In this, I'll use the term 4x4 to include the 6 and 8 wheel drives in game for brevity)GRAPHICSReally nice. Modelling is great. My 670gtx on maximum settings sits easily on 60fps with no heat issues.SOUNDSome of the trucks sound great, particularly the turbo diesel variant of the C series. It is very loopy however and more often than not a truck on constant acceleration going through a bog sounds like a 500hp Caterpillar with the Jake Brake operating as it shifts down - through every damn gear. It's more akin to a 60t semi-trailer coming down from highway speed at an intersection. (I know, I hear them everynight where I live).  Scene ambience (if you shut down the engine to hear it) is quite nice to listen to.VEHICLESIn my first playthrough, finding all the different vehicles was a buzz. From a little 4WD to 8 wheel drive behemoths. Unfortunatley, once you have the 8 wheelers, pretty well every other truck becomes redundant in casual mode and I ended up just putting a load on 2 trucks, hooking up a tow and completing the objectives towing the second vehicle behind me regardless of terrain with the older 8WD.CONTROLSGame controls can be confusing. Clearly the game was created for XBox controller and instead of providing for additional PC keybinding, a second level key must be turned on then off to use a combined feature. EG: Turn on V to get winch, connect winch points. I can winch using F but if I want to drive and pull with winch I need to press V again to disable additional  menu.EG: Gear changes in hardcore. I have to press R, then select gear via a silly graphic. Why not keybinds? A VERY common ""debogging"" technique is vehicle rocking. (forward <> backwards motion). This is impossible because of this.CAMERAOMG!! Whatever happened to simple rotation on the object with mouse wheel or even button zoom? Again, it feels like this was designed for dual stick controllers and NOT for PC users. Aside from no cabin view, I'm stuck looking down the side of the vehicle to drive. I can press 1 or 2 to change view direction but that's it. Sure, I can click the screen and rotate and zoom in by pushing the mouse forward, right up until an object (eg: a tree) grabs the FOV and changes it. More than once I had a FFS moment trying to work out where to drive to when there were trees close to me etc. Even a flat overhead view would make this sooooo much better. PHYSICSThe excellence in the mud physics and 4WD capabilities of the vehicles in it is sublime. To watch difflock in operation by placing one side of the vehicle on hard ground is awesome. The ""catching"" you experience with traction pulling on one side is pretty close to authentic.  Climbing out of bogs where front wheels gain traction (or rear in reverse) is right on the money.TERRAINPersistent in SP and this really makes it interesting. I found myself (largely from RL experience) really making an effort not to chew the tracks up too much. Using some track areas repeatedly eventually required winching/towing to get out where previously I could drive straight through. Some of the rocks in this game are stupidly big and unrealistic and have been placed quite stupidly (add to the challenge?) in some places such as around entrance roads etc. Including tree placement!CLOAKING (FOW)Trite, simplistic and very poorly done. (dev skills shortfall?). Large black circles requiring driving blind to the middle to unlock an area. Nothing progressive and no reward for doing recon in vast areas until you actually get to the little ""cloak vortexes"".  An incremental decloak would be soooo much better here or just remove it. It's stupid.WINCHESOh my. Forget chaining up vehicles or doing long snatches out of bogs here. Tiny little cables, no extensions and single winch points. Supposedly it adds to the challenge (that's what they said) but it's so far removed from reality it turns what COULD have been really good fun into a trite -if not frustrating- exercise. The short winches just make driving to the sides of tracks a neccessity and no amount of skilfull driving such as best line is allowed. Recovery out of a long bog or river is as good as impossible and the option is to.... rescue to garage (in casual mode).(I've done rescues at over 150m with triple cabled/chained 4x4's to get semi-trailers out of mud bogs and snatches out of sand dunes with winch extensions - STANDARD FARE in the world of 4WD. Recovery vehicle is ALWAYS hard grounded otherwise it's pointless trying. Duh.)OVERALLA good, fun and casual game with the usual ""skill"" achievements to unlock, some requiring MP mode to complete (WHY?!)The actual driving makes an excellent 4WD simulator but so much of it is extremely arcade in play and really makes a mess of what could have been... brilliant. Too much emphasis on controller and so much of it requires MP to make use of the vehicles in game. Fun as SP but *not* designed specifically for it or around it.""Casual"" is too easy with magic carpet rides to the garage instead of just giving decent recovery tools (which would negate the need for magic carpet rides). ""Hardcore"" is  removal of the magic carpet and a stupid difflock on/off system tied to which transmission (M or A) you use!!If the camera is ever fixed - and I mean FIXED - the BS they call cloaking is changed/removed and decent winches to make all vehicles much more important (remove the magic carpet ffs),  this would easily get a 9.As it stands, I give it a solid 7.5. (buy it on special if you can)CONCLUSION: If you have 360 controller and don't know what ""off-road"" is really like, might be a good buy for the fun factor. Don't buy it if you're looking for accuracy as an off-road simulation - it'll fail you. PS: No wheel support guys. A driving sim...... Yep. I know. Apparently it's planned.			"

												So bought the game simply because they said they were going to implement the workshop. And we thought lets give them the benefit of the doubt. They took forever to implement it, and then the best part was they changed all the code we liked to ""simple"" code example the friction was a value now they changed it to preset terms offroad being the most but not nearly as much grippy as some trucks had. And in the beginnin we could only download six truck they made for the first month because they didn't release the tool. ""Combine Tools"" it was leaked ages before and it seemed to fine but they said no it has to be ""perfect"". And it got released and was usable with a guide, that honstly doesn't show much the forums are much better. But the whole point of the tool was for making maps and they were so nice not to include it, so we were still stuck using the old leaked version with some nice conversion tools made by some very clever people. The worst part is they didn't even allow people to post their maps on the forums made with the leaked tool. Skip another month or two finaly we get the map editor in the tool but what we can't upload maps to the workshop the biggest BS ever, since steam or their code does weird stuff to mods so we have to upload to websites and forums. We're allowed to now because it is the ""offical released tool"" that looks and works the same as the leaked one with a few added features for the guides.Then came the timebomb bug that blocked launching the game. Luckly someone created a patch for it on the forums and we could play on. There was said in april 2016 we would get new features and content, it's December 2016 and not a single word from them. But they can go f them selfs the community is strong and I highly recommend Spintires + addon if you want to enjoy the game.			"

												I know this game got some bad reviews, but don't let that stop you from getting it.  I highly enjoyed myself playing it.  I was impressed how great the graphics are.  The game has a realistic feel in that the mud ruts will actually get deeper the more you drive through the same spot....thought that was really cool that the terrain changes depending on your play.  It is an off road sim...nothing else.  I enjoyed getting different trucks stuck (sometimes multiple) and coming up with ways to get them out.  Driving in the woods at night is a realistic challange!  The game runs smooth, no hang-ups or freezes.  The only fault I have is you can't play between different maps and keep you saved games....meaning you have to complete one map at a time in order to keep your saves...a small gripe!			"

												After playing the game for around 20 hours, I like Spintires but it could be more. After 3-5 hours of playing the game, I started to wish Spintires was a road construction game. Delivering logs could have been more of a plot point. Some logging company sets up shop, they need to set up a decent road network before logs can be moved. They hire you to build the roads. You go from area to area picking up materials and dropping them off where the road construction is. You drive various vehicles and construction equipment to mark the routes, flatten the ground, and remove rocks. Once the road is done, the logging company is able to move logs and you win. You can either deliever logs on your fancy road and enjoy your work, or move on to the next map.I'm still going to recommend this game, but only to gamers who enjoy choose your own adventure games. What you do and how much fun you have is pretty much up to you. Its a fun game and definitely a techical achievement, but it could have been more. It feels like this is a tech demo with a sprinkle of game added to it. Hopefully the devs land a nice contract for a new game using this tech.			"

												Spintires - an all-terrain off-road simulator - has great potential and it is always nice to see an indie developer making something different, something exciting. While not many maps and vehicles are available the already existing ones give you enough challenge to spend dozens of hours with the game.The concept of Spintires is very simple: every map has a location for the lumber you need to deliver elsewhere. This location along with the drop-off point is shown on your map. They are, of course, quite far from each other (usually positioned at opposite ends of the map. The terrain is usually difficult to navigate on so you need to carefully plan where you'd like to go and which vehicle you'd like to take. Additionally, the game does not reveal the map for you - certain ""cloaking"" areas are placed and in order to get rid of them you need to approach their epicenter.Navigation requires you to pay attention. Naturally, the best is to play with a friend as in coop mode you can not only deliver more lumber at once but help each other if stuck in the mud.  Respawning is possible but only in casual mode: real challenge begins only for hardcore gamers! Near garages certain extensions can be installed - utility assets are available for repair work and you can install a tank for the fuel to have long-lasting petrol available.I like the complexity of the game and having translations in many languages is always a plus for me. The game looks nice - especially the water and mud effects look great during interactions with your vehicles. The only downside is the missing sound effects for your friend - you simply do not hear the engine of their car but only your own. And you cannot see their tracks in the mud which would be nice if you go on separate ways only to meet up later on because of the objective.Overall, I am really satisfied with this game. It has potential and while rumor has it the relationship between publisher and developer is not exactly great with regular updates this game can be even greater!			"

												Probably the most realistic Mud Bogging game we will see for quite some time. It's a simulator so it's debatable if the game is ""fun"" as there's not a whole lot to doBut you do get a great since of joy when plowing through deep trenches of mud, crossing rivers, and using your wrinch cable to get you out when you get stuck.  It's also very player-driven since you have a LOT of choices and paths to choose from.   Do you go straight through the creek, or go through the woods?It's also a bit challenging considering you can't be in all-wheel drive without burning up all your gas, so you have to be cautious. A few positive notes:+ Multiplayer Co-Op support (I REALLY wish i had friends who played this)+ WORKSHOP SUPPORT JUST ADDED I can't wait to see all the new vehicles people make+ Mod Community + Less than 700MB in Size (pretty remarkable these days) Negatives:- Camera Angles are pretty awkward- Poor first person view- No player character (would be nice if you could walk around and get in your vehical manually)- Takes too long to get anything accomplished... you'll be lucky to complete 1 objectiveOverall it's a great simulator, I just wish there was more gameplay to be had, could you imagine if this was a racing or hunting survival game? xD Lots of potential(Side Note) I do hope to see an ATV being added in the workshop soon, would be a GREAT addition, could use it to transport fuel or deliver packages.

I'd buy it for 7-10 euros for sure if you can get it around that mark.I recomend this game as CO-OP, normal singleplayer didnt intrest me personally as much of the comedy and enjoyment comes from the dynamic situations and helping eachother get their trucks off the mud, water, trees , everywhere :DIf you can get it for under 10€ from some sale, It is worth it. Spend the remaining 15€ for some alcohol and get your co-op workcrew to a real russian trucker state ^^			"

												Whats not to like about spin tires? I first played this game as what i remember a demo. My memory tells me it was a beta/demo/look at how cool our mud and tires are kind of thing.amazing game. insanely fun and really gets the imagination going. Plotting out your next turn 100 feet in advance, am i going too fast?, wondering what side of the trail you should be on, what gear to be in, I might be going too fast!, watching the mud churn and the tires deform, SLOW DOWN!!!!, locking in 4 and playing with the diff.... the whole time you are doing maybe 10mph tops...its easy too get get mentally lost in this game and forget to do the laundry or dishes.

												Reasons why I bought this game:- I bought this game  because I genuinely want to play it.  - If you liked to play with toy cars in the dirt when you were a kid then you'll probably like this.- It's a more meditative type of driving game. Being attentive, methodical and patient are key to  navigating through the game- Most important thing that I liked about this game is the fancy mud and overall physics.- In addition, It wowed me with the crystal clear graphics, bright colors, ... drive into the wilderness, and   the beautiful scenery			"

												Okay so a review on the game so far.Baring in mind I played the Tech Demo for a few hours before this game officially became released.The graphics are really really nice, really they offer some nice features and good design.The audio is just basic engine sounds with other crane noises etc... You cannot hear the other players vehicles etc. (Release version might be patched by now)The controls... there is where it gets a little tricky.  The controls are awkward to get used too and even when you are, you spend most time reading back over them.  It is what I do.The game itself has is a great one and not to be played alone.  Multiplayer with 4 friends is the best, really.If you enjoy slow 4x4 changing to find the best possible route to an objective with too much water or mud infront of you.. You then work a way around it slow on the power in a low or high gear, then get stuck and winch out or a friend winchs you out, and then you get stuck and use a crane to frog it.Really the game is really good fun taking a slower pace to a driving simulator.  IT IS A SIMULATOR I swear.  It is really hard to get used too and you drive slow with friends.It is realistic water terroforming, realistic terrain deforming and realisitic placement of everything, really a well made game and not to be taken as ""yeah I am great at racing games"" I am great at racing games and this is not a race!You put tooooo much power on the wheels on the terrain you will become stuck because the tires dug into the terrain causing a hole... Amazing!Driving slow, enjoying the beautiful scenary.  Yes the game has some problems like random damage loss, random rock and getting stuck really easy, but you ignore them because it fun, driving, driving, stuck.. Winch out, driving driving, stuck, friend winchs you out, driving and reach destination... You fail to read and go respawn at garage, update your vehicle and then make the journey all over again, getting stuck, winching, driving, winching etc.. Read the mission you and a friend, you get logs for example and start to drive out but now you are top heavy with a heavier truck, you get a decent distance outside turn in mud and go FULLL POWERRRR... Then the truck tips over, your friends laugh and you smile because you enjoyed it and made a silly move... Now repeat.Really this is a great slow moving tactical approach to driving offroad game.  Looking forwward to future content and releases!I am happy I brought this game and happy I have so much fun, if you enjoy 4x4 then this is a great game!			"

												The last update fixed a lot of things for me. It's possible to drive across a river again or through a deep mud pit. I'm not sure if this has been fixed for everybody (not a whole lot of people had these bugs in the first place) but I'm glad it's working here.There seems to be some conflict between dev and publisher again. They can't seem to get the dev to fix certain things and the dev tells people he doesn't know about bugs that the publisher alledgedly did tell him about. All very strange.Original review below might be outdated, but I can say this...The trucks and mud physics are great, but the User Interface is awkward and feels incomplete. No rebinding of keys for 360 controllers and no return-to-center for steeringwheel either, but non-360 controllers don't get all keybinds for some reason and you can't rebind the Gear Shifter and camera controls.Would I recommend it? I want to vote neutral. I kinda like it, but the quirks can also be royally frustrating. And I'm not sure if I would support (all of) the people behind this game. If you want a well polished product skip this, if you don't care about that this is a pretty good game.-----Original review:Typical Early Access game. I know it's just out of Early Access, but if it were up to any respectable company it would just now get into Beta.Before I tell you what's all wrong with it I'll tell you how (and if) it redeems itself. If you ask me... No, for most people the problems are way to big if it even runs, but as an offroad enthusiast this is the only interesting game out there that doesn't feel like a racing game with 30% less grip. The trucks (well 3 out of 7), suspensions and mud physics are all pretty amazing! You can actually dig yourself in if you give it too much power for instance.However... These are the problems you'll have to learn to live with if you want this game:- The camera! It's impossible to get it to go where you want it to go, so exploring the wilderniss or getting out of a dense forest is nearly impossible while with a good camera it would be very easy.- If you use a gamepad other then a 360 controller you can't use the stickshifter. This was not pointed out before purchase. You also can't adjust the camera properly. It's just as bad as with the mouse but 5 times slower.- If you use a controller of any kind you still need the keyboard regularly which is awkard. It's understandable that some things need a mouse, but the keys on the keyboard are absolutely unnecessary if they just made the option to bind them as you wish.- The game was absolutely broken for 80% of customers for over a week, but it works now for 98% of people.- 98% of people don't register to the OOVEE forums. Those people report massive amounts of bugs which will never be adressed, because 'That's their problem.'- Lag in online games is usually enormous. But the Client determins how your truck drives, so 90% of the time it's not a huge problem.- The winch, that you'll need a lot, is super glitchy. It can randomly flip a vehicle that you're towing. Usually works well enough though.*- The winch cable is super short.- They just removed some winch points- No high winch points, so you can't keep it stable on a banked road- Winch power is sometimes humongous, sometimes you don't even know you're winching- You can only attach to a max amount of trees. This can mean that the 1 tree you need is unavailable.In my own experience this max amount randomly varies from 5 to 15.- The DRM is very agressive and when you lose the connection with the notoriously instable server your game is closed. You will save SP progress but MP progress will be gone. I have not been able to play for longer then 20 minutes and it takes hours to complete a map.**- You can barely drive over small branches. Yes. You can haul lumber, but some vehicles can't get over branches as they have no friction. Wow.***- You can't see how to wade through water, because you can't see the bottom. So it's just driving in the river a thousand times and crossing your fingers that you don't need to do 3 hours of progress all over again. It´s realistic, but there should be a way to check like you could in real life with a stick.- Unrealistic game-balance measures. For instance if you drive in a straight line on a hard road (also happens on soft roads sometimes) you get damage if you leave Diff-lock enabled. And you stall if you don't switch to second gear fast enough while in real life it could drive away in highest gear while carrying a load. I'm afraid they'll add more of these things as the current publishers don't care about realism.And then there's the Publisher OOVEE. There's a lot of speculation about wether they are respectable or not, all I know for sure is that they don't seem to care about all the aformentioned problems. They only read what's posted on their own forum where maybe 1-2% of customers go and ignore all problems on the Steam forums. They also don't post changelogs there and every update breaks the game for a big portion of the people. They don't tell them how to do a clean install and how to fix the game, so many people just stop playing. This way they choose not to know what problems this game has. Very lazy to say the least. I once complained about the camera control with the gamepad and they sent me a tutorial on how to fix it myself in by programming in Python. They sell a game that's nearly broken and they send us duct tape.There's a chance that they'll (I mean their single Russian developer) fix some problems soon, but since they don't know about many problems, I don't expect most problems to ever be fixed. They did say that they were looking into the problem with the branches.Publishers just told me days ago that they think the game is done. ish. But it will get some minor improvements and tweaks.* This has now been fixed. Pretty much.** DRM isn't causing problems for me anymore, but there are some players who still can't play online.*** This has gotten worse as they completely overhauled the physics. Mud is now softer and Branches don't sink in the mud. So you got a branch you absolutely can't pass except by pushing it out the way if the end of the stick doesn't get caught. If it does it's tough luck.			"

												Personal Rating: Do not support these people.Classic Rating: ★★★☆☆Spintires is not worth your money, even if it ""is/might be"" a good game.After that sick incident between developer and publishers which only made customers pay, we've been waiting on a false hope spread by Oovee since 23 APRIL, 2016:Originally posted by Zane Saxton, and everyone from Oovee:If you are not a fan of consoles, do not fear - it is also good news for our PC fans since it now means we will be expanding the development team for that platform as well! It may have taken us some time to secure and announce such a deal but work has already commenced and in the next few months you will hear more details about the ports and additional updates for the PC platform too.
SourceSo, there was no further update and we still don't have maps support in the Workshop.Gameplay wise, Spintires is still fun and enjoyable even if there are some bad cons there too:One and for all, the camera is atrocious, either while driving and so while in advanced mode to attach winches - it's not something I can explain, you'd have to see it for yourself. Also I'm not talking about the lack of a ""Cabin"" camera mode, I'm talking about not being able to see what you're doing and where you're going with ease.At the end of the story I'm ""yet another disappointed gamer"" who'd like to play this unique game, sink a lot of hours in it, see it grow and improve. I'm also quite sure that won't happen, sadly.			"

												Do NOT buy this game! This game has a so called Time-Bomb in it, you cannot play this game anymore because is is coded to crash after a certain date, which has passed. The developers and publishers are blaming each other for problems around the game.This game is not gonna run properly without fixing it yourself, you've got to Google it, someone made a fix. Look into that before buying this broken game which is probably never going to be fixed.			"

												This is a driving / offroad fan's dream game. Ten year old me would have been easily banned from the computer for playing too much while the adult in me has to remind myself I have work in the morning.Spintires is an offroad open sandbox game complete with 5 maps and about 7-8 different trucks. Now, the idea of it being sandbox may throw some off - but oddly enough there is enough going in this game to keep you busy. The game concept follows around objectives and the process of driving up to garage's and trucks to unlock them. Some (or most) objectives require you to transport certain materials such as lumber. Not all trucks can carry lumber and not all trucks have the attachments to. When starting off at your main garage, players can modify their vehicles by adding utility carts, lights or such other accessories. The trucks that are put into this game are pretty cool and quite dynamic. Some are stuck without all wheel drive while some have differential locks as well as all wheel drive. Trucks can be as small as a jeep, to as big as a heavy crane truck you would see helping unload construction material near a job site. Some trucks even come with cranes to load and unload lumber! There is, however a draw-back to this awesome inclusion. Typically, you load up your lumber automatically and only if you happen to get into an accident or logs fall out, then you can use your crane to load them up. So the crane does have a use, but can also be seen as useless to some. The driving experience itself is addicting. I'm not sure why, and I'm not sure how, but the challenge of ripping through dirt road, water, mud, even rolling over sticks or the occasional rock is amusing. Adding a cart to the back of the truck also makes the challenge that much harder as it's not only the truck you have to get across the river. The driving itself seems quite realistic to me. I have also seen a lot of reviews saying it is ridiculous how some trucks have the hardest time going over rocks or even loose tree branches. Although it can be the case, typically the trucks shouldn't have too much of an issue going over the obstacles. Tree branches aren't too bad but the rocks will definitely set you back. I wish there was a bit more freedom within this realm to go over obstacles, but going through trees that haven't matured quite yet is pretty fun (disclaimer : I don't ride my Toyota through any tree, shrub or the sort. I love mother nature).  Sometimes where the is no path, a path can be made with a heavy truck pushing small trees aside. Most collisions feel right except one little thing that bugs me, why can't I drive into an exploding barrel that was put on the map? I know it's kind of silly to have such a thing next to a lumber yard, but why put it there if I can't ""use"" or hit it? The game has weird moments like this where it chooses to clip instead of let you collide. What I absolutely do love about this game is the winch. When I first started, I was extremely frightened to go at it alone as I would end up on my side or get stuck. I started learning how to use the winch efficiently and my experience with the game got a lot better. I'm glad I chose to play multiplayer first in lieu of single player. The community was a worldly and friendly one. Multiplayer WILL NOT save your  progress but single player WILL. Graphics are quite nominal especially when it comes to the mud and water. Trees are there but I think could have been done a bit better. Back drops are nice, would have been nicer with some mountains or something else to fill some gaps. The game also features a night and day scheme. The sounds are actually on point, and when your vehicle is physically damaged, damaged sounds also follow. I like this game, it could have been better with a bit more variation and a few more construction touches (crane's and the like... maybe even dirt diggers), none the less, pretty good game to some, decent for others. I would love to see more map additions and truck additions, and a little variations on objectives.I have yet to try the mods but when I do, I will update the review. I got this game for $10 and would say it's worth it. $30 may be slightly over stretching it for a few.

												I have 87.4 hours on record, so I can safely say the game is fun.+ physics are good+ i like the art style of the game + old soviet trucks!- buggy - lack of content (after 80 hours of gameplay)The game is way more fun in multiplayer, especially if you have friends who play the game.

												From Russia with log! Well, this is my first game review on Steam, not because this is the first time I've used Steam and not because this is the first game I've played but because this is the first game I've bought that has genuinely surprised me! I saw this in the store, it looked mildly interesting...it ticked a few boxes and looked aesthetically pleasing, then I booted it up! A bit of a learning curve at first but once I got the hang of it I was having a blast!! Blasting though mud (WHICH HAS SIMULATED DEFORMATION AS DOES THE TYRES!!!!) Manually loading logs and then hot tailing it to the objective with a buddy following me just incase I need winching out of a sticky situation. We've only put 10 hours in so far but I assure you there's many MANY more hours going to be put in! I look forward to contiued updates and support from the Dev, this game is quite possibly my top game of 2015!! If YOU like the look of it, take the plunge!			"

												It's a relaxing game compared to the average game, but not because it's boring. There is a lot of judging the road ahead, trying to spot the areas to avoid so you don't ditch or spill the load, winching yourself out of mud and holes, winching another truck out, examining the map, etc, etc. You have to be relaxed or you will just get nowhere.The best part for me is just how immersive it all is. The truck models are top notch, the environment is thick and rich, and the way the mud squishes and deepens and exposes boulders is something I've never seen before... very realistic. And the physics and vehicle behavior all feel right; I mean, considering it's a video game. When it's night and you're alone on some muck-filled, forest path with crickets chirring and you're unsure where you might be, the sound of your mighty diesel is a very welcome thing.It takes a little while to get used to the game; especially the camera. Until you get used to that and a few other game controls, it's aggravating. I am glad I didn't give up on it and have been very happy with Spin Tires.			"

												So let me start off by saying this is one of the most impressive games I have played in a long time. From it's Terrain deformation, to it's beautiful graphics engine, right down to the vehicles themselves this game was masterfully designed in my opinion. Which makes this review that much more difficult to write. If the game was a travesty then it would be easy enough to just click the don't recommend button, but the game is even in its ""unfinished"" state very playable and very enjoyable.The game released a little while back, it went from a beta to Full Release status which at the time felt pretty rushed but with promises of continued updates making that look a little bit more palatable, Unfortunately updates have stopped coming.As of the time of writing this it’s been around 2 months since the last official announcement from the developer team, and a month before that.The community outlook for this game is pretty grim as well if you would like some examples of what the hub of a “dead game” looks like 3 good examples come to mind, Minerwars, Starforge  and Spintires.  The T.L.D.R of this review is, the game seems to have gotten stale as the developers have went from infrequent updates to just not releasing updates. I DO NOT recommend this game. "

												  This game is amazing, now let me tell you why. It sounds like a simple game, drive large (and some small) foreign trucks around a mud-filled map and pick up and deliver logs. Sounds easy? You'll find doing these tasks is actually rather challenging. The maps are designed around uncovering and planning the best route to take in order to get the job done. Sometimes you'll be faced with crossing huge rivers, rock filled mudpits, other times you'll be treated to plain old ashphalt.   Strategizing and planning is part of the fun, and the rest comes from the amazingly trim and well optimized engine. The game, at release, is a whopping 595MB!  The particle, smoke and terrain deformation effects are all very well done and are a treat to look at. The maps are gorgeous, you will find yourself immediatley immersed in them. The sounds of rushing river water, chirping birds, crackling trees as you plow through them all add to make this game as realistic as possible.  The camera takes getting used to as it does control differently than anything else I have ever used. Once you do learn how it works, you'll find it irreplaceable. No need for 1st person cameras here. This is not a game of speed, but a game of strategy. You need to be able to see all sides of your vehicle, sometimes all at once in order to make it through trecherous terrain. I have read that the developers are thinking about adding in a cockpit view camera. I can almost assure you I will not use it. It would have almost no function in this game, and once you play, you will see what I mean.   This game has been a while in the making and I am glad its finally here. Planned future mod support and DLC from the developers will give this game a long life. I, for one will be there along the way.			"

												When I first heard about this game, I read a lot of reviews saying that this game is both challenging, fun and relaxing.What a combination I thought, for a game with such a simple premise. Drive big russian trucks through hazardous environments to collect lumber, and deliver it to locations on the map. The game looks gorgeous, but I had to try it before I considered buying it. I went to the Spintires website and downloaded the tech demo.I can easily say that I played the demo for more than 10 hours play time. And there weren't even any objectives in the demo. JUST DRIVING. The act of driving a large vehicle through mud, water and any other terrain the game had was fun enough. The terrain deforms in real time as the tires cut through it, this is a simulation game like no other. EVERY FACTOR MATTERS, the weight, which tires are spinning and making contact, are the tires wet? How heavy is the vehicle itself? How much is the force of the river pushing you off the road? How big is the tree you're making contact with and can you knock it over?Seriously, this game is just an early access game and already it has so much going for it.I bought the game and already after the amount of hours I've played it (at the time of this review (6 hours) I have yet to see the entire first map I've played and I haven't completed one objective yet (because I'm still enduring all that nature and it's mud can throw at me and my trucks).This game is zen, it is a challenging and VERY rewarding experience for those who persist and overcome the obstacles in it. For those who look at this game and wonder, ""But it's just driving through mud and getting stuck in it."" No, it's about getting out of the mud. Just go download the tech demo now to see if it's for you.UPDATE: So I finally played multiplayer.It's great! It was fun enough to just play with one other person, so I'm sure it's great with more. I cleared all cloaks and assisted the other player while they hauled loads of lumber. It's a great co op experience. But you know what this needs? Team VS matches. Also, time trials. That would up the ante.Got disconnected at one point when I FINALLY got to the other player to unflip their vehicle. hahaGREAT GAME PURCHASE IT NOW 10/10 And it's only getting better from here!			"

												While the concept of Spintires is great (and I truely do love the idea), I cannot see how this game can be considered finished. The camera control is unusable, trailers have a habit of disappearing, and the map feature is near useless.The camera does not have dedicated pan and tilt. Instead, you have a hotkey to 'focus' on the truck, and a similar key to focus on the trailer. To view 'first person' camera, you click on a transparent camera where the driver sits. There is no hotkey for this. If you click anywhere that isn't on a menu item or winch point or similar, the game toggles into or out of camera control, rather than only while you hold down the button. You'll be accidentally switching into camera control mode rather often when you meant to release a winch or click on a menu item.Trailers may disappear until a game restart if you change the bed of your truck at a garage. I do not know of a way to make them re-appear without a game restart. Similarly, if you disconnect your trailer because it got stuck, I cannot figure out how to re-attach it; even when directly on top of the hitch, it constantly states I am too far away.The map starts out nearly completely black for each map. The concept is that as you drive around, the map slowly reveals areas you've been to. However, the area that is revealed is smaller than what you can already see. As you travel down a road and spot a side-road heading off of it, the map doesn't reveal enough that you can see that side-road. While this doesn't seem like an issue, it's annoying when you're trying to turn around onto such a road and you can't see where it is because of the aforementioned camera issues. Maps therefore become a complete guessing and memorizing game, which while more realistic, doesn't actually do what a map should. Oh, and there's no minimap, so you'll be starting and stopping a lot.All this being said, the concept of the game is great. It's a ton of fun when you get a giant truck through some deep mud or a river that you thought would be impossible to cross. Given a bit more work on the camera and map (as well as bugfixes such as with trailers), I can see myself playing this quite often. However, seeing the age of the game and that these basic things are in such a state, I can't say I'm too hopeful that it will ever reach its potential.			"

												Spintires isn't for everybody and its not perfect. Lets get the problems out of the way straight off the bat.1. No fixed camera, no interior camera, fairly poor camera placement and controls.2. Not a whole lot to do in the game.3. Some bugs and in some ways feels like an early access title.Now onto the good.1. Fairly realistic fluid displacement engine, you create tracks in the mud and if you're not careful you will find yourself bogged very fast.2. Co-op multiplayer, its always fun playing with friends.3. Nice graphics engine and Truck models. While it isn't the best game graphically, everything comes together well, the game runs great and looks nice in most parts, the Truck models are top notch though.4. Several different trucks with different attachments. This means you and your friends can set yourself up with the perfect trucks for any given situation and actually use teamwork.5. A winch system! You can winch yourself and friends out when they are bogged, you can winch yourself to a tree to pull yourself out if no one is around to help, lots of fun and very cool.I could write far more about this game, but if the idea of 4WDing around several big open world maps is appealing, just take the plunge and make the purchase, you won't regret it. 9/10			"

												I can recommend Spintires to all simulation game and off-road fans who have the patience to play a game that is basically about delivering lumber from A to B and exploring the maps. The thing that makes this game special is the deformable mud and soil. Some say it is the best off-road simulator. I believe it is the only one out there (that is not about racing). You can still probably find the old demo for the game somewhere on the internet and see if you like it. The full game has more features than the demo.To many this is an unfinished game and it probably won't be finished but it is playable and enjoyable; however, it is not for everybody.There is also a multiplayer but you can't save you progress in multiplayer.Spintires has great mod support for trucks but lacks proper mod support for maps but there are ways to get modded maps into the game.The achievment system drove me on to finish every map in the game and I would say you need about 4-6 hours per map to get most of the achievments. Just be ready that you will fail at your several first attempts.Also wait for a sale or search for great offers on Humblebundle store or Indie Gala store.I can't believe I had not reviewed this game since it was my favorite game for a long time  "

												So far, for my off road gaming experiance with Spin Tires by Oovee is at the very top, #1. Being an extreme off road enthuist I have done lots of research looking for games that offer this type of driving adventure realism. But to this point I have found nothing that compares to Spin Tires. The user creations and modifications with maps and vehicles are fantastic. My thanks and appreciation goes out to all that create this added content, you are all awesome. I highly recommend this game as being the one to download and start your offroad adventuring with before all others.I would of course love to see some more modifications to the game in regards to terrian modification. Being able to actully use the cool user created diggers and graders, etc. to move trees, rocks and dirt would be awesome. To actually modify the terrain with the ploughs, diggers and dump trucks would be super. Perhaps in time :)Overall this offroad adventure game in my opinion is number 1, and I highly recommend to all that wish to but are not able to actually go extreme off roading to download and go for it.Thanks Again Oovee, and all the moddersHappy Wheeling "

In the maps you have multiple different types of terrains which some cars/trucks can handle but some can't. You can drive in water but it does increase your damage level. Pretty much all the maps are based in Russia and you can unlock multiple garages to store your trucks. Many people disliked this game at first due to its lack of updates but now the developers have seemingly come back to life and added about 5 more trucks/cars with loads of different mods.Now, onto the gameplay: Driving in this game is quite fun, you can do it with friends also. Driving through the mud is a tricky buisness, whilst driving through it your tires can dig into the mud, which makes the game a lot harder, but wheres the fun without difficulty right, RIGHT? There are unfortunatley only two camera angles for driving in this game (Main 3rd person camera and rooftop camera) but both are nice and you can have your own custom view settings which save when you exit the game?! And when you log back into your save, it carrys on from that exact location.Now: Objectives: There are multiple objectives in this game, such as a forestry delivery. In the forestry objective you have do deliver wood logs from one side of the map to the other. Also you can unlock garages by delivering ""garage points"" to them, every map has about 3 garages and when you quit the game saves your trucks there!So in conclusion a massive Russian map with true mud trucks, deliver logs, tow trucks and have a Russian swear at you when toggling diferential lock and all wheel drive. Just buy this game (Find it on the Steam Store £20, Bundle Stars Sales around £6,66, ♥♥♥ approx £3,75+) Prices may vary.			"

												So, this isn't a game that's going to be everyone's cup of tea. But, as someone who has driven large trucks for a living and spent a bit of time offroad (with said trucks), they've done a really good job of capturing the feel of those situations. And yes, somethings will feel a little ""wonky"" and off, but the Dev's seem like they're actively going to continue working on this title so I'm willing to overlook a few quirks. I'm also willing to overlook a few quirks because what they've created is spectacular. The sounds in this game are better than a lot of AAA developer titles, and its not like there's a lot going on to listen to. The excellent, and realistic, audio really helped draw me in. The visuals are slick, but its the phyiscs engine they've got this running on that really pulls it all together. Its simply fantastic. The terrain deformation, the suspension modeling, its all perfect. Like I said, I've driven large trucks offroad on many occasions for a job I used to have, and I've recoverd trucks from rouch spots (all two wheel drive, and non with locking diffs). Its a hard thing to pull off. And this game is hard. I mean, really, absurdly hard. I can attest that the handling is pretty on to what a truck like this would do, even at speeds. They've done a great job of recreating the real thing. The real thing is hard. This game. Is. Hard. I spent my first few hours attempting to explore and move loads, only to make one hair-line mistake in mis-judging an incline causing my truck to roll and dump its load, or not expecting a bit of water to be as deep as it drops off and suddenly flooding it hard. Its pretty much the real deal. So, if you don't want to just explore by yourself or get frustrated, than look elsewhere. You may also want to bring a friend along for the torture in multiplayer as you can really save each other from some literal rock-and-hard place spots. As for me, for now, I'll just be like Stanley and ""Begin the game again."" 10/10 Because Big Trucks			"

												Absolutely remarkable game.. Gorgeous.. Engrossing. Realistic, and addictive.I spent ONE HOUR getting myself out of a deep mud ditch stuck between two trees. One hour of real life time, and you know what? When I got out I felt like I accomplished something, like I had a good time.Few games capture that anymore, and this is one of them that does. It's probably the best game I have played in many years. If you are sick of the games on rails, the same old rehashed junk, and the feeling like you are just playing to 'get to the end', then this is your game. BUY IT.			"

												If you would have told me a off-road truck driving sim was goin to be one of the best games i have played this year i would have called you crazy!! But this game is just soo dam fun, the phisics of trying to pull a road trian throug a creek bed or driving a jeep into thick shrub looking for new trucks is amaazing. MP is also really awsome, setting up convoys, working together to winch people out a tight spot or deliver some fuel to the guy who ran out after exploing the far reaches of the map. Everyone should pick this up and experiance pushing a convoy of trucks the the harsh russian landskape!			"

Gorgeous graphics, wow-factor environmental effects and reactions. Having multiplayer on launchday was a great bonus and brings a lot to the game.

This game also doesn't handle rock crawling physics well and is horrible for anything over the speed of maybe 8mph. It's mostly getting stuck logging in the mud			"

Its so slow to get updated"" and i want to say different. This game is awsome!The physiscs engine was made by ONE MAN! And its one of the best driveing simulator engines around.Yes its not updated often but what do you expect its a small team that is makeing the game who are trying their best to get new stuff in the game in a perfected state.Soon there will be a new camera that will be better and steering weel support for those that complain that there is none.To end this i would like to say to those gits who dont realise how small the makers of this game are YOU ARE IDIOTS DO SOME RESARCH!I love this game and want to see it improve slowly but perfectly.I also wish the team good luck.

												Keep in mind, im not a fan of driving or racing games...You really feel like you are driving these vehicles and the muddy terrain feels really organic. The best muddy terrain physics I've ever seen...with that being said, you might think this game is mindless and dumb but its not. Think of it as a off-road physics puzzler where winching your buddies out of a hole is only half the fun. However, 2 major problems persist: The camera is bad when driving bigger vehicles AND Game progression doesn’t save during online play, which leaves no point in playing with friends as none of your unlocks will count towards anything but momentary entertainment. With a few tweaks, the gameplay experience could be very rewarding.			"

												I drove into the mud, got stuck, had no clue how to get unstuck, learned the controls, went exploring, discovered some very interesting trucks (some more useful than others ;) ). Here are things to do in Spintires:-spin your tires, alot-drive 18 wheelers loaded down with logs through dangerous muddy terrain-tug vehicles out of the mud with even bigger vehicles-Light exploration, or dangerous depending on how you approach, you get to decide-Attach different things to your truck to make it cool or even useful, such as but not limited to cranes and fuel tankers-play casually or in hardcore mode where there are no safety features, its you and a bunch of logs and mug that show no mercyA few downsides to the game:-gear shifting system and UI in general is just a little clunky, and I'm disappointed there is no simple manual gear shifting system. You pretty much have to have a special clutch and gearbox combo for that. You do have some control though, like +1 gear and a very fine tuned 1st and reverse gear.-camera system needs an overhaul-getting stuck can actually be really frustrating, but most of the time there IS a way to get out of it. -putting logs onto a trailer is really tricky and could use better explanationOther than that, I've had a lot of fun so far. Graphics and simulation of mud is just great in my opinion. Here's a little tip: If it looks dangerous, do it! "

												Great Game!Have the plains map completed and ive been plesantly surprised. A lot of the major critics example pcgamer gave this only 60/100 but its far better than that.It takes a bit of getting used to..attaching trailers etc and of course sorting your driving route through the siberian wasteland. The scenery and atmosphere is very authentic especcially at dusk trying to negotiate through the deep mud at sunset or dusk on to your objective.The handling of the trucks is life like and each truck has a different feel to it and the physics in the game have to be one of the best in a pcgame out there. The only real fault i have of the game is the camera, sometimes moving it around the truck just feels plain awkward and im hoping maybe a patch will be brought out one day to rectify this. I have only one map completed, but i took my time so there is plenty of hours in the game also there is a modding community to add more if you need be.			"

												What VERY LITTLE of a game that exists here is fun, but the developer and the publisher are scumbags. They do not care about their players at all, and overcharge for a game that currently is nothing more than two trucks with ten reskins, and a half dozen tiny maps that are just the same three different types of terrain repeated until you're sick of it.Mods are THE ONLY thing keeping this game fun, and the publishers are deliberately making it extremely hard to mod the game. They promised Workshop support a year ago, nothing.In fact, they promised more maps, more trucks, less glitches, and better gameplay over a year ago. Nothing. Actually, they removed a map, made three of the reskinned trucks worthless, and made the gameplay worse. They also added bugs and glitches, and refuse to fix them.Do not buy unless it's at least 75% off. This game is barely worth $10 as it stands. Also, don't expect to have much fun with friends, the multiplayer is nearly unplayable and there ARE NO SAVES. If anyone's internet even hiccups, you have to start over from the beginning.			"

												RECOMMENDED ON SALE ONLY, $30 IS FAR TOO PRICEY FOR THE CURRENT LACK OF UPDATES/CONTENT.That being said, this is a fantasticly fun, and relaxing game.  Its fun to drive through the Russian wilderness in large offroad vehicles and drive though the worst of road conditions.  I have put 16 hours into the game and still not attempted to complete an objective.  I thus far have simply explored the maps a bit, tried out different vehicles, and learned how to get my vehicles unstuck from different situations.Biggest complaint other than lack of content is as others have said, the camera system is ATROCIOUS. Part of the game is just fighting the camera, they need a cockpit view, and also a way to set the camera and leave it, instead of it flying around willy nilly.That is ALL there is to it, besides having a multiplayer component.  There are not even any snowy maps in the vanilla game, which is ludicrous considering its an offroading game taking place in Russia. Frankly this is one of those examples where a 2 year old game with little (but excellent!) content is being sold for $30.  Change the base price to $15 or even $20 and then hit it up with a sale, that seems much more appropriate IMO.  They have added workshop support, but I'd rather have a few more good maps added by the devs first before allowing the modding community to have at it.			"

												Almost exactly a year ago, when Philip Seymour Hoffman haven't yet died, defending New Zealand from Attila the Hun's ressurected zombie hordes, I got my hands on tech demo for Spintires for the first time. I haven't been the same person ever since. Upon my birth Reptilians have planted a device in my head that lets them read my thoughts. For a reason unknown to me they established Oovee Game Studios (oh come on, doesn't THAT sound Reptilian?) and used all the information they gathered to create a video game of my dreams. In Spintires you assume the role of a Soviet truck driver in 1980's Siberian woodlands where a concept of ""concrete roads"" is considered an imperialists' attempt to weaken the USSR. Your main task (and by far really the only one) is to pick up wooden logs from point A and deliver them to point B. Easy, right? Well... IT'S ♥♥♥♥♥ NOT. At the beginning you get max 2 vehicles - usually a jeep and a small truck. Jeep is purely for exploration purposes, in which it excels, while the truck, in theory capable of delivering small logs, is best in support role as it doesn't even have an all wheel drive. To be able to complete your task you have to start with exploration. Your minimap is full of dark spots which you uncover driving near their centers. Knowing the terrain is critical in planning the route. Even the biggest trucks won't go through rivers and dense forests. You have to drive smart. But even the best route available won't promise you success if you don't have the right equipment. More trucks can be unlocked the same way as minimap which is driving near them. All vehicles can be customised in garages, though the options available vary for each vehicle. Your trucks can carry spare parts (as trucks can be damaged), fuel (as some trucks may use even 20+ liters of fuel per MINUTE of driving), trailers for wooden logs in different sizes (there are 3 sizes of wooden logs). If your main truck is badly damaged or runs out of fuel you can use the other one, with proper equipment, to save it. Whether exploring or completing the delivery your greatest enemy is Russia itself. It does what Russia does. It kills you. It devours you. It consumes both your truck and your very soul. This is where the ♥♥♥♥♥ gets serious. Physics in the game are simply marvellous. Trucks react to every bump, each wheel's suspension is independent, tires deform. Terrain is also gorgeous. Mud deforms under your wheels in real time and it stays deformed for as long as you play on the map, water behaves in a very natural way and you can mow down small trees. The game is pretty difficult and it favors patience. Moving through the mud is slow and painful. More than once you will find yourself stuck or flipped upside down. In many times you will have to use the winch (it's a really helpful tool) or revert your truck back to garage (but only in casual mode. In hardcore mode if you're ♥♥♥♥♥ then you're ♥♥♥♥♥). The game is also moddable. First mods were released for closed beta which sounds promising for the future of this title. There's also multiplayer. There are some downsides as well. Graphics are good but not the best, the only real task so far is delivering wood, the game saves your progress only on one map at once (if you want to play on another map all your progress is lost), maps are similar in many ways, draw distance could be better, lighting at night is pretty awkward AND THE WAY CAMERA WORKS IS A REAL BUMBERFUK. I don't want to sound like a fanboy (even though I am one) but I believe many of those problems will be fixed as both developers and community do their best.  You can download tech demo  BY CLICKING HERE YOU BLIND MOTHERFUKER [oovee.chicsystems.net] to see if the concept of Spintires seems to be appealing to you as I believe it will not be to many. Many of you fukers will be disgusted by it.  So should you buy it then? Yes.	 Because in the end the money you give to the developers, if not you, will at least benefit me, and honestly it's all that really matters.			"

												I like the concept of this game and I used to enjoy playing it.Oovee keeps on implanting more bugs and glitches with every 'update'I do not recommend buying this game and wasting your money.I have played alpha games with less bugs and glitches than this Spintires.Multiplayer is useless now since there are clipping bugs happening on every level.If you survive that then the disconnect glitch will hit you or even crash the game.There is very limited content and they stifle creativity by making user content unavailable.

												This game is phenominal, let me just get that out of the way now. It's an incredibly enjoyable experience, especially with friends. The publisher of this game (Oovee) signed the devs into a rigged contract and have taken the rights to the game from the developers. The publishers have since stopped production on the game. The developers are fantastic, the game is fantastic, but Oovee isn't. Please don't give them money.			"

												Rarely do you see well done or even modern free roam games such as this. I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoy playing this game. Here is a short review and/or summary of this game.First, the mud effects are great. Obviously I have never seen anything like it in a video game to date. Being a person who enjoys mudding in real life, this game was a must get. The ruts that appear after you dirve through an area just really make you feel as if you are there.This game offers a real imersive feel. You can use a winch, you have to worry about fuel, you have to worry about not damaging your vehicle(which by the way, you can see the damage on the vehicle which is a great touch!)and if that isn't enough, there is another hardcore setttings which feature even more realistic additions to make your experience more immersive and of course difficult.The graphics. The graphics are outstanding. They are very pleasing to the eye and definitely cater to the immersive feel and the physics are great. Now you may be thinking that this is game with no objectives at all. Well if you thought that, you are mistaken, because there are logging missions which is another fine touch to this game.There kind of is a short ammount of different vehicles, but said vehicles are customizable and also there are mods to fill your want for a new ride.The multiplayer aspect of this game makes it really enjoyable. You can invite your friend to go along with you exploring and doing whatever you feel like in the large worlds. Be it forging new paths, playing in the mud, playing in the water, hill climbing, logging, or discovering the entire map and unlocking garages in the maps. There are limitless options to what you can do in this game. There is a decent variety of maps for you to choose from allowing you to explore a lot of new land.I truly love this game and got it around when it first came out and have enjoyed it all. Like I said, if you enjoy offroading, mudding, multiplayer, and free roam, this is the game for you. I hope you benefitted from my short review.			"

												SpinTires is a game all about driving and make delivery in the Siberia era. This is a new and fresh type of game for the OFF Road/ Simulator genre. I have been following this game for quite some time back in 2013 when it was Kickstarted and of corse i gave some money on their kickstarter to get the game going on and testet the heavy moddable Tech Demo of the game. Now back to this time SpinTires is now final out, at least with a version with a lot more contenct and objective to it. Now i think it will fallow the same line with Euro Truck with frekvent content updates and pathes for the game. This game is all about driving in very muddiy terrain in the Siberia era. You start off with scouting around the era and unclock the cloucking which enables you to see the era on your map. Then when you have planed your route you can take your Truck and do the log delivery from the lobber mill to the objective destination. I like this idea and it requires you to do more planing which is something i like. I will give you the pros and cons about this game.Pros:- Extremly vell done physic in this game- A lot of fun to drive in the muddy terrain- Pretty decent graphic, not the next Crysis but really great for an Off Road/ Simulator game- Nice combination and well made truck moddels, they also sound great- Fun to explore the map- The game will get a lot of mods which gives this game good value in the long run and gives you good reason to replay it- There is quite amount of add ons to the vehicles- The game runs creat, i get 60 FPS but i also think the frame rate is limited to 60. But that alright. 60 is more than enough (GTX 660 OC)Cons:- The camera is a bit messy, you often have to adjust and it hard to get it work properly. This is something they are working on a fix. There will also be interior camera in the future as far as i know.- Not to many maps to choose between and there is not to much variation on them either, of corse as this game support mods there will come some great community maps later, same goes for the vehicles, there could be more of it but there will also be mods that covers this con.- Not to many objects. The only goal is to delivere logs, it would be cool to delivere something more than just logsSo yeah, the games is very playeble and can't waith for the mods to come. I will say that if you like Euro Truck, Off Road or just wanna have some new and fresh simulator that is good at what it does you will find a lot of it here.			"

The biggest minus is the camera, you will often find it difficult to see what's ahead of you, but hopefully this will be improved in the future. Other than that, it is a great and fun game to play with your friends.			"

												Amazing off-roading/log trucking simulator. Best mud physics I've come across thus far. If you like mudding you'll love this. Unlock garages, deliver logs, uncover the map while working together online or by yourself on singleplayer. If you are going for the objective it definitely takes some patience. Lot's of fun vehicles in workshop if you just want to mess around and see what their capabilities are. Also met half of my friends list on this awesome community! The only con for me in my almost 200 hours of Spintires are the camera angles sometimes, more specifically when you're trying to load logs with trees nearby.			"

												Preliminary review, since I've barely scratched into the game despite putting many hours in.The difficulty of this game is very high.  It's easy to get bogged, to flip, to lose your way.Those lacking persistence will get frustrated and quit. I still have yet to successfully transport a single load of wood.  I got pretty far, but I hit a muddy hill and almost flipped my truck, had to winch out with a chain on a  tree while hitting the gas.When I looked back all the logs had been dumped out except 3.Almost no instructions, no tutorial.  But this just adds to the mystery and challenge, it doesn't feel incomplete nor have I found a single bug.There's a great variety of vehicles, and even more variety in vehicle add ons, many of which I don't understand.I'm not sure it is worth $25, but it'd definitely be worth $10.

												This game is technologically splendid. Somehow I've found myself coming back to haul logs over and over. There's a lot of fun to be had at 2mph crawling through mudpit after mudpit. For something so fundamentally slow paced, this game will keep you on your toes, especially when manoeuvring precious cargo you've trundled 3/4 of the way across the map. Really does keep you thinking and planning. Ah... yes... planning...Cloaking needs to go. I can see the -idea- of necessitating exploration for advancement, but its just awful. I do not get fun from bumbling a super fragile jeep around a forest looking for black tornados. Even with a cheatsheet on my 2nd monitor they're hard to find. I'd rather have a map of the area, with the locations of the vehicles NOT shown until discovered. I'd find that much more rewarding. The crane is a joke too. Its like an arcade claw machine, if you were controlling it with kinect. Its just flat out awful, thanks in part by the bad camera angle.Camera angle, complaints are well documented so i'll skip that.Terrain: Not everything is a 4 foot mud hole, Honestly, I'd love a map with surfaces made of something other than slush which you could use for some serious fun in a Jeep, especially if modding is opened up.

												Is this game worth buying? YES! Yes it is, it is totally worth buying.Why? Well, because it's just awesome! What do you do? Well, you drive different kinds of vehicles to complete objectivesThe game is really well made and even thou it takes ages to go places (as you get stuck quite often) it is gorgeous and you can always change truck at any time and come to rescue your other truck(s)!What's bad with it? Well, there are few minor things that could be changed, first of all, cockpit view, it should be re-added (or added if it haven't been before) More maps (there's only 5 atm)More vehicles to the vanilla (like, add the mod vehicles to the vanilla) and the ability to place out vehicles on your own (like a sandbox mode where you can do what you want)The game is also quite dead, you're the only one out there, maybe add AI's and even animals, like birds, deers and other wild animals.More different enviroments, like snowy mountains, villages and even more (maybe, just maybe deserts too, or anything like it, even thou it'd be weird.....or I dno)  More missions! I haven't played it so much, but so far it's only been driving logs to places, maybe add some more missions, like rescue missions where you have to rescue ppl who's gotten lost in the woods or pull up cars from the ditch, more missions basically!That's about it, what I can tell now, except these few minor things, the game is still really good, and totally worth getting! So if you haven't already, go get it!			"

												This game is revolutionary in the realm of off-road driving simulators as I don't believe there is anything else out there quite like SpinTires.  There is a very impressive realism to the terrain and with the environment all together.  And it can get very unforgiving to the novice explorer.  There is a fair array of trucks to drive and the majarity of them are off-road purpose built, russian military trucks that look quite unstoppable.There is more to this game then just getting stuck waist high in sucking mud, high centering on large rocks or fallen trees or swamping out the engine in deep waters.  You can winch yourself out of tough places.  Plow over trees that get in your way.  Keep in mind, the bigger the truck your driving, the bigger the tree you can crush.  Run fuel and repair supplies to broken down trucks.  Open up other garage places and even haul logs to lumber mills.  In fact, the main objective is to haul lumber to the mills through the most challenging terrain imaginable.  And if that's not enough, you can team up with up to 3 of your friends and tackle the challenge together.The game currently does have some draw backs though.  The camera still needs some work as it can get difficult to see where you want to look.  Especially when your in a tight group of trees, on a steep hill or working with the crane.  The manual transmission mode is awkward and clumsy but you will get use to it over time.  And the multiplayer mode is very lacking.  Yes, you can help your friends by winching them out of tight places or giving them fuel or repairs.  But you can't see their lights, hear their trucks engines or see what they have done to the terrain after they have driven over it.  You can't help your friends load lumber and you can't see your friends trucks that they have abandoned.  Only the trucks they are currently using.Over all, the game is pretty well put together and while being played in hardcore mode, can offer a challenge to even the most seasoned off-roaders.  Given all that I have said, there is a certain level of fun to this game that will have you coming back for more.  And if the creators of this game do something to address the issues I had mentioned above, it would make this game so much more enjoyable.			"

												This is a great engine. The reason I say engine instead of game is because there's actually very little to do once you start playing. You can uncloak hidden areas of each map, unlock vehicles by getting close to them, deliver resources to unlock garages, and finally deliver logs to finish the map objectives, but basically you drive from A to B. I say this not to imply that Spintires isn't worthy of our praise, or your support, but to make it clear that Spintires is not about the destination, so much as the journey there.As other games have similarly done before, Spintires gives us an engine to create our own personalized experiences based on our direct interaction with this games biggest foe, the terrain.  Where Arma 3 has you perform recon and select the most tactical positions for your squad before a firefight, Spintires has you controlling gearboxes and determining the best tire placement over the most unforgiving, and detailed terrain I've ever encountered in a game.  While some people may find Spintires boring, other games have proven over and over that even some of the most tedious tasks supported on a solid foundation can find a strong following.  Those who may find navigating European roads, piloting an aircraft, or managing resources enjoyable may also find some fun and often exhilarating moments in lining up the perfect path between trees, struggling through mud holes with a large log trailer, or winching your friend out of an impossible situation so you can both continue exploring.With the praise I'm giving the game I will point out some flaws. First, the camera isn't the easiest to work with, but this is being remedied. Second, you currently cannot see the terrain deformation caused by fellow players in multiplayer, also planned to be fixed I believe. Third, other small glitches occur(sometimes resources wont be counted as delivered, chat box closes randomly, winch can cause problems occasionally in multiplayer, and other small things that will be addressed).  I would have suggested releasing this title in it's current state under Early Access, because even though I love the game and trust they will fix everything, it doesn't help your credibility to release a title in this state. I would have purchased it at the same price in Early Access, and would not have batted an eye at any bugs or flaws currently occuring, in fact I probably would have been impressed at how completed the title already was. I know this makes no actual difference, but from a consumer standpoint I can see how the developers might have benefitted from the Early Access program, giving them more time to run public beta, and also more funding to allow for the extended beta development stage.This game scratches the itch that I have never been able to reach. It started with 4x4 Evolution and Test Drive: Offroad on PS2, continued with MotorM4x and Offroad Drive on PC, and finally Spintires gets it right.  As it stands I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in any of the titles I just mentioned, I also want to press that this is a much more realistic offroad representation, you will very rarely break the 30mph mark, and you will get stuck often, the game is called Spintires, and it ain't cause your doing burnouts.  If this game receives the mod support it deserves I would bet we will be seeing this game for a long time to come.			"

												If you like offroading, deep mud, and mods, you'll love this game. Basically the point of the game is to pick up lumber, and move it to a different location. However, you vehicle will experience difficulties while traveling there. It goes from Garage, to lumber mill, to objective site. And if you want to spawn closer, just unlock another with garage points that your bring to the garage (4 points). This has a semi-realistic way to when you're off road. Such as Differentiation Lock, All Wheel Drive (4X4, 6X6, and even 8X8). You can get stuck in mud, and winch yourself out, you can get swept away by rivers to only drown, and you can gain or lose damage and fuel.Pros:-Realistic-Co-Op-Mods-Russia-Can be played on low end PCsCons:-Bad Camera View-Can crash sometimes if you get too many mods-Can be extremely frustratingWhy frustrating? Because there are the occasional bugs that can ♥♥♥♥ up your truck. For example (I don't know if they fixed this), sometimes if the winch is in a bad spot, it can fling your truck in the air, and completely diable your truck. Other times, you get stuck in mud way too often, or a spot in the water may not ""look"" too deep, and you drown. And other times if you travel on a hilly area, and go across the side of a hill with a load, you can tip over, and drop your entire load.Even if it is frustrating, it's still fun to play, and a great game to play with three other friends! :DHope to see you guys out there! :)			"

												SPINTIRES™ is a very particular game. The kind of particular where, if you like trudging through where few men have dared trudge before, you'll like this game. I definitely don't think it's a game for everybody. What is very unique to SPINTIRES™ is the comradery between people in multiplayer. Especially on hardcore mode. There is no shortage of people wanting to drag you out of muddy holes or swampy lakes, and with a smile. Even sometimes flipping you if the somewhat erratic physics engine decides that your biggest potential is achieved while lying on your back. SPINTIRES™ certaintly has potential since there is still some progress to be had, as the only objectives so far is retrieving logs.I give the game a 7.9/10 "

												Do I recommend this game? If you have a few friends, some patience, a love for grunting big trucks and mud....then 100% yes!! While there appears to be some drama going on with the developer, I'm too new to the game to be up on the whats what and th whose who.  All I know is that when the Naked Beach Komber crew makes a convoy and heads off into the wood, a good time is had by all.  Buy it on sale, regret nothing!*or get it bought for you...even better!! Thanks Dirty ♥♥♥♥* Mar 9/16 - Hey even the best of games run into a hiccup. Seems that some childish activity on the part of Oovee, or however it's spelt, and the need for a paycheque for the maker Pavel have ground this game to a halt. Hidden parts of the code are showing time release bugs. At present its completely unplayable.  Do yourself a favour and don't buy it at this point. Maybe in the future they will get their sh!t together.  RIP best offroad game ever29.99 Feb 24/2017 - DO NOT PAY THIS MUCH FOR THIS GAME. Great physics, great game but epic failure at follow through.

												There are some things in life that, whilst, for whatever reason it may be, a decent game is a let down. Well, for me, this is the reverse. When I  first saw Spintires I didn't believe it would be any good. Then I tried the tech demo they released and was pleasantly surprised. Obviously this game is not a standard fare AAA title from the likes of Electronic Arts, Codemasters, Valve, even RAREWARE* for the Xbox. It is built around off-road physics and the ability to drive, off-road. Sounds simple, but alas the engine running the game needs to be capable of correctly calculating every nuance in the road surface, each dip and lip of hill or rock. I never thought they would be able to do it, but yet here I am.The vehicles in any game like this, can make or break it. This game has a few vehicles, including the mighty MAZ. But it may leave a distinct taste in the mouth of people who love having a decent selection on offer. Although you should stop there and ignore that taste left by the lack thereof, and continue on and really get to grips with the physics of the game itself. It is true, it is not a game for everyone, but where this game fails, it delivers in almost atop fashion by capturing your every thought pattern.The main reason for this game, is the physics and the ability to take what you believe you know, off-roading, and put it to the test. The basic premise of the game is to take a delivery from one part of the map, to the other. Simple enough, but then you also have to worry about damage and your fuel, because as we all know, roaming about hills takes it's toll on your fuel reserves. The maps themselves, have a ""fog of war"" to them. In-game it is known as ""cloaked"", and by ""de-cloaking"" areas you open up more of the map that you get to see when you are driving. Otherwise you have to play it by feel alone, trusting in your compass. Added is the ability to lock your diff's on the various vehicles as well as enabling and disabling All-Wheel drive. Although I must point out, that using a locked diff, your vehicle's turning radius is less, than when off. Both your diff locks and All-Wheel drive's will consume more fuel, so proper planning is needed for that. The rest, I feel is best left unsaid and left to the player to find and enjoy.Along the way as you try to get your cargo from one location to the next, are various hazards you must negotiate. Whilst it is an off-roading game, it never feels like I have to race from one location to the next, but simply to take it at my own pace, and maximise my uses of the vehicle I am currently driving.The camera in the game itself, is rather odd in it's own unique way and composition. It moves differently to how another game may implement. Of course all this has been said before. So I shall take my leave, leaving this one last comment and score.If you are unsure about the game, as it will only appeal to a certain few, try the free demo from the official site, and if you need more content, the game is moddable, and many mods exist.-------Graphics: 92%Gameplay: 91%Longevity: 84%Overall: 89%(*RAREWARE currently known as RARE, bought by Microsoft from Nintendo.

												Spintires Review --- MorrisReview --- 16 July 2015STORY AND GAMEPLAYSpintires hasn't got a real story, it's more like a game, where the player can complete many tasks. You play as a russian lumberman and you task is it, to transport logs from one point to another point on the map. You complete your mission with old Russian trucks in a world out of mud, water (rivers and seas) and very big forests, which are distributed on the map. At this moment, Spintires offers you 6 different maps, more of them are in deployment. The primary intention of Spintires is it, to drive the different old trucks, to find a way completing your mission. You do that in the third person perspective on the left side near your truck. Once started the game you can decide what you want to do:Explore the world and find new ways to complete your task?You want to try something out or only playing in the open world?Or want you to play in the multiplayer?It's your choice!TECHNOLOGY In Spintires you have a lots of options to change the game. Next to the basically options you can play Spintires also with the Gamepad, Xbox 360 controller or a wheel.The controlling and timing fits well with the game. The graphics and sounds are fluently also on middle sized computers, but sometimes small lags could you be appear. Graphics a very detailed, for example mud, which flies around you vehicle and realistic water animations. How realistic it is, is addicted to the power of your computer.The game maybe won't start at the first time and could crash while playing. To save your progress there is only one memory location, if you want to start a new game on another map, you have to delete the old memory unit. POSITIV's and NEGATIV's+ beautiful and realistic locations and vehicles+ detailed trucks and settings+ also controllable with alternative methods + continued deployment + two game modes for individual simulation + available in 16 languages - start problems, crashes and save problems - lags while playing - ""only"" six maps and a handful of vehicles- possibly difficult controls - Multiplayer is possibly very insecureCONCLUSION Spintires is a good game with a great idea and a lots of potential in it. But until it's great or perfect, there is missing a lot of work and time. This game is something for people, who have fun driving big trucks with bigger mileage or who are a bit bored and want to taste a day of work with lumbermen. Actually Spintires costs 24,99€ on steam, I don't really recommend the game for this price, wait until it's on sale or deployed longer.Because the game is already under deployment, I will write more reviews with more actual information in the future!MorrisReview			"

												Best game ive played in a while ive been playing it for the last 2 hours of my life and have enjoyed every minute of it. ive been waiting for this game for a long time now since its kickstarter days and now its finally here and i love it. Although the camera controlls are bad and need improvement but other then that its solid. With controlller support now and wheel support coming in the future you cant beat it. Although a small tracked vehicle whould be nice for schouting other then the uaz, im sure they will add one as they promissed and you can tell by the forums. Wonderful graphics and runs great on anything other then a toaster. And to everyone whos posting bad reviews saying, ""the route lead me through trees which i had to push over"". Well if anyone has actually gone out exploring in some form of off road vehicle then you will understand that sometimes you have to forge your own trails. Love it 9.5/10.Btw. in the tech demo i found it hard to find good places to try and get stuck in this there are just boatloads went from looking for mud to looking for dry land.			"

												Having received a Early Access key by luck, i had a chance to look at this before it is released. I did not know anything about it before, but must say this is a great game/simulation. It isunfortunately not working that good with a dedicated graphics card in a laptop (AMD Enduro technology) but it is working still great on the cpu integrated graphics with an intel i7. Gamewise this is done with passion to simulate the ""real thing"" in my eyes. It not easy but also no science degree is needed to get it working. It is fun to play! Period. If you like simulations, then get this! It is developed with ""love"" as far as i see it and i am sure anything that is not yet ironed out will be in further updates. Full recommended.			"

												Getting kicked out of multiplayer and ending up at starting point with all progress undone! Almost makes me cry after spending two hours collecting lumber.... The trailers are also sometimes almost impossible to attach ""Position your truck properly"" keeps reappearing. Really annoying. And the menues in the garage? Seriously??As the developers havn't been able to fix these basic game functions I can't recommend this game. But! It's really nice to drive offroad truck in the middle of nowhere, it's a great idea to start with and somehow it works really well as a social multiplayer game. Talking ♥♥♥♥, drinking beers and driving off road trucks is just awesome.			"

												Pros:Graphics, physics, simulation, maps.  Everything feels like some chunky Soviet diesel trucks.  The way the mud deforms actually creates new terrain there that you can get stuck in the second or third time through.  Water is a volume that'll smack your truck when you try to cross a river or stream.  You have to basically learn how to manage when to use differential lock (press Q), when to use automatic to save fuel, and when to use all-wheel-drive.  90% of this game is actually doing your best to not get stuck in mud and figuring out the best paths to get unlocks and objectives.  Also, don't flip over.  If you flip over, don't flip the truck you brought to flip the first one back.  If you flip the second truck, don't flip the third truck you brought to help.  Also dont put 3200L of fuel in a cistern and try to pull it with the RWD Type-B through muddy hills, you WILL just sink into the mud and not move forever.Cons:The camera takes some getting used to and if you play with buddies and one of them disconnects and re-joins, every truck they have is wiped from the game and they start fresh at whatever the starting garage is.  This can be frustrating because you will disconnect at some point probably, especially if you alt tab.  I've seen it on many occasions, so do your best to not alt-tab out of the game once you start.			"

												I have not playd much of Spintires, but it already has me hooked. The gameplay is easy enough for a newbie like myself. In the game, you will find yourself traversing the harshest terrain utilizing certain vehicles. ALthough, there is no set story line, there are several objectives in single-player. This can make the game a bit more relaxed, but the content isn't really there. Onto multiplayer, this is where the real content shines throuhg. I did not play much of it, but wthe games I joined had people completing the objectives, working together. People would say how thye were going to do certain objectives. These objectives include utilizing different vehicles to perform different things (EX: A logging truck to pick up logs, dump trucks). This is a fun game, with decent enough graphics. 79/100.			"

												I ask myself repeatedly why I like this game so much... I guess the only answer is it somehow fulfills something deep inside... That little kid I used to be who would play with tonka trucks in dirt and mulch.As I use my winch to shimmy my truck through deep mud for like the billionth time I can't help but feel sheer joy as I finally break free and take off down the road once more.My major pro: probably the future in terrain deformation in this game... makes the craters and things you see in games like battlefield look like childs play. My major Con:  Don't try to use the crane to pick up logs... it will make you go insane.I've seen people complain about the camera and it IS wonky at times but you do get used to it just like anything else.another smaller con is sometimes it's a little TOO easy to get your smaller trucks stuck.

												Great game, the ground deformation are beautiful, the water is great, everything just looks nice. If you get frustrated with the game the thing that will save you is the winch. Since there is nowhere explaining how to use it I will.When you are in your vehicle and you press the advanced options button (default is V) and place your cursor over your vehicle you will see small white circles at least on the front of your vehivle if it is equiped with a winch (I think all ar eother than the orange trucks). Clicking on this winch point will show small white circles where the winch can be attached such as other vehicles or trees. When you press that the cable will appear and you can do multiple things here. A. Just press the pull button (default is F) and pull yourself out of trouble. B. Exit advanced options mode so you can steer and drive to assist the winch as you pull. C. If you are pulling another vehicle a winch vehicle options set will appear, set this to auto so the vehicle you are towing will steer itself and go along with you.Before I knew about the winch I hated the game and now I actually love itMost other info can be found in the game manual, you can find it with the manual button on the right side of your library screen when you have SPINTIRES selected			"

												If you think truck trials are cool, you'll like this. It's often slow going, and you'll definitely get stuck a few times, but it's quite satisfying when you're careful and everything goes according to plan. The maps have some variety, but I'd like to see sand and bedrock added as terrains, right now the biggest obstacles are mud and boulders.			"

												Like 4x4, off road or games?Want to play a game with your friends where you are not racing each other but rather helping each other out?Spin Tires could be the game for you.. The game is a little tricky to get used to with its external mouse driven camera and functions that are a little cluncky but otherwise this is in my opinion is one of those little games that surprise you.The gameplay I have played as of this review(not a lot) orientates around driving around unlocking the visibility of the map, moving objects from A to B to unlock other services(garages, fuel stations) on the map and... of course... rescue the vehicles you abuse doing so.The game has many many addons you can put on vehicles to achieve tasks like refueling, repair and doing other task I am sure I am still yet to discover.It also boasts 4 player multiplayer so you and your off road buddies can hook up and rip around or play coop.Driving is currently oriented around Keyboard play but with huge demand from the community the Devs have stated in the next major update they will add support for controllers and wheels and the like, also THERE IS NO CAB VIEW... you cannot go 'Inside' your vehicle currently, this is totally a third person camera game at present that is mouse controlled.Once again the Devs are listening and have said while they cannot say when, but there is lots of demand for in cab view and they will be looking to implement this also.All in all, this game is enjoyable, it plays well once you adapt to the controls and you will find yourself in some humorous situations like floating down a river, sunk deep in mud and if you are like me.. on your side, very fun, looks great and honestly the way the mud and ground is ripped up by your tires looks great.

												UPDATED REVIEWAll I have seen since buying this game has been improvement.Controller support enhances the game tenfold, making hardcore mode even more enjoyable.Wheel support for those with steering wheels is I'm sure a drastic improvement as well.Rogue jumping rocks have been patched.Wheels getting stuck under the map have been patched.Multiplayer has been improved.Winch glitches have been patched.Now I can tow my friends in multiplayer much more smoothly.Optimization continues to improve. I had a friend lose his computer, so he downloaded Spintires onto a seven year old Dell and it runs smoothly on the lowest settings.You are now able to preview future updates by opting into their most recent beta releases.Graphics drastically improve.Also future updates call for mod support.I have only good things to say about this game. Absolutely love it.Below is a snippet of my old review.---Even my friends who could care less about off-roading enjoyed this game.Everything about it is beautiful, every time I stop my truck it looks like a promotional screenshot.Has everything you would want in an offroading game, absolutely everything, and anything anyone else would want in a co-op challange.Having your truck frustratingly sunk or tipped in some mud is crushing. Absolutely crushing. But, that nigh-impossible recovery is oh-so satisfying.Need I also mention that this game is FANTASTICALLY optimized. The graphics are unbelievable and gameplay is flawlessly smooth.Short story, I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you're on the fence, don't think twice. This is worth every penny.			"

												I started out playing this game on keyboard, it was fun, trying to find the right gear in a split second. Then I moved onto an Xbox 360 controller, I didn't find that as fun. Then I bought a Logitech Driving Force wheel, and that was very fun. Now I have a G27 and this game is an absolute blast to play. The workshop makes it so much easier to play with mods, especially the feature that lets you install mods the lobby leader has selected that you aren't subscibed to. While it might not be terribly realistic, it is one of the best offroad games, ever. Well worth buying if you are into the whole offroading scene.			"

The details of the trucks and the world is amazing :) It feels really authentic. I never ever thought i could be more happy to get stuck in the mud before after this, I will look forward to do soo in the future.

												I have not playd much of Spintires, but it already has me hooked. The gameplay is easy enough for a newbie like myself. In the game, you will find yourself traversing the harshest terrain utilizing certain vehicles. ALthough, there is no set story line, there are several objectives in single-player. This can make the game a bit more relaxed, but the content isn't really there. Onto multiplayer, this is where the real content shines throuhg. I did not play much of it, but wthe games I joined had people completing the objectives, working together. People would say how thye were going to do certain objectives. These objectives include utilizing different vehicles to perform different things (EX: A logging truck to pick up logs, dump trucks). This is a fun game, with decent enough graphics. 79/100.			"

												After more than 18 hours in this game I can say - it's good (really good)This is basically a Russian truck simulator. You can choose the map, the difficulty and scenario (different starting trucks) The quest is to deliver all the logs to the ones in need. A lot of perks will help you in your adventure through the forests. You can uncover the map from cloacking points and unlock new vehicles.(♥♥♥ well as awesome trading cards and achievments)pros:- awesome physics- beautiful textures- one of a kind gamecons:- not much replayability- quite bad multiplayerAll in all the game is fantastic and if you can get it on sale it is worth every penny. 10/10 would sink my truck again!

												Worth the 30$? No, buy it on sale for 15 $ or less. It is a rather fun game as it is different than a lot of others out there, I enjoy the logistics of transporting fuel and recovering vehicles half submerged in mud. I suppose it helps if you're a sucker for Soviet hardware as well. There are a few maps, but it takes some time to fully explore each. Overall the game could be expanded upon, but as I understand it there are a number of mods out there, though I have yet to give any a try. "

												I started out playing this game on keyboard, it was fun, trying to find the right gear in a split second. Then I moved onto an Xbox 360 controller, I didn't find that as fun. Then I bought a Logitech Driving Force wheel, and that was very fun. Now I have a G27 and this game is an absolute blast to play. The workshop makes it so much easier to play with mods, especially the feature that lets you install mods the lobby leader has selected that you aren't subscibed to. While it might not be terribly realistic, it is one of the best offroad games, ever. Well worth buying if you are into the whole offroading scene.			"

												When I first heard of SpinTires I thought, how is being stuck in mud in any way entertaining?Well, it really is.SpinTires is a challenge, a battle between an unforgiving nature and man-made machines, a game where little progress is better than no progress. When you first play the game being able to go 500m without getting stuck is huge. There's no GPS to show you the easiest way to go from A to B, you have to find it yourself, you have to decide, and finally live with the consequences.Oh, and don't trust the path you took before, the mud's always getting worse.(of course you can always reset your trucks back to the workshop but where's the fun in that :D )The only negative point so far is the impossibility to save multiplayer. So with friends, you're forced to play it as a roguelike experience. The problem is noted by the devs and will (hopefully) soon be addressed.			"

												There's not really much to do in this initial release other than take stuff places.  Think Euro Truck Simulator in the dirt and mud.  The graphics, lighting and physics are really neat.  It just screams for screenshots everywhere you go.  The camera can get a bit funky offering less FOV than you would like sometimes, and the interface could be easier to navigate.  Once you get to the actual driving and transporting, it can be very fun.  If you liked playing with Tonka trucks as a kid, this might be just the thing for you.			"

												*** Another Revised Review ***So, good ol' SPINTIRES. It has had a lot of up's and downs. Mostly circling around the Dev and the Pub's ' misunderstanding, arguements, much spread tales of hate '.. choose one.It also suffered the ' time bomb ' for which the community found an answer, then an official fix came later.NOW if you remove the drama from the outside, and just take the game itself... its a must have for mud fans, fans of tough real life based work in a place that many of us have experienced...The game is very realistic in attempting to navigate the mud / water hazards. If you ever experienced time in Europe back in the cold war days, these fields and roads ( or what pass for roads ) are sure to bring bitter memories of cold, wet, stuck in the mud nights and days of places like Hohenfeld, Graf, Reforger moments...  You will suffer the same fate of smaller wheeled vehicles trying to navigate along tracks torn up time and time again by heavier vehicles.. you will be stuck.. you will see and hear the mud sucking you deeper in.. But its fun. Especially since unlike the real life days.. you dont have to get out and sink in the mud or water.. ah.. love the sim for the lack of misery from those days!!  HINT: If you do remember tricks from the days of following a line of tanks and APC's in a battered 2 1/2 ton you will do well.. Reasons to play: Its fun.Its a great candy for the eye. Watch the mud fly, stick to your truck.. build up on the tires.. knock / fall off on hard tops and run it through water to clean up a bit.If you ever thought mudding would be fun. Mods. Mods are amazing. ( STEAM does have a workshop )Never had a problem tech wise out of it. I missed the actual time bomb myself, I was involved in another game at the time. But no problems before or after that. Reasons to not play:The drama. One way or another, if you follow the updates or post of others.. you will hear see about the drama. Everyone has some opinion. But I dont advise to buy or not based on that. If you cannot imagine being stuck in the mud.. or a load overturned on the side of a mud track and trying to figure out how to recover the load, the wrecked truck and still deliver the logs as amusing.. If you have PTSD related to those frozen nights in Europe when the mud would freeze so hard you had to have an M88 recover you.. ** Its a great way to kill time. ** SP and Co Op available.

												Offroad simulator 2014 Russian edition.Anyway, great game... very realistic and lot of fun! Pull your friends out from mud... unlock garages, vehicles and discover maps. Objective is to carry logs. Maps are very beautiful and co-op players are very helpful and friendly. Vehicles are from real life Russia, UAZ 469, ZIL - 130 and even more and you can even modify them for your supposes (Fuel, car parts, garage supplies, wood) . There is day and midnight timecycle. Maps are hard, pass the rivers, heavy mud, swamps and even more... i could say its a real challenge, but even fun with friends. Takes sometimes even hours to reach the location you need. Play singleplayer, or then co-op with 4 people/friends. Theres even a gearbox, you can choose manual instead of automatic in game, not from options! Also... there are great vehicle and map mods for this game in internet allready, only thing some people might dont like, is view camera... I like it, its unique.I Highly recommend this game and its even worth this money.			"

												i have marked this as recommend but read below i understand this is in beta but the issues below should of been common practice for a game maker i have made games myself and thease are allways a priority first.i like the game in general but there are some issues that need to be addressed 1 the major thing i find very frustrating is when in single player if you roll on your side in some positions you can't start your engine which if realistic but you can't winch your self over and in the single player mode you can not get help so you have to restart the game and lose all progress.this needs to be fixed fast before it discourages buyers from buying the game it is a easy fix just allow the player to port back to the garage to grab another truck. #2 is a better camera view when in the advanced mode with a better field of view to allow better winching to see attachment points as well to allow to attach wile in free cam mode more zoom out and a bit longer winch would be nice as well.#3 save game so you can go back and try again see first issue this will be easer than having a port to a shop for another truck.

												Understand first and foremost that this is a niche simulation.  If you have no interest in large industrial trucks, off roading, and a little vehicle management then this is not the game for you.  While the screen shots and trailer show you all of that goodness, they dont show you the subtle complexity of the maps.  Think of this like a game of Klotski, the block puzzle game where you have to slide varying shaped and sized blocks inside a rectangle to get a colored block out of the rectangle.  The trucks are the regular blocks, you move them around the map to get the colored block (lumber) to the objective.  It sounds easy, but if you have played the block game then you know that sometimes it takes many moves to win.  You will have to set up your trucks with right attachments at the garage, and position them on the map accordingly, so that you can move the lumber.  The devs have made every map unique, from swollen deep rivers to little paths through the hills to highways of mud, there will be obstacles all along the way.  Count yourself lucky if you find a paved road, it saves you fuel and damage to your truck.  Those are two factors that have to constantly be managed.  After a while you start finding yourself considering every turn and path to see how not to get stuck axel deep in a quagmire.  So there are two levels of complexity, simply navigating your vehicle, and the working the vehicles in concert.  Keep in mind that nothing about the gameplay is fast.I came into this with no expectations having bought the game because a friend was really into the genre and wanted to play.  I've been glued to the game and my friend has been offline the whole time.  I think the graphics in the screen shots and trailer speak for themselves, and the sounds are pretty good.  The day night cycle adds depth, but isn't a hindrance to playing.  Changing weather would be a nice touch that's missing.  I can't wait to see what the devs add from this point on, but brands like Hummer, Jeep, Landrover, etc. should line up to get product placement in this.			"

												I have played this for more than 20 hours and therefore here is my review based on what i've played -I haven't played all the maps yet-I drove all vehicles with all possible attachementsSo, in Spintires you use several vehicles to get lumber from point A to point Bif in hardcore mode, you'll need fuel. you need to go get it with a vehicle tanker (or a vehicle you choose to equip with a tank) and bring back that fuel .roads are VERY inhospitable: mud, rivers, lakes, rocks , mud, more mud, mud that feels like quicksand , and also mud. oh yeah and trees. All vehicles have different capabilities in certain terrain . You will inevitably get stuck and have to winch your way out, either yourself or with another vehicle (could be a friend in multiplayer) or you will capsize and have to put back your truck on all wheels (same way) doing stupid stuff damages vehicles, you can repair them with special utility trailers that you have to drive yourself.Now the major part of the game is basically driving around in very bad terrain using AWD and differential lock wisely (uses more fuel) and having to navigate in a map where you need to manually decloak everything (or not if you know the map by heart) you do get a compass.The game simulates night and day.You can pack wood by yourself but the game actually makes you put 3 logs in a truck and by a click of the mouse you make those 3 logs be a full complement of wood (Don't really like that for immersion )or, you click on a load wood button in a lumber area and voila the wood is in your trailer.I thought you'd have to cut it yourself or something but no. it magically appears.I'm having a lot of fun getting stuck by trying stupid stuff and new routes (the more dangerous the more fun it is), capsizing, getting back using the truck crane , and with a few friends (4 players max in a game) it can get very amusing.A good buy on sale or at about 15€ I guess, since the game although very playable isn't very full with material, it's more a sandbox in which you can have fun with friends.

												Oh just buy it, for crying out loud. The fact you're checking out the reviews shows you want it. It's big, muddy off-road driving. The game's been out for ages so there's plenty of YouTube videos showing what to do if you're not sure (which I wasn't tbh).The whole game is less than 1gb, it runs perfectly fine on low-end machines, it has controller support (though not fully, but you only need the mouse in addition not the keyboard).Trust me, the moment you properly use the diff-lock to scale that mud-caked hill you'll be punching the air in triumph!

												A very, very addictive game/physics sim. If you like heavy transport with the best modelled exquisite detail? Then this is the game for you. There's a reason it has external cameras; you will be constantly enjoying the vehicle bucking and twisting as it goes over rocks, branches and bogs down in ruts full of mud and water. The game is pure eye candy!  Water physically Pushes against Your truck and cleans mud off your caked wheels.  Loading logs is pretty easy with an Xbox controller and gives you another sense of the passion that Oovee have put into this. The truck will move as it's loaded up or as you lift loads with the crane. it will physically sit down in the mud or on its suspension. It will also quite simply topple over if it's limits are exceeded. Very realistic indeed. Gameplay is a bit cheesy with' cloaking ' points needing to be uncovered to view hidden vehicles or tracks/roads across water or which are the ""correct"" path, which are otherwise completely black on the map view. The game truly doesn't need this as the true battle is finding your way across terrain or water, that will in an instant trap your vehicle or drown it! Meaning you have to try and recover it to a garage by towing it, or clicking it back to a garage you have unlocked or in the worst scenario, starting the map all over again. The pleasure is managing your fuel, putting tankers in strategic points on your route and using correct vehicles to both deliver your load and pull your vehicle out of drastic situations. Once you finish the maps you will be crying out for more!! You want expansion packs, more trucks, challenges, cranes, punctures, business model, trains, real roads like ETS2 etc.  The list is endless, it leaves your craving tons more. You end up watching real Vids of Russian trucks hauling logs or *anything* mud related; hill climbs for eg. The sad thing is there is nothing in the pipeline at the moment. Oovee have released the truck editor and soon a map editor, but it's like they have passed the buck to the community to keep this, very unusual, sim alive. It's frustrating along with a very,very annoying trait that every time Oovee release an update, it wipes out your game saves. Leaving all those maps as if you've never been there.. Somehow you are still drawn towards it but it will no doubt test the patience of gamers unless they sort this issue out. Try the demo out, which was at Oovee site.Edit: Some very good truck models on the workshop that have extended the life of this, but sadly nothing further in the way of anything pc related future expansions.. The consoles appear to be the primary target now. How sad...			"

												Its hard to explain what joy you can get from trying to push a Russian HGV thrugh tough terrian, muddy bogs, rushing rivers, mixed forests.The goal is simple, carry logs from a lumber yard to objective across some of the toughest 4x4 terrian going. The methods available, especially when playing in multiplayer, are wide, fun, edge of seat stuff (when you just hoping not to get bogged down by taking a short cut) and joyful when your friends assist you out of a problematic situation.Day and night cycles.Amazing mud/traction/diffirential vehicle and environment physics.Multiplayer with friends is amazing fun, assist each other, by using combination of trucks, utility, repairs, refueling, to allow log carrying to success.See I've tried my best to explain why this game is unique, and cutting edge stuff. And I cant give it justice.I can tell you what its not, its NOT a ultra complicated simulation game.its NOT a chor to play, it is great fun.It is,Beautiful to look at,Great fun,Challenging at many levels from beginner to hardcore, from singleplayer to multiplayer.Xbox 360 controller compatible (and works very well with)			"

												6 hours.  Wow, that felt like nothing at all, and I'm going back for more.  The idea of a game about trucking through the woods and mud and water doesn't exactly scream awesome, but it has a genuine appeal.From driving your little jeep through the trees to uncover the cloaking on maps, to driving the big rigs down muddy roads, it's all fun.  Put a crane on the back of your truck and you can lift logs onto another truck or the one you're in if it's got a trailer.  Get stuck?  Instant reset back at your garage...to try the same route over again and see if you can do better.  Or grab another truck and head out to the stuck one and hook a winch up to it and drag it out of trouble.  Aww yea..Love it, glad for the purchase.			"

												Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF): I like the game. Spintires is a great game for a niche group of like minded people, meaning, if you enjoy putting games at their max difficulty (Hardcore for Spintires) and actually playing the game as it is intended by immersing yourself in the game world and approaching the challenges as realistically as you can if you were faced with a similar scenario in real life you will find a pleasant and challenging experience. Alternatively, if you just want to mod the ever living hell out of the game and put vehicles and random stuff in it you will greatly diminish your experience. I challenge the modders to put meaningful mods in the game in the future and add a more interesting challenge or environment vice building ""super trucks"" that you just direct around the map. The community that this game brings can make a drastic impact on Spintires' future (positive or negative).			"

Only negative sides to this game is that it crashes alot when tabbing out and messing with the settings. Also the Maps are a bit repetative. I think personally adding a playground where you can just take all the cars trucks and just messabout, obsitcle courses etc. But this game is still being worked on :) If you like off road games I would recommend this one!

												I have not played long yet, and I will update this as I put more time into it.  First I love the idea described, but I don't feel it is delivered on correctly.  I was hoping to really have an opportunity to try to find my way to a destination with minimal information, but mostly they give you no chance to get lost, so I spent my time trying to find the least hazardous route.  I can say the camera is awful and they could stand to add more variety to the road conditions, it seems like they decided Russia is all made of mud.  And really I find it hard to imagine a game like this releasing with basically no support for steering wheels, though it is less needed in this game then racing games, but still I bought the stupid wheel because it's the only thing that make driving games less likely to make me want to throw my controller.So the fun parts, I really do think ultimately I like this game, but I do wish there was more of a ""game"" there, but maybe I just am not far enough yet.  I found the physics and the intense feeling as my big ugly truck hurtled down a hill I had no idea was there, to be pretty cool.  I think this game has a lot of potential and my hope is that they will continue to add content.  I don't like that this feels obviously like a game still in development, but was not indicated as such clearly, but that is the way of PC gaming now and I can't say there is any reason to wait any longer if you have been eyeing this, other then the price :)			"

												I don't have many hours on record. But I have played a lot of the tech demo. This is by far one of the best off road games I have ever played. The physics are excellent. Beautiful visuals. Amazing erosion. I have done a lot of real life for willing. And I am amazed at how well this game captures the real experience. The tech demo had a massive amount of mods. So I would imagine this one (the full release) will as well here shortly. This is a simulation style off-road game. But it has a great combination between a fun arcade experience and near hard-core simulation experience. I would highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys off-road games and/or car driving games.

												I've been playing SpinTires since the prototype. and I still love coming back to playing this game, and now that the game has online functions, I've never had so much fun, I laughed so much when my friend fell ♥♥♥ over backwards on a hill he was trying to climb for 5 minutes.This game is great when you are playing with 2 - 3 other friends, the single player mode is fun.. IF you are an offroad guy like I am. If not, you will not enjoy the singleplayer. Its also best to play with people you know, because 90% of the time, you won't find a lobby with people to play with, and with a lack of VOIP in the game, its hard to talk to the other players, but there is a chat option.unless you are really into offroading, I don't reccomend buying this game at full price, but if you can buy it cheaper ($15 or lower) then buy it.SpinTires is a really fun games with friends, its unique with its gameplay, it looks great and can run on most systems.I highly reccommend SpinTires if you can find it at a discounted price, and have 2 or more friends to play with.

												The sad reminder to Rigs of Rods fans that you can't make a deformation simulator and expect it to succeed without development.It's a lot like rigs of rods; it appears to use a similar deformation system for the terrain, and it includes a couple cars and trucks, also like rigs of rods, development is so slow, everyone that might have made content left before the game was completely developed, because the game, as it is now, is boring. All of the effort in the game seems to be put into the terrains. Vehicles are poorly modled and textured, and the physics? lol. Since it's release, it's gotten two or three new levels, and other than a new manual clutch system (which doesn't really fix the problem) the physics hasn't been touched. Not a lot of user content that works, a couple are decently made, and by decently made I mean they look better than the ""photorealism"" textures from 2001 that the default trucks use. Speaking of default trucks, some of them don't really serve a purpose after you get other trucks(B-130), or any purpose at all(UAZ). You can now change your start trucks to completely opt-out of using them to begin with. If you want a nice physics based vehicle game where you can hit mud, climb hills, and other stuff, just get Rigs of Rods, it might be dead, but its free, and there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of content for it. If you find you like Rigs of Rods and don't want it to be dead, try BeamNG, its basicly a clone, even has some dev work from RoR guys, and they've got growing quality content too. TL;DR: There are games that do it better, much better, and much cheaper(free).			"

												The point of Spintires is to deliver logs. That's it. Logs. You know what? It's AMAZING!!! The textures are highly detailed, the physics are suberb and you have a whole garage of Russian military vehicles to aid you in your mission to deliver logs across all terrains, crossing rivers, mudpits, scaling rocky cliffs. What's more, player's attitudes toward this are fantastic. Never have I met a nicer bunch of people than on a Spintires multiplayer game, where after completing the map everyone thanked me just for hosting the server! Another time I played with three Russians, not speaking a word of their language, and we all knew exactly what to do, helping each other out of the stickiest situations. Competitive gaming is okay as far as I'm concerned but nothing feels better than helping your peers cooperatively. Buy it now.			"

												Finally the real thing is here after years with tech demos.Game is awesome, totally free roam with lots of challenges, but no closed Circuit, no point to point racing.....actually no racing at all, its all about trial and error where error spells disaster so u end up stuck, too damaged or out of fuel and hence u will soon enough learn to drive very carefully, just like u would irl.The physics are superior to every other driving game ive ever tried (ive tried quite a few), Spintires has all the things we always wanted in an offroad game, manual diff lock, enable/disable AWD, winches and cranes.You can even winch out ur fellow driver if hes stuck somewhere, bring fuel and/or repair his truck on site.There are however some things that needs to get sorted, like the camera, its a chase-cam that can be moved a little using the mouse, but it acts in an annoying way that prevents u from seeing what u r actually looking for, because it centers the truck that makes it obstruct ur view.Controls aren't always all that easy and not really explained anywhere in game, well some controls are, but things like how to operate the crane isn't, ive been struggling for 20 mins with it as it wont let me control one piston at a time, hence it moves both pistons in or out at the same time, making it impossible to use.Theres nothing to find online, Ive googled several times for several things about the game, simple things like ""Spintires How to use the winch"" aso., but I get zero results that has an actual answer, so it goes for the crane control, all I get is a video that demonstrates how it can move (controlling one piston at a time) but nothing about how its actually done.So better/more extensive in game help (maybe even a tutorial), rewrite of the camera so itll move ""freely"" and with the option of a wider perspective.A fully manual gearbox would be nice too, so far u can choose from 4 gear lever positions 'Auto, 1st, rev' and a position that makes the engine stall.Also manual reduction gear would come in handy a lot of the time, especially when passing over rocks where too much speed (approx. >3 km/h (1.5 mph)) will cause damage to the truck.It would be good for going down steep hills as well, where ur truck otherwise gets some heavy dmg when u hit the bottom and for these things, even 1st gear allows for too much speed.Despite these issues, I still think its incredible good quality compared to the issues we normally experience in other games just after release.Ive been playing for a few hrs straight and never do I experience any lag or similar issues, everything just runs super smooth all the time, gfx are set on max all the way and im even on an old GF GTX470 gfx card, so the games graphics are indeed very light to run and I can see on my NVidia monitor, that it takes up about 500MB of VRAM, which isn't much by todays standards.As far as for realism, ive never tried driving any of the vehicles irl, but I can say that driving that 6 wheeler in this game, is very much similar to driving the Hydrema 922 dumper, in the sense on how it handles at different speeds, going thru rough terrain etc., so ill say the game feels pretty real for most parts.One thing they shd consider imo, is the rocks, they have weird physics and doesn't feel like rocks, also the truck tires has very little friction when passing over rocks which seems wrong and the rocks doesn't get squeezed into the mud when passing over them in well, mud.All in all, if u like free roam off roading, buy the game, u wont regret it. :-)			"

The short versionSpinTires is a quick and easy game to get into if you want some aimless fun exploring the map in a truck. With mud. And Trees.Add in the 4 player multiplay and hilarity ensues as you bump someone off an embankment into the water, or get serious and work together to unlock all of the garages and trucks.Is it worth $30?If you've ever wanted a free-roaming, off-road game with no timers or vehicles that require hours upon hours of grinding to unlock, then it's a solid price point.The long versionSpinTires has not changed very much since the demo release a couple of years ago. What you get in the released game is multiplayer, 5 new maps, half-a-dozen or so new trucks, new addons for the trucks, one objective to strive for (lumber transport) and some garages to unlock that are places around the map.Multiplayer is probably the biggest addition to the game which gives it some longevity. It's a basic lobby system where the game creator becomes the host of the game. While this works OK with your friends, it falls down when you join a random game. Unfortunately, all of your hard work will be undone as soon as the game host wants to leave. There's no saving, there's no swapping hosts or log out timers. It's just a sudden, and jarring disconnect from that game. The best advice would be to organise your own group of friends to play the game with.The multiplayer chat is very basic and somewhat buggy. The default key for chat is Y, and sometimes when you're typing out a message, the chat bar will randomly disappear. Also, pressing Y to initiate chat will stop your truck. This can be very frustrating when you want to simply type ""Yes"" or ""Thanks"" and your truck stops dead. Opening the map also does this and is just as frustrating. There is no minimap and the compass is pretty useless. You really need the map to navigate efficiently, but doing this will also slow you down since it stops you in your tracks. A minimap would be ideal, or an option to have a transparent map overlay showing while you drive.The next major additions are the maps and the trucks. The 5 maps included are all the same size, each with it's own theme. Volcano, The Plains, The Hill, etc, are all what they say. However, all the maps are just muddy tracks and lots of trees. They all look the same in colouring, textures and details. The short view distance and draw distance do nothing to help the maps look any different from one another and if you were put in a randome spot on each map, the likely hood that you could which map it is would be pretty high.The trucks are all highly detailed and functional. There are some awesome addons for the trucks, particularly the crane which would have to be the best. You can fully operate the crane to pick up logs and load them into another truck. You can operate stabilizer bars to give your truck that extra stability it needs. The crane has full movement up and down, in and out and is trully a great addition. Log trailers are also pretty cool, adding a whole new level of skill required to take them through the tracks to a lumber yard. Once you load up a log trailer, you can immediately tell that you're carrying a lot of weight. The trailer is prone to tippping over a lot, so you have to drive slowly and skillfully. Reversing trailers has never been a strong point of mine in real life and I'm just as bad in SpinTires! Oh yeah, the trucks sound pretty good too.The damage model is nice, but can be a little unpredictable and I think the damage model needs to be tweaked down a bit. It's very easy to damage your truck by hitting a bump in the road a bit fast. Sure, it's not ideal to go too fast on a track, but you should hardly take 50 damage. Damage seems to be hit and miss. Sometimes, you can drive into a tree and take no damage. Other times, you'll take damage. Sometimes it's minor, like say 2 damage. Other times it's 20 or more. It's all a bit too random and I really can't figure it out.Mud hasn't changed since the demo except that there is more of it. It still looks like brown chunky polygons when it's churned up by your wheels and sometimes I think that it looks a little worse in the released version than it did in the demo. That's not confirmed though. Graphic anomolies aside, the mud is awesome. Never has a driving game done mud like this. Well, there was that one game that was severely disappointing in the end, but I wont mention any Off Road Drive games here. I'm really greatful that Oovee coded the winch into the game because far out, you'll need it to get out of the mud at times. Only the biggest and baddest trucks will drive straight through it but anything else, you'll have to be careful in which line you take. If you're in the Rover, your best bet is too hug the sides where there are plenty of trees to help you winch too.  If you tackle the middle of the muddy tracks, you'll most likely need a friend with you to help pull you out!There's also water to contend with. One of the maps, The River, has.. would you believe it, a large river running through it, separating the map in two halves. Inevitably, you're going to have to cross it. Well, not have too, but want too! It's pretty awesome. The current is strong and if your truck goes too far under water, she'll suck in a few cylinders of water and sieze up. In reality, your truck just takes damage to the point where it no longer functions. It's nice though, it really adds a sense of urgency to get across. It's probably one of the only times where your butt grips your chair in the game.The controls are standard fair. Keyboard and Mouse, or, Xbox 360 gamepad. There is no steering wheel support at present, but Oovee have seen the requests for it and I believe they are looking at adding support later on. There doesn't seem to be any rebinding of the gamepad buttons allowed yet. Hopefully, this will be patched in. Currently, if you're using the Xbox gamepad, your also using the mouse and the keyboard, too. Thats 3 peripherals folks! Yep. It's awkward and unintuitive but that's the design. Ideally, you would play SpinTires with keyboard and mouse only, as then you can do everything fairly easily. But I love kicking back with the gamepad and being able to finely adjust my steering with the thumbstick. Where it becomes clunky is, I have to put down my gamepad and use the mouse to operate the UI. So if I'm stuck, I have to put the gamepad down, grab the mouse, click the screen to get the cursor, click advanced, click a winch point on my truck, click a winch point on a tree/truck, then press 'F' to winch in (because I cannot bind winch in to the gamepad) and then, if I need to steer while winching, I have to try and grab the game pad and manouver with it awkwardly while holding F. Phew. Again, hopefully they patch this with another, more intuitive solution.The camera can, and will be, annoying. The camera.. works. Some people like it, others hate it. I hate it. The camera can pan around your vehicle to get that view you want, but it also swivels unecessarily and can create more aggrivation than its worth.  I'd like to see some standard camera presets, like Chase, Top, Bumper/Bonnet, Side etc, as well as a free cam option where I can position the camera where I want to, and lock it if need be. That could easily be bound to the left thumbstick click down button. A lot of people want a cockpit view. It's going to be a while before we get a cockpit view, but how about a bonnet cam in the meantime?Modding this game is where it will be at. The demo saw many, many different vehicle mods added to it and also some terrains. Currently, while you can mod the release version, it will probably be incompatible with multiplayer and Steam. Oovee have said that they are going to work on making mods compatible so that will be awesome.For $30, it's great!			"

												I've never had so much fun driving so slowly.It's difficult to put my finger on exactly why I enjoy this game so much.  My wife thinks I'm crazy for playing a game consisting entirely of driving trucks through the mud. Even my gamer buddies raise an eyebrow when I get excited about beating a map or figuring out some new strategy. All I can say is ""play it and you'll understand."" I paid full price for Spintires, and it's worth every penny to me. The gameplay is satisfying, slow-paced, and yet still challenging. The graphics are beautiful, and I have only run into a couple bugs. Also, the developers seem to be extremely committed to supporting this game with patches and new content. The only negative I have found is that there is a pretty steep learning curve getting started. However, between the game manual and some of the guides here on steam, you'll get the hang of it in no time. I would highly recommend this game.			"

												What a great game! Got about 26 hours of time on it and still loving it. It's an easy game to get the hang of if you use the bigger D or E type trucks and once you learn how to handle the hills and mud try out the type B and C trucks for a real challenge. I never thought I would have this much fun delivering lumber lol :D . The only complaint I have is it needs more maps. If you get the tech demo the modding community has a bunch but this version of the game needs some with multiplayer support. Some people find the camera hard to use but if you use an xbox controller to play and the mouse to move the camera its pretty easy to navigate.			"

												this game is a very fun game in many ways. it has realistic physics and terrain including how the mud squishes to the side when run over and the trucks are very realistic as well with the models and sounds and how there will be mud and water stains depending on what the truck has gone through. it has levels that take time and new ways to travel. the trucks are customizable which is very cool and in multiplayer it is fun working as a team with others. winching your truck out of a mess or somebody elses out is realistic and it gives a hint on what logging is live for the transport drivers. this i would assume takes place during the getting out of the forest stage during transport. the vehicles that work the best offroading in my opinion are the C-4320 or Ural 4320, C6520 or Kamaz 6520, C-255 or KRAZ 255, D-537 or MAZ 537, E-7310 or MAZ 7310 and the vehicles with a bit of trouble are the B-130 or ZIl 130 and the A-469 or UAZ 469. there are some negatives though but not many. some of the physics are glitchy like some vehicles are too top heavy and the tires will sometimes get stuck. another thing is a way to mod the game which as far as i am concerned is unknown. but there is mores positives then negatives and i definitly recommend this game.

												Overall I enjoyed this game, however the game doesnt feel complete. The graphics are very good and the terrain deformation is second to none. The game also has good audio and physics for a driving sim. What really brings the game down is that it feels like a glorified tech demo. the camera is awkward and can be frustrating, and there is only one real objective; delivering lumber, and beyond that the game does little to keep you intertained, and has very little replay value. The game does feature 5 maps, however as you play through each one you will notice much of the terrain has been copy pasted several times. This is annoying because the maps really are not that big and you will notice when you see the same mud hole in four different places on the same map (really devs?). This game feels like its still in early access and for $30 you would expect a complete game.            For offroad enthusists and people who enjoy truck sims you will feel right at home being stuck in a mud pitt deep in the woods, but to the casual gamer this will a frustrating and annoying experience.

												Wonderful offroading mudfest ""simulator"" where you explore maps, unlock vehicles and haul logs from point a to b. Best of all, you can drive around with your friends and help them out of by winching them to solid ground. Initial version is slightly bugged as you cannot see your friends non-active vehicles and sometimes one of the tires fall through the map floor - On Coast map even after the first patch where it should have been fixed. There is also no way to save progress of multiplayer games. Still, these issues do not stop me from coming back to mudding after a while. recommended for hardcore offroaders, not for speed freaks.BR, --Jones			"

												The point of Spintires is to deliver logs. That's it. Logs. You know what? It's AMAZING!!! The textures are highly detailed, the physics are suberb and you have a whole garage of Russian military vehicles to aid you in your mission to deliver logs across all terrains, crossing rivers, mudpits, scaling rocky cliffs. What's more, player's attitudes toward this are fantastic. Never have I met a nicer bunch of people than on a Spintires multiplayer game, where after completing the map everyone thanked me just for hosting the server! Another time I played with three Russians, not speaking a word of their language, and we all knew exactly what to do, helping each other out of the stickiest situations. Competitive gaming is okay as far as I'm concerned but nothing feels better than helping your peers cooperatively. Buy it now.			"

												If you are into some muddy terrain driving, this is a game for you!Get a gamepad (I'm using an Xbox controller) or a steering wheel for best feeling. That will make you use the analog inputs that make the game more responsive and do what you want. Not what your keyboard makes you to. ^^pThis game only gets better for every update the developers do!They push in a lot of work on small things that really make it feel and behave like it do IRL.

												This is a very interesting game. Definitely very accurate and detailed on the physics side of things; tires adapt to the surroundings, terrain deforms, trees bend, the truck suspension moves realistically; I would expect to see this leve lof realism on a real vehicle, not a virtual one. Great job on that!SpinTires is certainly not an easy game, because you constantly have to look where you're going and plan ahead. Depending on the route taken, fuel consumption needs to considered and active diff locks and all wheel drive certainly increases that amount of fuel used. Given the detail I would definitely rank it among the best simulation games I have ever played so far.The overall gameplay is based on unlocks on a specific map, and there are a number of ways to complete the objectives and side objectives. You can rescue a stranded truck by supplying it with fuel, or ""teleport"" it back to a garage; at least in non-hardcore mode. That's no fun though. Much more rewarding to fight your way to the truck with a cistern trailer full of fuel. You can also unlock additional garages that can serve as outposts along the way by supplying parts (""garage points"") which gives you more places to repair damage on your vehicles.The main objectives right now are hauling logs. Short, medium, or large ones, depending on your truck and specs. The longer the logs, the more points you get. Hopefully more objectives will be added in future, and ways to repair the roads etc. There are plenty of awesome suggestions in the developer's forums, including for vehicles with tracks!I definitely do agree with others though as far as the camera is concerned. It definitely needs improvement. It gets stuck at odd angles and it's almost hard work having to coerce it into moving around the vehicle you're driving; especially in tough spots. It's OK most of the time, but there are some situations that require a more precise camera perspective, and that's almost impossible to achieve.I can thoroughly recommend it though, and if you like simulation games of any kind, then this is for you. The price is also fair considering the fun you get out of it!Update FEB 2015:I finally had some time trying Spintires out again for a bit, I'm really positively surprised with the changes. Graphical improvements, additional trailers, the horns are funny and expanding sound waves a great idea. The changes mud physics make it a little more difficult, and so does the fueling which is no longer fully possible at a garage. It adds depth. I'm particularly fond of the trailers, since it now doesn't take endless trips anymore to unlock a garage in single-player. Good work overall.I still wish those ""fog of war"" tornadoes were replaced by something else, and that there were more objectives, but all in good time.			"

												This game is quite enjoyable and has a lot of potential. One of the major things I believe should be implemented into the game is mods such as 4x4, etc. which should be enabled to be installed into the game without it stopping the gaining of achievements and game progression. I am aware that mods can be installed, but for the people like myself that aren't too computer inclined (but enjoy playing games) should be able to access an 'official' selection of 4x4 vehicles within the game that can be easily installed/removed and be used in the full game and are able to make progress, unlock achievements and be 'multiplayer'.It is an excellent thing to hear animals when driving through the bush/wilderness, this is another aspect I believe would be a great addition to the surroundings and scenery. Even if there is no real intreaction with the animals, as we can hear them, it would be fantastic to see them (run accross a river or track, wild boar wallowing in mud, bear catching fish, fish).My biggest recomendation for this game is that mods be available for multiplayer, be official, be easier to install (ex. in Portal 2 - levels/mods can be installed quickly and easily from within the game) and lastly to have some wildlife to really give this game a realistic feel to it.Overall, Fantastic game and hope the developers continue to upgrade and improve this game to full potential.(would recommend game to anyone)			"

												SpinTires is not a game for the faint of heart. When you first load into the map you are greeted with a few cold-war era trucks that you can customise. Depending on the truck, you can add anything from bigger tires to log trailers. Want to be a support vehicle? That's fine too! Add a fuel cistern or a repair attachment! Where this game really shines is the multiplayer. There is little to no lag and even the devs say that the game was made for multiplayer. You can have up to four players, which means a lot of opportunities. Teamwork is the aim of the game here! So load up those logs, get through that mud and deliver that lumber!			"

Runs on max at a steady 60 fps on a GTX 670 @ 1080p, with 50% power to spare, Trucks take damage, and consume fuel. You can install a utility addon for mobile repairs, or a fuel cistern for re-fueling in the field.			"

												One of the best hardcore simulators in offroad driving. The physics are without a doubt the star of the show, but it has some pretty graphical effects to go along with it. The game was off to a rough beginning as far as content updates during Early Access, but legal issues were cleared up and the team has been pushing out several major updates as of late with many bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and optimizations. Speaking of, this game runs butter smooth on even modest hardware. Thanks to recently added Steam Workshop support, modders have starting throwing in custom vehicles to spice up the fun. The game has a funky camera that takes a little getting used to but after a short learning curve, you'll have it under wraps. This game is best enjoyed with 3 other friends in coop. Stop scrolling and just buy it.			"

												   Since Spintires was just on the internet as a tech demo long before ever getting on steam, i think this game has really come together quite well. Other then the fact the Developers seem to always be busy on vacations or in meetings, the rare occasion we get updates like the more recent one which added workshop support for vehicles is pretty good. They need to really get more maps included and workshop support for the modded maps asap, because this game's limited choice of 6 maps does get old rather quickly. The online multiplayer is pretty solid but it's menus are still very bare bones, and frustrating to use because you cannot name servers, and in general it just doesn't look very appealing. As far as networking goes, that is also something that's fairly broken and in about 30% of the times joining a server you will time-out or just freeze before loading the persons game.  All in all this game still rivals every other game for its mud physics which are quite amazing really and there's no other game on the market that pulls it off so perfectly. I really hope Rockstar games has seen this and taken note, games like gta could really use this procedual mud physics. Overall ill still give this game a 7/10 , as there's still much that's been promised and not fulfilled.			"

												I find it strange that I like this game as much as I do. After all I get easily frustrated and angry when I get my car stuck in the snow. But I find SPINTIRES delightful and satisfying from how much hard work it forces you to put into it.SPINTIRES is a game that puts you in the middle of some isolated forest or marsh, and your goal is to deliver logs from the lumber yard to the mill. Sounds straightforward.However, the terrain will prove to be your biggest obstacle. Most 'roads' are nothing more than muddy trenches, destinations sit at the top of steep hills, and it will become necessary to haul logs and trailers through rivers...which may end in disaster. Fortunately, you have some pretty hefty trucks at your disposal, a couple of which can barrel over smaller trees with no problem.The aforementioned satisfaction comes from trudging through the mud and reaching your destination with your load intact. There's a wonderful sense of accomplishment when you get your vehicle stuck and manage to winch yourself to a tree and pull yourself out.The physics SPINTIRES is something to boast about. The terrain changes under your tires, depending on the vehicle you're operating; mud gets kicked up, roads get chewed up, small bridges might collapse under your weight.You can play more casually by respawning your vehicle to an unlocked garage or not have to worry about shifting gears manually. But there is a hardcore mode where respawning is disabled, providing a more realistic experience; if your vehicle is stuck submerged in a river, you need a bigger truck to pull it out.Even so, at the start of each level your traveller's map will be covered in black spots. To uncover these, for better or for worse, you need to drive to the source of these spots to remove the cloaking. This promotes more aggressive exploration, though this is more of a negative than a positive for some players, as there is no option to have the entire map visible.There is a multiplayer option in SPINTIRES as well as steering wheel support, though there are many people who have had issues with both lately. Briefly glancing through forums, there might be some fixes that can clear up these issues, but hopefully the developers will look into the problems quickly and patch them out.All in all, I highly recommend SPINTIRES. I've sunk a lot of hours into delivering logs across a marsh and walked away feeling satisfied and very entertained. Sounds strange, but, if you give it a try, you might be surprised at how fun it can be.			"

												Spintires is unique experience. It has some flaws, still though very possibly to be fixed in future patches. I had played tech demo before. I liked it, and it made me buy SpinTires at the moment I saw it was released. I highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in off-road driving games or off-road generally! Trust me, you can't find another one like this. At least yet ;)			"

												A dungeon crawler where the enemy is the very earth beneath you. Experincial learning is a major motive for continued play. Another is the rewarding feeling of organically working against the game and acheiving a goal. Problems extend naturally into smaller and smaller sub-goals, giving the player a constant feeling of accomplishment in his work.			"

												Overall I enjoyed this game, however the game doesnt feel complete. The graphics are very good and the terrain deformation is second to none. The game also has good audio and physics for a driving sim. What really brings the game down is that it feels like a glorified tech demo. the camera is awkward and can be frustrating, and there is only one real objective; delivering lumber, and beyond that the game does little to keep you intertained, and has very little replay value. The game does feature 5 maps, however as you play through each one you will notice much of the terrain has been copy pasted several times. This is annoying because the maps really are not that big and you will notice when you see the same mud hole in four different places on the same map (really devs?). This game feels like its still in early access and for $30 you would expect a complete game.            For offroad enthusists and people who enjoy truck sims you will feel right at home being stuck in a mud pitt deep in the woods, but to the casual gamer this will a frustrating and annoying experience.

												Brings totally hilarious experiences in multiplayer, can't count moments, when i went short on breath from laughing. Just doing something aimlessly, can quickly become story of few drunk russian drivers in Siberian Taiga. It's sandbox evolution, to separate genre - mudbox.As downside, in first hours, you stumble on repetition in maps (COPY>PASTE literally) and lack of content (more activities, vehicles, maps would be preferable), so question, how long it will bring joy. And poor support for mods in multiplayer!! this alone is substantial for longevity of such game.So, in one word - GREAT! but looks more like extended tech demo, not a full featured game.			"

												this review was a thumbs up at first but i can't have that anymore, the drama between OOVEE's DEV and OOVEE them self is killing this game slowly, with a game that had barely any problems and now has a SH!T ton of problems like textures on maps not loading in right ground tearing making holes in the maps, physics for the trucks sometimes exploding out of no where and the truck models are not unique you can find them on turbosquid and the obsurd amount of copy and paste within the maps (this was a problem at launch but it never changed) some features have been stripped since release and so on, and now the game is WAY to easy (when the motto for this game was ""spintires the ultimate offroad challenge"") now its just the challenge of not falling asleep when you realize this game is way to easy for what it is trying to be, the updates we are promised are NEVER delivered and when they are they are usually like 7 months to a year behind schedule (and no im not exaggerating when i say that) and the game will get dull fast if you don't mod it, the only thing keeping this game alive anymore is the AMAZING community that makes us the awesome vehicle mods and map mods (the map editor is a crash fest as well btw) with that said here is my pros and cons.pros+awesome community+a SH!T ton of mods including vehicles and maps+awesome mud simulation (ruts in the terrain, flying chunks of mud, mud can be collected on the vehicle)+easy to modcons (oh boy)-repetitive maps with a SH!T ton of copy and paste-graphics look like they are from 2008-all of the 6x6 vehicles feel the same-the level of detail is P!ss poor-physics can explode on trucks sometimes-updates for the game are not frequent-game feels unfinished-lack of content-vehicle models are not unique (you can find them on turbosquid)-some graphic settings do not work, SSAO, highest setting for particals do not work (as of this review)-tire tracks, mud trails from tires, and mud chunks collecting on tires are not working (as of this review)-lack of variety in maps (tree here, mud hole here, rock there, water here, rinse and repeat. did i mention copy and paste?)-camera is awful, auto zooms when you don't need it to and its not that great in general-can't use map mods online without community work arounds (we where promised this would be a feature but was never added)-lack of camera views, no cabin view, only hood cam or follow cam-no variety of game modes, only log hauling (again thank god for mods that give you more options)-game is too easy now (spintires the ultimate hold W and win challenge) i'll update this when its worth a thumbs up or need to add or fix something in the cons, but if you plan on modding this game go for it, if not, don't bother with this game right now.my score without mods3/10my score with mods8.5/10			"

												I love off roading. I love trucks. And this combines the two.In short, this is like ECW Euro Truck Simulator. Like an extreme version of Euro Truck Simulator, but only setting in Russia.The game mechanics are phenomenal, with all the mud and different kind of terrain physics very well simulated.The objective is simple: pick up lumber at point A and deliver at point B. Only there are hills, rivers, and all kinds of natural obstacles that will have you sweating to keep your load and truck intact.Got stuck? Winch your way out!

												This game is quite enjoyable and has a lot of potential. One of the major things I believe should be implemented into the game is mods such as 4x4, etc. which should be enabled to be installed into the game without it stopping the gaining of achievements and game progression. I am aware that mods can be installed, but for the people like myself that aren't too computer inclined (but enjoy playing games) should be able to access an 'official' selection of 4x4 vehicles within the game that can be easily installed/removed and be used in the full game and are able to make progress, unlock achievements and be 'multiplayer'.It is an excellent thing to hear animals when driving through the bush/wilderness, this is another aspect I believe would be a great addition to the surroundings and scenery. Even if there is no real intreaction with the animals, as we can hear them, it would be fantastic to see them (run accross a river or track, wild boar wallowing in mud, bear catching fish, fish).My biggest recomendation for this game is that mods be available for multiplayer, be official, be easier to install (ex. in Portal 2 - levels/mods can be installed quickly and easily from within the game) and lastly to have some wildlife to really give this game a realistic feel to it.Overall, Fantastic game and hope the developers continue to upgrade and improve this game to full potential.(would recommend game to anyone)			"

												This is a very interesting game. Definitely very accurate and detailed on the physics side of things; tires adapt to the surroundings, terrain deforms, trees bend, the truck suspension moves realistically; I would expect to see this leve lof realism on a real vehicle, not a virtual one. Great job on that!SpinTires is certainly not an easy game, because you constantly have to look where you're going and plan ahead. Depending on the route taken, fuel consumption needs to considered and active diff locks and all wheel drive certainly increases that amount of fuel used. Given the detail I would definitely rank it among the best simulation games I have ever played so far.The overall gameplay is based on unlocks on a specific map, and there are a number of ways to complete the objectives and side objectives. You can rescue a stranded truck by supplying it with fuel, or ""teleport"" it back to a garage; at least in non-hardcore mode. That's no fun though. Much more rewarding to fight your way to the truck with a cistern trailer full of fuel. You can also unlock additional garages that can serve as outposts along the way by supplying parts (""garage points"") which gives you more places to repair damage on your vehicles.The main objectives right now are hauling logs. Short, medium, or large ones, depending on your truck and specs. The longer the logs, the more points you get. Hopefully more objectives will be added in future, and ways to repair the roads etc. There are plenty of awesome suggestions in the developer's forums, including for vehicles with tracks!I definitely do agree with others though as far as the camera is concerned. It definitely needs improvement. It gets stuck at odd angles and it's almost hard work having to coerce it into moving around the vehicle you're driving; especially in tough spots. It's OK most of the time, but there are some situations that require a more precise camera perspective, and that's almost impossible to achieve.I can thoroughly recommend it though, and if you like simulation games of any kind, then this is for you. The price is also fair considering the fun you get out of it!Update FEB 2015:I finally had some time trying Spintires out again for a bit, I'm really positively surprised with the changes. Graphical improvements, additional trailers, the horns are funny and expanding sound waves a great idea. The changes mud physics make it a little more difficult, and so does the fueling which is no longer fully possible at a garage. It adds depth. I'm particularly fond of the trailers, since it now doesn't take endless trips anymore to unlock a garage in single-player. Good work overall.I still wish those ""fog of war"" tornadoes were replaced by something else, and that there were more objectives, but all in good time.			"

												This is the first game in a long time to make me genuinely happy. This game will give you flashbacks to being stuck in the mud, digging through sludge, and snagging up the winch cables as you bust your rump to get unstuck. The game is not with out quirks and a few quick searchs on youtube you'll find that the physics needs more than just a bit of a tweak (search tug of war spintires).  But it is spectacularly beautiful; the lighting alone is impressive, but when you start to see the way the ground moves and the mud splatter interacts with the trucks you're just awed.  Also the steam on the engine is an impressive touch of realism that many other games miss out on when fording a river. The games sole compromise to awesomeness at the moment is the camera.  It takes some time to get used to, and really requires the user to make very slow movements to remain in control of.  The number of maps thus far is as limited as some of the trucks but considering the game is still under development this and the winching abilities can be given some slack until the game is closer to being completely finished as the updates keep coming. I'd highly recommend the game, specially if you got some friends to help you sludge your way through the mud on multiplayer coops.			"

												I wouldn't describe this as a racing game, but loosely as a off-road driving sim with a great gimmick placed in Russia's wilderness. It has interesting ground deformation that simualtes mud better than any other game I've played.Even this early on this game is shining with potentail. Currently we only have 4 objectives per map; deliver lumber to the sawmills, uncloak the map, discover the extra trucks, and unlock all garages. And five mostly unique maps, I don't fully know how unique because after 40 hours of play I'm still playing around on the Coast map. As the game stands now I'd say it is well worth $30 but the Devs have proven diligent on this game and have delivered on thier promises thus far. They have promised more maps, more trucks, and more objectives. PLUS they are leaving the game open to the modding community. In just the tech demo alone modders created huge libraries of well built mods. The bad, the camera controls are wonky and you can never seem to get the right view, the controls are rigid with only keyboard or xbox controls available (no steering wheels,) there are still some bugs with how collisions work and how the renders and with the latest hotpatch the biggest bug of getting your wheels stuck under the ground mesh seems solidly fixed.I foresee myself logging a lot of hours on this game "

												This game is very good. I enjoy its physics capability and its amazing landscape. The only thing I don't like about the game is when i wanted to access the new vehicles in the beta tab in properties it wan't there. Apart from that that I really like this game. I recommend it for people who like adventures.			"

												Good game based on a groundbreaking engine, but will never leave early access. Though they call it finished the company broke off with the only developer years ago and the result is sold as a full game.I recommend to buy for 5$ or so and enjoy it while it lasts and don't get too invested, because at some point you may realize this could hav become a genre defining classic if people had just not been so selfish.

												This game is hands down the best offroad simulation game I have ever played. The main reason is because of the technology used in the game to simulate the terrain. The ground contiually morphs as you drive through it and if you are by some body of water the grooves left from your vehicle will even fill up with some water. Playing this game really makes me feel like I am out in the mud and ""spinning my tires"". I bought this game because I enjoyed the tech demo and when I heard they were going to have multiplayer I knew I had to have it. I like playing with friends and family while sort of playing follow the leader as we take random trails throughout the map and wench each other out when needed. With all of this being said there are still some downsides. The first big one for me is the lack of objectives or content. Right now all there really is to do in the game is uncloak areas, unlock vehicles by driving up to them, and hauling logs from one spot to a next. I personally like to have some sort of progression system where I start off with maybe a couple vehicles and then complete some tasks where I then have to pay to unlock other vehicles or upgrades for vehicles. From there I would like to be able to complete different tasks such as maybe rescuing a stuck vehicle or moving other forms of freight. The camera right now is also very annoying but the developers have already mentioned that they will fix it. Obviosuly the game just released so there will be much more content coming out. In its current state it is very fun and I believe it will continue to get better.			"

												This is a great simulator game.  I've found hours of ""getting out of school work"" used to better myself at this game.  The first time I played the game, I would get stuck or flip or just end up lost and have to restart.  Not a big deal.  The moment people see a simulator, they think, ""I can do this easy, no problem.""  Well, there is a learning curve, just with every other game out there.  Its a lot different then a lot of other games out there, and requires a lot more time to both A: get to know the game, and B: play the game.  It is slow, I'll be honest.  Most of the time, your bouncing around in a truck in the middle of nowhere in 1st gear, slowly driving through mud and water, conpleting objectives.  It can get boring, yes, but that is the beauty of multiplayer and mods.  There is a large community online that makes new vehicles, features, maps, and add-ons for the games. Multiplayer is something I've recently found.  My internet wouldn't support multiplayer for the longest time, and now it does.  Multiplayer is just like Singleplayer; same maps, same vehicles, same mud and water.  But, multiplayer just feels different.  It feels better knowing your not alone for the most part.  If you stray away from your group of intrepid truck drivers, then it starts to feel like single player again, but that is just the nature of the game.  Overall, this is a great game.			"

												""Boldly go where no truck has gone before....and get stuck in the mud""While the game clearly needs more content and objectives for players to do, it is already a great off-road game and we haven't had too many of those in recent years. Physics, animations and visuals are impressive for an indie title and it is comfortable to play with Xbox 360 pad. It is also a proper simulator game and if you don't treat it as such, expect to get stuck over and over again. User interface and expecially the camera are not great, but you'll get used to them.Playing this game also makes you appreciate tarmac and bridges so much more.			"

												This is a silly game and a lot of fun, getting stuck with your buddies and then winching each other to freedom is very satisfying.  It can be hard to find a public server to play on that doesn’t lose all the people after about five minutes, but when you do, it’s great fun.  It really needs multiplayer saves though.  It can be a shame to put so many hours into a multiplayer game, only to lose it because you run out of time to play that day, or suffer a crash.			"

												Mechanical beasts in the Russian wilderness, what more can you ask for??I love this game and my money was well spent. This game is beautiful graphically and im very impressed with the overall phyics in the game. This game is incrediblly fun and extremely addictive! Especially with friends in multiplayer mode where the more challenging side of the game appears.But inspite of all this no games are perfect..... What ive found wrong with this game in my opinion is the lack trucks (sure there are countless addons for the truck which make them different evrytime) the game reallly needs to add about 10 more different base trucks.  The view when driving the trucks can get very annoying somtimes and i wish they would have added a first person view. Some of the controls are also quite ""clunky"" and i found myslef having to use an Xbox 360 contoller to make life easier. Also this game lacks in updates which is very disapointing.Overall I recommend you buy this game especially in a sale, youll get your moneys worth.			"

												If you love big trucks and offroad driving for the sake of overcoming obstacles and heavy terrain with average speed of 100 meters / minute, you will love this game! If you admire old solid trucks from Soviet era that you can fix with just a hammer, it's a cherry on top. In contrast, if you are after BAJA race-like game then this is not what you're looking for (at least till modding community gets its hands on it properly).Lookup some gameplay videos on youtube, e.g.

 If you like what you see when others play it, you will enjoy the game.-------------Some details:It is quite difficult even on ""casual"" settings and you need to think before you drive into something. It's prudent to check the game manual or some tutorials to find out how to use all wheels drive, differential lock and winch, otherwise you may end up stuck 10 seconds after leaving your garage.Yes, the camera sucks and could do with some tweaks at least (which devs already promised to do), but even in it's current form you can live with it. It takes some getting used to but in the end you will learn how to tame it (I have tried just keyboard and mouse controls though).It lasts to be an exciting challenge for some 15-20 hours of singleplayer (roughly the time it takes to complete all maps at causal diff.), after that it can get repetitive for some people (it's always: explore map + unlock goodies -> find easiest route -> make 2-4 trips with logs). I suppose you could repeat all that on Hard, but given that you will know the maps already and remember how to avoid mud traps... Hopefully we will see some more content added and also stuff from modding community that will extend the playability.As for multiplayer, I haven't tried myself yet but from what I have seen on youtube it can be even more fun.Other things that are slightly annoing but probably won't spoil your first 20 hours:- You can't save progress on each map independently (devs promised to fix this though)- Once you finish a map it resets and is ""cloaked"" again- Multiplayer doesn't sync all sounds (will hopefully be fixed in future updates)			"

												Really a great game that is largely overlooked, moslty I suppose,  because of it's genre. The graphics and mechanics are truly superb! There are a great manifold of trucks to choose from (and not just stock trucks, but astonishing user additons from the workshop). The only negative to report really is it can get repetitious after a while. Playing MP, though, can diminish this factor.			"

												CANT SEE ♥♥♥♥!!!!Okay leme just say this first... The game looks BRILLIANT! the physics are top notch! the graphics are amazing! the lighting adds to that! and on the most part this game just looks like something unreal!Not heres the reason why I do not reccomend this game... I CANT SEE ANYTHING!!!Basically the camera is worse than what you get from an early 90's 3d platformer but loads worse!That big vehicle on screen that your driving... the camera is either like ""il sit myself directly above the vehicle"" or ""il zoom right into the vehicle on one part""Its pretty much impossible to get that perfect camera angle to see what your doing, its on rails and you cannot control its height or pan, the game does that all for you and jesus did they screw up! When your driving around in a forest you need to be able to view your road ahead of you so you can adjust your driving to suit the terrain that is coming up! but the camera in this game makes this literally IMPOSSIBLE! lets say I get stuck on something like a chopped down tree trunk on my front bumper and i cant move forward cus of it, I gotta look around the truck to see whats in the way... but god damn I am having to fight the camera.All in all Its actually better to rear view your vehicle with it following the camera as you drive, then at least you can see what the front of the vehicle is up to... also NO FIRST PERSON VIEW!!! well as far as I could tell I dont see any way I can make it FPV... cus uno driving games REALLY hate the simulation feel.Final verdict... I enjoyed the game up to the point where I had to make tricky manuvers cus I couldnt make the neccesay checking of blind spots before making a 3 point turn... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW WAIT UNTILL THE DEVS FIX THE CAMERA!			"

Sure it isn't a deeply featured game (take this and that, from here to there, get stuck a lot), but the beauty is in its simplicity. I have almost completed all objectives in the Coast map on hardcore difficulty, and three of us managed to complete all objectives in the River map in much less time on normal difficulty. There are still many maps which offer small variations in difficulty if I should wish to play more. At the moment I actually feel pretty satisfied and could walk away without regret. I purchased for $10 when it was on sale. I'm not sure I would spend more than $15.My favorite thing so far has been recovering spilled logs. When I was still getting the hang of things, I tipped over a few times, which can cause a load of logs to be dropped. Some trucks have a crane attachment that lets you pick up the logs and sort of place them back in the truck bed or within the cart, and once you have enough of them alligned you can recover the load and continue on your way to the objective.My least favorite thing has to be the camera. It feels like leftover code from when the software was intended as a tech showcase. It is very impractical when you're actually trying to survey the environment.			"

												Incredibly fun off-roader. Play it in Hardcore mode and with friends to get the most value.This is a VERY slow burn, you can save your singleplayer progress at any point, but clearing each of the six maps can take a few hours solo (or 40 minutes in co-op).Very, very pretty too, given how small the install footprint is.

												Really a great game that is largely overlooked, moslty I suppose,  because of it's genre. The graphics and mechanics are truly superb! There are a great manifold of trucks to choose from (and not just stock trucks, but astonishing user additons from the workshop). The only negative to report really is it can get repetitious after a while. Playing MP, though, can diminish this factor.			"

												""Boldly go where no truck has gone before....and get stuck in the mud""While the game clearly needs more content and objectives for players to do, it is already a great off-road game and we haven't had too many of those in recent years. Physics, animations and visuals are impressive for an indie title and it is comfortable to play with Xbox 360 pad. It is also a proper simulator game and if you don't treat it as such, expect to get stuck over and over again. User interface and expecially the camera are not great, but you'll get used to them.Playing this game also makes you appreciate tarmac and bridges so much more.			"

												FANTASTIC GAME!Please don't listen to the people that are complaining about this game, they really are just bellyaching about things that there is no point in bellyaching about.This game truly is quite amazing, in many ways:-PhysicsThis game's physics engine is ASTOUNDING. Everyting in the world is realistic; squishy mud, rolling rocks, bending shrubs and even trees that sway, wobble, and break! Yes, you heard me right, when you crash into trees, they actually move! I don't know why other games have stupid static trees that have no affect when you crash into them. The physics are definitely what makes this game amazing, but that is not all.-TrucksAlthough there are only seven trucks in the game, they are all extremely well modeled and detailed, and each truck is very different. It is a great experience discovering all the trucks on the map, and then learning the best uses for each one. Plus the trucks are all Russian, so, yeah, automattically amazing.-MapsThe five maps on the game are all very diverse. Five may seem like a small number, but each one of the maps is HUGE. Also, each map is very different to explore. There are many different buildings, landmarks, and natural landforms on every map. The ""cloaking"" system on the maps adds a unique challenge to the game. The only unfortunate thing about the maps is that only one map can be save =d at a time, so if you start a new map, everything you did on the other map will be erased. Hopefully this will be changed soon.-MultiplayerI didn't go into this game expecting great multiplayer. I was pleasantly surprised, though, when I saw how well the multiplayer worked. It was very easy to do, and it makes the game even better playing with other people. This game is very good when teamwork is put into effect; each person can try to conquer a different task on the map, and if somebody gets stuck in the mud, you can help them by attaching your winch to them. Playing Spintires on multiplayer is just a fun and interesting way to collaborate and work together, and believe it or not, it is actually awesome.SUMMARY (TL;DR)Spintires is an amazing offroad driving simulator, with extremely realistic physics, trucks, and maps. It also has great, easy, and fun to use multiplayer. I believe this game is already fantastic, but I do still have high hopes for whatever changes will occur to it in the future!Final Score: 8.9/10			"

So im not surprised that this simulation is too.   Forget about the bad camera or the limited content (Currently), the purpose of a video game is to entertain and I'm very entertained by this one. The developers seem comitted to improving and adding content soon as well, I dont see why you wouldnt reccomend this game to someone intrested in offroad or vehicle simulation games.Verdict: This game is a lot of fun!

Add on top having to wash the ♥♥♥♥♥ all the time and keep it full of gas your adding another $5000+ a year, its not a cheap Hobby.I spent $30 on this game and recieved almost the same experience i was getting in my truck minus the mess and up keep cost. SpinTire comes with 6 Huge open world off road maps, which come with garages, objectives, 7+ Vehicles with customization, and lots of mud! The game physics are damn near perfect, along with amazing graphics its easy to get lost for hours out in the Russian back country.

												MUD.LOTS. OF. MUD.An interesting and conteplative although not very leisurely drive through the countryside of Siberia, in which you are tasked with collecting logs, but the real object seems to be finding creatively desperate measures to avoid becoming mired in, or retrieve vehicles from being stuck in The Mud.Did I mention that there is Mud?Not for impatient people; some areas will require creating a strategy to repair, provide fuel for, and retrieve various trucks which serve different specialized purposes. There will be frustrating moments, as you spend lots of time extracting yourself from Mud.The truck models and rendering are great. The physics and visual effects are also good, especially the deformable terrain (Mud) and destructible small trees, which allows you to feel like you are actually affecting real objects.The current number of maps is small, and once you conquer the rough spots on one map, you will be eager to move to the next, and all of the available maps are soon completed. Hopefullty there will me more in the future.Lots of fun, with Mud.			"

												This game is awesome.  You drive around the deep wilderness in old russian trucks (some of which are very large), carry a ton of logs across the region, and get stuck or run out of fuel.  Rescue yourself with another truck.My favorite moment was when I was far away from the garage.  I was towing a small jeep behind a large truck, and crossing a narrow bridge (over a ~4 meter ditch).  The big truck slipped off the edge of the bridge, fell in the ditch, rolled on it's side, and stalled.I drove the jeep across the bridge, positioned myself behind a tree, and attached the winch to the big truck.  It groaned, and the tree bent backward, but nothing moved.  I jot the gas (tires spinning) and the winch. and the big truck just barely slid down the side of the ditch, and rolled upright.I got in the big truck, started it up, engaged the diff lock and all-wheel drive, and floored it towards the end of the ditch.  I made it near the top, hit the handbrake, and winched myself out.I drove around the edge of the ditch, put the jeep into tow, and adventured on.  Epic.			"

												Ths game is called SpinTires. The most un-misleading title to ever feature in a game, as you quite obviously spend most of your time spinning your tires in a desperate attempt to free yourself without flipping on your side.Don't get me wrong though, this game is, as kids say nowadays, Da Bomb. SpinTires is a decide-your-path-and-see-what-happens kinda game, every turn is a choice of ranging difficulty or length, and one wrong turn can ruin your plan of action.I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a love of offroading, driving, or even just Russian trucks in general.10 out of 10.

Especially when we have been using the same vehicles since the stupid demo and you keep trying to inprove gameplay. Very little things on gameplay... like things most people hardly notice. How about adding mod support or some damn vehicles? And than according to the update new or whatever its called your speaking of a spintires 2 already?

Had to tweak a couple settings in Profiler to make it feel a bit more real, but over all, the wheel feels incredible. Huge fan of iRacing.com, so realistic wheel physics is a must for me and this game nails it in my opinion.Mud, mud, and so much mud! Love it!Single player could use a bit more, but it's great for some mind-numbing entertainment. Just doesn't feel rewarding enough for the grind it takes. Multiplayer is by the far the best part, and most entertaining. Much easier to get stuff done when you have 4 people, of course. This is how the game is supposed to be played, IMO. Maybe an AI option on the Singleplayer in the future? I paid sale price, but after playing it, I probably would have still waited to pay sale price. ;)			"

												This game is awesome. It reminds me a bit of the offroad game ""4x4 Evo"" back in the days.If only every other racing/offroad game would care so much about its mud physics.....It makes alot of fun to reach the other end of the map and try to keep up with your amount of fuel or your allowed damage during driving. If your engine breaks down, no worries there are lots of other car models on the map that can pull you out or maybe your do it yourself by using the winch on a tree. Since i bought it 2 months ago there came like 5 new maps and i think the devs are really caring about their game.However, this is no fast racing or game. Expect some time to pass by to reach your destination. If you are fine with that, you will get a beautiful, relaxing and challenging offroad gamePro:+ sweet graphics+ sweet physics+ sweet cars+ plenty of cars, maps, achievements+ multiplayercons:- camera angle could be better- only 1 objective (currently carrying logs of wood from A to B)			"

												The level of dissapointment I have for this game is unmattched by any other game I own. The worst communication from a game publisher I've ever seen. Ever.This game is infact unfinished. Don't let anyone fool you into beliving it is. It left early access about a year ago, and in that time, more bugs and issues have been made by the very few tiny updates than have been fixed. Then to make things worse, They have gone to extream measures to stop modders from fixing bugs, making maps, add objectives and new trucks. Currently, there is only one objective type, of the many promiced, which is hauling logs. The multiplayer mode is horribly broken and not playble for most players. At this point, the free tech demo is just as playble and has a ton of mods. Don't give OOVEE a single cent. This game has sold so many copies, they could have hired a new tech team from scratch to fix and finish this game and still have their hottubs full of money. They rarely communicate any information other than you will burn in hell for making mods, to the point that the forum mods only apologize for how badly Oovee is handling all this.It would take so little effort from Oovee to fix this game, and their reputation, its insulting. To the point that not only will I never buy another product from them, will never stop telling people to avoid them, but when this company eventually rebrands/renames it self, I will be the first to stand up and be the biggest voice to tell people not buy their games.Oovee, I only hope you go away and never publish another game again.

												I have put 80 hours on this game and havent played it in a month because I can't find a reason to play it. The dev's last post was in late May. ITS AUGUST. The terrain deformation is cool to look at and all, but it just got boring. There are mods, too but they seem to be all a variation of a vehicle every one and their mother has heard of. Unless you enjoy playing a game and then getting bored of it after a while, DON'T BUY IT. It seems that all of the devs have died without a trace.			"

												This game has a great physics engine and digging though the dirt in multiplayer in really fun, But I just can not recommend buying this game for 30 bucks, as it has just 5 maps and it is the same objective on each map.Although the dev(s) promised to deliver content updates soon after release, nothing happened so far. The game was a top-seller in the first weeks after release and the dev(s) must have earned quite a lot of money. Still nothing happens and there is no communication, no sign that anything is going to happen. Until the content of this game remains so little, this game is not worth the money.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game was fun. I've spent hours trying to get my truck through some tough terrain, as well as hauling out friends in the process. Now, you've probably realized that I'm talking in the past tense.Oovee, the company behind this game, has literally done nothing in the past eight months, all the while making promises that didn't become fulfilled. The guy that created the game, Pavel, has literally told players that the company refuses to communicate. They've taken their money and ran. I feel sorry for Pavel, as it's obvious that he wants to take this game somewhere through repeated posts and messages. This game is dead, or at least it's dying. As of typing this, there are less then 400 people playing.Don't get it. Unless something starts happening, don't get it.			"

												Hi I love 4WDing and this game is awesome good job on 1st of a kind too. (First a big THANKYOU to the developers for making it). I do have a couple of ideas i think might be cool. It could be more realistic if u could see out of the cabs of vehicles of course u couldn't use it all the time i know like though water etc. Maybe some other terrain like (Snow,Sand,and if u have heard of Bull-dust) now that's a nightmare. Maybe some seasons or Rain etc. to make it harder at times it is a bit to easy some times. Races round the map for mp. of course a couple more vehicles would be cool maybe a tractor or a light atv. I have played hrs upon hrs off it and love it looking forward to see were u can take it from here and thx agn.			"

												UPDATE: December 2016i update this with a forums post i made, i think it summs up the situation well;""i think we should not project our anger or dislike we have for the publisher(oovee) or the developer(pavel) onto the game.why? cause the game has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with it and is not the games fault, how could it be?the game right now has over 150+ maps available, i guesstimate about 30 or 40 of the maps are high quality, better than stock maps. that is a good ratio.the game has like i dont know many vehicles mods, also many good one and even more bad ones, but that is cause everyone can upload crap to steam workshop.thats a reason why i am glad there are no maps on workshop, it would mean many more absolutely effortless 3 hour build maps would flood the workshop and its even harder to find the good ones.the game works there is plenty of stuff for it, as i say the situation is not bad at all.now on the other side there is oovee and pavel, they more or less broke the game twice, it wasnt playable cause of crashes or other bugs they themself introduced with patches. this happened 2 times.they promis lots of stuff but they dont keep any of that.this is what makes us angry and we should have the brains to not let it spill over anywhere where the anger does not belong, in this case the game itself. its just a programm its innocent.still the game is pretty healthy, plenty of ppl have called out the game as ""dead"" or something, but far from it, last time i look it had 1800 ppl playing and that is a lot for this game and its age.there is a pretty dedicated following for the game, despite the problems with the publisher.in the end i say it has again to do with expectations, ppl expected content patches, ppl expected it to be early access while it never was, and oovee, the fools started promising stuff to keep the masses quiet. that was the biggest mistake in my eyes. cause nothing of it ever happened.(we got kirovets though)that is what got ppl rly angry in the first place.so to summ this up, its not the games fault, the game is fine and work right now so just play it if you enjoy it.projecting feelings for one thing onto another is a natural mechanic we humans fall for, but its wrong, if you hate the dev´s dont hate the game cause its two different things rly.we would all love a ETS2/spintires hybrid, where you start out with blue truck and have to deliver loads to earn money and buy new trucks and tires and better addons and trailers to deliver bigger loads and so on, and that on much larger maps than the 1024m x 1024m maps we get in spintires now. a game where we have the game play mechanic and build up systems from ETS2 and the driveing physics and offroad deformable terrain goodness from spintires.if someone bring out this game i talk about, they have my money for sure but till than i play spintires from time to time cause its a good expirience, i do enjoy it. not as excessive as i used to(i have 1500+ hours) but still from time to time.anyways, guys get your missguided anger under control and play the game for what it is, if you dont enjoy that i venture the guess the game is not for you. cause with all the maps and trucks now ST never was better. i play my first ~400 hours on the 5 stock maps + flood which they release late, cause there was nothing else, just the stock maps and trucks.all the new trucks and maps did add another 1000+ hour playtime for me so to speak. so i can not complain about a lack of content in my view ;)UPDATE: October 2015Oovee put out a new update to the game, and this time it is good for a change. Now one and a half year after release, things may start to look better.ORIGINAL Review ->Do i reccomend the game? yes, the game is sweet when it works.Do i reccomend giving money to the publisher oovee? no!its up to you, read around in the forums and you find out oovee is made up of amateurs. the game was basically fine at releasy summer 2014(as i bought it), month later, winter 2014 they started changeing stuff. in the last 4 month they broke the game twice so it was unplayable in multiplayer, a crash was guaranteed more or less. that was in december and march.to push out a ""hot"" fix takes like 3 to 4 weeks for oovee.so if you want to give money to them, i am not sure, i already have i cant help it. still i give thumbs up cause i reccomend  the game itself. its a nice programm and you can spend quiet some hours with it.

												First of all, I'm really glad my friend convinced me to get this game. It was well worth it and has something strangely addictive about it.Now lets talk about the details:- Graphics: The game looks stunning. The engine may have some flaws and its not 100% detailed but all in all it looks very convincing (which to me, is was matters most) and atmospheric.- Physics: Simply amazing. The mud-simulation is groudbreaking. Also very notable (and not mentioned as often) is the water simulation. Water currents are simulated. Water applies force to your vehicles in a very realistical way and you can even roughly estimate the depth of the water by looking at the way the ripples form on the surface.- Sound: Can't complain about it, the vehicles sound good. You even get to hear a knocking sound from your engine when the vehicle is heavily damaged. Environmental sounds are also pretty nice and create a convincing in-the-woods atmosphere.- Controls (driving): Takes a bit to get used to but overall they're pretty solid. The controls with a gamepad are also quite ok, however only the keyboard controls can be modified at the moment.- Camera: I agree with the others here that the camera movement feels very weird at first. Give it some time though and you'll get used to it. The system isn't so bad after all, though I assume that it was mainly built for use with a gamepad (with which it works pretty well).- Gameplay: I guess this comes down to personal preference. Spintires is quite challenging and you will only enjoy it if you like those challenges and if you enjoy fighting against the mud and overall harsh terrain. If you do however, you'll find that the game can be incredibly addictive.- Learning curve: Pretty steep to be honest. I agree that some sort of tutorial or a map that starts out with easy terrain would be needed. If you're not at least roughly familiar with driving in mud, you'd better learn it fast because that will be your first challenge.ps.: I suggest starting on the ""coast"" map, that one is rather forgiving.- Multiplayer: Working together with a friend makes things alot easier and can be quite entertaining when something goes wrong. I'm surprised how well suited this game is for coop !ps.: At time of wirting, steam isn't really the best place to buy this. Look around and you can get it significantly cheaper.			"

Is this game dead?This is the question everyone ask as it seems the developer and or publishers is having fun spending the coins we gave them when purchasing this game.Spintires is a great game and concept and in my previous review I recommended this game, but I can't do the same now as it isn't finished and probably never will be.The game is still after eight months since my purchase riled with game breaking bugs*.Where the issues with achievements not triggering being the most annoying for me.One of those achievements I spent dosens of hours trying to get but without luck, such a waste of time.There have been updates, but those turned out to be more detailed maps not ready for release when the game got rushed out on the market, but the core game is still not mended...If you are interested and find this on sale, go ahead and buy it but don't say I didn't warn you.*See list of problems in my previous review:Is this a road? Or is it a: River? Lake? Swamp? Ditch? Something else? In Spintires EVERYTHING can be a road! It would take too much time to write down everything I like with this game. From the mud torn up from the ground as you drive over it, or leaves falling off trees as you gently ""brush"" them with your truck! If you like driving around in the wilderness without fearing the government accusing you for damaging the environment, this is a must buy! There's also a strategic element in the game, which route to take and etc.However, there are some problems: Achievements trigger when they want or not at all! The camera implementation in this game must be one the worst I've seen.The trucks take damage but the damage doesn't affect how the truck behaves.(i.e. a 99% damaged truck* can still run) The large trucks are a bit too good, it is impossible to get them stuck in mud as the game doesn't care about them due to their weight would sink down and ""hang"" on the frame. Multiplayer is too easy, the objectives are the same as in SP which makes them a bit too easy to complete in MP. In multiplayer each player gets their own set of trucks, which makes the objectives even easier to complete. Attaching carts/trailers to trucks is very hard as the game is very precise with the position of the truck, the same applies to loading logs.IMHO randomly generated maps would help when you run out of things to do.  *Sure they're Russian made, but ...

												To start with:I have 249 hrs in this game Fun game with lots of potential. The core content lasted me about 10hrs the mods is what got me this far. However thats where the good ends.The bad: The devlopment of the game has constantly been one let down after another. The early patches came slowly (or so we thought we knew slow) and where bugged. New promises where made by said devloper and publisher and I refer to those two entities seppreatly because  they act as two sepperate things. Then came more delayed bugged patches which either released broken non working maps or broke game play entirely followed by severe conflict between Oovee the UK based Publisher and Pavle the Russian Devloper.  Then more promises made and and more let downs by both. The norm seems to be Pavel promises somthing then Oovee tells the forums about it then Pavel changes his mind posts his own stuff on an russian based media site and all the mud slinging repeats. The Worse: Publisher has moderators running damage controlle on whats supposed to be official forums while Pavel posts updates on his own social media website(btw us english speaking peeps have to realy on google translate to even read those posts by pavel as he only posts in russian). Oovee asks player base for more faith but wont answer questions and gets upset at posts that rightfully question why we should give them more faith and time. The most recent update is over a month behind the worst case scenario time frame that was offered up by Oovee for an update. Also as mods are what keeps this going so well that the devloper and publisher have also made it so you cant post up some mods/websites because they use modding tools that where leaked by the angered Dev at one point in a fight bewteen the two.Final Recommendation:Dont buy the game as it seems the only way these guys will listen is if the money stops flowing and they are forced under or to grow up and man up to the promises they keep making.

												Fantastic and very unique game. At first I was a bit sceptical since all you have to do is drive from point a to b through some mud, water, forest... but it didn't take long and I was totally hooked. It is hard to me to explain why this game is so fascinating for me, even though I am not particulary interested in trucks or offroading. And with the mod support and a lot of great user generated maps, there is a lot to do.Since some update I miss the possibility to find logs lying around in hidden places. Now there is a so called log kiosk, where you can spawn the logs that you want to load. That takes a little bit away from the challenge to have to maneuever and position your truck for every log, but other than this, I really love this game.			"

												I can't stop playing this game. Little else is more manly than gas-guzzling off-road trucks hauling around cargo and towing disabled vehicles. The physics in this game are quite accurate, from the way mud deforms under your weight to the way trees bend and snap as you trudge through them.While not neccessarily a racing game, it is all about careful maneuvering through tough terrain. The main goal of each map is to transport logs to the objectives; it's easier said than done! Both singleplayer and multiplayer modes are very fun and, I feel, relaxing. I often find myself playing Spintires late at night, probably because of the slow, lonely, and atmospheric nature of the game. "

												This game is truly amazing! The tech behind the game is amazing (deformable terrain!), run extremely well (custom, highly optimized game engine!) and it is very fun, especially when you have to get yourself out of a 'sicky' (excuse the pun) situation! I would recommend you use a gamepad as it is significantly easier to use than KB+M, but it is still totally playable with KB+M. There is a fairly large variety of vehicles to use from a small UAV (russian jeep) which is good for scouting, but gets stuck in the mud easily, to a massive MAZ (8 wheeled monster!). If you have £20.00 to spend and you have no idea what to buy, buy this as it will entertain you for a long time, and even longer with the excellent multiplayer!			"

												one of the finest off road games made to date, level of detail is awesome, the way the tyres deform according to terrain, the way the vehicles respond to the enviroment and the way the terrain responds back. All really really well done. Sadly as a result some things have suffered. Primarily the camera view! my god its shockingly bad, Its as if the guy who was in charge of the tyre animation was in charge. If you want a nice side profile of your truck then the camera will oblige, You get some lovely shots of the 8 wheeler smashing through the woods, Right up to the point it throws itself down a cliff upside down into a river. ask it for a forwards view and it fights you all the way, Twitching from one side to another, or getting too close to the truck when you search vainly for a better angle. SORT IT OUT! Next is the winch interface, This need refining as there are too many button presses and mouse clicks to perform smooth winching when required (oh and a few more yards of cable wouldnt hurt ya tight gits!) Last but not least is all the vehicles appear to be made of glass or paper mache as they damage far too easily. That said it is still a game I readily chucked 20 quid at, And if the mods available for the tech demo are anything to go by then it will shape up to be an awesome community created game when they get round to releasing mod support			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with this game. The challenge is high, especially in single-player mode. This game is not for light-sim players or casual players. It takes time, skill, and patience to succeed. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging sim. Multiplayer is only slightly easier, since you have others to help you out of any situation you find yourself in. The only problem I have seen so far is the lack of multiplayer searches. I can find one or two games, but none of them speaks English. That's fine, except that they will kick you from their server, and you're stuck doing single player. If there was a broader multiplayer search, or a way to set to a specific language, it would be spot on.Highly recommend game! Very enjoyable!			"

												This is rather great. I bought it because I understood it was a great re-creation of mud and off-road driving and was therefor something a little different. What it turns out to be though is all of the above, plus a rather excellent strategy and planning game where you're somethimes managing a number of vehicles with different abilities in an open world sandbox trying to achieve a common goal together. Heading out into the woods in the dead of night to rescue your plucky Land Rover from the grasp of nature is an excellent feeling. It's a pretty game too. Recommended!			"

												Very Good Game.  You deliver logs from areas of the map that are being clear cut to lumber yards using old era Russian heavy trucks in muddy terrain.  There is a bit of fog of war that can be cleared which allows you to get a view of the entire map.  Once you complete a level its back to square 1.  Does need more maps, more content.  It has MP and a WorkShop Community but not worth the $30.  Buy it on Sale if you want it or in a Humble Bundle.There maybe some support but noone knows if Oovee is working on it or not.			"

												I thought this game was a joke when I first saw it appear on Steam. Driving trucks through the mud for $30? Pfft! Get out of here.Then I tried the tech demo and was instantly hooked.This game has a lot to offer if you're looking to be entertained. There aren't really any objectives, but the maps are interesting to explore and the physics are hilariously fun. Who knew Russian logging could be so interesting?Pros:-Surprisingly good graphics-Deformable terrain and off-roading goodness-WINCHES-Varied and useful ""attachments"" that can be loaded onto your vehicle at a garage-There is a considerable challenge in just navigating the terrain, from towing a log trailer through deep muck to navigating river crossings that can easily flood your engine or tip you over-Multiplayer! -Heavy modding community presence-Terrain remains deformed between saving and loading your save back up. You can create trouble spots for yourself if you're not careful.-Refreshing gameplay, who else has made an offroad simulator even close to this?Mixed:- Camera is extremely robust, the developer knew players would need to see their vehicles from all kinds of wonky angles. This also makes the camera difficult to control/learn to use, however.- You can only control 1st and 2nd gears along with reverse. In order to reach gears 3+ you must shift into ""automatic"" meaning the subsequent shifts aren't under your control. This can be a problem, if say, you wanted to cruise along the road at the speed offered by 3rd gear but the transmission shifts itself to 4th and continues accelerating.- Wooded areas can be too dense. You may want to take a shortcut through some trees to avoid a muddy area you know you aren't able to surpass, but oftentimes you can't because the spacing between trees is too tight for your vehicle. This makes it VERY easy to trap yourself in a cluster of trees, especially on an incline.Bad:- Lack of objectives can be a turn-off for many players- Small selection of vehicles (though there are dozens available with mods) and they are strictly Russian.- Very narrow focus (Russian logging) which could easily have been expanded to other areas of the globe.- No independent saves. If you want to switch maps you must delete the save for the previous map you were on. It really makes no sense why the developer chose to do this.- There are some graphical glitches here and there, though nothing too serious- Random bugs. None that are game-breaking, but they can be annoying			"

I spent the first 30 mins in a truck rolled over on it's side trying to figure out how to use the physics properly to winch myself back up again..The environments are really well done and thought out, and how the land reacts to your vehicle really makes you think about how you're going to tackle the terrain. Visually there has been some tremendous effort put in to make sure the environments are immersive, even the smallest puddles react accordingly to the vehicles..The single player, I can forsee it getting repetitive after the inital charm of the game wears out.. All in all, this is something that's original and surprisingly well thought out for what is it..Don't forget your Diff Lock 8/10.. Wook.			"

												After having played the game a little longer I'm actually happy to change my review to a recommendation, but with a few important caviats:- The camera is awkward, and there's no sign of it changing. You'll get used to it, but will frequently battle against it.- If you're not into the whole 'driving a big thing in lots of mud' gimmick then turn back now, that's the game.- If you're looking for lots of 'game' then this title isn't for you, it's very sandboxy, but does contain some basic missions in scenarios.It feels like an early access game, but it's a good early access game.The good:- Environments are great. Just big enjough, remind me of wales a bit (especially the logging areas).- Vehicles are good, fair number of attacthments etc.- The game plays well. It feels good. Aside from the camera the experience is great. The UI could be better, but its servicable and not ugly.If it's on sale and you're intrigued, go for it!			"

												""Stuck in a Ditch Simulator 2014"" is the finest off-road driving game to date. The terrain melts like realistic butter under your 5 ft diamter tires as you struggle against that ♥♥♥♥♥, nature. You ford rivers and climb over mountains in your soviet era monster truck as you try to piece together the story. The Russian outback is a post apocalyptic mud factory covered in ""cloaking"" which you must overcome by actually getting places, which is much harder than it sounds. After setting up your own objects, cause ♥♥♥♥ you the game is not going to give you any, you trek into the woods in search of the Lumber Camp. After finally getting the the camp you will realize you are not equiped to do anything there at all. Thats right yopu naive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, You will need like 3 or 4 trucks there equiped with trailers, cranes, extra fuel tanks, and repair attachments, and that is just scratching the surface. Getting that stuff there is going to be really hard. You'll have to unlock trucks and attachemnts as you go and expolore more of the map. If there was some sort of Truck Dark Souls; This is it! Perhaps Lofty praise, but the game seems to just lay out some mechanics and let you go off into the world and try and exploit them as you tackle and unforgiving environment. Visually the game is absolutely stunning, not all the textures are really that sharp or impressive but all the ones that count are. The Deformation of the terrain is strangely hypnotic. Every instant looks like a Bob Ross painting except there is a badass truck ripping through the center of it!  If you think trucks are rad, or have any interest in off-roading, then this is the game for you. Good luck Comrade!			"

												After playing only a few hours of this game, I've found that I'm absolutely terrible at driving UAZs off-road. However, my spectacular failures were made hilariously fun by this game.As probably the most in-depth off-road simulation game I've ever played (and the only one at that) this game is incredibly good fun, even in the early stages. Now, whereas I'd love to see more challenges and other tasks I think that this game is definetely worth the buy.So take it from me. If you want to drive all manner of old Russian vehicles and potentially end up stuck in the mud, get this game and winch your backside out of it.			"

												A powerful message is inside: those trucks guzzle fuel, and pollute. Nature fights back with demonic mud, hidden rocks, trees between you and your goal! Jokes aside, this game is quite fun, but you should try the old demo before purchasing it, because everything is SO slow, that it might indeed not be for everybody. Also the camera is... ugh. Looks awesome, shows the truck and the road. The moment you need to see in front of you however, there is no way! It's always on the side, and it shows the road ahead nicely. Usually. Get between a few trees however, and you'll bump into a tree that was invisible. Drive at night down a small road with trees on the side, and you'll get to watch everything through the trees. Really, a camera on the hood would help a lot. You can wrestle that camera around, but it's easily the part that they need to improve of the whole game. That said controls are good, graphically it's not epic but looks good, and it has nice attention to detail like getting mud/water on the trucks in the correct places. Audio... engines sound nice, but nothing special. Also it like to lower the volume every time I start it, for some reason.Anyway, I really like this, and can only imagine how much more fun it would be with a friend.			"

												I should start off by saying that for all it's faults, I've found Spintires to be a very fun game. However it does have it's faults, for me the most annoying fault that exists in the current version of the game (one that has existed since the first Tech Demo) is the camera. It isn't the worst camera ever in a game, but with the camera forced off the the right hand side, avoiding objects on your left side can be a pain. Hopefully a camera option for the left side and a centered camera will be added at some point.Another fault of the game is it's damage system. Some of the vehicles get damaged far too quickly, for example the Kamaz (the orange one) takes damage just driving through mud or over dirt, and all vehicles take damage when a pine tree brushes their side mirrors. While taking damage in this way is very rarely crippling, it adds up over time and makes little sense when you're being penalized for what are at best cosmetic scratches.Finally the save system (or lack of one) the game only allows you to have one map saved at a time and if you switch maps it erases your save on the old one, hopefully this is resolved soon.Now for the positives. The game has a fantastic vehicle physics engine with each vehicle feeling very good to drive, the terrain system with it's mud and water simulation works very well and the game looks very good visually. The Winch/Towing System works well and allows you to get out of some sticky situations without reseting your vehicle. Multiplayer exists though I haven't played it so I don't know how it works.All in all I very much enjoy the game, though your mileage may vary. Might not be worth the asking price for you.My rating 7/10 (pretty good)			"

												Bought the game played with friends. First starting out friend flipped his truck two of us wenched onto his truck to flip him back up. Very realistic game and the environment makes the game challenging. But the only part I don't like is the lack of saving the game when playing multiplayer and the server drops after awhile. Also if you alt + tab out of the game it kicks you too and any trucks you were hauling resets when you join back.			"

												Great game, one of the best for physics and graphics, plus it runs really well, even on a low end computer! But, I do have some complaints, most important being the price. $30 is rather too much, I think it should be more like $20, like ETS2. Secondly, the way the camera automatically zooms in after driving for about ten seconds, then there's the fact that the steering wheel doesn't turn, and the way the driver is flailing his arms about does not relate to how you are steering. Also, you can only have one winch at a time, and when you swap vehicles, the previous one's parking brake turns on, which is annoying if you want to push it, for example. It would be cool if, in the future, there were things like rain, and maybe more animals running about.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator Russian style! This game is very good, it's slow but that allows you to move your camera angle around and really appreciate the way the trucks move, bounce and jarr, the way they sink in mud and splash through rivers. And the joy of taking something where it really shouldn't be. If you like ETS2 and you like offroad, then you will love this. The self satisfaction you get from removing yourself from a sticky situation is grand, and if your a hoarder of achievemnets then this game has many.

												Do you know what a locker is? Does the term 'UAZ' mean anything to you? Did you try recent 'off-road' 'sims' such as Off-Road Drive, then sigh and go back to Screamer 4x4? If you answered yes to the above then this game is for you!The terrain deformation that put this game on everyone's radar a few years back is still present, and the world doesn't just reset after you leave the area or even reload the game! Repeatedly take the same route through a soft paddock and you'll soon be fetching a support vehicle or left scratching your head whilst staring at an overturned log truck. It's challenging alright, even on the 'casual' setting, but it's also a lot of fun and very rewarding when you get things right.The visuals are incredible considering the relatively low specs required - with max settings I'm getting 60FPS @ 1920x1200 on a 3.6GHz i5, GTX460 and 4GB RAM. The lighting is stunning and it actually gets properly dark at night, which is all too rare in games.Like most games though it is far from perfect--The camera is great...until you try to move it. It feels like it was designed by Satan himself and is easily the worst part of the game-Controller support needs work. Can't configure buttons and you need to keep KB&M handy for important things like map navigation and using truck mechanisms (eg- winches). The use of analog triggers is also poorly implemented and trucks jump to about 50% throttle at the slightest press.-There is only autosaving and it only saves when you go to the main menu or quit. This means if the game crashes you can lose hours of progress, and you also can't have multiple simultaneous games going.-At time of writing, no mod supportIf you can see your way past the above then you could have a lot of fun with this game. Definitely worth the $30.			"

There are all types of cars and models. Some make nice noise while some look fancy. There are others that are good at cutting through the mud to ensure we get to the destination safely and unhurt. The lovely sound of birds chirping in the background gives the game a real touch. There are drivers in the car in the new update. Even the lights make a fascinating sound when you turn them on.

												Bought this game during a gameplay drought.  I stumbled upon it and thought, ""Hey, muddin' game.""  The game is visually satisfying.   Here's how the game works:  Get 'X' amount of logs to the objective. You have 5 maps to pick from (they recently just added one).  I have a choice of a Jeep or a rear wheeled drive pick up truck.  The jeep can carry a small amount of repair points known as a trunk, and the truck can carry logs a small amount of logs (not enough for one trip).  I take the jeep and start muddin' my way through the terrain.  The map is blocked by 'fog of war' and can be unlocked by driving up to fog unlocks, which will reveal portions of the map.  From here you can see other trucks spread thoughout the map that can be unlocked by driving up to them. Bigger trucks.  Bohemoths that can traverse the thickest of mud.  You find one and unlock it, but the engine wont start because it's too damaged.  This is where you would use the trunk from the jeep and apply it to the new rig, but it won't fix the whole thing, only patch it. So know I have to limp this thing back to start, which will always be a garage.  From here it will automatically fuel and repair your rigs.  Depending on the rig, you can change what you haul, from an empty fuel cistern that can be filled at a gas station on the map, to a garage trailer that can be placed on a garage point, or a long log trailer that takes the maximum amount of logs to the objective.   You see, the objective is easy, gathering the resources to complete the objective is where the gameplay is at.Recently the devs have started working on this game again, which is AWESOME!  This game has soooo much potential.  This is one of those games I like to come back to with my friends and mess around.  It kinda reminds me of Top Gear.			"

												This game is just great. When you think that all is well and you have it all down, boom your truck flips. Or maybe you've just gotten across a river only to find the ground after it is pure mud. This is Spintires. This is literal hell. But if it isn't a hell of a lot of fun.It simulates the diffculty of logging in Russian forests near impeccaby. It's game engine is also worth a mention, best mud physics I've ever seen on any game. Easy 8.5/10. Needs more depth (more objectives, trucks, maps etc).If you like sims or automotive games you'll have a blast with this one.			"

												When I first saw videos for Spintires back when it was Early Access I assumed this was similar to the Farming Simulator 2015 games that you just drive farm equipment around and do meaningless tasks.  Then when I read that the point of the game is to drive around and haul logs I thought ""this game can't be that fun...""It turns out after purchasing it I found myself stuck playing it for a few hours at a time.  Something about driving big, dirty, smoke-bellowing, diesel trucks through mud is entertaining.  The trucks look amazing, and there are some crash physics for when you rub against a tree or a large rock and watch the bumpers bend permanantly.  The mud and water physics aren't perfect, but they look absolutely amazing for a video game.  Sometimes it feels like you are watching a video of an actual truck.The lighting can be goofy and I find it's defintely easier to drive in the dark with the headlights off than with them on, which limits the view to only the cone in front of you.  But for as generic as the gameplay seems, it definately keeps you entertained for a while.My first time trying multiplayer mode was a complete blast.  Having to help tow your friends out of a mud bog was hilariously fun.  I have many screen shots of flipped over trucks with my friends' names hoving above them.The game is still a work in progress, but I have thouroughly enjoyed my purchase of this game.			"

												Though I haven't played the spintire thing, I can report that this game is spintirely unique, spintirely challenging, and large enough that you could probably spend your spintire life exploring it. I'm not spintirely sold on the freeform-sandbox concept, though: there aren't spintirely enough things to do. Still, if what you want is a Soviet-offroad-tractor-mud-pit-simulator, this game has the spintire market to itself.Spintires.			"

												Great Offroad simulator, I have played every offroad game that has come out in the last ten years, and spin tires is one of the best. As far as a mud driving simulator it is in a class of its own, the overall feel of the vehicles in the mud is really spot on, the way that the suspension reacts and the trucks wieght shifts around is very impressive. I wish the game handled high speeds better, I understand that the whole point of the game is to carefully navitgate the dangerous terain but every truck becomes very unstable at higher speeds (which is still pretty slow). If the engine could handle speed better it would really open up a lot of options for the modding community. That said i would still highly recomend this game to any offroad enthusiest, for me it is a very relaxing game, just strolling my 100 ton 8 wheel drive truck through the country side, listening to the birds and the churning mud under my tires, It's almost zen-like.

First, explore the whole map, then unlock garages to make things easier, then drive logs across map, fail, try again, fail try again:)  And there are enough different maps to spend tens and tens of hours with your russian trucks.And if it's still not enough, you can do all this with your friends in multiplayer!

												There are many reviews already describing every single detail of this game, so I won't repeat it. I will put it simply - if you ever, just a little, felt tempted to buy this, because you though it might be fun, go for it! Graphics is great, physics is the best ever seen in this type of game, and the gameplay is fun, even though it does not seem so. Sure after several hours of gameplay it migh feel a little repetitive, and it is, but this should change with the mod support. Once this will come, possibilities are endless.			"

												Seeing as this game is wonderful, the developers of this game are taking their time to ensure the updates are high quality. They are currently working on another map for SpinTires (Go check their Forums to find out more)-PROS-1. Game Mechanics - Winches work wonderfully, Mud deformation (could use a tad bit more work)2. Graphics - In my honest opinion, the graphics look astonishing.3. Trucks - Different types. Standard (6x6, and 8x8s)-CONS-1. Multiplayer - As soon as someone joins a game, they either get disconnected, lose connection to Steam, or just leave for no reason. (This is why Multiplayer Saves should be a thing.) *Oovee and IMGN are currently working on this. There looks to be no syncing for mud deformation, no truck sounds for other players (to make it easier, The host can't hear other players engines, but the other player - Bob, for now - can't hear anyone else's engine noises, only his)2. Camera - The camera, for me, is great for taking pictures, but can be a bit of a nuisance for actually playing the game. There should be this camera, and another, like a standard driving game camera where the camera is aimed at the back, and it will rotate around the truck. (Like the Forza Motorsport games)3. As of yet, it's not being update alot (But hey, it's still relatively new... Kinda...) - They are planning to make bigger and better updates to improve the game, but this will take time.For people who just buy the game on a whim and say ""I hope it's as good as it looks."" Please, download the demo first and try it out for yourself.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this game if you like off-roading in big trucks, and actually accomplishing something while doing so.*One other thing, is that there are mods for this game, but they will replace certain trucks, and disable achievements. If you ever install a mod, make sure to back up your game files before doing so. :)			"

												This is like the best off road simulator ever. Myself being a starting off road enthusiast this game brings heavy off road fun without need to get dirty and risking breaking your car. Sure the main star in this game is a deformable terrain, it looks and feels almost like the real dirt, mud and water. It sure feels sort of arcade, but from all the games i played it still is the most realistic one.It really shows how much pain it is to deliver logs from the place where they been cut down. I hope to see many other new objectives soon, like rescue missions, pathfinder missions and so on.In present state the game looks more like a tech demo than a completed product though. The terrain looks copy and paste sometimes, gameplay only locked on delivering logs and truck upgrading system sure needs to be more complex. Also bigger and more complicated maps.Also it might be a good idea to bring the financial element into game. So to have cost of repair in mind each tome you decide to go daredevil.So... I bought the game immediately after i saw it on steam and i have no regrets about it! Looking forward for the game to become best offroad simulator ever for many years to come.			"

												Great game.  Can be very challenging and frustrating especially on Hardcore mode.  The physics in the game are well above par and the destructable terrain looks amazing.  If you have any spare cash laying around and enjoying playing in the mud then think about picking this game up especially if it happens to be on sale.  There are a few drawbacks that the devs have said they are working on:camera - hard to control and get where you want to lookmore maps - if you are unable to play online this game can get dry quick unless you can get some modsthings that I think need to be worked:chat - when you first open the chat bar online sometimes it will close for no reasonin game voice chat needs to be addedmore than one winch use at a timethese are just little things that I would like to see done and they don't out way the reason not to get the game.  I love and record videos of the game that you can watch on my profile.Get the game.  Offroad is fun when the terrain is destructible.			"

												So,I just want to state that the first thing I did was to play multiplayer, and it was within the first 10 minutes of playing the game, that I learnt just how far a soft suspension truck is supposed to tilt.I roll to the bottom of a hill, on my roof, helpless with a stalled engine, and no idea how to get out of the situation I had just created.  Laughing at the same time at how I could go and ♥♥♥♥ up so fast.Anyway, I do what anyone would do, I hit every key looking for the chat button, ""Ah, it's Y"", I think to myself.  I then proceeded to plead to my comrades to save me!In the effort to save me, my friend Crevarski gets pulled over the edge of the hill and ends up stuck at the bottom of it, ensnared by all the surrounding stones deeper in the pit.This was, as you might assume, was unbelievably hilarious.We then both proceed to beg for the random player to save us.In his attempts to save us, he is then also pulled off the cliff, just to roll onto his roof on top of me.This led to tears of laughter on my end.Within the first 10 minutes, I knew my money was well invested, just because I've never laughed so much at having a lack of understanding the game.  The game is just hilarious as you go from blunder to blunder, stalling engines in every possible way possible for the first few hours.Once you're past that part of the game, and you start getting good at traversing the environment in your behemoths, it occurs to you that 1 truck is not going to cut it when tackling this unforgiving terrain!  Leading you to try and get a team sorted, where you'll have to assign everyone a task.  Such as 2 log haulers, and the other 2 as the support, dealing in the winching, repairing and refueling!(For those of you that don't enjoy multiplayer, you can switch to any truck unlocked at any time to go and save the one you just drowned in 'quick-mud')Anyway, this game is so unbelievably addictive, not just for the strangely addictive gameplay, but for the amount of teamwork that is required for a driving simulator, that even the 'crème de la crème' of driving games manage to skim the surface of.Plus, with the game being relatively new, I will ignore its minor flaws, such as the camera being annoying at times, and a few missing options that would of been nice, but aren't exactly going to ruin your time, as I'm sure most of these annoyances will be addressed very soon!I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone that is interested in off-roading 'AND' games like Euro Truck Simulator.8.5/10			"

												I mainly bought this game because I saw what a great mods there have been released for the demo only. The game itself is somewhat monotonous because there isn't a lot to do besides drive around. Some options such as reset vehicles (if everything is stuck) and different savegames are missing. But other than that it's awesome drive around in those large trucks and cars, banging around in the mud, getting stuck and somehow be able to drive and winch yourself out of it. I must say this is a game is of a genre you have to like, it's not a game for everyone. I greatly recommend buying it though, if this kind of driving appeals to you!			"

												Took the plunge and was not disappointed! This is pretty much the best true off-road simulator you'll find but bear in mind its NOT A RACING GAME. Speed is not the name of the game here but rather realistic navigation of a deep Russian forest! You've got mud, pools/streams/rivers/oceans of water, steep inclines, dried out riverbeds, dense forests, sharp switchbacks up a mountain side... a good variety of terrain.The game is incredibly simple in its objectives but its just plain fun to set out on a new map and find the best routes to load up and then deliver loads of lumber. Yes, thats the current way to ""beat"" the maps - you need to load lumber either with a crane or by going to specific lumber yards and loading up on short, medium or long logs and then hauling them across the map to drop points. AND THE PHYSICS! Damn, best mud and water physics I've seen for a driving game. Your tires will dig massive ruts, water has realistic currents and will flow even between your tires... its amazing. Where there was once a pristine trail could become a muddy hell at the end of the map after you've hauled heavy loads through it. As for the vehicles you've got an assortment of Russian trucks such as an old dually, a recon jeep and then you can even get up to massive 8x8 rolling fortresses that can only be stopped by the worst mud pits imaginable. Speaking of that recon jeep, each map starts out cloaked in black swirls/clouds that prevent you from seeing all the map right away. The cloaks can be removed simply by moving near them but they are often hidden away in deep forest/rough terrain and its pretty fun to scout out the unkown with your trusty jeep and reveal the map!The devs totally plan on supporting the game into the future and will be surely adding new trucks, maps and even new objectives/features so this already simple but fun game will become even greater with time!

												Over 1 year later, 9/10. > Workshop support added> Game is a bit smoother> Different maps than beforeOnly downside is the developer-publisher relationship that has resulted in many effed up situations. Hopefully this is resolved in the future.--Fun game. TONS to say about the good. I'd rate it a 8/10 for the Legacy build. 6/10 for the current update.ALL data gets written over with updates. Backup before you update... or change from legacy to current build...> Mod support is amazing, beware of the custom maps since not all work properly.> Lots of fun aspects to mess with in the .XML files but unfortunatly you can't earn achievements unless you switch back and forth with backups of the media.zip folder (I do this). > Easy to get achievments if you look at guides and are willing to attempt.> Controller support is amazing. Fun to play with both a controller, and a wheel. Button mapping is simple and easy to access.			"

												SPINTIRES is a very respectable offroad truck simulator.  Much like actually driving heavy equipment, whenever you get in a hurry, things will go wrong.  On hardcore mode, you have to physically recover your downed vehicles with judicious use of winches and cabling, and a realistic fuel cycle.I do wish there were a little more elaborate cabling options for pulling yourself out of tight spots, but that is an extremely minor complaint in the face of otherwise excellent gameplay. The physics are impressively real for the most part, with very few and rare glitches to break your suspension of disbelief.  If you have the patience and want to drive through beautiful rural areas less seen, I highly recommend this game.			"

												*This Post Is For Developers*UPDATED JAN 11, 2015ALL IN ALL EXCELLENT GAME BUT, Some More Ideas For Next Update!-**PLEASE ADD SLI AND CROSSFIRE COMPATABILITY**-Should be able to choose the total objective points for each log yard.-Shifting should be able to be done with keyboard keys, as well as the mouse.-More levels. A rocky level, A level where you have to make the roads yourself with the proper equipment.-Once objective is complete the level should not be complete. Logs could then be sold which can be used to buy lift kits and tire upgrades winch upgrades snorkle upgrades horsepower upgrades ect. -Do all the vehicles have to have P.T.O. winches which do not work when vehicle is tipped on its side and not running? Maybe some of the smaller vehicles could be electric which will still work when engine is off. At lest the jeep should have this type of winch.-More vehicles, Vehicles to make your own roads, high horsepower vehicle to play around in the mud with.			"

												If you're interested solely in the idea of driving offroad through fairly realistic mud/water/rocks then this game does that very well.  It's not realistic to the point of being punishing but it does a good job of staying very far away from being arcade and it's satisfying to watch the simulated mud moving around as you drive through it.As for the rest of the game...it's more of a tech demo...you can load logs onto a truck from 1 or 2 log locations on the map and deliver them elsewhere to complete an achievement...you can take a trailer load of 'garage' parts to 1 or 2 spare garage locations on a map to unlock them(this is where you repair and get fuel trailers/change tires/change equipment on the trucks such as the crane attachment)....and you can offroad to ""cloaking"" places that obscure your map view in the beginning.  Outside of those few tasks the rest of the content has to come from you....maybe you got stuck and switch to another truck to come winch yourself out....maybe you broke a truck or need fuel so you grab yet another truck to bring repair points/fuel to yourself.....or maybe you drove through the same spot a few times and now the ruts have made you stuck.  Things can be a bit more fun if you have a friend or two(not random people) to play multiplayer with so you can convoy around together.  Over all the maps seem to be a bit small at roughly 3kmx3km(can take a while crawling in mud) and the lack of any additional missions or non-player AI means the game really does feel like a tech demo and given the terrible relations the devs have with the community I bet it'll stay like a tech demo.........BUT that doesn't stop me from recommending it to anybody that wants to do some offroading from the comfort of their home.

												I absolutely love this game but it's not for everyone. Its essentially a simulator, but the physics are actually great unlike most simulators. The goal is essentially to pick up and deliver loads of lumber. But theres map to reveal, garages to unlock by delivering supplies, and repair and gas trailers to service your trucks (which you will need to do). Theres lots of (functional) customization to do and each truck has its own options. Including having a fully controllable crane!The game mechanics include deforming mud. So as roads are driven on the roads will degrade visibly as you leave your ruts in your wake. Trucks have lockable differentials and all wheel drive for when you need to get through the really tough terrain, which is most of the time. Trucks that are carrying loads feel considerably heavier than empty trucks. The physics are just awesome. My gf laughs at me but I swear, I've been driving down a rough road at about 3mph, and I've been literally on the edge of my seat because I'm afraid I'm going to tip the truck and lose my load after a long trek.If you enjoy Ice Road Truckers or watching Bonecrusher drive the muddy Maine logging roads in American Loggers, or you just love trucks like me then you're going to enjoy this game.My one complaint, and I am not alone in this, is the camera. It is pretty unweildy but I got mostly used to it. But there are times that you just can't get the view you need. The developers claim they are going to fix this in an update but that hasn't happened yet at the time I'm writing this.Other than that, the game delivers exactly what they say and they do it well. Highly recommended.			"

												    SpinTires is a little different then most games.  It's a more... relaxing game.  There's no time limits, items to collect or dangers to avoid.  Each map does have a mission and you do have to unlock areas on the overhead map and there are hidden vehicles to unlock.  But, if you want to do the mission you can do that or you could just drive around.  They have done some good updates and added 2 new maps.      Which brings me to one of my major issues.  It seems that evey time they do an update, the save games are deleted.			"

												I must admit I am having some troubles getting into this game. When I first saw the title I was really impressed with the graphics and the detail of the environments. The East European game companies seem to take a lot of pride in their depictions of the back country. I am just having a F#*^k of a time getting rolling, getting some good runs in, some ""yee haw"" please? I will keep at it, despite a tooth grinding dislike of the control structure, and how quickly I get mired. I realize a character and some storyline is excesss baggage at this stage, and I do enjoy just pushing throught to see whats on the other side of the mountain, but maybe it would be a bit more involving  to walk out of a garage with some Georgian (your call which one) country tunes accompanying my climb into a cab where I ground my oversized mug of coffee in an oversized coffee cup holder and check my brake cylinders, set my radio, and look at a map where dispatch has marked log haul jobs, questionable terrain, and some mineral sites to assay(or something like that, maybe set seismic lines, tag trees, bust out a shindaiwa brush saw and whack some weeds). A secondary gameplay mode with a 3rd person character doing some simple tasks to break up the vehicular action, short, not terribly challenging, the game should still be about getting you there.The decision not to was probably made long ago, but the game is still young and a DLC add on to flesh out the game with a character might tip the review scales a bit, dont need to go too deep, he/she doesnt need  a motive beyond a days work, just some appropriate lines, ""I dont think the gas is going to hold out"" or ""Deeper than I thought"", as you get out, walk over to a tree, and set your winch cable, maybe throw a wizz. Some will consider this a waste of time, role play is in the mind, and if you play this a lot, you probably have a character lurking in your minds subconcious purgatory...... I am Yvgeni, who smokes lousy french cigarillos, and listens to Ukranian death metal in his truck, and gets annoyed at the bugs. So how about a $3.99 overhaul DLC, Slick up the interface, especially for gamepad, add some different terrain, different scenery, scare up an elk or two, involve me as a character with a simple setting and step up the nasty mudbogs after I get some momentum going. I will play when the mood strikes regardles, it is a good game, but I think the team moved on before they took full advantage of the sandbok they built.			"

												First off i'd like to comment about the the people who generaly complain about the game, people always buy things expecting it to be the perfectly polished with not a single bug, not even the big game devs of triple A titles can get away with no bugs and they have huge teams. so to oovee i say congrats on how far you came i don't care how long it takes for things to get better but i don't mind waiting Now the game :The game itself is entertaining and fun, some of the maps are a real challenge and can be hard to finish.PROS :good graphics great physics (minor bug here and there)challenging gameplayDecent sized community (though alot just complain about how nothing is perfect)CONS:updates are abit slow some updates render the game unplayable at times but oovee gets round to fixing them rather than abandoning the game all in all if you want the game get it but if you're the type who can't stand even a slight bug stay away and learn some patience			"

												Bought the game played with friends. First starting out friend flipped his truck two of us wenched onto his truck to flip him back up. Very realistic game and the environment makes the game challenging. But the only part I don't like is the lack of saving the game when playing multiplayer and the server drops after awhile. Also if you alt + tab out of the game it kicks you too and any trucks you were hauling resets when you join back.			"

												Great game, one of the best for physics and graphics, plus it runs really well, even on a low end computer! But, I do have some complaints, most important being the price. $30 is rather too much, I think it should be more like $20, like ETS2. Secondly, the way the camera automatically zooms in after driving for about ten seconds, then there's the fact that the steering wheel doesn't turn, and the way the driver is flailing his arms about does not relate to how you are steering. Also, you can only have one winch at a time, and when you swap vehicles, the previous one's parking brake turns on, which is annoying if you want to push it, for example. It would be cool if, in the future, there were things like rain, and maybe more animals running about.			"

												Now this is a simulator. Paired with a gaming wheel it is a match made in heaven. Even with out a wheel its a fun, and addicting, slow paced game. The relism is on par with its potential. Only one thing though, when on the manual shifting setting with a proper shifter, there should be a notification about the clutch burning up, causing damage. Other than that, a great representation and leader of simulation games.			"

												This is rather great. I bought it because I understood it was a great re-creation of mud and off-road driving and was therefor something a little different. What it turns out to be though is all of the above, plus a rather excellent strategy and planning game where you're somethimes managing a number of vehicles with different abilities in an open world sandbox trying to achieve a common goal together. Heading out into the woods in the dead of night to rescue your plucky Land Rover from the grasp of nature is an excellent feeling. It's a pretty game too. Recommended!			"

												I can't stop playing this game. Little else is more manly than gas-guzzling off-road trucks hauling around cargo and towing disabled vehicles. The physics in this game are quite accurate, from the way mud deforms under your weight to the way trees bend and snap as you trudge through them.While not neccessarily a racing game, it is all about careful maneuvering through tough terrain. The main goal of each map is to transport logs to the objectives; it's easier said than done! Both singleplayer and multiplayer modes are very fun and, I feel, relaxing. I often find myself playing Spintires late at night, probably because of the slow, lonely, and atmospheric nature of the game. "

However, getting a truck stuck in the mud for an hour will truly test your mental stability. I definitely recommend trying this game, but make sure you bring some friends.			"

Not how this does anyway.. I know it looks just like logging but there's lots of modders that have been playing with this for years so you can put whatever vehicle you want into it.. If it's off roading your looking for it's this. Nothing else.**Edit 27/10/15** Since the update that has apparently fixed many, many bugs (None that have ever affected my own, or my friends gameplay experience), Ovee have decided that the unofficial mods aren't representative of the game so you can no longer use them, you can only use the official mods from the steam workshop.... That doesn't appear to exist yet... Thanks Ovee... This update totally sucks. I can't even understand how it could possibly affect Ovee?

												Bought this game during a gameplay drought.  I stumbled upon it and thought, ""Hey, muddin' game.""  The game is visually satisfying.   Here's how the game works:  Get 'X' amount of logs to the objective. You have 5 maps to pick from (they recently just added one).  I have a choice of a Jeep or a rear wheeled drive pick up truck.  The jeep can carry a small amount of repair points known as a trunk, and the truck can carry logs a small amount of logs (not enough for one trip).  I take the jeep and start muddin' my way through the terrain.  The map is blocked by 'fog of war' and can be unlocked by driving up to fog unlocks, which will reveal portions of the map.  From here you can see other trucks spread thoughout the map that can be unlocked by driving up to them. Bigger trucks.  Bohemoths that can traverse the thickest of mud.  You find one and unlock it, but the engine wont start because it's too damaged.  This is where you would use the trunk from the jeep and apply it to the new rig, but it won't fix the whole thing, only patch it. So know I have to limp this thing back to start, which will always be a garage.  From here it will automatically fuel and repair your rigs.  Depending on the rig, you can change what you haul, from an empty fuel cistern that can be filled at a gas station on the map, to a garage trailer that can be placed on a garage point, or a long log trailer that takes the maximum amount of logs to the objective.   You see, the objective is easy, gathering the resources to complete the objective is where the gameplay is at.Recently the devs have started working on this game again, which is AWESOME!  This game has soooo much potential.  This is one of those games I like to come back to with my friends and mess around.  It kinda reminds me of Top Gear.			"

												Very fun, I would recommend to anyone who wants to have some fun alone or with friends in a VERY fun simulator.  This game is very slow paced and you will find yourself stuck in mud trying to get out more than you will actually find yourself driving.  But thats all the fun of the game, after youve beet working for 20+ minutes with your friends trying to escape a certain mudhole, the feeling is amazing.  Maps are fun, though I would like to see more diversity in some of the future DLC's they Devs are planning on, all the maps as of now are all muggy and wet in a forest area.  I would like to see something like the desert dunes or snowy alaska, maube even some rack crawling jeeps added into the game for some different type of gameplay, rather than just slow moving jeeps/ 8 wheelers.  You can easily fix that though by downloading a few mods which add some very nice vehicles to the game, be warned, after a mod is downloaded you will not be able to play multiplayer so back up your game files before downloading them.  8/10 strongly recommend, escpecially for fun times with your friends!

												Probably one of my favorite simulators.  The realism is amazing and challenging.  I was surprised that such a well designed game was possible from a small game file compared to most games these days requiring between 10-30GB of data to download.  Many of the players have complained about the availability of vehicles/equipment, but that's because they don't understand that you have to unlock those features as part of making the game fun and challenging at the same time.  I myself fell into that trap of wondering if the game was worth buying and waited for the game to go on sale incase I didn't like it, but the game has totally become worth it after only playing for a few hours.

												The physics and effects are pretty incredible.  It's neat as a toy, but don't expect anything more than a few big sandboxes where you can drive a couple trucks through mud. Developer hasn't been particularly responsive to the community, which is always worrying. Still giving it a recommend because there's pretty much nothing else out there like this, but I'd wait for a sale.			"

												This game is amazing, its basically a 'getting bogged in mud' simulator, single player is ok, but multiplayer is alot more fun due to the fact if you get stuck you get your mate in something more powerful to winch to the front of you and just pull you out, same goes for when you tip over.The only drawback is there is no saving the world in multiplayer which can be very frustrating because your usually spending 1.5-3hrs on the 1 map to complete the objective if you havent done it before.I cant wait til more content becomes available for this game :)			"

												Euro Truck Simulator Russian style! This game is very good, it's slow but that allows you to move your camera angle around and really appreciate the way the trucks move, bounce and jarr, the way they sink in mud and splash through rivers. And the joy of taking something where it really shouldn't be. If you like ETS2 and you like offroad, then you will love this. The self satisfaction you get from removing yourself from a sticky situation is grand, and if your a hoarder of achievemnets then this game has many. It's a special game that looks beautiful and does just what you'd expect it to do.			"

												Love the game, It is for sure a challenge to some others more a expierment play ground for vehicle modding. all in all its a great game, do whish there were some other means to winch your truck out, other than just the standard winch that only works if you truck remains running. but all in all it's great, i do hope to see like more maps and trucks added in the future, this could become a fun multiplay game that truly. harness's the reality of off road transport and driving. the physx's of the ground and vehicle articualtion is simply wonderful. would love to see some weather challenges in futire or currrent maps like winter maps or fall and spring. would love to be able to hop out of the trucks and walk around to like see where the truck could like fit between tree's an such. or just a simple fix add more switchable camera view's, would love to see some more types of heavy and light vehicles come to light in this game, specially for exploration and such, do wish the A-Series jeep's would allow more tires options, all in all its a solid game that i hope to drown many more hours into. love the idea snd premis behind it, truly a game i have been waiting to see hit the store. hope there is more to come.

												This review is based on the game as it came at the time I bought it (a few days ago) including all updates and patches that it would've had at that time.If you like the concept of this game and enjoy simulators then I doubt this game will disappoint. The graphics are gorgeous. The way the vehicles cut through the mud, brush past trees and slosh through water is all done superbly. I have never known another game that comes even close to simulating ground deformation in this way. The more you drive the tracks in big trucks, the more tricky sections can become churned up, giving you increasing challenges to get through. The level of detail on the vehicles is brilliant - swinging ropes, moving running gear, smoke and heat effects - it's all there. Although one thing that isn't there is any drivers. It seems a shame that in such an immersive simulator as this, the trucks appear to be just driving around magically by themselves. In terms of game-play, having a certain number of 'drivers' to use per map might have been a nice touch, but it's still a fantastic game even with innumerable invisible drivers.There's no music and it doesn't need any. The sounds of the vehicles are spot on. The roar of the really big diesel engines is throaty and satisfying, the transmission whines on the little Uaz truck and the thudding and clunking as you crawl over rough terrain is just right. The ambient sounds are also great. It's a bit like a sounds of nature relaxation CD (until you fire-up a truck of course).The maps are all very similar in visual appearance and there are no weather effects, just day & night, but each contains unique challenges.Within minutes of playing the game I hated the two camera views. The fixed 3rd person view seems useless, most of the time all you can see in this view is the back of the truck. The mouse-controlled view is the one to use, but it seems to be anchored to the truck in a strange place so it rotates awkwardly, it doesn't zoom out far enough, and when you do zoom out it automatically zooms back in again after a few seconds. Within hours of playing the game, I'd got used to the awkward camera angle and reconciled that when you're off-roading, you don't get to see all around the vehicle, or which way the steering wheels are turning etc. After continued playing the camera angle bothers me far less, but it would still be nice to zoom out more.If you like driving big trucks off road and have perhaps longed for a game that effectively simulates mud when off-road driving (which I have), then this is possibly the greatest game ever made. There is plenty to do so long as you enjoy the concept - scouting the terrain to uncloak the map, locating, repairing and refuelling additional trucks, keeping all your trucks fuelled and repaired, towing and winch recovery, setting up new garages and collecting and delivering loads of timber. The two main styles of play I have found so far have been scouting in the small truck, which gives a 'trials' type off-roading experience, picking the best route across terrain with no tracks, finding gaps to wind through trees, pushing through scrub and wading through uncharted depths. Then there's the more 'convoy' style of driving. Perhaps taking a couple of log trucks and a fuel tanker along wide (or at least, the widest you can manage to find) forestry tracks, using the vehicles together to find the best routes and recover, winch and tow each other when needed (and trying not to get all 3 of them stuck).However, if you just go out and drive in a truck to try and get from A to B, then auto-restore your vehicle back to the starting point if you crash and try over, you'll probably get bored quickly. I think you need to actually enjoy trying to recover stuck vehicles to appreciate this game, it's as much about vehicle recovery and problem solving as it is about driving.Moving long trailer loads is a nightmare, and that's exactly how it should be. It's incredibly challenging and rewarding to take big curtain sided trailers or long loads of logs from A to B without spilling the load, inching forward and back at corners to get the right angle, winching up muddy inclines and nervously crawling through water crossings.I don't even want to mention mods because this game is amazing without them, but I've gone and mentioned them now. Mods would be nice. It'd be nice to be able to add vehicles without them replacing existing vehicles in the game, and to get some new maps with a different look to them. But really, if you want to drive big trucks in mud, then this game allows you to just that, and it does so brilliantly.			"

												This game has come a long way since the early tech demos. I must say i'm more than impressed with the progress, this game has HUGE potential, even though there's only one objective; which is to deliver logs to the marked area(s), i hope there will be different objectives in the future. Only thing that bugs me; no american vehicles :'(. Yes yes, i know the description clearly states ""Soviet vehicles"" but it would still be nice to have a bit of diversity ;) Keep it coming oovee!

												This is like the best off road simulator ever. Myself being a starting off road enthusiast this game brings heavy off road fun without need to get dirty and risking breaking your car. Sure the main star in this game is a deformable terrain, it looks and feels almost like the real dirt, mud and water. It sure feels sort of arcade, but from all the games i played it still is the most realistic one.It really shows how much pain it is to deliver logs from the place where they been cut down. I hope to see many other new objectives soon, like rescue missions, pathfinder missions and so on.In present state the game looks more like a tech demo than a completed product though. The terrain looks copy and paste sometimes, gameplay only locked on delivering logs and truck upgrading system sure needs to be more complex. Also bigger and more complicated maps.Also it might be a good idea to bring the financial element into game. So to have cost of repair in mind each tome you decide to go daredevil.So... I bought the game immediately after i saw it on steam and i have no regrets about it! Looking forward for the game to become best offroad simulator ever for many years to come.			"

												This is by far the best driving game that involves off road and mud.  I've had it in my library for about a year now and the latest update has made it more fun by buffing the lower level vehicles.  Stomp around in the mud and get stuck.  Then unstick by yourself with wiches/pulling with other vehicles or do it multiplayer.  Only down side is it doesn't seem finished/lacks more goals/objectives.  On the upside is the realism of vehicles/off roading and imersion.			"

												This game is a fun abut challenging off-road game. You have to deliever logs to the objective while not getting stuck. There is terrain that will give out under weight and lots and lots of mud. The game has many trucks. It has huge russian trucks 10/10.			"

												one of the finest off road games made to date, level of detail is awesome, the way the tyres deform according to terrain, the way the vehicles respond to the enviroment and the way the terrain responds back. All really really well done. Sadly as a result some things have suffered. Primarily the camera view! my god its shockingly bad, Its as if the guy who was in charge of the tyre animation was in charge. If you want a nice side profile of your truck then the camera will oblige, You get some lovely shots of the 8 wheeler smashing through the woods, Right up to the point it throws itself down a cliff upside down into a river. ask it for a forwards view and it fights you all the way, Twitching from one side to another, or getting too close to the truck when you search vainly for a better angle. SORT IT OUT! Next is the winch interface, This need refining as there are too many button presses and mouse clicks to perform smooth winching when required (oh and a few more yards of cable wouldnt hurt ya tight gits!) Last but not least is all the vehicles appear to be made of glass or paper mache as they damage far too easily. That said it is still a game I readily chucked 20 quid at, And if the mods available for the tech demo are anything to go by then it will shape up to be an awesome community created game when they get round to releasing mod support			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with this game. The challenge is high, especially in single-player mode. This game is not for light-sim players or casual players. It takes time, skill, and patience to succeed. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging sim. Multiplayer is only slightly easier, since you have others to help you out of any situation you find yourself in. The only problem I have seen so far is the lack of multiplayer searches. I can find one or two games, but none of them speaks English. That's fine, except that they will kick you from their server, and you're stuck doing single player. If there was a broader multiplayer search, or a way to set to a specific language, it would be spot on.Highly recommend game! Very enjoyable!			"

												This game is great. Especially with a steering wheel.Here is what makes it great:* A unique setting.* Graphics at times achieve photorealism.* Well optimized.* Believable physics.* Realistic truck and tractor models.* My G27 works with it better than any other driving game I've tried,with little to no setting up.Weak points:* I don't like the floating UI.* Some minor glitches.* Hard to get into without watching some tutorials first.(You better do it if you want to successfully load up you truck with logs)Highly recommended for anyone wanting to experience brutal offroad driving.

												Getting stuck in mud, trying to transport logs through mud-infested roads are strangely addictive. Great physics, graphics and control makes it worse. If we can get better camera control, this will be the worst addictive game :P			"

												This game teaches you the valuable lesson that world is made of mud, not dirt.If you're one of those types who enjoys being in a sandbox game and making really challenging things to try and solve and get out of, Spintires is very much like that.  A major spontaneous problem solving game.  You may think the main objective of hauling lumber is very simple.  Well, it is, in concept.  The thing is, when your log truck rolls, then your winch truck runs out of gas, then your gas truck breaks down, you'll understand how it's so much deeper than just 'hauling lumber'.  It's like a mini-version of life in general...  You have your main goals, but yet on your way you're faced with many obstacles, some of which are created by the things you yourself have done.  That same sense of accomplishment is in this game, not only when you -finally- deliver the lumber, but every time you right a tipped truck, pack some wood using the crane, or unlock a new garage by delivering the garage trailer to a location.Not only is the concept simple but satisfying, the physics are top notch.  The mud physics are the main brunt of frustration in this game, as they are quite punishing and sometimes random as mother nature can be.  Aside from the couple glitches I've encountered [which both involved my truck being tossed into the air and spinning at an extreme velocity for no reason whatsoever], it plays like you'd expect a big lug of a truck to drive.  The one vehicle that is very strange to drive [as well as quite useless, in my opinion] is the regular 4x4 jeep.  It doesn't drive down the road, it bounces down the road, and will then sink when it hits mud faster than any of the other larger vehicles.Other than these few peeves, I fully enjoy playing this game for large portions of time.  It's very ambient.  No music, unless you include the insane and random guitar bit that will blow your eardrums out of your head every time you get an achievement.  Sometimes, I'll put on my own tunes on the computer and play.  It's as if you have the radio on.Multiplayer is, as you'd imagine, even more fun than single player.  Plan your routes/plans/truck builds with your friends or stranger fellow-loggers.  Tow each other out of a bind, or follow your friend as a backup repair vehicle.  Accidental crashes into your fellows are often quite detrimental, and thus also fun and exciting.I know it sounds like a foolish and random concept.  Maybe it is, 'Russian logging game' didn't seem to appealing to me when I bought it and I had my doubts.  But now, I'm very glad I bought it, and I play it often.			"

												Great Game. I played the hell out of it in Dev mode before it was on steam. The only problem is the camera. The camera angle is the biggest peice of sh!t ever. Almost impossible to use. IT should have less loose movement and more solid movements with the mouse. And other features to get close to see what you are doing.			"

												The game is great, but it would be nice to see some more regular types of off road vehicles to use rather then the massive trucks. Also it would be very nice to have a basic in game save option rather then having to use that seperate launcher to save... But it is really a good game though, best off road game by far!			"

												Easy-Hardest maps. Plains < Coast < Volcano < The Hill < The River .River hardest only until you find good way to cross it then its alot easier. Great game 8/10.Only major issue is the camera,any driving game has to have 1st person view,the 3rd person could also use some improvements.I got game on sale for 10$ and its well worth that but not sure it has the content/customization to be worth the 30$ steam is still asking for it.BTW you can get this few other places for 15-20$ and its worth it.One minor thing i would like to mention is must be manual shift in hardmode,not sure why they made this it doesnt make it harder just annoying to me.
