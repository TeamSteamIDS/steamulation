												It's terrible. Even $2 is too much.The birds animations are garbage. They automatically swich directions.They spin and fall slowly. Early on you have bunchs of birds just flying over your head within a few meters. It makes no real sense.Aiming is not intuitive and often times the birds will just change directions when you release the arrow.Duck Hunt is more realistic.Don't bother, move along, find something better.
