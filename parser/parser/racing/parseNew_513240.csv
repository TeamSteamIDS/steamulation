												Needs a bit work. Menu is confusing but the superhero mode is cool and made a dream come true :]			"

												Cool little game for showcasing VR. I would definitely pick it up, especially at this price point.			"

												Spread your wings and fly like a... erm.. brick*.Bits of the menu fall right outside of my field of view.There is no turning or banking during flight.Want to change direction? Turn around or give your chair a good swing.This completely kills any feeling of immersion or flying.Your graphics card better have a turbo charged setting (with cupholders) or drawing of terrain will follow after you have flow... sorry hurtled over the bit of terrain that you are at.This still needs work.Mind you, the idea is nice.

												Eh... This was disappointing in pretty much every way.The graphics (and I feel generous just from using that term here) consist of a flat, low-res satellite image pasted onto some blocky geography.If you ever fly lower than a 1000ft, you're in for an eyesore.The wing flapping controls are clunky and broken so there goes the ""bird""-part of the title.Superhero controls are 'fine' in that they are at least functional.Overall, just a disappointing and annoying mess.

												This is seriously the worst vive game I have downloaded, even at free, this would be horrible.The control mechanism is poorly thought out, with no real feel that you are flying.  The graphics are horrible, the menu control system is rediculous.  At free it is a waste of time, charging for this is a joke.			"

												Now I gotta say... this game must be the DANKEST game I've ever played!  I mean, it's downright DANK AF!  If you like to fly, then F**K yeah you gonna wanna play this game!  The maps?  Sick.  The wings?  Sick.  The races?  Sick.  The concept?  Sick.  The graphics?  Sick.  THERE IS NO BETTER GAME OUT THERE!  This game is SO F**K'N DANK I had to buy a towel for it.  Seriously, it's a F**K'N STEAL at this price!  I'd pay $420 dollas for this game!  F**K!  It just doesn't get DANKER THAN THIS.  Buy this game, it's so dank.  Don't buy this game if you hate yourself and want to self-deprive out of some sick form of masochism.  I give this game, TEN OUTTA TEN.  So dank.			"

												I don't know what this scro Rembrant is talking about.  I felt like friggin superman flying through the grand canyon scoping nuggets to turn into diamonds.  I actually stood up and got out of my chair as the Vive was intended to be used.  I give this game 5 out of 5 danks for price and the fact that i get a workout while playing it.  Warning...  If you are anemic or out of shape this may not be the game for you.  If you want to get RIPPPED like a SCRO then DO IT!  JUST DO IT!  BUY THIS GAME!  How could a game that cost less than a Starbucks be the wrong move?			"
