Basic InformationTitle:  Power HoverStatus:  ReleasedDeveloper:  OddrockPublisher:  OddrockGenre:  Arcade RacerRelease Date:  10th of January, 2017Type:  Single-playerGeneral ImpressionPower Hover was a fun albeit difficult ride. It’s just what you’ve come to expect from an indie hybrid between an endless runner and a racer on Steam. Its developer has literally hit the ground running since they made a more than decent debut for a title sporting Unity Engine 5 assets in a minimalist style. More and more devs seem to find new uses for that game engine and we should all be grateful indeed.Surprisingly, this is a story-driven experience and not just a random succession of levels, even if the themes never repeat themselves a lot. You initially control just one robotic courier on a mission to restore electrical power to various parts of the game world. A task easier said than done since collecting the batteries needed to unlock different structures which produce electricity, will have you travelling at breakneck speed across desert plains, oceans, cityscapes or even purely abstract levels. And in order to make the challenge truly worthy for the veterans of this genre, obstacles either static or moving, will try to stop you constantly.Why is the game that difficult? Well for starters, I found that the game progression requires that you max out on the numbers of batteries you should collect during each individual level, if you really wish to power-up as many structures as possible and thus reap the rewards. Powerful boons, that will include even the possibility to unlock new controllable avatars or at the very least provide you with more “lives” or chances to start a level section at a checkpoint instead of restarting from the beginning of the stage. It certainly adds to the overall difficulty, the fact that you have a limited amount of retries as it is, and quick reflexes will have to be complemented by nerves of steel. More often than not, you may skip on grabbing a battery since you were too focused on the obstacle in front of you.Ironically almost, but for such a fast-paced game, patience is of far greater importance than the ability to quickly shift your hoverboard in the general direction of the scattered batteries. There are fortunately, many checkpoints along the routes you traverse. It won’t help by much but at least it gives you the chance to memorize some of the battery locations as well as the traps and occasional bombs which will instantly rob you of a precious life. Not even all obstacles can be learned by heart since in the “boss” levels, you have to quickly travel through elaborate laser beam patterns and vent blades for example. Not really something that you can rely on replicating with the same results, at a subsequent restart of the stage. So at least some degree of luck might also be necessary. I’m open to any gaming genre even if the ones that constantly require quick reflexes, aren’t among my favorites. I will still try to improve myself and overcome the not so favorable odds since rage quitting isn’t a worthy practice for any type of gamer. So even if a particular level might seem harsh, rest assured that there is most certainly at least one that’s far worse, as you advance the story. Keep playing and you might get good enough at it.The “Less is More” motto befits Power Hover wholeheartedly. The minimal looks are perfect for the type of gameplay that’s all about speed and precision. Game sounds are indeed repetitive, but considering  its legacy (initially a smartphone title), that is weak point we can safely overlook. I was expecting more achievements, but even as they are, I’m sure that collectors won’t be displeased. If you consider the game to be overpriced, then wait for a bundle or a Seasonal Sale. Other than that, Power Hover shows great promise, should its developers attempt a sequel.Strong Points+ Nice minimalist visual style.+ Diversified challenges and level design.+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards.Weak Points- Frustratingly difficult at times.- Repetitve sounds.Rating 75/100  This review was submitted for ReviewExperts, through the generous contribution of Daniël - REX ♥ Gaming.

Power HoverPower Hover is an adventure racing game which is a game essentially about robots with hoverboards and their quest. Does it stick to its route or falls down a cliff, let’s find out:Gameplay:Power Hover puts you in the shoes of a Robot with a hoverboard who is tasked to collect batteries and bring back power to the world. The story revolves around a city whose power source has been stolen and it went into complete blackout. You were tasked to chase down the thief and in the process bring back the power to the town. The gameplay of Power Hover is extremely simple, you slide left and right trying to avoid obstacles and collect batteries. But don’t be fooled by its simple aesthetic, the game throws a lot of difficult sections where you have to really test your skills. After you have completed the first couple of levels, you will be introduced to the thief who stole the power from the town. The game then tasks you with chasing down the thief and take back what’s yours. It is not really a race as there is no time limit and you won’t overtake the thief throughout the game. Then what purpose does he serve? Along the way, he drops batteries at difficult paths and you have to be on his trail if you want to collect them all. In between these batteries, he will sometimes drop a bomb or two in your way which bursts as soon as you pass through them. Initially it seems that the thief is merely more than another character on screen as his bombs are very easy to avoid. Slowly though he starts placing bombs right after a battery which makes it increasingly difficult to pass the levels. The game introduces you to new sections and obstacles in a very subtle way. Before you come toe to toe with the real thing, the game will tell you in a visual way how the machines or beasts work. All of this is told through environmental cues and you have to be careful about the environment you’re cruising through. The game also changes camera angles at correct times to give you a top down view for sections which are designed like mazes. The checkpoints are placed so that you can continue your journey after you have died without any sort of frustration. After each level you are awarded with stars which give you a specific amount of electricity which in turn unlocks buildings in the town which gives you various upgrades. After you unlock a specific amount of buildings with enough power you will unlock boss levels. Boss levels are endless levels which produce procedural generated machine madness in your way. They are much more difficult than the normal game and require you to accumulate a certain amount of points to unlock the next section of the city. Power Hover’s biggest challenge is not only passing through levels, but passing the levels while collecting the maximum amount of batteries. Not all is good with Power Hover though, there are sections in levels which have nothing inside them which makes those parts feel incredibly bland and boring. The story while told in an interesting way lacks originality. There are a few characters available to be bought through power but they are purely cosmetic and do not have any gameplay or visual incentive to be bought. The hover board itself is a major pain to control sometimes as it will spin out of control and will do whatever it wants. The game also suffers from a certain amount of bugs and glitches which makes some levels really frustrating. But overall, Power Hover is a game which is easy to learn but hard to master. VisualsPower Hover is very appealing and soothing to the eyes. The graphics have low polygon count but more than makes up for it with its gorgeous and varied world. The creatures of the world are created so that you will marvel at each and every sight. In fact, the game places a few puzzles just before something incredible happens on your screen which will leave you in awe and off guard. The game shows its world and tells its story through its visual design and it does a superb job at that. From sandworms to Giant spikes and mining monsters, everything is created so that you have a joy in exploring these levels. Truth be told, my main purpose for completing Power Hover’s levels were not about collecting batteries but to see what new wonders the game held next.SoundThe sound design of Power Hover is amazing. It compliments its visual design very well and has a soothing effect on ears. The soundtrack of Power Hover makes traversing its marvellous worlds all the more better. OverallPower Hover is a simple game with a superb visual aesthetic and sound design. There are a few problems you will encounter here and there but nothing will distract you from exploring its world. It is a very relaxing game and very easy to pick up and play. For its price, you can’t go wrong with Power Hover.

												This is a very well made game which is perfect for short play sessions. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a quick pick up and play game that feel unique and well polished.The game is very simple in terms of controls with just left and right needed to move the character, no jumping, no tricks just movement. The mechanic of chasing batteries is really well done and each level has a slight unique twist on the simple gameplay mechanic.I enjoyed the soundtrack of the game along with the very interesting cut scenes after each boss that explain the world and have some interactivity, very creative! For the cons, I had a few issues with the UI and I would of liked a sensitivity control for my controller as the dead zone was pretty sensitive. Also a few additional gameplay mechanics would of been nice for extended replay ability such as a trick system.Pros- Nice Clean graphics- Great soundtrack- Feels very polished- Unique levels and gameplay mechanicsCons- UI needs a little work with controllers- Limited gameplay mechanics- No control for sensitivityOverall I'd recommend this game if you are looking for something to play in short bursts.

												Power Hover is a nice game to play if you just want to sit, relax and listen to a pretty good low-key soundtrack. Art style is also pleasant and quite colorful. Gameplay is as simple as it gets because the hoverboard advances automatically. All you have to do is go left or right, in order to avoid obstacles or collect batteries. It takes a while to control the hoverboard without making stupid mistakes, but this doesn't really qualify as depth. This lack of depth is probably the game biggest weakness, even if the level design is somewhat varied. There are straightforward levels (from point A to point B on the ground) and some levels where you have to follow another boarder who drops bombs. You'll also have to rotate inside tunnels, and move around rotating beams. Finally, the ""boss"" levels are quite challenging. But in the end, you are still only pushing left or right. Enjoyed with time with Power Hover, but don't expect a meaty gaming experience. Note: Power Hover isn't a racing game.			"

												Power Hover is a really fun, minimalistic runner that completely surprised me.It's easy, the controls are a little slippery (but it's tight enough for it to work) but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is it fun.The game looks great for actually being a mobile port and it runs great, except for a few minor hiccups.Every stage felt super satisfying to go through, if you're looking for something fun to pass time with Power Hover is the perfect choice.If you're having trouble figuring out if the game is for you, check out the first 15 minutes of the game here

												When I first saw this game, I had to pick it up and see if it stood up to my expectations. I can certaintly say that this game has achieved and surpassed my expectations. Power Hover is a game where you ride in a hoverboard and has a simplistic control system of just the left and right arrow keys. I made a claim in my video review of the game that the developers should add in a/d controls because it would feel more natural. I was shocked to say the least when I actually got a notification on twitter from them saying that they would immplement it right away! I really love to get games from the smaller developers because of interactions like this. Then next point I want to get on is the soundtrack. I was stunned to hear it because It was both beautiful and stunning to hear. I never got tired of listening to the music as I was playing because It was so relaxing. The game itself isn't a rage game at all, It can be a bit challenging (especially if you want to 3 star everything) but the game was nevew meant to be rage inducing, but a game you can sit back, relax, and enjoy yourself.Next I can go onto the graphics. The graphics are very beautiful to say the least. They are simplistic, but not in a way that will hinder the playing experience. When I first started playing the game, I noticed the graphics right away (as do everybody else) and payed close attention to the small details. They really put a lot of thought when creating the graphics for this game! They payed attention to small things like the light from the hoverboard and the look of the worms from the early levels!Now that I got the most important positives of the game, I can now get into the only negative I have found in the game. The game can be a little confusing at first. When I got this game, I wanted to read what it was about to decide weither it would be a good game for my channel, and inside the description of the game it states ""Someone has stolen all the power from your robot village, but the track is still warm, hop on your hoverboard and get the energy back!"" But when I first got into the game, I noticed there wasn't a cutscene explaining why I was on the hoverboard in the first place. The first level however states ""The theif has dropped some batteries, follow the trail, collect the energy!"" Other than that I felt like there needed to be a little bit more on the whole story aspect.As you can see the Pros definitely outweigh the cons in this game. Needless to say is only $5.99 in the steam store as of the release sale ($7.99 off sale). If you have the extra $5 saved up, and are looking for a new game, Powewr Hover is the game for you.TL;DR portion Pros+Easy to learn controls+Beautiful Music+Amazing simplistic graphicsCons-Story explaining

												Powerhover is a simple yet challenging game in which you are a robot on a hoverboard. The only mechanic in the game is moving left or right. But this mechanic is compounded upon by tons of level hazards and challenges.The 35 levels are very varied, and have a great and cohesive artistic direction. You won't be feeling like you've played the same level twice. The levels are enhanced by the awesome soundtrack, which is seriously amazing. Most levels are a sort of challenge requiring precision and memorization. Some levels called ""boss levels""(a misnomer imo, there are no bosses) are procedurally generated and take out the ""memorization"" aspect and require good precision and fast reflexes.Each level introduces a different mechanic, such as rail grinding, giant snake worms or rockets shooting at you. There is always something to hold your interst.My major gripe with the game is the difficulty curve. Some levels you can breeze through and 100% on the first try, other might take 10-20 attempts. Though it doesn't ruin the game, it definitely hit me for a jolt when I thought I was getting the hang of the game and then I get my ♥♥♥ handed to me.Overall, a unique and fun experience that is full of challenge. The full game took me about 3 hours to beat, but there is also a challenge mode as well, which should add on another 45 minutes or so. I would not reccomend this game to people who don't like having to repeat a task to perfect it, or those who hate losing.			"

												Simple graphics yet they work suprisingly well. The music is really good and relaxing. Feels like a nice chillout game. Simple controls just moving left and right but it can be suprisngly tricky at times! The boss battle was fun since every time you restart it randomly generates the level.			"

												Looking at the game can just say how much fun this will be, it's simply beautiful, it looks pleasing to the eye with it's colorful scheme and the smooth shapes spread all over the place, it's smooth, it's clean and the simple control scheme is perfect.Very simple gameplay, yet challenging enough to keep you playing over and over again till you complete the set of 30+ Levels, the game itself is simple, you're a hoverboarding portagonist, hovering your way through danger and collecting as much energy as you can.The only complain I have here is the story, how much better it could have been explained and shown throughout the game, everything else is perfect.I give this game a solid 8/10			"

												Really fun, relaxing game which shouldn't be taken too seriously. The controls take a little getting used to, and the rails need some more polishing, but the core gameplay is entertaining. One thing I find great about the game so far is the camera work, it just feels so smooth and well made.It's a cool concept overall, some elements of the game seem a little bit like a ""mobile game"" like a power plant that you can regain lives from if you check on them every once in a while (I believe). A lot of the buttons overall feel pretty large, as you would find on mobiles,, the Start Screen buttons almost look like they forgot some padding on the bottom option, and the map does require you to pan around by dragging the mouse. But these are just little nit picks.It's a great game overall and i would recommend it to others!			"
