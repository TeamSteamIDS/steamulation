												SQUAKE is an online-only snake game with a simple power-up system.The core idea of adding multiplayer and power-ups to snake game is solid enough and the developer has been very active fixing bugs and minor issues so far. Unfortunately SQUAKE suffers from a few major flaws at the moment that make it lot less fun than it could be. First of all the steering controls (at least on a keyboard) are rather unresponsive. Not sure if it's just server lag or something else but it's rather annoying in any case.More importantly, the game doesn't have nearly enough players at the moment. I have never seen more than a few people playing each arena and this is simply not enough for enjoyable gameplay. The game does feature bot players too, but they are extremely stupid and provide pretty much zero challenge.Unfortunately I can't really recommend SQUAKE in its current state. If the developer can either attract more players or improve the bots I might give the game another chance in the future.I received a pre-release copy of game for free from a developer giveaway but this didn't affect my review.The good:- Nice ideaThe bad:- Desperately needs more players as the bots are terrible- Unresponsive keyboard controls- Not a big fan of some of the game modes/arenas- Very basic audio			"

												TL;DR:The good:- Nice multiplayer Snake-gameplay - Good graphics- Many game modes and maps- Quests for when you get bored from playing the game normally- Progression system in which you get to upgrade your train with coins won in-game.The bad:- Barely any players online. Most games filled with very dumb bots- Gamepad controls too sensitive. Kept registering movement in the main menu even though there was none. Fixed by the devs.---Addictive and fun multiplayer Snake game with multiple game modes and quests. I feel like I can play this for hours and not get bored by it. The graphics look great, the gameplay is fun and the controls...work. To be honest, my controller kept moving into directions even when I didn't press anything which kind of sucked. Might be too sensitive since even the slightest touch gets registered. Navigating the menu becomes annoying that way, but ingame, it is quite fine. This is no  longer an issue.Would be cool if there where more players, though. There are so many maps and a lot of gamemodes, but half of the teams are filled with dumb bots because no one is currently playing. Makes me sad. If you get bored from playing the game normally, you can do the quests to earn extra coins in order to upgrade your train or buy cosmetics. A nice progression system to keep you motivated to play, even if just a little.Verdict: You should definitely try this game out. It's a lot of fun if you can get to play with real people and not just bots.			"

												Squake a fun, easy and yet addictive gamebut what is squake? well its snake set in an online arenaall you do is collect different color gems or powerups what can give advantages and disadvantagessounds boring?well then comes the online arena in to place with different game modes like:Domination: be the longest for a period of 1:30 once your timer hits 0 you winDynamite: bring your color dynamite to your base and get your counter to 0 before the other team doesCapture the flag: like Dynamite 2 teams but now its bring the flag to the other sideand a few others its called snake combined with quake although you cant shoot in this game you have to try to crash your oponents into the wall or into you so you can keep dominating the gamewhile playing you earn ingame coins with that you can unlock higher level powerups that you pick up in the game the higher level only means that the power up you picked up lasts longer or you can change your exhaust smokeall in all a very fun game with a few minor bugs like spawning inside a sawblade what means instant death lol			"

Thank you to the developer for supplying me with a key to re-review SQUAKE after the problems I had with this title were apparently addressed. At the bottom you will find my original review, unedited, for clarity.---Yes, nearly all of my 'cons' or issues with the game were addressed. That much is true. SQUAKE does manage to pull off the feeling of a mashup of Snake and QUAKE fairly well. Is it fun? It's ok. To be blunt, it's not as good as Slither.io - and I make that judgement because time-and-again I find myself over at Slither.io, while not so much here with this title. I do enjoy playing SQUAKE to a certain extent, and I cannot deny that. SQUAKE is much faster paced, and the levels are small. I am changing my review to positive because the title accomplishes what it sets out to do, and the dev team is dilligent about addressing criticism and are open to changing things. +The controls have been fixed+The hitboxes feel much more appropriate now+So far, reset trains have not been in questionable locations (ie. in front of a wall, etc.)-Sound effects are still 'meh', but that's probably a budget limitation thang-Powerups are still lackluster, but whateverWill you get your five bucks worth? Sure, but just know that while doing what it sets out to do, SQUAKE is quite small in scope.---I was hoping that SQUAKE was an upgraded version of the fantastic Slither.io, but sadly, it is much less polished and balanced. I do appreciate that the devs wanted to take the base idea of Slither.io and create a more fast-paced game. That idea is very cool, but the execution is quite off.What they got right:+Interesting idea to make Sliter.io a bit more fast-paced with powerups and meta-upgrades.+Unfortunately controller support here is poor - but it does exist.What needs improvement:-I can only describe the controls as 'squirrelly'. If you are used to Sliter.io, you will initially feel like the game is in fast-forward. That part makes sense (ie. mixing concepts with QUAKE). The problem I found was with turning. It just felt too sudden and too wiley.-After death, your train is often reset in really questionable locations - often I was directly in front of a wall. Yes, I could swerve right away to miss it, but why put me in this position? I had many, many deaths due to that. Questionable design decision at best.-Hit boxes with walls are a bit too liberal. Since the game is so simple, these small issues add up quickly. Near perfect design is what made Slither.io so popular to begin with.-Sound effects are kind of annoying. The train sound is monotonous even after a short while. So how do we fix this? Remove those sounds or have them play intermittantly. I get that the budget is not unlimited for these things - again, look at Slither.io for good minimalistic-ish game design. Sometimes less is more.-Power ups are a great idea and would be a nice addition if they were a bit more inspired. These are as basic as they can get. By the way, the powerup that reverses your steering should be removed, in my opinion. Does it really add fun?-One of the coolest strategic design elements of Slither.io is the ability to cross over your own tail. They have eliminated that here, and it dramatically reduces strategy. I get that this is in-part the SNAKE component, but it simplifies things too much.-The levels or arena is quite small. Too small for this type of game.I do appreciate the effort and investment in producing a good, purchasable Slither.io here on Steam. I am also excited about various quality-of-life upgrades (ie. controller support, meta upgrades, etc.). Unfortunately, SQUAKE isn't there yet - and it could get there if more TLC is invested. The price is cheap, but I'll stick with Slither.ioPeace,			"

												I received the game for free on Reddit by the dev himself (before the official release). I sent an inbox to him about the review, with the good and the bad of the game.I played it two days ago, and wow, it looks much more polished. I loved the inclusion of the actions, I like that you can upgrade the time power ups last (although I think that once the game has a lot of active players, they should be matchmake with other players with similar power-up levels, otherwise it's not very balanced)Speaking of the game, I love it. I loved bug wars (frozen throne mini game) and I love Squake. I wished there were more active players though. I had the chance to play with two other players at the same time and I had a blast. The controls are good enough, but I encountered two bugs playing the game.1. The car goes crazy, goes left and right.2. The car explodes and I die, no crash, no anything.Anyway, I would like to see what more can be added to the game, I think it has potential to be a great fun multiplayer to play for one hour or half an hour everyday, to relax.

												Already wrote a review but i wanted to go more in-depth on the pros/cons of the game, so i deleted it and i'm starting over.Pros:This game has alot of potential, and i feel like the developers have put alot of work into it. The mechanics of the game is very to get a hang of, it'll take you 2 minutes tops to learn all of the basics. If you want a game that is easy to pick up and fun at the same time, i haven't found a better one than this. There's a good variety of gamemodes, you don't feel like you're playing the same game sometimes because of the different ways of playing in the different gamemodes. For instance, in CTF you might play more defensive, but in demolition you could play more offensive.It's not pay2play. There's not any in-game purchases for real cash, which makes the player more dependant on raw skill rather than money.If there's a low amount of players online, bots will take their place. And here we're talking about bots that knows how to play the game. They aren't braindead bots that doesn't know how to play the game at all, good work on the programming of them.Cons:There's not too many players active. Definitely needs a bit of advertising / promoting. Sometimes you spawn directly looking at a wall / rotor blade thingy (very good at english as you can see) which pretty much just kills you instantly. We need a use for Battle Points. IIRC there's no point of BP except for showing off your profile. Maybe make it some sort of currency to buy different types of cars or something?Overall:The game is one of the better indie games out there, it's definitely worth its low price and i highly recommend it.8.8/10			"

												If you like ""io"" games, this product is definitely for you! That's the best of that type of games. When I start playing it i can't  stop. It's better when you are with a friend. If he or she is in your team you can make tactics together.  If your mate is your enemy-just troll him as you destroy his train. :D Now for the purpose and the content of the game.  Maybe you understood that you are a train. The main task is to collect dropped items on the arena. There are 4 mods in the game: 1)""Stay longest for 90s to win""- Your aim is to be first with the most points in the table for 90 seconds. The points are earning through collecting the dropped items. 2)""Collect dynamites and drag them to your base""-That's my second favorite mod in the game. That's the competitive in ""SQUAKE"". There are two teams-blue and red and you have to get the dynamites of your color and drag them in your base. At the same time you have to destroy enemy's trains and to stop them dragging their dynamites. The first team to collect 70 dynamites wins. It's really fun to play it with your friends or just with a random players. 3)""Just a big world for many players""- This mod is made just for fun. You are travelling in the arena to collect items and trying to be first in the table. But the powers are making the game special. There are 6 types of powers which you can collect through the game. They're helping you to win easier. With the coins you receive in the game and after the game, you can upgrade your powers. There is also something like ""skins"" in the game. They are actually smokes which makes your train looks more beautiful (you buy the smokes again with coins). 4)""Capture the flag""- That's my favourite mod. As you can guess your purpose is to get the flag before your enemy and to bring it to your base. So, my final evaluation is 10/10. The game is VERY good and i hope the developers are gonna make it better. REALLY good job for On5. Keep going! ;) "

												Note: I received SQUAKE for free from the developer and chose to review it. OVERVIEWSQUAKE (all caps) is a multiplayer arena battle game based on the classic 'Snake' game.Rather than a snake, in SQUAKE you control a weird snake-train thingy that gets longer as you pick up extra carriages from the floor of the arena, but if you're familiar with Snake, you'll pick up SQUAKE pretty quickly.GraphicsSQUAKE's graphics are great! The little snake-train thingies speed around, blowing smoke from their engines, exploding, and leaving nice, smokey trails behind them. Arena graphics include large blades and attractive little large-particle fire pits.I did find the arenas a bit confusing at first -- particularly the bunkers -- as they look quite busy, but once I worked out which parts I could enter, and which lines on the background were just part of the background and which ones represented walls that would kill me, I got the hang of it pretty quickly.Graphics options seem to be non-existent: I couldn't find any settings whatsoever. The game starts in full screen mode ran well on a new gaming laptop.SoundThere's no music, which I found a bit odd, except for a little ditty at the end of each level. The title/lobby screen could really do with some music, and background music for the levels wouldn't go astray either.Sound effects are acceptable. There's nothing special about them, but nothing cringe worthy either.GameplaySQUAKE plays like Snake. It's that simple.There are additions to the classic game, of course, and I don't just mean the pretty graphics. It's multiplayer, for a start, with each arena populated with a host of other snake trains for you to avoid or destroy as you desire. It also has a few different game modes, including carting dynamite to your opponent team's base, and trying to hold the title of longest snake train for a set period of time. And there are collectibles -- buffs and debuffs -- and upgrades and levels and all that sort of goodness. But it's still basically Snake, and that's not a bad thing, because anyone can pick it up and play it, and even with no instructions or tutorials it should only take you a few minutes to grasp what you have to do in each arena.The developers have added tasks to try to keep you interested and increase the replayability, too. The game includes up to three seemingly random challenges available at once, which include things like creating a train of only one colour of a certain length, finishing in the top three of a designated game mode, or dynamiting a base a certain number of times. These provide you with credits, which you can then spend on upgrades, which either increase buff times or decrease debuff times, giving you a slight edge against other players. There are also pretty smoke effects that can be purchased with credits, but these may only be active for a limited time -- I'm not sure.The real let down for SQUAKE is that it's online only -- even when only playing against bots -- and the ping is terrible. When I first started playing I thought the controls were very weird, with significant lag between when I pressed a key and the movement on screen of my snake. I also noticed that I'd crash into other snakes that weren't there anymore, and collision detection just seemed a bit off. Then I noticed the ping reported in the bottom left. I don't know where the servers are located, but playing from Australia I had a pretty constant 375 ms -- more than double what I get with pingtest.net to a USA server, but just about right to Western Europe, so I can only assume there's only one server farm, and it's somewhere there. From reading the Steam Community Discussions for the game it looks like I'm not the only one, either, as a number of people have posted that their ping times make it unplayable. This really needs to be addressed in an online-only game like SQUAKE, where a third of a second makes a huge difference in whether you manage to keep building up your 100-odd carriage snake train or you're just another explosion trailing smoke in your wake.I can see why the developers have gone with an online-only approach, and it does make for a seamless transition when new players join or leave a game, but it does mean that the ping issue becomes important for bot games as well. And in a bit over an hour of play so far, I've only managed to play a game with one other person, even though there are apparenty ""11 Online"" in one of the game modes right now.Other than the very high ping, which is definitely a problem, but not really a bug as such, I found two issues that I would call bugs, although these were both in an earlier version of the game and may have been fixed now. The first was a crash to desktop in the middle of dropping off dynamite in the bunker arena. My 'snake' was long and made up of both colours of dynamite, and a blade cut through the middle part way through the drop off, so I'm guessing that was what caused the crash. The other was seemingly random rebounds off of nothing, where my snake would change direction suddenly for no reason in the middle of an arena. I suspect this latter issue was somehow due to the high ping.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Easy to pick up and play+ Very addictive+ Pretty graphics+ In-game challenges and Steam Achievements to keep you playing+ Trading cardsCons:- High ping makes playing more frustrating than it should be- Only limited game modes and arenas- Not enough information on server populations, locations, pings, etc.- No way to customise your in-game name or 'snake head' appearanceCONCLUSIONSQUAKE is actually a lot of fun, it's just a shame that the high ping makes it so much harder to play than it should be, even in single-player mode, since the developers have opted for online only. If it weren't for this I'd be happy to recommend SQUAKE as a fun casual game that anybody can play. Instead, I'm much more hesitant. Recommended, but only if you can be sure you'll have a good ping.6/10 "

												I really appreciate that the game has different modes but they are gated to start for no reason. The devs were smart to put in bots as that fills in the missing players, it helps a little. Be warned though because the bots are not helpful or hard to play against. I think the upgrades are unfair to new players which is different from the nature of this hop in/out type of game.The best you could hope for is if you got a group of friends to play but most of the modes have room for a lot of people so I hope it's a lot of friends!I made a video:

												Multiplayer modernized Snake with quests, upgrades, etc. It is fun, and the devs are very kind and helpful.			"

												SQUAKE is really addicting game and for now is regularly updated, which means that developers care about the game. Also as what I saw, they do care about the feedback from their users. Its cool that I got the game for free, but in my opinion if the game was free to play it would have much more players in it. Or for example some regular giveaways from the ton of giving away websites would increase the playerbase.Surely it would be much fun with friends.			"

												Pros:-Addictive/Fun gameplay- Good graphics- Power-ups add to the gameplay- Trading cards- In game challengesCons:- Very few players (at the moment)- $5.99 seems fairly high for what you’re getting- Very little music- Occasional server lag that makes the game pretty unplayable- Steering is alright but could be improved- Some issues displaying who is actually winning- No local multiplayer/split screen- Lacking in tutorials (although it is pretty easy to figure out)Overall I think SQUAKE is a fun entertaining game that I really enjoy playing. The cons really do start to outweigh the pros however. I think the biggest con is that there are hardly any players whenever I try to find a game. This isn’t really the devs fault though, and thankfully the game has bots you can “play” with. (The bots are pretty stupid and usually end up driving into a wall) I think that if they added split screen it might be a bit more fun but it might also be more difficult to play. The price of $5.99 seems a little high for the product currently. I received the game for free, and if I hadn’t I don’t think I would buy it for the price it’s at now. I haven’t tried too many of the game modes yet but so far domination is my favorite. Some of the other game modes/maps aren’t as fun in my opinion. Some of the obstacles/doorways need to be defined more because you can hit the edge of something and die without realizing how close you are. I’m going to recommend SQUAKE but maybe get it on sale or wait to see how the game improves in the future since it’s a pretty recent title. Choo Choo!			"

												This is a pretty fun game, and I recommend it. It has fun graphics, and adds interesting elements and objectives to the old ""Snake"" game that I played as a youngster. I think it would be a really fun split-screen local co-op game, but it was fun enough playing around with just the AI trying to get a feel for the game.			"
