												This game is kinda bad, it feels extremely choppy and it's showing high framerates, the bike physics and mechanic really suck. If you're looking for a MX game look into THQ's MX vs ATV, much better game.			"

												This is a fun game when you play it for what it is. I really enjoyed the time I put into it. The game plays much different than any of the current Motocross racing games and it shouldn't be compared to them because of this reason. You can't play this game expecting it to play like the MX vs ATV series or MXSIMULATOR, this is a racing game on dirt bikes, not a simulator. The single stick driver controls feel dated when comparing it to MvA Reflex, but the controls work for this game. The scrubing feature feels great, even though the animation does look a little wonky when it comes back. But the way it plays is nice in the game and you'll be spotting your landing on the way back not staring at the animation.I never got a chance to play online against other players, that would have been very interesting. The AI gives you a good run from time to time, but nothing like another human player would. If you're looking for a fun, good looking dirt bike racing game I would suggest this game. The Tour mode is like a career mode where you level your rider up, get new gear, better teams, etc... I really enjoyed playing this mode. My only complaint is that you're not able to put your name and rider number on your rider, these are assigned for you. Overall I would give this game a 7\10 and I suggest that any fan of dirt bike videos games give it a chance.			"

												I dont recommend this game because it is so cartoony and i reget getting it you are better off with mx vs. atv. you have to buy tricks! you should just learn them not buy the tricks. i have had this game for about 1 hour and i reget everything about this game. if you want a dirt bike game... MX VS. ATV not this crappy mud game.			"

												Ew, awful game. Dumb silly things like boosts and only being able to ""scrub"" on certain jumps. Overall, if you want an excellent motocross game, ANY MX vs ATV game will suffice. Literally any of them. To drive the point home, REFLEX : 10/10, Supercross : 9/10. Unleashed : 10/10, MXGP : 7.5 / 10, MUD : 3/10. I'm so happy i was able to get a refund.			"

												Okay, I couldn't help feeling the Mud Motocross was quickly done and the colour vision is overpowered, The bike's physics effects is a bit lame, So it's not really worth the money ,I suggest you should try get this on the cheap !If you love MX vs ATV Relex surely you're going to be a little disappointed with this in comparsions ,apart from that it's quite good actually !After being played a couple of weeks, i really like it a lot...:)			"

												Game does not work. It crashes on the race load screen.  .......................................................................................................................................................Ok going back and reading some stuff online for some reason this game is crashing on the race load screen for alot of people and the only way to fix it is to turn the audio off in the initial load screen. I guess this game would be alright if it actually functioned and had some kind of support. the graphics are ok and it supports controller play.			"
