												100 % recomended. Top 10 Reasons are; in no particular order.....1 - $45 AU gets you the full game with loads of content. No more to pay.2 -  Mods galore ! over 400 tracks , more than 120 car mods, and most are very high quality.3 - Frame rates are impresive. My R9 290x cards smash 200 + FPS with max everything and 28 cars on track.4 - FFB is easy to setup and feels great !5 - Day / night transition during race is posible and totaly cool.6 - Being an Australian the SuperV8's are the most fun i have had in my 25+ year Sim Racing Hobby. They are sensational cars to drive and GSCE have nailed it.Combined with the Historic V8 skin pack, racing Peter Brock, Allan Moffat, ♥♥♥♥ Johnson, Mark Skaife, Garth Tander, the kelly brothers, Craig McLouchlan, and even Neil Crompton , Just to mention a few,  around an excellent version of Bathurs was well worth the entry fee alone. Bloody sensational.7 - By Far the best AI in the business, once you find your skill  level. Close hard racing. Amazing.8 - The option for manual pit stops and strategies adds presure and excitment.9 - Constantly evolving. The next update due in the next month promises great things.10 - IMO, the most overall complete Sim as far as features go.There is more but i drive faster than i type.			"

												Well, i have this game for 1,5 years now (tranferred to steam on 11/02/2015), and its progress during this years was amazing. I must say that at the moment this game is the best offline sim racer out there, but Assetto Corsa is getting better and better, but as I said in the moment it is the best. It is a must have for all the sim racers out there, and now that it is on Steam is much easier to stay updated and get all the cars and tracks that the developers release.The physics is awesome, the graphics is awesome, 60fps.Another great factor about this game is that the tracks are extremely good. I say that because my city's racetrack is in this game (Londrina), and i've been there countless times and it is exactly the same as it is on real life!!!! So that is it, a very short review. And if you are a sim racer you MUST HAVE this game just like rFactor 1 and 2, Assetto Corsa, and iRacing.PS: the must have sim racers are (in my opinion) Assetto Corsa, Stock Car Extreme, rFactor 1 and 2 and iRacing.PS 2: as i said it is the best OFFLINE sim racer AT THE MOMENT, we all have to agree that the best ONLINE is iRacing.

												Possibly one of the most underrated racing sims out there. Been driving it since it first came out back in 2013.- Good physics engine although outdated (rfactor 1 engine).- Very good ffb.- Multiplayer is dead but the good AI makes up for this.- Cheaper than most popular sims (rfactor 2, Assetto Corsa) with a good amount of content.- Regular updates with free DLC and general improvements to the core game.Hopefully it will gain some popularity now that it's on Steam. Definitely worth picking up if you're into sim racing.(There's also a 60 minute demo which you can download from the site).			"

												Simply the best racing sim I have ever played. I have been addicted to it ever since it was released a few years ago.Every one of the various cars is a pleasure to drive. The closed cockpit of the V8 Stock cars is superb. Turn off all assists and the speed of the Formula V12 dares you to even blink, the Formula Extremes demand good throttle control in & out of turns, and in the words of James Hunt, you can go fast in the Formula Retro if you've got big balls. I've enjoyed race sims since Indy 500 by Papyrus in the '80's, but the greatest for me was Geoff Crammond's F1GP - it had all the rules, scoring, tyre strategies, and excellent AI. I waited for something that would finally match it, but each time a new game was released, there was always something letting it down.Until now.Stock Car extreme is based on the GMotor engine, i.e the same as rFactor, Race07, GTR and others, but it is without doubt a racing sim in it's own right.The Reiza devs have got inside the original code and amended it here and there (and they are still working on this so further updates & enhancements are possible), and in my opinion, the car handling, track grip characteristics, sounds and Force Feedback are the best I have found in any race sim.Yes, I know there are games with more 'state of the art' graphics, but that does not detract from the detail that has gone into each track and car in this sim, and the way Reiza have kept udpating the game and adding to the cars & tracks at no extra cost is an example to all software developers.There's a wide selection of cars, from Brazilian touring, to Mini, to Formula cars of all eras, to karting. All of them have their own unique character, and they really convey the excitement and exhilaration of racing at high speed. When you're on the limit, trying to shave another hundredth off your lap time, if you should drop a wheel onto the grass and lose control, you might sometimes find yourself taking your hands off the wheel and bracing for the impact.The game is also very moddable, so you can paint the cars, edit the drivers and teams, create your own custom championships, and use third party cars and tracks, and there are many of them available on the web.All of this means I can build the championship of my choice, for the best offline racing currently available.It does have it's weaknesses, the main one being the lack of awareness of blue flags by the AI, and to be fair, this is yet to be implemented efficiently in any other sim. This problem only becomes evident if you are into longer races, such as full distance F1 races, but with some clever tweaking of the driver talent files, power and braking spread of the cars, and the aggression levels, it is possible to have the leaders lapping the backmarkers without much delay, and achieve great offline AI behaviour.Others will cite rF2 and Assetto Corsa as being more advanced, especially graphically, but for me they are still way short of being the complete package, and they just do not offer the true driving feel that I get from this sim.Stock Car extreme is the sim that finally stands up to the Geoff Crammond series.

												tl,dr: SCE has tons of great content and compelling gameplay and is worth your time and money.When I first saw Stock Car Extreme on Steam, I thought it seemed like something that wouldn’t interest me. “Stock Cars” mostly means NASCAR in the US, and I don’t like that kind of racing. And “Extreme”? Huh?It turns out the “Stock Car” comes from the Stock Car Brasil series which is similar to DTM. The “Extreme” is from Reiza’s (the developers) connection to “Cockpit Extreme Racing” which is a line of sim-racing cockpit products. I have forgiven the somewhat puzzling name.After reading some reviews and watching some YouTube videos, I tried the demo found on Reiza’s website (actually based on the 2012 version) and it clicked with me right away, so I uninstalled it and bought the game.SCE packs impressive content right there in the box. As of right now, there are 62 tracks included with the game. Most of these are located in South America or are historic versions of tracks from around the world. I think that is very cool. These are excellent circuits that are new to me, but aren’t contrived “fantasy” circuits. (Reiza knows how to make them look absolutely beautiful, too.)For me personally, not seeing Spa, for example, is a little refreshing. I do really like that track, but seems that almost every racing game these days has the same core set of famous tracks while there is so much else to see. SCE supports tons of existing mods as well as SCE-specific mods, so you’re sure to find just about any track or car you like anyway. Even though SCE is named after the Stock Car Brasil series, it offers many other classes of cars ranging from 1976 F1 cars to the Metalmoro prototype to Karts to 2014 F1 cars and more. Each class feels so different from the next that you are offered a very broad range of driving experiences.Scroll up and look at the list of DLC. Hint: it isn’t there. Reiza is continually updating the game and providing new content for free. New tracks and cars just show up in the game updates. For free.SCE has fantastic gameplay. Most sims these days have convincing vehicle physics and SCE is right up there with the best of them.• The engine, tires, and road sounds are all well done and sound great. Some of the metal-on-metal scraping sounds aren’t great, but everything else is really good.• The AI behave realistically and they make realistic mistakes, just like anyone. With the default and most appropriate aggression setting, they won’t crash into you like a dumb human, but will pass you when it’s proper to do so.• The force feedback effects are very good, but can be inadvertently ruined a little by the user if the controller settings are wrong outside of the game. There is a guide on the official Race Department forum for setting up your wheel. Once you have it set up properly, though, the FFB effects are as good as you’ll find anywhere.• There is a 24-hour cycle present in the game, so if you start an evening race (which looks fantastic), you may end up finishing in the dark.• The game modes are the usual simulation kinds of modes: there is Single Race, Testing, Championship, and of course Multiplayer. There are no “challenge” style events or modes. Just the kind of racing you might have in the real world.The in-game options let you tweak all the things you’d expect, but if you dive into the various config files, you can really tweak everything to exactly what you want. For example, I have my track map going the full height of the monitor, but only within the leftmost 20% of the screen. I also have the sectors of the track on the map display in different colors.There are many in-game options you can change while in the garage, without having to go back to the main menu like some other titles.SCE will likely work on whatever computer you happen to have. Because it utilizes the original rFactor engine (though you wouldn’t guess by looking), it is really light on system requirements. It’s almost guaranteed that anyone can get high framerates in SCE. It looks very good, but of course it doesn’t look as sugary-sweet-beautiful as Assetto Corsa or Project Cars, but sim racing is about more than just pretty pictures, isn’t it?One drawback I could scratch up is that the interface in the menus looks dated and stretched by default. There is an easy to install mod (literally just replacing a folder) that makes the front-end much nicer and easier to navigate.Also, it really works best with a wheel. You don’t need an expensive force-feedback setup, but a wheel (even non-FFB) will give you a better experience than a gamepad. When I first got SCE, I tried my Xbox360 controller and a Saitek P990 and never really got the settings dialled in very well like you might have in a Codemasters game.The gamepads were just a little too twitchy, so I dug my 16-year-old Microsoft Sidewinder Wheel (non-FFB, 200-degree-rotation) out of the garage, and it was so good. I played SCE with that wheel for a couple of weeks before the game compelled me to buy my G27.Stock Car Extreme is definitely worth buying whether you’re only interested in trying simulation racing or if you already have a collection of sim titles.

												Stock Car Extreme is easily one of the greatest racing sims on the market. Reiza have pushed the gMotor engine to its absolute limit and the outcome is wonderful. The fact that the game has been updated constantly since release is a testament to Reiza's dedication. If you're looking for a great racing sim, you can't do much better than this. There is a wide variety of vehicles to choose from, whether you’re looking for formula cars, touring cars, or even the surprisingly fun go-karts, their all represented wonderfully here. The force feedback is sublime and the general physics of the cars is extremely well done.AI is another accomplishment, it genuinely feels like you’re racing against other people, which helps to provide some thrilling offline racing.  Hopefully with the Steam release, we’ll see some more online activity.The game is also very moddable and thus allowing you to use a wide variety of downloadable cars and tracks which you can find online.  You really can't go wrong here, it's a must buy for sim racing fans.			"

Stock Car Extreme is a fun realistic racing simulator with lots of content. There is a wide variety of cars and maps to choose from and to play in. The game itself isn't really a game at all but more a simulator for people who really want to race cars but don't have the chance to do so! It's overall a nice game and you can see it has a lot of effort put into it. Everything about each car type is very realistic.  Positives: +Lots of maps and map verity is great.+Lots of car types.+Very realistic driving.+AI to race against.+Different game modes.+Lots and lots of in depth game options to change the way your car works.+Plenty of neat features that most other racing games don't have. Example: Manual gear switching. Negatives: -Engine is over a decade old so the graphics aren't the best (but are not terrible).-Keyboard and mouse don't really work with the game.-No tutorial.-Main Menu is in the wrong resolution.-Keyboard&Mouse support is pretty bad. Both: +&- Not really a game, more of just a realistic simulator.Overall I rate this game a  7/10  pick it up ONLY if you have a controller and remember it's more of a realistic simulator than an actual racing game, so if you are a hardcore racing car lover be sure to pick this up!

												I've been playing Game stock car extreme for well over a year now, before it got on steam, so my current gametime might not say much.After F1 2013 I felt I needed to get serious with simracing. I tried rfactor 1 & 2 at first, and then Assetto Corsa. So I didn't have a lack of sims. It flew under my radar at first, but I kept hearing it's a really good sim so I went ahead and bought. Boy, what a great purchase. The amount of content is amazing. Formula classic, based on turbo-era F1 cars, Formula Retro, based on 70s era F1 cars, Formula reiza for V8 formula 1 cars, stock cars, old stock cars, carts, and what have you. And the tracks were awesome and high quality too. I might not have known all these brazilian tracks, but they are fantastic. Plus, with the modding community, you have a huge amount of pre-existing mods for cars and tracks (also mods that can be converted from rfactor 1). On top of that, we've had a constant stream of content updates, completely free, adding even more cars and tracks (Current 2014 spec formula 1 cars, V12 formula 1 cars, formula vee, a friggin prototype (!) ). This astounding amount of content has not been matched anywhere in simracing, I believe. It's amazing. And the quality of amazing. I am yet to be disappointed in a car's quality. I really don't know how else to say this. The bang-for-buck ratio is 100000000:1. The AI makes for perfect practice and great racing. I used it to get ready for online simracing. My first online race was in this game.The online community is very much active, and the races are great. My greatest online racing moments were in this game.If you are into simracing, and are wondering if this is a good purchase, or if it stacks up against rfactor 1/2 / Assetto Corsa, trust me, it is the best friggin purchase in the simracing world right now, in my opinion.10/10  "

												Well, to start, I have to say this is Hands Down the Best racing sim I have ever played.I've had the game for about a week now and cannot bring myself to even touch AC, PCars, RF2. The cars feel so much better in GSCE than anything on the market.Graphics - 7/10 (this is something that isn't even noticable while driving - the graphics may be slightly dated but are still             very nice)FFB - 11/10  Nothing compares - not even close. This is the best ffb I have ever experienced. I can tell what the car is doing at all times. I have never felt this level of detail in any sim,AI - 10/10 Again the best I've seen. While having the ability to adjust the AI's skill and aggressiveness I have found them more than a pleasure to compete against at levels from 90 -105 (this is the only range I've used thus far). They act like real drivers not parading in a line riding a rail, not playing bumper cars or cutting the track. They are absolutely awsome.Car selection - 8/10 enough to keep you busy. May not be the biggest selection of cars but I have yet to race half of them. Can't get myself off the 2013-2014 stock cars .Sound - 9/10 The sound of the cars is very immersive. Sounds like you are actually there.Physics - 10/10 Everything feels dead on here. I'm no race car driver but I feel like one - that should count for something.Multiplayer - placeholder (I have yet to try this against real people yet - the Ai is keeping me company at the moment)Triple screen support - 8/10 I maybe wrong but I cannot find a way to adjust the bezel angle, but it still works great with triple monitors.There are also tons of mods available for this title- tracks, cars and just about anything else you can think of. Everything you can use for RFactor is available here too.Final thoughts: If you're  like me and looked at this title on steam, debated on whether or not you needed another sim only to pass it by and visit it again later - then stop it. BUY the game already. There is no chance you will look back after you spent the first hour on it. Plus the Devs are about to add a whole bunch of new content including updating the graphic improving the already more than perfect FFB (not sure how it can be better, but looking forward to it), adding more cars, trucks, dirt tracks and more.Just buy the game			"

												The first sim i bought for the pc was Race the WTCC game. which was about 4 or 5 years ago. I wasnt massively into sim racing then, it was just something i'd occasionally do, and i bought a cheap wheel and pedal set. Main reason i bought Race07 was coz i was into the BTCC and the WTCC in Race were the same cars (not exactly the same, but similar performance though some cars were in the BTCC that were the same such as the BMW 320 si).A few years later i bought ETS2 and decided i wanted to play that properly with a proper good wheel so bought a G27, which was great. Not long before i bought this wheel i bought my second racing sim, Assetto Corsa but i was hardly playing it, mainly due to the steering rotation limit on the cheap wheel i had and i still wasnt into sim racing that much. It was the G27 that really got me into it then as i thought i'd try Race07 and AC with the new wheel and boy did i love it, the FFB and everything, felt great. So ever since i've been mostly just playing racing sims and went on to buy others such as GTR2, Raceroom Racing Experience, and iRacing which is subscription based.One day i saw Stock Car Extreme, and by the sound of the name i thought it was some arcadey type play around game not worth a second look...but it was recommended to me in steam, so i gave it a look and saw so many positive reviews and i watched the videos and liked what i saw, couldnt believe it was a proper sim going by the name of it. So i ended up getting it and i can honestly say that despite the amount of different sims i have, i play this the most by far, in just offline racing as it is great. The physics, the FFB are spot on, despite the old graphics i've been loving it and i'm playing it the most despite paying a subscription for iRacing, along with the content on Raceroom.Now i said that touring cars such as the WTCC as what i like the most so i should really be playing Raceroom the most as that simulates them and has the official cars from 2013 (and now 2014) but theres just something about Stock Car Extreme that i love so much with just the physics and FFB and it has such a great range of different series including multiple types of karts and different eras of F1.I so highly recommend this game and hope everyone makes a contribution to Reiza studios' recent crowdfunding campaign. They deserve it with making such a great sim and adding so much content for free which for games like iRacing and Raceroom would cost you, per car and track, so buy this game you wont be disappointed and make a contribution so Reiza can push it beyond extreme whilst they work on their new sim, which i'm drooling over the thought of!10/10The only negative which is a downer for me is the championship scoring isnt implemented correctly and seems to be bugged, but Reiza have said they'll rectify this, even though it has been a while now but hopefully soon they'll have a permanent fix for it.

												The best racing simulator I had the opportunity to drive in. Physics are really close to real world and graphics are not bad at all. The best thing about this sim is that you can log everything that is happening on the car, from tyre surface temperatures to throttle position or steering wheel angle, and analyse it using data acquisition softwares such as Motec. There is a lot to learn from this game. It is not only about driving, it is about setting up the car for a specific track so you can extract the maximum from it. The guys in Reiza have been doing an awesome job.			"

												I have always been a hidden fan of this game, watching reiza's every step. Then I decided to buy this. Game was getting new content, then more new content. Sudenlly of us got a message that Stock Car Extreme will be on steam and now its finally true. When I tryed this game at the first time... well. .. yeah... I fell in love immediately. -    Stunning game out of the box, no moddification needed if you dont want to. Everything is perfectly setup by default.-    FFB perfect. I feel very comfortable with that. I would say the best one to be honest.-    Nice visuals, high resolution textures, very well looking road shaders.-    Few ppl complains about poor adge quality but its easy to solve with forcing AA and other stuff which I dont understand well. There is many many guides on racedepartment.com forum also here on steam is one. -    Full Day/Night cycle-    AI is great, very competitive, sometime I got weird feeling if AI is real person. Agresive and gentle, fighting with you but not in a jerky way-    Cars - V8 stock cars, opala stock car, Formula Reiza (2012), Formula extreme (2014 formula), Minies, Street Camaro SS, Formula V12, Formula Classic, Formula Retro, Formula 3, Formula Vee, a lot of types of karts, MetalMoro M18 (I hope that I have them all =D ) ====== look at pictures on store page-    Many Tracks I will not writing down them here.-    Classic modes practice, single race, championship.-    What more ? I dont know. Its awesome. I spen many hours playing this game, so time on steam is really a nothing. WORTH EVERY PENNY			"

												As someone with tons of hours on the Assetto Corsa clock, I sometimes long for a racing simulation that has the features that separate a circuit racing sim from a mere driving sim. Here is where Stock Car Extreme comes in. The game simulates racing weekends with practice and qualyfying, full flag rules, night racing, standing or rolling starts, tyre and brake temperature, tyre wear, damage, preconfigured pit strategies, championships and decent AI or alternatively the ability to host servers and race online. In other words, it is a feature complete racing sim with the exception of weather simulation. Disclaimer: I have not played the new Steam version of this game that much since it came out only two days ago, but I have driven lots of races on the last version that was distributed directly through the developer. So my basis for this review will be the experiences I had in these last months plus the 2 hours wheel time on the Steam version.In terms of content, it has about a dozen different cars that cover a wide variety of types of vehicle and all behave very differently on track. From karts, Formula 3 racecars, a Camaro streetcar, Minis, the name giving V8 stock cars to F1-alike cars from various decades (list is non-exhaustive) the variety is greater than the number of cars available suggests. The over twenty featured tracks are all made to a very high standard in terms of detail and, according to people who live near them, represent their real counterparts very accurately even though the developer did not employ laser scanning in the modeling process. Most of these tracks are located in Brazil and they include the full tracklist for the 2014 Brazil V8 stock car championship, but a few others are present too, like the Austrian GP track or the now demolished former Johannesburg GP course. Since the game is moddable, there are literally dozens of user-made add-on tracks to download though and almost every major circuit can be found on the net (Head to racedepartment.com or nogripracing if you want to have a starting point).The physics in this game are very predictable and they are conveyed with intuitive Force Feedback. They are not forgiving, but every spin feels deserved and I can always tell what went wrong easily. Physics feel is difficult to describe with words, so I will make a comparison here. Stock Car Extreme combines the firm, defined edge of control I feel in  rFactor 2 with the progressive loss and gain of grip found in Assetto Corsa. The Force Feedback plays an important role in that, because it strikes a  balance between representing the steering feel in a real car and giving the player all the information a real driver would feel through the chassis of the car rather than the steering. You really should play this with a good Force Feedback wheel and pretty much every wheel out there is compatible with the game. Assists like ABS, TC or braking and steering assists are available as well.The AI is decent (i.e. miles ahead of Assetto Corsa or the console games), but not perfect. They are generally able to provide entertaining racing provided the difficulty slider is in the right place (default is 95%, beginners should start lower than that though while pros can go above 105%), but they are often too timid when behind and hesitant to overtaket. On the bright side they crash you out very seldomly. Since most racing sims have terrible AI, this probably still the best AI to be found in a racing sim today (Update: Raceroom has decent AI now, probably on par with this one). The online experience is great once you join a dedicated community with a server, but the public lobby is often empty (that might change with the Steam release though). The netcode behaviour is very good if all players have a decent connection. No warping and smooth movement of the cars. Things will start getting dodgy and warping will occur when pings are over 300, but even then there seems to be some safety net in the collision detection that makes the hit detection very generous when high pings are involved.On the graphics side of things this is clearly a DX9 game, but high quality models and textures along with HDR make the picture pleasing for the eye, miles ahead of last gen console graphics but not quite up there with newer titles like Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. If you want to get a good idea of how the graphics look I would recommend watching some videos on Youtube , or example:

 because racing sims in particular often look differently in motion. The graphics are good enough to make me immersed in the racing and on the flip side the system requirements are moderate even for 60+ fps gaming. One area that often gets overlooked in games is the sounds and Stock Car Extreme gets the job done in this department very nicely. Engine sounds, especially in the V8 stock cars sound amazing in the cockpit and the open cockpit cars have wind sounds as well. Believable sounds for tyre squeal, bottoming out or running over kerbs make the package complete here. Only the exteriour sounds are a bit dull, but the interiour ones makes up for that.If you are looking for a Forza/GT style game on PC, you might want to look at Assetto Corsa instead because of the better graphics and bigger car list even though it lacks some features. Stock Car Extreme is a racing simulation that has all the essential features needed to represent real racing. With the exception of rain, it can simulate everything happening on the track on a real race weekend on top of the actual driving itself. Top notch physics along with some of the best AI in the market (because most competitors have terrible AI) and everything needed to simulate a full racing weekend or even a full championship make this an ideal title for offline racing. It is also a good choice for racing with a community online because of the reliable netcode and the ability for race admins to take race control actions like kicking, moving grid positions etc. Stock Car Extreme is the most well rounded sim racing package on the market today.

												What Reiza has been doing with this engine is amazing. Top notch work, squeezing all the rFactor engine can give, and then adding some spice with custom modifications. Besides the brazilian stock cars, there is a lot of focus on faster Formulas, but you won't be disappointed with the car selection. Reiza has been adding tracks for the faster formulas, but then again you have mods to keep you entertained while waiting for new official goods.Recommended for all, and mandatory to all sim racing fans.

												First of all let me say that i own this game since it came out back in 2013, transferred on Feb. 11th 2015 because it's just easier to keep up to date via Steam. :)Okay that out of the way, where do i start? Well 'Game Stock Car' or 'Stock Car Extreme' as it is now called is a very versatile racing sim, the stock experience of this sim alone is worth the price if you would ask me. - From rental Karts to full on shifter Karts, from old school Formula 1 look alikes to 2014 specification Formula cars, touring cars, Prototypes etc. etc. It pretty much provides everything the petrol head desires. - The highlight of the sim is of course the full license of the Brazilian Stock Car series (Those are basically somewhat technologically advanced touring cars, similar to older DTM cars... with a proper gurgling V8. :P) with all teams, driver names and race tracks. And while most of those tracks are probably lesser known in other parts of the world, pretty much all of them are super fun to drive on and quick to learn.- The A.I itself is capable if maybe a bit passive, but turning up the difficulty and aggression slider definitely improves it a lot. If you get them set up right so that they are maybe a little quicker than you they will provide you with great racing. Alright i could go on forever listing everything that's good with it but well by now you probably know already that i love that game, so here are some negatives as well as some help for drivers new to the simworld/this specific games' engine.- The Engine is quite old and it shows, while it definitely doesn't look terrible while driving, compared to say Assetto Corsa this is a non contest. It runs wonderfully on all sorts of systems though and supports pretty much every resolution you throw at it, it's just not as graphically impressive as other ""newer"" titles in the genre, just throwing this in for those who care much about that.- It's a proper racing sim. Xbox 360 controllers are fairly useless, a wheel preferably with Force Feedback is an absolute recommendation. Especially since this sim has one of the best Force Feedback implementations in the genre. If you can get it dialled right, which leads me to the next point.- A lot of options are in .ini files, for example if your Force Feedback is clipping (meaning the force is going over the wheels threshold and you basically get a really clunky feedback spike instead of a nicely rounded one) you need to go searching for the 'real feel plug in' and add smoothing factors* etc. or if you get motion sick like me from this horrible ""camera shake at high speeds to simulate wind"" nonsense, you have to go dig into the files**(location below) and disable it. But that's about it, once you have it set up to your liking it is an absolute blast. One of the most immersive most complete racing sims out there and with its open modding capabilities you can even add even more content to the game. There are some really good mods out there, Racedepartment for example has a list of over 200 pieces available for free download. Definitely a recommendation from my side. *RealFeelPlugin location '/steamlibrary/steamapps/common/Stock Car Extreme' -> RealFeelPlugin.iniSearch for this command line ""DefaultSmoothingLevel="" and test out what level of smoothing suits your configuration best.**disable headshake at high speeds go to: '/steamlibrary/steamapps/common/Stock Car Extreme/UserData/YourProfileName' -> open the ""YourProfileName"".PLR with notepad and search for ""Cockpit Vibration"" set all four command lines to ""0"" and you are good to go. While you are in the User PLR you can also enable the virtual mirror while in cockpit by searching for:""Virtual Rearview In Cockpit"" and setting it to 1, as well as searching for ""Rearview"" and setting it to either ""1,2 or 3"" to determine what type of virtual mirror you would like to have displayed. Anyway that's it from me i hope this ""review"" helped you to determine whether you like to buy it, have fun! :)- Paz			"

												First, before you read this, go buy either the reiza bundle or game stockcar extreme, and start installing it while you read this, you'll thank me.At first sight, the title might not seems so appealing, if you are like me and nascar ain't your thing, then likely, like me, you have never checked really what was game stockcar.I've been driving in rF2 since 2012, and I had heard game stockcar mentioned a few times.  And often, people were talking about it with convictions.   I had enough with rF2 and then AC came out, spent some time with it, realized it wasn't really my cup of tea, so I'm back to rF2.  The gMotor engine sims are just the best.It is only recently that I realized that game stockcar extreme is actually brazil's stockcar, which are more like touring cars than nascars.  So I bought the bundle.  And boy... I should have gotten this long before.  You have to know that game stockcar is using an heavily modded rFactor 1 engine.  And pushes it so far, that you'd almost think they are using the rFactor 2 engine.  For a long time, I believed ISI/Simbin were the best at making tracks, regarding accuracy, details, texturing, blending,  repetitions, etc.. they are certainly above Kunos... and I'm not talking about how they look in game, AC have a better graphic engine.  But after trying out GSCE, it's clear that Reiza is at the top.  I have yet to try out all tracks, but so far, might have tried 7-8, and they all look fantastic.  Tarmac textures are the best I've ever seen.  And this goes for pretty much everything.The tracks themselves are super nice.  I would move to Brazil any day to be able to race these tracks as much as I would like to.  I'm a huge nordschleife fan, and I've raced this track for 3 years straight, and the tracks in there are very nice.  Why did I mentioned the nordschleife, not because GSCE have such a track, but I mean, the nordschleife is a nice flowing tracks, and most of those in GSCE are like this.  Very few tracks with tight hairpins, and lots of tracks with nice fast bends, plenty of challenging S, and all kind of long curves.  The track surface (road definition) is probably the best I've seen as well.  The tracks feels very alive.The AI is what you would expect from a gmotor engine based game, excellent.  I have to train quite a bit on a given track in order to beat the AI at the default 95%.  They are certainly very challenging.FFB is awesome, and it's hard to say which I like best between rFactor 2 and GSCE.  That's much to say, since it's using an older engine.If you buy the bundle and get the formula truck, then you can race racing semis on the same track selections.If you like real simulators, then you are missing on much if you are passing on this.

												Reiza Studios is for me now the best Studio making this type of Simulator, after a little bit of crowd funding they continue to support improve and develope this title and the Next title "" Auotmobilista "" wich will be a step forward in GFX and us owners of SCE get it free ( purchased before Jan ) . And going but screen shots is massive improvment in looks on SCE.So do i recommend SCE..100% helllllsssss yes!!!.  does it look like Project cars? No  But as a Realistic Sim with Real and based on Real cars and championships it will keep you driving for many hours. Basicly SCE is a very cleaned up game on ISI rFactor engine, so its very user friendly, very modable, and based contant alone with Brazilian Stock cars , Mini cup, Lancer Cup, Karts , Super Karts , F1 cars from 70s, 80s, 90s , 00, 10s fictional of course but awsome to drive and my Fav Super V8s based on Aussie V8 Supercars and so many more. They have found a way to take the engine to its limit, physics, Gfx , lighting. So in all seriousness this title should be in EVERY race fans account. and keep an Eye on Reiza, as a small company they are showing the big boys how to do it right.So read other reviews its really easy to setup, play mod to suit what you want no BS.

												I've been enjoying this game since 2012, long before the Steam re-release, and it ranks as one of my all-time favourite racing sims. It's a little known gem that deserves greater exposure than it has achieved to date.Being based on a modified and evolved version of the rFactor engine gives Stock Car Extreme a great platform to build on and Reiza have done just that. For what it lacks in visual polish, Stock Car Extreme more than makes up for it on the track with cars that feel convincingly realistic. This is a title that really needs to be driven with a racing wheel to get the best experience, with force feedback that conveys the physics so well.Car and track content is fresh, varied and eclectic with a South American focus (Reiza is a Brazilian developer) therefore offering something a little different from other race sims. The car selection ranges from the V8 touring cars that lend the title it's name to the Mini Challenge series to karts, a prototype, a Camaro and a selection of open wheel cars past and present. Tracks are equally varied with locations from around the world and historic layouts plus a couple of good street circuits.In summary: Stock Car Extreme is a must-have title for racing simulation fans.

												While new generation simracing softwares are promising, this is the one !Not for the usual gamer though. Requires a lot of skill and practice. You can only taste it fully with a good wheel-and-pedals set.- Great physics, focused on realism;- Awsome engine sounds;- Graphics good enough, with attention to cars/tracks models details and fidelity;- Big variety, from rental karts to lots of different F-One eras. - The best wheel force feedback of them all.- The best you can get from Artificial-Inteligence Opponents.- Even better through leagues online. You may stumble on most of the real Brazilian Stock Car real drivers (if you can be fast enough not to eat their dust).A must for every simracer out there.			"

												Disclaimer: I have owned the game for some months, so my total hours are not showing up.Stock Car Extreme is a marvelous racing sim. It's made by a small studio who actually listens to the user's feedback, and it contains a lot of unusual cars and tracks since it's based on a Brazilian racing series.SCE is based on the old rFactor technology, but the dev team is still pushing the engine to its limits by adding new features with each free update.It plays nicely with gamepads, even though, as always, nothing can beat a FFB wheel. The graphics are actually nice, because the official content is very, very well made. Mod tracks often don't look as good, but if you get your mods from places like RaceDepartment their quality is generally stellar.Get it! Once you try the open wheelers' ridiculous sense of speed you won't be able to go back to other sims.			"

												Car games nowadays are about graphics graphics graphics. But sadly I found most of the time, they don't make me feel I'm driving it as fast as the speedometer shows. I can ""fly"" a top Formula series in 300 km/h in-game, but it doesn't make me feel as ""nervous"" as I'm in a family wagon in 100 km/h. That's what I think they missed a lot, the immersion. But with this piece, in an old-school graphics, it did it. I don't know what magic spell did Reiza cast, but they made it, and they made it beautifully. Playing a Vee or Kart is as fun as the Extreme level now.			"

												If you take your racing games seriously and have a steering wheel then this game is a must. I've already clocked in over 100 hours before getting this on steam and it's by far one of the best racing sims I've played. If you are planning on using a control pad then you'll be missing out on what makes this game special. It also has great support from Reiza studio who have been adding free content for the past year. I would easily pay £40 for this game.			"

												This is far more than a Mod of rF1. It would be a massive mistake to consider this just another rf1 game. This is an incredible reworking of the rF1 engine pushed to extreme limits. GSCx is graphically inferior to modern race sims like Assetto Corsa or Project cars but what makes GSCx shine are the physics and tire models of some unique cars. One of my favorite sim racing titles and still in continued development.			"

												This is PC sim racing at its best. Praise the lord that is has finally been released on Steam so, hopefuly, wider audience may experience this brilliant game.It is not your average racing game, Reiza Studio has reached a point where you could experience how it might be behind a wheel of these cars. Force Feedback is so good that only sitting in a real car could be better and slightly outdated graphics don't matter at all when you start driving and experiencing the track through the wheel. Yes, the wheel. Sadly this game has to be experienced with a decent wheel with proper force feedback, otherwise you might be slightly disappointed with it.Some people might be disappointed by fairly limited choice of cars/tracks ""out of the box"" but all you need to do, is to go to RaceDepartment.com and the whole new world of mods will open to you.The sheer pleasure of driving that this game gives is just incredible and it is definately worth playing.Pros:- The best FFB ever!!!- Demanding (real) physics.- South American tracks- Modding (incredible library of quality mods).Cons:- Graphics (doesn't matter tbh)- Not too many cars ""out of the box""- Almost only South American Tracks ""out of the box""			"

												Having raced this simulator for months (since before the steam release), I can say with certainty it's one of the best, and constantly evolving, simulators currently in the market.  Here's a few bullet points:- Varied racing categories, from small compact cars to beefy V8s and several generations of F1, and even multiple kart categories- Car handling is realistic (this is, first and foremost, a simulator), while also being great fun. It's not uncommon to want to go ""one more lap"", and completely lose track of time. Mind you, I'm playing on a Thrustmaster T500RS steering wheel and pedal set, which gets me great force feedback.- Tracks are also plentiful, varied and well-made, plus it's not hard to find extra content (both tracks and vehicles) online. The out-of-the-box tracks are hard to beat for their quality, tho.- The graphics are functional and performance is great. While the game cannot compete on eye-candy with games based on newer engines, it's still being polished and upgraded (in fact, a graphical shader update is just around the corner).- While we're talking about updates, the team making the game is one of the most dedicated dev teams in activity, always listening to fan feedback and constantly adding more and more (and free!) content to the game.So, yea, great game, great dev team, great price. Highly recommended!			"

So many reasons to love it, but to just sum up; the glorious sensation of driving an accurately modeled race car on the edge of control with realistic physics. There's truly something for everybody here, from F1 cars to rental karts. And oh, those fantastic Formula Vees. The Formula Vee ALONE is enough to warrant the purchase of the sim. So much fun. And as if the huge amount of base content wasn't enough, the amount of free quality mods available is just staggering. Don't see your favorite track in the game yet? Chances are there's a great version of it available as a free mod. (And then you can drive that awesome Vee on it!) Work up a sweat, you will, racing the fantastic AI. Man, I love this sim so much.

												This is one of my favorite sims. The physics leave little to be desired, the AI is fantastic, and the force feedback is the second best I have tried.  Niels is a genius.. I play almost every sim on the market, but I was late to the party with this one, and i gotta say, I was missing a lot. The Reiza content is fantastic, and it also has a great mod community, with the best mods from RFactor available (only updated and upgraded), and original mod content as well.  The physics and force feedback aren't quite at RFactor 2's level, but the content is  possibly superior in range of vehicles you get. Nothing matches the best cars in RF2, but it also doesn't have any below average content, and every single car is worthy of your time. That said, after discovering RFACTOR 2, I have been spending a lot less time here. My only complaint is that the online community is lacking, but the fault lies on us consumers and not the game itself. If you haven't tried it yet, do it. Do IT! As soon as possible, do it! If you are into sim racing, I would say this is a must have title. Forget the other big names coming out right now, as they may be prettier, but none of them will give you the complete package  and amazing wheel to wheel racing experience that this does.  If I had to name one downside to this game, it would be the UI, as it can be a little confusing at first, and isn't as polished as some of the competition.  . But that is a small price to pay for the second best sim on the market. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that Reiza is always updating, and releasing FREE new content to people who own it. There isn't a better value for your money out there. See you on the track!			"

												I owned this game quite a while before it came out on steam, so please do not be distraught by the low amount of hours played, I probably put a hundred into it already :PWhy do I reccommend this game? Because it's a no-frills-attached racing sim dealing with some obscure cars and tracks, including the Brazilian Stock Car series (which is much closer to the Aussi V8 Supercar series then, say, NASCAR - No oval racing here), very good AI and the best track design you will find in a sim (even though 3/4th of the Sim's track line-up are tracks you have never heard from). Aside from that, Reiza studios (a team of rFactor modders who banded together to create their own title) often updates their products for free! The amount of content in this sim has doubled with no addittional cost. As such, it has the best post-release support for any game.It also features gems like:1) An 'oval' track where people turn right!2) Just about any F1 car you can think off!3) A formula car you simply can't think off (powered by a VW beetle engine)!4) All the obscure Brazilian tracks!5) Excellent mod support!6) Brazilians!7) An 11hp rental kart!8) And much more!

												My verdict: Most engaging Racing Sim I've played  If you have a wheel or itching for a reason to buy one, get this sim. You'll have fun. Its not about stock cars: there's about 20 other types!! For multiplayer experiences, I can't really comment just yet as that has many other qualities to consider beyond the sim itself. So how does this sim stack up by itself?First, this sim's force feed back is very good (logitech G920 here) and a real factor into contributing to this being the most immersive experience of any sim I've played: you'll be sweating and busy as you'd be in a real race car. It's not a casual affair. Also if I compare this sim to Dirt Rally, Assetto Corsa, rFactor2, ... this one stands out in that it makes me smile (bit more on that later). With the physics, everything seems to makes sense.. sliding off on dirtier parts of the track, lift off leading to spins.. bit by bit I found myself learning, adjusting and driving faster. It was a challenge to drive consistenly fast and crash free for 20-30 minutes, and so the feel of achievement is just great when crossing the finish line. Luckily this is not because the game is harsh or anything. That all combined with the competent AI is I think why overall experience of racing in this sim is so good.. and FUN really. I can't help but feel that a certain thing of Brazil is showing through .. a certain something that others just lack...AI - Good and certainly the most enjoyable I've experienced. The AI is cheecky and may nudge you, it jumps in gaps, it respects racing lines decently but also doesn't drone around in one long line up. Overtaking is very rewarding.Graphics - Less than for example Asseto Corsa but easily good enough to not break the spell. My GTX970 runs 3440x1440@60Hz pretty smoothly (Maxxed but 14 cars, x2 AA, shadows high, 4xAni).Sound - Great. Just watch/listen to the videos! Works in 'hearing' the distance to others.Realism - Not a race driver, but weight transfer, weight, tweaks, grip all seem to be realistic.Gameplay - Great fun. Find a car and track(s) that gels with you, tweak the AI to be a good challenge and start a 15 minute race. The rolling start works well. Default setups are very workable.Content - Most complete sim out of the box. Plus many community tracks / mods if you're looking for a track you may want that is not in the game. Wide range of cars and car types, many South American tracks and tracks you won't find in other sims.GUI - Slightly confusing at start, not perfect but easy to get around once you get used to it.**9.8/10** Highly Recommended for anyone that is not looking for an arcade 'sims'. Great value.			"

												Without a doubt the best racing game based on the already outdated rFactor engine.Is it better than Assetto Corsa? I don't think so, but it can compete with it easily. The old engine simply cannot provide as detailed physics as the new upcoming sims, but it does the job - everything is there. There is no exaggerated oversteer that will make you struggle through corners, the grip levels feel just as they should, tires perform depending on their temperatures and wear, brakes too, the AI is nothing too special, but they are very raceable and challenging, even graphics-wise it manages to push out that last bit of juice out of that old technology.As far as content goes, there's plenty, even though it could use a touring or GT class in there, it doesn't really matter. This game proves that every class is fun and playable if the physics are good enough.However, F1 and open wheeler fans in general should really have this game. There are FIVE (5) F1-like classes from different seasons and eras, plus the F3 and Formula Vee.All in all, it's a really good all-round sim and it's not too expensive.			"

												One of the best racing sims I have played. Gives you a great amount of cars and feels pretty much on par with iRacing but for well more than half the total price of getting a car or two with a track or two. Also no grip racing as a good amount of add on tracks for it. If you are into Track/Road Racing you NEED THIS SIM.			"

I have several racing sim's, iRacing, Assetto Corsa, RaceRoom, and this one and really I think this GSC-E is better then the others at least right now it is. And, you can get a lot of Mod's if you want to add car's or Tracks to the sim. Just my 5cents on this sim.			"

												This is possibly one of the greatest racing sims ever made. I mean, this is on an old engine ( the one that made rFactor and GT-R 2) and to be honest, I can't really tell. It feels great thanks to the RealFeel plugin from rFactor. Looks amazing knowing the engine thats ancient. Has so much content ( Currently in love with Formula V12 and Johanesburg ) The only downside is sometimes the AI is a little wonky, and sometimes too aggressive even at 30%. Overall 9/10 would reccomend to anybody who loves sim-racing.			"

												After a lengthy wait on steam, I can finally say that this game delivers in every aspect. It exceeds expectations on the old rFactor engine, adding graphical and physical improvements. The primary focus of this game is catered towards the Brazilian V8 Stock Car Series, hence ""Stock Car"" Extreme. However, there is a pluthera of series, from classic formula one cars, to Mini Coopers. Personally, one of my favorites are the go-karts. Honestly, If you want the ultimate experience, this is the best bang-for-the-buck simulator.			"

If not, just buy it. You won't regret!Reiza has done an AMAZING job with this game.

												Is this game for you? Do you like how a racing game feels? If yes then yes! 100% Don't let its title fool you either, there are all sorts of cars not just ""stock"" cars.I CHALLENGE you to try the game and go to the slowest vehicle in the game. Turn off all the driving help/aids. Change vehicles by using the mouse on the left or right arrows on the main screen and Get into the direct drive (one gear only!) kart Kantan Kart 125cc and drive the great real Granja Viana track. Initially in the pits I didn't like the FFB, but put up with it until you hit the track. THEN experience learning how to steer with the wheel AND both your feet! Learn how to steer with your BRAKE and your THROTTLE!The feeling in this game is EXCELLENT! The sounds are really good as well. Listen to the Aussie SuperV8s, sweet.So again if you like the way a racing game FEELS you must give this a try. I believe you will be happy with your decision.Never heard of most of the tracks? Neither had I, almost all are good to drive. Anyway besides as others have eluded to, if this isn't enough there are heaps of excellent additional 3rd party tracks and cars based on rFactor (like the game itself).			"

												Worth every penny. I've tried quite a few of the current racing sims but this is the one I play most often and have the most fun with. I'm only loosely a real race driver (24 Hours of Lemons). I do spend quite a bit of time just lapping most the tracks and trying out new cars. I can't say I'm very fast but with this game I'm having a ball. The best part is I don't need a massively expensive setup to make this sim work. It runs great on my i5 and a used G27 I picked up from Amazon. With Project Cars and Assetto Corsa, my machine struggles to keep up with the amount of graphics. As much as I like the super realistic scenery, I really just don't need to see super detailed puddles and trees to have a great time or get a feel for how a car feels on a track. And who really needs to see that stuff in a sim anyways? When I race my concentration is on the car, the line and the next corner (and maybe a flag stand since I used to be a corner worker). But I'm not particulary paying attention to a puddle that I'm screaming by at 80 mph plus (so it doesn't need to be in 1080p if you get my drift).Loads of fun. Great price. And a great opportunity to buy into Reizas next sim.			"

												A sim racing game about a race series that I never heard of. How well does this game turns out? It's fantastic.As I said before, I never heard of the Stock Car Extreme (SCE), let alone the Brazilian Stock Car series. But don't let the title fool you - this game gives a plethora of race cars to choose from. I found this game through a sim racing youtuber, which praised this game quite a lot. I'm curious and decided to give it a go, and how! What a wonderful racing simulation game it is. Prior to this, I have only played old - but trusted - sim racing games such as GTR 2, rFactor (old one), Richard Burns Rally, and Race series from Simbin. I can say that this game belongs up there with the sim racing greats. Granted, I never really played any of the more modern sim racing titles such as iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, or Project CARS, but I'm going to get there someday - and this game is the start. Hopefully they wouldn't disappoint me with their much higher price tag!What I can say from this game is it feels really immersive, at least with the cars I've tried. I currently only have driven the stock cars and several of the formula cars. My trustworthy Logitech Momo Racing still gives a very good force feedback, the sound of the cars are impressive, and the handling of the cars are very good - it's not overly hard to drive, but it is much harder to go fast. It's a bit forgiving, actually, but it's still a heck load of fun. The only down side is probably the graphics - it's definitely not as impressive as the previously stated titles, but I don't really care about the graphics anyway. I'm here for the handling physics, the racing - not for how beautiful the game looks. It's probably just me being biased for not having an impressive computer set up, though.Overall, this game is a blast - it's my first game here in Steam, and this game also introduced me to the online sim racing community in my country. Absolutely, positively, a highly recommended game for sim racers out there. Whether you just want to try out how it is to be a sim racer, or for the old time sim racer - this game is for you! I can't give it a higher score for what it did with the price. Thumbs up!			"

												My experience with race sims started with Race 07, about 1~2 years ago. At some time last year I got a cheap wheel that incresead my pleasure playing Race 07, and started to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 too. At this moment, I enjoyed this kind of game, but nothing so special.Things began to change when I got the Assetto Corsa in late 2014, and soon after when I bought a Logitech G27 steering wheel at the beginning of January. At that point, I started to really enjoy racing simulation games. How curious that I am, I started researching more about it in forums and sites related to this type of game, and youtube videos channels too, then I met the Game Stock Car, which always had great impressions, seemed like a good sim.Then I saw that the game Stock Car Extreme was to be released via Steam, and got the game so that was released. And since then, my experience and fun with this kind of game has been excellent. I'm not that experienced as a pilot, but the game has helped me a lot to improve, this is very positive for me.Things I think are very good in Stock Car Extreme:- It does not require many resources, works very well here with a Core 2 Duo 2.67GHz 4GB RAM and a GTX550Ti, all settings maxed running at 1920x1080.- Very good feeling of force feedback and physics. Although not an experienced driver, in this game I can feel a good feedback on the track and the car, I can feel how much more can I speed up and when to relieve the pedals. This has helped me a lot to get better.- The AI, for offline racing, excelent! As I play offline often trying to improve my skills, that's great! This is the best AI that I found (and a lot of reviews about this game confirm).- A wide variety of tracks and cars, including karts and historical categories of Formula 1.- Availability of many mods of tracks and cars, as the game is based on rfactor engine.Based on my researchs and self experience and other reviews, I think this is the best offline car racing simulator at this moment. It's a great sim.The only negative at this moment is about multiplayer, few servers and little people online, but this tends to improve with the launch on Steam, at least that's what I hope :)Thanks Reiza for this awesome sim!

												This racing sim, for the money, has more features, cars and tracks than I expected. The sensation of sheer speed is enough to give me goose bumps. Excellent, excellent sim that should cost much more. Very configurable. Very stable...Runs flawlessly @ 1920x1080 with framerates above 100fps on my GTX-970 with no, that's NO issues whatsoever. Racing sounds are all around you that are realistic and the adrenaline rush as the rpm's rise cannot be described, only experienced. It brings to mind the exclamation, ""What a rush!"" And I am in no way connected to these Devs...I'm just calling it as I see it and giving credit where credit is due. If I were to think of a ""con"", it would have to be the opening screen when you choose what vehicle class/race you want...the indicator to make a choice is not intuitive for me (and some others who have posted in the forums. Premium game for the price and I think the Devs could have charged so much more money for the sheer thrill it gives me. I applaud their hard work and attention to detail.			"

												While it does not have cutting-edge graphics, it focuses heavily on the simulation part. The AI adapt well (although they still have the occasional hiccup, but no coding is ever perfect...) to most situaitons you toss at them. While they tend to freight train easily that's really my only complaint in terms of how they perform. They make mistakes about as often as the actual professionals in most cases as well, so you've got that.If you have a good-but-not-cutting-edge-computer, then this is a solid choice. Plus, there are plenty of mods for tracks and additional classes of cars, so really there is no limit.However, consider buying Automoblista instead of this (unless you're on a budget), as the latter is better in many ways and also the most up-to-date version Rezia is focusing on.8/10			"

												Game Stock Car Extreme is ISI Rfactor 1 engine, perfected. It runs well across a variety of systems. It has great physics and difficulty scaling. A lot of base content and a large mod community. It looks decent, if not great at times. Plus it's the only 'mainstream' game with all of these south american tracks that are just joys to experience and race on. If you're not Brazilian or from Central/South America, you're in for some lovely track layouts you've probably never heard of before. Which adds a new challenge, not having a bunch of familiar racing tracks. (It also has Modern and Historic Montreal! Canada Pride! Gilles et Jacques génial grand prix pilotes! Lance Stroll bientôt eh...peut-être?)Best with a wheel. More than playable with a controller. Might take a bit of trial and error to set up either, it's still ISI Rfactor 1 engine after all.

												Seems like everything Reiza touches turns gold. After so long on the market the title shouldn't need any kind of recommendation - but if you still aren't sure if you should get the best simracing game, then let me tell you: yes, you definitely should!There's plenty of default content from tiny karts to giant (in comparison) V8 stocks. But if it's not enough, there's big amount of add-on mods. It is fully moddable (sounds, cams, cars, tracks, skins, user interface, music) - you can change/add/replace pretty much all you need.New content keeps coming - from both Reiza and 3rd party modders. SCE is a very juicy sim-fruit.			"

												Finally figured out that the background art in the main menu is what selects the car class. Hit the little arrow on the side until it says ""all cars / all tracks"" and then play whatever you like.I immediately hopped into a Formula Vee and was impressed at the driving experience. You *must* heel-toe downshift or else the clutch will drag and you spin. You *must* be progressive on the brakes or the wheels lock and you spin. I never thought I could have so much fun driving a sim (this is my first ""real"" driving sim). The sounds and graphics aren't nearly so old as people make them out to be.I'm playing with a Track IR 5 and Logitech G25 at 3440x1440 ultrawide and absolutely loving it. The next update will enhance the graphics shaders and add some new content as well. The community is super friendly and the devs are very helpful.If you want to drive the latest unobtainable Ferrari via chase cam at the Nurburgring, look elsewhere. If you want to experience high fidelity sim driving, this is the absolute best bang for your buck.Video review (includes mod support discussion and future release info):

												I got my wheel. I tried multiple games..  Gas Guzzlers Extreme was very fun, but this... this is a sim, and the guys who made it and are improving it, are serious. I absolutely love it. The sound as I'm speeding up and shifting gears is perfect. The hit at the end of the runway as I slammed into the divider was perfect. Oh and did I tell you that I went over it? Yes, quite ^^. This is the first game I remember playing that allows that. I also went ahead and burned my engine ^^. Most fun I've had in a racing game today, and I tried a bunch (only to find out that now that I'm off the keyboard, I suck at driving anything anywhere). This game allowed me to just drive around and enjoy the process, which is what I wanted to do, testing out the wheel. Support the developers. This title comes highly recommended from me.

												The best racing sim on Steam. In-depth physics and wonderful force-feedback make it a joy to play. A week after I got it, I couldn't play Gran Turismo 6 again and iRacing started to feel a little weird because the FFB in Stock Car Extreme is that much better. The default content is top notch across the board, so the sea of mods that come easily converted from rFactor aren't even necessary. Sure, the graphics are outdated and the tracks aren't laser scanned, but you won't notice that while playing. It's that good.			"

												Possibly one of the best sim racing games on the market. Altough the game engine might be a bit outdated, the physics are amazing and so is the FFB. The AI is one of the best I've ever seen and it is actually fun to play offline races with the AI, as they will be competetive and you can have some really good battles with them, unlike other games where they would back off or just leave tons of space once you're next to them. If you don't have a decent steering wheel, don't buy it. It isn't a game for keyboard or gamepads.			"

												Great game, WITHOUT MUCH PROMOTIONS, unlike AC and project cars, definitely needs more attention!Has no addiction elements unlike Codemasters, there is no money, no arcade points and careerBut there TIRE WEAR, TIER TEMPS WHICH LOOK REALISTIC, FUEL consumption and perhaps only driving addictive here,Nice menu, a step forward from both rFactors in my opinion, because I like how showroom is used here to select vehicle livery.Great game, even when I played it on Keyboard, cornering felt to me like no other game, it's very dynamic, and if you do wrong thing at any point when passing corner(if you apply too much throttle or steer too much, or steer not smoothly), you can see how easily you can crash or get off track.Graphics is nice to me.Also I downloaded Lite edition some time ago which works for 30 days which is a lot to me, which is great, it has not much cars but still stock cars, formula reiza, carts are present, so fun for hours.Also If you want to race lan, it should be nice for some serious sim racing competition between friends. (Sadly I don't have such). Maybe require Internet connection if you want to play lan - which is not very cool in some cases.Basically it's a rFactor 1 + top quality content(very consistent, graphics, game menu and physics make this game look like game completely different from rFactor 1)Focuses on brazil stock cars			"

												Quality simulator experience. Leagues ahead of others like Assetto Corsa and PCars. It may be based on the rFactor 1 engine from around 10 years ago but graphics improvements and physics changes help make it look clean and fresh. Maybe not up to the likes of the latest games but it does have the advantage that it runs well at full graphics on lower systems. Not one for controller/keyboard users, wheel only, definitely recommend. (Played many hours before Steam addon) "

												""Game Stock Car Extreme"" is said to be a ""Hardcore Sim"". But, Hardcore does not mean hard to drive in this game.All cars' physics are very well developed, balanced and accessible. And it's very ""nice and fun to drive"".Also, various ""Driving Assists"" (Steeing Help, Braking Help, Stability Control, ABS, TC etc.) are available in this game. And by changing those settings, we can play this game both as a ""Hardcore Sim for experienced Sim Racers"" and also as a ""Sim for Beginners"" to get started.Of course, we can play this game well both with a Steering Wheel Controller and with a Gamepad.The graphics look not so special. But the core features of this game (car physics, sounds, AI, car models, tracks etc.) are solidly made, and offer a worthwhile Racing Experience.I recommend this title to everyone who is interested in Sim Racing.

												Just picked this game up over the weekend and put roughly 7 hours into it. I've read other reviews prior to purchasing which state how underrated this game is, and I have to wholeheartedly agree! I like the fact you can choose all the different disciplines, e.g. V8 stock, Formula, mini's, karts etc, but my favs are the Formula and V8 stock cars. The user interface is also pretty intuitive.The tracks are challenging and varied, the cars look great, sound great and are challenging with no hint of arcadiness. I am a big R3E fan and while there are some minor nuances in the handling between the two, its easy to make the transition back and forth physics wise. Which in actuality both are very simliar, the FFB is much more streamlined (simpler) in GSCE. In short a big thumbs up to Reiza. If you haven't already picked up GSCE, I highly recommend it!			"

												I'vr played this game for  hundreds of hours but just recently bought a Steam key for it.  This is hands down one of the best driving simulations on Steam.  It's moddable, easy to play, and has great cars and series that come with the sim.  The controls, handling, design, and artwork are fantastic. The force feedback is spot on and Reiza is one of the best developers in the business.  They have never charged for DLC for this game and have given several cars and tracks free as part of updates.   Short of not being able to create custom championships, there's not much missing nor are there many bugs.  This is the game that Assetto Corsa and Project Cars wish they could grow up to be.  The AI is the best on Steam and the single player portions of the game are fun and very time consuming.  I normally play with a Logitech DFGT, but before I bought it, I played this game forever with an XBOX Controller.  It works just as well as the wheel.  This is well worth a purchase.  As a matter of fact, buy this game now and leave Project Cars and Assetto Corsa on your wishlist for a whlie longer.  If you tire of the in game content, there's a downloadable mod or track for just about any series or track thats out there.  An amazing experience.			"

Good, challenging AI, good ffb, good sounds, good physics, good multiplayer, decent championships, great amount of features - rules, pitstops, night racing, time progression - only obvious thing that is missing is rain. Also, the developer still plans to add many more cars, tracks and features for free. Graphics are only decent, but that can be plus with someone with old pc. Great collection of unknown tracks and cars - you will definetly find combos here you haven't driven in any other sim or racing game.			"

												I haven't put many hours into the steam version, but this is THE BEST Dev I have ever purchased any game from. These are the most dedicated and interactive developement team that truly cares about their productAND their customer. This team deserves much more success than they have and if more people who enjoy REAL sim racing bought from them, the big guys would be out of business. This is the kind of people who deserve support from the sim community and anyone else who is tired of buying crap and being told ""it will get fixed in upcoming updates..."" (looking at you SMS) and the updates dont come but DLC that you have to buy does. This game has been updated, fixed,and received new content ALL for free. And it is possibly the best racing game today, maybe not as pretty as some of the newer stuff, but way better physics and realism than any other that I have played recently. Hope this convinces more people to purchase REIZA products now and hopefully the future if they can stay out of  the red and continue their awesome work.			"

It doesn't have the solid multiplayer of iRacing, the pretty graphics of Assetto Corsa and the UI can be a little confusing at times, but what it does have is lots of intensive single player racing against AI and a great car selection where every car feels completely different and unique. The game also managed to convey the feeling of driving a car at it's limits like no other racing sim I have played. This game is however not exactly a plug&play experience, finding the right car, setup and input configuration can take a while, but it's worth the effort.			"

AI is excellent, way better than in AC where they will actively try to kill you and run off the track. It's not much of a game though, the fun is in the driving itself so there isn't a proper career mode etc, just bear that in mind.			"

												This is really great.  Got to be one of the most underrated race sims around in my opinion.These Brazilian tracks are really nice and fun and there are tons more well made track  mods around too.Setup was super easy for me, with FFB spot on without me having to change anything. ( I'm looking at you Project Cars).I did feel the need to change the cockpit movement, I didn't like the view learning but its easy to turn that off.Ai is good, fast and fun to race with and the physics feel just right.The sound is superb, probably the best I'v heard in a race sim.It all adds up to a good feeling of immersion that I just don't get with some other newer sims.And of course the superV8cars, Australian V8Supercars which with some mods can have Fords as well as the Holdens the cars are based on. Hopefully/probably later we'll have lots more Aussie tracks and skin packs, as well as a full OZ V8 mod sooner or later..There are some Cons,, Its looks a bit oldish. Not rubbish, just oldish. Doesn't look bad at all but its no Project cars in the looks department. Though this is a Pro too as it runs great on old hardwareThere is day, night and transition but I didn't find anywhere about weather and rain.This sim has come along way since Game Stock Car 2013 with all the updates.If you are after a race Sim rather than a driving sim or a racing ""game"", then this is well worth  looking into..

												I'm struggling to like this game. I admire what Reiza attempted, the core is quite solid and it's nice change to play with cars/tracks that aren't in every other sim out there. But something about this game doesn't makes it work for me, also, the engine/visuals are very dated, which for me is not cutting it anymore. It's not that it's ugly, but in todays racing sims/games it is the worse looking one. FFB by default on my wheel ( Fanatec CSW2) is completely broken ( inverted) so I have to find a time to fix that It's not badly priced, but even so I think I would not recommend this over it's competitors. Old gmotor games such as GTR2, GT legends are usually available for $5-10, don't see a reason why to spent 3 times that for something that feels very similar to those.			"

It is a MUST in this game/simulator.The game is not joypad friendly at all (wireless xbox360 in my case), i tried to play for about 30 minutes going into the joypad settings with no luck, the sensitivity was horrible, no matter what i did, i couldnt get it to feel right. I think the developing team should consider making a joypad profile in the setting option in order to make it more playable for some people.Got a full refund for the game, that was my frist refund request and hopefully the last.

												I'll rewrite my review since some of you are so booty hurt. If you think, simulators can't translate into gamepads, than, I guess you're naive. It's still quite boring. The graphics aren't all that special and the calibration is clearly set, more accurately, for steering wheels. Regardless, I don't see a recommendation warning: Don't buy without steering wheel!!  There's other racers out there, well worth the extra dollar.			"

My only excuse is writng it at an unearthly hour of the morning and being full of morphine, so I sometimes tend to miss things. With respect to some of your comments, there's never any need to become personal (i.e  the comment from Hex, who has obviously not read any of my other reviews - all 80 plus - no one can get everything right.

												As soon as you hit 160-180km/h in either the Formula Reiza or Formula V12, the car just refuses to turn unless you max out the steering lock, and even then you're not guaranteed that the car will turn. It's extremely disheartening to see your opponents breeze past on the outside while you're struggling to get the damned thing to turn in.I'm using a gamepad rather than a wheel, BTW, and a crappy laptop with integrated graphics. Maybe if I had a half-decent gaming PC the game would be less of a ♥♥♥♥ to me.EDIT: I've since decreased speed sensitivity from 100% (default) to 50%. I've seen 0% recommended, but the car felt really twitchy, and when I'm struggling to get 30FPS on the lowest graphics settings, I don't need that unpredictability.			"

												Simply one of the best racing sims you can buy and it doesn't require a second mortgage to build a rig that is capable of running it. Plays like a much refined version of rFactor, with the fun of Race 07.I've just ported my original Reiza version to Steam and I was running within minutes. Just copy the files you need and the whole effort is painless. Remember to make backups though.EDIT: Reiza has added a lot of extra content to GSC2013, evolving to Extreme, without charging anything extra to those original buyers. They even gave us original owners Steam keys, which I really appreciate. Add the free Copa das Marcas and you have to realize that Reiza is not your average DLC pushing money grabbing corporate developer/publisher. Way to go Reiza, keep up the good work!!!RESPECT!			"

												I've put close to 100 hours into the Non-Steam version of the game, the one that's available for direct download from Reiza's website. However I decided to get the Steam key for the game in order to get smoother game updates and avoid hassling with activation keys when changing hardware or OS.It's not the prettiest sim game around but the driving physics is one of the most convincing on the market, together with rFactor, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom ... which is no surprise since they are all based on the ISI engine. You also get a tonne of content in this game, including Reiza's own version of Formula One.The game supports gamepads as well as wheels, you can map every button on either. You can even play with your keyboard. The game has an extensive range of Assists- and Difficulty settings, so anyone can enjoy this game. One of the most unique things about this game is that you'll experience a large selection tracks that you simply won't find in any other sim game, unless it's another Reiza game that is. With its technical sophistication and abundance of gameplay,  you are getting a real bargain.			"
