												This is a amazing game which I bought for only $0.89.I enjoyed this game totally and spend 35 hours on this game to play it to completion.What is really great about this game is the storyline.The story is not only very interesting, it also have a lot of very surprising twist and turn.When I get to the end I found that everything in the game world is not as it seems.Furthermore, I had a very warm feeling when I finish the game.I have a new understanding of what God and Demon means (in this particular game world).There is also themes romance, sacrifice, prejudice etc that makes the game a lot deeper than what it appears initially.I also love the way the game progress from beginning to end.It unfolds like a mystery novel, and I can also play several flashback of past events which helps me understand the story. Some of the flashbacks contains surprising revelations that totally change my perception of the protagonist and antagonist. You also play flashback of different characters each with their unique point of view and you get to understand their rationale of why they did certain things.  I would say that the developer of this game is really a Master Story Teller.This game is defintely not the mindless hack and slash RPG Maker story.It is also not the typical demon-destroy-the-world and you-destroy-the-demon story that is repeated in many rpg games. I would give the plot a A++.As for the downside, a few of the Steam Achievements are not working.However, the developer is actively trying to fix them and release patches of the game whenever he found a solution.In conclusion, this game is defintely worth the $0.89. I would even pay $9.99 for this game as it is better than many of the RPG Maker games that is selling at this price. I own more than 50 RPG Maker games, and I know this genre very well. Good job, developer.			",167,234,0,194,31,0,51

												Got this game from one of the RPG Maker bundles. At first, it didn't look interesting, but when you play it and know what it is about, probably your opinion can change.Story: The curse thing about the story is VERY interesting. The story itself is interesting. The characters have their own personalities. You'll can see some notable influences the story has with japanese culture. It's not a bad thing, but for some people, it isn't interesting. 8/10Gameplay: Well, the overworld gameplay is pretty normal, like any ""normal"" RPG Maker game. But the battles are a little intense, you'll actually use items, skills, even on normal monsters. 7/10Graphics: Is this from the Japanese DLC pack, or something? Anyway, it's good! The sprites are fine, and the mapping is admirable! The developer did a good job with some basic resources. 8/10Sound: The soundtrack is okay. It gives the game some good ambience. 6.5/10Final Score: 8/10. For a RPG Maker game, this is better than expected. The game have nice dialogues, battles that you don't just keep pressing Z/Space/Enter, the maps are well made... The only complain is about the monsters. They are a little repetitive and harsh. It would be interesting something like ""Major Greed"" or ""So-So Sloth"", dunno, heh.Personal Opinion: (Thanks developer for not putting random battles in those big maps...) I still haven't finished it, but I'm willing to. The price is okay, but it's a little cheap for a game that it's actually good for RPG Maker. Give it a try. Too bad those games have the fame of being rushed to be done, or simply bad :/			",131,33,1,28,9,0,7

												I want to love it! I want to keep playing it! The story seems amazing...BUT WHY oh WHY are the fighting system like that?? It's Final Fantasy type of fights ( amazing, love it) but real time - ish...Wich basicly means that the first to use things wins. So basicaly, when you have 20 items, you have to scroll through them while the boss is still attacking... you cycle through skills while the mobs keep attacking...Im sorry, but it just ruins it for me. It's insane! Just let me think this through!!Where is the strategy?? Im Tired of just spamming space bar to be the first to strike with a basic attack...			",66,4,0,12,13,0,2

												Will start with the fact that I expected practicaly nothing from a game I buy for 0,22 EUR, well I was in for a really good surprise. The game practicaly pulled me in with a nice story line and entertinment thro out the game.PROS:1. Awesome story.2. Simplistic and easy to understand3. Has few simple puzzls in it4. Has food crafting system5. Treasure searching systemCONS:1. In a way I didnt like that it had in total 14 different enemys, which made the combat more or less boring at some point.2. No gear or such kind of stat boosting option, except food, that you would need get materials for, but it might be for the best, as it didnt make you think too much.3. Some of the treasures/secrets are made in such way, that if you miss it at the moment when you first come to the area, well you can say goodbye to the secret and the ""Q"" at few of the missions is realy nearly invisable.Summing it all up, I would actualy be ready to pay 2.99 at the least for the fun memorys I gained from this game and the nice vibe it gives. Considering the price I payed and the fun I gaained 10/10			",141,49,0,25,13,1,16

												Let me start this off by saying that I don't really review any games, since most of the games I get are already popular. However I gave this one a shot...At first, I clicked on the game because of the animu picture. Once I heard the cheasy background music for the intro I laughed for a little, but decided to watch through it. Let me tell you that it was worth it. The game was $.89 when I got it as it was on sale for 55% off.The game feels like a classic RPG, and definately brings you back to the olden days of RPG - the ambiance, battle system, storyline, characters, and even the text boxes are reminiscent of some sort of Final Fantasy/Pokemon crossover. I personally love this game right now, especially for the insanely cheap price.If you have a few quarters left over from buying whatever it is you are buying, I'd definately recommend this game.PROS--Pretty good storyline-Good characters and character development-Fun and interesting battle system - active and somewhat challenging to be honest-Not a lot of glitches from what I've seen-Very cheap game-Your brother is a demon-cat thing-Nostalgia inducing-Pretty funny gameCons--A bit short-If you are even remotely near a demon (enemy) they will find you and attack you, Liam Neeson style.

												Holy CRAP. I just finished this game and -man- did it give me an emotional rollercoaster. My heart broke multiple times during this game. Characters were built realitistically, and with strong backgrounds. Story is top-notch, to which I couldn't predict the plot twists (which normally is a piece of cake for me). Combat kept me on the edge of my seat! Short. but sweet and definitely worth the money for the game. 9.5/10 with the .5 off simply because of the fact that it's an RPG-maker game with low graphics. Big whup.			",75,16,1,14,13,1,0

												Interesting story and excellent soundtrack, but the combat mechanics are annoying.  It's like a JRPG except your turns are timed, so you end up playing ""race through menu choices"" in combat.  Maybe other people like it, but to me it just turns into button mashing until you get to the right menu and makes it a lot harder to strategize in combat.  If this one had traditional JRPG combat, it would be a definite recommendation from me.			",65,14,0,20,5,0,9

 About Sins Of The Demon RPGFollow the journey of Kenshi, a wandering demon hunter, and his brother, a demon cat seeking a way to return to his true form. Can they find a way to end the curse and save Lanistra? The Story in Sins Of The Demon RPGYou know that game that makes you skip your bed because you want to continue playing to see what happens next? This game is one of those. The story itself is quite simple if you take the whole bunch, but seeing how the stuff were presented to the player makes it much more immersive and touching, I simply loved how the things developed and at the end I had me like ""Gosh, I want more of this"". The only things that bugs me is about some realism questions like that 10 yr. old boy fighting at your side, but still, I must use the ""fantasy creative freedom"" in order to nullify the value of these question of mine. The Level DesignI'm a bit too overcritical about this since mapmaking is my biggest skill in RPG Maker, but still, this game managed to deliver a well made ""network"" styled maps that gives a good immersion and that I had a lot of fun exploring, for those who don't know that it, is that when maps are strictly connected one to the others, a.k.a., no World Map for travelling and etcoetera (This is not an actual a precise definition but you all must have got the idea right now). What I didn't like a bit was that some times the map feels pretty empty, in the sense like, there could be more details in some parts, but that's okay (I tend to give too much detail to my maps sometimes).Also, the whole country feels pretty small, I think that the developers could've used some graphical resources to make things more countinous. The GameplayOkay, what pisses me off as a developer is to adjust the gameplay in order to keep the difficulty okay (not too easy but also not too hard), this game make things works well, except that sometimes you can power level with ease by leaving and entering on it again. My suggestion to this kind of ""respawn"" is to respawn only certain mobs on the map, let me say, one third of all the mobs? That sounds like pretty reasonable for me, anything to difficult the power level can be used to that, not to mention that there's a way to farm money by making pork buns, and with that, I got like the main character with an ATK of 220 (I could've done more, but I had little time then). Recapitulating, the gameplay fits pretty well the game's purpose, the only complaint are those mathematical and technical questions about leveling up and money making, that doesn't actually ""break"" the game.All in  All Sins Of The Demon RPG	 is a very nice RPG Game!8/10 From Me Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												I just finished this game, and without a doubt, this is the saddest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed game I have ever played, let alone the saddest role playing game. The story in this game is extremely well written, and the world, the characters, and just the whole setting are engrossing and will draw you in. But it's all sad. You have happy moments, but in the end it all ends up being sad. It is also full of several really neat twists to the plot, although a couple of them you can see coming from a bit far away. It doesn't diminish their quality however.The rest of the game supports the story well. It might be an RPG Maker title, but the maps are well done, and all characters sprites are a pleasure to look at. The one thing you may have a problem with is the repetiveness and backtracking, as the entire game takes place on one series of interconnected maps spawninng about six areas with maps in between to travel between them. So you will tread the same ground repeatedly.The battles in the game are enjoyable and fast paced as it is set permanently to an active time battle system. All your commands must be chosen quickly as the enemies will not wait for you. The game has no additional equipment to buy, only items, and also several recipes which you can use to cook healing and stat boosting items. Money is easy to find as you can find various items to sell and then you can either buy items or cooking supplies.Although the enemies do suffer from a bit of repetitiveness as well. The games story does revolve around the seven deadly sins, but you will mainly be seeing enemies based on sloth, greed, wrath, and pride during the game; enemies based on lust, gluttony, and envy, only show up in single areas as you progress, and outside of this you fight bandits. Boss battles, outside of the first one, are usually against one of the more powerful enemies you haven't fought yet, or a huge group of enemies you normally wouldn't encounter together.I got this as part of a $0.65 bundle of titles but you should buy it on its own if any of this sounds appealing to you. Just remember to keep some kleenex handy; you'll understand why.A heavy hearted, teary eyed, JRPG battling, recommendation [full of sadness :( ]			",269,58,1,75,28,1,40

												A great story written game. It has you hooked by it's story of how a boy learns about his true past and has to find those answers. I'm giving this game a 9.5/10 due to some little issues I had to figure out.Issues and some tips if you get stuck. 1) When fighting Shiro and he spams rice rolls (500 Health) = Making it impossible to beat. Tip:: Use your demon form and the first attack that does 4 strikes to lower the 500+ health. (Make sure you farm for Pork Buns and spam them on Kenshi).2) When fighting Isarul, make sure to farm for Pork Buns and get Kenshi's attack Damage when he is attacking up to about 8-1K in dmg. * Do make sure Kenshi and the party are at 12 for their levels. Do the same as with Shiro and it's a simple game here on out. 3) There was a slight issue finding some of the treasure with the map images. Besides that I would recommend this game.

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I was expecting a bland, generic game with no standout points, but ended up enjoying the story a great deal. While many aspects of the game itself are nothing special (art direction, music, skills, combat system, etc.), the writing, in my opinion, was good enough to distinguish the game from its peers in the genre. Added to which, at the price (especially on sale), you get a decent amount of game for your money.If you don't go in expecting too much, you may well end up enjoying your stay. Recommended for anyone looking for a light-hearted game, or for anyone with a passing interest in JRPGs.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got the game on sale figuring ""I'm paying £0.20, even if it's terrible it'll be worth it for the steam cards,"" and I was pleasantly surprised.Pros:-Engaging story, with surprising depth.-Interesting and likeable characters.-Decent combat, reminiscent of old-style RPGs.-Good length. Despite not being the 12 hours of gameplay promised, my first run of the game took 10.5 hours, so it's still very good for the price.Cons:-The combat is easily broken if you find certain exploits.-If you're an achievement fanatic/completionist, it's very frustrating to be forced to replay the entire game for one or two missed collectables.Overall a very enjoyable experience. 8/10.

												If you really want a simple RPG with a base storyline and you are a fan of mysticism and such, this is the game for you. I would highly recommend this game for those who like a bit of a throwback on their plate mixed with a heaping dose of nostalgia.PROS:-A simple objective for a player. With an ultimatum goal in his mind.-Deep mired character that unravels as you go.-COOKING! Normally seen in those TALES games. Its a refreshing change of pace in a top down RPG.-Witty cutscenes that you have to watch.-Journals: So you can keep track of what you are doing in the game and not get confused where you left off. This is huge and paramount to RPG's nowadays. It definitely helped.CONS:-Lack of customization: No way to improve stat's via equipment change or getting new weapons or add ons. I have played this game for a bit and have yet to see such things. -COOKING: It only heals health. No strength bonuses. No stat bonuses. Just health.-May possibly be a short game. All in all: 8.5/10This is one of those flawed masterpieces that one shouldn't overlook. There may be those flaws as stated above, but the gameplay and story overshadow some of these. This is probably the programmer's first attempt at such a game. Maybe, maybe not. But I am eager to see future works from whomever made this. I would give you a round of applause. This game has captured me.It is a compelling story. One worth taking the journey on.			",70,4,0,19,3,0,0

For less than 50 cents, this game is surely something to enjoy!I like how the story set sail at the start of the game, of which it's actually a cutscene from the last level fight, super cool.I've been amazed by the story the whole time I was playing this game. The story plot is well-arranged, a twist here and there to make things entertaining. Characters have fun dialogues and played their roles well, so there wasn't really any dull event in the game. The downsides of it are that the battle system forces you to act quickly, which is mainly spamming the attack button for grinding, but that's no doubt one of the core concept of playing rpgs. You could also actually get stucked if you push a boulder to the dungeon entrance, but I doubt anyone's as stupid as me to do that. A little of map layout bugs here and there, but honestly they're all too little to notice. The textures, soundtracks, sounds and game resources are a bit on the cliche side as well, could be a bummer if you're looking for cool soundtracks, but I honestly didn't expect much from such a small price tag. This game did fairly well for it's range, honestly.Grinding only took around 2-3 hours, nothing extraordinary or weird to nitpick, it's a great game if you're a light-hearted RPG-type fan who loves to explore around. To put up short, Sins of The Demon is great with its story, while still being balanced with every other aspects you'd find in a RPG Maker game.While this marks my 20th achievement-aced game, I'm still in the process of finding something more seasonal to play. I'd love to hear out game recommendation from the people around ",221,62,5,17,16,4,25

												This game is way better than it has any right to be, even more for its price.I initially bought it because it was extremely cheap and expected absolutely nothing out of it, except maybe getting my rpg fix, as I would most likely enjoy anything that isnt too bad.And at first I thought it was exactly that, felt like it was a generic story in a underground game that no one would really care, but then as it developed, Sins Of The Demon showed that they werent afraid of making things end in a grim way, many times refusing to use the good generic solution where everything ends happily ever after, which helps in developing its characters even further and coming out as a good tragedy worthy of anyone's time.I would also like to point out that there are places in this game where you will explore and the only thing you will gain out of it is pure lore, it is an especially nice touch, and makes the experience way richer, would personally recommend this to anyone who wants to just enjoy a good story while exploring the world.

You also get to play as the character in flashbacks needed to progress knowledge of the story. All in all a well-rounded great game.			",57,25,2,3,8,2,2

												Short and sweet! There's not much in the way of side-quests, and you will have to grind to fight some of the bigger bosses, but the story's pretty solid, and the characters are interesting and likeable, particularly the two brothers. My biggest complaint is that there's no ability to upgrade weapons or armor, but for something simple to put on to play before bed, I enjoyed myself.TLDR; a very simple, short game, but likeable.

												TL;DR: Probably the best storytelling in an RPG ever. Play this game.I don't usually write reviews, but damn, this game.Probably the best writing I've ever seen, and I've played a LOT of RPGs during the last 10 years. Nothing is what it seems. The story is amazingly well-written and executed, the dialogues are amazing, and although I was skeptical at first, the skits give you a completely different feel for the game. For the first time in an RPG do you actually see the party bond during the journey, intead of just suddenly being BFFs after a couple of stupid cutscenes. The characters idly chat, joke, make silly comments, bond and get to know each other in a way I have never seen before in an RPG. The closest thing to this I've ever played was To the moon.I really can't stress how good the story in this game is. Nothing ends up being the way you thought it would, and you constantly have to reconsider past events. The game does so much to get you in touch with the characters, which just makes the events that happen so much more touching. And my god, the dialog is INTELLIGENT. I am so tired of being insulted by ""Oh, no, who would do such a thing?! What a jerk!"" and the likes, but this game. THIS GAME! Every single line made sense and felt natural. The characters didn't feel like they had the minds of 3-year-olds, but of real people. Japanese RPGs often have so cringy lines, and even English ones rarely have writing this good. The game is also ridiculously long for such a cheap game. 1€ for over 10 hours of story? This was worth more than that, but I'm afraid I'd never have found the game if it wasn't so cheap in the first place...That being said, the game has its flaws. The combat system is a bit bland, and there are few abilities and interaction between them. You'll almost always just paralyze/tackle/blind the enemy and bash them to death with a couple of double-hit attacks. At some point you also unlock the ability to craft stat items which even sell for more than the ingredients you need for them, so you can essentially get infinite money and stats by just cooking repeatedly. This was... boring. I ended up using Cheat Engine to skip the grinding and max out my stats simply to advance the story faster. Luckily, you can avoid most battles (it was an excellent choice to not have random battles!) and even the bosses aren't terribly difficult once you unlock the stat items and grind cooking for a few minutes. Still, the focus is on the excellent storytelling and writing, and the game is more than worth your time despite the combat system not being too interesting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't know what I was getting into when I got this game. I had seen it flashing by a couple of times, but I had never felt convinced up until now.I was in an RPG mood, so I gave it a try (the game was on sale, so I grabbed it).The story had more depth to it than I expected it would have.I found the characters likeable. I easily grew fond of them.This game plays like a very compact, extremely basic and simplistic RPG.There's no fancy equipment whatsoever. The mobs are quite idiotic (I liked their design, but their battle AI was poor).The story did make up for all of this. The story is what drove me to finish the game and I'm glad I did - it was rather touching. More so than I had expected!It's one of those stories where the plot is revealed thru flashbacks - this was done quite well, I must say.I am content. Glad I played. Lots of time spent going back-and-forth though (way too much time - a lot of it could have been cut down and replaced with more original content).All-in-all, the game is okay. There were some dull moments, but the story left me in tears nonetheless - ouch!NB the cover pic for this game is rather misleading - the character in the pic is a Lust Demon (there's only a single apparition of such a demon in game, and it's not even part of the main plot - more like a subplot)I do not take well to false or misleading advertisement... and I feel like the developers would benefit more if they changed it - it's not exactly representative of what the game is about (I'm hoping they'll change it)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was very enjoyable. The story was quite interesting, and the battles where a nice challenge. I liked the idea of the optional skits, they really added depth into the characters and story. For 1.99 this game was definitly worth it, especially since it was quite long too. I would recomend this game.			",22,5,1,9,3,0,0

												Note: This review does NOT contain any spoilers + The game absorbs you instantly in it's world perfectly. + Excellent story, with a great flow. + Very amazing design on maps which allows explorers a lot of fun! + Side quests are elegantly designed. + Most humor was well delivered, I had tears laughing time to time. - Battle difficulty is considerably inconsistent and probably way too hard for someone who are not familiar with rpg combat mechanics. - There are some weird, small flaws, like Kenshi saying ""I don't need to go in there"" when he is not even in party. I guess that's understandable in indie stuff though. - Cooking is one of the key features in game, and has a big effect on Kenshi's personality and stuff, yet has a poorly designed interface.Was a great experience overall, I want to thank to the amazing small team of designers for allowing me to have this experience. I recommend Sins of the Demon to everyone who would enjoy an amazing story in a JRPG game.			",3,0,0,0,1,0,2

												There are countless RPG Maker games around. This one plays like something that should be free, in terms of quality and story. - I found the premise dumb, uninspired and it failed to make me give two hoots. - The introduction contained grammatical errors (the usual ""it's"" instead of ""its""). - Battles are in real-time and take place fast, so instead of strategising, it all boils down to reaction time. - Side quests expire, so they need to be completed in a linear fashion, and not in free time.- Landscapes and environments are boring, mainly yellow and fail to convey a sense of immersion.- Lead character and his cat brother are not likeable, mainly due to poor dialogue.- Dialogue and story setup/flow lack depth and come across as being written by a kid or teen.This game might appeal to a younger audience because it has a cat that looks cute and can fight.I like my games with a strong plot and compelling narrative, which this game lacks to provide. The so-called ""story"" and dialogue are abysmal. If you can overlook this point, then maybe you might want to give this a try. But I wouldn't pay to play this.			",166,146,6,23,20,5,27

												So, I'm not the person who plays a lot of RPG Maker games, even though I've been working with the software for years, let me say that this was my first game after a long time, and I must say I'm impressed about it, I'll be a bit analytical sometimes in this review because I want to share some points as a developer as well, so let's start:Story:You know that game that makes you skip your bed because you want to continue playing to see what happens next? This game is one of those. The story itself is quite simple if you take the whole bunch, but seeing how the stuff were presented to the player makes it much more immersive and touching, I simply loved how the things developed and at the end I had me like ""Gosh, I want more of this"". The only things that bugs me is about some realism questions like that 10 yr. old boy fighting at your side, but still, I must use the ""fantasy creative freedom"" in order to nullify the value of these question of mine.Gameplay:Okay, what pisses me off as a developer is to adjust the gameplay in order to keep the difficulty okay (not too easy but also not too hard), this game make things works well, except that sometimes you can power level with ease by leaving and entering on it again. My suggestion to this kind of ""respawn"" is to respawn only certain mobs on the map, let me say, one third of all the mobs? That sounds like pretty reasonable for me, anything to difficult the power level can be used to that, not to mention that there's a way to farm money by making pork buns, and with that, I got like the main character with an ATK of 220 (I could've done more, but I had little time then). Recapitulating, the gameplay fits pretty well the game's purpose, the only complaint are those mathematical and technical questions about leveling up and money making, that doesn't actually ""break"" the game.Level Design:I'm a bit too overcritical about this since mapmaking is my biggest skill in RPG Maker, but still, this game managed to deliver a well made ""network"" styled maps that gives a good immersion and that I had a lot of fun exploring, for those who don't know that it, is that when maps are strictly connected one to the others, a.k.a., no World Map for travelling and etcoetera (This is not an actual a precise definition but you all must have got the idea right now). What I didn't like a bit was that some times the map feels pretty empty, in the sense like, there could be more details in some parts, but that's okay (I tend to give too much detail to my maps sometimes).Also, the whole country feels pretty small, I think that the developers could've used some graphical resources to make things more countinous I suppose? Overall:A pretty well made game, even with those petty defects that I mentioned it managed to give me a lot of fun while playing it, I definitely recommend it, it was totally worth my money. I rate 8.75 / 10.			",49,1,3,4,1,1,0

												Full Review!For my original Quick First Look just scroll down a bit.Sins of the Demon RPG is a RPGMaker VXAce game that tells the story of Kenshi and his cat-companion, who is actually his brother turned into demon form. Their quest takes place in a fictious Samurai-era Japan called Lanistra.This is a very story heavy game, meaning there are quite some cutscenes. Especially towards the middle of the game there are a lot of them, almost reminiscent of some japanese games nowadays. However it must be pointed out that those cutscenes, as well as almost all of the dialogue never drag on or get boring. There are quite a lot of twists and turns going on; some of which the player might see coming and few one won't, or at least I did not.With this focus on story telling one might wonder how linear Sins of the Demon is. While it is always clear where to go to next and what to do, there is room for small exploration. However, since parts of the world only become accessible once the story has progressed further, exploration is limited.Same goes for the RPG battles. There are no random encounters and monsters are always visigle on the map. Once defeated they disappear but respawn if you reenter an area.Battle system itself is turn-based utilizing an ATB, active time battle system. Similar to Final Fantasy games that used this system it means, that once an an attack bar has been filled up several options including attack, skill become available. Just don't forget that enemies won't wait their turn and attack once they can attack i.e. their bar has filled up. This makes battles become quite hectic at times. One oddity need to be mentioned however and that is quite a miss rate on attacks (both regular and skill attacks). While those misses happen random, they used to happen way more often than in other games and can become quite annoying at times.Another downside for some may the absence weapon customizations or ability of changing gear at all. There are skills that will unlock once the characters reach a certain level, but the player will get all once they reach level 10. Leveling up more will ""only"" increase stats, which can be done by finding certain recipes and crafting food items too.Overall this game still deserves a recommendation if you are looking for a RPG with focus on story telling and less focus on fighting will find a fair adventure here. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but since all works pretty and the price of admission is fair, it is hard to not recommend Sins of the Demon!Quick First Look!!Sins of the Demon RPG is a RPGMaker VXAce game that tells the story of Kenshi and his cat-companion, who is actually his brother turned into demon form. Their quest takes place in a fictious Samurai-era Japan.So far the main story has been progressing steadily in a pretty linear fashion. There are small sidequests that the player will have to discover on their own; there are no special indicators on the NPC that offer those, however some will be quite obvious to find and others just by randomly talking to. Actual conversations are pretty spot on and always stay on topic, no unnecessary babbling and/or vulgarities. While traveling to the different locations enemies will always be visible as there are no random encountes. Most of the time it is even possible to outrun enemies, because they will start to follow you for a bit once they spot you.Battlesystem is relying on ATB (active time battle) which should be familiar to anybody who has played some Final Fantasy games before. While it is turn-based at its core, player and enemy will be able to perform actions once their ATB bar fills up. Enemies won't wait their turn, but do so the moment they can. Battles themselves have been fairly easy so far, just keep an eye on your health bar and a few health items stocked and you won't be having any real problems.Player levelling and enemy difficulty itself feels very well balanced.Overall I can say that this is a nice little JRPG style game that may not bring anything new to the table, but since nothing seems to be broken, you always have the feeling of making some progress and for the price of admission you can do a lot worse, is worth a recommendation. Especially newcomers to the genre will find a nice starting point here as it always clear what you are supposed to do and where to go next!			",143,26,2,21,2,1,3

												1) Good story that'll keep you interested from start to end. (Abit generic at time but still good)2) Well worth the price its being sold at3) Somewhat challenging battles without grinding but definitely beatable.4) Game feels incomplete. There is one ingredient in the game that isn't needed to make anything. Oddly enough some items are cheaper to buy than craft which makes no sense at all... Maybe it does if you think of it in a weird way. A couple of locations that aren't used in the game in any meaningful way. I give this game a 8/10 considering the low low price its sold at.

												Great story, enjoyable characters, and highly enjoyable overall. The combat is a bit tricky, since with the 'active' combat, trying to select an item or power before you get smashed with a rage barrage or something is not that easy. However, this is not totally unsalvageable, since if you really struggle, you can power up your stats by cooking certain foods, thereby making you a certifiable badass and letting you kill the boss in two hits. Go you, you incredible cook.But really, 9/10. I was very impressed, seeing as some RPG maker games can be pretty poor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game feels very unpolished with many bugs from pathing issues to what is very likely mistakes due to lazy copy and paste. In addition, it has an issue where misses are usually what kill you. You could be overleveled and still die due to misses. As such, one fight is almost pure RNG if you weren't ready for the fight as there is a save point and if you use the save point, you can't go back to shop, turning the fight into an RNG test of frustration. There are even battles that are clearly unbeatable normally due purely out of the fact that your character has skills that cannot be used.What bothered me most was that most of my deaths felt cheap where I lost to RNG or to fights that were after a long expedition with no save point until after the fight in question.There is a lot of running back and forth pointlessly, causing the player to revisit the same areas over and over again. There are also the oh so fun consideration of content that makes little sense, including characters being able to pass over impassible objects and objects being re-initialized during cutscenes, often turning the objects into completely different items such as a path turning into a fence as a result of using the wrong map for a cutscene.And with objects, it is rather confusing when you have the same resources for both active event objects that can be picked up AND for inactive event objects that can't be interacted with.If that wasn't enough, a lot of the skits don't pop up right away as they appear to be timed. This means you could enter a cutscene and the skit won't appear until the cutscene is already in progress, making skits missable due to appearing during a cutscene or scene transition.Another worrying thing is that the credits suggest that they do not know if they actually have the proper rights for certain resources in the game. For a commercial game, they should know exactly whether or not they have the rights to use the resources in the game.			",549,219,8,92,63,4,86

What's For The Situation?Sloth, energy, fierceness, resent, pride, covetous, and crave; these may appear like the eager states of some individual spending an end of the week in Vegas anyway they're truly the purpose behind the new RPG Sins of the Shrewd Soul. Sins of the Malicious nearness happens in where there is Lanistra, a world that has been in turmoil since the removal of the villain Isharul. As his naughtiness was obliged from Lanistra, Isharul set an upbraid upon land; any person who again and again submits one of the seven lethal sins changes into a malevolent soul. For the all inclusive community of Lanistra, all trust is lost, unless a legend can create to lift the chide from the land. This is the fundamental setup for Sins of the Malevolent Soul, the beforehand specified legend is Kenshi, a demon seeker who sets out from town to town with Shinto, his kin. Shinto isn't just Kenshi's kin, he is moreover a fallen angel, and a catlike, who can talk (basically keep running with it). To various, this will all seem, by all accounts, to be really standard for a redirection made in RPG maker; battle animals, invigorate your social affair, save the world, wash and repeat. In any case, this is unquestionably not a treat cutter RPG, everything from fight to character associations are executed in an innovative and fun way. The gameplay in Sins of the Malicious Soul will be outstanding to any person who's played a Super NES period RPG. In any case, any enthusiast of RPG's will see some huge complexities after only two or three minutes of gameplay. The battle system is the essential thing that sets Sins of the Shrewd isolated from the sea of RPG Maker entertainments that litter Steam's store page. The beguilement uses a Dynamic Time Battle System (ATB) which infers that enemies will continue assaulting your social occasion whether you've picked a charge or not. This battle structure makes the redirection's fight speedy and wild, while so far obliging players to use approach to be viable. It makes the fight feel like a session of speed chess, simply pounding the strike is an equation for dissatisfaction. A Worship For Sustenance Talking about recipes, Sins of the Malicious furthermore uses an especially made cooking system which grants players to forte prosperity restoring support things from fixings accumulated through the entertainment. The structure replaces the routine Motel System, where a social affair can be completely recovered by napping in a bed. Here, the most ideal approach to patch your social affair is to either make support things from fixings found through examination and fight, or to buy those sustenance things from shops. Making a player need to spend either money or supplies to recuperate prosperity adds an advantages organization segment to the preoccupation and offers stakes to the gameplay. Much like the fight, this repairing structure obliges players to meticulously consider their exercises. ""Should I cook a rice ball now for a dab of prosperity, or peril chasing down more fixings to cook the more helpful sushi?"" These are the sorts of request that players will dependably be thinking about, you never get something forever and every action has a result. Sins of the Malicious moreover breaks RPG custom by barring any sort of weapon structure in the delight, so there's no buffing out character subtle elements by supplanting weapons and support. In a comparable vein, there's no detail customization when a character venture up, most of the character's subtle elements basically augment at a persevering rate. At in any case, it gives off an impression of being odd that a RPG that unmistakably has had so much care put into its arrangement would disregard to consolidate this key worker. Regardless, as with retouching, the character customization is used through the diversion's cooking system. Around the end of the essential show of the redirection, players are given the ability to cook or purchase unprecedented character buffing supports that grants players to tailor their subtle elements to their adoring. Using the cooking structure to make both prosperity things and detail buffs is an entrancing worker and is even laced with the redirection's story. Kenshi's love for sustenance and cooking is one of his vital character traits. Right when the cooking repairman is given it enjoyably dovetails what you certainly think about the character, which is attracting as the gameplay grows normally from the redirection's story. From an unadulterated gameplay perspective there's little to fuss about. The diversion's inconvenience scales wonderfully with your get-together's development, keeping the gameplay testing while never making you have to expel your hair. The essential story mission times in at around ten hours with an extra three hours of side missions. Inquisitively, a bit of the side excursions are only available in the midst of a particular window of time in the redirection, once that window closes players can't get to those missions. This will no ifs ands or buts aggravate a couple of players, be that as it may it urges you to totally research a range before moving onto another district. Secures Sins of the Underhanded looks like a standard RPG Maker preoccupation, yet the overall laid out gameplay and the immersive story show that it is unquestionably not. Both the Dynamic Time Battle system and how cooking is used as a character development laborer make a nice mix of new and understood entertainment mechanics. Incorporate an intriguing and interfacing with plot and any enthusiast of Super NES period RPG's will watch this preoccupation to be certainly advocated even in spite of the cost of attestation.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Very fun RPG, exactly what I was looking for (I miss this format...). The memory 'game-scenes' were kind of long and didn't make me want to play them much since I knew any levels gained wouldn't be retained, but it was fun to actively interact in them. Another drawback of the game is the fact that there were no weapon/armor shops or equipment swap for that matter =/ But overall totally worth playing it once :) Gratz to the developers...

												I have no idea what the people giving this game a negative review, are upset about. Perhaps they've had previous versions which were buggy or have a different Active-Time Battle system, but it's a well-done mechanism. You will most likely have some trouble getting used to it at the beginning (As did I), but that's pretty much because you only start with 2 characters in your party.The ATB doesn't feel like much for the first half of the game, but when you reach the second half of the game, you'll probably start realizing the system to its full potential. Health, SP (Equivalent of Mana), buffs, debuffs, you'll need to manage all of these simultaneously if you wish to win any fight later in the game, and the ATB system makes it quite challenging.I just wanted to clear this up, also I think the ATB system has been updated, because I haven't encountered anything similiar to the complaints about the battle system.This game isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's definitely an enjoyable experience for an RPGMaker game. Music is a bit repetitive, enemies are limited, attacks are limited, dialogues are actually nice and creative, but the writing has some grammatical errors if you read it carefully.Overall, it's a pretty decent game and definitely worth more than its price.

												For such a cheap game it provides a lot, a intersting story with a twist, likeable characters; nice music .It reminded me very much of all of the old style rpg's like the original final fantasy's as you can see from the games screenshots. The only problem I had with it was that I couldn't ""shift tab"" to bring up steam like you can in other games; it may have been because I was full screen maybe but I don't know; didn't take anything away from the game of course. For the price you pay you get a game that I would have happily paid more for, it is worth more than the price it is so it is definatly a steal.Even if you are only slightly interested in trying the game it is only 79p, stop being so tight and try it :P			",29,20,0,12,6,1,1

												Yo everyone. I'll write something what I don't usually write. This game is worth it's price and could easily cost more! To be more specific, the plot is very good, it keeps a player interested and wondering what will be the next twist. Moreover, Idk if it's a good usage of this word but it's kind of challenging to meet all of the requirements for certain side quests (if you find them ofc, which is nicely hidden and only for explorers : D). I had a really great time playing this title and it is rare these days. Almost every game put graphics above a plot and I can't stand it. Here is, as you could say, ""the old school"" of games (not mentioning that it's done in rpg maker I guess, but it's off-topic). ANYWAY...I'm giving 10/10 for entertainment it gave me. I'll miss this game and I really would like to rewind time and play it again without knowing what awaits me. It's a game which switches a player's feelings as it wishes. One second you are sad, then the very next one makes you smile. I'm very glad I got to play a game like this one and hopefully I'll get to play some more of these : DTill the next time DEV!P.S.10/10 : DP.P.S.Btw, people under 1 hour in-game shouldn't be able to review.

On the journey you meet two more companions (4 person party RPG system) that help you fight as you explore the land, do side quests, make the moneys, do some cooking, level up, get better items, and overall, enjoy an awesome story. Truly, this story is heartwarming - I would pay 20 bucks for a sequel, that's how invested I was in the characters by the end of it. Love it!

												This game is a mixed bag for me. Its story is one of the best I've ever seen in an RPG maker game. It resolves every issue it initiates, the characters and their interactions are more likable than not, and the world is designed in such a way that the you can continue the story or complete most side quests at your leisure . I also love the way that the game handles flashbacks. Most other games will simply tell you a characters backstory through dialogue, or a cinematic with some sort of visual effect. This game will actually put you in control of a character to see their past from their perspective. Not only does this make the story-telling more interesting, but the few minutes in between story events during flashbacks give you a chance to save or explore the world of the past between loads of exposition.I really don't have anything to say against the story. My main problem is the game mechanics. Characters can attack and use special attacks that cost some SP, but most of the special attacks consist of stronger attacks. Some can raise ally stats and lower those of enemies, but thats about as deep as it goes. Even the abilites available late game consist of changing stats and strong attacks. And enemies use similiar abilities, give or take a status effect or two. There aren't any elemental weaknesses or skill trees, and the worst part is that there isn't even equipment! If you check a characters status you'll see their default equipment, but there is no way to upgrade or change it. Another problem is that the ""active time"" battle system might as well be a turn based one.  Whenever characters aren't acting an action gauge will fill up. Once it's full that character can take an action. But there isn't any way to choose the order in which your characters will take their turns, so the only thing that you can do other than move your characters in the default order, is to wait for the enemy to move first and then move your characters in the default order. This leaves very little room for strategy and the way the game handles items and money doesn't make it any better. One problem is the cooking mechanic. It's a simple crafting mechanic that allows you to combine ingredient items to make food items (most of which act as healing items). However some ingedients cost significantly less than the food items can sell for, so you can abuse this to make a fortune buying low and selling high. On top of that, you'll eventually unlock recipes that allow you to make stat increasing items that you can make to you're hearts content with the money shopkeepers will give you for food made with their own ingredients. At this point its a question of if you want to stock up on healing items or raise your characters stats to broken levels, but there is absolutely nothing stopping you from doing both. The fact that the game doesn't give you any incentive to play fair and gives you every opportunity to exploit its mechanics makes me think the developers knew that most players would just want to get on with the story. All that said, if you're looking to follow a decent story for about ten hours you'll probably enjoy this game. If you'll looking for a fun battle system you definitely won't. If you're looking for both you'll likely have very mixed feelings after finishing this game, and that is where I stand as of now.			",70,9,0,4,0,0,2

												The story is BRILLIANT I really love it.I love Shinto.I love the story.However, the developer didn't really polish the combat system very well.Fights are long and tendious and you find yourself spamming healing items even after LONG sessions of gridning.I give this game thumbs in the middle if I could.Again EPIC story.  I really liked it.If you're not easily frustrated by BAD and I mean BAD fighting mechantics, then play this game for the story as the author really did a wonderful job on it.I just wish the combat system was just as good.

												Definitely one of the better RPGs I've gotten off of steam, and at .49 cents it's a steal.  Granted, I screwed around a bit more than most people probably would, but I got 10+ hours of garmeplay.  The story is great, and for the most part it was well written.  There are a few parts that could have been better written but overall the characters are interesting and the story keep you intrigued.  Can't ask much more from a cheap buy as a whim game.  My only real complaint is that it wasn't longer/more expansive.			",17,3,0,7,4,0,2

If you ever played golden sun, link to the past.. or any kind of old rpg with a great story you will definitely like this one.  If you ever played a 'gameboy' kinda game on computer and you liked i say go for it. BEST 54 CENTS EVER !!! The story is great, you get attach easily to the caracters. The story is suprising really. You get thrilled by it and wonder what's going on. About 10-15h of gamplay, depending if you take secondary quests or not. I'm not the type to make review. I only do it because i was so surprise about this. Never thought I would enjoy it that much. Have fun !! :3  ",126,30,1,33,4,0,2

												This is actually the first RPG game that I actually finished and it was well worth it. This RPG game got me hooked throughout the whole game. It was a fun, adventurous, and awesome game filled with mystery, plot twist, demons, and never ending adventures. I actually love the storyline and dialogue for the characters. The characters dialogue on this game are pretty funny and it will give you a couple of laughs. Just be prepared to do some grinding near the end of the game.... that is if you want to beat a boss without difficulty. All in all, this game is pretty fun, entertaining, adventurous, and hilarious. There will be some happy, shocking, scary, and sad moments in the game but I think you guys/ladies would enjoy this game. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves to play RPG Adventurous games.			",555,145,3,26,16,4,3

												I GREATLY dislike the fighting system of this game.  The combination of an active fighting system with menu-driven system is just frustrating.  Simple attack is easy, but trying to select a spell or item from the right character while in the heat of battle is ridiculous.  Healing is virtually impossible.  The story was interesting, but not worth the frustration.			",1417,604,40,194,134,13,230

												A decent game with some pretty good/funny writing. Story is interesting enough, a demon cursed the land turning anyone who commits one of the seven deadly sins into a demon that represents said sin, a boy and his brother/cat (from what we know he turned into a cat before even he can remember. Im sure we'll find out with some further gameplay) are on a journey to try and break the curse the demon set out 20 years prior. With some grinding, some exploration, a few side quests here and there and some overdue battles with pesky demons maybe we'll lift this curse and turn poor Shinto back into a human! Oh, and get Kenshi some much needed food! Alot of aspects are borrowed from games like Tales of Vesperia and other similar JRPGs such as the random optional side conversations, the scattered save points, the love of cooking food. With more old school RPG fight systems similar to the original final fantasy(s) but instead of the side by side turn based fight system it's more real time, if you sit there and don't attack they'll attack over and over until you die instead of pausing for your turn. Limits slow paced strategy but I guess that's all in the challange! I'd recommend it at the discount/bundle price. These RPG maker games are usually decent enough as long as the creator can manage an original enough story. Plus it has trading cards and achievements so why not.			",55,8,0,12,5,4,6

												very short BACK TRACKING rpg gameyou go through the same areas over and over and over backtracking is the basis of this game.  Since there is only about 7 areas to go in.bout 5-10 hours ish depending on how much you grind and farm for items n stufftheres no equipment, only stat gains from levels and items you can createwhich totals up to... like 10 items for the whole game.  stat boosting, health and magic replenishingone thing that was annoying is the cancel button does not work like its supposed to sometimes.  example theres a cooking\crafting section to the game, every time you use the cancel button it acts like you're using the select button so you hafta scroll down the menu of food you cook to the cancel button every time.nice story, game gives me a weeaboo feeling though.might redo the game... since i know what happens :( also i missed a few items n cutscenes apparently.hope the makers do well on their future games.

												This is an overall okay rpg game.The good thing about it, is the story. It hooks me and also have a lot of very surprising twist and turn.The game dev took effort to put in background/flashback stories for various characters. The bad things about it, no equipment for your heroes at all.The quest rewards and chests are recovery items or $, that's all.This is really weird and different from all the rpgs out there.Because of this, I don't really bother to open treasure chests. (Cause no surprise elements or new/good equip for heroes).The next is getting you to backtrack here and there to places for at least a few times in main story. (side quests too).The battle system, overall is okay, but the miss rate is kind of frustrating at times, (Especially if you used a high TP skill) you can miss  or enemy took no damage.Overall, I recommend it due to the low pricing and good story for this game.

												This game is really nice for what it is. It hardly reinvents the wheel, but if you liked Final Fantasy 4, 5, 6, or The After Years... you'll enjoy this game. Just be sure to look at the screenshots to make sure you understand what you're getting before you buy it.Without spoiling too much, this is a game that includes a lot of cheesy Japanese culture references, along with a few mythological references and some plot twists that might remind you of Star Wars. You can tell the game was created by someone who plays games, and there's even a house in the first town where three guys are having a very typical argument that you hear among nerds. The game often feels surprisingly light-hearted and self-critical of JRPG tropes, although it gets darker near the end.However, don't sit around level grinding too much. Let's just say that there's only about 20 hours of gameplay here, and if you go much past level 20, you completely mess up the difficulty curve and make the main game really easy. Also, a lot of the more difficult sequences take place in the past and force you to use different characters than usual, effectively negating the effort you put into grinding. So really, just don't do it.  ",28,2,0,5,0,0,1

												I bought this when it is on sale for $0.49 cents since I am a cheapo, I dont use steam much and just really didnt like steam games. Honestly I tried out Tales of Zesteria and Symphonia and the storylines bored to to death, however this one was quite engaging and interesting. The plot is fast paced and the characters are quite funny. The game itself is classic RPG maker styled and it runs smoothly. The concept of the game is also very nice and unique with time-sensative combat, since in reality no monster will wait for your ""turn"" in a fight, and these monsters don't drop gold, only bandits, aka human enemies do, which is sensible. The story is also set in a historical setting, like back in the old days where there are shacks and lords and things of that sort. Overall I really loved this game and I often refund every game that is boring to me, which is 100% of the games until I found this one. I really loved it.			",6,4,0,2,0,0,2

												This game was precious and honestly heartbreaking. I definitely teared up a few times, but it was worth it. I really recommend it to anyone who is a fan of RPGs and wants something cute and casual to play, even though you may get invested in the characters like I did.It's a relatively short game, but it does have a few challenging parts to it. The gameplay style is interesting; I really expected it to be turned based, but it isn't. The characters, as usual, were my favorite part. I got really attached to Kenshi and Shinto. Overall, the plot was pretty good, although at some times it seemed rushed. I understand that it was probably necessary to rush some parts though to keep it moving. I'm probably off to draw fanart of Kenshi and Shinto.			",14,11,0,10,3,0,1

												I haven't played through much but there is a few things I wanted to say. Your story telling is good. You have a good pace, I felt comfortable reading and enjoyed learning about the characters. Shinto really grew on me, especially how he sat on Kenshi's head. I can tell you put alot of work into this game and you are a talented artist. My critique is the interface. Other than that it's the music that plays inside of houses and shops. Find a new track or improve that one. I recommend this game! It's a good story and solid gameplay! Don't be fooled that it's it's an rpg maker game so you think it won't be any good.

												""Enemy is Paralyzed""Kenshi attacks!""misses""my experience when starting the game.It has a very nice story and the combat made you move your fingers more as opposed to spamming the ""confirm"" button you would need to be quick to execute and combo your attacks otherwise the enemy would have the advantage. That however is an illusion tho.Game is pretty newbie friendly,nothing is too hard for you to handle even if it seems so, you have all the firepower you need to win, unless the game made you lose on purpose just to get on with the story.The combat system is enjoyable but I do not recommend this game if you are only in it for ""fighting"" and ""strategy"" or ""BREAK THE GAME MAX ALL STATS"" kind of things, you can max stats but it wouldnt be worth it considering you can finish the game without Maxed Stuff and just juke the enemies around you, which I love as opposed to random encounters out in the fields like other RPGs.Running is an option too if you want but that happens rarely for me anyways.Story ehh... just play for yourself and feel the feels. But very original and pleasant to read like a visual novel but with pixels?Buy it if you feel like going on a feels trip or just a quick RPG you want to play.9/10 for this game if it werent for the fact the main char is related to ""ERMHEM"" just get it.

												Decent game. I extremely do not like not being able to heal at an inn (at least I haven't found one).Combat is fine, but I do not like real time battles (you always lose time to make decisions).Only 1 hour into the game and its OK. Some of the game play has me intrigued into how it was done, but this is probably not a good point as I look at it in a way of how I can do some of those things for a game I'm making.I do recommend it as it is a challenge and not boring. But For the things I don't like, it gets 6/10.*update - At the end of the game but cannot finish. boss is too hard. My characters do nothing except heal. Most of my gameplay was avoiding battles as they are too challenging for me.Good side is lots of story for those that like that. But I like a little story, not a lot.Really wasn't a game for me. Still well made.			",16,43,0,24,0,0,1

While I can attest that this game will prove little challenge to a veteran Final Fantasy player who knows what they are doing (read: grinding) I will say that the story interwoven into this game was  very good. The game was fun and comfortable, by which I mean that it was relaxing to play. I definitely recommend giving this game a try if it goes on sale and even if it's not because it is well worth the price. It is an excellent remedy for those suffering from what I call ""AAA Game Fatigue.""			",17,1,0,7,0,0,1

												I rather enjoyed this game. Combat is really basic and simple, map somewhat small (but still fun to explore). Where this game shines is the concept of monsters and the story itself. Won't go too much into detail so i don't spoil anything. All in all, i recommend it, game costs next to nothing (i recommend getting it in this bundle). It should take about 10 hrs to beat it, maby more if you want to 100% it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got it from the rng bundle and played the whole 10 hours in one sitting. Overall I enjoyed the story and the gameplay itself was decently paced to where I didn't feel like I needed to grind much if at all.The only complaint I really have is I enjoy purely turned based combat as I dont have to worry about taking too long and the opponent getting free hits.

												First things first: If you're a fan of RPG Maker games, you probably already have this game simply for the layout and title. For those who aren't quite huge fans, I definetly recommend this game mainly for its story, not only its a plot that will keep you out of bed for making you want to know how the story unfolds, but also will make you empathize with the characters ( which have a great background and are quite solid on their personalities ).The map is ""tight-connected"", not a huge map with a vast exploration, but rather a right sized one where you'll find yourself easily exploring it, it's a perfect fit for the game and its story. While the graphics are like most RPGMaker games, it will still be quite immersive.Probably the only struggle you'll have it's to fully understand and use the combat mode, while it's an action based combat, it also has a ""turn-gauge"" that will more likely be understandable as a ""action-meter"", that will be the turn clock so to speak. For those not familiar with such mechanism, it will take some time to comprehend but you'll get there.I truly recommend this game, it's really a great game and if I hade to rate it, I would give it an 9.0/10.0 ( the 1.0 taken is for the dialogues that could be a little more extensive/complex and for the fact that It could have been a huge story with so much potential, but they kept it on a safe level, which I respect but I like when developers take a leap of faith and expand their game universe ). BUY THIS GAME, You won't regret it.			",160,12,5,41,9,0,27

												Surprisingly ""okay"" game. The storyline is mundane and theres a lot of grinding to it, but it kills a lot of time. I feel like this game was just a game the developers put out really quickly because they were being pressed to come out with something. The game isnt bad, I mean it has potential. I just wish your character was a bit more customizable.			",17,1,0,3,0,0,1

												One of the best and most gripping narratives in a game I have ever experienced (not going to lie, there were many parts that made me teary eyed in a plot with so many twists and turns) and it came from a game I got for 19p. Even for 79p it is so much more than worth it.The battle system is simple but effective and has a nic little creative spin to it in the fact that the enemies can still attack you while you are chosing your move so you have to choose quickly.The game has over 10 hours of content with the main story alone and it has a satisfying ending that will leave you balling your eyes out.I would give this game a 10/10 but nothing is perfect although this game came pretty close.A solid 9/10 RPG			",33,10,1,3,6,1,12

												Loved loved loved this game! It took me a while to get used to the battle system. It's unusual in that you're not increasing your stats by getting new gear, and your ability to use a special move is extremely limited, so at first, it's a bit hack and slash until you level up and figure it out. There are side quests and puzzles, but the best part by far is the storyline. I even got a little teary eyed for a moment towards the end (and that's not an easy feat!). The characters are well fleshed out, the writing and dialogue is witty, and how the story all comes together is brilliant. I would love to see a sequel!			",9,11,0,8,1,0,0

												Really good story and good gameplay (not too easy but not frustratingly hard). Got it for like 50 cents but I would gladly pay a good few times more than that. The only inconvenience is that the game has a fair share of bugs (nothing too important), few misspellings and lacks a bit of a finishing touch (why isn't the path to the right of Azuma blocked if you can't go there? or maybe you can and I missed something)			",39,4,2,1,0,0,5

I dont know, I know that combat is limited for rpg maker, but something new could have been added to provide the player with an insentive to seek out fights anbd not run around them all like I did.

												I've played this game quite a bit before it's release and I really enjoyed it. The story is very interesting and has many optional side skits that help to flesh out the world of the game. The main characters receive some nice development along with some of the lesser side characters. The combat system might take some time to get acquanted with, but it is much more entertaining than others of this genre. There is even a neat cooking system to help support players throughout the game.  I would definitely recommend getting this game.			",104,19,0,25,16,0,13

												Let me start off by saying I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. I find it very difficult to find myself enraptured by games these days, outside of primarily the Souls series. So when I was browsing the store, the picture caught my eye, but as I read up on reviews for this I decided I wanted to try it out. Perhaps I would find something that would capture my attention the way every game used to when I was younger.Boy, was I right.I will be blunt. The story is not original, though that does not mean it isnt interesting. The art design is extremely familiar, given that many people will be reminded of their days playing pokemon. However, the intense combat learning curve (which at first feels like a wild rollercoaster ride with no safety harness, but then gradually turns into a race that challenges your reflexes) was incredibly stimulating. I also enjoyed a great portion of the dialogue. For example, (this is a generic encounter, in now way related to spoilerific content) there is a house in the main city that you can go into. Inside there is a gentleman. If you approach him and speak to him, the only thing he says is ""Get out of my house."" Its such a simple line, and yet I found myself laughing hysterically at the proposition of having a character give me such a realistic response in a game that is anything but. Remember all those houses you just randomly entered in pokemon to try and find stuff because you felt like it? How many times do you think youd be told ""Get out of my house"" in real life if you did the same thing? Its little things like that that turn something plain into something charming and captivating.The characters werent the most impressive bunch, but there were a few who stuck out as well thought out.This game isnt particularly great at anything, but the overall experience is.... satisfying, and endearing. Yes you may have to grind, but there are loops and tricks you can use to dramatically decrease the time spent grinding,if you're clever. Is it worth it? Absolutely.  10/10 would play again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, in the short amount of time I played it, had so many problems.Starting the game shows you one of the many problems: It's ugly. Everything is just so uninteresting and bland, and you expect me to be invested in what is happening? Honestly the first area looked like a sandbox. It was trying too hard to be Japanese and unfortunately it failed. Nothing felt genuinely like Japan, just a terrible imitation. It looked like some free sprites they give you in RPG Maker which I don't doubt they probably are.If only the problems ended there... We're soon introduced to our main character, Kenshi, because that isn't a generic name or something, and his annoying brother-cat Shinto. Let me tell you the biggest problem with Kenshi: HE IS A CLICHE, BORING CHARACTER. He repeats what we ALREADY KNOW and what makes it worse is he repeats it several times. Like, once is enough you don't need to tell me this. And Shinto is just so whiny and annoying, like you cannot expect me to like our protagonists when they're so bland and so irritating. If I see Shinto use the stupid anger tick mark one more damn time I'm honestly going to shoot myself.The character personalities are pretty bad, but at least they aren't as awful as the plot! I know I didn't play for too long but you're supposed to grasp the reader (Or in this case, player.) in the beginning of the story or else they'll quit because it's not worth it. And that's what happened this time, it wasn't worth it. It was so rushed and.. ""simple,"" which in this case isn't a compliment. It's like the generic demon plot was approaching us and the beginning full of its cliches showed us that. Get your cliche list out because this ""game"" uses a lot of them within the first 30 minutes of gameplay! Orphan, doesn't remember his parents, going on a journey to help his disabled brother, comically loves food despite appearing calm and collected, ends up in a place due and coincidently an incident happens and the law sees them as evil despite them helping and arrests them, outsider who appears poor has money for bail, outsider asks for favor and kickstarts their true journey... Really I could've added a lot more to that but it did a fantastic job at keeping up with the old tropes of a typical story like this! Like man I had no idea what happened when our protags ended up in jail for like, THREE MINUTES! I thought the game was over!!!And the battle system, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥did you have to make it real time? It did NOT work here AT ALL. THE SLOTH DEMONS ALMOST KILLED ME BECAUSE THEY CONSTANTLY SPAMMED THEIR SLEEPING SKILL, HOW IS THAT ""challenging""? No it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sometimes you miss like 5 ♥♥♥♥ing times in a row and oh♥♥♥♥♥♥you're dead sorry. :((( Jesus what an awful system, but I guess you needed something for your game to make it ""unique."" It's a damn shame you ♥♥♥♥ing failed because this game is awful. The cover art is awful, the video is awful, the game itself is awful, and in essence everything is awful. It isn't even worth a penny. And I'm genuinely convinced whoever enjoys this game hasn't read something that truly challenged the reader or played a ♥♥♥♥ing game in their entire life.			",9,4,0,2,3,0,1

												Took me about 12 hours to finish the game and didn't even find all the collectables and skits. Over all I really enjoyed the game. Very story heavy, very well written, the combat system was rather unique and fast passed the only ""negative"" if you could call it that, is the game uses default RPG Maker art assets which gives it a commonplace art style but overall would highly recommend.

												This isn't really even a game, it's a parody of a game. It is more like what I would expect from someone who was taking a course on RPG Maker and banged something out really quick as a homework assignment. It is a quaint little demo of some of the most basic things RPG maker is capable of. It is the software equivalent of plastic display food: you will see some things that will put you in mind of a RPG, but if you try to partake you will quickly realize there is no point. One of the only reasons I finished this thing was because of a constant nagging feeling of ""Surely there must be more to it than this?""Hit: passable story writing, lovely artwork in the steam store, sprint button, easily exploitable mechanics for circumventing the mind numbing combat, and thank god it was short.Miss: what little story the game has is stretched beyond reason and told poorly, excessive flashback sequences, sloppy coding, poorly designed (read:ABSENT) gameplay, only 11 types of enemies (including bosses) in the entire game, shallow characters, misleading promotional artwork, ubiquitous artificial game lengthening grind, and more boring than watching a robot play the original final fantasy in a language you can't read.I honestly am not even sure why this is on Steam. Do not ""play"" this ""game"" unless someone is paying you for your time.			",118,12,0,30,7,1,31

												There is no way in hell, this game deserves a positive review. I honestly do not know how there is any on here. I can only imagine they are paid, but if thats the case whoever made this game put more time into fake reviews than the game itself. The story, watery, predictable, and very simplistic. The dialog is an affront to man, conversations so cringe worthy it will make any nerd feel his inner bully come out and smack a ♥♥♥♥♥. The combat system is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Very straight forward, str agi blah blah all linear calculations. The dodge rate on monsters is absolutely ludicrous, over some 20%. Theres no actual gear, and no real reason to spend any in game gold you earn. Eventually you get your only use for the lazily made only in game mechanic there is, cooking recipes. At which point you find the ones that give you stats and... yeah just craft stats and make yourself invincible. Not to mention theres only 8 enemies in the whole freaking game, minus maybe the last boss. Just same sprites being used over and over, all exact same stats and everything too. Glitchy in many parts of the terain. Oh there isnt really much terrain either, about as much as the starting city in the first pokemon by a generous estimate. I could go on for a long time with whats wrong with this game. Basically, everything is. It probably isnt worth your time if it were a free game, DONT BOTHER BUYING THIS EVEN ON SALE.Theres a point in the game where you go into a ""memory"" so you start at lvl 1 again. This is important because theres an arbitrary save mechanic that keeps track of your save count. It looks important to some impact in the game, but its not. So I only had one save file because why would I need two for the worlds simplest RPG. Then you encounter what is essentially a level 20 mob when your level 1, and if you didnt stock on recovery items in the town and saved in the cave, you got trapped at this part in the game. Meaning you would have to restart the whole thing again if you wanted to finish it, just so you could get to the point where you could buy items and do the extra side quests in a dream zone thats made up to push the crappy story line.As a first attempt it might be an acceptable failure, but holy hell you got some balls trying to peddle this♥♥♥♥♥♥for money. Maybe not the worst game in the world but its certainly the worst ive ever bought.Doesnt steam prevent people from selling garbage like this? I thought there was a certain level of adequacy where it at least had to meet the criteria for a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the short review : at the time of this review the game is on sale for 98 cents and so far in the game i got lot more then i tought i would ( keeping in mind in spent 98 cents ) most rpgmaker would be done by now but im also just starting the game apparently so 2 bucks is worth it too imo the  longer review : overall classic jrpg story but they dont cut it short like most rpgmaker game do . its overall enjoyable and the dialoges did give me a small laught every now and then even tho they get cheesy by times . the story isnt too fleshed out and the few plot twist i came up too so far arent jaw droping but overall it kept me interested in what was up next the music was awesome in my opinion the character are sorta basic and not always the most interesting but the lines of dialoges who poped up every now and then basicly having them talk with each others where a nice touch that i welcomed everytime it poped up and it did give this game a big plus from me cause even tho they are basicish characters they have some nice interaction withg each others this way and its funny too read and if your not into that the devs made it optional ( the game prompts you to press q when one of those dialoges are available just dont press it if you dont care )gameplay was very basic on the overworld map but the fighting mechanic was pretty interesting in my opinion basicly turning the classic finalfantasy turn per turn fighting into ... with my very slight experience in jrpg something i could only describe as a semi turn per turn ...to better explain it your characters have a energy bar who reload itself after a few moments any action your characters take emptys the bar and you gotta wait for it to reload . to use a power you have a sp bar wich you charge by using basic attacks . both your basic attacks and your abilitys empty your energy bar when you use them . this goes the same way for your ennemies so they dont have too wait for you to use an action before using their own and you dont need to wait for your ennemies to use theire actions before using yours. also contrarely to final fantasy you can see the ennemies walking around on the overworld map so you can avoid fight or willingly run into them at willi liked this game alot because it gave me a feel of a old super nes final fantasy game before they turned too♥♥♥♥♥♥with final fantasy 7 ( i welcome any hate mail for this comment but i still think ff7 was♥♥♥♥♥♥compared too any super nes ff )			",78,7,0,19,6,0,2

												Pros:Decent musicCons:Technical problemsUnoriginal art style & aestheticSeems like a very generic game overallFirst of all i would like to say that i don't think this is a really bad game. But when you look at what it's about and how it runs, you just don't feel like it's a game worth your time. I personally found the story to be subpar at best, with an artstyle that's unoriginal to say the least. Some people may say that the artstyle is somewhat classic, but i do not share that train of thought. The best thing in this game for me, is the music. The music sounds decently pleasant and is actually not too bad. This is an RPG though, which means you are going to have to put a lot of time into it to get the the finish line. This means that the game needs to be even better then a lot of it's peers in other genres, since it has a lot to say, over a long period of time. So you need to almost play it through to get some kind of satisfaction when it comes to the story in particular. This game as i said in the beginning is not a really bad game at all. But since there are so many better games out there in the genre, i just can't find it in my heart to recommend you to use your money or your time on this game when you could have spent it on something better. If you would like to watch some gameplay of this game, you can check out my video of it below.Gameplay video:

												This game... what can be said?It is the most beautiful speciment available on Steam. Nay - this masterpiece not only spearheads its way through others of its kind, but it also beckoned brighter than a lighthouse in an otherwise sea of sub-par games. Although it was released in the distant past, January 2015, it has not only stood the test of time, but utterly demolished it. I personally spoke with the developer on multiple occasions in hopes to even capture a glimpse of the brilliance needed to produce such a masterpiece. Speaking with the person behind this was akin to what the apostles must have felt speaking to The One True Lord, Jesus Chistmas. The developer was so down to earth, yet belongs in the heavens, with this game. Ladies and gentlemen, I can say today that absolutes do exist. This game has proven that to me. I previously assumed that perfection was only a human construct; yet today, perfection was indeed constructed. I highly reccomend Sins Of The Demon RPG more than any game, NAY - anyTHING else in existance.			",40,2,0,9,5,1,5

												The idea of the game was great, but then it **** all over my hopes and dreams. The narritive is so simplistic that it hurts and the characters are so bland and boring. I played this alnoe and with a friend, and we both got bored quick. Monsters only know 1 attack and from what it seems, there are only 7. it was cute how they knew attacks based off the sin but thats as far as it goes. Monsters reset so the game becomes far too easy from exiting the area, going back and fighting again. This game has little to stand on. If this was a first time game then let me give some pointers.make more monsters with more spells and attacks, its not hard.give the characters more personality then just their intrests. work on the narritive, its almost painful to read.make the combat more exicting then just tapping attack.I give this game a 1/10the only reason it gets a 1 is because the Idea of this game was good. I wish I got a refund but I was too late and gave this game too many chances.			",10,4,0,2,0,0,0

I greatly enjoyed it, the characters are extremely well done, we got twists and turns, most of which involve your currently played character falling in love with the girl you just met that day. The whole every other girl romance thing is my only actual complaint. This game's story is absolutley amazing, it's been so long since I've fully played through a game all the way, even a game I greatly enjoy, so props			",295,55,0,46,8,1,15

												The story is not my cup of tea, though it is ok.I also don't like to grind.It's an okay game that I saw dev put some good effort into it. Normally, it would be a thumb up.However, it is not outstanding and lives to expecation. The characters of protagonists are decent. However, their type are very generic.Maybe we all are shallow emotional creatures, but I'm not enjoy a bit of staying like that.Dig it deeper than emotions.The marketing of this game is horrible.If dev wanted to make a soft porn, then they should do it. However, they did not.If dev wanted to make a game with a good story, please do not use big-boob-female as cover.This game doesn't sell its strong point. In a way, it lets down both consumers who look for boobs and those who look for story.Not because of quality but because of expectation.			",34,23,0,26,16,0,26

												NOTE: This game has been giften to me by EQ Free Games during the alpha phase of the game for the purpose of spreading the joy of this game when I enjoyed it. And guess what:It's a pretty awesome game.Before you start blaming on the RPG Editor graphics, let me explain first. When I started playing the game, I didn't expect too much from it. But since I received the game as a gift, I thought I would give it a try. I had the same feeling like you would have right now at the first few minutes of the game, but I decided to continue playing.And I'm glad I did.This is not just a ''simple RPG created in an editor to make some easy money'', although the graphics might express that. But the looks of the game are misleading, because the true potential of this game lies deeper: The story.The story of Kenshi and his demon cat is told in such a good way, with plot-twists and jokes in all corners of the game. There is just so much dialog put into these lovely characters that you know that this RPG isn't something made to exploit you, but to enjoy you, to make you laugh, to make you cry, but most important: to let you have a good time. And that's a big plus for me.Of course, story isn't everything. Apart from the story, the rest of the game is pretty ''okay'' in the sense that it isn't perfect, but it does the job. For exemple, the combat system is pretty cool with all the different classes you find during the game, but it's pretty basic (apart from the fact it's a semi-real time combat system). So are the graphics and the exploration. It's not perfect, but it still creates the atmosphere needed for a nice RPG like this.To summarise my review: This RPG is pretty basic in a lot of aspects, but the story is beyond extraordinary. And I think that is the most enjoyable aspect of this game and a RPG in general. It just helps to fill the atmosphere so much. The rest of the game definitely has potential to be improved here and there (the devs work on it.), but in its current state it's still one of the best games I played in a while, especially for this price.Score: 7.9/10			",56,9,2,2,1,0,10

												Sins of the Demon RPG. A RPG maker game that I definantly did enjoy and was a good price for a short fun game. The story is pretty simple. In the world of Lanistra a demon (being naturaly evil) cursed the world before being snuffed out by princess Asuki. That anyone who really really commits to a sin, becomes that corrusponding demon. Lust, Greed, Gluttony, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Sloth. The world is now just coverd with these once human. now demons and they find and attack you pretty dilagently through out the game.SO. You play as Kenshi, a demonhunter swordsman and his brother Shinto, a demon cat... Yes and then you pretty much get the story and idea that like Full Metal Alchamist you are  to try to find a way to return Shinto from demon cat to human. Travel from town to town, searching for this cure while killing baddies demons and helping citizens out with a pretty comic routine bewteen the two brothers. Kinda of a modern Marvel comic, kid friendly jokes and hi-jinks. The game music is a little generic for RPG maker games and isnt the most uplifting upbeat for this type of game. There is also just 2 characters you play as instead of the get 5 friends or a huge party to advance through the game. Diffrent yes, not bad and there is no gear. NO weapons or armor to upgrade or sell/trade/find. Witch I look forward to in my RPG game. Again, not bad just diffrent, because the items and such deal more with the real gimick of the game. COOKING. yes, all food network fans will love this part. Find recipes and food like items to create meals in the crafting part of this game. The food gives you buffs, health and such and are made when you find the right kitchens around the game. Kenshi in game loves and talks and yes food and cooking is an interesting part of the game. Witch is fun and keeps the game different. Grab it and play. ! cook and kill ! oh and change your bro back into a human...			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												It's a pretty good gameIt has a lot of bad points (like when you miss 3/4 hit durings fight, when the dialogues long a bit too long, the fact that you can't change the controls (the arrows aren't very good, it's generaly better with wasd. But If you have a controler, that it solve that problem) and maybe a lack of achivements for me(I mean there are too much achivements you can't get to far in the game)) but honetly for the price is really worth it.It's has a funny and pretty long stroy, except the thing I mentioned earlier the fights are pretty good.

Wouldn't say the storyline's fantastic or out of this world but it was great enough to capture my attention throughout the game & made me emotional at the end (totally not spoiling XD). The only thing i would complain about is its combat system, it's all about fighting against time and how fast you gotta act before your opponent eventually lands an attack on you. Overall, it's a game worth its price!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-constypical RPG dead parents included. not a fan of the pressing Q system (would prefer it to be C) or the semi-turn based combat - perhaps i would prefer it if the heroine was not so squishy, if it was turn based or if this was an action game instead of story driven. boss fights were a bit hard and money hard to come by towards the end even with the side quests-pro'svery story driven (linier) which is nice for a relaxed seshion. well written (often brought out my emotions, most games dont, but it may be the pills im on) with an excellent story (pretty deep and hits on some good phylosophical concepts at the start, hit the feels throughout the rest of the story) and well made, no bugs encountered. beautiful music choise and love the asthetics. its pretty damn cute having a talking cat too. Overall an excellent game that was pulled together very well, would highly reccomend if you enjoy story driven games with a bit of action and some challenge ocasionally			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved this game soooo much! It has a very good story and good if not at least okey charecters, it kinda had a feeling of a good story you may see in an anime so to speak. it had romance, comedy, suspence and so much more. The gameplay is active meaning its going to test your quick stratigy over planning your next move so be sure to resurch your stats and skills before fighting. you will expiriance some grind in the begining but it getts easierish as you go more into the story. over all the game mechanics are that of final fantisy but the story is its own and I loved it. Pros:-nice intresting story-good balance of easy and hard for the most part-intresting side quests-A nice amount of stuff to explore and discover-Loveable charecters!Cons:-May be somewhat hard in the very start-May need to grind a little as the enamies get harder very quick at some point-Your gonna fight many monsters for money many times So over all if you're ok will a little grinding than the game is worth it!

												Eng & Ru---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eng: I can safely say that the game is worth the money. The story is pretty good, though a little jaded. Making a music (especially the main theme of the game all the pleasant to the ear ^ _ ^) and graphically sustained good! Also, easy cards and badge. =)P.s: Game for those who like RPG Maker games and jRPG games as well.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ru: Смело могу сказать что игра стоит своих денег. Сюжет довольно неплох хоть и немного заезжен. Оформление как музыкальное( особенно музыкальное - главная тема игры весь приятна для слуха ^_^ ) так и графически выдержана неплохо! Также лёгкие карточки и значёк. =)P.s: Игра для тех кому нравяться игры с RPG Maker и японские ролёвки в частности.			",194,41,1,56,5,0,21

												Good rpg maker game. It did lack a variety of monsters to fight but the story was one of the better ones I have seen on an rpg maker game. Pretty simple turn based old fashioned rpg.			",456,166,4,72,34,6,50

												It's a pretty good gameIt has a lot of bad points (like when you miss 3/4 hit durings fight, when the dialogues long a bit too long, the fact that you can't change the controls (the arrows aren't very good, it's generaly better with wasd. But If you have a controler, that it solve that problem) and maybe a lack of achivements for me(I mean there are too much achivements you can't get to far in the game)) but honetly for the price is really worth it.It's has a funny and pretty long stroy, except the thing I mentioned earlier the fights are pretty good. So I enjoy this game.			",14,2,0,2,1,0,1

												seriously, i never thought this game would be this good! at first i dont like the battle system, but eventually i get used to it. besides, the story, the jokes, the character's personality, mapping, music are super interesting and relaxing!if you like rpg maker games that:- simple (no customization, but you can cook to upgrade status and HP)- story rich- won't make you feel stressed out because the boss is too strong- tricky- no need to grinding levels / money- has a pink badge (lv1) XDthen i 100% reccomend this. worth your cents, worth your 10+ hrs.

												I LOVE THIS GAME SOOOO MUCH! When I first got it, it was 49 cents and I didnt think I would get much out of it but I figured ill try it because I love these types of games.It suprised me how well made this game is! The story line is really deep and it honestly made me feel really sad almost cry at points. There is so many side quest that you can do that even have stories behind them which makes this game so much better. As of now I have 9hrs on it and I haven't yet completed it but so far its been the best 9hrs of my life, personally I think if this was an ANIME it would do great.I do wish it was more popular because this game really deserve more players. Personally I reccomend it for anyone who likes these types of games!			",122,40,4,16,9,1,11

												If you're actually a major fan of Aveyond series (Mainly old Aveyond series, hi! ) / RPG / RPG XV, you should actually try this out.Poor quality as it may seem, this actually have a good plot, interesting characters and fun story with a lot of cute side quest.Romance, Comedy, Adventure, Tragedy-Oh yes, have we forgotten about boobs? We all come to this game for boobs anyway.#AllHailOppaiMonster can be hard to kill after meeting God of Discord aka Isharul, but then again we all are plainly aiming for God of Lust- Oh maybe just me.Eitherway, worth the play. 9/10 recommend for rpg players.

												I bought this game in a pack that came with multiple games, and i don't regret it, but that's because i Love Rpg games to death.If you don't really like Rpg tittles, refrain yourself from buying this game, unless you can deal with what i'm about to say.First of all, the story is quite interesting in fact. And the enemies and bosses are well designed, the map is vast and there are a few party members to go after.The problem is the Skill system in my opnion.In battle, you will have Skills for each character that you can use, and using a skill costs skill points, much Like Magic Wastes Mana in Final fantasy games, and that's where lies the issue.I find myself using just fight for each character when the skill points run out, which is usually 1/2 skills depending on the character. And each attack recovers 10 Skill Points, so, you have to attack 5 times per character to make each one be able to use their most simple skills. In games with magic points, this rarely happens, since there are multiple types of magic, with multiple spells and a lot of mana.And another thing that lacks is the inexistance of unique tabs for each character.For example, in other games, each character has their unique tab to use, for example : ""Jump"" , or ""Charge"", meaning that JUST THAT CHARACTER can use those abilities. This Rpg lacks that.But this can be easily fixed in Save points. Every time you save, you recharge everything , so that's a plus.I do reccomend the game, and I like it, the writing is Superb, Props to whoever wrote the lines for the characters, they make quite the show with the feeling of adventure of a saturday morning Cartoon.So, Is this game good? Should I get it?- Yes. Definitely, i think you'll like it. Specially in Sale time, since you will have a good time.But if you're not a Jrpg Fan, refrain from buying it. The game brings Nothing new to the table, except for the cooking system, which i found interesting.But it does present everything in a particularly interesting manner, and i think you guys would enjoy it!
