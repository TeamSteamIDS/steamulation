												+ Simple and fun gameplay which is easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.+ Very skill-based and competitive. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.+ Tolerable community. Most of the time they show sportsmanship and are very fair.+ Lots of community created content. Also includes the Steam Workshop.+ User friendly track, car and replay editors to create said content.+ Great car physics.- Ubisoft decided it'd be a good idea to split the TM² environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. The result? Less players, less servers. You won't have a problem though until you hit 60k ladderpoints - that's when you have to play on different servers to gain more. And those servers are rather dead.- Said car physics tend to mess up sometimes, but that's usually the map builder's fault.- 5min cooldown on official races is a bit too long. In fact, why do they even make you wait? You could simply pay with Coppers (the currency) in previous games to try again, however, this doesn't work here. So this makes it really tedious to get good times on official races.- The price tag. TMNF was free, while this is $10, even though it's pretty much the same game.TrackMania² Stadium is an updated version of TMNF, ported to the updated engine with ManiaPlanet. It's great, but I wouldn't recommend picking it up at its full price.8/10 ",582,79,29,50,49,3,30

												This game is pretty ridiculous. It's like the company asked a bunch of 4th graders to come up with ideas for a racing game, and this is the result. Wall rides, loops, huge jumps, crazy speed. It's awesome.That being said, the skill cap is infinitely high. Yes, it's massively fun to go on a server and smash through a bunch of new tracks, crashing all over the place and hitting walls like they owe you money. And it's worth mentioning that since the multiplayer is almost exclusively user-created levels, there are tens of thousands of maps to play. But once you settle in to a server and have learned the maps, then it becomes a wonderfully technical game about shaving off bits of time where you can.A notable game mechanic, for those unaware, is that in time attack mode (probably the most popular game type, that and Rounds) you can reset to the beginning of the track (or the last checkpoint) at any time. This is a bit of departure from many other racing games. You'll just have a set amount of time (usually 5 to 7 minutes), to get a single best run possible. This makes it so that you never have to waste time finishing a run when you've already messed up, you can just reset and start fresh immediately. Makes for a much more efficient practice regimen, and resulting rate of improvement.There are three environments within TrackMania 2 (Stadium, Valley, Canyon), but within each environment is an abundance of variety in itself. Since this review is Stadium, I'll focus on that briefly:-Track materials: Pavement, Dirt, Grass, Water-Game Modes: Time Attack, Rounds. Probably others, but rarely used. RPG, I suppose.-Track Types: FullSpeed (because braking is for losers), Tech (because fullspeed is for neanderthals), Dirt (because you are full of self-loathing), Speedtech (Because you're a well-balanced individual with many friends and a winning smile).Seriously, the infinite permutations of tracks alone makes this game worth it.The End			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Addictive. Surprisingly addictive. I bought this expecting 5 hours max of gameplay. I would drive around in my car a little bit, crash into some wall, then go. Honestly, looking at the name and trailers, I wasn't really expecting a great game. I was so wrong. This game is great. The tracks, the concept, the art, even the music. Everything about this game was done right.  The levels aren't repetative so you won't get lulled into a bored repetitive leveling. No, each level has its own new quirck and obviously a new track. If you are going to buy this, be prepared to start honing your keyboard driving skills because this fast-paced game will require skill. But skill that you won't mind training for because it is such a fun game.			",110,14,4,11,27,2,8

												I started playing the Trackmania series back in 2009, By the time i got my 1st gold medal, i knew it was one of my all-time favourite games. Instead of choosing a set car or track, Nadeo lets the players create their own experiences, with multiple creation tools such as creating a track or painting a car. Trackmania is a very competitive game, most racing will be decided by 1 or 2 milliseconds. Trackmania is not about who has the best car, its about who is the best racer. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the best racing games i have ever played.			",164,8,25,9,9,1,31

												My most favorite and most played game of all time spending over 2000 hrs on Trackmania Nations, some more thousand on Trackmania United and also on the Forever expansion for both of those games. I have a long history with this game and it will always be in m heart. The developers are cool guys and ive had the honor to meet them on several occations, including their 10 year anniversary at the Ubisoft HQ where we, the invited, played against the developers where we crushed them.I can't say more about the game itself because I straight up ♥♥♥♥ing love it. Especially the tools. ..and also the gameplay. Trackmania 2 Stadium doesn't do much new other than upgrading the engine, adding a few new block types and upgrading the mediatracker. The single player by Papychampy is probably the best campaing they have made. The gameplay is still the same, (which is good though) but has a constant flow of new maps every day to keep it entertaining. This is the reason why I can still jump into the game and play some maps, 9 years later. Though since the original (and expansion) was free, I have no problem paying for this game. Sadly the game isnt what it used to be, because a lot of the core community players have fallen off the rails. This game was fun because of the community. People made a lot and was very creative. You could join clans just to have fun, which made me play it for at least 6 hrs a day back in 2006. My one reccomendation doesnt justify how much this game is to me. ",124,13,6,10,16,0,8

												The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Stadium, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 90 and 190. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.

												TrackMania Stadium is a solid high-speed multiplayer racing game that puts you against the clock with other players across the world simultaneously. TrackMania is a game about precision. If you are looking for a racing game with crashes and power-ups, this is not for you. TMS has a large surplus of maps with various difficulties. Almost every track involve a very large amount of skill to pull of fast times. TMS has a single-player mode and it's pretty basic. You competing against yourself to get bronze, silver or gold medals. The single-player is here to enhance your ability to do better on courses and to make you even better at the game. The money is well spent when you play multiplayer.There are a ton of servers that are up across the world. All ranging from U.S. to Germany to Japan. I was amazed by how the servers ran, even with over 50 people. Obviously, this was needed as this type of game relies on time based racing. It's exhilerating to go at a such high speed and making perfect turns as you barely beat the opponent who is ahead of you. You actually feel like you are going extremely fast and it makes the game challenging and pretty addicting at certain times. The graphics in TMS aren't amazing compared to TrackMania Valley, but they get the job done as well as the audio. The controls aren't totally perfect, but they're responsive enough to give you a chance of making some really good times.I'm not that great at the game, but these last 7 hours have improved me as a player and I can only learn from the professionals around me. PROS:+High Speed Time Trials+Great Amount of Tracks+Solid Controls+Good Community with a large surplus of servers+Decent Price+Excellent Frame-rate with very rare connection issues+Skill BasedCONS:-Can get tedious on occasion While I only have one con, that bullet is very important. I rarely find myself playing TMS for more than an hour on any given time which isn't that great of a thing. Although, TMS is a solid game nonetheless.

												Trackmania 2 Stadium is a casual arcade racing game,like the Trackmania 1 series before it,it has a massive online following of players and modders,online leaderboards for country and region and an unlimited amount of tracks to race on,Trackmania 2 series is more of an updated version of the original game with a new graphics and sound engine,a more streamlined interface geared towards simplified ingame downloadable content and trying to combine the other expansions of the trackmania series together.The old Trackmania games could be purchased as several different themes,sunshine,nations,united and forever,these were separate games with the same racing only set in different locals and racing car types,like F1 rally,exotic.There are also a few other versions on the game that combined everything together as one purchase called united nations.The original is old,it's pricing structure and layout was a mess but the game was very good in it's own right however it would never be recommended over the Trackmania 2 series these days.Trackmania 2,so for the new updated game,it has now been split into three games,Stadium,Canyon and Valley -F1-STOCK-RALLY each of these games have their own locale and racing style,each of these games are superb in their own way and now these three games are tied together with the new menu system.The gameplay is very arcade,these games use for example the rally theme in a very loose sense to make up the look and sound of the game but overall,all three games are of the Trackmania style of gameplay,a gameplay all on it's own.Gameplay consists of racing without racing !,you racing on the games tracks or the user created tracks that can resemble something from FZero or Micromachines or Hotwheels,you race simply for the race record and you race against your own and everyone else's ghost car,when you play online you are also racing against online players ghost cars,they are playing in real time but you can't crash into them as there is no collision,if there were collision then the game would simply not work as you can be racing along side as many as 400 other players at the same time of any given track !This is a very casual pick up and play,have fun and turn off again game but it's also a very skillful game,also a very exciting game that looks and sounds great to boot,it doesn't matter what version of the game you buy,stadium canyon and valley all offer the same level of skill and fun.So I would recommend everyone play this game,it's the PC racing game that everyone should own a copy of,I will break down the differences of each of the three games in preference as my opinion below.Trackmania Stadium -You can't go wrong with stadium as it's the base game,the original and the best and has a f1 style car,and roads and track set similar to something like hot wheels and fzero,good traction on the road see's your car doing loop the loops and crazy wallrides,a very fast game and the number one choice over the other two.Trackmania Canyon -The weakest of the three but it's really really fun,as good as the others but just not the best,however there is a certain amount of skill involved with canyon that pushes it further than vally and stadium,handling is similar to ridge racer making for very fast laptimes and the official trackmania contest finalists play canyon over the other two,i can understand why ! Trackmania Valley - the best looking of the three as it's engine was tweaked as the locale has more going on,more detail and simply just amazing looking ! Valley is the middle ground of the TM games,it feels more like stadium with more traction on the road,but ultra fast like canyon but doesn't offer anything really different apart from being an all round great game,however there are some other things about valley that do stand out and that's in it's level track design,the editor has a little more scope for making day and night time tracks,forrest tracks and underground tracks that can have you driving through mountains,i would say it's the middle ground and having all the of the best features of the two before it you would think it's the best of the bunch but it just isn't ! not a thing wrong with it but it still can't beat stadium. I would always recommend Stadium as the starting game,it's the cheapest of the three and the core game is there,the other two are just as good but I would say Stadium is the best of the three,with stadium you do not even need to ever play the other two games,the other two are for those who can't get enough of the Trackmania series and it's also good to change out every now and then for something s bit different to race on.CONSThe game like soo many others are not without problems,many bugs have already been sorted but I found the Trackmania series in particular to have some very backwards design ideas/flaws,for the most part this game and it's expansions will run 60fps+ on the very high graphical settings,some settings still slow it down like motionblur but thankfully you can turn all details from off,low,med,high,the vsync options are not very well explained as there are six options for vsync as well as triple buffering and first time users won't know the correct/best setup,I will say now that you should use vsync,also use every third frame (not constant frame) and also use triple buffer and this should give you a proper 60fps,water shader detail for medium pc's should be med or low,and motion blur would be recommended as off,there are many other options in the start up menu and you should take the time in setting these up,resolution is very important in this game,i found that lower resolutions are fine but you really miss the graphical details so I would recommend you aim for 1080,full frame rate with vsync options and then turn up other details to see what you can get away with.Other problems with the game are the lack of support,this game is made by a French company and the forums and users are mostly EU users,there's not as many users from the uk and usa on the forums,that doesn't mean there are not many users from uk and usa playing the game,just means we try to avoid the unhelpful forums as I found I didn't get anywhere when asking for help.The game's layout,the way the game works can be quite strange as well,you earn points for scoring high,these points are called Planets ? your planets are displayed in the top bar when you are in the main menu,these Planets are then used to buy online user created content,you earn a little planets each day that you play as well,another thing that seems backward to me is the apparent new menu system that combines everything together (it doesn't actually work) after all the time this game has been out it still is broken but since an update a month ago it is now working outside of steam but the steam version is still unworking,this means that if you own two or more of the trackmania games,you need to exit out the game and start then other one up from steam ( not a big deal really)Overall this game is amazing,be prepared to spend some time on the game,take your time and mess about in the menus and try to get used to the way the Trackmania system works,playing the game for the first time gave me the feeling of (wtf have I just bought ?) it took me a while to understand the games charm,I was expecting far too much from the game and when I couldn't really GET the concept of the game along with the many problems I faced in trying to find out what Planets are and why my planets would disappear without buying content or sometimes I would buy content and lose my planets but not receive my item,I found it very hard in finding the answers on google or the mania forums,little things like this can really put you off a strange game and concept like this one,but give it a go and you will find it hard not to fall in love with this game,it's a classic reborn and in my opinion one of the best hardcore/arcade racers you can get !10/10			",336,111,30,45,20,2,47

""5 reasons why 'Celebrat10n TrackMania2 Pack' is a disappointment!""#1 Limited edition Modding:  Anthodev [developer]; ""Do you know that TM Unlimiter is abandonned on Trackmania² because we have developed our own TM-Unlimiter like tool in Maniaplanet available to the players?

												It's hard to review a game like this...The product's quality is astonishing.Perfect game, perfect graphics, perfect online, perfect editor.The only issue is that, this package, is mostly similar to the ""Trackmania Nations Forever"" one, which is free, or to the ""Stadium"" mode of ""Trackmania United Forever"".So if you're a new fan of the trackmania universe buy this game right away, but if you already play on the Stadium (standard) or Nations packages, you might avoid buying this one (Though i still recommend getting it, if you have the money).I hafve to say that this package adds some brand new cool blocks to the editor and Nadeo's tracks are something amazing!For the first time playing the single player really is an enjoable experience aswell.I recommend the game.

												If you are one of the many who picked up Trackmania Nations Forever for free, you'll instantly recognise this title. It plays just the same, very easy controls, very difficult to master, and almost impossible to put down. Graphically it's far superior to the original (hardly surprising) although with everything moving so fast it's difficult to really spot a lot of the graphical improvements, apart from those on the car itself. Well worth the fiver it costs, even though Trackmania Nations Forever is free. I'd recommend downloading the original game, treating it is a demo, and if you like that, you'll consider this an essential purchase.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												i have to say, i'm biased, this game strikes an emotional chord with me. im really into cars and racing. it's 11/10, the best arcade racer i have ever played.this game requires a gamepad. srsly dont use a keyboard you'll break it. i use a wired xbox 360 conroller.with that, the main thing about this game is it's gameplay. it is extremely difficult. this is not an easy game to be good at. lap time is king. you will be timed from when you exit the gate to when you have driven through all  checckpoints. you will see other players knock in times at the top of leaderboards that you'll scratch your head and say ""how in the world did they do that?"" this game requires a lot of practice and a lot of crashing into walls to become proficient. at the time of this review, i have 230 hours in trackmania 2 but that is not representative of my skill. i have over 1000 hours in the game before this one, Trackmania Nations Forever. I am an elite player in the north american scene, but i practice mainly on French servers. why, you ask?the community for this game is focused where real life motor racing is king: europe. I practice in the French scene because the French dirt scene fits my style of play: fast paced, high slip angle rallying with tons of ridiculously difficult jumps. you have to flip through the servers to find a group of maps and people that fit your style of play, and that takes a couple hundred hours.i want to say: its worth it. if you take the time to become good at drifting at all speeds (at least 500 hours for me) then you will discover a deep, involving gameplay experience that sucks you in and begs you to take that corner just a little bit faster, to drift harder, to look down the road and wonder, ""how fast can i REALLY go?"" ""can i make the bonus jump this time, or will i settle for the regular jump? i need 200 more KPH!""that is why i love this game. i hope you will too.			",66,2,9,0,0,0,2

												Trackmania² Stadium is a game with endless posibilities. you can build your own tracks so the game will never get boring.the playerbase is not that big, but there are always a solid 200 people online and i don't see it dropping very soon.The graphics aren't the greatest but the gameplay totally makes up for it. And the best of all is: You don't have to be a pro-gamer to have fun with it, you can always try to beat your own records instead of going for the #1 spot, with local and dedimania records. Alot of servers also have custom music playing, which is pretty cool! The community is also very friendly, you hardly find people insulting eachother. Which is pretty rare these days.for $9,99 the game is very well worth it.Graphics: 7,5/10Replay value: 9,5/10gameplay fun: 9,5/10optimalization: 9/10audio: 7/10Community: 9/10price/worth: 10/10Total: 9,5/10This is actually my first review ever on Steam.

												For anyone unfamiliar with Trackmania, here's a quick overview:- Tracks are built out of prefab pieces, kinda like lego (but obviously with race track shapes instead of rectangles).- Cars cannot collide with other cars.  You cannot run other players off the road in this game.- In multiplayer, you're in a simultaneous time-trial competition with the other players, but sometimes there are other goals... such as simply being able to finish a very difficult track or a specially crafted stunt-oriented track at all.Generally speaking, this is a game for perfectionists, speed seekers, and stunt lovers.The main benefit of this game over other racing games is that you can jump into an already-running multiplayer server at random, encounter new tracks that you've never seen before as well as ones you've mastered, and have people to compete with, pretty much any time you want.

												This game will yield hours and hours of fun. I shouldn't be so quick to call it a game though; It's more of a sport. There are few controls other than stop, go, turn, and restart, but don't think for a second that there is no room for improvement. The game engine catches every slight turn of the wheel for split second victories or losses. The community is great too; there are countless custom tracks that refuse to let this game become stale. WELL worth the price.			",66,29,1,12,4,0,5

												If you like TMUF, you're gonna like this... it's pretty much the same only upgraded graphics and new car sounds (and yes, a few new blocks if you like building tracks).This is still hands down, the best, most competitive racing game on PC, and probably on all platforms.Easy to learn, very hard to master. Good for casual racers, good for competitive players... everyone gets what he/she wants.Only downside for me is the fact that the publisher does not at all push this game as an e-sport, while it is still played at most LAN's and e-sport events... and the playerbase is pretty huge for a racing game. The potential is there to be much larger, but unfortunatly Nadeo/ubisoft does not seem interested...Other then that, great game, great tournaments, great community.I've been playing Trackmania pretty much since it came out, about 10 years ago, and still play its almost every day :)			",84,9,4,6,10,2,4

												I never really got into the Trackmania series... A friend of mine made me buy it years ago (he loves it). I didn't like racing with keyboard, I disliked the casual arcade style, I disliked the very short races.  I found a whole bunch of things to dislike and noted them in order of priority (that list has been lost now, perhaps thrown away inadvertently).  2015 is drawing to an end, and having recently purchased an Oculus DK2: I downloaded the demo of Trackmania Stadium.  I can tell you that Trackmania with Oculus is a whole new experience! The graphics are beautiful in stereoscopic 3d. The visuals are very sharp, beautifully lit and it all looks very real. Not even the slightest hint of judder (running in extended mode 6.0.1. runtime windows 8, Nvidia 680).I think HMD VR has the unique ability of being able to reveal to you the beauty of a particular game you couldn't fully appreciate without it. When playing games the conventional way through a TV or monitor - you're seeing that game world from a distance (through a small window). With VR you are projected into that world - everything is life size. You tend to notice things and feel immersed to a degree not possible even with the best 4k monitor or large screen TV.  Control-wise it's nice to see Trackmania automatically detect my Saitek X52 Pro so I can use the joystick for racing (I haven't had to configure anything!). Much nicer than key-presses.Racing in 3rd person with Oculus is mind-blowing (3rd person was also on my dislike list in the past).  You get to see all of the detail in the game and the tracks are jaw-dropping. I find myself looking up at the sky or at the intricate scenery. I would say this is one of the best VR experiences you can have.  In an instant I have converted from someone who didn't like the game (previous versions), to someone who thinks it's stunning and hopes Nadeo convert their entire series to VR. Yes, for every Trackmania game released with VR support: I will buy and recommend to others.Trackmania is a great example of a game that reveals its true beauty through VR...Nadeo should be very proud of this creation.

												Definitely not the game I thought it was. I knew it was whacky but found out there was a bit of seriousness behind the scenes. Watching the previews I got the sense it would be similar to HotWheels Turbo Racing in which players were able to maneuver the cars in mid-air. This is not the case here; you'll need to time and calculate your speed, angle and take-off.The gameplay within this game is pretty rock solid. Although simplistic in nature, the game delivers a solid driving experience. The steering is tight but feels closely to the stiffness of an F1 car. The acceleration feels like you're speeding up and gaining momentum. Complete the former two with outlandish tracks with extremely tight and fun turns makes it almost into a complete game. The career mode in this is a bit odd. It seems as though the game was meant to be played online but can provide just as much fun offline. The only catch here is you're not really racing. You are, but you're not. Most of the career races involve time attacks. There are races which are lapped but for the most part it's time attack. Some gamers may find racing by yourself is a bit of a nuisance, even for single player mode. Again, online there can be multiple people on the track at the same time but in time attack, you'll be racing a ghost. Completing each race challenge results in attaining either a bronze, silver or gold card depending on your performance. The game is good enough that single player does not feel like a grind (in my opinion). Record breaking times are kept for each individual track and gives the player a ghost to play against.To maximize time and acceleration, it's best to try and keep straight and avoid jumps. This will be unavoidable as the tracks go from a linear build to some extremely crazy turns and loops. The race starts in a straight line. Then some turns will be thrown in. Next thing you know you're driving sideways then into a loop-to-loop. One thing to note is that when you drive through a loop, it switches to first person view. This may drive some nuts as a quick view switch is sort of unexpected. The tracks themselves can change from concrete, to grass or to gravel/dirt (which significantly effects turning controls). I find for most turns simply letting go of acceleration can work but there are cases where you'll need to specify which brake type to use. The hard brake slide/stop will bring your car quickly to a halt for sharp turns while the hand brake will allow you to maintain speed while sliding. Additionally, being in the air can cause quite some complications. If taking off isn't done right, sometimes the car won't land properly or spin out of control. There is an ""air-brake"" sort of feature in which you need to hold acceleration but tap the brake button in the air. Doing this tries to halt your movement. If you take a jump poorly, most likely you'll end up with poor results.What isn't advertised is the fact that (I'm assuming all) Trackmania is local co-op. There is an option for local play which can include up to four players. The players are sort of limited in choice regarding game mode. The only mode available is ""round"" in which the first player across the finish line wins. On top of this, if you do manage to complete all the courses and do get tired of local and multiplayer, the devs have been kind enough to include a solid track editor into the game. Want an entire track full of loops? Go ahead and go nuts. Just be aware that the cars need enough acceleration to make it through certain points! Adding a speed boost can definitely help reduce free-falls. A helpful tip to a possible future game would be to not fight against the games physics. The ""A"" button on a 360 controller holds the car steady in mid-air. Don't get your landing angle right and face the consequences. Also, drift is sort of possible in dirt. The graphics are pretty good for a game with a bit of age. Everything seems to have a nice polish and colors mesh nicely together. Not to mention, the back drop of being in a giant stadium is neat. The only thing that's extremely bothersome for me is not being able to see the nose of the F1 car in first person view. Sounds are generic and are decent. There isn't much to talk about here either than the sounds play/change at the right times (when you change track from concrete to grass) and the engine sounds are decent.Overall, it's a decent game for what it is, an outlandish track game. It's not exactly a racing game per se, but it will give any racing fan something to play.RATING : 7.1/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots : Even for a dated game, the visuals are still nice There are a lot of obstacles to go over, under and through Racing a ghost Lovely view Look well through the menus for local play Course selection screen ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Trackmania is the most fun I've ever had playing a game in a LAN environment. It is multiplayer time trials. Everybody is racing at the same time, for the best time. You cannot directly interact with the other cars but you can see them and you are competing with them. Most tracks are only about 30 seconds long and you get about 5 minutes to get the best time possible. All the while you know how well your competitors are doing and see them racing besides you. It is a very intense and fun experience.Trackmania 2 Stadium is the direct sequel to Trackmania Nations Forever and includes an updated engine with much better graphic, a nicer user interface, better multiplayer, more tracks, and a more active community. It is all about speed and crazy tracks with loops and fast curves.The other Trackmania 2 games, Canyon and Valley, feature different environments. Canyon is more on-road racing with wider tracks in a beautiful desert environment. Canyon also includes nicer-looking cars which show damage when you hit things. Valley, which I have not yet played, features more off-road driving. All games have the capabilities to create your own tracks or download pre-made tracks from the Internet.I recommend starting with Trackmania 2: Stadium as it is the cheapest and most popular environment. Trackmania Nations Forever is free on Steam if you want to try out the original.			",448,132,27,81,60,6,125

												The price you're going to pay will be for the service of Maniaplanet that offers you editor plugins, import of custom blocks, creation of title packs, monthly updates etc. that weren't available in the free version.So if you're going to use any of those services, the price will be worth, otherwise you will waste money to be in a version less crowded than the free version.Note that TMN ESWC servers are still open and that if you want to play TMN Forever without FreeZone you need to buy TMU Forever for 30 €.As some reviews, this is for the fans of the serie, if you only enjoy driving on your own maps, keep playing on the free version.

When racing is turned into acrobaticsTrackMania² Stadium has to be one of the better racing games that is out there. Not because of the simulation like mechanics but rather because of its unrealistic gameplay.TrackMania² Stadium is all about going fast and driving through different kinds of tracks ranging from Acrobatic tracks to more classic Endurance type of tracks. There's quite some variety with the built in tracks that the game comes with. Each and every track feels unique and doesn't really use any old mechanics or tricks from previous tracks. You can clearly see thought was put into making the tracks for the base game. All the different track types usually have a couple of trick that you need to learn in order to master them and get the fastest time which adds a lot of replayability to the game. You most likely won't succeed with your first try on the tracks which is fine because the tracks are usually short and fast so it's not really that common for you to try out a track for tens, even hundreds, of times to perfect your run.While I do like the tracks that were built in to the game by Nadeo, the developers of the game, I still do think the genuine fun factor comes from something a little different. Not much, just little. What I'm talking about is the Track Editor which lets you build your own tracks and share them with everyone on the internet. There are thousands of tracks to choose from so if you ever master all of the Nadeos tracks you will not run out of tracks to play after that.TrackMania² Stadium is a close to perfect game in my books. It's fast, fun, challenging and has a level editor in it with easy and advanced tools to create more levels for everyone to enjoy. TrackMania² Stadium is a must play if you are a fan of arcade type of racing games that do not care about realism. TrackMania² Stadium is simply amazing game.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here! ",383,57,14,26,17,4,19

												Very addictive game with a dedicated community. Single player is all about beating challenging tracks in a certain amount of time much in the ways of Trials games. Join others in multiplayer and race around some of the coolest tracks made by the community in a race for the best times, some of the tracks gave me that feel of when I was a kid trying to build some badass Hot Wheel tracks. The track editor is amazing by the way. The community is welcoming and friendly, never had any issues. Their is a leaderboard system that doesn't only keep track of you world placing but also you country and local placing. Like Im canadian so it would tell me my rank in the world, Canada, and even my province placing.

												Have been playing TrackMania's franchise since 2009 (TrackMania United and TrackMania²) and have more than 5000 hours on United and around 150 in TM2, counting those that I launched game outside Steam. I can assure you this game has everything you would want. Do you like technical maps? You can have them. Do you want fast maps? You can play them.  Do you want tracks that look ridiculously stupid? You can have a good time. Do you want to challenge yourself? There are plenty of tracks to test your skill. You do not like your car, I see... No problem, you can download users content and rock a fancy new car.There are unlimited possibilities to enjoy this game. I recommend it, not only for being able to have good runs or being part of worldwide leaderboards, but for being such a good community with plenty of great people to enjoy your time.

												I watched a review of the new Trackmania game but since I was so cheap and didn't want to pay 40 bucks for Turbo, I installed this one. The graphics look decent enough and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The cars behave really well and it is the only racing game I would rather not play with a gamepad (and so shouldn't you). It is definetly worth the 10 bucks, I would say. There are two other Trackmania 2 games - Canyon and Valley. I have no idea if they are better or worse. But they are definetly twice as expensive.

												The oldschooled game is back!With a few new blocks, physics and ofcourse new graphics. Nothing big has changed since TrackMania Nations Forever, bugs are still a particularly problem in this game for competetive drivers and other useres, so it is a bit dissapointing that nobody worked or to be tried to fix those bugs instead of this we have now more bugs in this game than before!On the otherside we have the fun that made TMNF to us back. Another cool feature is that you can switch over the Maniaplanet platform through the different games and enviroments and can also download free and community made titlepacks and this is the quality of this game. TrackMania has a very good community which is very active and friendly,there are not just titlepack who are edited by the communtiy, the community edits new gamemodes and blocks.Overall i can really recommend this game, for the oldschooled players it will feel a bit strange because the car feels a bit heavier but it´s still a nice TrackMania			",14,0,1,0,10,0,6

												I was surprised by how much I enjoy this game!  The car is fast, and most of the tracks are great fun!  I like how most of the races are quick, like under 2 minutes.  One thing I hate about racing games is long multi-lap races that take a long time to re-do if you have to make first place.  This game has a lot of variety in the tracks, and most of them are really fun.  Some of the tracks are lame and don't have any clear direction to go, you have to search around using trial and error.  The menu system UI is very odd and lacking, but not a deal breaker.  The default xbox360 controller layout is very odd, I may customize it to a normal racing game layout later.  Anyways, this is the only one in the series that I have played, and I recommend picking it up on sale sometimes!			",874,233,34,93,134,7,143

												It's literally the same thing as Trackmania Nations Forever, which is still available on Steam and completely free.I guess if you really want to play a free game but in HD, go for it.Oh wait, no. Don't actually. Install the demo, it allows you to play on official servers and compete in official maps. You'll pretty much get the full experience that way. If you really want to buy a Trackmania title, try one of the other Trackmania2 games. Canyon in particular has a neat drifting gimmick and looks a lot more visually interesting.

												I've played TrackMania when I was younger and I really liked it. It has everything for everyone. It's simple and fun so kids can pick it up and start playing within minutes and it's challenging enought for older audience. I think I spent about 100+ hours with this game when I was younger. The multiplayer is fun and simple. The only thing I don't like is the turning. It's not that sharp. But as a kid I didn't even notice it after a few hours of playing. The levels are really well made. This is the type of game in which you need to restart a level a couple of times until you get the gold. And the levels never get boring. All in all this is a well made game that offers a lot of fun and hours of playing.  9/10			",28,7,0,1,13,0,0

												Trackmania is one of the best racing games I've played. If you're looking for a single player story, then this is definitely not where you should look. However, if you enjoy multiplayer or a competitive atmosphere, then this game is perfect. The official multiplayer servers are fun for beginners looking to race with others and improve their skills. For those who already have some experience and are looking to up the ante, there are private servers with tons of custom maps that span all difficulty levels. In addition to the expensive custom scene, there is an intense competitive scene where you can watch pro's make difficult tracks look easy. As an avid e-sports fan and gamer, this game is great for hours of entertainment.			",127,19,5,6,13,0,5

												It's the Stadium environment everybody loves, adapted to work in the Trackmania 2 engine, so everything looks and sounds way nicer! Like, surprisingly so! For a game so simple, a lot of attention was paid to subtle sound and visual cues that really give the Stadium cars a realistic feel to them, even though technically very little about them was changed over the previous Trackmania game.The game comes with Steam Workshop support, but Stadium 2's short time on earth hasn't been kind to it. A lot of what I tried from the Workshop just plain doesn't work anymore. More than half the cars I downloaded give me an ""OldGeometry"" error when I try to load them, suggesting they're either for an older version of Trackmania 2, or were uploaded for the wrong game entirely.But yeah, it's more Trackmania Stadium, aka the best time trial/stunt racing game ever! That's great! But... it *could* be better.			",443,83,23,36,20,4,52

												Why so much time on what looks like a pretty basic, arcady, and completely unrealistic racing game?Well, after 3k+ hours, there are probably about 3k+ reasons. Let me try and pick a few.First off, this is very much skill-based. Even on the 'silly, luck' tracks (which I'll come to in a moment). Play online, and you'll find pro-level gamers showing almost unbelievable levels of skill and achieving the seemingly impossible. But it's not impossible - this is a very fair game. Any cheating is caught and eliminated pretty quickly. All the cars have the same spec, there is no car-to-car collision to mess up your times. It's (mostly) just you, and a track, and your level of skill that determine how well you do.Next, the variety. The track creator provided allows an almost limitless tracks, and the community has produced masses of content. This obviously varies enormously in both style and quality, but since you are generally only on any given track for 4-5 minutes, if you don't like one you just wait it out and see if the next is more your kind of thing. And probably, in those 4-5 minutes you'll try it anyway and still get sucked in to try and beat your own times at the very least.[continued in comments]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 What is Trackmania² Stadium?Although I never actually got to play the original TrackMania or its successor ""Sunrise"" for any part, I regard Stadium as one of the best TrackMania games in the series. Essentially, this game is an arcade racer where you compete against the clock to see who can get the fastest time around the track. However there is a twist, if you're playing online, then be prepared to compete against 50 other people who are trying to do the same thing as you!  It's a Ubisoft game... Will I need a UPlay account to play?Not really... You'll need a Maniaplanet account to play online, unless you're just interested in playing the game offline, then you won't need an account at all, but I highly recommend that you make an account. What's the customisation like in-game?Absolutely limitless! So you can create tracks in the track builder and then share them to the Steam Workshop, or share them to the ManiaExchange website which is the biggest collective of user-created tracks. As well as this, you can create skins for your cars, which includes colours and paint-jobs for the stadium car, as well as entirely different models for your car.Is racing against the clock the only thing you can do?Nope. There are a lot of user-implemented modes in this game. Some great examples are NASCAR, (you drive around ovals at break-neck speeds) RPG (which is essentially a very large track that can take from 5 minutes to an hour to complete) and the likes of other fantastic modes!How's the online community?In my opinion, the online community is the best part of the game. Back in the day, I used to play this game religiously and made loads of friends on the LOLMAPS server. (if you play on there a lot, what up it's Mumbles!) There's also an e-Gaming community behind this game, so if you think you're pretty good at this game, you can crank it up a notch and compete against the REAL good players.Do you recommend this game?Yes I do! If you manage to pick it up on the cheap, then even better! I also recommend trying out Canyon, Valley, Turbo and United Forever if you liked this game. ",55,6,9,12,6,2,3

												This game is known to everyone who likes racing and stunts.I used to play the nations forever in the past, created hundreds of tracks ( most where weird ones) and spent many hours on it. Now with the stadium I can make better creations in better graphics.In trackmania stadium you race in solo or multiplayer against other peoples times. It is an amazing ""you vs everyone"" racing game in which you get to run your car in asphal or dirt.... or even air. The creativity of some people lets you do incredible and fun stunts.It will definitely bring a smile on your face. ",728,225,67,94,121,16,195

												Not much of anything to complain about. Typical Trackmania game with good visuals, straightforward gameplay and comfortably simplistic controls. It's also cheaper than the other two TM2 games. But keep in mind that you can get the Stadium environment completely for free with TrackMania Nations Forever (except for having to sign up for some mumbo jumbo, which you will unfortunately have to do with TM2:S anyway). This game DOES has a few new features that aren't in TMNF (such as local splitscreen and a whole lot of new track bits in the track builder), but I will leave it up to you to determine if the $9.99 price tag is worth it.

												Trackmania is a game I used to sit and play on during my free periods back in my school days so when a follow up game was released I just had to have it. The amount of fun you can have playing with friends over LAN or competing to get the best times on the solo campaign or on multiplayer tracks is unparalleled from other racing titles. Due to the fast paced nature and flexible track creatability, there are endless possibilities of what you can come across in this game thanks to the large international community of creators.9/10Pros/Cons+ Just as fun, intense and challenging as the oringinal Trackmania game.+ The learning curve is easy enough to grasp but leaves room for serious challenges.+ Beautiful visuals but not demanding on your PC - one of the best optimised PC games.+ The map editor, multiplayer and online community add so much extra content.- Gamers who aren't all that big on community content will get bored after the basic content.

My Favorite Racing gameI played loads of Trackmania Nations Forever when I was younger. Some of my best school memories where when we had a substitute in I.T and we all played Nations Forever over LAN. TrackMania² Stadium is exactly that, which new tracks, new leaderboards, better graphics, steam workshop with loads of car skins!It's the type of game everyone can play but your level of skill depends on your understanding of how best to approach a corner, a sudden turnor when to brake and drift to get a perfect line but still retain most of your speed. This kind of play makes it really competitive and as you chase the better times of the top players it can feel very rewarding when you get a great run or take a perfect corner. On the other hand it can also enduce copious amounts of rage when you love tap a wall and lose all your speed or clip a bump in the road and FLY OFF THE TRACK! WHO EVEN PUT THAT THERE.... good times >.> But seriously its a fantastic game and well worth the money9.8/10- Most competitive Racing game... ever. Only way it could be better was if it was Free like Nations Forever was ",588,106,24,58,52,6,99

												For those of you who used to play it waaay back when, it's like TrackMania: Nations Forever.  Except it's better.TrackMania is widely known as being one of the most difficult racing games ever - to beat the different achievements (""medals"") on each track, you need to clock some seriously freaking amazing times.  And then there's the so-called ""Author Medal"" - the medal you can only achieve by beating the best time set by the track's creator.  I've played this game and TM:NF for years and I've only ever earned about three of them, at best.The visuals of this game are absolutely stunning, bringing the cars, tracks, and of course the stadium itself, truly to life.The amount of content in the game is virtually limitless, from user creations in the Workshop to tracks you can put together yourself.  The map creator gives you literally as much flexibility as the game's creators had, and is super easy to use.The multiplayer is a lot of fun too - connecting to servers and racing live with other players, or even having everyone individually clock their own best times, with a time limit to see who can clock the best time the fastest.  It's very easy to set up a server of your own too!And I also like the ""Official Time"" function - that's something they didn't have before in TM:NF.  It's solo-play, except that you can observe your best times and how they stack up to other players across your state, country, or across the globe.The music, as it was in TM:NF, isn't amazing (it's not bad, but not great either), but then again, it's the gameplay we're after, right?The only real gripe I had about the game is this: I noticed very quickly going through the White-level (easiest) tracks that a number of tracks were re-used from TM:NF, just adapted to the new graphics engine.  Really?  If I wanted to play those again, I would have just gotten the free download of Nations instead.But all-in-all, I recommend that you go for it, especially if you love racing and you love a challenge.  After all, it's only $10, and it comes with the free demo of ShootMania Elite.			",88,12,5,18,15,0,13

												Arrow keys. This is all you need to show your skill - no smokes, ults, tactics or anything like this. It's all on your precision and ability to adapt. The best part about TM2 is you can completely forget about whole that 'tryhardness' and just enjoy racing. It's really addictive! Multiple game modes makes this game even better, but there are not so many server to play them - most people stay at fullspeed or 'lol' maps. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this piece of competitive art - even if you're not 'i want to be the best in everything' type.			",65,10,2,16,5,2,5

												IT'S 2.98 AT THE MOMENT, IT WON'T BE A WASTE 16/07/2014Extremely addicting. I used to play the original back before I used steam, and the game may be same as the previous but it is so fun and entertaining.Track mania is basically a Time Trails game, where you have to get to start to finish or finish a good amount of laps in a fast time. Really simple and fun.Pros: Graphics look so good and it runs so smoothly. (A lot of graphics optimization too)Sound is great and custom music! (Cars sound really nice)Track editor which has Beginner and Advanced both easy to use.Custom cars and editorEasy for new playersEasy to play with a controllerGraphics are very nice and can run on really low end PC's and still look good.Multiplier is also fun with friends.Time trails are really fun and you're able to download other ghosts easy, and learn their tricks.CONS:Car editor does not work well on some computers with Intel graphics cards.Multiplier is slowly dying. (Australian servers are always emptyYou have to make a Mania Planet account which can be annoying if you don't know what to do. ",187,31,13,16,14,4,7

												It's a really fun racing game where each of the courses are different have thier own difficulty. Each course is unique and there is no repetitive courses, Plus it had great graphics and you can download different courses and cars from the Steam Workshop if you want a new challenge or creat your own track and share it with everyone on Steam. I recommend it to anyone who loves racing but also likes to have a challenge (If you want to beat the gold or author medal).			",62,8,3,5,10,1,3

												Fun! Addicting! I would not recommend using a racing wheel for this. I use an XBOX 360 controller and it's super fun. Basically you are trying to find the fastest way around each track. You'll need to look for the best racing lines in each situation which can include jumps, drop-offs, flips, speed boosters, and different terrain. If you are looking for a simulation, this isn't it. If you're looking for a twitch arcade racer that's incredibly addicting, buy now.			",69,2,6,0,5,1,1

												This game is AWESOME! Trackmania is like ""Trials"" (or Elastomania) with cars. If you like arcade racing games check the demo. Multiplayer is great - 100% fair play. All cars are the same and are ""ghosts"" so noone will push you from the track. There is only one thing that matters - your skills.   Maybe in Steam i have only one hour, but I've played: Trackania Nations (it's free), Trackmania Forever beta, Trackmania Forever polish beta (check if translation is OK) and Trackmania Forever (for review). 10/10			",318,105,44,19,29,2,29

												At the time of this review I have only just started playing this game but I have played the free version of this game before. TrackMania Stadium is a racing game that anyone can play regardless of skill level and whether you're interested in racing games or not. This game just requires lots and lots of practice as all this game is about is just reactions and learning certain tracks. Different people from all over the globe play this game and their rank is given in respect to their location on the Globe eg. Europe, Oceana etc... This is a non contact racing game meaning that it's not about coming first across the line but more about your time, so what ever server you join will not have any lag which is quite cool actually. If all you care about is skill, reaction times, and all out fun then this is the game you NEED to get. I played the free versoin for quite a while and I must say that it's very, very addictive :) This game is unforgetable and is one of my favourites and I guarantee that it will be one of yours too.

												After almost 150 hours on this game, I think it's time to review.This game is about one thing: Racing against people. Okay, perhaps there's more to it than that. What drove me to play this game as much as I have is simply being able to see my ranking amongst others in the world/local rankings. I made it to rank 300 in the U.S. and in the top 500 in North America. While that's not a lot, there is a competetive sense that keeps me coming back to shave a few miliseconds off of my time.Pros: *Controller Support!*User generated maps.*Great community.*Fun and frustrating, yet strangely addicting.*Everyone has the same stats, no matter what car ""skin"" they have.Cons:*Dry times for servers.*There are people that are better than you.*""Planets"" as a currency system could use some work for the later game.*Lacks some individuality-per-player.Overall: 8/10 Pretty solid racing experience!

												Trackmania 2 Stadium is an arcade-like racing game with loops, jumps, and ridiculously fast speeds. I picked it up  on a Steam sale for around $2.50 along with Trackmania Canyon for me and a friend because it was so cheap. There's a stripped down single player version: No story, no opponents (Except for the predeterminded time goasts), no collision. Just you and the road.The multiplayer is the real reason why you would buy this game, though. The basis of multiplayer is that you have at set amount of time to finish the track and get the fastest time possible, while others are doing the same. There's a ""place"" in that it's how you match up against other player's fastest times. It has an extensive server list, modding community, and track creators, and they're friendly!! Some actually say hello and strike a conversation when a new person joins. Because the game relies mostly on skill, professional racing teams have been created. I must say, server admins have a very good taste in music.On the visual side, it looks very good, and because it's a reletively light game, you'll be running a pretty high FPS most of the time. You can also design your own vehicle skins, either the default car, or something from the Steam community. The modding community can let you race around the track as Sonic if you want. The game itself can be pretty hard, to be honest. Many tracks require split second reaction time with very low margin for error. Don't be discouraged if you crash off the track a few times or if the pros get a faster time than you. Happens to the best of us. The more you play a track, the better you naturally get at it.Overall, try to get it on a Steam sale. You might like it. ",18,2,3,1,2,1,0

												I'm a die hard fan of Trackmania series for a long time. But this game is based on multiplayer and there isn't enough players for fun. They should make the game F2P as before. Lack of players makes me sad for such an awesome game. :(			",19,2,8,2,7,0,1

												It's basically a graphically overhauled Trackmania Nations. But to be honest, I wouldn't want it any other way. I always loved the handling of the car in Nations and I'm used to it. And the handling is exactly the same in Trackmania² Stadium which is a big factor for me. All the old maps and replays from Nations are compatible with Trackmania² Stadium, sadly the skins aren't, but that's not really a big deal to me.TL;DR: If you loved Trackmania Nations, I recommend this!

												Trackmania is one of those games that if you need a ""quick fix"" this will provided it.  Very easy to pick up, this isn't a true race against each other, more of race against each other's time.  While you can see the other racers, you can run into them, or bump them, etc...  More of  a time trial game.  Also comes with a built in track editor to build your own courses which can be published to others.			",32,1,2,9,5,0,7

												Polished racing game that feels, and is, very unique. No collission damage, crisp clear graphics, good controls and sharp gameplay defines this game. In my opinion what makes it cool is the skillcap. It's immense! You can allways get better at this game but it's still very much fun from the first time you play it. If you're a Dota 2 or CS:GO player the in game community here will zen you out, It's the best.

												Be warned its not a game for the racer who expect a career,simulation or progression system. There is one car and the whole concept is around trying to beat your opponent's time and not be first over the finish. With these limitations, the game is still a nailbiting experience. If you enjoy watching qualifying of F1 cars more than the race, then this game is for you. Add a solid workshop, great tracks to download and a strong community and you have a racing game that changes with every play through.			",145,29,31,25,42,3,28

												If you want a game that's just fun driving - no story, no hassle, no traffic, no over-the-top system requirements, no playing for hours to get a decent car - just pure fun driving... buy this!...when it's on sale.If you really wanna try this but the price is a bit high (which is fair enough), look for Trackmania Nations Forever. It's essentially the older version of this, just free.This version has better graphics and stuff but honestly not a HUGE amount of new stuff.That being said, it is brilliant. It has a really great track editor and a nice community. The multiplayer is awesome - it's essentially time trials but with the other racers around you as ghosts. And the singleplayer is awesome for those who like shaving split seconds off your time to get the gold medal. You don't even feel alone in singleplayer, because there's ghost vehicles for each medal time.If you have spare money or this is on sale, buy this.If you don't, get Trackmania Nations Forever.

												Played Trackmania Sunrise and Trackmania Nations a few years ago so I decided to grab the latest iteration of the series as I spotted it on sale. The game engine is still great and I understand that the developers were reluctant to change too much from the mechanics that made the series great in the first place. The graphics have been slightly improved although not the level of AAA racing games, the gameplay and replayability makes up for the lack of polish and eye-candy found in other games.The only gripe that I have is the archaic menus and UI, although not difficult to navigate through by any means, they should overhaul the navigation for the main menu and server browsing, as it is, it looks pretty dated.Recommended for Trackmania fans, not recommended for those looking for more than just simple racing fun(crazy tracks, time attacks).

												Trackmania² Stadium is classed as a Racing game, but as I see it, it's more of a puzzle and strategy. With the single-player mode, you get a set amount of tracks split into five groups of skill level, White being the easiest and Black being the most difficult (a bit like the karate belt system) and within those tracks, there is no room (as I know) to download other tracks and play them alone in single-player.Multiplayer is a whole different story, however. As you get more used to a server and it's map rotation (if there is one) you'll be able to remember the tracks as you play them within the five to ten minute time limit per map, and shave off those precious few tenth's of a second, sometimes even making it come down to the hundreth's of a second, truly making your mark in the track's leaderboard. A bit like Formula 1 in that matter, as it really comes down to the skill of the driver, and the knowledge of the track that you're on.But don't let that deter you if you aren't into that track-precision stuff, as there as many other fun-orientated maps which don't focus as much on your time taken, albeit there are less people on those servers.Story = -/10 (no story)Multiplayer = 9/10 (amazing community, great maps in general, easy to get along with)Graphics = 8/10 (when maxed out, the game can and does look stunning)Graphics Perfomance = 9/10 (runs very smoothly on older pc's and laptops)Controls = 10/10 (personally, I play with a keyboard, but controllers are supported too, and again, how you drive your car really makes the difference)Total = 36/40Final Comments - Please, if you can, pick up Trackmania² Stadium when you can, or even Canyon or Valley. If you have to wait for a sale, then so be it, but if you can buy it at full price, then please support the developers behind the amazing game(s) that is Trackmania².			",72,12,12,12,21,2,5

												Excellent but the idea to split the community across three titles was not a good one. This also isn't an enormous evolution over the previous TM games, despite the ""2"" tacked onto it. There's some more online community stuff in the menus, but I'm not sure of the point of any of it and generally ignore it.If you're going to get any TM2, get Stadium, and probably ignore the other two. Stadium's parts tend to be more versatile and there are more community tracks. Stadium was originally a standalone free version of Trackmania United, and then when United Forever rolled around Stadium was the one environment you could play for free, so naturally it had more players and the community glommed onto it more. Nadeo also gave it a more diverse set of parts in Forever than the other environments, and it's been expanded on even further in this game.There is a demo and I'd highly recommend checking it out.

												Driving games are the most popular genre of all.TrackMania is an infinite driving game, as new tracks are continuously being pumped out by the community.This game will never get old - it's that simple.Go ahead and get the free version (look around you'll find it).Generally I like to play online in multiplayer on one of the full-speed beginner servers (which are impossibly difficult).  Then if I hit a track in multiplayer that's good, I'll find a download for it on tm-exchange.com or a similar site.  The track download process for this game is admittedly clunky, since it relies on third-party sites, but the community is gargantuan.After downloading a new track I'll practice it until I can finally beat it.  And occasionally back in multiplayer I'll see some track I know I've beaten, and I'll try it only to find out I've forgotten some of the subtleties of the track and have trouble even finishing.  They are very challenging tracks, and best of all - continuosly new ones are being developed by a community that won't be going away any time soon.Also, I only race using the keyboard for steering - so I suck.  There's way more control from other controllers - but the game is decently playable with just the keyboard.			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												I love Trackmania in all its forms but this particular version is a huge disappointment. Put simply, it doesn't offer anything new over its free-to-play predecessor Trackmania Nations. There's also the issue that because Nadeo has split the game into three separate versions; Stadium, Canyon and Valley, it has managed to separate the community of players. This has left the multi-player servers somewhat sparsely populated.In short, if you you're a Trackmania veteran, you don’t need this. If you're new to Trackmania you can play essentially the same game for free, so go and play Nations and see what all the fuss is about.			",109,28,26,22,26,2,41

												Trackmania's uniquely in-depth track creator and rule-of-cool physics could have added up to a great game, but the community has utterly killed it.I was sold by the demo servers. The tracks were interesting and varied, the atmosphere was one of friendly competition, and even if you lost you still had fun trying to beat your own time. So you buy the game, open the server list and pick the first one that isn't plain black text.And then it all comes tumbling down.Half the screen is filled with needless leaderboards, ugly buttons that don't do anything and other pointless bells and whistles. The other half of the screen is a horrifically complex track you'll be lucky to beat even once. Most of the time they're so horrifically cluttered that you need to drive off the track and let a replay show you the path, and that still won't help because the map is 60 seconds of madness and you only have 5 minutes to beat it.If this were the game the demo claimed it would be, I would wholeheartedly recommend it. But if you're a newcomer to the series who likes the demo version, just keep playing it instead of wasting your money on a game that's been mutated in a demonic, unforgiving shell of its former self.

												I found this terrible because i bought Trackmania Canyon, Valley and Stadium, all of which i downloaded but once trying to play the game, it claims i have to repurchase them since i didn't buy them in the first place according to ManiaPlanet, Which means i wasted money on games that won't work, if someone knows how to fix this, i will much appretiate it.. but for now, i am quite irritated			",171,22,7,14,14,2,23

Why should you care about my review?I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the ""dream"" of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)Pros-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a ""playlist"" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.Cons-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on ""Stadium"" from Steam, then decide to play ""Canyon"" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the ""Start Game"" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit ""more blue"" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42"" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use ""multiple profiles"" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say ""You must connect online to launch the game."" I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to ""take"" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.ConclusionThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.

												Probably the best and most fast-paced racing game ever.TM2 Stadium is a worthy followup to the traditional Trackmania Nations/United. There is not alot difference, maybe the graphics are a bit more polished.I played TM1 for several hundred hours, TM2 is pretty much the same.BUT, the servers are there and they are well visited, with alot of different types of tracks.TM1 Servers are almost all dead.There are like 100'000s of tracks, it has a great editor to build own tracks.You can drive highspeed races where it just depends on your perfection, you can drive so called ""LOL-Tracks"", where you most likely need alot of luck next to skill. Or Techtracks where you need alot of skill to keep up with the fast guys.Furthermore, you can customize the skin of your car, or even use a completely another skin, like driving an Audi.What I love the most about Trackmania?Everyone driving has the same preconditions, there is nothing like an opponent with a faster car. There is no way to spend money inside the game. All it requires is skill.It's simple and perfect. 10/10 i absolutely recommend buying this game, it is a real Evergreen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Their next game should be DarkSoulsMania² or ImproveMania². (ayy lmao)This game is REALLY fun. For people that think this is a racing game, its really not. This game is about beating yourself constantly and not giving up. You may try ""racing"" but it really isin't like so. If you're looking for a game where you progress quickly and for sure are going to become better at it, this is a perfect game. Just remember to change the controls other wise, you may not be so happy.8.5/10 Really fun :D:			",187,19,2,15,25,2,14

												This is by far the most entertaining and diverse racing game series I have ever played. Do you like racing with tons of other racers on huge tracks or are you more of a solitary racer? Doesn't matter this game offers both and still tells you what your global and regional ranks are.The map editor is still as fun as it was in Trackmania Nations and the car painting feels more smooth now and high resolution. Time to make some epic looking custom paint jobs.This is a racing game for you who wants a little more than just another racing game.			",256,38,9,22,30,3,49

												In my opinion, Trackmania 2 Stadium is very underestimated, splitting Trackmania into three parts might not have been the best idea but I really like Trackmania 2 Stadium. The singleplayer isn't interesting but the multiplayer really kicks things off. Find yourself a good server and you will have fun for a long time period.Metacritic:77 / 100 Metascore7.6 / 10 User Score			",85,19,7,7,7,0,2

												This game is challenging as it is, but then when you add in racing against your buddies, the challenge gets cranked up to 11!  I highly recommend this, if you enjoy time trail modes, and want to race head to head against a friend's ghost. 4/5 Stars on the challenge factor alone!			",305,90,16,97,38,9,103

												Even though the game is fun, Maniaplanet is not very good. Also, asking $10 for a game what is almost the same as a free game (Trackmania Nations Forever)? It's good they don't ask $20, like for Valley. And then people moaning about the price of Valley because 'it is as good as TM² Stadium'? It is because Valley is more original. Stadium is just a consumer rip-off.			",10,4,8,0,12,0,6

												Bought for cheap against my better judgement having owned a previous game. There's nothing wrong with the game. the way it plays, the graphics etc are very good.what kills the fun is the servers filled with awful tracks. quite why so many people build tracks where if you don't judge it just right you fall off the road or don't make a jump you loose and have to go back to the start I don't know. Tracks where its really difficult to even work out where you should be going as the roads cross all over the place.don't get me wrong i've some some really fun times on this and older versions on good racing tracks. make a mistake, just slows your time down. you don't just fly off into the distance and have to start the damn thing again.such a shame because when its good its *really* good fun			",109,35,4,23,29,1,26

												I expected an actual racing game. You know several laps of competition with other cars, maybe pushing them out of the track.Instead this game is about repeatedly racing very short segments until you get them perfect (or just manage to get to the end for the more challenging tracks). As soon as you make a mistake you can reset and restart instantly by just pressing a button. You can do that alone (against your ghost) or on a multiplayer server where you can see the others but there is no interaction with their cars.If you're the type of obsessive gamer that loves retrying something hundreds and hundreds of times, then you may enjoy this.

												You want technicall driving? Get a race sim. You want crazy stunts and awesome tracks out of the workshop? Get Distance!This game is just not worth your money when there are much better racing games out there.Overall, I would say this game is actually pretty solid. Good physics, decent controlls, nice track editor. But it's multiplayer is quirky and the sheer focus on perfect technical driving is tedious and requires more effort than its worth. It's fun, yes, but it could be more fun. Which is why I recommend you look elsewhere for fun racing games. Trackmania was cool when it was one of a kind. Now, it's been made obsolete by newer and better racing games.			",45,5,4,4,7,2,4

												Trackmania Nations Forever was fantastic game. TrackMania² Stadium is not. Why? Multiplayer servers for Laps games, my favorite game mode, are empty almost all the time and in the singleplayer someone with big brain made a change to count your time only once in every five minutes. This resulted in 4 minutes boredom and 1 minute full of stress. When you played Nations Forever you could make mistakes and it was still very fun, because you could try again at once. But now, you'll make one mistake and you must wait 5 minutes to try again. Nations Forever was fun, fun, fun. TM2 Stadium is waiting, waiting, stress, waiting, waiting... Hence I am not recomending this game, because with one simple change they made very fun game to be extremely annoying to play.			",1187,477,55,126,111,17,220

												An accurate description of my experience with this game so far: Bought it because i've been looking for a good racing game, and the original was always rather fun to play. upon loading it up, you don't actually load up TrackMania2, You load up one of those absolutely pointless multiverse systems. You are then poked and proded to log 50 times before you can get to anything that even says TM2 Stadium. Being that I don't quite care much for social aspects of racing games (infact, i have no interest in them other than to drone offline usually) I of course told it to go away and said log in offline. Seems simple enough ok, maybe i can get to play the game; TrackMania2 Stadium -> enter -> ""Title not available""...iight, cool sounds good. So, went to go for good measure try to make an account; Lol no thanks after about the 4th screen, Especially concidering the networking of the game seems to run on peer to peer which is heavily throttled by my isp. So I gave up, and went to look on the forums (always an exciting experience, as i'm sure many know.) Found nothing regarding offline play for the most part, other than some posts in russian that weren't really relevant. Are my issues with this game easy to get around?Possibly, Though I don't quite care to jump through hoops for 2 hours though for something supposed to be relaxing.I'll probably end up getting it fixed someday but, For the purpose of relating ease of access to certain things^^^Is this game a game for people who like an easy offline racing experience?No, wouldn't say so. If you're down with all the multiverse fluff then it could be the game for you but; I'm sure there are plenty out there for who it is not their idea of fun.			",187,28,6,51,23,2,76

												It's Trackmania, still a good game, but after all the definition of ""Lol-Servers"" chaged to let's put all the trash maps there, you can find a mix of mini and mini-tech maps on them. It seemes to be impossible to find a good Lol-Server, even after serveral hours of me and some friend searching we still didn' t find one.A lot of the new maps just suck, there's people messing around with blockmix not realising that it only looks dumb and cuts the track's quality. While those without blockmix are just build in 5 minutes tested once and then Uploaded.The old maps got shadow bugs, so it's nearly impossible to drive indoor passages/maps but those maps are still on a lot of servers, leading to dissoriantion under the players due to the onknown way you got to use.I prefer TM1, better maps and better Servers!

												have never played any of the other track mania games so i was not sure what to expect this will mostly be personal prefernce on this on i think seeing as how popular the series is. start with the good nice graphics, level of detail is good cars get dirty ,rotating axel shafts are visible cool to see fun for a bit .the bad have to sign up for an on line community to play (i hate signing up for stuff especailly when you just wanna play)game is pretty much an arcade time trial  raceing against ghosts, even in online. not what i was expecting there was other modes for online it did appear but i could never find a server for them. says there is a big campaing mode but its not really like a campagin from any thing like i am used to eg, dirt, grid, forza basicily just more time trials and a couple of lap type races throwen in nothing really in the car customizaition.  lots of track editing options not really into to that though,  some of the custom track on line can be pretty bad.so ya i can't recomend, basicly just a non contact time trial arcade if thats your style get on sale,			",37,4,2,0,11,0,1

												I was playing Trackmania United Forever for about 2-3 years. Single player maps there had some sense,you were able to learn to drive from them and were builded from blocks that actually fit. Those maps in Trackmania² which are marked as red and black are NOT more difficult to play. They are NOT designed to make you learn how to drive. They are designed to test you how far you can go till you ragequit. The creator of these maps probably ran out of ideas so he started to build them from some random blocks, adding crappy must-go-slow turns, hell even disabling 1st person camera on wallrides. The only good thing that happened to this game was adding the cyan edge lines on the blocks.			",8,1,2,0,0,0,1

												Yes, it's popular. Yes, it's kind of fun. Yet its physics are disapppointingly despondent towards drifting and have a numbing feeling in general. The cars are also programmed to be mortal enemies towards any wall, making it impossible to recover your race after a single mistake or botched turn. The game seems to be geared towards racing AI that always knows the right line to take. This makes playing the game agitating, tedious, and stressful. Also, there is an extremely annoying and obvious lack of any learning curve at all, as if the game expects you to be a pro-TrackMania player with hundreds of hours logged as soon as you start playing. This once again points to the idea that the game is designed for computers. The basic level editor allows the choice of, quite literally, less than 10 pieces and seems to be designed for toddlers. This is in stark contrast to the advanced level editor, which gives absolutely no direction as to how to use its nonsensical pre-race footage editing tools and seems to expect you to compute shadows every time you edit a map, a process that can take 10+ minutes with all the computations forgotten by the file even after you save the map. There is also no option for car-on-car collision, allowing them to pathetically phase through one another. The game also requires intimate router port forwarding knowledge in order to use several customization functions, which is something I spent all day trying to figure out. Generally the ports are forwarded by the .exe install file instead. Moreover, there is no boost, very few graphics and audio options, and a completely stupid currency system. This is only a portion of the things I have a problem with, but I'll spare the rest. In short, this game is great for people who love experiencing repeated failure, but a dismal waste to all others.			",62,8,7,1,16,0,1

												I spent half an hour just trying to figure out the horrendous user interface of this game. I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (♥♥♥♥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations.			",79,15,1,8,28,2,10

												Just one more time.... is the words I repeat to myself when playing any Trackmania game to acheive the gold medal,this one is no different. Trackmania Stadium is a time trial racing game that emphasizes on beating the time given on a track. The tracks designs are amazing and do add to the replayability. I had my head spin a few times while driving on some of these wacky tracks. Not only is this game addictive but also gorgeous! I love the detail and colors, it's a pretty game to bask in. Controls work a treat,very responsive..... There is nothing other than the damn difficulty that I can find personally wrong with the game. If you love a challenge and enjoy driving on awesome tracks that will suck you in with their addictive style then Buy this game, you won't be disappointed. No hand holding in this game!

												Well this is a fun game! It has very enjoyable driving physics and along with that an amazing community that continues to make maps or car skins that adds more and more hours of fun into this game. The graphics in this game also hold up pretty well from 2013 to 2016 with good lighting effects and nice looking cars. The multiplayer in this game is also addicting while you continue to race many community maps to become the number 1 racer in your area. It is satisfying to see yourself rise up and up until you are in the top ten in your country. So over all this game is great fun, and you can expect to get many hours of racing out of this cheap 10 dollar game.			",84,2,5,2,9,1,11

												It's like those side scrolling motorcycle games, but in 3D and with cars. Forget the single player campaign, it's about multiplayer and its thousands of user built tracks and servers with 50 people on it playing crazy maps. The game's low user score indicates that it is a divisive niche game: either you like full contact racing or single player (in which case avoid this like the plague) or you want a track editor or a lively multiplayer community (what are you waiting for?). There is one issue: it is essentially a HD remake of the old Trackmania Nations, which was (and still is) free. However, $10 is NOT too much for this game. Many people have played Nations for years it really is that deep if you're into what it offers. The other issue is that developers Nadeo have lost their marbles and are trying to push their horrible Maniaplanet platform which forces you to download patches for games you don't own and makes it all too obvious that every -mania title is the exact same game with a different car (or robots with guns in the case of Shootmania) and different tileset.. For good or bad, Nadeo are a unique studio, but objectively speaking this is an amazing game. Didn't we all wish we could climb into our slot cars as a child and drive them around wacky tracks with loops and compete against tens of other drivers? Here's a version for grown ups. Enjoy!

												Literally identical to Nations in nearly every way. I find it personally shocking that Nadeo like carving their games up into chunks that split the community so hard. For what? For the short-term nickel-and-diming?. After making United, which was a fantastic collection with a huge amount of content across seven environments, how can they make such a significant step back? How can they return to selling piecemeal chunks of their game each with their own near-dead communities? And how can these chunks be essentially the exact same as their previous offerings? I don't know. I guess it's something I'll never understand. Don't buy this.			",139,11,22,4,19,2,24

												This game is part of an amazing series of games by Nadeo, called TrackMania. After about a decade of fun, fast paced obstical courses, they return with this game. Fans of Nations Forever will get a kick out of this, since this version of the game is Stadium, which is the most popular venue for TrackMania. Race in Time Trials in Single Player, take to the internet with the Online Modes, play some with your friends in Multiplayer, and also create your own skins and tracks and upload them to the Steam Workshop.If you have crappy internet, and you are looking to get a game that can make the most of a bad connection, this game is for you, simply because all the server has to do is broadcast a ghost of your current location on track and your times, and thats it. Even if you are playing on a server that's far from the USA in places like Denmark, Germany, and France, you still hold a stable connection. Recommended for crazy car racing game fans or looking for some online fun.8.5/10.			",53,3,15,0,14,0,0

												I started playing the Trackmania series back in 2007, By the time i got my 1st gold medal, i knew it was one of my all-time favourite games. Instead of choosing a set car or track, Nadeo lets the players create their own experiences, with multiple creation tools such as creating a track or painting a car. Trackmania is a very competitive game, most racing will be decided by 1 or 2 milliseconds. Trackmania is not about who has the best car, its about who is the best racer. I highly recommend this game, it is one of the best racing games i have ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nicht ganz so gut wie die Früheren teile. Optisch wurde etwas nachgebessert aber die Kanntenglättung ist nicht so prall. Durch aus ein gutes Spiel dennoch finde ich das Trackmania Nations Forever oder Trackmania United forever besser sind. Auch schein die Community ziemlich geschrumpft zu sein.

												After getting the complete version of TM2 during the Steam Winter Fail 2016 (Most of the discounts weren't my cup of tea), I have one thing to say about this game compared to the only other TM game I have played, TM Sunrise.This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).			",40,3,3,10,11,0,3

												This game is part of an amazing series of games by Nadeo, called TrackMania. After about a decade of fun, fast paced obstical courses, they return with this game. Fans of Nations Forever will get a kick out of this, since this version of the game is Stadium, which is the most popular venue for TrackMania. Race in Time Trials in Single Player, take to the internet with the Online Modes, play some with your friends in Multiplayer, and also create your own skins and tracks and upload them to the Steam Workshop.If you have crappy internet, and you are looking to get a game that can make the most of a bad connection, this game is for you, simply because all the server has to do is broadcast a ghost of your current location on track and your times, and thats it. Even if you are playing on a server that's far from the USA in places like Denmark, Germany, and France, you still hold a stable connection. Recommended for crazy car racing game fans or looking for some online fun.8.5/10.			",53,3,15,0,14,0,0

												I’ve played the vast Trackmania series since the Original Trackmania and with the epic Trackmania United Forever title comes one of the environments stadium. TrackMania² Stadium comes with everything the first series was, with better graphics and an overall smoother working multiplayer experience!TrackMania² Stadium is THE best racing game out there with an eternity worth of replay value from content and maps created and driven by the community.The editor is stunning and easy to learn, great community and is different from every other racing game out there!The game in a statement is; easy to learn, hard to master! But whatever skill level you will have endless fun!Overall it comes with endless possibilities, tons of races to enjoy, and a beautiful visual experience while doing so.This is an extremely fun game and this amazing racer provides hours upon hours of entertainment and with the custom map builder each time you play its totally different, I've played over 4000 hours on Trackmania United Forever and Trackmania Nations Forever titles and it still keeps me entertained!The endless amount of things you can do for Trackmania and the community driven tracks is what makes you want to play this game for limitless hours!If you like racing on crazy tracks, stunting at top speed and doing epic barrel rolls, if you like any racing game in general or even just new to the genre give this game a go!98/100			",80,9,10,1,10,2,3

												This is a classic game everyone must have in his game library like Half Life, Counter-Strike, Skyrim, Payday ...  been playing the Nation Forever title for hours.This is very fun, alone or with friends, make fun of them when you beat their time by 0.01sec and tell them they suck.This game require dexterity and precision, one mistake like a slight push of the break or friction of the side of the road will take you from the 5th place to the 34th.There is an ulimited content and variety of tracks, if you don't favorite some server, it's unlikly you'll play a track twice.The community is good and nice.The last part is really important for not being mention, just like DOTA, KSP, and others this game is really addictive and time-consuming, but in an other way, just because the time per tracks last 5min and the loading time is 5sec, you'll be all like : yea let's play an other one and an other one ... but there's still a chance for you to stop before it's too late not like Dota when you know that an other game will take at least an other 45min .""Yessssss !

												To me racing games are ""good"" or ""bad"" depending on how many real players you'll face. To that respect this one is ""good"", but stick to the stadium version.It focuses on the player (you) skills to ride on the race with no collision between cars. To many this can feel like a gamebreaker but it remains unexpectly fun in all of the different available game mods. I'm talking about time attack, rounds or laps here. It really feels rewarding to finish 1st, or even get close to it. If the competion is that hard, not being relagated to the queue for being the worst player can be a rewarding achievement in itself.While everyting about it feels simple, easy to understand, from the controls to the rules they are also hard to master. You will get better and some rides will feel amazing. I'm not a fan of racing games but this one had me addicted. I don't play all the time but I always enjoy when I race on TM² Stadium. And as some famous anonymous guy said once: ""Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted"".If you are trying to decide if that's a game for you, get it already (TM² Stadium) and give it a try. The production value is well worth the price.			",71,26,4,41,14,2,16

It's precisely the same as Trackmania United's stadium component with slightly better graphics and a smattering of new blocks. Trackmania 2 my♥♥♥♥♥♥			",267,15,25,33,16,1,40

												TrackMania is one of the best game ever, but this version of the game feel abandoned, poorly curated and full of bugs; the hole ""maniaplanet"" thing is unnecessary and the interface is extremely poor. The game also tries to do way more than what it should, technical wise, so much that my antivirus (Norton) is detecting the game as a virus and removing it all the time. Maybe going for Trackmania Nation may be a better idea.			",201,31,4,22,13,1,20

												This is a decent racing game, but the interface and game design just make it so frustrating to play.Pros: - Fun physics - Racing against ghosts is a great way to learn the mapsCons: - UI barely works with a controller - Unable to map all buttons on an Xbox controller - Only get once chance to set best time for a map - Requires secondary login to ""planetmania"", if you forget this your game is gone.  No way to recover account with just email address.I bought this game for $2.50 and I feel like I paid too much.  I would advise you stay away from this one.Jager			",365,127,16,32,38,2,48

												One of the worst ""racing"" games I have ever played.People will tell you it's about going fast and doing stunts but it's not.Most of your time will be spent trying to figure out just what the level designer was thinking if you play online. Most of the tracks are cobbled together messes that have no real flow to them, meaning you'll be doing fine one second then flinging over a guardrail because you didn't turn at juuuust the right fraction of an inch to make the next turn causing you to start over. After a few hours of spamming the delete(reset) key, it became evident that racing new tracks was more of a chore than fun.Stick to the free to play version, this is not worth money.

Posted: January 5, 2014
												A few pages into this new Doctorow novel, I was reminded of one of his regular narrative strategies--that is, he often begins his novels by creating confusion in the reader's mind. The narrator's voice shifts, the chronology is confusing or just random, the location of the action (or discussion) is unclear, and so on. The characteristics of narrative that give the reader a sense of where and who and what and why are scrambled. It takes a while for the attentive reader to sort them out. This happens at the beginning of Andrew's Brain, but it's not a longterm problem with the novel. As it happens, the reader soon learns that the voice of Andrew is speaking to (or in some cases writing to) his analyst, an unnamed presence who responds with questions (often left unanswered) and occasional comments about Andrew's state of mind, motives, good or bad choices. Andrew tells the analyst about the failure of his first marriage and his panicky effort to have his first (now former) wife take over the care of his infant daughter by his second wife, who is deceased. We learn all this if we read attentively through the first sections of the novel. I would add that there are no spoilers here.With reference to spoilers, I have to say that I hesitate to tell much of anything more about the events Andrew narrates to his analyst, other than that he tells the story of how he meets and marries his second wife. Beyond that, it would be unfair to reveal the sequence of events that form the main body of the narrative of this uneven but finally very powerful novel. (I started early thinking it might be a 2 star, as I was exasperated by the triviality of much of Andrew's narrative and the too-clever devices Doctorow was using to mix the chronology and the characters to sustain uncertainty and suspense. But once the latter half of the narrative was under weigh, I was ready for a 3 star and even considered 5 star at some point near the end, but 4 seems reasonable.)Andrew, by the way, is a ""cognitive scientist,"" and he is talking with a psychoanalyst. Early in their discussions, he comments:""Your field is the mind, mine is the brain. Will the two ever meet?"" This question underlies much of the speculation that Andrew attempts in his professional research and in his teaching, about which we learn a bit as the novel continues. Andrew is interested in the ways the brain works, how its constitution and structure affect the thought and actions of human beings and other animals, and so forth. Further, Andrew is convinced that he is, in some way, a person who causes disasters--from the trivial, such as breaking a piece of chalk as he is trying to write his name on the chalkboard, to the fatal, as in his conviction that he was in some ways personally and causally responsible for several deaths, as well as some serious accidents. This conviction is based on his observations of his coincidental presence at, or involvement with, the fatal events. But this novel is in no sense a mystery thriller, as I have seen it incorrectly described. It is a drama of perception, precise and distorted, clarified or confused. Andrew is, as we learn early, driven to distraction, possibly to what we would call madness, by the cognitive dissonance that occurs when he realizes his well-intentioned or entirely innocent, or just casual actions result in calamity, usually for others.Doctorow unleashes some of the most dramatic and traumatizing writing of his career in this novel (yes, I have read all his other novels and some short stories), and that is what must be reserved for the reader to find out. Having said that, why not 5 stars? It would be nice to be able to rank the novel at that level, but the deficiencies of the first third, nearly first half, of the novel are real, and very disappointing. But it is a very good example of a novel that should NOT be treated according to the ""rule"" that many people cite, that if a novel does not ""catch"" one in the first paragraph (sometimes the first few pages), then it is not worth continuing. This one may be more annoying than engaging in the first few chapters, but persevere. It's not a long novel, and the rewards kick in soon enough to carry you breathlessly to the end.

												This game is arcade fun, but don't mistake it for any kind of racing Sim.  Single player is all about time trials and getting trophies, multiplayer is ghost competition only.  You are not on the course at the same time, there are no colissions with your opponents, you are racing against their ghosts in real time.  Buy it on sale and it's quite enjoyable, but not a ton of depth.  Great for a little racing fun, but don't expect anything too serious.			",170,27,4,22,27,4,42

												Because I don't want another second wasted on this game, I copy pasted my friend his review, and totally agree with it;I spent half an hour just trying to figure out the horrendous user interface of this game. I am being completely serious when I say this is probably the worst UI I have ever seen in a game, period. It is completely impossible to figure anything out. For some reason the main menu is a browser. For some reason browsing costs in-game currency. For some reason you can send mail, which also costs in-game currency. The server browser is a joke, the controls are an even bigger joke (♥♥♥♥ing arrow keys, are you kidding me?!)Whoever was in charge of designing this piece of crap UI, please find a different line of work that doesn't involve designing anything ever again. Your handywork made me refund this game out of pure frustration within 30 minutes. Congratulations.			",70,9,5,2,12,1,4

												Official servers = good tracks except there is desync issue with cars.Community servers are filled with garbage tracks (90% easily). There is no difference betweeen easy and hard, all have garbage design because you always have to drive perfect. One mistake and you are stuck because you don't have enough track to accelerate so you can't do anything. And how to learn track when mistakes are not allowed?Proof - go on custom servers and see how many drivers can't even cross finish line and many of those who finish have way of times of several top drivers.Play demo as it allows you to play on official servers.It's pathetic that simulations like RACE series are easier to drive than this pure arcade.And, there is Ubisoft which split community into 3 different titles.DON'T BUY.

												I cannot recommend getting this at full price if you already have the original Trackmania, even if you only have the free version. There is little new content to be found - all assets seem to be re-used from the original game, except a few extra shaders have been slapped on.Controller support is as half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as ever. Navigating menus is a pain on a controller - at some points it will favour whatever your cursor is hovering over even if you're only using a controller to play, and at times it's hard to determine what is actually selected once you navigate to a new menu. Which brings me to another point: the game's UX/UI does not have a single bit of improvement over the original game.And to top it all off, the alternative environments (Canyon, Valley) are separate titles which need to be paid for and launched individually. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, guys. You're using Steam as a publisher, so why even bother making an in-game portal for switching between a bunch of games I don't even own?  I only paid £2 for this so I'm not too bothered, but since I've seen all it has to offer I have no reason to recommend it to anyone.			",242,35,16,16,38,3,40

Race a bunch of people to beat a track time.   I really wanted something a little more fun.  The physics are the biggest joke of all.

												Because of the fact that this game is so much alike Trackmania Nations Forever  I am going to compare them.This game, just like Nations, has only one envirement stadium. Game types are almost the same, there are alot less players in this game than in Nations. This game has better graphics and social side (friends and private messaging) of this game (as one of  ManiaPlanet games) is alot easier to use. You can be on server and just decide to join your friend or just see how many players are on server where he/she is without leaving server and returning to main (home) page of the game.Well, I guess you wonder why I spend all this time to write this little and negative about game. Its kinda addictive and right now I have more friends playing this game than Trackmania Nations (or United) Forever.Its up to you to decide is it worth money or are you just gonna play demo.

												Yeah... I thought this game would be a good Game to get... But you just spend you're time Restarting the Race because you fall 1 second behind.... This is not a Game I would recommend playing unless you are ok with a Crappy Physics Engine and Pin Point Acurate Racing to the point where if you just hit the wall once... You have to restart. Which leads me to another Problem... There is no proper restart button... So you have to waste more time restarting the Damn Race then you spend in the race itself... All and all I'd give this game a 2/10 Rating			",36,3,2,6,4,0,4

												The tires feel like they're made of condom wrappers and lube - the engines in the cars are horrible and can barely handle climbing up a hill (when you don't hit them at full speed and even then they slow down a lot) the cars have 0 downforce so they oversteer like crazy and since the tires have no grip you will side when trying to go up one of the many loops or sideways roads. If the cars were faster, had more grip/downforce, and had better tires. This game would be absolutely amazing. The tracks are still great, and the cars do look amazing. But the cars leave so much to be desired I didn't even want to bother. P.S: In case you're curious about what the hell this guy knows about these cars after like 50 minutes of gameplay, I spent that time testing all sorts of tracks and climbing the ladders just as easy as I have any other racing game. I've never failed to get a top 100 lap time in a racing game in my life - so I think I at least somewhat know what I'm on about. If the cars get engine, tire, and downforce improvements someone give me a call cause I'll re-buy it instantly.			",56,8,4,5,9,0,5

												It's just Trackmania Nations with some other solo maps and marginally better graphics. It's not worth any money. Most annoying of it is that I thought that it integrated seemlessly with other Trackmania's like Canyon, but this is really ♥♥♥♥ed up. The devs thought ""Hee let's make a user interface that gives people the impression that other games are incorporated when people buy them, but when they click on the other games, they should quit the current game and load the other"".I already have Steam to click on games I want to play... So no, I will not recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An update. That's what you paid $10 for. That's not a bad thing - the sence of speed got taken to 11, and the visuals look amazing, but there are a couple nit-pickey things that make the older Nations Forever the better choice.For some reason, it never remebers what skin I choose for my car. Every time I start up the game again, it swaps back to the unasigned gray car if I forget to change it. Another thing that suffers is that offline mode does not seem to work, which sucks, because I really like playing 8-player hotseat games against myself as another means to get good at a track.I don't know. I'm going to have to thumbs down and reccomend the older Nations Forever unless you want the slick-neon sheen that 2 brings to the table.			",148,9,13,6,9,3,7

												Complete and utter garbage. There is no other way to describe this game. First of all, you have to sign up for a ""Mania"" account before you can play. Nowhere in the description or once you launch the game itself is that ever clearly explained. Then, once I finally created the freaking account and started up (and navigated around a menu system out of UX designer's nightmare) I found out that for some reason the game does not work with an XBox 360 controller. Digging around online I found that the makers of the game have been aware of the controller mapping problem for FIVE YEARS and have never bothered to fit it. I was really looking forward to building my own tracks and racing around, but in the end TrackMania was a massive, colossal dissapointment and frankly I will never, ever give any Mania Planet games even a second's consideration.

												*They removed everything that was great with the UI from the previous game*They changed sounds to ??? FUBAR ugly ones that sound out of place and flat*Forced blur with no option or config file to disable it*No podium at the end, just a splashscreen with results meaning there is no point with custom models.*Extreme shine on things to make it seem like actual new graphics.In other words, they completely and utterly Ruined this game, added some new tools and functionalities to make map-making easier and more diverse. And the result is a stinking turd any trackmania or racing lover should stay away from. Trackmania United is much better than this ""new"" game.			",69,12,4,17,13,0,19

												Top Gear Magazine's #1 Greatest Game of the Motorsports Generation? I disagree. This game forgets a lot about what makes racing great, and that's turning hard left for several hours and having all of your blood pool to the left side of your body. Pure ecstasy. MAYBE, it really is the greatest game of the motorsports generation, but you know what? That's just because we unfortunately no longer live in the Nascar generation. The young European crowd has flooded the scene with their dopey F1 cars(adult sized go-karts) and their Tokyo Drifters...Any serious fan of cars should boycot games like this, it makes a mockery of true ""motorsports"" like Nascar, circular rally racing and slot car racing by focusing on stupid stuff like formula racing. Uh, hello? Formula is for babies!Because I'm a generous Nascar fan(seriously we Nascar enthusiasts are the friendliest bunch on earth) I will give this game 4 screaming V8 engines out of 9. Do not test me again Nadeo, your next game better be an all American classic.			",279,32,8,34,25,3,42

												If you enjoyed the free TrackMania Nations you'll enjoy this one too. Basically it's just an update with better performance (for me at least) and graphics and no annyoing online limitations of the freeware version of TM Nations. If you already have a limitation free TM Nations you don't really need to upgrade unless you want to be at the heartbeat of the community. I'm sure it's still pretty active on the predecessor though. You do get to use steam workshop though which makes handling maps more comfortable.For anyone completely new to TrackMania, be sure to invest in a controller with a very fine joystick (Xbone One seems fit). My old Logitech controller isn't fit for the fine adjustments because the stick needs too much force to move.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TM2 Stadium is an upgraded version of the Trackmania United environment of the same name. This updated environment brings fresh, updated graphics along with an updated tileset to allow for more creativity in the tracks you can play and create. The cars handle very tightly with, and feel a slightly heavier than those in TM United Forever. If you're looking into buying this game, try out Trackmania Nations Forever first, which is a free version of TM United Forever's stadium environment. If you're hooked on the Trackmania formula, then TM2 Stadium is a great upgrade for the low price of $10. The soundtrack also wins boppingest music of the year.			",219,26,19,18,29,2,34

												I was looking for a game similar to the Nintendo game F-Zero, and this is NOT like that.  From my little experience in the online mode, you race vs everyone, but they are ghost cars.  You can drive through them like they are not even there but you can see them.  For $2.50, it's ok.  ~I RECOMMEND PLAYING THE FIRST (AND ALSO FREE) VERSION OF THIS GAME FIRST~  My vote is 50/50.

												As a 'newb' to driving games, this a great, fun intro to them. My wife got me a driving force wheel and pedal controller, and I struggled with some of the more 'realistic' driving sims at first. I found TrackMania to be easier to handle and get used to the controllers. Also, its fast paced and fun, with what I guess is called 'arcade style' driving physics, but I'm OK with that. A lot of fast paced fun, I've played mostly sigle player but a few online races as well. Colorful graphics and a and an entertaining driving game - plus a great deal when on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play the first Trackmania a couple years ago.  At the time the game was free as the developer was making money off the other Trackmania games.  Trackmania is time trials race style game,  you won't have to worry about colliding with other drivers because you will be to concentrated on just yourself.  It's a fairly simple game to pick up and start but to get the top awards you have to practice and practice to understand the flow of the tracks. Tracks can include simple dirt tracks where you have less grip as contrete tracks, and can come with various loops, rolls, boosts, and free wheeling parts. (Free Wheeling is when you have no engine, just going off of momentum.  Players can design their own tracks and many do.  Most online play is custom tracks where you race off against up to 100 people on a single track.  I find the game addictive to the point where I lose track of time.  I know it's not a Go-kart game but it is still pretty fun and intense.			",107,11,1,18,32,1,40

												Trackmania Stadium is a lot like the Trackmania Nations that preceded it. To me, the Trackmania series is the pinnacle of the stadium racing. How cars drive is the most important part (it works very well, no doubt about it) but the game also looks pretty. The singleplayer races are decently challenging and the online part is a lot of fun. I've sunk a lot of hours to different Trackmania games before they were even available on Steam and it's still a franchise I really like. If you're a racing game fun who's looking for a great arcade/stadium racing, this is the game to get.			",346,47,25,55,22,2,48

												I'll try to write my review in two ways - from the position of someone who has never played any Trackmania game and from the position of that 16 year old kid who started playing Trackmania Nations Forever 7 years ago (a.k.a. Me)From newbie's perspective:The game is quite challenging but not that hard. It's quite the satisfaction getting that shiny gold medal. The maps are pretty and thought out well - with fast straights and tight corners. Loopings and Wallruns make that racing game unique in its own way. Sometimes the maps can be quite confusing though - there are signs showing you where to go but instead you end up in a wall or out of the track. The game is simple enough and very fun. - My cousinFrom my perspective:I played the open beta in 2013 for hours. I liked competing with other people and I even won some of the races. Well High School happened and I thought I was too 'old' for video games so I stopped playing. A year passed and I made a Steam account and started playing Trackmania Nations Forever. My family doesn't like video games at all so I wasn't allowed to buy Trackmania². Long story short - I bought it just 2 days ago. Trackmania² is like TMNF with a facelift. However the single player maps are a different story - those in Trackmania² are simply better. I like the underground block types Nadeo introduced and the double loops are fantastic. Some maps are very generic and remind me of TMNF but others always get me like ""Who came up with this sh*t???"". There are some things that bug me out though. Gold Medals are a joke - you can get them very easily (if you have played before) and for some reason the camera doesn't switch to 3 before a Wallrun (like it used to in TMNF).TL;DR:The game is fast, simple, fun, unique. Really recommending it to people who like racing and competing with others in general.			",14,1,2,1,0,0,1

												Fast, skill based fun. A for all intents and purposes unlimited number of tracks to choose from, with a website to download them all (mania exchange). What more can you ask for? I've put countless hours into the previous iterations of Trackmania, and plan on continuing to do so far into the future. Highly recommended for fans of twitch or arcade racers such as FZero or the old Burnout games.			",162,25,5,10,8,0,7

												I don't think I'm the first to make this comparison but its pretty much the Dark Souls of driving games. Start a map, die. Try again. Get a bit farther, die. Try again. Get a bit father, die. Finally finish a tough track - feel like a badass!! Now that you are a badass, do it again and get a better time - feel like more of a badass!! Repeat forever. Tips: Mute game music and make your own custom song mix. Don't bother with the maps that come with the game (they suck). Only play online on populated servers with good custom maps. Personally I only play Fullspeed tracks...brakes have no reason for being in this game.Don't bother with the other versions of TM (including Turbo). This is the one you want.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TrackMania Stadium is a fast paced race gane with real world physics.  TrackMania 2: Stadium was announced on November 2, 2012. This environment was opened to the public with an open beta on February 27, 2013. The game features the classic Stadium environment that was introduced in TrackMania Nations. There have been some improvements to the graphics, and it uses ManiaPlanet's client and interface. The game was released on June 20, 2013.			",13,1,6,1,1,0,0

												Let's go ahead and get the negative stuff out of the way. Trackmania 2 had the misfortune of being split into several games, each containing only one enviornment. I can see how that might have seemed like a good move on paper (rather than buying a full-priced game, you can simply pay only for the enviornments you care for) but a lot of people in the fanbase will probably tell you that it ended up fracturing the community quite a bit. Another negative thing about the game, in my opinion, is the fact that on the singleplayer maps there's a 5 minute cooldown period in between official race attempts. TM United didn't have that; you'd just pay 10 coppers per attempt and you could do it as many times as you wanted. I'm sure the cooldown timer was introduced to stop people from spamming official attempts, but it sucks to have to wait 5 minutes to try an official race again just because you nicked the wall. This only affects the singleplayer maps though, and it only matters if you care about official races.But this is a positive review, SO...Hello, new racer! TrackMania is a game about getting your car to the finish line as fast as possible. Which seems kind of...""duh"", because it's a racing game, but hear me out. Trackmania doesn't have car upgrades, boost meters, moving obstacles, or collision detection between you and other players. It's entirely you vs the clock, and you can't blame any of your mistakes on not having a fast enough car or getting punted into a wall by another racer. This game is entirely skill-based because everybody has an identical car with no handicaps or advantages, and there's no random or variable elements. If you didn't win that gold medal, it is purely because you didn't control your car well enough to get to the finish line in time. This alone makes TrackMania one of the most well-designed, perfectly fair, violently rage-inducing, I WANT TO KICK A BABY-tier games you'll ever play. It's great, trust me.Coming from somebody that's put almost 100 hours into TrackMania United in less than 2 months (on a crappy laptop) I can confirm that TrackMania 2 on it's lowest settings will not only look better but also run better. The performance is buttery smooth and very consistent. There's plenty of singleplayer tracks, tons of mods for custom tracks, car models, skins, and total conversions (check out the F1 mod). There's also the super-popular multiplayer mode. Even if this game only has one enviornment and less game modes than TrackMania United, TrackMania 2 Stadium still has a wealth of content. Of all the enviornments, Stadium is probably the best-feeling one anyway (although Canyon is a lot of fun too). For the current price of $9.99, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing great buy. If you like it, check out some of the other enviornments too. Hopefully once Lagoon releases, we'll see a TrackMania 2 United. Until then, TM2 Staduim is a great introduction to the new generation of TrackMania.			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. I didn't expect to like it when I got it, but I adore it. It's probably the combination of great performance, a lively community of map makers, and great time attack multiplayer servers. Plus, since it's so cheap, I have no qualms recommending it to friends who might not have a large budget for games.Gameplay. Let's start out with the car. There's only one car in Trackmania. There's a gas button and a brake button. You can also steer with the arrow keys or on a controller. There's not much to car mechanics, but the main variety in gameplay comes from the maps. The maps have a multitude of various doodads that switch up gameplay. There are booster pads that boost you in a certain direction, there are twisty tracks where you turn... and stuff. You can boost and ride on walls, you drive off ramps and make jumps at high speeds. There are fullspeed maps where you never let go of the gas until you make it past the finish line. Gameplay Continued. There are LOL maps which are puzzle maps that have to be figured out. You have to learn about the more quirky mechanics of the game and utilize them to get to the finish line in the shortest time, or maybe there's just a skip that most people don't notice until it's too late. These maps are often really janky but still really fun on multiplayer servers because you can see everyone else is failing as bad as you are. Multiplayer/Maps. Speaking of multiplayer servers, there are lots of great multiplayer servers which run custom maps made by the community. There's no need to download a giant map pack since it automatically streams it to your computer along with some custom music. There are many different kinds of multiplayer servers, but almost all of them are Time Attack. Within Time Attack, there are Fullspeed and LOL maps. There's probably others too, but I mainly play Fullspeed.Ranking System. There's a really nice ladder points system in Trackmania that shows you your ranking worldwide and nationwide and statewide after each Time Attack map you finish. If you beat a player who is waaay ahead of you in rank, then you get a crap load of Ladder Points. It can be fun to see how much you climb. You can't ever lose points so the only way to lose ranking is by not playing. This means that every time you do play, you'll likely be a little further down in rank, but you'll also have the chance of getting more points.Game Client. Maniaplanet is a really handy client that allows you to instantly do things conveniently with your mouse that wouldn't be otherwise possible in a normal game. For example, you can pan the cursor up to the top edge of the screen and instantly turn down the ingame volume and turn up the music volume. It's intuitive and easy. No need to alt-tab out and go into the volume mixer in Windows. Also, I know Maniaplanet looks and sounds like the evil Uplay, but I promise, it's not that bad. Whatever disadvantages it may seem to impose, it more than makes up for it by adding to the game's convenience.Do I recommend this game? Heck yes I do. Buy this game. At base price it's only $10, and when it's on sale, it's even cheaper. It's definitely worth the price. Why? It's got tons and tons of fun, high quality community made maps, and it runs really well and is only like 1GB of space.			",149,34,5,12,9,0,10

												Drum & Bass Simulator 2013.This review has been long overdue, but the TrackMania games used to be really close to my heart every waking hour. I believe the whole TM series has always been grossly underrated as a proper eSports-style racing, and TrackMania2 really builds on that twitchy-competitive-racing feel that the previous TM games offer. One of the game's best selling points is its diverse modding/mapping community, as well as dedicated servers which offer tons of fun racing.Pros The best competitive racing experience you'll ever get. Fast-paced, arcade-style, gravity-defying precision racing (<3 Stadium). Great level editor, as well as built-in replay editor. Really diverse mapping/modding scene. Lightweight, smooth graphics.Cons Will break your Backspace key. The whole ManiaPlanet system has always been awkward in of itself, still is now. Community seems to be dead as of late.Final Rating9.5/10 ",113,17,12,11,22,2,18

												If you've ever played TrackMania Nations Forever and liked it, you should consider buying this. It's basically the same game, but newer so it will have more players now. It has all the same fun you know and love from TrackMania; fast tracks you must try to drive precisely to shave seconds off your time and, more importantly, sweet jumps and wicked twists and loops.

												Pros:+ Very responsive arcade-like controls, keeping extremely accurate+Great Community! There are still lots of servers out there, and there always seems to be a couple servers online for beginners+Lots of potential for a competitve scene (although it's a little late for that, there is always hope for Trackmania Turbo)+Simple to learn, hard to master factor is definetly present in this game, as it has the standard controls of any racing game, but shaving those hundreths of a second of your time to crack the leaderboard somethimes seems impossible.+Runs well on almost any machine+Difficulty to rank up in this game shows the amount of time and skill that some people have put into this game (I'm still the lowest rank as far as I can tell, and I've put nearly 40 hours into this game, yet have almost broken into the top 10'000 players in NA) Cons:- No real reason to buy this game right now without a large sale as the sequal is coming out very soon, but if that game sucks then definetly give this one a go- UI looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ and is very confusing- Singleplayer is useless- Level creater is not intuitive and can be difficult to useBottom Line:Wait for Trackmania Turbo, if it's♥♥♥♥♥♥buy this. It's definetly the best arcade racing game I have ever played. Definetly worth the money I payed at the time.			",147,23,10,17,37,1,24

												Track in Time.No, you won't have any kind of car collisions or machine gun fire in this game, no matter how you look at it - your primary competitors are the track itself and that certain itch just to take the next turn a bit more intelligent to come out of it with an advantage, even it is may just consist of +0.03 seconds (which is not so good) AND a slight boost of acceleration (which is good).Trackmania is one of those game series where it isn't beneficial to analyse it to its roots, at least in my humble opinion. It's fast, it's unforgiving, it has one of the friendliest communities ever and it lives from its mechanics. Nadeo's decision to split up Trackmania 2 into several parts (Stadium, Canyon and Valley) is questionable, but it doesn't really have any impact on the quality itself - in case of cases, wait for Trackmania Turbo, which promises a complete package consisting of several environments once again.Still, for me, this game is one of the best I have ever played. It is always a joy to log in and drive a few rounds on the community created tracks. It's no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, insane, straight forward, curse inducing awesomeness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple, yet can be extremely technical and challenging racing game. No need to worry about collisons with other players. You're only racing for the fastest time. You can create your own maps, upload them to the map exchange (via ManiaPlanet), and have the joy that thousands of players may have the chance to race on it. Or, you can play on one of the many hundreds of thousands of maps available on the exchange. At the time of writing this, player models are still ""buggy"". Aka, the skin you choose may not be set the next time you play or may randomise to one of the other skins that are available. It's not too bad though. Throw in a second competition to find out ""Who knows what country this is from?"", etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a racer fan, I love speed. I also love technical driving and this game delivers on both. While it's frustrating to continually in online multiplayer, there's still a lot of room for the player to improve their skillset. It is hard to get into at first, though, since this game has been around for a while and most of those who play it today are the people who've been playing for years, but that's a fault of the age of the game. So is the fact that many of the tracks are made for those who are perfect at the game. Those aren't fun.The editor (at least for tracks) is very simple to use but there's many possibilities of creations to make within it. You can choose from many parts to construct something interesting, challenging, or just to troll.If you're a perfectionist, you'll likely get frustrated and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at least a few times wihle you play. Don't hold it against the game, though; just blame the aging.8/10			",148,36,10,21,17,2,15

												Insanely fun and time consuming for such a small price. Highly recommended. The large amount of tracks is great plus the fact that players can add their own custom tracks to multiplayer servers is fantastic. The gameplay is fast paced and requires full attention and precision to navigate the courses at high speeds. However, some aspects have been a bit tricky for me, such as the car paint editor freezing my pc. Overall, I suggest you get this game if you want hours of fun for very little money.

												As a original Trackmania Nations patron, I bid welcome to the newest one! Trackmania 2 Stadium has brought back what we all loved! From the crazy tracks, physics and the competition; this racing game is very fun and exciting.Pros: + Crazy track designs and fun physics. (More 3-dimensional than most racing games.)+ Ranges from highly competitive to very casual. (Pick your poison.)+ Custom tracks with the track editor. (Essentially a map editor, but with modular track ""blocks"".)+ International sport. (Everywhere in the world competes.)+ Countless tracks to race on.+ Simple controls brings everyone into the racing. + Customizable music playlists. + Car painter (Click and drag mouse spraying on 3D object, WOW!)Cons:- None. Trackmania has been a favorite of mine for years, so it's only fair that I am biased.Even if you aren't a big racing game fan, give this a shot. It has a lot of excitement and thrill to offer vs. other conventional racing games. As stated, the tracks are mostly more vertical, featuring jumps, loops, suprises, stunts, boosters, etc. 10/10 ",233,20,5,27,18,1,53

												Being a big fan of Trackmania Nations Forever, seeing this game go on sale I had to snap it up right away. It's an extremely easy game to get in to, but has a complex style of play that even serious gamers can get in to and enjoy. This is the perfect game that caters to literally everyone from children, to casual players, to hardcore players. Either you just want to hop on and run some tracks and have some fun, or you want to be serious and fight for the #1 slot on the server or your region, or you and a couple friends hop in to a server together and fight to beat each others times, or you just want to hop on to try and beat your previous times. Each time you play you get better and fall deeper in to addiction.This is a type of game where there is a nearly unlimited skill cap. There are always ways to improve and beat your own and others times. ",161,16,7,33,13,2,17

												I used to play the first Trackmania a couple years ago.  At the time the game was free as the developer was making money off the other Trackmania games.  Trackmania is time trials race style game,  you won't have to worry about colliding with other drivers because you will be to concentrated on just yourself.  It's a fairly simple game to pick up and start but to get the top awards you have to practice and practice to understand the flow of the tracks. Tracks can include simple dirt tracks where you have less grip as contrete tracks, and can come with various loops, rolls, boosts, and free wheeling parts. (Free Wheeling is when you have no engine, just going off of momentum.  Players can design their own tracks and many do.  Most online play is custom tracks where you race off against up to 100 people on a single track.  I find the game addictive to the point where I lose track of time.  I know it's not a Go-kart game but it is still pretty fun and intense.			",107,11,1,18,32,1,40

												The absolute best multiplayer racing game ever created. My favorite and the most popular game mode, time attack, is the best implementation of multiplayer racing I've ever seen. This game is just like Trackmania United but with more players, upgraded graphics, and a nicer interface. There are thousands of maps made by players. Ladder points also put an objective to the game which lets players want to keep playing to rank up. Lots of different map types too, including tech, fullspeed, speed tech, dirt, nascar, etc. You can make this game as competitive as you want -- whether you're after that dedi 1 or just to beat your pb, it's fun for every player. In the beginning, some maps may be hard to finish. You'll be crashing into walls, trying to just finish. That can be fun, but with a bit of practice you can really have fun trying to finish first on a server or beat records. Driving mechanics are wonderful, and the loops and crazy transitions in fullspeed make it a ridiculous arcade style game with endless enjoyment. A great community of people too. Everyone is willing to help you out if you need it and, for example, if you get a good time on a map, people will say ""nt"" (Nice time). From shredding your time down to the best it can be in the limited time the map runs for, to trying to rank up in your region, Trackmania Stadium (and all the other Trackmania games for that matter) is a wonderful game and worth every penny.

												If you're going to get one Trackmania game, get this one.  It seems to be the single environment with the most content created for it.  Great arcade physics and enough variety to satisfy people who want to practice racing lines or those that just want to crash and flip their cars everywhere.  Track editor is flexible and easy to use.  The network configuration is a tad opaque compared to other new games but if you've set up PC games in the past this shouldn't be too hard.  Avoid this if you're looking to have wrecks with opponents, as the name of this game is competing against time or number of tries to complete a course.			",221,50,44,26,52,3,40

												TrackMania remains one of the most fun and speed fuled racing games out there. The addiction of getting a perfect run and shaving seconds off your time is pushed even further when you play online with other players.

												I have fond memories of playing TrackMania, the first one I played I remembered it having an epic trailer when it started up.This game lacks that cool trailer, but improved graphics and still maintaining that awesome high speed TrackMania feel more than make up for it.I feel like this game is somewhere between Mario Kart and one of those realistic racing games. It's serious, but not so realistic that it looses it's fun. The tracks are great and will have you trying over and over to run through them perfectly.Tracks with multiple laps arfe fairly annoying - it's more of an endurance test to see how long you can last until you crash.Still one of my favorite racing games, tied with Mario Kart.

												Trackmania Nations Forever was, by far, the most fun I've had racing cars.  There's something very humorous about spinning through the air at 450 MPH after missing a jump, only to land back on the track, unscathed, and continue as if nothing had happened.This game, being the sequel to Nations, has not lost that same exciting feel I enjoyed so much.  The downside to Nations was the wait times between games (being that it was a free game), and to play the full game you had to pay around $45.  This game is much cheaper, and there are no wait times.  The multiplayer is a huge improvment from any other racing game I've ever tried.Simply put: Try the Demo, or even Nations Forever.  If fall in love, this is the game for you.			",180,67,3,24,26,3,30

												ManiaPlanet has a reputation for making really PC-style racing games. There's a daunting, semi-functional UI, the controls are hard to set up for anything beyond a keyboard, and single-player feels anemic at best. On the other hand, the graphics shine, the infrastructure behind the seamless multiplayer experience is almost unparalleled, and the community capitalizes on that with a near infinite amount of custom tracks.Stadium offers the best ""tileset"" for any of the TrackMania series, with generous pourings of HotWheels-style loops, corkscrews, and vertical turns. Due to this, it feels absolutely exhilarating to finally ace a full-speed (FS) track, and you'll be more than happy to continue doing it to shave off a precious few milliseconds from your time.It's pretty much racing, distilled.

												Trackmania is a series I've known since childhood. It's a BRILLIANT series of racing games, one that spawned a whole new type of racing (sort of, I may be wrong for all I know). Head onto a MTA:SA race server and you will be greeted with tracks that bear resemblance with the TM style.The game itself is epic, but you will need practice to get into racing properly. I've had years of practice, both on TM games and other, so it's not that difficult for me, but I see a lot of players who fail at cornering or falling of the ""walls"" and loops.This is a game that will provide hours upon hours of competitive entertainment, there's a MLG style league for it as well. The ESWC was a competition held back in '06 that allowed players to win $10k!At the end, the game is solid. You can mod vehicles, create your own tracks, so on. This is a game that will live off it's community. If the community dies, this game wouldn't be as great, because multiplayer is the place to be.If you like racing, Speed-Racer style tracks, HotWheels perhaps?, then you'll like this game.See you online! :)			",138,6,16,10,7,1,2

												A racing game that that fully embraces and embodies the ""Arcade Racer"". The tracks all feel unique, range wildly in difficulty, and are short enough that it doesn't feel like a chore to replay a level to shave off a few milliseconds (as opposed races that take upwards of three minutes, where you may have to drive through the same few kilometers time and time again to get to the one corner you're focusing on). It ends up feeling like a condensed version of other racing games, where the races can take less than a minute, the tracks are full of interesting bits and concice, and the controls are very tight.Additionally, the game looks great. It has a unified asthetic and looks smooth and polished, even on my sub-par labtop. The sound and music are not outstanding, but they serve the game well. It also has local multiplayer, which is always a plus in my books.Finally, the track editor is excellent. It's not hard to make a good level, and the level editor makes it easy to make good looking games as well. I've only made a few low-quality tracks, but even then the ability to build>test>tweak>test>tweak>test makes the proscess enjoyable in itself.Would recommend, especially if you've been turned off other racers in the past because you find them tedious.

												I do recommend this game, but on a tricky way: not this game here on sale, but the old Stadium, the free one. AND, when you're done, having spent hours on it finishing the main races AND some custom races, I do recommend wasting your life on RPG races (the ones that take 1 or 2 hours to finish, and 10 to 15 minutes max if you want to appear in the scores...). So there it is :)			",455,114,10,98,23,4,73

It might be a bit overpriced because Nations Forver is totally free but if you leave the game like that the game is worth every cent. You just get what you want: A basic competitive time attack racing game, with a community building various of tracks (with the simple track editor you can use too!) and a very thrilling ranking system where you have the opportunity to show the word what you can do!

												This is a really fun and addictive racing game where you will find yourself travelling at ridiculously high speeds, over jumps, around loops and drifting around corners. The single player mode provides a challenge and you will want to keep improving your times to move up the leaderboards, but the game really shines in multiplayer. Races can be tense and very exciting and final results will often be decided on just milliseconds. The tracks and other content produced by Nadeo are good enough, but the many customisation options bring so much more to the game. The level editor in particular is mostly simple to use and there are many good tracks provided by the community that add a lot of variety and will keep you interested in the game for a long time. The other TrackMania games are very good as well, but the track features and excellent car handling that form the Stadium environment make this game come highly recommended.			",262,57,14,15,22,1,43

It's simpilcity keeps me coming back to try for every 100th of a second I can grab. Then there's the editor. It's like having your own, unlimited hot wheels set that you can drvie on. It keeps the game fresh long after you've mastered the prebuilt tracks.			",160,29,19,7,46,3,19

												Simple, yet can be extremely technical and challenging racing game. No need to worry about collisons with other players. You're only racing for the fastest time. You can create your own maps, upload them to the map exchange (via ManiaPlanet), and have the joy that thousands of players may have the chance to race on it. Or, you can play on one of the many hundreds of thousands of maps available on the exchange. At the time of writing this, player models are still ""buggy"". Aka, the skin you choose may not be set the next time you play or may randomise to one of the other skins that are available. It's not too bad though. Throw in a second competition to find out ""Who knows what country this is from?"", etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trackmania, where microseconds make all the difference. A very good game featuring offline and online play along with a track editor. The editor isn't bad but isn't packed with features by any stretch of the imagination. Arcade style gameplay means that no racing wheel is required meaning that no disadvantages arise if you aren't lucky enough to own a wheel. Graphics are one of TM's strong points with dense grass and high quality textures and reflections. Overall this game is fun, easy to play (but hard to master) and can be played on almost any modern computer system making it worth the price of £7.99			",114,14,7,10,18,1,5

												If you're going to get one Trackmania game, get this one.  It seems to be the single environment with the most content created for it.  Great arcade physics and enough variety to satisfy people who want to practice racing lines or those that just want to crash and flip their cars everywhere.  Track editor is flexible and easy to use.  The network configuration is a tad opaque compared to other new games but if you've set up PC games in the past this shouldn't be too hard.  Avoid this if you're looking to have wrecks with opponents, as the name of this game is competing against time or number of tries to complete a course.			",221,50,44,26,52,3,40

												well, okay... where do i start with this game...it is a masterpiece for every racing fan out there. for the most Lunatic racing ones,that like the style of jumps,crazy maneuvers and fast paced action, and for those (like me) that like to recreate(and create) their own motorsports tracks (to some degree)... hell even oficial competitions are made on this game and they are superbly fast paced,hard, and challenging depending on the playstyle you like.-you like jumps, ramps, and all that jazz?! this games is for you.-You like motorsports, and always wanted to compete in circuit competitions,and even real world tracks made by superb third party developers?! this game is for you.-you want to free your inner Herman Tilke and create the track of your dreams using... heck... pratically everything the game can offer to you,and even go as far as off the map?! this game is DEFINITIVELLY for you.a community of mods,tracks,vehicles so big, that you can find pratically any car you want to drive... and i mean... ANY CAR... (even tho i still miss my Mitsubishi GTO... Put it on the game modders, DO IT!!!). this game is made from users to users and it is so fun, i literally spent Thousands of Hours playing it. i really mean it.-Pros:Fast paced game, this version in particular, has the most responsive manchine of the trioVarious Styles of Gameplay that can suit what you wantSteam Workshop and Billions of mods,tracks,cars... everything...Easy to handle, Hard to mastera Time Attack so Addictive, you will find yourself playing for hours to get the best times... and you can play on tracks that to finish, it takes hours (some made by myself... like the ifamous 5 hour Le-Mans recreation of the 24H event).Did i mention that you will spend thousands of hours in this game?!-Cons- Poor Handling of the Seam App with maniaplanet itself. Thankfully you can download a clean Maniaplanet standalone from the Nadeo Site for free and mantain the TM title, without using steam... because if you gonna have Stadium and other expansion (like valley or Canyon for example) in the same PC, to integrate both of them togheter you gonna need the Standalone. that's why it does not register most of my gameplay here... but i can guarantee you that my playtime is certainly 100x more than the Steam shows.- Size Constraints on Packs, this will not affect most of the users because the mods rarely exceed 2GB of size. but for us advanced modders that make entire tracks on 3D modeling programs and then post it compilated with other tracks in a Mod, this is a GIGANTIC ISSUE. and NADEO DID NOT, and i Repeat, DID NOT CORRECT THIS AS OF YET. it is very frustrating to do a Giant 10GB pack with tons and tons of real world tracks, just to see that it doesn't work because of the size cap of the packs.- Custom low-poly trees and single face objects handled wrong by the engine, especialy trees and such, that uses the famous 4 face object technique to save space. the trees that should be in front go to the back, and the back go to the front if you know what i mean.- no Customizable Imput for custom textures. come on... this is aggravating especially when you need to do a 3d object to do the horizon every time you wanna do a new long distance horizon to your track.Final Veredict: 9.8/10a Badass game nonetheless, and if you are only here for the ride or for the already done mods, is a 10/10. unfortunatelly i cannot give a 10 because NADEO is slow to solve simple issues for modders like these i stated. i did not reduce too much it's rating because, it is a moding thing outside of the game, but Nadeo could had worked more to give the final cherry on the cake this game needed.

												Absolutely stunning racing game, with a massive variety of tracks and a very easy to use level editor to make your own.When you can't do it, it's the most infuriating thing in the world. However, when you finally achieve it, when you finally get in the top 16 or even in 1st place, it's the best feeling in the world.It's not realistic. It's not exactly an accurate simulation. But who cares when you're blasting at 500 km/h around an insane track, relying on less-than-split-second decisions to keep you in the race?They say that video games can improve your reflexes.This one definitely does.The only damn problem is the swarm of Germans and French. I swear to god that 50% of all the players in this game come from one of those two countries. And we all know that it's really hard to beat German efficiency.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played Trackmania United (trackmania 1) for years and this just brings back all the memories by keeping:-great comunity-skins-custom tracks-everything from TM1This just made the old game I loved look better than it already was, I recommend this game for the price it is, don't buy Trackmania Turbo over this because this is the true Trackmania!

												I have fond memories of playing TrackMania, the first one I played I remembered it having an epic trailer when it started up.This game lacks that cool trailer, but improved graphics and still maintaining that awesome high speed TrackMania feel more than make up for it.I feel like this game is somewhere between Mario Kart and one of those realistic racing games. It's serious, but not so realistic that it looses it's fun. The tracks are great and will have you trying over and over to run through them perfectly.Tracks with multiple laps arfe fairly annoying - it's more of an endurance test to see how long you can last until you crash.Still one of my favorite racing games, tied with Mario Kart.

												Trackmania is a series I've known since childhood. It's a BRILLIANT series of racing games, one that spawned a whole new type of racing (sort of, I may be wrong for all I know). Head onto a MTA:SA race server and you will be greeted with tracks that bear resemblance with the TM style.The game itself is epic, but you will need practice to get into racing properly. I've had years of practice, both on TM games and other, so it's not that difficult for me, but I see a lot of players who fail at cornering or falling of the ""walls"" and loops.This is a game that will provide hours upon hours of competitive entertainment, there's a MLG style league for it as well. The ESWC was a competition held back in '06 that allowed players to win $10k!At the end, the game is solid. You can mod vehicles, create your own tracks, so on. This is a game that will live off it's community. If the community dies, this game wouldn't be as great, because multiplayer is the place to be.If you like racing, Speed-Racer style tracks, HotWheels perhaps?, then you'll like this game.See you online! :)			",138,6,16,10,7,1,2

												TrackMania is a great series of games.  Simple gameplay, complex tracks, brilliant fun.Think of it like Formula One meets Hot Wheels.Pretty much all of the racing is against the clock.  Either in solo mode or multiplayer there is always a better time to beat.I love the simplicity of the game, keep it clean, drive fast, beat the time.Some af the tracks will make you question your sanity, or at least the sanity of the designer.Not enough tracks?  Download more, there are thousands!			",46,2,5,1,2,0,1
