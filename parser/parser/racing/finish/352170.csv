												Fundamentally cruddy, broken and unfinished, an opportunity gone to waste.The UI and menus are an eyesore and mostly don't make any sense and furthermore aren't even translated (from Russian) in some places despite setting the language to English. There's supposedly lots of content, cars, tracks and customization, yet every race plays and feels the same, which in MadOut's case is not a good thing. There's no objectives, tracks are extremely linear and bland, the cars handle like shopping carts and the weapons don't really do anything at all. All the advertized visual settings don't do anything for the game because even maxed out it's painful to look at. Mind you most of the sceenshots and even the trailer video are heavily post processed, for a good reason. MadOut needs a complete rework in order to justify any kind of pricetag.Do not buy this; it's♥♥♥♥♥♥			",369,100,28,47,40,7,44

												MadOut is basically one of those games that make graphics look cool to get people to buy it, just to have the consumer realize that what he has bought is not a game, it's a creation made by the devil himself.The menus have no effort put into them and are hard to navigate, the translations are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥and the maps are simple and boring as ♥♥♥♥.Well, not only that, but the gameplay itself, as in racing is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t requiring more luck than skill, and is full of bugs that are yet to be fixed. -Example: The bots disappear midgame and you are alone.(They won't be fixed, lets be real)So in a nutshell, don't buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥Linux user? Read this:-You may see comments saying ""If you are on Linux you might have fun"", but I had more fun playing SuperTuxCart for ♥♥♥♥s sake. (A game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics that has animals race) At least it required more skill than this piece of crap and not luck.			",136,17,2,4,10,1,8

												I bought this game on a whim during the summer sale. It isn't for me.The gameplay is loose and isn't tight at all. It could use some fine tuning. The cars feel like they float. Maybe just bad physics in the game engine.The graphics are alright. I wasn't expecting superb AAA graphics, so I wasn't let down. However some of the special effects look bland and didn't provide the awesome factor especially when you wreck someone. I thought it'd be similar to Blur. Being arcadey and having power ups, buuuuut its in its own league.Best bought for kids entertainment and value. Since their expectations won't be so high lol.Overall I'd rate it a 60 out of 100.

												while the handling and damage model is acceptable, rest of the game is not worth that money. tracks are boring, textures are terrible. There are translation errors and text overlapping in the menus. It feels like mobile game more. if it was 3x cheaper it would be acceptable i guess.			",300,70,12,30,26,1,49

												If you are on Windows, don't buy it, you have better options like the BugBear's games FlatOut, FlatOut2 and Wreckfest.But if you are on Linux and haven't another options, maybe you can enjoy it. This game has nice graphics, a good  soundtrack, nice cars and nice speed effects, but suffers with boring racing tracks and has some erros that you just don't believe how the developers do not correct before release it on Steam (like the position counter, which is wrong for most of the time).  It is like 70/100.			",14,2,3,0,2,0,0

												This is a bit dissapointing actually...It's not what I expected. I will start by talking about all the bad parts of the game.1. Game starts in with a small screen. Full screen will probably lag your game and it will be harder to play.2. You start off with 15k$ and you can basically everything you want with all of that money.3. No car selections, not too many guns, rockets, etc. The biggest selection you have are wheels, which you have to rebuy them every time you want to change a wheel. There are no cars to choose but only how the car looks like. (The graffiti on the car)4. No multiplayer, it's just with bots and I bet it'll be a bit more fun if you could play with friends.5. Sounds for guns, rockets, turning, etc are the same. When you turn, every single time it makes the same turning sound. Every time you shoot, it makes the same shooting sound, etc. It's not too bad, but at least the sounds better.6. No gamemodes. It's just racing and getting to the end, it gets boring pretty quickly.7. Something that doesn't make sense, I was on the first place, it was saying I was on third. I was third place, it said I was at first place. Probably just a small bug, but I would like to know which place I'm on.8. The music...it just gets annoying. Maybe some of you liked it, but it's not something that I would like to listen to every day.There might be some that I missed or forgot, but the game is already pretty bad with all of these facts. I don't have any good stuff to say about this game. Excpect on how the cars look like, some are cool. If you're a person who loves racing games..Maybe, just maybe you'll enjoy this game for a while, but I doubt that. I had fun for the first 10 minutes. But on the fourth level I got bored already. I would rate this game 4/10, it's just not a good game. ",46,5,0,1,4,2,2

												I was looking for a good racing game with combat elements and again I got disappointed.Negative pointsGraphics - Pretty bad. Maybe due the fact that this game is just a cheap mobile game port.Level/Track Design- Very, very bad. It seems that they just generated a few track section elements and after that they put this few elements together – over and over again. Sometimes they call it a new track when they changed the daytime (no weather effects – only the switch between day and night), sometimes it is the same track just reversed and sometimes it looks like they just change the amount of enemies or laps. 50 tracks they said? More like 5 settings which got combined over and over again until they got their 50 boring tracks.Sound- Also very bad. The sound mix from this game sounds horrible on my 5.1 system. Nearly every sound effect comes from the rear left/right speakers. Also some effects are so damn loud while other sound effect, like the enemy car engine from beside you, are as quiet as a graveyard.Gameplay/Game design- Again just ridiculous. Well what else could I expect from a russian game? I mean the position notice is still in russian language and was not even translate..- You only got only 3 weapons. 1 rocket launcher, 1 minigun and 1 mine thrower. The minigun and the rocket launcher are hitscanning weapons so you just have to get in range and pulling the trigger – Aiming works automatically (you always aim perfectly on the next enemy in front of you as long as you are in range). - You got only 3 powerups – Turbo, Shield, Health. Boring and often very bad placed.- General gameplay decisions like:If a car got destroyed it will fly around for a few meters and while it does this, the wrack can pickup powerups/ammunition. Also the destroyed car can fly into the finish which count as successfully ended a race..When you got destroyed you lost all your ammo. The ammo boxes will lay on the ground as ammo packages. Normally you will just spawn into the packages and pick it up again so this is pretty useless. No stats for the cars. The cars which I got just feel the same in handling, accelerationand top speed. You only spawn with half of your life after you died (maybe a bug?)AI- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It is just a matter of luck if you win or lose. The enemies are always faster than you. You have no chance to get them when they are out of sight for one moment. - Also it seems that the cars stop fighting when I was too far in front of them. Unfair, pure luck, zero fun.- The AI dont lose control and their cars are always stronger. If the AI wants to go right than it goes right no matter if you are in the way. And if you are in the way than they will push you away without any problems – dont even try to push back even if you would have a tank! The AI would still kick you out of the track without giving a ♥♥♥♥.Pricing- You can clearly see that this game was a rip-off mobile game before it was added to steam. The prices (especially for new cars) are way too high, after I played some maps I got less money for kills and the money penalty for dying is as much as 2 kills now. At least they deleted the ingame store from the original mobile game. (on the mobile game you could buy ingame money for real money)Bugs- The game is full of bugs. Examples:The race ends on many tracks far before you reach the finish line (like 100 meters before) The game doesnt update your position correctly sometimes so you can lose a race even when you finished firstAmmo packages slide out of the map very often and the colliding boxes for these packages ares bad so you can get trouble with picking them up I didnt receive my money after some races. I couldnt purchase the nitro update for any of my cars If you bought an update for your car it wont save the old part so you have to pay for every change again. After you respawned your car it still looks broken. Even when you got fully recovered via powerups your car will still looks like scrappedMultiplayerDoes not exist. No one would play it anyway.StoryDoes not exist. Finish all maps – the end (without intro/outro of course).Neutral pointsMenu and settings- Clearly a one to one mobile device port. Configuring the few options works ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Destruction- Is buggy and doesnt look impressive but at least they did something like damage models for the cars and breakable environment (of course only some, small objects!).Positive pointsNoneConclusionWasted potential so dont waste your money and time for this waste. This is just another crappy mobile game port from some random russians who want to steal your money. 10 euros for this is pure scam. You cant compare this games with games like Blur, Gas Guzzlers or Carmageddon - even Post Apocalyptic Mayhem and Fireburst are better. This game belongs to crap like Death Track Resurrection or Carnage Racing			",494,38,33,12,39,3,34

												This is poor copy of Gazz Guzzlers. Difference: something is worse or missing - that's all. Nothing better, nothing new. Good things - runing on Linux and is stable without lags and other inconvenience.Overall, this is fun game and I recommend it for Linux users. Windows users do better if they look for alternative.

												Arcade type game. Not bad. UI could use a little work; I couldn't turn off obnoxious music. Under 64-bit linux it was missing a i386 library (run sudo apt-get install libreadline6:i386); see forum post https://steamcommunity.com/app/352170/discussions/0/615086038671746098/ .I think the idea for developers is to enter the <=$5 android market.
