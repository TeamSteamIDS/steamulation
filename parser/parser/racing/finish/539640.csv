												//Neweer Updated Review (11/27/16)TL;DR: Decent IO game with server problems and a clunky UI. Theres worse, but there's better. Don't recommend because it still needs a lot of work in the state it's in currently.So I sat on this game for a while, just hoping the devs would update it and fix some of the points that i brought up in my older review (below) and for the most part, the game has been changed for the better. First off, it seems that they fixed the stupid glitch where you die to your own trail sometimes, which was ""game breaking"" basically. This could be false but from the time I played after the updates, it seems to be true. There is also now competetive edge which is long overdue. Killing others gives you more points and there are kill streaks apparently, but I never witnessed any. Floating around the map are powerups that you can use to your advantage too, ie double points and triple length trail. The UI is still clunky, but whatever, that's not much more than a peev of mine. The gameplay is improved in total now with how the game works which is nice (now there's a spawnpoint, and there's goals). Really the only thing Ia still have beef with is the population of the servers, which I know isn't really in the devs control, but it still is a real pity, and just the servers in general. People stutter around like crazy, it's laggy, albiet better than before, but still laggy, and the scoreboards are pretty whack, sometimes not displaying the names of anyone. In total, if you like .io games, there are better ones, but there are worse. For what it is, it isn't a steaming pile of crap, but it isn't the opposite either, it's just kinda meh, and that's why I don't really recommend it. (Also I just really am not a fan of io games, I just really like the dev and love to see his work, Hi Kas ~).//Old Review (Still Kinda Relevant)Well, you tried I guess you can say. This game is VERY buggy to the point that it's unplayable at times. If you make too sharp of turns, you'll die in your own trail. The trail collision system is just broken and I frequently saw people just passing through them like they weren't even there. I don't know if this is server issues or just faulty code, but it's a problem none the less. With the trails, sometimes they just don't even work. They'll appear atrophied and stretched, or get slanted somehow and it's just weird. The customization feature is fine, but it's a janky selection screen that would be better as a list possible because it's hard to find the specific car you want to use without cycling through the whole thing. Finally, my real gripe with this game is that there really isn't much of a competetive edge like other .io games have, and pull of much nicer. There is literally from what I have seen zero reason to seek out and destroy other players. There isn't much people playing for one, the most I saw was nine, others don't really seek you out, or you're just too fast to ever get caught in a trap, and it's just not fun. I mean, I got bored and quit before even hitting the ten minute mark and that's saying something.Fix these bugs/server issues, optimize the UI's, tweak the gameplay and this could be a decent tron like .io game, but right now it's just not.

												How many of you guys remember the old game Snake?  How many people tried a variant called Slither.io (an MMO version of Snake)?   That's exactly what this game is...though some have associated this as Tron's light cycles, which isn't incorrect either.That being said, is an in-depth analysis necessary?   Not really.  ""Pellets"" (or ""Fuel cells"") are collected and increase your speed in increments each 10 pellets, maxing out at a score of 100.  It's nice to see that this person tried to make an MMO game, though....but all the ""Youtuber"" skins is completely unnecessary and comes off as ""Suck-up-ish"".  At least there's free achievements, though.The previous ""Random Death"" bug seems to be fixed based on recent experiences (latest play was 12/15/16) and a few changes have been added.  These changes include a clear spawn-point that kills if you touch it along with items and a chargeable boost.  I could never figure out what the ""X3 Corner"" item was supposed to do.  Unfortunately, the game's life is still limited as you'll find yourself bored after 5-15 minutes of playing.  The only possible bug I could point out at this point in time are users that appear to drive directly through my trail, which doesn't make much sense...especially since I can only crash when I try to test out the theory of this working under any circumstance.Sadly, the original game already exists.  What the hell is with all these "".io"" games anyway?  Can somebody explain?3/10  Good concept, though the game already exists for the same price (Free)...and gets pretty boring relatively quickly.

												You know how the main appeal of .io games is that you're supposed to kill other players to level up faster? Apparently the devs missed that memo, because in this game there's no reason whatsoever to be anywhere near other players....Although it's supposedly been fixed now. I guess this review is outdated.			",1079,428,34,131,112,11,220

The Lightbikes are currently in the shopGame is Free, has achievements and free steam cards. Sounds good right! Well....Update (25/10/2016)I got to 130 score and randomly died. I didn't hit a border wall, I didn't hit my own trail and there was no one around me when I looked at the minimap as well as on screen. 2nd time it happened there was only one other person in the game and I randomly died with no one else in sight.... I managed to get to 500 on the 25th without dieing when there was no one else in the server so It appears to be a player related issue. Was going to farm some cards as the game offers them but when I checked how many you get it says 0 cards remaining out of 8? I haven't even recieved 1 card yet so I assume thats also broken right now :/I did get 100% achievements in this to add to my list of 100% game so it wasen't a complete loss but I also cannot reccomend it still as the multiplayer is to broken at the moment & there is no reason to PvP which is pretty much the whole reason of .io games.- Multiplayer doesn't work well with random deaths, no reason or reward for PvP3/10 ",588,106,24,58,52,6,99

												Racecar.io is a free to play Online Multiplayer Light Cycles like game.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok.  You can graze on dots for score. You can kill yourself by hitting your trail, the walls of map or other players trails. Pick up a powerup to increase your speed. You have several cars unlocked and you can get others for free, but the game sells cars packs to support the game devs.  You can play for free.  You only have 1 life to live in the huge map.  Very low replay value.  Has some easy Steam achievements. Another game with dot IO ending of the name. Try it and delete it. For more info:

												Racecar.io is an MMO version of Snake. It's fun, the players are on a fairly balanced stage and it's not too difficult to get all of the achievements, especially if the game is pretty empty while you learn the mechanics. Initially you will probably hit yourself a few times because the trail you leave behind is wider than you, so if you don't predict it, you'll crash a lot.There's not much to say here other than that it's multiplayer Snake, bugs aren't too common, the worst thing that happened was someone with 500 ping outmaneuvering me when my trail clearly hit him. You're at the mercy of anyone with crappy internet, if you start encountering these people, just stay far away on the other side of the map and let them do their thing.Overall, a quick, fairly fun 100% that can be accomplished in under 10 minutes			",835,243,20,102,123,7,117

												Racecar.io is a deceptively simple looking cartoon racing game, but quite tricky to play in practise, particularly since you're playing against real people who cut you off and kill you with their trail. However, I ended up being my own worst enemy in most games, since your own trail can kill you too!  I enjoyed the ""cardinal points"" steering system once I got the hang of it. All around, and enjoyable game.Make up your own with the gameplay

EXAMPLE i just carefully scored a 592 and yet my high score says (0) above the little twitter, YT FB icons. HOW COME? i've noticed this on multiple occasions of getting any high score btw not just this one instance.I like the new particles, the name displays, and the trail kill system. i am NOT crazy about the the new speed boost system though. it's OK, I guess -everyone being at the same lowish speed, then grabbing ten bits for a well timed SPEEDY ESCAPE or ""reck"". However, I liked the old method probably even better, of gradually getting faster with the more bits you eat. So I miss it.. MAYBE mix the two somehow? Find a balanced medium? I am still loving this game, it is wonderful! Great! and a good time passer. Super fun and I am looking forward to it's progression! Only other things I can think to add is i still think a weekly reset leaderboard (or some leaderboard) and easier car customizations would ROCK.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Netcode isn't good. Lots of lag. I don't really like the fact that you can turn so sharp you hit the front of your own body but that could be a gameplay choice that they made instead of an oversight. Gamepad only works by pressing a button to turn right or left instead of having directional pad work like you would think. Basically forces you to use the keyboard.Lastly there are acheivements for sharing the game on social media which is an aweful thing to do.			",1770,332,67,250,100,16,270

Pros- NoneCons- Seems like there's only one server in total.- Laggy- Buggy- People can drive through your trail, even though it's clear, that the objective of the game is to take out other cars by causing them to crash into your trail.- Sometimes, when you do a very ordinary turn, you randomly die.

												This game could be some casual fun, were it not for the fact that you can die randomly. The .io games are based around collecting points and screwing other players over your large trails that increase as you gobble up points (think mobile phone Snake, but multiplayer), but when the game arbitrarily feels like sabotaging your entire progress, what's the point?Avoid.

												Honestly, before I say anything, not many people play this game. It gets very lonely fast. During my gameplay I had some people join in. But they Left in the first minute. I guess they thought it was boring or something of the sort. Honestly guys. If you like this game share, spread the word so it can get better, and not be so lonely. People who dislike this game, Share it also, because if you don't, how will your problems with the game get fixed?I sat on my but playing this game and played this game for no more than 15 minutes and earned all the achievements. I must say the sharing achievements are a bit bugged. But other then that. The gameplay is good. Just wish there were more people on. Overall, if you have a friend or something that would like to play or played this game and liked it. It would be alot more fun with people playing with you. As I said before. Very lonely thats why we need to spread the word of this game. It will get alot more fun in the future because I believe it has potiential. Well thanks for reading. Do Spread the Word.
