												Pros:-Good Semi-Simulator-Good Graphics-Challenging-Inclusion of Moto3 and Moto2 gives this game a much easier learning curve-AI are actually good at avoiding you, unlike some sims-Lowsiding, highsiding, skidding all feels appropiate and can be hard to recover from-Difficulty levels actually make sense. Easy is easy and Realistic is just that. Realistic AI laptimes are actually faster than real life to match a player's ability to do so.Cons:-Sound feels a little dated-Limited helmet choices and they are all very similiar.-It's too easy to run on the grass or clip a sand trap without falling, doesn't feel harsh enough-The game has a thing for rain in Career mode races. More variety and sun would've been appreciated-Not that its a problem unique to this sim but the AI still fail to take high speed corners effectively and so tracks with multiple high speed corners are too easy. -If you use braking lines, this one is alittle off. I prefer to use the real white markers, which are perfectly placed and easily visibleOverall its an above average sim for me, and its actually fun to play. Setting the AI to max and going to one of your favorite tracks actually leads to exciting battles and the motorcycles are very forgiving in what racing line you take, allowing you to have even tighter battles than you would have with cars.Note: There is a huge glitch in this game that should be forwarned before buying. If you use Steam Cloud and have more than one computer, using this game on a second computer will stop your career mode from saving -ever- again on either computer. The fix is simple enough, you just don't use Steam Cloud for this game.  ",90,9,18,18,25,1,13

												Love this game!  I keep thinking ""I haven't liked a motorcycle game this much since Superbike 2000"".  I just realized the two games had the same developer.  I'm sure there are a lot of different people at the company now, but still, it seems like there's some similar DNA between the games.I don't really understand some of people's  negativity towards this game.  I guess maybe it doesn't feel simmy enough for the sim enthusiasts, and not arcadey enough for the GRID and MX vs ATV crowd.  I, however, love the balance.  The menus are beautiful, lots of good multimedia content that gives it more life, lots of game modes, love the Moto2 and Moto3 options because MotoGP is pretty intense for a starter.  Great control/realism options (I like joint-braking and auto-tucking because I don't need THAT level of simulation).  I think the graphics are great personally.  The player models are particularly good I think, and the tracks have a lot of spectators and a good lively feel to them, although they don't quite have that GRID polish and detail, but I don't really care for that look.  This game is clean to look at and not cluttered.People have complained about the controls being unrealistic, but I don't see what the problem is.  I loved MotoGP 07 which actually felt a little too arcade-like to me, but I like this game much more now that I've tried it.  The camera is more stable and improves gameplay, and I like the way the bike responds to over-throttling it.  High-sides and low sides seem to occur reasonably, and if it were any harder or sim-like, it would be a pain to play (using a controller with joysticks will never perfectly reproduce the feel of a real motorcycle and people need to accept that.  So why not make a game reasonably PLAYABLE?  I think this game is, yet isn't a silly arcade game either).The wreck physics are a litte silly though.  You can bump into the back of people and flail around over the handlebars and easily recover.  It's easy to maliciously wreck other people too.  But reasonably trying to race among a large pack isn't impossibly difficult.  But it's a challenge.  I think the wet conditions LOOK nice in this game, but they don't seem to affect control very much at all, so that seems a little unrealistic.I tried MotoGP 14 first and my video card struggled, and it seemed glitchy as hell.  I actually prefer the cleaner look of MotoGP 13 anyway.I think Milestone did a admirable job with this game and I'm happy with my purchase.			",42,0,5,3,2,0,3

												Although at first this game appears to have rather out dated graphics I have to say it has been brilliant fun! Really you do need to know a bit about motoGP and how motorbikes work to be able to control the bike, it requires being very smooth and careful with your movements. I do wish there was some sort of practice or bike test mode so you could take your career bike out to get used to it. Other than that, great game!			",72,4,14,5,51,0,14

												MotoGP 08 was a great game, MotoGP 13 is even better and a well done, much needed revive to the series. The graphics are realistic and the racing is closer than ever in a MotoGP gameThe career mode is a nice addition and something fun to play not only for achievements but to pass time whilst waiting for a race weekend to begin.Followers of the sport will be ecstatic with this racing game despite it's cons especially after being left in the dark for the past 5 years.If I were to rate this game I'd give it an 82/100			",104,1,19,13,7,0,4

												I am a huge fan of racing games and rarely are there ever good ones, let alone motorcycle ones. I'm certainly glad I purchased this game (on sale may I add)! I've also rode a motorcycle so you can count on me being judgemental on this one.None the less great game. The user interface is easy to use with many options available. Options to change resolution can be configured before the game boots. There is a launch menu that appears with different settings. Changing controller buttons is easy and the game is very controller friendly. Some of the game mode options are instant race, grand prix, championship, career (which I'm really enjoying at the moment), multiplayer and YES!!! SPLIT SCREEN!!! <---- :) .... seriously, need more games like this on steam. Gameplay is pretty immaculate on this one. Need for Speed Shift 2 was one of my favorite racing games until I stumbled upon this. Shift gives a challenge, I feel this one does too. The AI will give you a challenge certainly when you first start, but getting a hold of the gameplay/controls  will eventually put you up front (unless you make a mistake... in which they added a feature to rewind. I've used this feature a few times watching me demolish a race because I cut a few people off). Added features are the options to have assisted steering, traction control and all that hooplah but I really like the feature where you tuck your rider into the bike. With the press of the Y button on the x-box controller, the rider tucks in obviously (too much work? Just turn it off in options and make it automatic). When taking a turn though this tiny modification can make your turn ever so smoother, and definitely a more enjoyable experience. Ever seen the guys out there racing put their knee to the ground? Well having a first person view (and even option to add a helmet HUD) delivers that experience. The friciton system also feels accurate when taking turns.  I like the controls, I like the steering, I like doing wheelees, I like being able to do stoppies, and I like to be able to drive in reverse backwards on the track and collide with other players to watch the physics system. The crash effects are pretty neat on this one, especially when you don't break enough and send another rider flying. Of course this isn't ideall; it is fun to watch the reply. All in all, the racing aspect is very apparent. My only complaint is touching the joystick ever so slightly sometimes makes the bike look like it ""jerks"", as in it's sort of quick or choppy to move a bike like that.The visuals of course are as nice as they are shown. 1980X1080 is an option with this game. The bikes look appealing and the riders are as good as they get. I'd like however a little more ability for customization when it comes to the bike or the racing suit. I'm not sure if it's only my computer (and I haven't done my research on this yet ... may edit later) but I'm having issues with cut scenes. The screen plays the scene but sometimes it does a bunch of pixelation stuff then goes back to normal. This is NOT an issue while playing the game though. I have yet to have a problem with the gameplay aspect. Side note on first person view, there are stickers on your windshield. Personally I'd like the choice to have them off. It bugs me! Seeing riders bump into one another and then react is quite neat as well. Changing gears and seeing the clutch being pulled is also a mentionable feature for motogp 13.Sound... well the sound is good because usually I keep my music on while I play games. However I find that listening to the motor while playing is helpful at least to me. In this game you have to be quite attentive or get ready to wipe out. Although the sound is decent, that's all it is. I think the sounds could have been a lot more authentic (especially from the motorcycles).I would have to highly recommend this game to anyone and would say it is a great addition to a steam library. ***I would recommend for future motogp games perhaps add a stunt bike section? I know it's not quite GP but it would add an extra depth and a few more challenges to the game. Not the mention the handling of stunt bikes would be different***. Also... for goodness sakes please make the replay interface better. Also, adding some more tracks for local co-op would be greatly appreciated! RATING : 8.2/10 Gameplay A- Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B+ Overall  BScreenShots  What it looks like when I'm not tucking into the bike One of the best aspects of the game in this screenshot - the lean The game likes to inform you of the track you're racing on, and even gives a little introductory video of the location your racing around Before the race, you may fine tune your bike in the pit Nice to see the bike is in view when looking back What career mode looks like behind the scenes.

												why so many bad reviews  {started off on the ktm 250  deano fast becomes world champion) Milestone did a great job, and I'm having a ton of fun the bike models look awesome  and the tracks are great to ride 250cc, 600cc and 900cc motorcycles are used, depending on the race I like the sound of the engines as they roar through the circuit it presents you with full seasons of the MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3 championships.Throttle management is key especially on the harder difficulties.  When you apply the accelerator after slowing down for a corner, it is necessary to gradually and smoothly increase your speed.  If you fail to do this gently, your bike will slide wide and eventually spin out In addition to steering and throttle control, you have to balance your rider appropriately for the upcoming corners.  This at first is fairly difficult, especially if you have no previous experience with motorcycle games.  On the standard setting, this is automatically done for you, and allows the player to concentrate on tackling corners The better you do in a race, the more fans are attracted to you and the better your racing team offers become You can sign with different racing teams thorough out the campaign, getting better offers the better you do in a race The tension and excitement of whipping across tarmac at high speed - feeling every bump, leaning into every corner should you shunt another rider you visibly nearly fall off and sometimes when you spin out and lose control your rider ends up with both legs on one side of the bike, struggling to balance which is a neat and realistic looking touch it  takes time to learn and master When you first boot up the game you create a custom rider and are even able to choose avatars for yourself and your managers. You get to choose things like your clothing colours and helmet and the further you get into the game the more you will unlock Milestone has included lots of driving aids such as showing the racing line, assisting with breaking and even with cornering to help newcomers to the game The lower powered bikes you begin with are much easier to get used to and feel lighter you can check current standings via a TV, change your outfit in the wardrobe, check your laptop for emails and social feeds within the pits called the Technical Meeting where you can have a conversation with the mechanic who will assess where you are having issues Once you do get to grips with things however it becomes a truly gripping, engaging and downright thrilling ride. Obviously motorbikes differ drastically to cars and the added factor of rider weight distribution makes leaner into corners at breakneck speeds, winding through S-bends and powering down the straights intensely rewarding If you want to be truly great at this game, you’ve got to put in a lot of time and effort in, but when everything clicks, it’s rewarding and worth it...............

												Seeing MotoGP13 on sale on Steam for $2.99 made me decide to take one for the team and actually play it. If you're looking for a good single player motorcycle racing game at a great price then this is it.  I played a season and a half of career mode so far, it's good fun ... there's a little bit of a difficulty curve in learning to handle the bikes but after a few races you'll start getting into the groove. I just got my first podium finish in the second race of the first season where you're actually signed to a team. The graphics are a littled dated but pretty nice, the Circuit of the Americas in Austin in particular looked really good and true to life. At this price, if you're interested in bike racing, you really can't go wrong. Unfortunately, the multi-player side of the game is no longer supported so only consider the game as a single player only experience.			",1879,710,92,183,194,22,269

												Could have been a lot better.Graphics are quite good, but all the riders look the same. Physics are quite good, but again, could be better. The game feels sloppily and quickly made. For example, there is a ""team management"" type thing after every race, where you can check emails and social feeds from other riders and team managers, but they all say the same thing every time. Utterly pointless. My other gripe is if you have a crash or slide out, others riders behind you just ride straight through you like you are a ghost, wtf? This is a very rushed game, and corners were cut everywhere. 4/10			",101,11,2,14,8,0,16

												I had been on the fence for a while now, but the 70% off sale and a friend's recommendation finally swung me to take the plunge.When it comes to racing, I'm an F1 guy through and through, so switching to this title was more than a little disorientating - but this would of course make sense. The AI are competent and the difficulty levels feel spot on. There are the usual driving assist you would expect to find in any racing titles and these can be switched on r off independently.The game runs well, even on relatively low-spec machines.My favourite part of the game thus far is the very well crafted career mode. Create your rider, enter some races as a wild card and work your way not only up teams, but up from lower racing series. This enables a rewarding progression trail to follow and a gentler learning curve which i expect will be invaluable for improving.There is a selection of managers and engineers for you to choose from to support you through your career and theres a limited fictional social media interaction with your fictional fans which ticks the egoist's authenticity box. Contract negotiations, magazines and the email system all feel useful and don't clutter you up with useless information.Another excellent addition is the ability to have sit-down meetings with your race engineer in the pits. Answer his questions about how you find the bike and he'll set up the bike for you based on your feedback - a superb feature for those who just want to race or don't have much understanding of the set-up system.Highly recommended.

												There isnt much to say about this game since its the only one (developed by Milestone) representing the MotoGP championship, besides the more modern versions (MotoGP 14 & 15), wich by the way i advise you to try after playing the 13, especially the 15 that offer big improvements in term of gameplay and graphics and may downgrade your experience with 13 since the diferences are obvious.This game suits pro or casual players since it have wide open race settings to fufill your needs (more realistic or just for fun), the game physics are good and average learning curve make easy to engage in the game, the graphics are adquate to the release year of the game and good sound to build up the mood.Keep in mind that this is a good game not only for fans but also players that dont follow MotoGP, its entertaining and challenge you to follow the best route to build your career.For the fans, possibility to drive on shoes of old legends and their 2-Stroke bikes without electronics to help you out, outstanding.

 Short evaluation by Lythronax MotoGP 13 is a kinda old MotoGP game but it's still loads of fun! Playing old titles is kind of nostalgia for me. The graphics are not that good compared to the newer titles but the camera perspective behind the bike is different and more enjoyable, in my opinion. The first person perspective is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to Ride 2 or MotoGP 14/15/16.  Conclusion: The game is funny and the singleplayer is challenging ONLY when you play with manual shifting, no helping lines and hardest AI. If you own any newer MotoGP and you don't poop money, safe your money. If you don't care about money, go buy it!			",42,3,5,4,6,0,10

												I really can recommend this game only for a big fans of MotoGP and only because there is no other option. For others it's not an option.First of all, it has some critical issues which lasts for months without fixing. You can find occasionally that your career is no longer saving or the game isn't starting. But even without this it's far from perfect. AI is too easy to beat (on some tracks even extremely easy) on the higest difficlty level (with semi-pro physics), graphics was great seven years ago, it's almost always rainig, AI has cheat lap times in qualifying and a boy, who beats everyone in Moto3 and Moto2, winning almost every race, is only welcome in CRT teams (which makes your career looks pretty strange).But if you're ok with that, go and buy it right now! In fact, you don't really have a lot of choice in moto games, do you?			",96,37,21,11,25,0,9

												First time I've bought a MotoGP game and I've been impressed. The graphics are fairly good and I enjoy having unlimited seasons in career compared to the F1 series. One problem I've had is with AI riders driving into the back of me as I brake/go in for a corner. I know this is because they can brake later/ know the corner better than me as I'm still learning but surely they should be aware enough to avoid me. It's happened many times during a race and costs me a replay that when you like playing 100% race distance are important. Still, I've really enjoyed playing so far and will probably continue to buy MotoGP games			",57,16,1,6,7,1,18

												This game is OK.  It is borderline arcade-oriented, versus a hardcore simulation - which is absolutely OK with me.  In fact, I wish it were even more so.  No amount of physics modeling is going to make the experience of a racing game truly comparable to real life, so I believe it is much better to focus on fun and presentation.  In terms of presentation, the game is already quite attractive.  The pavement looks just right, the environments look close enough to the real tracks that I can't find faults, and the game has absolutely no pop-in artifacts.  What it really needs, though, is some quality voice-over and overlay work.  The most spectacular thing about modern NBA and NFL games, for me, is that the casters and screen overlays make gameplay look like televised events.  Upgrading this game to do the same would probably elevate it to greatness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first Moto GP game I've bought for a while, I've had most of the early games 07 being my favourite with Moto GP 4 on PS2 my second favourite.The newest one I had previously was Moto GP 10 on the 360 which was way too arcady and required less skill to play properly than previous games so I lost interest in the series.As this game was on offer for £2.24 I thought I would give it a go.  Straight away I set everything to realistic and difficulty on max removing racing lines etc.  I started a Moto 3 career as myself and with the difficulty being so high the rewind button is a definate help as you won't get back in touch with riders once you fall off.  Limiting it to 6 rewinds in fair, I usually do 25% race distance so have the option of one per lap.So far 10 ten races into my first season I've had a 5th place best finish, nobody lets you win which I like.   Setting the bike up takes a bit of thought, the technical adviser will undo good settings if you use him too much so best to sort it yourself and save the data as it will get altered when you come to the next session sometimes.I like the way you can switch teams mid season and set targets of certain riders to beat so even if you are not battling for the win it's worth playing.  You can also adjust traction control setting while riding which is handy as conditions sometimes change during the race.The only criticism I have is that on the highest difficulty it is almost impossible to qualify much higher than last place despite overtaking people through most of the qualifying sessions.  Also I can carve my way close to the top ten within a lap and have been holding 4th postion for 5 laps of a race so I definately have the pace.   That said I've not played a racing game for 2 years so am re learning the tracks as I go so maybe my qualifying will improve next season and I'm just picking the best lines from following in the races.I highly recommend this game for it's playability and realism (I have raced a motorcycle in real life).  To give you an idea I have listed how I rate the Moto GP games I've played in order of how good they were.Moto Gp 13 - PCMoto Gp 07 - PC & Xbox 360Moto GP 4 - PS2Moto GP 06 - Xbox 360Moto GP 3 - PS2Moto GP - XboxMoto GP 10 - Xbox 360 ( don't bother)			",0,0,1,3,1,0,5

												Overall a good game for the price.. Can only find one bad point, which is when the rider leans from one position to the other, it's really slow and very annoying especially when you have to take tight corners			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game in progress. I would still recommend this game despite of having issues because of console port.Pros:* Career mode start being as Moto3 rider and witness to climb up to MotoGP* A lot of options for the race for both casual and pro gamingCons:* Career mode has a lot of rainy race than clear/cloudy race in my opinion it doesn't happen in real life* Performance hit using FSAA Anti-aliasing, better to avoid using it* Performance cap at 30 FPS when VSync is on, unable to override it using NVidia control panel.

												As a complete newcomer to MotoGP as a sport and a game I was very surprised at how fun it is. The riding aids help a lot at the beginning and can be disabled step by step as you become more comfortable with the controls. Riding in general feels great, there is a special thrill to be had from riding at the very limit of your bike's abilites and shaving fractions of seconds off lap times. Other than trainings and qualifyings, the races pose a different challenge as you don't just battle with the track, but with other riders too. On most difficulty settings you can just ride off and win by a landslide, but on the higher difficulties the opponents can become quite hard to beat and the occasional duels that can last multiple laps are some of the high points of this game. Also it's worth noting that the opponent AI is surprisingly solid as they're reasonably good at avoiding crashes and giving eachother (and the player) space where needed. The graphics hold up pretty well, the tracks have their own distinct looks and there are some nice little details here and there. Some parts of the game lack a little depth, like the commentary at the end of sessions that repeats itself a lot or the rather repetitive and unimportant social feeds, but no part of this game is actually broken or dysfunctional and the underdeveloped parts are limited in a kind of charming way instead of being annoying.This gets an easy recommendation from me if you like no-frills bike racing or racing in general.

												As far as it goes i think this game is all the more recomandable if you're a fan of motogp or simply motorcycles in general. Overall riding feels realistic and compelling. It is true that only a small amounts of the technical aspects of the game alone would possibly make you fall for it .. there are indeed numerous glitches and the textures and polygons seem somehow dated (graphic engine of WRC3 supposedly .. takes us back quite a few years that is .. ) the sound of engines is ok with the music generally being a lame worthless ♥♥♥♥♥ (for all i care it could get even worse since it doesn't seriously damage the game experience in itself .. you can always mute it but hell i thought it was maybe something I had to mention anyways) YET the difficulty is challenging to say the least and the pro rider settings will require a bunch of hours of practicing before you can even start hoping to take the lead in any of the major events but what a thrill once you're starting to feel like you're part of the race for broke!! One more interesting thing : everything is official licence here : real motogp tracks of course but real star riders, real  equipment, real bikes .. IT IS THE REAL DEAL .. hopefuly we'll get patches, fixes and updates soon enough because if the looks are barely alright (i recall NFS Shift 2 : Unleashed had better looks overall .. and it's no less than two years older a game in comparison!!) one can feel there's been some dedication and clever work in the making of this game.

												Do I think this is a good game? In some respects, yes. The bikes are fairly hard to handle as you move up the classes (as it should be) and the tracks are actually kinda fun. However, they need to put the difficultly up to a point where you're doing well to be midfield on a midfeild bike. The AI drops around 1.5-2 seconds in race trim, while yourself can keep the same laptimes. Takes away from a lot of good battles. Frustratingly, in the wet, the game is horrible. No realism, too much grip (even on pro mode) and not enough sliding. Ruins all the positive points.			",0,0,2,0,4,0,1

												As of 2016-06-26 the game has been patched really well; it looks great and plays great, even on my Medium PC.I've already played through the game on console but re-bought it for my PC during a sale. The game is exactly the same except that it looks better on PC as I can crank up the settings, and it seems to have been patched better as well.The bike physics is not as sim-like as in Milestone's own SBK games, it doesn't demand the same technical mastery. However the physics is still challenging enough to be enjoyable, especially if you decrease the TCS.There's a tonne of content in this game, even without the DLCs. The replay value is extremely high considering just how many manufacturers and models there are, where every single bike model handles differently from the others. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm disappointedI bought this game for playing with a friend who can't afford a new gen pc, so these are the kind of games that he can run, tried to join multiplayer, based on raknet, where i can succesfully sign in, i can see his room in mp mode but can't join; both of us have done the port forwarding as the devs said in an announcement but didn't work.In the store page the multiplayer option is tagged, they should remove itEDIT: i saw some Steam reviews and it seems that mp never worked properly.Anyway, the game has nice graphics for the 2013, i like the gameplay and the career mode, you can change some options to make the game more arcade or simulation oriented, if you want to play SP you should buy it.I gave it a negative review because of the online, but playing i realised that it deserves a positive one.Vote 7/10			",91,12,23,1,12,0,6

												Decent bike-racing game for PC.There aren't many to choose from but this does the job.It's not brilliant (graphics aren't that good, sounds are rather bland) but it does have bike handling considerable well handled.Remove the assistances to get proper ""feel"" for the bike, otherwise you can't really drive the way you should: handling is awkward and off-balance when assists are enabled.If you are into motorbikes you might like this as well. It's not epic but suitable for people into racing and motorsports. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really enjoyed learning on the moto3 class. then progressing to the moto2 (still my fovorite because of the screaming 600cc engine and handling) After that I have just gotten better and better. The physics are very good and I havent played motogp 14-16 because I'm still mastering this baby. I will get 15 when it goes on sale :)  ",81,2,8,6,3,0,0

This game isn’t even realistic to how a motorcycle reacts. I got this game for 5 bucks and 5 bucks is nothing. This game isn’t even worth 5 bucks they should pay me to play this game again.

I don't know why, but the bike skidding too much. So despite all the negative comments, bugs, & all the minus of MotoGP 14, MotoGP 14 is still the best!

Yes the game made by the same company 5 years ago had better visuals, audio, gameplay, simulation... it even had better controller feedback.The 1 thing that this game does better then other MotoGP games is the near crash/saves animations but seriously feels like that was all they spent their time on as everything else was comparable to motorbike games of 8 years agouhh hope they step it up for 14...

In fact what it actually reminded me of was a sound my OLD acorn electron used to make when I was playing Mars Lander (written in BASIC, by hand, one rainy Sunday afternoon) way back in around oh, say 1980! As for the rest, good physics but yeah, presentation killed it for me after only 37 minutes of playing, I just couldn't deal with it...........it looks NOTHING like the screenshots and they aren't that flas for a game that's only 2 years old!

I don't usually  put much store in reviews as they are always subjective and based upon the individuals experience, likes, dislikes, skill level etc.  However, I wish I had taken notice of all the negative reviews on this one.  Clearly the console version has been given all the development funding and the PC version left to rot and just there as a token gesture.  graphics were better on my Amiga (may be pushing it s bit) but clearly not designed around PC Platform, mouse doesn't work as you would expect on menus etc. it is just horrid.

MotoGP 13 however I would say is the best motocycle game I have ever played.  It has a perfect blend of  realism and fun factor.  I would compare it the forza franchise.  Incredibly realisitic and accurate physics.  The game is simply perfect.  It's soo wonderful to finally see a motorcycle game finally get it right.  The game also captures the badassness of the fact you are racing with the worlds best riders on the fastest machines.  The game is perfect!!			",58,1,2,7,1,0,22

												I love it...obviously^^^Sure wish I would have waited 2 weeks to buy it though(when it was temporarily on sale for $12.99). Not that I'm complaining about paying full price for it. It's still worth every penny I paid in my book. But what a STEAL that would have been to only pay  $13!!!Oh well. Like I always say. When my ship came in, I was at the airport. DOH!

												motogp 13 is a mix of both you love it and you dont. first ride on any bike in the game is tough, hard and irritating. But when you master it it feels great. The first season is fun, you progress and progress and keep at it all to race in the motogp class. But when youve done that milestone, there is nothing else to do. Doing the same tracks against the same people over and over gets boring and irritating, if you love motogp you will like this game, if you have a slight interest you will get bored after a bit.

												Such a great game for a great Racing seriesNice grafics and a soft and comfort handling. It would be nice if the splitsreen mode worked easier and the online mode worked general, but otherwise it's a great racing game and I have many hope's for the 2014 title.So if the game stand's on 50 % buy it :D :D			",140,16,32,6,40,6,16

												I auctualy ride, and feel the designers of this game have never even seen a real motorcycle before, otherwise they may have been able to make it auctualy handle like a real one. These bikes have no ability to turn, and you will spend more time on the ground then in the seat. the visuals will feel like your going maybe 10mph at most, and should be able to take a corner fine, but the speedo sais something like 130kph, and you will lay down the bike in almost every corner. WTF?!? I bought this game a few months back when it was on sale for about 3$, I finally was able to take a few minutes to play it. and spent most of the time trying to set up the bike to auctualy be able to take a turn. I regret even spending the 3$ on this pile of garbage. I played this searies Way back when i was a kid, I think their first or second game. And I remember having a blast playing it then, I guess they just lost their touch. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! it is a complete waste of money. I wish Steam had a refund program that went further back then a few weeks.			",75,7,7,9,8,1,8

												Game crashes at track loading screen. researched the problem as much as I could and could not come up with any solution other than disabling audio, which playing a videogame without audio seems totally stupid. I am running Windows 10 with all current drivers and the high-end Nvidia graphics card. All of my specifications exceeded even the recommended level for this game. It simply would not work once you got to the track loading screen. To make matters even worse you cannot control alt delete to get out of this. I had to actually log out or force a hard power restart. With such little information regarding this problem and how to fix it I cannot in good faith recommend this game though it seems like it would be a very good one if I could get past this issue. I will likely be asking for a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Worst game ever... Basically the same as all the other motorcycle games where you can't control you're lean angle. You just CAN'T steer the bike properly due to the way the game is setup (no manual control over this either!) I have tried KB, game pad (Logitech rumblepad II) and a wheel. Nothing can overcome the lack of steering control. The issue is... When cornering, your either on full lean angle or no lean angle.. Nothing in between is controlable, so holding the racing line or any line for that matter is impossible. Basically it's like driving a car around any angle of corner with either no steering lock OR full steering lock to choose from!The game is impossible to exit too, you MUST finish your race before being allowed to exit. I needed to restart my computer on each occasion to exit the game fully. My computer is a top end self built machines and has no issues with any other programs including all the others in my 400GB+ Steam folder.Wish I hadn't wasted the £9 on the special offer now!

												I had been on the fence for a while now, but the 70% off sale and a friend's recommendation finally swung me to take the plunge.When it comes to racing, I'm an F1 guy through and through, so switching to this title was more than a little disorientating - but this would of course make sense. The AI are competent and the difficulty levels feel spot on. There are the usual driving assist you would expect to find in any racing titles and these can be switched on r off independently.The game runs well, even on relatively low-spec machines.My favourite part of the game thus far is the very well crafted career mode. Create your rider, enter some races as a wild card and work your way not only up teams, but up from lower racing series. This enables a rewarding progression trail to follow and a gentler learning curve which i expect will be invaluable for improving.There is a selection of managers and engineers for you to choose from to support you through your career and theres a limited fictional social media interaction with your fictional fans which ticks the egoist's authenticity box. Contract negotiations, magazines and the email system all feel useful and don't clutter you up with useless information.Another excellent addition is the ability to have sit-down meetings with your race engineer in the pits. Answer his questions about how you find the bike and he'll set up the bike for you based on your feedback - a superb feature for those who just want to race or don't have much understanding of the set-up system.Highly recommended.

												This is by far the worst game I have ever played there is no tutorial, you can only select items with arrow keys and enter. The controls are strewn through the entire key board and I couldn't even get 30 seconds into a race before the game crashed. On start up the controls we're broken and everything went wrong. But by far a complete waste of money and time. You'd be better off playing bear simulator.			",18,1,1,4,3,0,0
