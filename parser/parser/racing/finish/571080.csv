												I gave it a thumbs down before and I think it's getting to the point of being worthy of a thumbs up as some of the things I had issues with have been fixed.It's getting a lot better, making the racing line visible through the buildings (or a lot more visible perhaps?) makes it a lot easier to see where you need to go.The wall crashing's a lot better, you do still get stuck a bit though if you throttle up to try to go forward, the wing hits the wall and steers you into it again...an easy solution would prob. be to just add a front wing as it'd make the nose stay in a straighter direction. (reversing takes longer than simply floring it to bounce out so it's not really an option eitherIt feels like you increased the difficulty too as I did grab a bronze before and now my closest time is about 1 sec. off on one of the easiest tracks, that I never did play a lot of the similar games way back when doesn't help of course. (I am also a hood view type of gamer which also handicaps me a bit)Overall it's been improved quite a lot and I'll keep it installed and see how things move along occassionally.
