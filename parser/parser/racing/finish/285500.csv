												Ok, I have to say that I really like this game.  It's very similar to the Wing Commander : Privateer model of a golden path where you have an open world, horizontal gameplay and character development with a game story waiting for you to follow it.  There's trading, truck upgrades, modular weapons, towns, factions, and an open world map to boot.  The graphics are 2006-ish but if you're looking for gameplay, you can look past that.The vehicles themselves are based around chassis that have stats but each chassis also has multiple front and back body components which different turret / upgrade / cargo slots.   Not all weapon slots are 360 degrees which adds a positional element to combat.The game won't work out of the box for Windows 7.  You have to delete the videos in your Steam\SteamApps\common\Hard Truck Apocalypse\data\video directory.			",266,40,1,61,45,1,39

												Hell it's about time...Before you trolls B***h about poor voice acting and everything being too brown. you know what you guys just leave the room right now. They gone? Okay. Now if you ever wanted to be the freighter getting attacked by pirates only with buggys and you're driving a truck with optional shotgun turrets, heavy armor and no Tom Hanks. this is it.    In the end this game deserves to be on Steam. Enjoy.			",251,9,5,18,33,0,52

												Now, I can't say this is alike any game that most people know- for it certainly isn't. It's like a mix of Twisted Metal, Fallout, and Mad-Max style combat with a huge amount of cheesey- and probably bad- translations. It's a Russian game with dated graphics and a decently written story. It's a tale of revenge, messenger-like objectives, and mystery. The lore is actually really complex, and there are some side quests you can take more than the random Bartender mission. Yeah, those guys give you random missions that help early game but are wastes of time in later game due to the prices. Now, I find it funny that every character wears a Ghost-of-the-opera-esque mask, and lore-wise they explain they're basically a more ornate and compacted Gas mask. I think they made them because they didn't want to have to animate faces, haha. Voice acting is absurd in English; so you may want to just play it in the original Russian with subtitles. This game still has its problems. Pros:-Excellent Story and Lore-Wonderful control system; works pretty well and can be re-assigned if need be. -Interesting Mechanics- Fuel is a thing, tons of truck upgrades, pretty unique storage system.-Design of the trucks looks amazing; You even get monstrosities that are crosses between monstertrucks and tanks, wield five guns at once, and guzzle gas faster than five hummers from an oil tank that must be the size of a pond.-A few hillarious glitches: Pedestrians walk into your truck during cutscenes and splat with a noise like a bug, grass floats, that sort of thing.Cons:-Dated Graphics; it's an old game, but that can be looked over.-A few major glitches; One game breaking one stopped me from palying for nearly a year until I found a guide. Careful when you get to the oil shiping mission in the desert. -Gets boring at times- you'll spend sometimes an hour or more crossing over three regions that you've cleared before, one-shotting the old enemies and getting worthless crap. -AI can be a bit of an idiot at times; crashs into enemies, drives off of cliffs, gets stuck on debris. All in all, I would suggest this game. It's enjoyable and very, very unique- plus it gives me a laugh every now and then, even if it wasn't intended. I'm pretty sure they weren't; but it's funny when a bandit yells something nonsensical anyways. If you want a game of strange bandits, amazing truck combat, massive- and sometimes excellent- landscapes, amazing story, and silly translations, BUY THIS GAME. It's worth it.			",87,21,10,4,5,0,1

												There are a lot of games on Steam, but once in a while, you browse the catalogue and discover a little gem hiding somewhere in the deep ends of the underated section. Ex Machina is one of those games, but let me start off by saying that this game certainly isn't for everyone, it's genre is considered to be a very acquired taste, but I would say it's worth the buy anyway just for the sake of trying it. I didn't expect it to be anything amazing given it's lack of popularity, but I was wrong, this game is truly brilliant. If by some coincidence you were attracted to this game because you are a fan of Takara's Road Trip Adventure or Seek & Destroy (otherwise known as the ChoroQ games) like me, then you definitely shouldn't miss out on this, it brings the best of both of those Worlds together!Ex Machina is about the young protagonist searching for lots of answers & vengeance, depending on the story options you go along with, in a post apocalyptic representation of north America. You start off with one of the weaker vehicles in the game but are given the oportunity to work your way up the ladder by getting coins for doing jobs or selling loot and scrap to people and villages thus giving you the chance to buy new vehicles or upgrade your existing one. Sell the dropped weapons of the enemy, use the money to buy yourself a bigger, better one! The game starts off a little bit slow, but the pace picks up over the course of the game. Not much else can be said without giving away spoilers, but the story can be very extensive depending on what choices you make during your experience, this is something I really enjoy about Ex Machina, that there isn't just one set plot but rather multiple different routes and storylines that can occur. The game has it's quirks, in fact, it is a very quirky game, it also has some minor annoyances such as some spelling and grammatical mistakes (this is due to the original version of the game being Russian resulting in a bad translation). The voice acting leaves much to be desired and the dialog is sometimes far from brilliant, but this game really does a lot more things right than it does wrong. The open world, the long story with alternate endings and plots, tons of optional quests, upgrades and weapon variety are something many games in this day and age can learn from. It really is a shame that this game doesn't have a very large community because it really is wonderful, even if it has somewhat dated graphics. There is also no warp function, meaning you have to drive to everywhere you need to go rather than magically appearing there with the click of a button, this can sometimes be tedious but is also another great addition to this open world game. If you've been watching this, I highly recommend giving it a go, I can't promise you will enjoy it because as I said above, it definitely isn't for everybody, but it is certainly something unique. Some of the reviews on here and the ""expert"" reviews on other sites seem to be by people who tried the game for all of 20 minutes and decided to stop playing for some reason or other as they never go into any detail as to why they gave negative reviews, so I think rather than thinking twice because of what those people had to say, you should just ultimately see for yourself. That's what I did, I have no regrets.Please do read some reviews however as it seems that this game has some trouble functioning on certain systems. I am running Windows 8 and the game runs flawlessly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, after long years of being a huge fan of this game, I finally finished it (I had an original Russian actual version released by Buka company).My feelings are mixed. I'd like to point out some pros and cons for the game, and you guys will judge for yourself.I solemnly swear to keep it spoiler-free for those who still hasn't finished it.Pros:* A pseudo open world to explore. Due to some scripted restrictions you cannot simly go to, say, Vaterland from Krai. But it doens't mean that actual exploration is not fun and to some extent rewarding.* A variety of trucks to choose from with a great deal of customization. I love all of them, except for maybe Belaz since I didin't touch it at all.* A wide variety of weapons to satisfy anyone's taste, from machine guns to plasma cannons.* Lovely soundtrack and visuals. A bit outdated, but the game is almost a decade old! Explosions and energy particles tho.* The narrative in terms of lore. Just read the in-game books.Cons:* Extremely poor narrative. Both from the point of telling a story and the story itself. I dunno, maybe it's just those Masks that make every character to look the same way? Or voice acting? Or the final which is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT?* A dumb AI. More in a matter of path-finding than fighting. Extremely stupid! Sometimes a bunch of trucks cannot make it through a hill because instead of driving around they try to come over it.* Not really much stuff to do aside from some interesting side quests now and then.*  The final boss battle. A huge disappointment also. No spoilers!* Dialogue is just a stub. I understand that in such a mission there need to be less talk and more action but damn! I felt sorry for coming to Ben's place and leaving the same instance without even saying good bye. No love for the old guy.* Restrictions on where to go and what to do. Try to cross that river in Vaterland. Just go and do it.* Some things are just unnecessary. For example, some inter-regional shortcuts. I never used them and have a feeling that never will. Sad but true.CONLUSION: This game has it's flaws, and narrative leaves a nasty touch on my tongue. But I still love this game. For the sense of freedom that it managed to give to me despite all those restrictions to go where I want. For the atmosphere of post-apocalyptic road to nowhere. You just go where the wind blows. I just wish I could dive into this world a bit more, leaving all that main storyline somewhere on the side. Actually, a sandbox open-world RPG in HTA setting would be much appreciated and would become a must-have in my collection. Maybe with some neat multiplayer like it was, say, in Freelancer? I don't know, and probably will never know.Anyway, that's my review. Still love this game and recommend it to everyone interested. Give this game a try.			",97,19,0,9,8,0,27

												I am going to start with a CAVEAT: To make this game work you WILL have to download a Russian 3rd-party patch/launcher, and if you want to play in a custom HD resolution (I play at 2560x1440), you WILL have to edit the config file (not that hard). If you are prepared for that, then please continue reading... or better yet, just BUY the thing already. It's a great game! If not, then unfortuneately it will never work for you and your money would be best spent somewhere else. There WILL be an MMO version of this game by the same developers, and it's currently going through early beta testing. If you don't want to have to mess with (Russian) files and rather play with your friends, just wait for that game to come out, because this is a different experience and requires a bit of effort on your end to make it work.Now more about this game: This game is awesome... and it was heart-breaking when I had crash after crash on my Windows 8.1 setup. It's a very simple game I hear being compared to the original Elite, but on land in a post apocalyptic world setting. It has a bit of a mixed steam-punk and post-apocalyptic feeling I get from this game, but it does so in a sort of charming way without the typical zombies and gore.Now here is the thing, I had to start over soooo many times because my saves would not load after a while and then I had to try play it mostly with Steam off by launching it from the game directory... it all failed sooner or later. Why do I still recommend it now? Well, if you go to the Discussions of the Steam Community for this game, there is a Russian launcher/patch you can download specifically for this game to run on Windows 7/8 (from a Sticky thread). IT WORKS! After ignoring this game for almost a year, I was able to finally load my most recent save and it loaded and played beautifully! Yes, the graphics are a bit old, yes, there are still some glitches, the physics are non-existent, and the game is just simple to play with no base/station building or recruiting anybody... but is that a bad thing? The world maps are large, they are all tied together interestingly (and need to be fully explored to find interesting stuff/missions), trading generally works, and the wonderful trucks just plain look incredible. Unlike a lot of today's games, this one has a certain charm to it that I have not been able to find in any other game since I attempted to play this one originally. Well, to me it's still a lot of fun, and it offers a challenge, especially in the beginning before you learn that you are not that tough compared to what's roaming around out there. From my understanding, there are plenty of these sorts of ""learning moments"" through-out the game.As a plus, it's NOT an MMO for a change! It's an honest-to-goodness single-player game in which you don't have to deal with greifers, and online connection, or a bunch of other hoopla you typically have with modern games.If you are looking for a fun and simple vehicle-based RPG combat/trading game, then this game is for you... IF you can literally download a 3rd-party patch and edit the config for your resolution. If not, then please just move on. Most of the negative reviews are about the lack of stability when the game itself is actually very fun when it works... it's a shame, if it was not for the horrible support for this game, I feel like this could have been a massive and very popular franchise.UPDATE: As an update after I left this review and added 17 more hours to the Steam-recorded time... I had literally 2 crashes over the course of this time with the new 3rd party patch/launcher. Once it crashed when I tried alt+tabbing out of the game (I have alt-tabbed MANY times over 17+ hours, it only crashed once), and another time when I used F12 to try to make a Steam screenshot. It has run flawlessly for the remainder of the time. No issues loading saved games, no game-breaking glitches, just fun in the sun in my giant trucks! :DUPDATE #2: Had maybe 2 more odd crashes, but have a solid 30 hours of game time (from what is clocked on Steam) and getting close to the end (just finished the Oracle quest thing and looking for the second disc). The game is getting a little repetitive at times, but new maps look cool, and I still like the exploration aspect and doing missions even though I have more money than I can possibly spend. Still think it's a wonderful Elite-type game that I wish more people gave a chance to. The newish community patch in the Steam Discussions for this game makes this game work great. It's obviously an older game, it's not perfect, but it's unique... and now it actually runs!			",368,86,25,36,62,1,82

												Actually pretty good, especially at the price. Some minor bugs, and a few major ones, but good music and the gameplay is mostly solid. The localization is a bit flawed, but mostly understandable.I say mostly a lot because there are a few things, but given the state of games released even today they are simply par for the course. If you are playing in windows 7 or 8 check the forums as there is an issue with the intro videos playing and you need to delete them from within the game data folder.Overall a sometimes frustrating but ultimatly enjoyable experience.

												Okay i will start with the good things, Good selection of trucks (with a few cabs and body choices to make each unique), Weapons alot with many types in each size such as a 2x2 gun or lazer that can only be equipped in a 2x2 slot or a 3x4 cannon that belongs in a 3x4 slot, This game works well everything has a size and rearranging the inventory to fit enough loot to sell at the next town is easy to do. The voice acting is bad but in a good way. And the story is good and makes for a good reason to keep playing. The battles are fun even if the enimies seem to constantly come at you or just don't spawn for ages... But onto the bad things... Bugs, Crashes, Glitches, Graphics, Try to think of something bad... Yep this game has that i have windows 7 so i get the black screen at the start i got past it by hitting escape. Then after palying through the first area crash #1 so i deleted the videos in the local files. now the game works fine. The few crashes i have had since have been during loading screens so save before leaving areas. AND SAVE OFTEN. With many files so you can load back a few if needed.Towards the end of the game some of the battles just got stupid i could shoot for ages and do so little and take heaps of damage at the same time. I love this type of game but the lack of info on the web the bugs and the fact steam seems like they never tested it makes it a wary buy. 6/10 includiing issues 9/10 gameplay wise.EDIT: When i played through it the trading cards were not out now they are. Also about 2 weeks after i beat it i replayed made a different choice in a mission and the whole campaign was different. great game if you can get it to work. 10/10EDIT: Well i have to go back thru and play for the cards now. I don't mind but i did just buy the other hard truck game. Still not a bad thing love the game. Hoping for a remake/sequal.			",96,11,8,15,11,0,11

Hard Truck Apocalypse is the first Elite-type trading game I really had fun with. Because it is endearingly simple. (Space) trading games usually come with a billion of planets, try to awe you with a world full of ""possibilities"". I, personally, find these cold worlds intimidating, their space stations and gas clouds and futuristic ores. And their six axis control terror. I'm not made for dogfights.HTA, on the other hand, is a sandy game of browns and yellows and the main music whilst driving is a cute little country tune. (Which gets old fast, but anyway.) And the map is more neat than huge. But that's okay!So there's a story about people that look like really cool, anaemic 3D puppets, but mostly you drive from A to B, deliver stuff and ""bandits"" will attack you inbetween and you gun them away with WASD and a mouse-controlled baby turret on your truck. Which is fully customizable. It all works alright.I think that's the game. It doesn't need more. Yeah, sometimes, the colour palette is a little too friendly, there's nothing obviously ""gritty"" here. In a way, that's pretty realistic. If you lived in a world like this, this is what it would feel like, you wouldn't have a high contrast filter on your eyes or vignetted sight.Playing Hard Truck Apocalypse is like driving through the German federal states of Brandenburg or Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the apocalypse is alreading taking place these days - abandoned villages, peaceful lakes, people doing odd jobs for nothing.

												Hard Truck: Apocalypse takes an interesting premise and strips away all but the most mundane elements, leaving you to drive down a long and unexciting road to nowhere.Most of the trucks ride like they should be carting oranges or vending-machine refills, instead of chasing bandits. Pushing them down the road with a keyboard ain't much fun—and driving eats up almost all of your playing time.The more interesting large-scale fire fights and planning truck upgrades provide some reasons to stick with it, along with nostalgia for dear old Interstate 76. If only Targem had concentrated on lending the missions more of the depth I76's sported, the other faults would be far more forgivable.The vast world with bandits and weapon-packed vehicles is an interesting idea, but being forced to meander back and forth across it just to earn a few scraps of cash makes the whole thing boring.Its gameplay isn't imaginative or original, but if you're looking for a quick fix of destructiveness, Apocalypse gets the job done. Overall 5/10.			",2249,864,87,235,309,22,348

												this game at first i didn't really like it because of the graphics mainly but after a few hours and learning the controls, i started to like it and the story line since that bad at all, the best i can say the game is cheap so who cares if you like or not, because personally i don't read any commit that doesn't have at less 20 hours or game play because 9 times out of 10 its just someone that wants to say something not nice about something and that is the normal for them on a computer. Over all i enjoyed the game you have to repair your truck upgrade it and even make money and do side mission so you can pay for your upgrades and if you do get this game my advice is not leave the area map of each area until you get the best stuff or you will find the game a little hard to beat.

												If you like car-based post-apocalypse and don't afraid of slightly old graphics - this game is for you! Customize your car, fight against road bandits, scavenge goods to sell it in the town shops - everything for the real Road Warrior! As the old game, it's pretty hardcore (but not really hard)- no chackpoints, health regen, fast trevel, or other casual (poser) stuff! Damaged in battle - repeir for money, died  - load game. But you can save in evevery game moment, even in the middle of a fight!Fun gemeplay and It also has a pretty good story.The second one (""rise of clans"") is good too - it's pretty mutch the same, but with some improvements (more cars, customizations, and so).I recommend both of these games - it's worth money!

												It sounds like such a simple question.  ""Do you recommend this game?""  But every now and then a game comes along that makes you really have to think about that.  This is one of those games.It is a budget title.  A game that is massively flawed, but functional.  There are bugs, ranging from invisible walls in the middle of the map, floating grass, options such as reversing your mouse’s y-axis not saving when you exit the game, to the game not exiting properly, crashing, and not working on Windows 7 or higher without some tweaking.  There are bugs.  You will encounter them.The game, originally Russian, has some problems in the translation.  Voice acting for the main character is flat.  He calls out things like “The roof is on fire!” when he spots enemies.  There are several more non-sequiturs in the game.  The story is fairly generic, limited.  However, it does branch out, letting you choose different factions to support during the game.The game is not polished.  Your vehicle can climb mountains with ease, physics are described as ‘bouncy’.  To explain why all the characters’ faces don’t move, the creators decreed that all the characters wear masks (and, yes, the graphics reflect that).But the gameplay is there.  You can drive around.  You can enter combat, with a variety of weapons.  Vehicles are done in a fairly strict upgrade process.  One chassis is better than another, one cab is better in nearly all stats and slots than another, same with beds.  Even with combat, some weapons are clearly better than nearly anything else in their slot (shotguns, particularly the medium shotgun, are fairly over powered compared to other available weapons).You can raid, you can trade, haul cargo, complete quests.  You can finish the game.  It is not without flaws, but it is not without charm.  There are problems with AI spawn rates, where enemies will attack in rapid succession outside of a town, leading you into a loop of defending yourself, looting the scraps, returning to sell and repair, and then being attacks again right away.  Other times, you will not see an enemy for several maps if you run through them.  Yet the game also contains some clever fights (and some generic ones).The first map perfectly introduces you to how to play.  The next string of maps seems to follow the trope of “they get worse as you go on, because fewer and fewer people will see them”, but began to improve again in time.  You do eventually see different environments from what most of the early game looks like.This is a game that doesn’t feel done, but does feel like the devs had a clear idea of what they were trying to achieve.  And, gameplay wise, it is solid.  And it is fun, if that’s what you want.   So, in the end, do I recommend this game?  Yes, I think I do, if that is the kind of game you’re looking for, and if you can look past its many flaws.  But this game won’t appeal to everyone.			",646,192,15,85,65,6,121

If you can disregard the dated graphics (It's an old game after all) and like Fallout or the vehicular combat of Mad Max or Twisted Metal, I'd say give it a shot.Oh, and it has voiceacting on the level of the original Resident Evil, so if you enjoy that cringy as hell ""so bad it's good"" voiceacting, you'll be quite pleased with this game.

												If you can see past the dated graphics and stilted english then this game is an absolute gem!  I must admit I love cruising around in my modded truck blowing the absolute **** out of bandits.  It takes a little while to get going but once you get to at least your third class of truck, things get really fun.Pros;- Awesome soundtrack- Loads of mods and weapons to chose from- Decent trading system between towns- Large maps to explore- Loads of side quests- Funny dialogueCons;- Funny dialogue and stilted mission/story- Invisible barriers on mountains- No auto-save- Some long back and forth missionsYou can get the general gist of what is going on, but the poor conversion to english (which can be quite funny at times) can detract from the experience.  Otherwise this is a solid game that is fun with an awesome soundtrack.  I would definately buy this game again if they were to ever improve the graphics and perhaps throw in a few more truck classes.			",51,9,1,8,1,0,14

												All throughout this review, remember, this game is 10 years old!Now, on to the good stuffPros:-Oddly calming music-Voice acting that is so BAD, that its good. Comical even. Like the main character's dead-pan reading of his father's death.-Fun combat-Has trading cardsCons:-The starting just is just TOO SLOW. Or, the towns are all too far apart... maybe a little of both. I just felt like I was playing Euro Truck simulator for a lot of it. Driving a giant, slow truck through acres of nothing.-Rewards are tiny, which makes it hard to upgrade to more fun weapons and vehicles. I spent a lot of my earnings on repairs, and that was on easy mode.-Story is... not riveting, at least not as far as I got. Even though I listed voice acting as a funny pro, the downside is that its hard to get pulled in with bad dialog and voice acting.-Trading system seemed clunky and obtuse.-No achievements. This game could have really benefited from achievements.-Graphics are clearly aged, can't blame the game, its old, but I had to list it.Overall, if you take its age into consideration, I'd give the game a 7/10. Back in 2005, on the Playstation 2, I would've been playing this game. However, in the here-and-now (2015), with almost 1300 games in my library, this game is on the back, BACK burner. If you have a slow, old PC or have nothing else to play, then I'd say go for it. Or maybe for the laughs, or nostalgia.*Disclaimer: I recieved a free copy of this game from the developer in order to review it.			",897,378,14,93,72,4,121

												Ok,after a week or so,I finally finished playing this game and i have a few things to tell about this game.I'll start with what's good and what's bad at this game.Pro:*Custom trucks/map/difficulty/economy/Gameplay.-The ability to change the type of weapons you have on your truck makes it so you can adapt to any enemy.-You can change how the trucks look,from painting the truck to changing/upgrading it-Map:The area you will explore,is big and it should keep you busy for a long time-Difficulty:this game even at normal is pretty challenging(you will really need to manage the resources you find on the map)-Economy:you will find different resources throught the game,each of these resources will sell at different prices.(some cities will give 10000$ for an electric board and other will offer you 50000$)-Gameplay wise this game is good but a bit repetitive.Cons: *Acting/bugs/performance isuses.-Acting:Lets say if this game would have been an actor,it wouldn't win an Oscar-Bugs:There are lots of them but mostly graphical ones,the only place i encountered a bug that required me to reload a current save,was in the area,called Vahat,to be exactly,the city ""KEF"".(lets say if you meet a guy Called Mario exit the city,save,and then talk with him,if he changes your truck,your good if he dosen't keep trying)-Performance:While the game runs great it has a problem with the resolution and also lacks V-sync.You can get around these issues by:1:Going to Nvidia Control Panel/AtiCatalyst driver and force V-sync on the game(Google is your friend)2:To fix the Resolution you will need to Find the Confing.cfg file and open it with notepad,after that you need to search for these exact lines: r_width=""1366"" and r_height=""768""(use the find next function provided by notepad itself to find them easyer) and change the number with whatever resolution you have.You may have noticed i didn't say anything about the graphics,well...the game was made in 2006,so what do you expect?So my final opinion is this:If you find this game at a Weeklong deal or a Today's deal,buy it.The reason i say this,is because the of the amount of trouble you need to go through,to make this game run properly.

												Amazing trucking game that combines RPG and car combat together. Open world, lots of quests, loot stuff, buy new trucks.. Long story with optional sidequests, different ways to do the quests and I believe there are two endings you can get too.Just want to say that remember to save often and save on multiple slots so you can load your old saves. There was one quest that is bugged and if I didn't have old saves I would have been stuck in the game because I couldn't complete the misssion without loading the game. Also when you die there is no respawn, you must load your old save.I recommend this game for everyone. This game should have been more popular!!			",52,2,48,1,9,0,1

												I really liked (and like) this game.Pros:+ Atmosphere+ Trucks+ Modifications (visible, performance, combat capabilities)+ Open World+ Damage (not just visible, it is also has influence on truck speed)+ Phisics (you can feel the terrain, and the difference between e.g. 100 and 110 km/h, also can destruct trees)+ Transportation (you can transport goods between ""cities"" without any quest, so you can earn money with it)Cons:- Not just install and play (it has some problems, to lauch the game (see below))- Could be repetitious after some hours (already completed the game (not on Steam))Problems:It gave me some hours while I could start it at my existing config, but now it runs perfectly (at 1024x768 (can't change resolution)).I also found solution for loading the saved games, so now I'm really happy.There is an old discussion where I posted my comment: http://steamcommunity.com/app/285500/discussions/0/35220315963835670/ ",209,69,13,17,30,2,15

												I found this game to be pretty awesome... once you get into it. you start off in a little truck with one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ machine gun and it is probably not untill you have put hours into the game that you will be able to upgrade to get a second weapon on your vehicle. But that's just the start by the end of it you can be driving a wepons platform with 5 guns and missile launchers on it. The lore behind the game is also pretty interesteing with the different gasmasks factions and people wear. Yep loved it clocked it 8/10			",115,52,1,27,31,1,15

												Imagine Vigilante 8: Second Offense crossed with S. T. A. L. K. E. R.Set in a postapocalyptic world, you, a young farmer with a truck, have to trade, fend off bandits and discover what happened to your father.You can (and have to) outfit your vehicle, ranging from simple buggies to heavy duty trucks to armored personnel carriers, with all manner of weaponry including machine guns, shotguns, missile launchers, energy weapons, mine layers, tank cannons and mortars. There are also gadgets that improve your car such as extended fuel tanks, weapon cooling systems and turbo boosters among other things.Towns serve as trading posts, repair stations and quest hubs. Most quests revolve around delivering goods to other towns, escort missions (which are few and far between) and kill as many bandits as possible in a set time limit (usually 3 minutes).Graphics are ok, keep in mind that this is an older game.Music is fitting to the postapocalyptic setting, consisting mostly of rock tunes, my favorite theme being the one which plays in Hel. Although i wish there were more tracks.Guns sound good, i really like the meaty sound of the cannons.All in all it's a nice game, i got around 16 hours of gameplay on my 1st run (there is a certain amount of back tracking). Be sure to check out the forum for a step by step guide to prevent the game from crashing and how to run it in 1920x1080 resolution. ",386,119,13,63,28,3,65

												Game is playable.  The concept is solid, but the execution is very bad.  Do not buy it for more than $1.99.The game has two major bugs, one won't let you start the game and the other locks you out of using several keys (like ESC to reach the menu) after you start the game up again.  Both can be worked around:Bug 1:

Bug 2:  Start the game up, and make a permanent save (not a quick save) at the first Town/City you reach (Sowth).  Then continue playing normally, quicksave where you please.    When you start the game again, instead of loading where you last left, load up that first save first, Enter the town, then exit.  The bug should be gone and you should be able to load your last save and continue playing normally.  Keep in mind this works with any city that has an enter/exit cinematic.Should keep you busy for a few hours, if anything.  Story won't blow your mind either, does have two endings.

												I saw so many review about people having problem to run the game properly. So, I feel like I need to write this review. First of all, I want to mention this: Played the game on windows 10. Didn't have any problem running it. I just needed to change resolution from config file because the game doesn't have options for new screens. Just read this guide for how to do that:

The only problem I had was the game crashing in loading screen after alt-tab. Other than that, game runned smoothly.You probably want to know how is story or is this game fun(obviously). Surprisingly, the story and lore is pretty good but story presentation is poor. There is two storyline, choosing sides may lead different events and there is multiple ending.Gameplay is fun. If you played mechwarrior before you can see the resemble because you can customize your truck like a mech. You can buy new truck, body, guns and you can set weapon groups, etc.Soundtrack is very good. Every map has different on the road and battle music. I liked every one of them.Some conversation I had with people was very funny. Sometimes the game can turn to a post-apocalyptic parody.Voice acting is horrible. It's like voice actors telling a bedtime story to a little kid even if they trying to say they want to kill you.A.I. is like it's not exist. Especially for pedestrians.If you are an explorer like me I got a bad news for you. Beware invisible walls!There is some bugs and glitches like in every video games. They are not game killer one.In short, it's a great game for an old game. If they released a second game, I would buy it.			",214,43,10,22,11,4,29

												Fallout: Trucker! Ok so, You're a truck, with a big♥♥♥♥♥gun mounted on the cab. You blow stuff up, sell the bits to buy bigger guns, better parts, and badder trucks while going on kill this or go there quests with some flavor variation.The gameplay while seemingly simple at first is very solid and feels good. There is a heavy focus on vehical customization, and you can be a bandit hunter or a merchant type player (haul'n cargo, buying low and selling high) and still advance. The world is (so far) visually simplistic, sporting graphics that would look at home on a late life PS2 game, however the world itself is filled with various factions and different events that change wildly based on the choices you make, like who you ally and who you decide to blow up. The dialogue is a bit cheesy and the voice actors are just bad enough to get by without being ear grating, But the music is surprisingly good and fits the situations nicely when it plays on time (mostly in battle or in cutscenes).I am having fun with this game, definately got my monie's worth already and I plan to put a few more hours into it at least.Final Word: Upgrading your ghetto♥♥♥♥♥farm truck held together with duct tape into a Bad♥♥♥♥♥DOOMBUS of Badassery is the big draw here, though you'll find yourself wishing the game had an ""autorun""/cruse control button before you get some of the faster vehicals.OH! Don't forget to save! I lost a bit of progress when i minimized the game and it froze up. No auto save function aparently.			",298,41,2,53,24,0,22

												A decent game with some flaws.This is one-of-a-kind game, you drive a truck, fight other trucks, collect and trade gear, go on missions, talk with people in cities, buy new gear and trucks in said cities, visit several lands, all the while trying to discover who killed your father.It sports one of the best soundtracks ever, which adds to the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.Combat is against other trucks, generally you'll have three adversaries which spawn and try to chase you. Pathfinding is ridiculous. Merchants carry goods from city to city, but mostly try to climb up trees or manouver in circles. Baddies are a little bit more intelligent, they'll follow you but they never reach full speed, so it's very easy to just outrun them. There are also some scripted ambushes and boss battles.The plot is nothing new, but it gives a thread to follow, and opens new areas to explore.Trading goods generates good money - and you'll need it to buy more powerful trucks - but the best way to strike it rich is through combat and gathering of the remains of your enemies.The game lacks polish, the translation is approximative and it has its lot of annoying bugs, but it can be quite rewarding when you buy a new truck, new gun or discover a new area to explore. Even the plot becomes interesting after a while.Give it a try, it's worth your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite of this game is not fresh one, the gaming is can be very enjoyable. This is a car game witch have action and RPG elements and you play it in Post Apocalypse environment. If i should mention some games what maybe inspired a style , this is a Twisted Metal and Fallout.The game is have a story (which enough interesting), main story quests and the side quests. Game also have good tuning system and well balanced and worked economic  ( resources in each town have different price etc.) Although game is not new, graphics is enough not bad.So my verdict+interesting story+well balanced economy+good tuning system+nice environment-music after little time is can be boring-bugs-cant run at win 7 and 8 (you should patching manually)So if you like a post apocalyptic world, interested int action/rpg car game witch have enough good story and gameplay and don't afraid from that is game not fresh one, you should buy this. So when you see on this game good discount, don't thinking, just buy it. Overall: 7/10			",2101,795,71,247,237,24,306

This one stands out also because game markets have very little anything near the old classic  INTERSTATE '76 . It does start slow in the very beginning, but its long content and long game, so, if you don't allways feel like everything has to be ADHD-level fast, and have some time you want relaxed with wild story, -buy it, you will love it .

												Its a good idea to snipe it for $0.95 when it gets on sale. Anyways the game is great for low spec and a good subsitute of those who want a mad max sort of feel. The voice acting isn't great considering it was originated from Russia but I can't blame them since English wasn't their first language so that's ok. The gameplay is amazing and the quests are a bit ok but hey you still get paid. You get a variety of weapons and trucks to drive in game my favorite being the Ural with the Knight cab and the cruiser which you can carry more weapons. I recommended if you are an rpg and a apocalyptic genre fan like me. I would also recommend HTA: Rise of Clans if you decided to pick up this one. It's the same but has more paintjob variety and you can drive the cars such as the scout and fighter(yeah the ones bandits use to ambush you in).			",62,3,4,6,4,2,3

												Overall it's actually a pretty good game. I was honestly surprised. It has some problems but it's also got a lot that makes it very interesting as a game. An easy way to describe the game is a mix of the X series, Fallout series and trucks. It's a post-apocalyptic Privateer game where you control any sort of truck complete with weapons of all sorts.Pros:-Well designed gameplay. Good controls that do give you some of the heft of driving a truck.-Plenty of weapons, that are even more realistic with varying penetration and degradibility.-Large open world to explore.-RPG elements, mostly in the form of quests.-Trading system that where you can use coins gathered from quests, bartering or loot to get new weapons and supplies.-Accurate damage modeling. I love when games do this because it makes it feel like you actually took damage. Your cab and your hold both take independent damage, and things such as damage tires and even bullet holes in where you were shot show up. However, damaged tires don't seem to affect the performance of the truck which I thought was weird.Cons:-Bad voice acting, if not downright wooden. You can tell that it's been translated literally from another language.-Poor AI, at least on easier difficulties. I know that AI isn't supposed to be so grueling on easier settings, but I can honestly run into one with a consistent spray of machine gun fire and destroy it in a few seconds.-Graphics are a little bland. Although most post-apocalyptic games are like this due to the lack of lush life so I don't have a major problem with it.Overall, it's a fun game and I've barely gone down the rabbit hole in two hours. I see a lot of content in this one, and with all the decently-priced cards to sell you'd be hard pressed not to get it while it's on sale.8/10			",127,18,4,11,23,1,15

Who are these people? Where am I? What is this all about? Seek and you shall find, even learn more than the storyline is telling. Old worn out roads, telephone lines, monuments, secret places, biomes, the world of HTA just doesn't seem to have an end, and the story will put you in the right post-apocayptic mood for many hours.Pros:-Many hours of gameplay.-Well designed open world (for an old game that is)-Role play fun.-Many quests, items, characters to reveal.-Unique gameplay experience, very rare for this kind of game.-A chilling storyline.Cons:-No autosave, if you don't save manually every now and then you will be left stranded. The manual saving works very well though.-Few annoying bugs, they can be bypassed though.-Lack of storyline detail in some quests, ie, could use more cutscenes and speech.-Can get exhausting in travel at times.-No multiplayer. If only this game had full-blown MP support!Conclusion:HTA is my second indie open world favorite for a very good reason. I've just replayed it for 7th-8th time after many years of not playing this game, and I can assure you the experience is memorable to say the least. My first indie open world favorite is A.I.M 1 and 2, which were developed and published by the same authors, and inhibit similar open world and post-apocalypse setting and storyline like HTA, albeit with a lot more detail and story telling. I strongly recommend both games and their sequels HTA: Clan Wars and A.I.M 2. If you treasure unique gaming experience look no further. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. It gives off a similar vibe to Fallout, plus th addition of trucks wiht guns! This game may be from 2005 but my god is it a good game, wish I had it back then! It does crash quite a bit, but in all fairness what PC game doesn't crash? Only downside is the translation is a little lack-luster, but then again it is a mainly Russian game.			",69,9,6,7,12,0,7

												Got this during a sale but still feel ripped off - particularly by Steam - since, like so many others who bought this game on Steam, it has repeatedly crashed. All the fixes listed here that I have tried over a week-long period, have failed to get the game to run  very far past the second area. This has to be, by far, the worst experience I've had on Steam because the game is so promising and yet it won't run - a fact that has kept me trying just about anything short of learning Russian, to get it to work.This is the third game that I've purchased on Steam that has repeatedly crashed. I know that Steam's legal department require them to take absolutely no responsibility for the games they sell, but I still like to imagine that someone in their management dpeartment still cares about their company enough to actually do something about selling a shoddy product. I once tried a game that crashed and later it was updated and fixed, but I notice from the posts on Hard Truck Apocalypse that these issues have persisted for quite some time.With such issues I have to ask - Steam, why did you put this on sale for any other reason than taking money on a shoddy product that doesn't run for most of your user base? As for those of you who feel a need to say it runs fine on your machine - so what really? Does that help anyone else with these problems? All it did was encourage me to roll the dice and fail miserably.			",111,50,4,49,7,1,29

												Hard Truck Apocalypse (HTA) is a game that harkens back to Elite / Wing Commander: Privateer type game. You're a lone trucker, prowling the highways, moving freight, and killing enemies. You can be as good as as bad as you wish, but if you enrage a faction none of their towns will let you enter and their units will shoot you on sight, leading to further bloodshed. As you upgrade your truck wtih better weapons and better models, you will become an unstoppable force of the highways... As you search the world for the killer of your father, are you prepared for the truth? And perhaps, find what caused the apocalypse? And if given a chance, what will you do about it? As the game was released almost a decade ago, the graphics are a bit dated, and out of the box (or fresh install) it has several bugs but all of that can be easily worked around with a few easy edits of config.cfg file. The game is not very stable. There are two notable bugs: 1) sometimes when game's loaded the key commands won't work. You may need to load a game multiple times to make the keys work, and sometimes going into town (not gas station) may resolve it. 2) the game often crashes when transiting between regions (about once very 4-6 transits). You should save or quicksave just before you exit the region. Despite the simple graphics, the game is much deeper than one would suspect. There are trade goods from each town and prices drop as you brought more in, and prices rise as you buy more. Enemies often drop loot which you can sell for profit. Trucks can be customized with various models of ""cabs"" and ""beds"", of various qualities. Some cabs and beds have additional weapons hardpoints and enhancement hardpoints so you can customize your truck. With dozens of weapons, from little 5.45mm MGs all the way to 20mm quad cannons to plasma cannons, lasers, mortars, and so on, you can customize the vehicle into your personal killing machine. Bad parts about the game? No ""autopilot"" or even ""cruise control"". You have to hold down ""w"" to move forward, and you can't lock the view to ""front"" for driving, as the game relies on mouse-look for aiming your weapons, which is independent from your driving. This makes some driving quite tedious, esp. at the beginning when you have a relatively slow vehicle. Also, the game is in essence, a FPS where you ""circle-strafe"" the opponent. Depending on the vehicle, there will be a point where most guns can point toward, and that is where you want the enemy to be. Also, the game's translated from Russian, so there are PLENTY of translation errors here and there, typos, even a few ""missing references"". The plot is also quite... cliche. Still, if you like Mad Max style games this will be right up your alley. Even if it's not, if you like the ""lone wolf roam the world"" genre you should give this game a try, esp. if you get it cheap.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												Sure, this fun little oddity of a game could have used a lot of polish back in the days. But it comes with a truckload of post-apocalyptic charm and has such a stylish dieselpunk vibe to it that you can probably overlook most of its flaws if you have a soft spot for the genre.That said, minor flaws are plenty. Some of them add to the charm, some of them feel like they wasted potential. For a vehicular combat game with plenty of off-road opportunities, the physics are rather simplistic. So are the graphics. The writing feels like they tried to be epic in scope and witty in style, yet it comes across as more of a cheesy translation accident. You get a rather large open world, yet much of the gameplay and storytelling is a lot more linear than you may expect. Towards the middle of the game, all the long-range errand-running starts getting tedious, artificially stretching the game without adding content. They do have a nice choice of vehicles and gear to keep you interested though, even if picking the right truck for the job is usually a no-brainer.Still, Hard Truck Apocalypse basically delivers on its promise. It's fun. It's stylish. It's a very high-concept idea with a very cheesy title, and in many ways, that already tells you a lot about what to expect here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really enjoyed the game play.  However, a physics bug caused my truck to fly into a building and explode.  No auto-save.  Lost about two hours of play time.  Kinda ruined the game for me.  If I had screwed up, I could stomach the loss of time.  But I ran over a fence post and was hurled, through the air, at 3x my normal speed, into a building, which was no where near my truck when I hit the fence post.Still, the game is worth a try.  It fills a very interesting niche that only a few other games fit.  (Auto Assault and Interstate '76 come to mind.)  Would love to see a more modernized version of this game either with auto-save, or without bugs that can cause you to lose a significant amount of play time.Though I am giving a positive review, I won't be playing the game anymore.  It's certainly worth trying out.			",603,130,23,108,63,6,109

												Here's another wish for the sideways thumb or neutral option.  It's a hesitant recommendation as it definitely shows its age, and the framework they have didn't seem like there's much room left for improvement later in the game.  You're a truck, you shoot bandits.  ...That's it.  Grind long enough and you can get better armor, faster speed, and more guns to probably shoot more bandits in various vehicles.I'm mainly convinced the game doesn't change at all because of the core mechanics of combat, in that it's not really dynamic.  You drive in circles to make the AI lazily track you while whittling away at their health bar and they whittle away at yours.  Between that, you play Euro Truck Simulator and drive from point A to point B in a lifeless environment.It's a thumbs-up mainly due to the charm that is there - it just sort of plops you in and says go have fun.  The voice acting is so bad it's okay, and it doesn't do much of any hand holding in terms of ""here's what to buy / upgrade"".  I could see the appeal in it, but ultimately not for me.  It's cute, but I wouldn't pay 8 bucks for it.			",597,158,28,51,30,6,74

												I have played this game for a week now, and after working through a bug with the video code I have become slightly addicted to the game. Once you get the basics of trading between the communities in the game you will have plenty of money for upgrades and new trucks, if you choose not to you will struggle as I found. I would recommend this game for people who enjoy large open maps, driving, adventure and small puzzles.			",84,8,2,8,7,1,13

												I have played this game couple of years ago. I have spent so much time playing this game, and still i am surprised by the variety of the story line. This game is one of the best games I ever played along with Need For Speed Underground 2 and Euro Track Simulator 2. For me this game is better than Skyrim (I like guns more than swords). For me most of RPG games looks the same - swords, bows and magic, whereas this game is different. i rather fight with multiple guns (which can be used at once) and upgreating my truck with speed and horse power than with couple of possible guns walking around the world (Fallout3). It however requires some patience when making it work on windows seven, but it takes no more than 10 minutes to fix it with the guides on steam community site. I have to warn you that once you play that game you may never look at other rpg in the same way. Hard Truck Apocalypse among games is like 'Breaking Bad' among the tv series - you will never forget it.			",71,9,19,8,57,2,32

												My initial review of this game was ill-informed and I had not yet fully understood the game, so I want you to see my ""before"" review as compared to the ""now"" review.---Before---""As a pure 'go there, then here, there there again' game, this game can be fun, but gets boring fast. Coupled with mediocre graphics (which is usually something I don't mind) and a laughably bad story, the game just doesn't amount to much more than a filler for the Steam store.""---Now---After diving deep into the heart of this game, I have seen that what was once a try-hard story and dull mechanics, are actually fairly moving and exciting. Granted the game takes it's sweet time to get the ball rolling, but once it does, you are presented with a huge amount of options as well as a huge amount of places to go.Want to be a mercenary with the most kick♥♥♥♥♥weapons imaginable? Have at it. Want to be a fairly low-key trader? Be my guest. Want to become a hero to all? Go ahead. Want to be the most hated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in all the land? It's all yours.The selection of vehicles really got my attention too. You have a vehicle for any job. You have light trucks (that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing at the beginning), medium trucks, heavy trucks, battle platforms, transports, and even little buggers that speed around everywhere.The guns tend to be a little lackluster until you get to mount 2 of them on one vehicle, where you can rain death on anything and anyone that opposes you.The enviorment was really amazing. Even though the game is fairly ""pre-uber graphics,"" it runs really well and looks really nice, plus there's some 400km^2 of land to look through for secrets. Yes, 400 squad kilometers, or about the whole of Sicily.The story behind the whole game is also very (very) believeable: humans were careless and polluted everything so much that everything else died and now we have to wear ♥♥♥♥ing masks all the time just so we don't die of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ air, and now the only way to make a living is through trade of necessities of stealing of those necessities.This game is really worth your time, but remember to SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN. I lost about 2 hours of working that way.			",133,26,3,8,36,0,35

												Of the two Hard Truck games, this is the better of the two in several ways. But in others, it isn't. I wish I could do a ""meh"" because for $1.50, it's not bad.Pros:Trucks with gunsSomewhat open world, but you still have a story lineControls are easy to use. Driving and aiming are done with the keyboard and mouse just like all your other FPS games so nothing goofy there.Customizeable truck bodies and lots of different weapons.Trucks looks cool and the animation is solidCons:Voice acting. Ick. Sounds translated and not always that well. Also, voice inflection doesn't match the situation. For example: Father dies and the guy says ""No"" like he's ordering a sandwich.Color schemes for customizing your truck is limited to a solid color.People animations are weirdResolutions are limited to only a few non-wide screen options			",381,90,12,72,63,2,56

												This game is worth buying , a good open world kinda rpg just instead of walking and horses here you are in a truck doing everything you do in a open world rpg.Tons of main quests , side quests to do. You even get choices that will decide your friends and foes in the game.Tons of stuff to upgrade your truck with as you go to different parts of the game buying other trucks is possible too. The game has a extensive Trade system where you can make a lot of profit if done right.The only issue i had was that the game wont start up , the only fix for it is to delete all the video files in the video folder and the game runs great after that.Its a addictive game you can drive over anywhere you want and take your own path , hard to stop playing. Very happy with the experience.ps: like others have mentioned in one line it's ""Falllout 3 on wheels"" :D			",980,374,71,167,150,10,179

												This game is fun, it's like a mix of Freelancer (that space sim by Microsoft) and the Fallout games; it has vehicular combat and trading like Freelancer does, but is set in a post-nuke-apoc like the Fallout games. The only things I would warn people about are the cheesy dialog and voice acting and the fact that trying to get it to work on Windows 7 is (at the moment, hopefully they fix it) a hairpuller; I've heard people have managed it but it required a lot of work and not everyone has the same success with the same fixes. But I have a Windows XP machine and it works like a breeze; the graphics look a bit like Gothic 2, so not the best but hey there aren't too many vehicle combat post-nuke-apoc trading games out there.

												I have mixed emotions about this one. Just going to quickly say if you are about the graphics I suggest looking over this one. If however you do like gameplay and a RPG type thing with a truck, then heck this game is for you.The game definitely starts out a bit slow, and the traveling can seem endless. Over time though it gets better the more money you get and can customize your vehicle. There are factions within the game you can fight or make friends with, which of course comes with trade. Weapons are interesting as some provide a different scheme than others. Some weapons can fire no matter what direction you are pointing while some have limited range. One thing I found sort of interesting is if you press C (I think it was), a camera drops from the vehicle your driving and stays like a land mine. This camera angle helps to shoot an opponent while remaining stable. Although you cant always see your truck, this sort of gives a bit of freedoms driving around (given you can see your truck which way your shooting). It's a interesting game and would recommend buying it on sale if your looking for something different. I also wasn't a big fan of the voice acting.If you're looking for a ground breaking game I suggest you keep going.6.9/10			",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Nice game to play with.Not much story,  but role play atmosphere is steady.Not a lot of music and best option is to disable music at all, its too repetitive.Origins of this game is from the Russians, so be ready for a bit of bugs and mistakes in dialogues.But nothing so bad that which could not fix with help of Community Guides. Main goals in game is get a lot of gold, upgrade your truck and defeat  enemies...As a result, stronger enemies drop better items that can sell higher, so you can upgrade your truck and buy better weapons.Yea, this simple mechanism makes a game little exciting.  It can been called - grinding  :)Grinding to try out fairly wide of weapons and gadgets.Thou, many games of that time introduced similar mechanism.Still, there is quite large maps, and sometimes quests can drive you away to the other edge of the map.And you are driving with your slow truck on the road and think to find out some shortcut in wilderness.But I recommend this game not only to postapocalypse genre fans, but anyone who like simple rpg experience together with racing and shooting.And wait for sale, I got mine only for 0,79€			",186,63,12,54,22,1,32

												I started out recommending this game, then I got to the end and decided to take it away.  The story isn't all that great from the beginning, and the translation is AWFUL, but I was willing to look past that and just enjoy the game for a Car Wars game that it was at heart.  By the time I reached the middle of the story, they toss in a completely disposable story arc into the game to add an additional few hours of gameplay.  Then, when you finally get to the end, instead of tying up loose ends and a decent conclusion, they force you into a one-on-one fight that ends with a scrolling text ending.  WORST ENDING EVER...  OF ALL TIME!= = = = = =Hard Truck/Ex Machina can be described as Mad Max/Car Wars meets Privateer in a devastated Europe.  Hop into a armed and armoured truck and track down the mystery of your past and the world around you.The game starts out where you play merchant and deliver commodities (potatoes, wood, scrap, etc) between towns/villages to earn enough money to repair, fuel, and upgrade your vehicle, while you go from quest point to quest point.  Then things ramp up and you change over to hauling in weapons and commodities salvaged from anyone who attacks you so you can upgrade your weapons and vehicle to survive while moving from quest point to quest point.Play mercenary and destroy outlaws that roam the maps targeting you and other drivers.  Then pick up their loot and sell it to the nearest shop.  Other drivers will help if they stumble onto your fight, and if you are close enough to a fortified town, their turrets will also join in.Play adventurer and take jobs from strangers (mostly found at the bars) to make special deliveries, escort people, etc.What else...  Oh yeah, avenge your adoptive father's death and find out who you really are.You know, when you have the time.			",137,88,0,52,37,1,38

												Game seems alright its Fallout with cars really. When I first started the game up it was just a back screen I was going to request a refund but I had a look and a guide before doing so. There was one to fix the black screen and luckily I did not need to refund even though the game was only 55p as I got it on the summer sale. I am enjoying the game so far there are a few bugs like when you roam and want to pick up a enemy item by pressing T on the keyboard it sometimes does not work along with opening the map etc. It works after you enter a town luckily the horn key H still works. Would I recommend it yes as it is still a fun game overall and if you can catch it for 55p in the sales then go for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   To be honest, this is the first legitimate review I've ever written, but I need to just say this; All the negative comments are mostly right, but they make it sound way worse than it actually is. Sure, the graphics are 2004-ish, but it's not really that bad. Graphic quality doesn't bother me, I'm more of a gameplay person. That's why I prefer having a fast game and poor graphics than a beautiful game with 5 FPS. I don't have the best computer myself, but it's not the worst. You can pretty much play this on your toaster if you wanted. The game isn't an American game, so some of the translations are a bit... funky. And the graphics are what can be improved on the most.If you like vehicle based combat, get this game.If you like RPGs, get this game.If you like open world games, get this game.If you like all three, There is no reason NOT to get this game.I'd rate it 8.5/10, just because of the graphics.

This is a game you can drink while playing and still be fine.   I lost my physical copy and found it on sale for a couple of dollars and couldn't pass it up.			",287,66,12,39,21,0,15

												for me, i have mixed feelings, mainly good. the control scheme is wonky as hell and the graphics are maybe up to par with late ps2 or XBOX BUT. i like the idea of a post apocalyptic truck game and it's feeling to me a bit like fallout with vehicles. i like it personally and if you want something different this game is for you but don't go into it expecting the UBER best. it's great for what it is however and i would definately recommend it, i wish it had a multiplayer funtion too as the game feels a bit large and desolate. but yes. a good game all in all :D			",108,10,4,23,6,0,1

												I beat this game in about 10 hours. My playtime doesn't show because I had to get a patched .exe (and a program to extract some compressed game assets) to get this to run without crashing. This game is a Russian open world car combat RPG from 2005. It is EXACTLY what you are expecting from this game, including the difficuly in getting it to run properly. It feels like it was made by robots. Dialog is stilted and very awkward, there are typos everywhere, missions are simple, the story is absolutely insane. The gameplay is fine, but the main draw of this game is Russian weirdness. A large chunk of it is driving from point A to B. If you're even looking at this page, you know what you're getting into, and it's a wonderful janktastic world waiting for you.			",428,185,22,50,58,4,62

												This is an actually fascinating game. I think it's open world enough that you can go around doing stuff without pressure from the main storyline - a tale of hopes dashed, possible betrayal (I just finished the very first part, okay?), and... stuff - and quite a lot to do and kill.If you come here for something truly on the level of, say, Fallout 3, then you could be disappointed. If you come to this game just wanting to drive around, mod cars, and blow up cars then this could be for you.Just disregard the dialogue and the zombie-pallor characters.			",124,17,0,39,14,0,33

												Alrighty then lets set up a Review to this.So HTA / Exmachina is a Russian made game where you drive trucks , shoot stuff , customize your truck to your needs and explore the waste. The game overall is pretty nice . As if played this game when i was a kid. I loved it back then but it had massive problems which brings me too two negative points or lets say . This game got two main problem which one of them can be fixed and the other too.. i suppose.The first problem is the engine and this game engine is..... a stone is more stable and runs better . Not saying the game cant reach 60Fps and run smooth. No the game crashes sometimes and has no autosave option. The overall options like Resolution / Graphics / Sound . They sometimes wont save and you have to edit them manual.And now for the second problem.There is a Windows 7 patch which sound awesome right? Well not quite its russian only. I managed to install the patch without problems but i spend houers in google translating the text in the insturctions . Quite the time... did the job... i hope.Ohhh and there is suprisingly a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of mods for the game.Im not the type of dude for verdicts but yeh.""Its a good way to waste time ""Thats all waht im gonna say about HTA / Ex Machina Thanks for reading.

												Heh, this may be the best $2 I've ever spent. It's a trading game (as in buy low in town A, drive to town B to sell high) with vehicular combat. Don't expect anything to make sense, but you'll enjoy the ride none the less :o)Note: I had to change some config.cfg options for it to work right on my win 7 box (resolution / intro movie).

												A very good combat & trade game. Tight graphics and wonderfull mechanics, like the best titles of genre. Maps are big but landscapes are a bit melancholics by its simplicity. Has autolevel of difficultly, and fight is a constant challenge, but collide against trees or rocks brings an excesive damage. The unpardonable is it did not updated after Win XP have expired: at begin a black screen can appear without any final patch or solution to fix it; when playing, goes from bad to worse, with bugs and glitches before crashing definitely. A true pitty, but at its actual state is little more than abandoware, and the game do not deserve it. The main page says true: only works well in XP. If designers dont do nothing about, the right thing is get it out of the market until make a real OS update, and not lie to community with poor patches or code editings to create false expectatives and sell more obsolete software.

If you aren't willing to put time into applying a few fixes though, it probably isn't worth it for you.Otherwise, the game itself is great. It's simple and fun. There isn't much else to it.Pretty much what others have said, it's like Fallout with trucks.Right when I reached a point where it seemed monotonous and repetetive, things got interesting.The promise of advancement, upgrades, and new deadlier weapons keeps the fun going.But again, you'll need to apply multiple fixes.Most importantly, look up the ""unpacker method,"" and you should be fine.

												Its a shame because this is a pretty good game but it does keep crashing, you get so far and then you cannot load any of your saved games. Ive tried 2 or 3 of the advices that steam forum support give and they work once and then it keeps persisiting to crash. Then steam suggested contacting the developers, so you go to the website which is in russian but does bring up an option to translate. But its still difficult to navigate, so you try searching for the game and then it reverts backs to russian and your stranded. (unless russian) if anyone has any other ideas of how to stop it or the developers update and fix all the bugs then i will highly recommend this game because what i have played is really good. Until then i suggest waiting until they sort it out.QUICK UPDATE!Ok so i deleted the game and then reinstalled and it loaded my saved games perfectly! fingers crossed i dont have to keep doing this everytime i want to play. I still stand by maybe waiting just incase deleting and reinstalling isnt a perminent solution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can generally wiggle out (O button is supposed to fix stuck issues but has only worked once).  Save a lot - there is no auto-save and if you die, you go back to last save - that can be a beating.  There is a story-line but I mostly drive around picking up ""missions"" and killing bandits and seeling their loot for truck upgrades.Physics are meh, acting is bad but game is pretty fun - worth $2 for sure.

Yes, the graphics are dated, the voice acting is ludicrous, and the text is clearly written by people who speak English poorly, if at all.HOWEVER: It's a fun game. Whether you're just doing the main quest, the side quests, or exploring, it's a blast to play. The truck upgrade system lets you feel you're driving your own unique vehicle.

For a finished game, its boll0cks, when you load the game from a save (if it loads at all), I can't open the map or many other things. There are other bugs I've had, though in My crap mood I can't recall them.The fact of the matter is, when all is said and done, yes its cheap, but that isnt an excuse to be a bug ridden mess. Fix the bugs and this would be a decent little time killer of a game, but its been out for ages and its left up to players to do it.

												Hard Truck Apocalypse (released 2005/2006) is a game I was looking forward to playing. I expected a mash of Interstate 76 but with an open world feeling like Privateer. It delivered on these core concepts but that was all. I found myself yawning my way through the game with long arduous trips as a delivery boy instead of being wrapped in the story and combat. The dialogue needed attention although this is Russian designed game and some aspects may have been lost in translation.Pros:- Cumomisable armed trucks (trucks, cabs, trays, weapons, enhancements).- Moddable.- Reasonable music and sounds.Cons:- Very linear. Optional quests are repetative and offer no benefits other than financial.- Too much money after the half way mark. Didn't even bother to loot.- Game crashed after crossing 4-5 regions. Save often!- Long pauses between dialogue (and even then the dialogue was a chore to listen to).Other:- I have read on forums this game is difficult to run on newer operating systems although this was not the case for me (Windows 7).

												I really want to like this game, but its so hard to get working and keep working on any machine with a newer OS than win98. I managed to get it to run on Win10 with some effort, but it still crashes constantly. It seems like a fun premise and the potential is there, but it just doesn't seem worth all the effort you have to put in just to get it to run. Once you do get it running, you'll find the voice acting to be terrible and the plot to be pretty much non-exsistant. Vehicular combat is interesting, but again, it hardly seems worth the effort.Overall, I'd just pass this one up...			",227,34,7,20,5,3,10

												easiest way to explain this game it's like fallout exploration only you begin life as a truck and you can get new vehicles in new towns by selling the junk you get by killing enemy vehicles. some customization, skins and lots of junk and guns to loot and buy it's a good game 10/10 ",84,10,7,13,9,0,18

												ok so before i say anything else this game is locked in 4:3 resolution, second if you do want to play in a 16x9 you have to edit a config file to force the resolution but when doing so its going to strech some textures improperly and smush other textures improperly.  now as this is a deal breaker for me that is about all i can say except that the talking feels wrong you can realy feel the rusian translation happening in how they talk, aslo to mention carecter mouths dont move when they talk.  after experienceing these 3 disapointments i decided this game is worth 0 stars no thumbs up and a big dont wasnt your money stamp of disaproval.

												Boring, vast landscapes barely populated with any assets or life. No autosave which is not easy to get used to when you travel for 10 minutes between points of interest only get killed and have to make the arduous journey all over again. Combat is boring and just involves holding the fire button down while tracking other vehicles. Progress is very slow.The dialogue is all strangely written, probably without any proofreading and I assume not by English natives.To be fair it's 11 years old now but then again so is Brothers in Arms which I played recently and that was great fun.It has gotten me in the mood to play Mad Max though...

												Horrible title, poor voice acting, and numerous bugs hide a surprisingly underrated game.i have been playing this on windows XP a long time ago but when i switched to windows 7, the game would be missing things ingame, or not work at all.so, what did i do to get it to work on win7?1. unpack the packed gamedatathis appears to fix a lot of loading problems, and made me discover this game actually had weather and a skybox. this process is normally a part of loading but breaks down on many win7 machines.http://steamcommunity.com/app/286810/discussions/0/540736319869969103/?l=dutch2. modify the main configuration filethis handy little tool allows you to correctly adjust the game resolution for any screen, and can turn off video's that might chrash the game if you have x64.http://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/hard-truck-apocalypse-config-editor.201894/3. create a debug profilethere's a chance the ingame menus crash the next time you run HTA and load your last save.Every time HTA starts fresh and before you load a game, start a new game on an empty profile, skip the cutscene and quit to the main menu after the game asks you if you need hints, this appearing of the hints dialog seems to fix this issue until you shut the game down.4. compatibility mode I tend to use the ""vista"" mode, but my experience is that it only somehow helps the first time you need to pass a loading screen,  after that the game seems to work without it until you uninstall it.another thing, SAVE OFTEN and don't be afraid to use console commands when the game breaks you! (example: game physics suddenly decide to hold you hostage on top of a lootcrate just above the ground, bandits keep spawning and eating away your hp, game logic doesn't understand you're stuck; you rage and abandon hours of progress)this game can be very very punishing even with cheats.

												I honestly wanted to like this game.  But, between the lack of ANY post-apoctalyptic feeling to the game, poor mechanics, and stupid enemies, I cannot reccomend this game.  Even as a driving sim, it sucks.  First off, the game uses kilometers.  And you are stuck at about 90 kph the whole first ""level"".  The characters are laughably poor.  I felt zero empathy during the burned village scene.  There is no reason to follow the story.  None.  The whole game feels ""clunky""  i guess is the most positive way to describe it.  And don't get me started on how weak your enemies are.  Or how OP your starting truck is.  The most annoying thing for me, personally though, is how obvious it is that the game creator's english ruins all parts of the game.  I don't know if this guy is from Romania or where ever...  But please let someone else speak for you in COHERENT english please!  Cant belive I wasted money on this.  not worth the $0.99!			",29,4,0,9,3,0,4

												I want to like this game. The idea is nice and the music is very soothing, almost mellow.But there is no autosave unless you cross a border, and sometimes the game crashes right AT the border.It takes ages to get from A to B and at first it's almost impossible to earn enough money to upgrade your truck.Using a godmode cheat helps, but even so it takes a long time.The voice acting often is rather uninspired, the physics are quite weird, and, although this is rather positive, you can actually cross the mountains in your truck. (Saving a lot of time.)It's a nice game, and if it weren't for the crashes and an easier way to make money, it might be worth the time. But as it is, I'd rather not play it anymore, so I can't really recommend it.			",187,117,12,30,14,3,12

												I really wanted to like this game. And I did. It played fine for a while and it was a LOT of fun in the short time I played it. However, after I loaded my first save, some keys became unresponsive. Most importantly for me, was the Esc Key; if I can't get into the menu of a game I just bought, there is something VERY wrong. And I don't care if there was 88% off this game when I bought it... a bucket with a hole in it that cost 10c is still a bucket with a hole. And it's the principle of the thing.There are threads on the forums here with all kinds of ""Magical"" solutions... none worked for me. Here is a solution I would like to see... I buy a game on Steam... and it works! Is that too hard to ask these days? This is an old game, true, but should that be an excuse for basic core elements not functioning... like keys?I'm really torn about this, because again, I enjoyed what I played of it, and it has quite a bit of depth to it. I can't play on though with unresponsive keys. This game, and many, many more like it should be checked before they are uploaded by developers to Steam.I ask the developers, if you read this, can you please fix these issues. This game will see much better sales, if people like me, are not forced to come in here and write a negative review about a game they actually liked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												More than 40h in the game, I give up.I can't but say that any other game you can be playing instead, will be a better use of your time than this one.Despite being fortunate enough to avoid the bugs that made the game simply unplayable to most people on the forums on Win7, after the first hours more and more of other game-breaking bugs started to jump at me time after time, to the point I could not bear it anymore.The idea of driving a heavily armored truck in a Mad Max-like world and just roaming and shooting around while getting upgrades, seems simple and fun enough at first so as to give it a try. But, oh, buddy, there be dragons there. You may be able to cope the bad voice acting. I did (well I just wanted to drive and shoot at things).You may be able to cope with the bland game mechanics. I did (oh, but I wanted to drive and shoot at things :( ).You may be able to cope with the nonsensical story. I did. Took a lot of patience, but I did.You may be able to cope with the bugs. I mostly tried to.But please, PLEASE, do not cope with wasting your time in this game while there's so many others you could enjoy. I did, and I'm sorry for it.All in all, this game is simply pointless.			",370,94,11,32,15,4,43

The vehicles bounce around like they are driving on super balls, you know, those toy rubber balls that bounce really high. The game isn't localized at all well and the text is hard to comprehend most times. The graphics are low rent. The quests have you running all over hell and creation trying to find all kinds of crap and people and what have you.

And at different times of the loading process. A few times the app crashed while just the game loading. Meh. I was enjoying it too :-(. All that said. The story isn't horrid, but most certainly ""D"" grade.  The controls aren't bad though.  In all honestly I DO want to play more. but 1.2 hours in and the game becomes completely unplayable for no apparent reason is all I need to know to give up and play one of the 600 other games I have on Steam I haven't gotten to yet :-).

												I really wanted to like this game. I love post apocalypse games.This game has potential, but it is beta version at best. I know that it say's it finished, but it rally isn't. It has so many game crashes that it is just unplayable. Even in it's unfinished state I liked it, so it is with sadness that I can't play it from all the errors. With a finished game, I should not have to go online to figure out how to boot up, start a new, or go to a new map without the game crashing.As for why I say it is unfinished, it has no background noise other than music and weapon fire.The driving AI is bad, it is like the got it mostly there, ie can get from point A to B but can't follow the roads, then quit.They use invisible walls for some terrain and the proper slope for others to make hills impassable.Other small things, it was just like hay it sort of works, lets quit.I do like the idea and hope someone in the future will make a working version of this game.I know I would buy it.Not from Targem Games or the publisher Buka Entertainment of course, since this is what they consider a finished product.

Yes, I have paid attention to forums, gone into the config files and switched screen resolutions, deleted video files - done most everything I could.  But I can not even start the game without fiddling with the Screen resolution each and every time, and I have only been able to go into a new area without the game crashing during the loading screen.  Perhaps I'm the only one who has issues with this game (but by the forums, I'm guessing I'm not) and I absolutely love Insane 2 (also by Targem), but I would not recommend this until we get a patch for newer machines.

												This game has that ""special something"" but it is seriously bugged. Im to old to spend my hard earned money on games that crashes all the time!!! I recommed that Targem Games makes some thorough beta-testing before releasing a product in the future. For now: Patch this $hit up cuz Im NOT paying for your game just to end up feeling like a beta tester.DON'T BUY THIS GAME (yet).			",26,3,0,6,1,0,5

												This game is terrible...The graphics are bad, and the translation is half-hearted. I'd be willing to overlook the aesthetic shortcomings if the in-game mechanics and gameplay warranted a better review, but the entire product feels like a botched, 2nd rate release from 1997.

												Хорошая игра. Прекрасный сюжет. Прекрасная атмосфера.Но на данный момент не рекомендую покупать ее, так как, она полностью не играбельна.После 1.5 ч. игры просто не могу запустить игру. Если удается запустить игру, то не могу запустить сохранение...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here's a game where the voice acting was all done in one take. With badly translated scripts. Probably a lot of whiskey.			",394,100,25,58,115,8,122

												It sounds like an interesting idea.But the game itself is dated and ugly and the voice acting and dialogue is pretty bad.Most importantly, it constantly crashes on me when trying to navigate to the next region.  Which makes it barely worthy of a demo.  So I wouldn't know about any depth to the game.			",100,66,0,46,11,0,37

												As much as I kind of like this game, I can't recommend it. The basic gameplay is a good time: Drive, kill bad guys, take stuff, upgrade truck, repeat. A lot of the incompetence is actually fun, like the crazy bouncy physics, poor translations, and the main character's dead-voiced, random exclamations: ""The roof is on fire."" What's not fun is having a 70+% chance to crash every time you see a load screen. That makes the game basically unplayable. If they fix it for Windows 7, I might give it another go.

												First off, you will need to turn off videos in settings if you run on NT 6.xSecond, on Windows 10 you need Threshold 2 (10586) to run the game.As for review itself, the HUD is morbid. For a person with disabilities like me, the minimap should be on BOTTOM LEFT and occupy about 400x400 pixels.			",272,41,6,51,14,6,65

												It's hard to say if the game is good or bad if it simply doesn't run. I was waiting for it to load, looking at black screen for a few minutes, and then realised that it will not work.  But Steam says that I'm in-game - ok, at least I will get cards... Nope, they aren't there... Try to turn it off - ha! Steam still ""see"" me as in-game. I had to restart computer to fix it. So  all in all - don't waste your money and your nerves on that one, save for something that would be worth it.P.S. Now actually game drops cards, so if you are collecting them - game might be worth buying it on sale. As for everything else - I stand by my opinion. Second attempt  to run it didn't change anything...			",2619,1106,70,256,327,24,363
