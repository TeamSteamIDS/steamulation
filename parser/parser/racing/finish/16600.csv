The graphics are great, the sounds as well, and the puzzles are, well... remember that word I told you to at the beginning of this mini review ? Yes ? Great ! My job is done.Excellent game though !

												I started playing trials with Trials HD on the Xbox arcade where I would build my own tracks and try and beat top scores over and over.This edition of the game is great and feels good when doing a perfect run. The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.			",283,48,9,32,29,1,26

I bought it on steam a few months ago. For a 2008 game (youll see me say 2008 game alot) It's actually stunning, physics and graphics ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. It's sad the game is dead and no one is in chat anymore, I still play this game and I highly encourage you to get this game instead of the new ones like trials fusion♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is the real og this is the real trials.

												Trials 2 is a great game, i had great times playing it.  Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance. It´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc!Also is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available. You can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be.  It´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.			",179,50,10,15,19,2,12

												For a $2.49 purchase price it wasn't too bad. After clearing the stages I didn't have any desire to go back and replay, perhaps if I had the option of running vs AI bikes or online people at the same time (onscreen) it'd have been a different scenario but as it stands, it was a purchase I could have gone without.The gameplay is tight but there are moments of ""UGH I WILL DESTROY YOU."" There are some physics exaggeration but that is to be expected for a title like this to work and be successful. While they are exaggerated they do make sense. The audio is quite repetitive and the music, oh the music... I'd have preferred being able to load my own music instead of listening to the garbage. I turned it off.In the end I can't recommend this game because there are newer editions out that *should* feature the onscreen multiplayer I mentioned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.			",367,82,24,48,37,4,62

												This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played.  If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements.  In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.
