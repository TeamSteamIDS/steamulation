												I could recommend Jockey Rush if:*You have an interest in the subject matter (and the strategy involved).*You want to play just a jockey game (no breeding or training decisions to make).*You can get Jockey Rush on sale and think the value is right for a pretty simple game with no bells and whistles ( -- wait, there is that out of place slide whistle sound effect when your jockey reputation goes up or down).Jockey Rush is a pretty basic horse racing game where you just get to be the jockey. There is some action with the racing, and a lot of strategy. You try and pick the best horses to ride out of the entries you're offered in a race. Are they bred for the distance? Well bred with a graded winner in their pedigree? Compare their stats and consider their running style. Then try for the best finish possible when you ride in the race, and the strategy continues based on your running style, how the pace unfolds, getting the right position, and timing your moves right.Like in the same dev's Starters Orders 6, the racing is pretty good for a game. It comes down to the horse, and they all have their own running styles, pace, and stamina; the right position, and the right timing can help; and you can't really do stupid things you could do in old riding games like hard blocking and checking your way to an easy win.Also like SO6, there are tracks similar to real life tracks around the world like Meydan in Dubai.

			Jockey Rush is a pretty basic jockey mode game from the makers of Starters Orders 6. Here is a brief look at the game, picking the right horse to ride, and some racing.		

It doesn't have a lot in presentation. There are no frills, not even background music. Even in auto racing games, I like a lot of visual and audio feedback, and a decent soundtrack. So, points off for that. But it is what it is. Personally I used it to pass time between races and some handicapping on opening day at Del Mar, and was looking forward to riding some winners in Jockey Rush. There is also a Battle Mode where jockeys freely kick and punch eachother. Stewards inquiry! Suspensions and anger management for everyone!			",203,14,28,15,15,2,1

												The game starts off deceptively simple. You get a list of ride offers. Each offer comes with the trainers expected finishing position. Beat that and increase the rep stats and get better rides and so on.There are no flash extras such as long dialogs or a story so initially the game can feel just a little, well basic. It's worth keeping with it though as after a while it begins to open up and the depth begins to show. There are lots of realistic courses. The horses are simulated well with the form develops in a realistic fashion as the game progresses. Eventually you get engrossed and begin to look forward to the key races and get to know the horses in the game.The studying of the horses form before the race is a big part of the game and another area that improves as the game progresses. The races themselves are very well simulated. You need to ride each horse to it's strengths and try to get the race position correct. The visuals are ok with everything turned up (but nothing to write home about). I really like the jumps racing despite the long length of some of the races! While some of the racecourse are basic others are great (Cheltenham for one). The key to both flat and jumps racing is to try not to mess the horse about with lot's of pace changes. In short the races are probably the best simulation there is but they do lack certain gaming elements that some may be used to. Winning isn't easy but there is a genuine thrill to getting a horse home in front above the trainers expectations. In summary if you enjoy horse racing then I recommend Jockey Rush.

												Very simple game, and with me being a fan of Starters Orders 6 (I would recommend buying that instead) It's too simple, it's  just an arcade game, not enough detail for me. But may suit others.I would have liked more focus on the Jockeys career, it seems as though there really isnt one, its just level up, tediously and get offered to ride better races, could have had a lot more in the game but there you go.

												This has the potential to be as good as the G1 Jockey series...But, regardless of where I run the horse in relation to its preferred style, metre is never full and always end up going backwards. Will reconsider buying when more people, more tips and advice out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excited to see a game with jumps racing took me a long time to get the hang of jumping. Fell at the first about 20 times in a row!!I am now getting the hang of it a bit more, you have to jump quite early to prevent falling. I even won a race today!			",8,0,1,1,9,0,7
