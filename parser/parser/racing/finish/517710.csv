												Absolute blast! Best Wipeout successor! However a shame that I don't have a 360 or ds4 controller. I tried it on m/kb and my Steam Controller but this game MUST be played on a classic controller with 2 analog sticks, it's crucial to get the most control out of it for pitching and strafing which you will need to do. A lot.			",59,12,2,3,7,0,3

												I deleted my original review and put a few more hours into the game to see if some of my original crits could me remedied through practice. After a few more hours into it I can safely say my problems aren't me not knowing the tracks well enough or the car I chose, it's the game. Pros- Art direction is good with a really polished look. - The better track designs are well designed*- The music works. Some cuts are good others are totally forgettable but it could be worse so this is a ""pro."" - Good sense of speedCons- AI is absolutely terrible. At first I thought i didn't know the tracks well enough to compete and hit the walls too many times to catch up. But after spending some time in the Pure Time Trails and getting in the top ten in the leaderboards in a couple or tracks and the top 50 in others, I saw first hand that racing against the computer is broken. If you lose first place during a race or last man standing, forget about it. You simply can't catch up. I tried different loadouts in the car, different tactics during the race. No go. I absolutely could not catch any car ahead of me after I lost first, second or third place.- No racing game is good when it favors hitting the walls instead of tactical driving to get the best times, which is exactly what RedOut does. That's exactly how I broke into the top ten on the leaderboards. I was trying to race with precision initially, breaking and taking turns trying not to hit the walls. The game actually punishes you for this as you have to break the car down so much to the extent that you simply can't compete. The cars simply drift too much for it to matter and you almost have to come to a dead stop at times. The times posted trying to achieve perfect laps will never be very high and in some cases you simply can't get the gold medal for events. Once I started hitting walls I noticed that I maintained more speed going into turns as opposed to breaking into a clean turn and boosting afterward. Totally backwards and not how a racing game should play unless it's something like Twisted Metal.- The cars drift a bit too much making them a chore to control. Even with mag/grip upgrades my car would drift too much even when turn early AND strafing. It's not as bad as Formula Fusion where the controls are so bad you'll be lucky to finish a race let alone win it. But for this to be a WipeOut/F-Zero clone, how do you screw up the controls even early in the game?RedOut is trying very hard to be a F-Zero with WipeOut art direction. But anyone that's played WipeOut and/or F-Zero and gotten good at them knows the controls are very tight. RedOut's controls simply aren't that good. To ask the gamer to navigate rollercoaster tracks at high speed with cars that drift too much even after upgraded, AI that cheats to the extent that you can't catch them  and hitting the walls is a way to win is just sad. What's worse is that with some practice I was able to compensate for the floatiness of the cars. But the suspect AI and sloppy wall hitting tactics ultimately killed it for me. I regret this purchase as I was looking for something on Steam that could compare to WipeOut or F-Zero. RedOut isn't it. Don't let the pretty graphics fool you. You'd be better off emulating  WipeOut Pulse or F-Zero GX. Both are better games. RedOut is a bad imitation in a very pretty wig.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
Anti-Gravity Racing is BackAnti-Gravity (AG) racing has been a niche racing subtype that was once made popular by the legendary F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD series. Dominated by kart racers and racing sims, AG racing is making a comeback in full force with Redout. Known for its combat racing and high-octane, high-speed aesthetic, Redout’s take on the nostalgic genre will appease many fans waiting for such a release, while welcoming all those that may be new to the racing subgenre. Also, VR support is optional, and a photosensitivity warning is presented upon launch, so take care.GameplayCareerCareer is the traditional career-style progression system where you win to earn experience, level up and purchase upgrades. You first start by choosing one of six sponsoring teams and a ship. Beginning with a Class I ship, a slew of various races and race types are presented for you to undertake. These races each have certain goals, and how well you perform dictates the resulting experience and money awarded. Contracts are interspersed throughout the campaign which task you to fulfill certain objectives for a particular reward. Overall, there will end up being 75+ events to race with 23 (excluding the starting) ships to purchase. If you happen to only be interested in single-player modes, there is definitely a sufficient amount of content to keep you busy.  Quick RaceThere are 10 different race types you can setup, including Time Attack, Speed, Survival, Instagib, Race, Pure Race, Arena Race, Last Man Standing, Score, and Boss. The major differences between these modes lie within the restrictions regarding health, damage, powerups, speed, enemy performance, and time. Speed, for instance, provides additional turbos encouraging you to stay above a target speed in order to get bonus time reductions whereas Last Man Standing eliminates the pilot in the last position every lap. There is a mode to highlight every style and preference of play, ranging from solo handling performance to group defense performance.OnlineAuto-join, manually search, or host a race with 12 pilot multiplayer support. All Quick Race options/game types are available for selection. Local coop/split-screen doesn't seem to be supported yet.Ship CompositionEach ship has 6 different stats to take into consideration when selecting a starting racer, including: acceleration, max speed, grip, structure, energy pool and recharge speed. Other than the physical and mechanical properties altering handling behavior, two important characteristics of each ship that must be maintained in-race are the health and energy meters. Grinding the sidewalls and track floors will reduce health while utilizing turbo and powerups will reduce energy. Keeping a harmonic balance between the two meters will ensure the highest turbo speeds and survival.Careful utilization and mastery of the powerups will help you take over any competitor. Some of the unique items at your disposal include additional turbo, shields, self-repair drones, energy disablers/drainers, slipstream enhancers, and more. Also, these powerups are not in-race pickups. They are equip-able modifications that either passively affect the ship, or must be actively utilized in-race. These powerups can also be upgraded even further, and only two powerups may be equipped at any time (one active, one passive).Ship HandlingRedout's handling is best described as floaty (in a good way). This doesn't mean that it's unresponsive, insensitive, or overcompensated. Just that there is a realistic sense of feedback and control; realistic as in something expected of a futuristic anti-gravity racing ship. As mentioned by the developers above, the handling was based upon physics derived from quad-copter controllers and real magnetic forces.Advanced handling features include strafing (which is completely different from drifting by the way), pitching, and turbo boosts. Strafing is extremely important to keep your over-zealous self from bumping into every wall while pitching helps prevent blackouts, redouts and nose/tail grinding when a track decides to go loopy. An important feature that the developers wanted to incorporate is the fact that there should always be a way to confront a corner without braking. It may take precise steering, strafing, and boosting, but must definitely be possible. I found the complexity of a successful no-brake turn in Redout much greater than a kart racer’s turn (drift/handbrake), but much simpler than a rally racer’s hairpin turn (Scandinavian flick technique).

 PresentationArt DesignRedout employs a very futuristic aesthetic & diverse world - 20 tracks are available for racing, taken place around 4 locations (Cairo, Alaska, Abruzzo, and Volcano) that must be unlocked in Career mode before free use. The 4 locations each have a unique biome: desert, arctic, jungle, and lava respectively, and Redout’s variation of these biomes ensure that each track feels very different. Another important aspect regarding Redout’s art design has to deal with its sense of speed. The game utilizes heavy vibrations, passing landscapes, high-speed collisions, and extraneous sounds to improve immersion and create a high octane, adrenaline rushing experience.Screen Resolution & Full-Screen SettingsCurrently, there is no method to change your screen resolution or windowed/full-screen settings in-game. In fact, you can't even tell what resolution/full-screen setting the game has set you up at. This ended up giving other players issues with external software/GPU technology (FreeSync, VSR, etc.). Fortunately, for now, an unofficial guide has been created to inform users how to manually edit an .ini file to alter these settings (Guide Here) with successful results.VerdictThere is an unfortunate lack of tributes to the racing legends that were once popular near the turn of the century, especially on Steam. Becoming more and more niche by the year, Redout breathes life into the dying combat racing genre. Furthermore, it lives up to the pent up expectations that many AG fans, including myself, have longed to express. This makes it extremely easy for me to recommend Redout to all of the AG and realistic combat racing junkies out there. Setting aside a Millennial's nostalgia for a moment, I want to address Redout's mainstream appeal. I'm sure that there will be a large portion of gamers that are not too familiar with AG racing, and wonder if Redout will be worth it. The only thing I can say to this group, is that Redout is one of the most unique racing experiences on the market, especially one that is released recently – I can’t stress that enough. If you're only familiar with this decade's kart racing games, or racing sims/rally racers, just understand that AG racing has a different feeling and difficulty to it. When I first played F-Zero GX and Star Wars Episode I: Racer back in the day, I couldn't believe how sensitive the vehicles were and how difficult it was to survive and succeed. I'm sure many newcomers will feel the same way at first, but as eye-opening as F-Zero GX was to me, I believe Redout could be the same to you (in a good way). I welcome any and all newcomers to the AG racing genre with Redout. Its relatively simplistic controls and combat system, along with adaptive AI, makes this AG racer very friendly to beginners.

												Got to the last event in the career mode.  Couldn't blink for 30 minutes for fear of crashing and burning and my eyeballs were aching.  Totally worth it.Some other cool moments came up too somewhere in the middle of the game where you finally get the driving mechanics and you're drifting consecutively through two or three zig-zags without missing a beat.  What a great feeling of control when you're just nailing turn after turn.  Ship designs are to die for, and the whole aesthetic is simply amazing.  F-zero style graphics with Wipeout design choices and gameplay to do both proud.			",157,20,1,16,6,0,19

												F-Zero GX is my favorite game of all time. I have kept a GameCube set up and ready to go since GX's release just so I can play it. In fact, it's the only GameCube game I have ever owned. My GameCube exists only to play F-Zero GX. And every night before bed, after donning my GameCube in its protective cover, I kneel over my pillow and pray that Nintendo will make a faithful PC port so that I can cease taking the Xanax I need to ease the ever-present anxiety that my GameCube will one day stop working, thereby rendering F-Zero GX a mere relic of history.With that out of the way, let me say that Redout is not F-Zero GX. It is far more like Wipeout XL than it is like F-Zero. Unfortunately, this means that it is not the game it could be. Every way in which this game deviates from being more like F-Zero GX in favor of being more like Wipeout XL is a way in which it fails to live up to its potential. That is because Wipeout XL is exclusively worse than F-Zero GX. This game begs for tighter steering and more precise strafing. It pleads for modular vehicles and tuning options that introduce sacrifice rather than serve merely as strictly beneficial upgrades. It demands best-time ghost saves that can be raced against.Those things being said, this is truly the best futuristic racer I have played since F-Zero GX. It is fast feeling. Really, really fast feeling. Ironically, this is rare in the world of racing games. Although in terms of mechanics this game is more Wipeout XL than F-Zero, in terms of quality it is far more like the later.---------------------EDIT: I almost forgot: The most annoying feature of this game is that F-Zero's control scheme isn't an option. Would it really be so hard to offer a control scheme with R and L strafing and the button for boost on the controller's face? Would it? Unfortunately, I have not mastered the the ""4-fingered shoulder grip,"" so boosing means having to sacrifice my ability to left strafe for the duration of the boost. Super frustrating (not really that bad, but still... it's the principle). Just let the user define their own inputs!			",121,54,1,8,5,1,11

												Where to start?...First and foremost, this game NEEDS to have a Demo. This genre will have the most critical and skeptical players of nearly any game genre out there. I'm sure, me saying I think it's amazing is overshadowed by the experience we all had with F-Zero, Wipeout, and many of the other gems this genre holds, as well as many experiences with clones and wanna-be games... But, here we go…Also, if you've made it this far, there will be no Too Long; Didn't Read skip phrase here. This review will be long, but I will give as many examples and comparisons as I can. With that all out of the way, let us get started.This game, as I see it, relates to several other gems of the genre, as well as some outside of the genre, and is overall a great Anti-Gravity racing game. I would compare it to F-Zero, as well as Wipeout, as many others have, I'm sure. However, I would definitely compare it to the N64 Star Wars Pod Racing to some extent, as well as Hydro Thunder (Both the N64 original, as well as the XBLA sequel). This game would also be comparable to any of the great Racing Sims out there (Gran Turismo, Forza, Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally, Etc… Whichever you like best.)Redout takes most of the greatest aspects of all of these games and puts it alongside a great sensory pleasure of fantastic, stylized graphics; an amazing soundtrack (Which we ALSO need to be able to buy) and tight, responsive controls.From F-Zero, it simply brings the Speed, as well as the difficulty. In terms of speed, the first class of craft you can pilot reach roughly between 800-1100 KM/H, Which is comparable to F-Zero, and is naturally the slowest class in the game. This wouldn't be so staggering if the fastest vehicle in class 1 only filled up the 'Speed' stat only 1/5th-1/4th of the way (Depending on upgrades). The majority of Class 3 and up Crafts have near max 'Speed', as well as near max 'Acceleration', which, though I'm far from acquiring, I would assume is beyond insane.From Wipeout, there are the power-ups, however done a little differently. Instead of picking them up mid race, you equip them to your craft, which is an interesting decision, but it fits very well within the game.From the Star Wars Pod Racing, it takes a somewhat similar overall feel. Craft collisions are a huge part here. You either race to wreck, or race to avoid, and either is very manageable, so long as your reactions are quick enough. There is also a simple Boost mechanic, limited by a constantly recharging energy pool, which also fuels your power-ups.From Hydro Thunder, there is not just the visually stylized Craft. Unique, varied choices not only in looks, but they all legitimately feel different. Some have similar stats, but they all handle very differently from each other.From the Racing Sims, it brings a level of realism. This game is Challenging. It handles like a twin-stick-shooter, but it's a racing game. You HAVE to use both analog sticks simultaneously (And I would definitely say a controller is a must) as well as have at least a basic understanding of how to take corners or you will fall behind very fast. This game's idea of failure isn't when you die, you must restart, but more so watching your opponents lap you when you get too cocky on one of the harder tracks. This game handles very well for an Anti-Gravity Racer, and though it is unique, it is what I suspect will set the new standard for what this genre should aim for.The only downside I have for this game would be the requirements for it. I meet minimum requirements, and still, the game runs very poorly. I will say, however, this game easily is the game I will build my next PC around. It is playable on the lowest settings for me, but it is quite obvious this game, brought to its full potential, is quite the benchmark and indeed, beautiful.I would definitely argue this game will be what defines the Anti-Gravity Racing Genre for the next generation. The tracks are technical, the FOV and sense of speed is beyond anything else on the market, the controls are tight and responsive, and there is plenty of content to keep you playing, as well as Online Multiplayer. In terms of a Racing game: 10/10. Overall, stacking up against any other game: 9/10. Easily a staple in my library, personally. One that I will come back to quite consistently. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[UPDATE] The rubber banding I experienced at first is only a problem in the beginning, it seems. After some ship upgrades I have been able to beat opponents by more than ten seconds. Still enjoying the handling and feel of everything, although I wish the career had a little more character - some rival portraits would have gone a long way, for instance. Still, the game so far is pretty much what I hoped for, and I hear there's even a proper time trial mode on the way. I will add my final thoughts when I've progressed far into the campaign and played some multiplayer.[First impressions] - game is extremely pretty; an explosion of colors and sexy futuristic shapes. The controls are tight and demanding. Really does feel like a cross between Wipeout and F-Zero. I'm a little worried about the AI though, it seems to have a lot of rubber banding.

Posted: February 6
												Possibly the greatest futuristic racing game of all time; Redout is an absolutely essential purchase for anyone who’s grown up playing classics like F-Zero, Wipeout and Extreme-G.  This game does so many things right on so many levels it’s astounding, from the stunning visuals & sound design to the intelligent and ruthless AI.Make no mistake about it, Redout is FAST. Certainly its most divisive element, then, is just how floaty the vehicle handling is relative to both the windy-ness of the tracks and their relative visual similarity in each location.  This is a blessing in disguise, however, because Redout mandates track memorization and precise driving lines in a way I’ve rarely seen in similar racers.  The learning curve is steep, but taking the time to race the tracks over and over to learn their intricacies is absolutely addictive.The track design itself is brilliant, constantly temping players with wide straightaways to boost faster and faster through before throwing them into harrowing hairpins, loops and corkscrews.  Later courses completely throw reality out the window, serving up some of the wildest tracks seen this side of F-Zero GX, with massive jumps and only the smallest of margins for error. Redout’s single player campaign was for me worth the price of admission alone- over 100 career mode events cover a wide variety of game modes like time trials, tournament races, survival events and more.  It’s sure to take quite a few hours to finish off and does a great job of introducing the player to the game’s mechanics in the slower speed classes before letting them loose with the faster class 3 & 4 ships and the most difficult circuits. Redout’s multiplayer component currently consists of online racing, with local split-screen sadly not included at time of writing.  The online multiplayer works flawlessly and I’ve had a blast in online races, though it’s worth noting that during most hours of the day the online community seems quite dry (certainly not a fault of the game itself).  The game also includes online time-trial leaderboards, which is sure to create fun competition amongst the community.I only have a single true criticism of Redout which involves the game’s collision physics.  Colliding with fellow racers at high speeds has a frequent tendency to send your vehicle into a violent spin, occasionally resulting in your craft facing completely backwards.  It’s a mildly frustrating occurrence, especially online when only the smallest of missteps can be the difference between first place and missing the podium.  It certainly adds impetus and a certain amount of realism in needing to avoid crashes with other racers, but at the same time is a bit unforgiving and could welcome tweaking in a future update.I honestly cannot recommend Redout enough.  I’ve waited literally over a decade for a racer of this magnitude to be released and am absolutely blown away by what 34BigThings has been able to accomplish, from a small independent studio no less.  Hope to see you all on the racetrack!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A High Speed Futuristic Arcade Racing Game

+ The sense of speed is absolutely insane! You go ridiculously fast in this game 500mph+ and there's boost!+ The gameplay is incredibly fun if you are a fan of fast-paced arcade racers. You fly a hovercraft with some sort of jet engine on the back while competiting in a large variety of races.+ Very unique and interesting controls. You actually have to use both analog sticks to successfully get around sharp corners. The right analog stick controls the pitch and shift of the craft. You sometimes have to lift the nose of the ship up so it doesn't grind against the floor of the track during sections that sharply rise up like a loopty loop. + Visually the game looks absolutely gorgeous. Every stage is uniquely themed with a lot of eye candy, fantastic lighting, and very detailed environments.+ Fantastic stage design with a large degree of verticality, it's almost like being on a roller coaster at times as the track turns from side to side, sometimes even going upside down or even flying as you go off massive jumps+ Great progression system. You warn cash after each race which you can use to buy upgrades, new ships, power-ups, etc. There are also special contracts that will reward you for doing specific challenges.+ Very challenging+ Great soundtrack~ This isn't neccessarily a downside, but the game can be frustratingly difficult to new players or people who are not good at racing games. There is no difficulty settings, so you have to improve as a player if you want to get far.			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

												At first I wasn't completely sold on Redout the strandard modes were nice and the races fun at times but it lacked a spark.That all changed when I played the Boss race mode though. If anybody remember's and liked that old Hot Wheels movie (Hot Wheels World Race Highway 35) your in for a big surprise. The moment I played the boss mode it was like a wave of nostalgia washed over me it was like I was racing in the very races of that movie. The jumps, the teleports, the amazing tracks, the items all came together to create this nostalgic masterpiece. This game is without a doubt the BEST arcade racer of 2016!I've only just gotten to the level two cars and the difference between level 1 and 2 is CRAZY.  The amount of speed the level 2 cars have over level 1 is shocking to say the least. I'm having a hard time imagining what the level 3 car is going to handle like never mind the level 4 cars! PROS:-The adrenaline rush is intense with pulse pounding speed.-Amazing Graphics/Art style-Stunning race tracks with loops, jumps, teleports, etc. -Great stylized hover cars they each handle differently-Lots of game modes-Beautiful soundtrack (Still waiting for that ost guys)CONS:-Needs more tracks: What they have is gorgeous but there's only 4 areas; lava, desert, artic, jungle. We could use some underwater or space themed ones.-More cars: Again there's nothing wrong with what they have but more variety is always nice.-Multiplayer is a bit of a ghost town a times but since i never bother with multiplayer your milage may vary.Suggestions:-Could use a radio where we can play our own music while driving. Helps set the mood a bitI give the game a 9/10! Amazing detail and love were thrown into the making of this game.For those who don't know what hotwheels movie i was talking about:

												This review is from a VR perspective.It's not perfect. That said, I love this game. The feeling of speed is REAL! The first time you jump into the game, you'll feel your face melting off, and each time you get a new class of ship, that ""first time"" facemelting feeling comes back. As you can imagine, motion sickness CAN be a problem, but there are ways to get around this. Use the ""back bumper"" camera view to reduce your FOV. Also, adjust your Vive lense distance (the black plastic rings on the size) to be as far out as possible. Suggestions to developers:* PLEASE do not mount the loading screen to the display. The loading screen should be floating in 3D space like the rest of your menus.. just seeing this screen makes me crazy dizzy.* Disable the track ""flyover"" camera in VR. That section before you start a race and it's flying through the track, upsidedown, backwards, sideways? Yeah that's REALLY hard to deal with in VR and gives me a huge headache. If you don't want to disable it, please at least remove any lateral movement from it.tl;dr game is good get it, VR or no			",147,19,6,7,13,1,1

												This is the UE4 revolution at its most apparent. In nearly every way this is a perfect game--easy to play, difficult to master, beautiful levels, a constant rush of excitement and real speed. To address some other reviews, the AI is a challenging system, not an unfair one (I am a Wipeout fan prior to this and get gold medals approximately 2/3rds of the time). The instant adrenaline games, the true pick-up-and-play games have been neglected for too long. Finally we are able to start putting the fun back into gaming and it starts with Redout.Edit: After 10 hours I've nearly finished the career mode, that's pretty fantastic for a WipEout clone. I need more games like this.			",131,10,5,4,7,0,11

												At Last. A game that feels like Wipeout 2097. They have nailed the control scheme, the atmosphere, the tracks and even have done quite well with the soundtrack to. The speed is addictive. If you spent hours playing Wipeout 2097 back in the day, then this is what you have been waiting for.In VR it works well but as always, start with the lowest graphical settings to go for that killer frame rate then up it slowly to what your system can handle without any jarring. Personally I tried it on the lowest settings on my 3 year old PC and only the Oculus DK2 but it ran really well with no issues (make sure to up the max frame rate option in game). As a bonus i felt no sickness or nausea but so far VR has not added too much to the experience but it was nice to get some depth perception that may have helped at little in control. But of course you are not really looking around just facing forward to handle the speed. I found it better to play with the camera view showing just the nose of the craft to give you a point of reference in the VR space and look out for the loops though as I instinctively kept looking up so dont strain your neck with the adrenaline :) It also appears that your progress in VR mode will be separate from your progress in non-VR mode.

												This is definetly the F-Zero replacement I was loking for! Fun and chalanging to people who are experienced with games like this.Disclaimer:Just to clarify yes it is laking in F-Zero like lore and such and some may think it is because the deves didnt p[ut efort or annything but after talking to the about the game they did mention that the game was in development to long and neded to be shiped once complete so extra stuff i am sure was droped. But reguarding the feel of the raching it is very F-Zero and shows allot of potential in a sequal or sister game that could have a more F-zero like lore.			",130,18,3,15,11,1,25

Redout is the Wipeout successor you've (probably) been waiting for. I say 'probably', because there might be one or two things you find off-putting. Let's start with the elephant in the room: the difficulty. A hurdle that many people feel too high to overcome when starting out. Now the first four races have rubber-banding, but after those four events there's none of that anymore. The devs have already stated that they're adjusting this ""welcome gift"" to make it easier for players to get into the game.   Unlike Wipeout, Redout doesn't feature pick ups based on rng. Instead you choose one active and one passive power up before the race. This gives the game a bit of a strategic approach to races, since you can choose the tools that suit you best(you're able to boost by default.) And choosing the right powerups for your purpose has a significant impact on the outcome. It's able to change the result from ""wtf I don't even make bronze"" into ""You can't lock up the darkness"" mode. So I cannot recommend enough to experiment with powerups everytime you feel stuck.  Another thing that might seem off-putting is the weight of the ship. Particularly in relation to bumping into other ships. Getting a bump from a boosting ship from behind, might give you a spin that turns you 180° in the other direction. This is especially annoying since it breaks the flow of the game. A grave injustice to AG racing across all boards. However, the devs stated that they're working on that, so this point might very well be moot in the near future. One thing I personally find a bit weird is the upgrade system. There's only one upgrade per stat and per ship(four in total.) Meaning that after one click, you're done with upgrading it. In most cases, you buy all the upgrades the very moment you buy your ship, making the upgrade system a bit arbitrary for a feature. I feel like upgrade tiers (I-V for example) would've done the feature more justice. The way it feels now, is that there's an upgrade system, just so the game can advertise with an upgrade system. As a feature itself, it's fairly underwhelming. Now for the good things though, and here it gets pretty straightforward actually. Speed, handling, visuals, music, AI, content/race type variety, and especially track design(the volcano tracks are some of the most amazing tracks I've seen in a game, AG racing or not), they're all top notch.Racing at high speed through a sandstorm against the well made AI feels as great as you want it to feel. If there's ever been a love child between the feeling behind Star Wars' pod-racing and general AG racing, then this is it.In terms of race type variety Redout comes with the following:   Regular races Tournaments Pure events (no powerups) Time Trial Speed (time trial with a speed threshold. Every second you match or are above the target time is reduced from your lap time.) Score (gain points for position, boosts and perfect laps.) Last Man Standing (last place gets eliminated each round) Arena Race (no respawns, last one alive or first place wins) Instagib (increased damage and no respawn) Survival (race until you explode. Pass checkpoints for score but beware of the mines on the race track.) Boss (multiple tracks tacked together by teleporters. Yes, it's as neat as it sounds!) Redout isn't a Wipeout clone, and does not want to be. The ship handling is fairly different, there's no airbrake but rather floaty strafing/drifting and the speed starts out much higher than in Wipeout. Redout is aiming to make its entry as a top grade AG racer, and as far as I'm concerned, the devs succeeded. With Wipeout off the grid since Sony closed its studio, 34Bigthings are in a position to corner the AG racing market with a new genre staple. And if this is any indication of what they're capable of, then I can only hope that Redout isn't a one time endeavor for them.			",81,19,2,15,7,1,12

												I remember playing F-Zero GX on the gamecube years ago. It was a great, extremely-fast paced racer that had numerous tracks, a great soundtrack, and lots of replayability. Unfortunately, Nintendo seems to have left F-Zero on the shelf in an undisclosed basement and we have not seen much hyperspeed hovercar racers in a long time, let alone on the PC platform.Suddenly, I heard about this game 1 DAY before it launched, claiming to be a ""tribute"" to games like F-Zero. Having played it for several hours, I can say it's a solid tribute, though not without a few cracks.Let me get my criticisms out of the way first:  The difficulty of this game is all over the place. Most of the time, I had no issues getting gold  or platinum  on my first attempts. Sometimes, the events were challenging, but still doable. However, there are a few events that are ridiculously hard, especially the first pure race that you are allowed to do. I don't mind a hard challenge, but you shouldn't kick a newbie's teeth in when...  There is no tutorial to explain some of the mechanics. I know the loading screen tips told me to pitch up to avoid scraping on the ground, which would lower my speed, but I don't know why I should avoid blackouts or redouts or if there is some trick to improve my pure racing performance. I also didn't know I could upgrade my vehicle until I saw someone's gameplay video. Basically, a little hand holding for new players would be much appreciated.  The AI seems a little finicky. Some tracks, it manages to perform well to be really difficult to pass (hence the issue with pure races), but on other tracks, it slows down heavily at certain bends that makes it way too easy to stay in front.However, despite these issues, I'm willing to overlook it as the rest of the game is really well designed.  The game has a really cool sci-fi look, almost like a simulation.  The controls are great and feel similar to F-Zero (with a few tricks of its own).  The SPEED is aaaaaaaaaAAAAAaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaawesome!  Really great track designs, with some having really cool moments.  Excellent dynamic soundtrack.I hope the developers can continue to work on this game, as I would love to see it just tweaked a bit more to become even better. It's not perfect, but it's probably the closest we'll get to an F-Zero game on the PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Description:It is basically the aesthetics and verticality of Wipeout mixed with the strafe from the first F-Zero and the speed from I don't know a game that feels even remotely this fast. If you like any futuristic racing game you should definitely buy this.Three upsides:Feels incredibly fastDoesn't hold your handVery vertical track designThree downsides:More or less requires a controller because you want a second stick to be able to have analogue controls for pitch, yaw, strafe and accelerate. It supports keyboard/mouse controls, just saying that you will be considerably better off with a gamepad.Vertical bends are often poorly telegraphedA few events combine multiple tracks into one via teleport gates. You can not see the next part of the track until you get teleported, which often leads to you grinding the wall of a bend the first time around. It's tough to learn what is coming because those events tend to have extremely long lap times (three minutes and more). ",166,30,3,14,11,2,9

												Put F-Zero, Megarace, Wipeout and five tabs of acid in a blender and you have Redout. The music, the atmosphere, the vehicles and the speed are all very well done and I played for 3 hours straight before I had to stop to lower my pulse. This is what a futuristic racing game should be. This is going to be a hit.			",479,96,36,70,68,1,58

												After seeing TotalBiscuit's review I was quite intrigued. A modern F-Zero/Wipeout..And they nailed it for so far I can tell (roughly a hour in). Graphics are colorful and up to par with modern games.The soundtrack suits the game. You like speed and racing?Try this. It's one hell of a blast..  Playing this on a 5820k @ 4.5 Ghz with a 980ti on a 1440p 144hz monitor. And well..I'm not maxing out at 144hz,so it's quite taxing on full details.			",61,23,6,5,22,1,12

												This is one of the best racing games I played in the last few years, although it has somewhat little content, you always want to improve your record time and keep getting better.+ nice graphics+ good performance+ tuning is simple and makes an actual difference+ good music+ really good track design+ challenging gamemodes and KI+ the sensation for speed is awsome+ frustration kept to a minimum, I never felt demotivated while playing, even when I get messed up by the KI drivers / drive really bado content is not really huge, replayability makes up for ito some more statistics would be nice- I never found any online games (can't really blame the game, though)- the interface is a little messy- inconsistent difficulty (sometimes I give my best and end up last, sometimes I drive sloppy af and get first place)In my opinion it is worth the price, at least when you are into these kind of games (F-Zero, WipeOut, etc.).If not, wait for a sale, pick it up and try it, it does it's thing really well.

												You like racing games like F-Zero, Whipeout etc. ?Get it.You like going fast?Get it.You like active online gaming?Nah.This game is great. The start might be rough since you have to steer and shift the ships at the same time but once you get used to it, you´ll enjoy it.The music might be repetitive if you have to repeat courses several times (You just want the gold medal) but still, the music´s real good. (In case you don´t like it you can still use your own music.)Graphics looks real good, even on Medium settings. I would compare it to the F-Zero GX graphics since they´re kinda similar.Last but not least is the online gameplay which I couldn´t play once since this game has a daily playerbase of ~10 people. Try to ignore it, play the Carrer and enjoy it. It´s not all about online gameplay :)tl;drIt´s hella lot of fun. Grab it if you can.			",87,12,7,8,4,0,4

												""Race faster than ever"". I think the devs have the right to claim that their game is indeed the fastest AG racing game.The graphics are blocky"" (it's a new type of graphics used in many games I just don't know the term) but they're very well made. The tracks are awesome. The music is better than the usual soundtrack such games include. The controls (gamepad) are very good and actually there are three different types of controls you can choose from which is awesome because you can find what fits you more.During the race you won't be able to pickup a weapon but there's an energy bar that you can use to either boost your speed or to use the ""add-on"" you've chosen before the race. There are also the usual boost ""places"".In the career mode you earn money which you use to upgrade your ship, to buy the next class ships, to buy add-ons and upgrade them. By choosing the right add-ons and upgrating them, I think the difficulty curve is just right.I didn't find anything bad in this game really. In the first place I wanted it to include weapons, which I still think would be a nice addition but this is not something bad about the game. Redout is great even without the Wipeout weapons.Race faster than ever!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It feels like hover forza lolsecond; the AI. OOOOOOO THE ♥♥♥♥ WEEEEEE. those AIs are some feisty sum♥♥♥♥♥s, but they make your heart race like now other.. seriously, i did a race five times back to  back and the last time i was in  GT Lunace up against a Hussar and the dude made my ♥♥♥♥in hands shake. BUT I ♥♥♥♥ING BEAT HIM  AFTER 5 TIMES!!!!! AND THE FEELING WAS LIKE WINNING THE DAMN LOTTO!!! and  that was just one of the HARDER class 1 races i thinkthird: NO RACE NAV: now tbh, i was kinda disgruntled with this but  then i l began to appreciate it because i start realizing the nav is all in the track. you just have to put on your racers docus and PAY ATTENTION. dont be afraid to break in turns, just make sure you lean with everytihng you got and use boost to come out.

A great Wipeout-inspired racing title with optional VR modes!I gotta say, ""I love this game so much right now.""  Redout is providing me some of the most beautiful visuals I could ask for from a racing game, and its controls are pretty simplified and user-friendly.  The UI is both easy to read and easy to navigate. (Some players may find the power-ups menu slightly confusing, but it's really not bad.)  The sense of speed with this game is impressive.  The time attack mode is challenging and worth your time, but yes, there's a mode with AI racers.  I've played a little of the multiplayer and it's leaps and bounds better than the AI in single-player, so much so that I never stand a chance at winning.Vive support is still limited but no longer buggy!I bought this game for $26.24 during the Black Friday sale after eyeing it for about a month as a potential VR racing game.  Unfortunately, this was not yet a good racing game for the HTC Vive when I bought it... at least not for me!  I managed to get into the first race in SteamVR mode, but it wasn't rendering the UI at all before or after the race.  At the time, the game wouldn't even work right with Steam's overlay.  That said, it's fixed with the 1.1.0 patch, and VR is finally working well enough to enjoy it.  The game doesn't look quite as finely polished in VR, and it's a heck of a lot harder to play in VR, but it works well after the patch, and I bought the game primarily for the VR experience initially.  I'm a little disappointed with the cockpit model, but there's a no cockpit, no ship camera mode that works very well if you can get past the motion sickness aspect of it.  The game does not support the Vive controllers but for some reason supports Razer Chroma... a funny choice, that was.  Anyway, an Xbox 360 controller works well for this game.Razer Chroma lighting support is cool!Redout is the first game I've seen to incorporate Razer lighting effects.  It's a cool feature, but it doesn't seem to follow the game's music's pace very well.  When the music is fast-paced, the lights are a steady, somewhat slow speed, so it's not quite as awesome as it could be.  The keyboard controls are also not the optimal way to play the game.  You'll want to play this game with dual joysticks.  That said, Redout inspired me (partially) to get my Razer products, and the Chroma keyboard effects are magnificent.  If you're thinking about such a purchase, it's worth every penny.Tading cards and tradable game items!Yeah, almost everything has trading cards nowadays, but Redout has in-game usable items which can be traded on the Steam marketplace.  This is actually a rare thing even though Team Fortress 2 has been doing it for a long time.  If you get Redout, be sure to recoup some of the cost by selling the in-game items, because right now, those items have value.Overall, this game is well worth the $26 I spent on it, and the VR features are a nice bonus, even if I never really want to use them.  You will have to have a powerful rig to truly enjoy its spectacular visuals in VR, but it'll run fairly well on a modest gaming rig without VR.  Tuning the graphical options is fairly easy and can result in nicer performance for low end rigs and VR purposes.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												As a huge Wipeout and F-Zero fan, this game definitely satisfies me. The controls feel great, the tracks and visuals otherwise are lovely, and it provides a decent challenge.For VR nerds: Having been playing with a Vive, it's a little disappointing that there's no cockpit view yet, but the developers have stated that it's a work in progress (no ETA provided though). It still makes for a great experience, though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, this one time, a guy on my Facebook said that his game was finally released. Being sceptic, I assumed it was going to be another eight-bit graphic indie rush job. Yeah- no. It was Redout. A fully fleshed out Zero-G racer. Shut up and take my money.Redout is a three dimensional racing game. You take control of a futuristic pseudo space car which magnetically sticks to an aggressively winding and looping track and try to be the best pilot at roughly 800km/h. Not only do you take corners and bends, but you also need to mind your angle when taking slopes. It’s a very involving and definitely a hands-on game. Very engaging; not for the faint of heart.When you first try the game you’ll quickly become acquainted with the wall and your best friend the respawn prompt. Your ship has a durability bar, and hitting the wall, ground or other racers will quickly drain it. Learning to fly this machine is key and until I had read a guide on Steam on how to corner I was grinding my ship into scrap at every other corner. The key is to understand the strafing mechanic. You can adjust your alignment to the track ever so slightly, but in the corners you can use it  curve round the apex neatly and initiate a little drift for effect or you can correct your exit and make a swift boost onto the straight. Practice makes perfect and flying a race without ever touching the walls might be worthy of its own exhibition in the Louvre. The ships come in four classes, from fast to “my face has come off”. Every ship controls slightly differently and at times you’ll find use for even the most skewed vessel. Each ship looks simple on level one, but become much more alien and ornate on every level. Although they look like tricked out polygons, you’ll be too busy going fast to care. The music is on the mark. Satisfyingly pulse pounding and energising. Some tracks stick with you, however, the selection is limited. The tracks are the true stars here. With five different environments and with about four different tracks on each, you’ll quickly become familiar with many twists and turns. Hairpins and sudden drops are part of the game. Insane airtime and submarine sections are also par for the course. There is as much up and down as there is left and right. Learning the tracks is immensely rewarding because the AI is terrible at big hairpins, so knowing when to pounce is the key to winning races. Breaking up the monotony are a slew of race types. From regular races to time attacks, as well as elimination, speed limit runs and super races that connect all tracks from one environment into one super race. Making your way through career will take a pretty long time. You’ll be rewarded for every medal and you will keep going to better yourself after buying a power-up that just made all the difference. However, afterward I found very little else to do because online appears to be pretty dead. I only found one other player and he wasn’t even on my level. In short, Redout is blindingly fast, unforgiving, long, rewarding and fun to play. However, the learning curve can be a big turn-off of many and linking your available machines to your career process might be hindering online. However, the sheer exhilaration and tight experience make it very worthwhile.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

Product received for free
""To Infinity and Beyond""I hope you're wearing your time travelling pants because this review starts in the past.Come back with me, if you will, to a time when movie-goers were watching a young Angelina Jolie in ""Hackers"", party-goers were dancing the Macarena and school-goers were all busy playing with their Pogs.As Coolio would tell you, the year we're talking about is the Gangsters Paradise that was 1995.""Houston We Have A Problem""Whilst the world was rooting for Ross and Rachel to get together and OJ Simpson to get what he deserved, I had my own problems.I'd said goodbye to Windows 3.1 and embraced the revolution that was Windows 95 but I was still being tempted away from PC gaming by something called a PlayStation.It was shiny and new and I really, really wanted one...The problem was that I'd already spent all my money on Pogs so just like Apollo 13, I had a problem.""I'm Broke but I'm Happy""Thankfully 1995 saw the birth of another shiny new thing called EBay.It was a sign, fate wanted me to sell my earthly possessions and buy the new console.... and who am I to argue with fate.So it was with a Braveheart that I said goodbye to my Pog collection and hello my shiny new PlayStation. Having taken the plunge into the world of the PS1 (although we just called it a PS back then)  I took Alanis Morissettes advice, put ""one hand in my pocket"" and bought a game called Wipeout.The Quick and The DeadWipeout was a anti gravity racer which saw you flying your.... erm.... (I don't know what it was... a ship? a hover-car? a pod-racer?.... ) Anyway you flew your ""thing"" around several different tracks at crazily fast speeds whilst trying not to bounce off the walls.You'd zoom over speed boosts, pick up weapons and try to blast your opponents out of the way.You had to be alert too because whilst you were trying to line up a shot on the racer in front, you can be sure that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your tail was trying to do exactly the same thing to you.It was an adrenaline fuelled rush and a huge amount of fun.You are not AloneIn the years that followed Wipeout spawned a sequel and there were other similar titles, POD, F-Zero, Rollcage etc. but it's still that first Wipeout title which springs to my mind when I hear the words ""Anti-Grav Racer"" and I've been hearing those words again recently in reference to a new game developed by 34BigThings. That game is Redout.You Oughta KnowRedout is, as you might have guessed from my pre-amble, an anti-grav racer and at the risk of spoiling the rest of this review, it's a very good one.If you've played Wipeout or any of the other antrigrav games out there then you'll know what to expect with Redout.First you'll select an AG ship.Want to drift stylishly around the bends or grip tightly to the track?Are you looking for something with a high top speed or maybe faster acceleration?There are several options available to suit your flying style.So unlike OJ Simpsons gloves, you'll have no problem finding the right fit.Lets GrooveNext you can choose to either fly a quick race (which does exactly what it says on the tin)  or you can play through the career mode.The career campaign will take you through over 100 events as you fly for your chosen racing team (there are six to choose from).Winning these events will reward you not only with medals but more importantly with experience and money which you can use to upgrade you ship.You can earn even more money and XP by taking and completing contracts, these come with certain requirements like complete track X using ship type Y, etc. and can be quite lucrative.The Usual SuspectsThe upgrade system is what you would expect from this type of game, with options to increase your acceleration, handling, top speed etc. Anything that can help you in a race is a good thing, the tracks can be quite tricky, Redout is by no means an easy game to master.Along with a host of mechanical ship upgrades there are also passive and active upgrade slots on your craft, you'll unlock various abilities as you play which you can switch around before each race to give you an additional edge.The events themselves are broken down into seven different categories, from score based endurance tests and arena challenges to traditional races, all of which take place on the 25+ tracks Redout offers.The tracks are well designed with plenty of variation from desert plains to frozen ice sheets, all offering their own unique challenges. As I said earlier, Redout is not an easy game.Don't Stop (Wiggle Wiggle)Your first time around any new track will likely see you bouncing off the ground and scraping around the bends, this doesn't just slow you down but can also damage and destroy your ship.Seeing your health bar drop down into the red as you scrape around the last bend of a race really adds to the tension, especially if you're in with a shot of actually winning.But if like R. Kelly, you ""don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind"", you can always upgrade your ship with better endurance to your ""dogems racing style"" or invest in some repair drones to keep you ""on track"".Beautiful in My EyesRedout is a good looking game with some spectacular lighting effects thanks to the Unreal 4 engine, however you're unlikely to really appreciate these graphical niceties as you tear around the tracks. It's a well optimised game which starts out fast and quickly moves onto eye-bleedingly-fast as you progress.FantasyThere is a background story to Redout, something to do with a post apocalyptic Earth, melted icecaps and humans that live on the moon who come back to the nest for a little AG racing fun.It's as flimsy as an OJ Alibi, It doesn't really matter and it doesn't get in the way, this is a racing game, your real story is ""win the race"" and that's enough motivation for me.Toy StoryFor those of you lucky enough to have access to a VR headset to strap on your face, Redout also works perfectly well in VR mode.I've played it on the Rift and whilst the game is already blisteringly fast on a monitor, the experience feels even faster in virtual reality and also brings the additional bonus of real life vomiting if you turn your head to the left or right whilst racing.In all seriousness, VR does add a lot to the immersion and whilst I'm lucky enough to have the option to play in VR, I still prefer to play Redout as an ""Old school"" monitor based racer,  but those less inclined to motion sickness who want to get some use out of their Rift or Vive whilst playing a ""real"" game and not a dressed up tech demo could do a lot worse than Redout in VR mode.Crimson TideRedout is an insanely fast anti-grav experience with impressive visuals and solid controls, if you're looking for a challenging arcade racer and are willing to put the time in to learn the twists and turns of each track then there's really only one contemporary option and that's Redout!Like the review and want to see more?

												Sorta rhymes with Wipeout, looks like Wipeout, sounds like Wipeout, feels like Wipeout, plays like Wipeout.This is an eager love letter to the Wipeout games, and it pulls it off. This is the Wipeout VR we were never going to get.If you wistfully remember pouring countless hours into Mega Mall, or pinning Icaras and Feisar posters on your wall, or wanting to work for The Design Republic... this is your game. Do it.Especially with a Vive.			",326,45,12,42,37,1,53

												At the time of this review, I'm about 25% into career mode.     So far, this game is on par with Wipeout and it kicks things up a couple notches in terms of speed and crazy tracks. Handling is a bit more like F-Zero, and can take a good deal of practice to get used to. I'm having a lot of fun playing this one and feel that its worth the price. Pros:- In-depth Career mode. 4 race classes, ship upgrades.Current Best Speed is 1,410mph. Yes, you read that right: MPH. You'll see those speeds on Class 2.- Passive and Active ""Weapon"" perks which are also upgradeable- Trippy looking race tracks with jumps and boost pads. - Fitting OST- Cool looking ships, some unique designs.Cons:- FPS drops on some tracks, usually near portals.- AI is a bit strange, tough some races and easy others, unpredictable driving patterns. - Has a higher learning curve then some games, but you do earn money if you lose. - Older computers will not be able to run this. I'm running it on low settings with 60% resolution.Things that would make this game epic:- Track Builder. So many games lack this feature, and i think having the ability to create, share and race yours and tracks others have created could be epic. - Custom OST - Allow us to race to our own music if we choose to.At its current state i would give this game a 7.5/10. Let the positive history of all the reviewers before me speak for themselves. I'd love to see what else devs include for the game in the future.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												TL;DR: The game is great, git gud and come play :D |9.1/10 overall|(Also, this is currently based mostly off career mode, havent played online aside from with friends)I don't review often, but after reading the literal garbage review of this game on PC Gamer (still unsure on that decision in the first place) I decided I should try and at least put some positivity back into this game to that crap being served up by those bribe-♥♥♥♥♥s at PCG.This game is fun, like serious fun. Best recommendation I can give, convince one or more of your friends to try it out with you and just have fun exploring the beautiful worlds, listening to some tasty jams, and tearing through whichever beautiful track you chose at approx. 1000 km/h. More on that:Gameplay: (A-) So you jump into game and woosh, R2 (or RT or w/e it is on keyboard controls) and you're flying down the track in your brand new Class I car. You're already going crazyballs fast, and then you think ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥..if this is a Class I car, how crazy fast is this gonna get?"" Oh it's gonna get really fast, you press another button and fwoosh you found your turbo boost buttonand suddenly you're going about 200 faster than you were about an instant ago. This game is FUN to learn and get better at.Honest simple answers, the controls aren't as tight as they are in some racing games, but for all the boohoos about tight controls HEY.......shh. You're barreling up, down, left, right and every other damn way the game can manage on a hovercar...that drifts...at stupid breakneck speeds. Yeah, there might be some wobble. It's k, the chance you might go offcourse to stab the nose of the vehicle into the side of some poor, undeserving mountain is half the fun.Between upgrades, vehicle choice, powerups (both passive and active), dual stick controls, a bunch of different courses, brifting and boosting, there is a surprising amount of depth to this game's mechanics.Music: (B) The music of this game gets a solid mark, but falls just a bit short...lemme explain. The music in this game, for the most part and to my knowledge and opinion, does its job. And the fact that I have to phrase it like that hurts a bit, but it is on the nose. The music is high energy electronic, that pulses and drops and feels perfect when it lines up with a loop or a huge boost or a huge jump. It doesn't get annoying too fast and thanks to the intense visual portion of the game, the but that the music falls short for the gameplay is overwritten by the strict attention you have to pay to the track.TL;DR: Not bad at all, but nothing stellar.Career Mode: (A) It doesn't beat you over the head by making you run the same track over and over, you don't have to grind for decades to get in-game money, in fact your money is even buffered by career events that award somewhere between 8-50k in-game (lowest and highest I've seen). Has some super fun ""BOSS"" tracks (Don't look em up, save the fun <3) that will make you say ""woah"" out loud, even if it's just under your breath or whatever. Pretty much all my game time has been in career mode, and more hours are gonna get dumped there. Moral of the story: A career mode that showcases everything the game has to offer in a raw, no hand-holdy way. Oh and to comment on it as most have, yes the AI in this game can be downright brutal, but it isn't fun if you win every time, eh?Other Notes: FREAKING PATCH NOTES. Seriously, this came as a surprise, but hey, not too shabby to have a game get mostly BALANCE patching, with a couple of bugfixes of course, just one week after launch. Plus the peeps at 34BT seem to have a pretty decent correspondence with the community. Not stellar, but the fans gotta reach out too. :3Plus, while the phrase seems to mean less and less every day, this is a smaller developer, trying to bring us a fresh, fun game that, obviously, a lot of people sorely missed. I know I did.Overall, this game is a beautiful homage to a lot of hyper-racing games of old, it's fast, it's fun and it's waiting for you to grab yourself a copy and start breaking some speed records. I'd give the game a solid 9.1/10 overall.And for anyone who read any (or heaven help you all) of this, hope it helped, thanks kindly, and much love. <3 -FmD			",186,31,2,38,3,0,10

												Redout is an anti-gravity racing game that claims to be a tribute to F-Zero and WipeOut, and it has largely delivered.The game communicates the thrill of racing very well; you don't really need big numbers on the HUD to know you are going fast when you can feel the speed by the vibrations of the ship and the scenery blurring into the background. Controls are tight but can be a challenge to handle on more complex corners (pitching and strafing). Soundtrack adds to the atmosphere and apparently adapts to the speed (haven't noticed this yet).The AI in Career Mode is challenging to say the least. They are very aggresive and rarely commit mistakes. They also think every race is a demolition derby as they crash into each other and me frequently. This often causes me to suffer a speed penalty and drop to last. I'm not sure if this is the intended behaviour but I believe it could be toned down a bit.The control scheme supports both keyboard and gamepad, but none of them are rebindable which is unfortunate. I use the keyboard and the WASD keys are used for accelerating and turning while the arrow keys are used for pitching and strafing. The boost button is bound to Left Shift which can get quite painful if using the pinky. I am also used to steering with the arrow keys so getting used to the Redout controls was a challenge in itself as well.Overall Redout is a great game that deserves more attention, even disregarding its niche. The mechanics are well designed and the gameplay really conveys the sense of speed, which is important in a racing game. I am hopeful the developers will address the issues in a timely manner (especially the rebinding) as they do appear in the forums fairly often.			",249,92,14,24,26,1,28

One of the best plug and play seated VR experiences I've had and one of the few VR games that feels complete and robust.Channels Wipeout in all the right ways, controls are responsive, challenging AI, smooth multiplayer.If you are at all considering this game on the VR front don't hesitate if you like arcade racing a la all the classic console series.

												As a big fan of AG racing games (Fzero X my love), I was very enthusiastic when I saw that release on steam, and I haven't been disappointed. The game has very good graphics and the speed sensation is awesome. The tracks designs are inspired and the different ships controls feel great. At first, the game can seem really hard, your first races aren't gonna make you pleased, but if you persist you'll find a very rewarding progression.I love it, the career mode is fun and the online mode is a great plus. That first time when I unlocked a platinum medal made me so excited, feeling my own skill improved.A must have for any arcade racing lover.			",772,172,49,41,45,9,73

												This is absolutely flawless. To my knowledge, this is the only time a game has exceeded it's ""spiritual ancestor""; Wipeout was a fantastic game, but is clearly beaten by this awesome experience. Track design is flawless and wonderful. Ship design is solid, music is passable (though lacking some of the heady heights of wipeout '97), but the environments, depth of gameplay and tracks make for a simply unbeaten game. Heck, even the game modes are incredible - Boss mode in particular. 10/10 would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game melted my face and forced me to eat it!On a serious note, it's fantastic; smooth frame rates and a nice feeling while going round the track. You are not ground to a halt if you hit the side, but the slow down will cost you valuable time. This game does not just hand over golds like a teacher in a school for the underprivaledged, nope it makes you work for them. The career mode feels a little basic but there is a lot to it; time trials, races, lvl progression, ship and upgrade unlocks. The graphics are amazing in places but functional in others (the ships themselves are low on detail but they have a style to them that i like), and the sparks and effects just heighten a great sense of speed and flow through the race... well until you smash into a building on the first jump (yup I did that).The Multiplayer works and I had 4 races with no problems; although I think it's P2P as I lost the host after 4 games. That said, it worked smoothly (even if I raced badly XD ) and was a blast. At the time of writing there were not many players, but hey its day one on a game that hasn't been hyped (but it should be, it is a solid title).To sum up, if you like games like Wipeout, Extreme G or F-Zero then you will probably like it; I know I do.

												Great skill based hover racing game. The more time you put in, the more you get out of it. Getting a hang of the controls feels extremely rewarding. Plenty of Pros and most of the Cons are subjective/could be fixed with an expansion or patch.Pros:-Tight responsive controls-Well designed tracks with plenty of verticality-High skill ceiling-Around 20 different tracks-Excellent sound design responds to your gameplay-Plenty of different vehicles and classesCons:-Few music tracks, becomes repetitive-4 track themes. Could be expanded for more variety-Only 3 control schemes, no custom key bindings-Lack of balanced powerups. You will end up only using 4 or 5 of the total 10 (12?) options-Limited vehicle customization. Just pre-set color schemes. There are a good number of these, but something like custom colors, or custom logos would be really niceOnce again, very good game, the Pros definitely outweigh the Cons, and I look forward to the dev's continued work on this game, especially if it can address some of the Cons.

												This is easily the closest any racing game I've played has ever come to matching the fun of F-Zero GX.I haven't tried playing with a keyboard, but at least for a controller there are a handful of control schemes to pick your favorite of. The default works well once you're used to it (dual-stick controls are new to me for a game like this), but you can also swap to a more ""classic"" A-To-Go scheme if you're more familiar with F-Zero on consoles.Graphics are fantastic. Each track looks stunning. Music goes well with the tracks (definitely recommend the OST).Difficulty seems just right. There's a bit of focus on picking the right passive/active powerups, or ship, for the right track, which might rub some people the wrong way (I know many people who always played the same machine in F-Zero), but by the same mechanic, you have more room to customize your machine than just ""Do I want speed or acceleration?""Career mode is paced nicely for learning the tracks and winning the races. Multiplayer with friends is fun, but it's the career mode where the game shines brightest.			",182,23,1,36,14,1,41

												WipeOut...the very reason I first bought a playstation nearly 20 years ago. Played it to death and loved it. It was a very hard learning curve and Redout is just as unforgiving. The game is fast, very fast and on a GTX1070 it runs like a dream. I've only had a few races and just started the career mode but my initial impression is that I will be playing this to the end. I love it and I can only imagine what the VR must be like because playing this on a big monitor..my head is spinning. Awesome!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I trace back to F-Zero for the SNES, to the wonderful Wipeout 2097 that stunned the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me, and its big brother on the N64. Although then came Extreme-G for the N64 as well, and I was madly addicted to that game as well (although not a AG game, its extremely fast paced racing and loopy insane tracks was no less different). Then trackmania slowly came in to my collecting of insane racing, and I cannot express how much time and love I've had for that series. It was then nice to see Wipeout HD Fury come for the PS3 as well. My bloody point is that it's truly nice to see an AG game return, and just take all the elements from all these games, and just refine it so nicely. The tracks are just so nicely layed out, the pacing is fast as you'd expect, and the variety of vehicles and upgrades are a nice addition. The visuals is another top notch, but Unreal Engine 4 never fails to disappoint (I just wish I can disable some of those post-processing effects).It's a wonderful game, but challenging as well. You'll be frustrated, no doubt. These games are just pure fun and rageful. I am hoping for more content (DLC even) for this game, and hopefully the patches can iron the game out a little more. But right now, it's a polished crazy fun AG game, and worth your time investment if you are a fan of any of those games mentioned up there. I also hope that the AI is ironed out a bit, as they are insanely difficult in one front, and insanely easy on the other front. Maybe add some kind of easy>norma>hard>nightmare thing, you know? Now buy it and go have fun.Toots.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Redout is a futuristic anti-gravity racing game, very much inspired by games like F-Zero and Wipeout. For those who may not have played a similar game, you race in ships that hover just above the ground on tracks that defy gravity with loops and huge jumps. Since you have no contact with the ground, the physics are very different to regular racing games and require you to think differently as you approach different parts of the track. Each ship can 'strafe' left or right, which allows you to very noticably change the angle of your ship mid-corner. Learning to use this is crucial and does take a bit of time to adjust to, particularly if you're more used to the airbrake system used in F-Zero and Wipeout. You can also adjust the pitch of your craft's nose, which leads me onto the title of the game. A 'Redout' occurs when too much blood rushes to the brain from negative G-Force. In the game this means that when you suffer negative G-Force you need to adjust the angle of your nose to prevent a redout, which makes the entire screen turn red and makes it difficult to see. You can also blackout through positive G-Force.There are several game modes. Race (does what you think), Time Trials, Last Man Standing (the last place ship on each lap is eliminated), Survival (your ship health drains over time) and Boss (which is a series of tracks chained together through teleporters). There are also 'Pure' races where no powerups are allowed. I should point out now that Redout is HARD. Particularly in the first few races it really feels like the AI rubberband but I've seen arguments for both sides on this. You need to be on the top of your game to even place on the podium until you've earned enough for ship upgrades.Visually the game is beautiful. Even on lower settings it looks amazing and the sense of speed when you're racing is the best of any racing game I've played. The interface in menus is a bit clunky but its a minor complaint. The soundtrack is a bit of a mixed bag but mostly adrenaline-pumping which suits this genre of game perfectly.Complaints are few and far between but there are some areas I'd like to see improved. The options menu is incredibly sparse (there is no option for Window mode in-game and you can't manually rebind controls). The difficulty is going to put off some people, and I genuinely think that the first few races need the AI nerfing as it's really punishing for newer players. It would also be nice for a wider variety of tracks and ships. There are a good amount of tracks but only 4 locations so the scenery gets old pretty fast. Likewise there are a few different teams and each team has a few ships but within a team all the ships look very similar, as opposed to something like F-Zero.Overall though I'm a massive fan of Redout. If you even slightly liked F-Zero or Wipeout you will probably love this. Get past the difficulty curve and it's incredibly rewarding. Between this and BallisticNG the anti-gravity racing scene has really come into its own again.			",47,5,14,10,6,0,8

												Anyone that is a fan of the futuristic racing genre needs to buy Redout ASAP. I didn't care so much for FAST Racing Neo on Wii U so I was hesitant to dip my toes on another indie game in the beloved genre, but the demo and a Steam sale made me give it a try. I am glad I did.Redout is aiming high when it says it's trying to honor Wipeout, F-Zero, and other games that define the genre. You can see the influence of these games and others through the different ship manufacturers. Thankfully, the tribute is more the superficial, because this game delivers a pure racing experience. It ticks all the boxes it needs to (asethetics, lore, velocity) but more importantly it manages to be something new and unique.The best way to describe the gameplay is that it is a twin-stick racer. Like the twin-stick shooter, using and mastering the two joysticks of a modern controller is absolutely necessary to do well in this game. (An X360 or equivalent gamepad is pretty much required to play well.) Like in the Wipeout series, you can control the pitch (nose angle) of your hovercraft. However, the circuits in Redout take the vertical aspect of track design to absurdity. You will be turning up and down just as much as you will be turning left and right, and the game's control setup respects this.It's preferable that you learn the default control scheme, where you steer on the left stick and control pitch and strafe on the right stick. (Wipeout-style controls are available, but I wouldn't recommend them. Also, you can't customize anything unless you use the Steam client's controller config menus.) There's a learning curve with the strafe controls, which aren't like airbrakes. After you begin to understand how strafe can be used with, against, or without steering inputs, it offers fine-control abilities unlike any other game I've played.There's great satisfaction when navigating a complex set of horizontal and vertical turns without slamming into the walls. That's not to say you will ever get good enough to not graze/hit walls constantly. Shield management and collision avoidance is part of the game. This can be frustrating, as well as can the disoriating blackout/redout effects when you fail to pitch on extreme vertical changes. However, it makes it all the better when you finally discover the right timing of turn, pitch, throttle and strafe to make it through a hard section. It feels like you're really piloting a true hovercraft.The main attraction of Redout is the raw sense of speed it offers, and critically, the stable 60+ framerate it maintains under all circumstances. The only other 60+ game like this I've played that lets you go unlimitedly fast without a performance drop was F-Zero GX on the GameCube, and that game was bloody impressive. Redout is five times more impressive than that. The visual sensations of speed and direction change in this game can get so overwhelming, turning down/off the motion blur in the options is a must in the higher speed classes. There can be a game where too fast is too much, and Redout is that game. (That's a good thing.)My chief complaint about Redout is the (current) lack of multiplayer options. There's no local multiplayer. There is online multiplayer, but with the relatively small playerbase finding players when you want is impossible. Being an indie title, I have some hope that the upcoming console releases (PS4/XB1/Switch) will enable PC crossplay of some kind to help boost the online population for everyone. I would also caution how tracks don't always standout from the background environment, which makes reading ahead difficult until you can half-memorize the tracks. (You will never completely memorize them.)My bottom line: If you want something new in the racing genre, Redout is for real.			",59,11,6,4,7,0,6

												Saw a game that looked like F-Zero X, my favorite racing game of all time. Bought it, went to some lengths to set up my crappy wireless 3rd party ps3 controller, and got it working. Put on the full OST from F-Zero X, and played.Best climax I've had in my life.In all seriousness, the game is a blast. It's challenging, won't hold your hand any more than is sensible, and has tight controls. So when you lose, you have no one but yourself to blame. Definitely worth the asking price, as I've no doubt I'll be getting my money's worth out of this one.Edit: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Starting at the class 2 tier, the AI really makes you sweat for those ♥♥♥♥ing gold medals. I love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing this via a family sharing.The game is fun fun fun fun. Pure, unadulterated fun. An extremely organic racing experience.The sense of speed is on point, the cars handle decently, the tracks are awesome.The AI is sometimes taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥with how easily they can catch up and overtake you, and you can easily spin out when someone rams you from behind, but i appreciate that it's a challenge and doesn't handhold you. You ain't gonna be getting gold medals easily, that's for sure.Would i buy if i had to? Absolutely (as long as it's under $20 because i'm ♥♥♥♥ing broke, man)			",25,5,1,0,1,0,3

												This is the coolest, fastest racing game I've played in a long time. I've played F-Zero GX in the past but that game was more about twitch reflexes while this is more about learning to control the different ships to properly make turns without losing too much speed.However, I have to be honest here: the price of $38.69 is way too much given that you can get many other games to the same degree of polish as this for much less. I feel the price is the sole reason this game does not have a big playerbase. I had to go through hoops to find people to play online with. Many of my friends are interested in this game but do not want to purchase due to the price.It was a very nice treat to be given 5 new tracks in a new environment, which essentially gave us 25% more game, but unless there are 40 tracks total I feel this game deserves a nice price cut to give it more exposure, and give us more players to play with.

												If you liked the racing model of Wipeout XL, you'll enjoy Redout. It nails the same feeling of trying to nail that Perfect Lap, the dream where your path around the track would resemble a lovely Bézier curve. You'll feel at one with your ship as it slides around curves and every bump against a wall feels like it could have been avoided had you taken the last turn a little tighter, or looser, or faster, etc. Basically, it feels like you have absolute control of your craft unlike other AG games where you feel like you're at the mercy of it's driving model. I don't know anything about the pedigree of the development team but there is clearly a passion for AG racing games there and it comes through in every aspect of the game, not just in it's driving model but in the clean art style and unobtrusive UI, making it clear that the racing comes first. The soundtrack also does a great job of setting the mood and while it's no FSOL, it is aggressive and energetic without being grating or tiring after a few laps. There are no traditional weapons in the game. You get two power-ups, one passive (i.e. better grip or energy recharge) and one active. The active (manually activated) powerups are more defensive in nature, mostly allowing you to leech and freeze energy levels of opponent craft, or protect your own, etc. That said, it's probably a good thing you don't have to watch out for mines, electro-volts, or turtle shells, because handling your craft and is a full-time job and can take quite a bit of concentration as the game moves tremendously fast. My only real complaint with the game thus far is the AI, which is abnormally aggressive at times. You'll definitely get knocked around the track a lot in the beginning, and you should expect to lose a race here and there through some questionable AI tactics. Other than that, Redout already feels like it could be a classic for the genre.			",46,3,2,1,1,0,1

												Oh man, this brings back memories!! :DI used to play sonic riders as a kid and while this game isn't exactly the same thing (i.e no grinding on rails, super moves, etc.) it's still fantastic. I know comparing it to sonic riders makes me look like a casual but man oh man do I enjoy this game!!There's the true sense of speed with no obstacles that's so amazing about this game; it's a speed rush that you don't get in normal racing games like nfs, etc. this is pure speed.Thank you devs for making such an incredible game.

												The best sci-fi / anti gravity racing game I've played since F-Zero GX and Wipeout HD. I honestly never thought I'd see a game in this genre hit such a high quality benchmark again. The ship handling and track design is excellent.If you have any fond memories of the anti-gravity racers growing up do yourself a favour and pick this one up.			",265,53,12,25,31,4,54

												If you're like me then you're not so happy that Nintendo doesn't care about F-Zero and Sony shut down Studio Liverpool so there's no more Wipeout. Sure, you've explored older crazy fast racing games, and maybe you even picked up Fast Racing Neo on the WiiU, but that's still not enough. Then a ray of light shines through the clouds, and suddenly you are bathed in the glory of Redout.Inspired by crazy fast racing games of yore but with ideas and ambitions of its own Redout is a fine adition to the family of AG racers. With a large amount of even types, 6 ship types to pick from with 4 tiers each, an equippiable (and upgradeable) passive and active skill for those non-pure events, and 4 stat categories that you can upgrade, 4 track themes each with a multitude of unique feelings tracks, a seemingly Wipeout inspired soundtrack but with compositions set to fit the track rather than on a playlist, VR support, top-notch visual presentation and a feeling of speed I've been wanting to experience for a long long time Redout is a must buy for any fans of the genre, especially those wanting this type of game to make its way back to PC.My only two complaints are that you can't place bots in online multiplayer matches (So that is only 2 other people are in the lobby you can still fill out the other slots until new players join) and you can't fully customize gamepad controls. Why isn't LB set to use your active power-up? Why X?TLDR; I've had a fantastic time with Redout, its full of great stuff, futuristic racing fans should pick it up.			",369,92,7,49,45,4,95

												Furiously fast, floaty, fantastic, with some frost!Redout is a game where you go really fast on antigravity speeders in the future, like, really fast. (And you have boost on top of that, too)Redwine's controls are very floaty on purpose, and it doesn't really feel that much like a car. It definitely feels like you're floating. You aren't completely disconnected from your direction of travel, though, it's just more distant than usual. In Redwood you can race in a bunch of modes on tracks located in Cairo, Egypt; Alaska; Abruzzo, Italy (kinda), and a Volcanic region, with each increasing in difficulty in the order I listed, kinda... This is because each region also has its own difficulty curve with the available tracks in the region, which you unlock as you progress in the Career mode.For weapons, Redwire has some, but they are not directly offensive. For example, there is a beam that allows you to drain the boost energy from an opponent and use it to fill yours, a passive shield that hard counters the previously mentioned beam, and a more powerful boost that lets you go much faster, in exchange for dumping your entire energy pool into it all at once, to name a few. You definitely won't be shooting rockets at people or leaving behind spikes, though. These power-ups are not pickups, and are equipped before a race starts. There are also passive powerups that you use to accompany the active powerups, with things like making your boost more efficient, increasing grip, making you respawn faster, etc. This is on top of being able to buy upgrades for your ship. There is also a ""Pure Race"" mode that does not allow powerups.Redcard has online multiplayer as well, but not split screen. The online multiplayer is rather dead at the moment of writing this review, I hope it picks up. There will be split screen in the future, as the devs have mentioned before, but for now it's just you and the AI, or online people.What I really, really like about Redalert is that after sort-of getting the hang of the floaty ships, turning early etc, it is an absolute blast to play. I love the feeling of speed, and the floaty ships actually makes it feel more fun to drive.I definitely recommend Redflag to anyone who thinks this will fit their interests. But if the floaty ships don't do it for you, don't get it, because they are not cars, get a car game instead.			",119,15,4,6,9,2,11

												I am a big fan of WipeOut, starting with Pure and progressing through HD and Fury.  I was the kind of guy who got golds on all career events in that game.  I was a bit wary of this game not meeting my expectations, and other than the radical graphic design of all the team names, this game totally lives up.For those worrying about performance (hitting and maintining 60FPS is absolutely key in these AG arcade games), I have a GTX 670 and this game defaulted to all Epic settings (ha) and maintains 60FPS without even a hesitation.  It's funny, because I would hazard a guess that it runs on Unreal, which is nothing if not optimized.I would love a pure Zones mode, but that would be a straight rip-off of WipeOut, and the Score mode here isn't far off...

												Would I reccomend you pay $35 for it if you aren't a big racing fan? No.However, it is the closest to a F-Zero type racing game that has come out... Well, since F-Zero.It's challenging, engrossing, fun, and gorgeous. It's a fantastic racing game that I will play for many more hours. The AI is actually challenging and the handling of ships takes practice to master. The courses are extremely varied and there's no lack of creativity. I don't feel like I'm doing the same thing over and over at any point.But again, it's $35 for a singleplayer arcade racing game. I personally have had a thirst for a good racing game recently since there has been none (thanks NFS for sucking), so this quenched it thoroughly. However if you aren't big into the racing genre or a fan of F-Zero, wait for it to go on sale.Otherwise, definitely purchase it. I see myself getting a good 30+ hours out of this before I start to get bored of it/not play it frequently. Tons of courses and ships to master.EDIT: There is a multiplayer mode, but I have yet to be able to find a single match with other people online, which is why I said it is a singleplayer game. Which is fine, because it excels at what it does in SP. I think the game just doesn't have a big enough playerbase to consistently find MP games.			",171,17,5,10,5,0,7

												VR Review: HTC Vive + GTX 1070Summary: Well overall I really like the game itself and it does stay true to the titles it mentions in the description.  The racing mechanics are slick as hell and it has pretty deep gameplay compared to any other VR racer I've seen. So far my max jump distance is 1.2 miles! So it combines flight and racing with VR which is AWESOME to experience!Ships/Racers: The ships themselves, I'd guess there at least 50-60 based on what I saw flipping through (bare min guess there) and each ship has 5 upgrade categories I think. Then you have an active and passive powerup you can select from, all of these have multiple levels up benefits to the ships. You unlock more and more as you get higher in levels from racing.  MP: I can't comment on the MP yet because I haven't used it.  Will update this once I do.Tracks: I haven't been far enough into the game yet to say anything about the tracks overall.  However I can say the tracks I used were extremely fun, yet challenging. I know they will only get harder as we go on. I just hit my first two tracks that allow you to choose your path due to  a large jump/flying and you can either keep flying to a higher track or land (I am a level 5 pilot right now).Graphics: I'd put this up there with one of the top 10-15 best looking VR games I have played and if we are talking about racing games, it's probably the best next to Project Cars which is nearly impossible for most people to run at decent settings in VR. I am able to do it somewhat with a watercooled MSI GTX 1070 Armor.Audio: After getting the 5.1 surround to turn on I was very impressed with the fidelity of the audio tracks and the music isn't as annoying as some of the older titles mentioned in the description, haha.Now here are the issues I ran into trying to play the game:1) Game has crashed and caused my system to need to be restarted three separate times. Even when I don't get a crash and I just close the game once I want to stop, it freezes SteamVR and I have to restart it. 2) Also there are menu options shown when you select ""Play RedOut Steam VR Mode"" in the menus an option says ""Max FPS"" if you just touch that option usually it will freeze the game and crash SteamVR. Only that option gives me a problem.  3) Why do I have to set my sound as 5.1 each time I enter the game?  Is this due to the Vive's onboard USB audio that I have disabled?? Surely it's not defaulting to a specific sound device in the game just because you tell it you are using a Vive...  I have to go through this process each time I play if I want surround sound.Ideas for devs to improve the (VR) title:Incorporate motion controller and possibly even room scale for the HTC Vive (sliding in chair from left to right could be strafe for example), although really just the motion controllers part.  It would be pretty neat if that could be hashed out due to the degrees of freedom available to utilize and having two controllers vs. one. Try to make the in cockpit views more detailed with more hindrance from the windshield on that view selection, it's the point of picking it. Nothing is wrong with how it looks now, but I think if the windshield had a negative effect such as sunlight or rain, that could help make it more immersive (at least as an option).Overall it's a great title and I'd recommend it for anyone with VR who enjoys games mentioned in the description or someone with VR who still is looking for a REAL game.

 VR Review  Reviewed on Vive This is one of the most immersive VR games as of yet. Only a small space is required as there is no roomscale and it can be played sitting without the need for motion controllers. I used an Xbox One controller. It's one of the first VR games that isn't just a shallow tech demo or wave game. It boasts a career, online a quick play mode. In the career you can play a variety of maps in different gamemodes such as race and time attack and win contracts to upgrade your ship with money earned. There a quite a few different camera angles which is nice, such as bonnet view, cockpit view and third person view. I find that bonnet view is the best for VR in my opinon if you're going for the best time, but cockpit view is more immersive. The game itself pays homage to titles like F-Zero with a kinetic, gliding playstyle that makes you feel like you're in Star Wars.It's a must have for VR.I also want to add that it performs extremely well. I could run it at maximum framerate on normal settings at 150% upscaling with a GTX 970, i5 4690 and 16GB RAM.			",101,12,3,9,13,0,4

												Redout is probably one of the better futuristic racers that came out in the past years. This game nails the feeling of fast rather nicely and you will go fast rather frequently unless you flat out suck at the game. There is a fair amount of teams to pick form. Each has their own unique design and performance and there will be one that will fit your play style as well as upgrades and augments that will help counteract your ships weaknesses. There isn't that many different locations but each location has a fair amount of tracks all varying in style and difficulty, In terms of visuals, absolutly stunning low poly graphics that make excelent use of relfections. Now the downsides, I have three main complaints. The first is the difficulty. At first it as rather difficult but then it became stupidly easy. I don't know if its because I'm that good or the AI sucks that much later on but each race becomes a time trial no matter what the game mode might be. Another issue is a lack of conistant multiplayer. There are maybe one server once in a while and the players that do race are not very good. The last is the ""weapons"". The weapons are minor inconvenaces or flat out useless except for the boost upgrade that lets you use all of your energy for one big powerful boost. In the end, 8/10			",167,9,11,12,13,2,9

Product received for free
 Redout: Enhanced Edition  Right off the bat you can tell that this game is beautiful. The vivid, kaleidoscope of colours really helps it stand out from other games on the market. I have never played a lot of racing games but having Nvidia kindly send a code I couldn't not play this.  Gameplay  Brakes? What brakes?The fundamentals of this game are on the hover cars that are each different (made by different companies) that determine their stats such as toughness, energy storage or speed. Therefore, the way you race will depend on the car you choose.Even so, the hovering mechanic means that corners rely heavily on planning and reaction time that makes it difficult to get used to since there is almost no drifting and so the use of boosting to squeeze out makes it more interesting. The idea of hover cars also allow for vertical turning also. This means you must turn upwards to go around a loop the loop for example which adds more diversity and skill to the already fast paced game style. Undeniably, you will reach high speeds and make it more difficult to control, but... That's where the fun is. I felt I should mention the music here since it is different for each zone and truly captures the aesthetic of the location and action of the racing that truly stood out in my opinion. A con with such high speeds is that it'd take a fairly decent computer to cope with the amounts of screen blur and textures zooming past as you weave through corners to win your well deserved gold. It also makes it difficult to take in the beautiful scenery that the game has to offer.The option for VR is also available, however, due to me not having any form of this you will have to take a look for yourself if you were interested as from what I've heard, it's something to definitely try. Career mode  The main focus of the game. It allows you to level up your character and earn money to purchase upgrades and new cars that each belong to companies that go from classes 1-4. The races include varieties of game modes such as ""Time attack"" which is your stand need for speed cliché. There are also other game modes that require more personalised vehicles to win such as ""Survival"" which is truly a challenge. The A.I is also a neat addition that provides a nice challenge to the multiple races you'll go through to progress. More often than not you will be matched fairly in 1st place and any failures will cost you 3rd or even more since the speeds you travel at make it almost impossible to catch up, especially in more difficult tracks. Additionally, the A.I often knocks you out at the very beginning as they rush past in the one life modes that can be fairly difficult to deal with at times. Despite this, different zones and tracks in those zones are often very entertaining to drive around as you slowly master them and win your tournaments like a true champ. After 6 hours of career, I never felt bored of racing through the tracks as the variety of places gave all the tracks a unique feel that were decently laid out. Later on, however,  Customizability  The game lets you earn money for winning races and allows a fairly quick progression that increases the difficulty each race making it more necessary to buy upgrades for that class of ship. There are also power-ups in this game that you are able to buy but are not picked up like you woul find in Mario Kart. Instead you have an active power up that activates when you press a designated key and also a passive that is always active and both can be upgraded to a maximum of 4. From my experience, they are only truly necessary for extra speed and sometimes the other game modes but I never found myself experimenting with different combinations, even so, they are important in the later stages of the game and may make the beginning easier. It is also worth mentioning the different models of the ships that are very pretty to the eye and have colour customization available.  Online  Due to a lack of friends, I have not had a chance to test the feature out but due to the timings of your laps being compared globally as well as your friends I imagine it would allow you to compare your friends' career times and earn bragging rights.  Summary  All in all, I believe this game to be a fantastic entrance to the racing genre with it's beautiful style and lights to the fascinating, fast-paced gameplay. I could not say much for replayability as you would expect in most racing games and the sale price may not be everyone's treat but if you were looking for something to sink your teeth into, Redout surely offers a great start to the genre as well as offering other options like VR.

My eyes are dry now. I've spent the last hour not blinking or TRYING to not blink!Redout. It came from nowhere and screaming along at speeds that, in any sane world, would rack up speed tickets at the rate of pounds per second, be rightly dismissed as the sport of lunatics. Anti grav racing? But that died out with Wipeout? Wipeout HD and Fury on the Playstation 3 got that nailed and then Sony went and shuttered the studio, forever killing the dreams of futuristic racing! There's been pretenders to the crown, and there's been promise in the form of Formula Fusion, made by the very same people who developed Wipeout in the first place, but realistically? It ded. Dey killed it.Then Redout appears. It blazes out of the gate with style, with a design and artistic approach all of it's own, rather than going for lots of visual noise it keeps things simple, but at the same time visually appealing, lots of flat, but colourful polygons, creating a sort of ""Lo-fi"" approach that will run at a very smooth framerate once you've figured out just what detail setting you can get away with. The first thing you notice is just how -fast- this thing goes, this isn't just floaty sleds on a track, this is doing loop the loops at closing on 1,000 k/mh, this is vaulting into the sky at speeds that shouldn't even be *possible*, and with turns that require you to react on near instinctual levels.Antigrav racing taken back to the fundamentals and then purified to a very raw, crystaline formRedout doesn't really do weapons, there are some, such as a leech and an EMP, but critically you get to choose what your loadout is before you even begin the race. This means there's an element of tactics in the game, rather than praying to RNGesus you get a shockwave off of a weapons pad. This means you're wieghing up the choices before the race even begins, and working out what will best serve you in the race ahead, once you've a few actives and passives unlocked, you'll be changing loadouts around regularly.Each racer gets to pick one active and one passive, the passive can be simple stuff like a flat boost to a given stat, or it can be a conditional such as a bigger boost but only when in an opponents wake. Whereas the active is something you have to set off, and it takes from a shared ""energy pool"" that's also used for boosting, so you have to make discrete choices as to when it's time to use your active, and when it's time to get that extra kick of speed. (In the case of the Turbo, you get to choose whether to use some energy for a little boost, or to hold off and fill the bar to 360BLAZEIT for a giant whack out of the Turbo)Repairing is done automatically, provided you didn't dink either the course or another racer after a few seconds, with the hull bar creeping up ever so slowly once the repair routines kick in, at the speeds you're charging around the track in, those precious few seconds of hull can often make the difference between life and death, occasionally you may even want to slow to draw out as much repair as possible, being mindful all the time of your opponents.It's all very well thought out, with an eye to keeping you constantly focussed on the track and your opponents, because the speed at which the game goes is real ""Blink and you'll miss it"" stuff.A very high bar to set from a very new studioThere's areas where I can, and will nitpick, being someone who deeply loved the Wipeout series. First and foremost is the fact the teams lack ""definition"" at this point, they're nice to unlock and they have different stats, but I don't really feel what sets them apart from one another, that might be something to delve into with more worldbuilding and background. There's bugs (such as the Top speed on vehicles plummeting when you buy the Acceleration upgrade) but those will get patched out). The multiplayer is a work in progress (but they know that), and the Career could do with more ""structure"" (There's a lot of it, but it's very flat in how it rolls out).However, does any of this detract from what is an amazing game? Nope. Does any of this take away from the fact we've FINALLY GOT A WORTHY AG RACER ON PC? Nope.About. Damn. Time. Thank you devs. We now have a proper AG racer.Verdict : Highly Recommended ",1647,571,92,264,280,18,321

												Incredibly fast, brutally difficult, technically sound, and amazingly beautiful. Played Wipeout, F-Zero, or the Star Wars Pod Racer before? Feel right at home with this one. No hand-holding included. If it wasn't for the adrenaline-killing, killjoy voice of the announcer after every race, this would have been perfect. Still a great game to recommend.

												Finally someone put Wipeout on PCI've been on the lookout for a decent Wipeout clone ever since I first got a PC. Redout popped up as a new release and I figured I'd download it and if it wasn't good enough I could refund it. Well, no need to have worried, it's fantastic. The all-important feeling of speed is certainly there, the tracks are exciting and fiendish, the ships beautifully designed. There's an upgrade system to the ships allowing the player to improve their current ship and also buy new ones from the same stable. Rather than picking up weapons on the track, you purchase them (and also performance enhancers) - one to be triggered at the user's discretion and one to act passively throughout the race. These additions can also be upgraded using the in-game currency you earn from racing.It's not an easy game, there is a learning curve to each vehicle and each track. However it's not so difficult that a little applied playing won't give you the feel of the jet that you need to place well in the races and time trials. Different restrictions are applied to events to add even more interest to this pedal-to-the-metal racer. On top of all this, the whole game is gorgeous, even down to the loading icon. The Trance-like background music is pretty much exactly what one would want as well.A special thank you goes to 34BigThings for coding it such that you can INSTANTLY replay a track without it having to reinitialise. I really appreciate this, it bugs me no end when I want to replay a level in a game and it takes just as long to start as if I'd chosen a new one.I absolutely love this game and if you're a fan of Wipeout or F-Zero or both, you should grab it immediately. To my mind, it is an instant classic.			",44,10,3,0,1,0,2

Product received for free
Steam key provided by the developer for review.Scorecard:http://i.imgur.com/d0uPHGw.pngFull review with screenshots:http://www.techfreshness.com/game-review-redout/  Feature Y/N/Rating   Aspect Ratios 16:9, wider crops vertically w/o ini fix   Framerate Cap Unlimited, optional steps between 30 and 240   SLI No   Performance Good   Options Above Average, but missing a few things   Key Rebinding No   Controller Support/Rebinding Yes, No   Multiplayer Online (12 Players) PC Port QualityRes and win/full/borderless only available in config files. In game has v-sync toggle, variable framerate cap, and resolution scale [40-100%]. Graphics options incl. AA, textures, effects, shadows, view distance, and post processing bundles a number of things but motion blur was separated out in patch 1. Ship and screen HUDs can be toggled, but certain things like trial timings will still show. FOV adjustment for each of the views would be welcome.Keyboard and Xinput controllers are supported simultaneously (mouse does nothing), button prompts are switched in the menu. No rebinding (said to be in the works) or axis inversion other than 3 preset controller layouts. All movements support analog, but the speed/frequency of turns means it's not as essential as it is to say a racing sim. It's still very satisfying and can be played competently with just the keyboard, I even preferred it in the end. Only issue is that that camera rotation isn't bound, so you also can't rotate the ships in the menu without the controller.No SLI support, but can be forced through Nvidia Inspector for +25-30%. Performance is good for the visuals on offer, and it scales well enough, the lowest settings pushing ~40-60% more frames vs maxed.GameplayIncredible speed, and you're given the control to make it around even the challenging tracks without dropping your momentum. Where Wipeout controls like a snowboard, somewhat rigid in the direction you point, Redout gives you constant strafe control and is overall much more slidey. You can use it to simply reposition around the track, to assist you by pushing into the turn, or to over-steer early and strafe/drift around. Depending on your ship choice you can use it for different things, but you'll need to learn to use it regardless if you want to set decent times.3 Boosts: Controlled release via ship energy, a large boost for 100% energy while using a certain ability, and boost gates around the track. The 6 ship teams all have their own sets of attributes that allow you to turn in different ways, take more damage, regain energy, etc. Passives abilities basically augment those attributes, so you can double down or go for a more balanced approach, while actives do some of the same things in a time-limited form while either spending all of or draining your energy over time.You can't manually lift off the track at any time like Wipeout, but there are plenty of jumps, some of which require you to take them at a specific angle or pitch your ship correctly to land soon/late enough to avoid obstacles. Pitch is also needed to avoid grinding your nose during loops/hills, and becoming unstable in reverse loops and sharp declines.Everything available in the career is also available as quick/custom races from the main menu. 10 modes are offered, mainly consisting of time trial and race variant. Some increase damage and/or remove the respawn, some disallow abilities, etc. The interesting ones imo are Boss (Each lap is through all 5 tracks of a location, chained together with teleporters) and Score (endurance race where racing cleanly and quickly rewards you with points).Across the 4 speed classes, there are 24 ships in total, each with 7 color palettes. Ships have 1 active and 1 passive ability slot, 6 of each to choose from. The 4 locations (basically Egypt, Arctic, forest, and volcano) have 5 tracks each with no reverse layouts.12 Player Online. You can view available games (in session or not), join a random one, or host your own (publicly or privately). Only modes currently to chose from are Race and Pure Race (No abilities). There is no way for a host to limit ship tiers, so it usually ends up being class 4 only unless others are nice enough to see and match a player that chose 1-3, which may be their only option because of the progression system.A big problem for single-player but even more so online, is how ship collisions are handled. Boosting is common, so when you are inevitably hit from behind, you're often spun around backwards, completely ruining your chances of winning. Alone you can simply restart and the AI isn't as aggressive, so it's less of an issue but should still be addressed. Disabling collisions work, moving the player up or laterally sideways would work too.ProgressionAll of the content is gated behind leveling and currency earned in the career/online. 6 hours should get you the highest tier of ships and all the tracks, but you still have to earn currency to buy the ships/abilities and their upgrades. This effects online too; so you can't really hope to compete till you've unlocked most of it.PresentationSeeing this in motion, I was honestly astonished at how good this looks with how few polygons and textures are used, especially so from an indie studio. There are screen-space reflections all over the place, adding detail and complementing all the rich colors and varied light sources.The music is dynamic based on speed and is specific to each track, but it's largely rhythmic, lacking melodies/riffs that usually make electronic tracks so catchy. The engine effects are extremely mild, and really everything lacks proper presence in 3D space, but the air speed and collisions sound alright, with environmental effects in enclosed spaces / underwater.ConclusionRedout is an absolute blast. There are a few issues, it’s not quite what I’d call “content-rich”, but I am floored by the absolutely sublime game feel. They’ve crafted a handling model here that feels unique even within the anti-gravity racing genre; a wildly satisfying combination of flow and slip while also being responsive enough for you to face these challenging tracks at such high speeds. The 20(+4) tracks provide enough to do in a title so centered on mastering the mechanics, but more definitely couldn’t hurt. If they want to make that easy, I think it would be very wise for them think about a track creation tool and/or procedural generation, along with a minimal/dynamic aesthetic (Wipeout HD Zone mode) to make content generation as easy as possible.If you yearn for more Wipeout, as long as you understand that this is not trying to copy it, but rather approach many of the same principles in it's own way, you're going to love this. If you're an average racing fan but have yet to play an anti-gravity title, just expect a significant challenge and loose/slippery feel but still very responsive controls. For a beginner, you're going to have to work at it, a lot, but there's still fun to be had.			",1389,483,59,145,135,19,178

												 While I love this game, there are issues with it. Primarily with the AI.First the positives:Excellent handlingGORGEOUS graphicsAMAZING soundtrackRuns extremely smoothlyCustomizable quick races, have 8 laps against 7 opponents!Gametypes!As listed, the game has been clearly cared for during development. Excellent handling, a wide variety of gametypes in case standard racing gets a bit boring, and visually pleasing throughout a lap.Soundtrack is amazing, PLEASE GIVE US THIS SEPERATE.Now the bad:AI is too goodBoost is spammableCollision is a little wonky sometimesThe AI is way too good on this game, one mistake, even a graze on the wall can result in a 3rd becoming last place. Also this may be just me but the bots will get very aggressive on the last lap.The energy boost, while a great feature, is too spammable. It doesn't seem to matter if I have a full energy bar or a tiny portion, I get the same result.The collision needs work I think, I get varying results from a little bit of sparks to being spun out from the same kinds of collisions.Overall, yes, this is an amazing AG racer in the same vein as F Zero, and the kinks are there but can easily be fixed in my opinion. Worth the buy!			",211,14,10,24,7,0,16

												To be quite honest this is my first Review. If you were a big fan of games such of wipEout, F-Zero, and other games in the futuristic anti-gravity racing genre then I highly reccomend this game. This game takes some getting used to if you havent played a hardcore anti-gravity racing game for a while but you'll come to enjoy it. All in all the setup of this game is spectacular it the tracks are challenging and the ships even have there ups and downs. The bots ingame are a frustrating yet fun part of that challenge. In higher ranked ships the bots are a god awful annoyance. I solely like the fact that there are only two dlc's for the game and that its not p2w (pay 2 win).  The price for the game is worth it also i reccomend buying the enhanced edition over the regular game itself.			",11,1,4,6,2,0,1

												Brand new to the FZero/WipeOut genre of racers. I took a chance after I saw a streamer play Redout, and I'm loving every minute of it. The art style is delightfully simple. The frame rate seems very stable. The music is awesome and gives you a great rush when you're doing really well on a track. Some feedback for the devs:Personally, I would love a short tutorial on the mechanics. I played a bit of Mario Kart, so I was somewhat aware of strafing around turns, but with no visible feedback that my strafes were helpful, I wasn't sure (until I ran the same track a few times) that it was even doing anything. Maybe something that just runs through what each of the markings on the track mean as you go through a run, and some tips/tricks.Currently, your powerups are bound to the X button with seemingly no way to change. This forces me to take my thumb off my right stick to activate them, which is a pain with ones like the Magnetic Grip that's useful to activate going into a turn. But what's strange is, the RB isn't being used by anything. Could the powerup button be swapped to the RB?There are a few missing words and odd syntax/spellings, like the ""Do You (sic) wish to"" bit when you want to go back to the main menu. Not the end of the world by any means. Just something I noticed a couple times.All in all, I was glad I dropped the $31.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I try/buy pretty much every Wipeout clone that comes out, so this was a no-brainer. When I first played it, my impression was that the game was gorgeous, but I didn't really like the controls becaue they felt too sluggish and stiff. So I didn't play it much at for several months, got distracted with other games. Then I dove back in and realized I was only using half of the control scheme. It turns out, the right stick is *critical* to gaining full control of your ship. It's basically like a strafe. Once I got this baked into my brain, I fell in love with this game and realized it's easilly the best thing since Wipeout, if not better! Where many clones fail, Redout succeeds: track design. Not only are they pretty, but the satisfying nature in which curves are shaped and linked give them high replay value. It's a total thrill all around, worth every penny and more.Oh and one more piece of advice: Turn off the motion blur! It makes it a lot more difficult to anticipate the track ahead of you. Everything looks more crisp when it's turned off, and you won't be hitting the walls as much.			",26,2,6,0,4,0,0

												If you miss Wipeout and F-Zero buy this game. Customizable ships, contracts that award large amounts of credits and a large number of ships make this game worth the buy. The gameplay? The fast-paced races and even faster ships give this game everything it needs to be a great raver. The soundtrack has a very futuristic techno feel and blends seamlessly with three games world. I recommend this game for race fans as well as those that want to simply go fast.			",35,6,1,9,0,0,1

												If you like anti-gravity racings games like Wipeout or F-Zero, then you should buy this game.Incredible game.  Super smooth and great control.  If you want to see more, check out totalbiscuit's youtube review.  It's why I pulled the trigger and bought the game, and it hasn't disappointed me.Raced once on the monitor...then using my HTC Vive, wow...if you have a VR helmet, then you are in for such a treat.  The first race, where the track bends and twists over on itself, it was gut-wrenching...and I mean that in the BEST way possible.  Then on the second track I played, there was a straight jump, and the sensation in VR was amazing.  Simply haven't had a game that give me ""butterflies"" in my stomach like this.  Even if you don't have VR, it's a great game.This game could easily be $50 or even $60, and still be worth it.Thank you to all involved in the development of this game!!!  You guys and gals ROCK!!!win10Haswell i7GTX980runs super smooth!!! And oh...you NEED a dual analog controller.  (I use an XBOX 360 and it works great)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game doesn't have missiles, it still has non-stop fast-paced racing action in enough flavors to keep it interesting.I bought this game because I effing love WipeOut. The high-speed racing looks amazing with the ""low-poly"" stylization of the game.As the game progresses, it gets harder requiring more and more skill to handle the insane courses at high speeds. Twists and turns that need drifting, climbs and dives that require pitch control; all of it while racing against the clock and/or actually good racing AI that is challenging, not cheap.If you like AG (anti-graivty) racing games, and yearn for one on the PC that isn't emulated, hop on this train.

												If you loved WipeOut then you'll love this. The tracks are amazing and the flying feels great. It has a slightly different style of handling compared to WipeOut but you get used to it quickly if you've played AG racers before and it feels very fluid. The career progresses at a nice pace and there are many ships and powerups to purchase and upgrade. I have fully upgraded my tier 4 starting ship after 3.6 hours, so it doesn't take too long and once you have enough credits you can purchase the other ships and upgrades. Tracks unlock as you progress and are extremely fun and well made (aside from a few dodgy jumps). There are boss races where you race each track from a particular area all in one go by travelling through portals at the end of each section. The longest ones i've done take about 4 minutes per lap and I think it's a really great idea. The AI rubberbands as people have said although they do often collide with walls and end up stopping. I prefer the AI to 'cheat' and give me a good race though, it certainly makes the races intense. My main gripe with the game so far involves the collision between ships which often ends up completely spinning your ship around in the worst cases. Try to avoid contact with other ships as much as possible. Defintely the best AG racer i've played in a long time, it has so much potential and there seems to be a decent amount of content at the moment. Highly recommended to any AG racing fans!

												TLDR: Game is a very fun fast paced racing game and well worth what it costs for what you get. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys racing games.Full explanation/review:I'm 2.3 hours into this game and already am loving it. I was just searching Steam for a fun racing game that stood out to me, because I've had an itch to play one recently. This game definitely scratches that itch and furthermore excels in the fun factor. I also wanted a racing game that didn't include combat and weapons in it, and while the ships in this game can have some offensive abilities like an ""EMP"" to slow down other ships by draining their energy, it's done in a way that makes sense and adds to the game nicely.If you are considering buying this game, here's some pros and cons for me that might help you in your decision:Pros:- Fast paced racing that is exciting.- Feels great when you nail the turns and pass the other ships.- The graphics aren't exactly realistic but are visually pleasing even though most stuff is flying by really fast.- Learning the game and it's tracks is fun and gives a sense of accomplishment once you do start winning.- The music in game is pretty cool too!Cons:- It can br frustrating when other ships bump you and fishtail you.- It can also be frustrating when losing a lot and retrying the same track again and again.Although I will say the cons are probably present in any racing game, and if you are losing a lot you can go back to easier tracks or ones you know better and work towards upgrades to help you progress.Some information about other things in the game:- The user interface is nice in that you don't really have to take your eyes off your ship to see your health and energy, both of which usually heavily influence your strategy and tactics while racing.- Your ship has a health bar, energy bar and power ups you can use.- You lose health when bumping the sides of the tracks or when you don't angle your ship correctly when going through loops or down steep drops.- Energy is used when you use your turbo or some power ups (turbo is a speed boost all ships seem to have by default, and your energy regerates when not being used, making it good to time using it effectively).- You can unlock power ups after you level up your pilot a bit (level 3 i think, which is easy to get to).- There are two categories for power ups, Active and Passive and you can only have one of each equipped at a time.- Power ups can be leveled up themselves 4 times each.- You gain in game money/currency by completing races in Career mode (and potentially online mode, but I haven't tried that one yet).- The in game currency is used to purchase higher class ships with better base stats, the active and passive power ups, and to upgrade the power ups.- There seems to be a lot of tracks to choose from/to unlock, so I can't see myself getting burnt out on that for a while at least.- I used an xbox 360 controller to play this game so far, not sure how it plays with mouse and keyboard.To sum things up, if you want a fun, fast paced, pleasing to look at, feels good to progress racing game, this will go above and beyond at satisfying your needs. At first I thought it was a bit pricey (at 34.99 USD), but I couldn't be happier I added it to my library. I usually play ARPGs or RTS games but sometimes I need a good racing game to play and after not having had one to play for a while this was a site for sore eyes.I think this game is worth what it costs and is a real blast. 10/10 In my opinion.I will update the information in my review if I find I am incorrect about anything in my review or if my opinion changes, but I doubt either of those will happen.

												This is the fastest racing game i have ever played, I think. You can really feel the speed and it isnt that forgiving for mistakes but you sure can make things happen really quick. It is really fun and the tracks are most often not too long. It is easy to learn but i bet it will take time to master!I really recommend the game if you like fast racers and challanges!

												Redout is a great newage throwback to the old F-Zero style racing games. The visuals are amazing, There are 20 tracks across 4 worlds each world having its own beautiful landscape and each track having its own little features to it. The tracks get progressively more difficult as you continue through the game, and there is a steep learning curve for beginners. Recent updates have nerfed the AI in the first couple races but after that it gets pretty hard and fast. The controls feel a little loose and sloppy at fisrt but you get used to them and the game gets really fun as you learn the tracks and zip through the turns. There are 5 classes of ships each having 4 tiers of ships that race a lot faster each tier, so 20 ships total. Each ship has a few upgrades that you can purchase helping it preform better and can have the color patterns changed between 7 different paintjobs.The AI is harsh, there are a few races that I have no chance at keeping up, but other races I find very VERY easy and get gold or platinum on most of the races. There is some rubberbanding with the AI in a couple races, other races the AI is just brutally fast and you have to be 100% on point to keep the lead.Each time you get a new ship it's a unique feeling as you tear up the tracks faster and faster. When I hit the last tier it was a lot of fun going super fast, and a little dissorienting at times. You have to control the pitch of your racer as you go around loops and banks to prevent scraping your nose or tail on the ground, It's a great feature that isn't too rough to manage in the later tracks once you've ran them a few times.There are several active and passive upgrades to buy each can be powered up a few times to work better.Personally I enjoy the turbo boost with the magnetic stabilizer, it can create some really fast ""OH S%&#"" moments haha.The achievements aren't too hard to get either, which is nice. With their most recent update it fixed the one achievement not being able to be unlocked, so you can 100% this now.All in all I give this game a 9/10, only reason it's not 10/10 is because of the different AI behaviors in some maps.TL:DRGreat game, go fast AF, hit ramps, upgrade, get rekt by AI, restart races several times but have a lot of fun doing it. 9/10			",53,3,1,5,3,0,3

												NEXT GEN WIPEOUTI love this game, and here are the reasons:- The the soundtrack is a gem, sets the tone of the race and is well produced- Great variety of racing ships: about 24- Great variety of tracks, in different locations- extreeeeemly good looking game. Just check the screenshots, what you see is what you get- easy to play, difficult to master- great control scheme if using a controller- Quite hard, mostly the Pure Races. This gives it TONS of replay potential to grab a few more gold   medals for more credits- The difficulty makes it extreemly satisfing to beat the AI in career mode, also quite rewarding with many customisation options for the ships with abilities and powerups- Abilities and powerups allow you to customise your racer to you racing style - Agressive with turbo, Patient with extra grip ectBut, as with any game there are flaws:- Initially the difficulty was TOO HARD. I got thrown in the deep end and was crushed for about 20 races in a row. However practice pays off, and so does studying the race track.- Almost unplayable without a controller unless you are a god- Hardly anyone online, so no online races- some bugs with the AI at the start line, where the spin out and crash into you.- The AI's ships seem mush stronger than yours, they almost never crash and have to respawn. Also when they bump you, you are out of the race instantly as you WILL spin out, no matter how fast they are going or how hard they bump youI am really loving this game so far, played about 7 hours and not even a 1/4 through the career.

A New Dawn For AG RacingRating: 5/7 (✩✩✩✩✩) Highly RecommendedIntroduction:Redout isn't shy about stating its influences: ""F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD""—and while name-dropping is a dangerous game, I'm pleasantly surprised to say these folks can back it up. Now, I've never had the pleasure of playing POD, but I did enjoy Star Wars Podracer & even Megarace back in the day—and I think those had their share of influence over Redout as well. This game reminds me the most of F-Zero, but it does a lot to scratch my WipeOut itch as well—and that's really been my favorite AG game since the beginnig. There's a lot of love—and nostalgia—for the AG racing genre... and that means high expectations. There are some big shoes to fill.So does Redout stack up against all these legends, especially at a time when expectations are high for a competent new entry into the AG genre?Yes. Yes it does.AG Racing TL/DR Bullet Points: Excellent sense of speed Unique, technical controls Vertical axis as important as horizontal Great hovering feel Beautiful graphicsA Stand-Out AG Racer:Nostalgia for the AG genre has been boiling for a few years now. F-Zero hasn't seen an entry for over a decade, and after the close of Studio Liverpool (formerly Psygnosis—the creators of WipeOut), hope for an up-to-date ""AAA"" AG game has been teased at best. Some independent community projects have been looking promising, and the hype train has been dooting its way through Kickstarter for some time now—but nothing truly solid has really been happening.Then, out of nowhere, Redout busts in the door, lays its cards on the table, and drops the mic through the floor.Quietly in development for 3 years, this game bursts onto the scene fully-formed, and totally righteous.One of the best things about this game is that despite its roots, it has a clear identity all its own. It reminds me of F-Zero. It reminds me of WipeOut. It reminds me of Podracing. Of Megarace. But it isn't any of them, and doesn't imitate any of them completely. Redout has its own look, its own feel, and its own control scheme. It manages to be novel, unique, and stand out from the crowd—all while staying familiar and true to the AG genre. I don't think I could be more impressed. It sure isn't what I expected, but man am I pleased.Handling:Probably the very most important part of an AG game, and certainly the definitive aspect of the genre. F-Zero set the standard, and there are endless debates about which entry in the WipeOut series has the best feel and controls. It's clear that WipeOut was inspired by F-Zero, but the game had a feel all its own—and the same is true for Redout. So what makes it stand out? Verticality.The tracks in this game have loops and twists the likes of which I haven't seen since X-treme G on the N64—and Megarace on DOS PC before that. And this time they aren't just there to look cool—nailing an up or down transition is just as important as nailing a turn in Redout. If you fail to pull up on a steep incline, your pilot will start to black out, and you'll scrape the floor. If you fail to push down on a steep crest, your pilot will red out (the game's namesake); the screen will go red and it seems like you momentarily lose some speed and grip as well. Unlike most racing games, Redout will have you thinking up and down just as much as left and right.Another very unique thing about Redout is the control scheme for turning. You've got the basic turn on the left stick like any other AG racer after the early 32 bit days, but instead of opting for a left and right airbrake system, they've done something a little more interesting. Instead of modifying your turn with directional braking, the ship has strafing thrusters—controlled by the right stick (alongside pitch) by default. There is an air-brake, but it isn't directional—and in the words of Captain Falcon, ""Real men don't use brakes."" The developers claim that every single turn in the game can be taken without using the brake—once you get good enough.The best way I can describe how to use the strafe is to think of it as the second half of your steering limit. Once you've maxed out your left stick, start moving the right one. There might be a better approach, but this is what has really started make everything click for me. If you just jam both sticks at the same time, the ship kind of wobbles and slides—but using the right stick to modify the turns deliberately not only pays off, it's essential.Difficulty & Challenge:On the subject of gitting gud, Redout is a highly challenging game—I would say moreso than most games it would be compared to. At very least, the learning curve is a lot more steep. It took some time to get used to the ""strafing"" system, but once it started to click, it started to become natural. The controls really didn't start to sink in for me until after about 7 hours of play, but they never felt unfair. It was clear I just wasn't doing it right. And once I DID start to get it, the game went from pretty and fun to satisfying. I started to access that hyper-focus euphoria that draws me to these high-speed games in the first place.Powerups & Upgrades:There are tactical powerups you can use in this game, but I hesitate to call any of them ""weapons."" The closest thing to a weapon is the EMP blast, which temporarily disables opponents' energy—tied to powerups and the boost function. Other powerups include an extra-powerful boost, a repair drone, extra shields—things of that nature.You get one passive slot, and one active slot—powered by the ship's recharging energy bar, also used to power the boosters. Passive slot powerups can do things like increase your health, speed, or grip—among other things.Tracks:Redout has a satisfying array of 20 tracks across 4 environments; desert, snow, jungle, and lava. As stated above, these tracks have a lot of vertical changes. There is a wide range of difficiulty represented across the tracks. They range from wide-open, high speed tracks with slow, swooping turns to tight, complicated, and highly technical cat's cradle nightmares that require absolute focus, memorization, and accuity. Even within the same environment (say, ""desert"") there is a satisfying amount of track variation.Ships:6 distinct teams, and 4 speed classes with their own unique ships. Each ship looks and feels different, and each team suits a different play style. Each ship can be upgraded directly in 4 areas, in addition to the powerups; thrusters, magnets, shields, & energy. Each one will upgrade one or more stats such as speed and acceleration or grip. The designs are a lot of fun, which leads into:Graphics & Art Style:The art style in this game reminds me of what I imagined whenever I looked at cover art for arcade games in the late 80's. It has a fairly low-poly ""arcade"" style, but each facet glistens in the light and reflects its surroundings. It reminds me a bit of this one old arcade game... Stun Runner; except Redout looks like the idealized version of what that game was trying to be back in the day, graphically speaking. 80's / 90's low-poly arcade / Lawnmower Man type stuff. Bright colors. Shiny surfaces. Blistering speed. It's gorgeous. The graphics in this game are absolutely beautiful, and provided your system is beefy enough, the gameplay is buttery smooth. The options are reasonably scalable, and just about any modern system will play it reasonably well.Music:High-speed electronic music that reminds me a bit of later F-Zero games; totally at home in the genre.Conclusion:If you've been itching for a fun, challenging, and very fast AG game... your ship has arrived.

												I started off liking this, then the honeymoon was over, then we had a second honey moon for some good ole sexci timeThis game is seriously not for the feint hearted, too many complaining abt AI rubberbanding, the trick is how you upgrade your ship and which one you useWhile there is minor issues, the game overall is highly recommended for anyone who has played anything from Fzero to Wipeout This game is brutal, but it's worth the perserverance, just a shame so many people are just not patient enough

												Redout is a title that brings back the futuristic hover racing series that many fans had in the 90s, if you're a fan of the Wipeout and F-Zero series then you'll enjoy this hidden gem.However, the commentator/announcer voice sounds like the woman from the Hugh Mungus video and grows old very fast.I also had difficulty finding online matches, which maybe due to having to ""find"" this game rather than seeing videos and the front page of Steam's store.The track design again is reminiscent of Wipeout, but still feels fresh and unique despite sharing similarties.Bringing a ""Wipeout"" game back to PC is what a lot of people asked for, now they have it under a different name.While this game lacks weapons and may put off Wipeout fans, it does include progressions and upgrades for the ships that you pilot.tl;dr - If you're a fan of Wipeout and you've been looking for that fix on PC, then don't give this game a miss, it's well worth it!

I jump on and check from time to time, but so far I haven't seen anyone on. That's really the only negative to me, besides the fact that its just really difficult and you have to actually invest time into piloting before you're any good at it. For some that will be a good thing, but for many it's just time they would rather invest in another game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I always thought I was missing something in my life when I transitioned to PC almost a decade ago... little did I know deep inside I was waiting for a WipeOut successor and *poof* Redout appeared out of no where!The good my god is it beautiful to look at it has the pefect amount of colour balance and level design, now graphically it's not the best looking game but♥♥♥♥♥♥don't put it down for a second on that regard because they make up for it with the excellent designs. All the options are there, plenty of graphical options, audio and the typical racer game hud switches e.g km/miles etc. Now the real treat of all this game has to offer and it's straight hands down the best part and it's the god damn gameplay... the sense of speed is incredible it's so hard to explain but it's butter smooth an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ left for only your eyes to see... you just need to see it to believe it! Also another great addition is the soundtrack while it's mostly lowkey buried under the sound of amazing engines or the sound of wind and boost you will notice it and love it for what it is! There's also quite alot of floaty ship/car/boats to choose from and plenty and I mean plenty of upgrades... this is though mainly a racer and not a combat racer which is why I love it so much.Now the bad there's a couple of things I really really REALLY did not like and this is a terrible design choice in my eyes first and foremost I UNDERSTAND why people love the AI so much I do too but god damn was it a headache for the first hour of playing against it... it really doesnt help the game at all having unforgiving AI from the get go with no I REPEAT no tutorial! Theses are the little things you need in a game for a least the first 2 levels to introduce the new players... some people won't take a beating the first go and stay... some will straight up leave and like I said I think it's a bad design choice. If you don't want to change the AI at least put in a tutorial at the very least! Now one thing I didn't notice or perhaps I'm blind was an FOV slider in the settings menu didn't see one at all... this didn't help when playing on 3 screens at 5760 x 1080p while not too much of a problem it's easily fixed with a tweak because the camera by default is super zoomed in at that resolution. Not that it's a big problem but this game on the store page seems to say hey this is a VR game only some people have thought that and so did I at first perhaps put a sticky somewhere noting that you do not require a VR headset to play this game as it's not super obvious at first!So what do I think? I think it's one hell of a fun game and at this price point 100% for fans of this genre BUT I think for anyone out of the catergory wait for a price drop come back later when a few things are ironed out for new players because I know how it feels to sit through a game feeling beat and this game will beat you until you understand how it works!

This is so satisfyingly fast with tough AI to keep you on your toes. (#GitGud) This is a spolier alert for you: The controls are NOT like F-Zero and Wipeout; you MUST have analog sticks (If you have no VR) to play this game properly (i.e. XEOX Pro Analog Gamepad-USB), but hot damn I cannot express this further: Buy the damn game. I hope this has more interesting content coming soon like selecting your favourite tracks because this can be an awesome francise if treated well without having to waste it.I wonder if Nintendo's tongue got caught by the cat as if this game makes the F-Zero franchise out of date? 9/10			",9,0,1,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoyed past games in this genre like Wipeout, F-Zero, Star Wars Episode 1 Racer, Jet Moto, etc, you should just buy this game.Pros:Graphics and art style are amazing.Gameplay and UI feel very polished.Controls very well with a gamepad.No performance issues. (i7-920@4.2ghz and gtx-980)Online multi-player racing works well.Lots of races to do in singleplayer/career mode.Portals add variety to the locations resulting in more possible race layouts.Cons:No local co-op. (split-screen)AI could use some work, they tend to either be really fast or really slow and end up getting lapped.Needs one or two more locations for more track variety.Price feels a little too high.

												I've been looking to get a racing game for a few years, but have been on the fence for every single one that came to PC lately. When I saw Redout I instantly got hooked on it. The speed, and style cought me with amazement and I had to get myself the game.I have never been interested in this genre of racing where there is ""Anit-Gravity"" and every ship feels like your sliding an ice cube on glass, but... This game FEELS SO GOOD.The AI is challenging, but rewarding when you beat them! You get this sense of accomplishment when you beat the stupid AI that beat you nearly all the time! I'm allways playing on the edge of my seat. I love how this game isnt geared for you to win, Its geared for you to play.Overall this is an amazing racing game. The game doesnt teach you well on how to play it but its very simple... I play with a keyboard. Well worth the full price in its current state.P.S. The Podracer sold me in the trailer :D			",63,5,1,5,2,0,1

												Growing up with the F-Zero and Wipeout series, there have been dozens, if not hundreds of games that have tried to capture that futuristic racing gameplay and feel. None of them have hit a bull's eye on what made the F-Zero and Wipeout games classics....until now.Redout is the F-Zero/Wipeout sequel that we never got and that's high praise. Using the Unreal Engine 4, Redout is a tour-de-force of eye popping visual design, exciting gameplay, tight and responsive controls and blistering framerates. The two stick controls work to perfection in controlling your racers with the ability to hug corners or pull up or push down the front of your ship, making hills or tight turns come to heel.The track design is outstanding with a great variety of visual goodies, loops, corkscrews, huge jumps and big banking turns....basically fantastic rollercoaster type tracks. You'll even encounter sandstorms, rain and other weather elements that add to the look, feel and play of the tracks.Worth every bit of the asking price! 5/5			",288,25,11,8,21,0,13

												If you enjoyed past games in this genre like Wipeout, F-Zero, Star Wars Episode 1 Racer, Jet Moto, etc, you should just buy this game.Pros:Graphics and art style are amazing.Gameplay and UI feel very polished.Controls very well with a gamepad.No performance issues. (i7-920@4.2ghz and gtx-980)Online multi-player racing works well.Lots of races to do in singleplayer/career mode.Portals add variety to the locations resulting in more possible race layouts.Cons:No local co-op. (split-screen)AI could use some work, they tend to either be really fast or really slow and end up getting lapped.Needs one or two more locations for more track variety.Price feels a little too high.

												The controls, visuals, sounds, gameplay, feeling of speed... They nailed it. Races are long enough that the last lap feels tense but still short enough you are only slightly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if you screw it up. The cars are responsive, the graphics are smooth, and the maps feel fair. While the odds of you getting a perfect race are excessively small, and you always have room to improve, you can see what's coming ahead of you and the game is designed to encourage you to push your speeds. The menus are quick and responsive and there are no long loading screens between retries, so even if you have a short attention span it's very easy to keep saying ""one more try"". This game is damn good at being what it set out to be, so I feel safe calling this a black and white recommendation. You either want this kind of game or you don't. If you do then there's no excuse not to buy it. If you are unsure I'd recommend TotalBiscuits video on YouTube, it shows what the gameplay is like and he does a good job explaining why it works. You should know after that if it's something you'd enjoy or not.UPDATE: So, good news and bad news. The good news is this game is good enough that I just spent about 7 hours playing it the day I got it. The bad news is in that time I've already unlocked all class 4 ships, fully upgraded all of them, and easily took golds in the final career races. Now, I'm not really that good, so usually I'd say it's time to jump into multiplayer where certainly I'll need to keep improving to play with the best - but sadly the multiplayer seems to be completely dead. I've checked a few times today and never seen more than 4-5 people in games I could join. Given that it's been peak hours on a 3 day weekend, on launch week, I'm going to assume this must be because of some sort of bug limiting access to multiplayer. Hopefully that's not a long-term issue and there continues to be more content, because this is definitely a game I want to play more.			",294,44,21,23,26,1,25

												Redout is a brilliant game in the dying genre that is AG (anti-gravity) racing.  The developers truly know what makes those games special.  Nearly every aspect of this game feels like it was crafted with strong intent and purpose (nearly because power ups feel a bit tacked on).Every twist and turn on the track feels like a challenge placed on you by the designer and it feels good.  For me, most tracks in racing games feel like they may as well have been randomly generated, but with this game, it all feels meticulously crafted.  Every course in the game feels unique from the rest.  For Redout, it's obvious the devs focused more on quality than quantity.Vehicle physics feel great and are a definite high point for the game.  They did a great job maintaing a sense of high speed despite turns slowing down your vehicle, so much so that it enhances the sense of speed.  The differences between vehicles are very apparent and you will have to adjust your playstyle to each one substantially.  Vehicles have a lot of weight to them, but they feel realistic, despite AG cars not being real.  This isn't like F-Zero physics, you will be punished for making mistakes in your driving.Visually the game is beautiful.  The game makes great use of bright colors and low poly design to bring something unique to the table.  My only complaint is that motion blur is overly aggressive.  I personally love a good motion blur implementation, but it kills detail all over the screen here and I recommend turning it off.  As of the date of the review, the game also doesn't have a working resolution option, defaulting to native.  (My 4k TV for whatever reason reports 1080p as native to my computer, so this is a major annoyance for me).  For most, that shouldn't be an issue since the game also has a working resolution scale slider as UE4 games typically have.  Other than that, the game looks great and runs like a dream on a gtx 1070, holding a locked 120 fps at 1080p.The OST is a mild disappointment for me.  There are some great tracks that play, but some of it didn't really click with me, even drifiting into royalty free music territory.  There isn't anything that's flat out bad sounding to me, there just aren't many standout tracks.  The soundtrack is growing on me, but that's not the response I like to have to music.My only complaint with the games design itself is that you have to unlock things through the career mode, even for use in online play.  While I enjoy playing through the career mode, I also want to be able to hop online and have all tracks and vehicles at my disposal to play with friends.  I believe this will hurt the game in the long run if it picks up any steam.If it isn't obvious, I love this game and highly recommend it.  It's challenging and boy is it fast.  If you have ever enjoyed the AG racing genre, pick this game up.			",310,26,8,27,15,2,17

												Redout is like every great futuristic racer played at once. If you enjoyed the SNES F-Zero, you'll love the drifty handling, while the modernized controls make it so much more intuitive to play, you'll be skidding your AG machine like Dr. Stewart in no time.The powerup system reminds of Extreme G 3, and it graphically feels like some time traveller from a future past where Sega won the console war. The lovingly polygonal ships appear so beautifully gouraud at times, contrasting with the shining, brightly painted metallic circuits screaming past you faster than you can think ""golly this is pretty"". Even though you can count the individual vertices in the ships, there are some absolutely gorgous vehicle designs here. No none'a that ""aerodynamic spaceship blob with wings"" crap here. You got a BSG Viper, a podracer, a Thundercougarfalconbird, a flying spike, and a antigrav Lamborghini. Each speed class has a new model vehicle, and the vehicular designs' insanity only increases proportionally with their ground speed.If you loved gems like Aerogauge and Fatal Inertia, you'll enjoy the game mechanics and physics here, and you may find powerup system to be to your liking, allowing you to configure each ship to suit your racing style.But back to how fast this game is:You will mutter ""♥♥♥♥"" under your breath as your brain attempts to comprehend how fast this game actually is. There will be times when you just give up and bounce off the walls because your thumbs cannot keep up.This is perfectly normal. Continue playing and the machine will come to you, and the speed you desire will be yours. The tracks are gorgeous and flow very nicely, and the excellent dynamic soundtrack makes every race a pleasure. It's fun to go fast. It's fun to crash. It's fun to bump and rub with the AI (when it can keep up!)This game is excellent. ",98,3,28,3,10,1,3

												Those who've played Wipeout now have a chance to experience roughtly the same gameplay again, but on PC and in VR!Redout, from the developers of Wipeout, is a high-octane, futuristic racing game with time trials, challenges and races. Sharp turns demanding strafing, loops demanding gripping and many different vehicles and vehicle brands to unlock and choose from will provide hours of fun. It has a full list of graphical options to tinker with to get the best out of both performance and Redout's stylized visuals. This game also supports HTC Vive and Oculus VR, though it is not mandatory. Single player campaign and online multiplayer are available and it even has support for 21:9 aspect ratio. Please note, if you're going to play in VR, you're going to have to turn down most, if not all, the graphical settings. Some don't mind this, but I found it a bit disappointing seeing as how I was running it on a high-end pc. Also, this game does NOT have weapons like Wipeout did, so don't expect those either.

												Redout nails the atmosphere and fluidity needed for this type of game. I enjoyed the different types of modes offered ranging from the typical race mode to survival. There's also a good amount of different tracks to choose from as you progress in the game. Although this is preference I wish the steering mechanics felt more snappy and in-tune, they always seemed too floaty. A critique I have with Redout is being spun around from any contact made with the 9+ other racers on what typically were narrow tracks. Opponents don't suffer from this effect, only the player. Best suggestion would be to get to 1st place as soon as possible (within first 10 seconds of race).			",76,13,2,8,3,0,3

												I can't overstate how good this game is. Like some other reviewer mentioned, I 100% have no buyer's remorse with this game. I haven't spent $30+ on such a solid game in a long time.Anyways, on to the game. The gameplay is incredible. The sense of speed is phenomenal, especially when you get to the 4th tier. To give you an idea of how fast this game is, my highest reached speed is 1,547 mph, and it sure as hell felt like it. Redout will test your reflexes for sure.A lot of the negative reviews here complain that the ai is too hard. The ai is challenging, but if you're up for it, they get easier as you get aquainted. Mileage may vary, but I soon found the ai to be inadequate and too slow once I settled in with my favorite ship and upgrades after a couple hours of playtime. The track difficulty also ramps up at a sensible speed in the career mode.The visuals.Redout is highly styilized, and the visual design is extremely consistent. The color palette is beautiful and deliberate. The map design is crazy good for all 4 worlds, functionally and aesthetically. The game also runs very well on my Radeon HD 7950; the Unreal Engine 4 is clearly well optimized. Specifically, on highest settings I get 60+ frames until too many particle effects show up. But that can probably be chalked up to my old♥♥♥♥♥specs.Soundtrack is meh, it get's old after a while. I recommened turning off the ingame music and playing on some of your own. I recommend some edm; hitting 1,000 mph when the bass drops is exhilarating.Basically, buy this game if you like fun but enjoy rewarding challenges.			",78,5,5,3,7,1,2

												Overall, the game feels like a masterpiece. The controls are unique, in that it utilizes both control sticks (if you use a controller, no idea about mouse & keyboard). The movement in the game feels amazing.The speed in the game feels SO fast. Where most other racing games feel like you're stuck on a track, with a bit of leeway with jumps, this has none. Sometimes it feels like you're actually flying on a rocket powered car or something. The game is also excellently optimized. I personally have a pretty beefy computer but I've heard from friends who have a 750ti with an i5-4700 that it runs smooth 60fps at medium-high. The maps have incredible detail, and all feel like they have their own unique style and way to race. Be warned though, the game does not hold your hand at all. Instead, they shove you - into a pitfull of hungry bears.Overall it's probably the best racing game that will come out this year.			",144,22,3,16,20,1,10

Fun game that, with updates, could be great BUT....BUT the VR implementation is strange. The scale is completely off to the point that when I'm playing it feels like watching a 360 movie instead of real 3D. I can't seem to discern one depth from another. So, when in cockpit view, looking at the dashboard of my racer is the same depth as the distant scenery. It makes the whole experience feel really lame because I enjoy the gameplay, but I gon't feel like I'm ""there"" while playing. So as a 2D game it may be worth it, but not as a VR game.

												Poor man's wipeout. Graphics and art style are nice and very unique, great sense of speed, lots of tracks (although many pf them share a similar look which can be confusing). The game just isn't as refined and as challenging as any Wipeout game. The game is just too simple to complete. It let's you hit the sides of the track with no real penalty, you just bounce off like a pinball. You get gold after gold on the first try of most tracks, even later on in the game, it's not engaging. The developers seem to compensate for this later on by throwing in really tricky blind corners and jumps that twist and throw you off the track, which just seem like a gimmick to impress you on your first play of that track. I'm left feeling unsatisfied and I await Formula Fusion hoping they do a better job. Maybe get this on a good sale, not worth the full price.Edit: I plugged in my dusty ol' PS3 with Wipeout HD/Fury and it's still the better AG racer by far. Redout is blindingly fast in comparison but HD/Fury makes me feel like it needs my complete concentration to maneuver the ship, whereas Redout only needs my concentration because of the speed, not because the racing is engaging or challenging.

												I wanted to wait until I had more playtime on this game before I say anything, but I want to do it now because it's so frustratingly jarring an issue.The AI in this game is ridiculous. It takes an otherwise fantastic game and drags it into the dirt. Pure races are pure frustration, because the AI will remain ahead of you, and if you think you've caught up? They rubberband right past you. You cannot imagine how annoyed it makes me to watch as I can never catch up. If you bump into an AI, you will lose profound control over your ship, while they get away scott-free. If the AI bumps into you? Have fun being turned to face the wrong side of the track. The only events where I genuinely enjoy myself are time trial events, because I feel like I have some modicum of control for the output. If I don't make a time? Practice my turns. Tighten the opportunities for when I boost. Experiment with different powerups until I can find the one that suits the track I'm having the time trial on. Normal races are fine. At least you have tools that can afford you leverage over the AI. (Better use the Slipstream Enhancer though!!!)Pure races are a nightmare. Winning a pure race is left to blind luck. Either the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥; bumping into every wall and sending themselves careening over edges. Or the AI are virtual incarnations of Bobby Allison, and you will NEVER catch up to them, no matter how hard you try.My suggestion is to bake slipstreaming into the central mechanics of the game. Do not make it a passive powerup. Slipstreaming is absolutely REQUIRED if you would like to feel like you have a chance against AI that decide how the game goes for you. As of right now, pure races are an absolute gamble. Whenever I win a pure race, it's because I've thrown myself at it a hundred times until the stars aligned. Whenever I lose a pure race, I don't feel like I could have done anything different in order to win. I just try the race, play the exact same way I did, and hope for different results; for the most part this has worked.I understand that rubberbanding is the only way that makes racing against AI difficult, and in order to make this a fun and challenging game, you cannot compromise regarding that. What you can do, however, is to implement something that allows you to even the playing field. Baking in slipstreaming is the perfect solution; you do not have to remove rubberbanding, and it places the onus on the player to remain at the tails of the other racers should they want to secure a better position in the race. If you can fix this, I would be able to recommend this game to other people.The game is nearly great. Being a speed demon is fantastic. The ships are weighty and they all have their own identity. The tracks are fun and the environments are gorgeous. Pure races, however, are asinine and incredibly frustrating, and they take up a large amount of the events that you are required to do.

												This game is just nostalgia personified. These guys took the best pieces out of WipeOut and F-Zero and made an amazing game out of it while adding some new stuff of their own. If you're a fan of any of these futiristic-racing games, you NEED to get this. Redout includes Quickrace mode, Campaign mode and Online mode. While Quickrace doesn't support Splitcreen, the devs have promised this feature will be added in a future patch. I tried every game mode before writing this review. Career is like Wipeout's with the little difference that, from time to time, you get contracts with objectives and rewards for completing them. You can buy new ships (these are divided by classes) and buy upgrades for your ships. There are a hell of a lot of ships to choose from. Just the first class has like 10 ships (or more) and there are 4 or 5 classes. You can also equip one active power add on and one passive power add on, which you can spend money upgrading as well but you can only equip one of each type at the same time. You get money by participating in races (online and career share the same money pool); you don't have to win, but winning will earn you a big bonus. You also get experience which you use to level up your Pilot Level. Higher levels ulock higher ship classes.There are many types of events. I've only participated in Pure (no power ups allowed) Races Pure Time Trials and Normal Races with power ups enabled. As far as I can tell you only run in 4 areas. The tracks are quite varied though even if located in the same places. Online gets you in a lobby and start a (pretty smooth, in my experience) race with up to 11 other players. I played 2 online games and had no lag whatsoever. As far as the gameplay goes, this game requires some skill. You don't just accelerate, brake (the game actually encourages you and assures that you can go on without using the brakes) and steer, nope. You need to adjust your ship plus steer, otherwise you won't able to avoid damage which, if you take a lot, destroys your ship and repawns you making you lose precious time. You recover health by gathering energy which charges up automatically when you don't take damage. You can also use energy to activate the nitro and give your ship a boost up. Back to the steering, this is important: you NEED a gamepad for this game. Keyboard is supported and it has it's own control scheme, yes, but without a gamepad the game will be even more punishing to the point of becoming almost unplayable (I tried). See, one has to adjust the ship and not just steer. You have to use the right stick to control the ship's nose, not just on curves but on depressions as well. This game is rendered in Unreal Engine 4 and it is beautiful to look at, it also runs very smoothly. I cannot run it on Epic (ultra) settings, but I can run it on High-Epic settings and it runs at a steady 60fps (game supports up to 120 fps) on my GTX 970M without issues. I suspects that Epic texture require 4GB of VRAM, so that's why it won't run well on my laptop (I only have 3 GB VRAM). The soundtrack is just insanely good. There is this sense of speed that few game I have played have managed to achieve. Note that this game has VR support as well (HTC and Oculus Rift), though I honestly believe playing on VR would make anyone sick because the game is just so dynamic and feels extremely fast.The game is a blast to play, it does feel punishing but when you know what you are doing it also feels rewarding and ultimately fair. There few racing games this good on the market. Redout came out of nowhere and I wasn't prepared for it. It surprised me, mesmerized me, reminded of the old days when I played F-Zero for hours and hours. This game is absolutely astonishing. If you're a fan of high speed-futuristic racing, Redout is the best product you can get right now in 2016. Impressive job from the devs, I feel really grateful for such an amazing game that revoved so many emotions forme. Thank you very much!			",220,32,8,33,6,0,3

												Great WipeOut clone with great mechanics - The VR system lacks polish.VR: The game has some not-so-great VR camera choices, one of them being that the world and 'ship' feels like it is glued to your head - moving the whole world around you, instead of just your own point of view.This makes the VR portion of the game feel like a tacked-on stretch-goal from a kickstarter campaign.Overall recommending this game, because everything else feels and looks great about it - it is just the VR that disappoints.

												Wipeout is back, and its got a new coat of paint: RedRed makes things move faster. It's a fact!The visuals are stunning, the music is excellent. The gameplay is a bit tricky at first, but at some point the control scheme just ""clicks"" and you start burning magnet at 1500 km/h, much as it did with the original Wipeout games.I have been exclusively playing the game in VR personally. While it is not an extremely polished VR implementation, I have had minor issues such as judder during menu's and loading screens (but not in game thankfully). They have also ommitted any actual Cockpit mode, aparently due to it causing motion sickness for their beta testers. They claim to be working on perfecting the cockpit mode for motion sickness but the fact they couldnt include it on launch is a bit of a dissapointment because it would have been amazing. The views for VR that are included are ""face on the road"" or ""sitting on top of your ship"".Other than that it has been an absolute blast. Wipeout style anti-grav racers are a dying bread and in sore need of a solid title to bring them back into focus. Redout is exactly that .. only its actually faster. It's Wipeout at the speed of Extreme G.I fully recommend it.			",263,106,6,34,15,6,36

												Just a quick review giving my first impression having only a little game time.  For me it is a great game so far.  The graphics are great and run smoothly, the controls are good, the music is good - just about everything is good.  It kinda reminds me of the classic Star Wars pod racer game, but it is a lot better !  It's sort of a mix of Wipeout and other games of that type, and I am initially very impressed with it.  I'll be playing it a lot more and so far recommend it to people who like this sort of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome.I've been playing Wipeout since the PS1 days, and certainly Redout isn't a Wipeout clone (specially in the ship handling and game design choices). But oh boy, it does give you that addiction to speed and vertigo feeling.The game has some weird game design choices, such as requiring you to use turbo again and again, and the handling / physics still seem a bit weird coming from Wipeout. But all in all this is way, way, WAY better than Formula Fusion. And I'm not referring to the fact that this is a finished game, but that FF is a mess and Redout is super streamlined and focused in all its aspects.Who knows, Redout might make me forget I have that PS3 just to play Wipeout HD / Fury.

												Redout is the kind of game where you straight just go fast. All the time. Always.Then you run into a wall, blow up, and do it again because you have no idea what is going on due to the speed and are just winging it.10/10The game is actually very well made made and gives off an intense sense of speed that not many games can pull off. The crafts actually feel like how a craft of its type should, somewhat floaty.The Redout/Blackout mechanic also adds a new depth to the game which you have to constantly take note of in the form of pitching your craft up or down depending on the situation.If I could, I'd buy this for a friend in a heartbeat just so he/she could play it also.

												First off the game plays flawlessly with max settings on my computer which is something to commend nowadays for PC games (glances at No Mans Sky). The game itself is quite pretty visually and the ship designs are cool and exactly what you would expect from a futuristic racing game of this style. The gameplay is pretty fun overall so I'll just point out some things that are kind of annoying:The AI seems to rubber band worse than Mario Kart 64 (I've also beaten F-Zero GX on Very Hard so trust me on this one) and rams you in the♥♥♥♥♥♥sending you all over the track. The ships are all very wide and the tracks are comparitivley narrow. The strafing is grossly inferior to the feel of F-Zero GX and there are no techniuqes such as quick turning, shift boosting, power sliding as far as I'm aware.All the ships kind of have the same loose floaty feel to them as well and don't play significantly different to one another as say the Blue Falcon from the Black Bull or the Hyper Speeder.It's a good game; however, it's not F-Zero GX good, but I doubt even Nintendo could make that game again.

												Played a few hours of it, and my thoughts are: Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good.More or less, if youre a fan of F-Zero and games similar, then this game will do it for you. Fast paced, interesting tracks, and the soundstrack is quite possibly some of the coolest♥♥♥♥♥♥Ive heard in a while. Seriously, if the soundtrack was on sale, Id buy it. But the feel and play of this game is pretty solid, enough to keep me entertained and trying tracks over and over again just to get gold medals or figure out the courses. Its pretty satisfying. And visually its pretty damn cool to look at. Even if you spend most of the time pretty much tunnel visioning on the track, there are some cooler visuals here and there thatll still catch your eye.The upgrades and different ship types give a bit more customization for each race. There are six or so, and the game gives you one for free, but you have to purchase the others with in game currency you get from winning races and time trial events. Upgraded versions of the cars with better stats are more expensive and require a 'racer' level. But if youre really trying to get those golds, youll generate more than enough cash and level to get them when needed. As for differences between the cars, you'll probably gravitate to 2 of them from the get go due to a nice balance of stats and etc. Though (as of yet for me) Ive not yet figured out where some models would even be used due to having very extreme stats in weird places. Also, You cant win every race with just your favorite car, however. Youre going to have to swap models and mods if youre looking for gold medals, because some cars handle certain tracks and events better than others. Which is fine. Means you gotta get used to a whole group of them and get some sound judgement when needed, which adds to the depth of the game a small bit.The tracks themselves are fairly diverse in layout, with some fairly complicated ones you get pretty early on. Theyre all well designed so that you can definitely race on them and do well enough, but if youre looking for first place or gold or better medals and what not, youre going to have to practice them a bit to get the feel of them and make sure you dont collide with walls or the ground. The difficulty to me feels tuned just right, never stupid hard, but hard enough to keep you trying.I think the AI is probably the only thing Im currently a bit put off by. Dont get me wrong, I like the AI. It definitely gives a challenge (atleast for me), but man they can pull some comebacks right out of their asses at times. Still, its not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly broken, but to me it does seem they adjust a small bit to how well youre doing.Another issue is, maybe its just me but, they dont seem to give you much explaination of how certain game mechanics operate, other than in some pointers between load screen. If youre super familiar with racing games similar to this, I doubt you will have any issues figuring out controls and getting through things quickly. But for someone a bit more casual, certain things are going to seem hard to understand, like pitching up or down on ramps or loops so you maintain speeds. A bit of trial and error though will get you through most of it, however. So as long as youre paying attention, youll figure it out.One last tidbit here, before I forget. A controller is recommended. You could do this with a keyboard, but its awkward. An xbox360 controller is what Im currently using, and it works pretty damn well. So just keep that in mind.Overall, this is a pretty damn solid game. Im really impressed.			",119,18,1,17,2,0,2

												As an early fan of wipeout 2097 I can say : GREAT GAME.Fast, tough, run as smooth as my brain can handle, great gameplay, very satisfying and rewarding, amazing tracks, mezmerising soundtrack (you're naighbors are gonna hate it) and, and... yeah. Great game. Did I mention how FAST It is?What cons can I find... Humm ah! : Online, you have to go through a lot of the career mode before adventuring online... You'll need class 4 ships (the fastest ones) to compete against the others because ther is no matchmaking whatsoever... DUMB. The developpers could have simply forced us to choose a class before playing or set the class for every one according to the highest class available for the less experienced pilote? Oh and yeah, go through the career mode to make money. You won't get money online as your dad says.I'm not that huge fan of the ""Alaska"" tracks which are messy in my opinion but I guess some might find them funAnd finally : 4 envireonnment with 4 or 5 tracks, hummm... might have been more. But quality definetly primes over quantity here and I respect that choice. Oh, and there's only 5 diferent ships with 4 ""speed"" called classes. The higher the class the faster it goes. So that's technically 20 ships but only 5 different gamplays in the end. But I'm just stating the facts here because in the end, that's all you need. These are 5 fundamentaly distinct gameplays, different enough so you'll always find a ship faster or better suited for the event that may let you get that hidden reward if your worthy...That's a solid 7/10 for me. 8 or 9 if they fix the online matchmaking, 10 if future updates comes to widen the choice of Tracks/Ships or simply content.

												+ Handling/Driving model/Controls everything is great!+ Variety of ships in terms of different characteristics+ Great level and art design of maps+ Graphics (simple yet appealing)+ Difficulty of AI overall+ Only minor bugs right after the release (it can only get better)+ Ships can be customized (7 color presets, passive powerups, active powerups)+ Variety of game modes+ SoundtrackThe biggest con for me is AI. Distribution of ships and powerups across AI pilots is random, which causes very different conditions everytime I enter the same event (unless you straight up restart the event, then its the same).I would like to see handpicked ships and powerups by developers for AI or at least restricts the randomness to some degree. It would create at least some predictable conditions during event created by AI.Right now I am forced to equip certain powerups, because I dont know if AI gets some aggressive powerups and I want to avoid contacts with it anyway, because it can crash into me from behind and turn me around (it does not happen often, but its very annoying).TLDR:Right after release its very polished and fun to play game with some minor AI problems.

												This game is pretty great, but it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.Good:Sensation of speedThis game is fast, but as far as I have seen it doens't become uncontrollable. And aside from going fast it also feels fast.- ControlsI play with a Logitech F710 gamepad. I imagine it's just as good when played with an XBox 360 controller. Controls feel precise and responsive. No complaints there. I just can take a while to get used to coordinating twin stick steering or even steering with one stick and the shoulder buttons like it's done in WipeOut by default.- SoundThe sounds add to the sensation of speed as well as the intensity of the gameplay. You hear the turbine of you craft and the grinding against the walls and opponents.- FramerateGTX960 on an i5 6600K and the game runs a silky smooth 60fps with everything maxed out. More than 60fps would make no sense for me, because my screen is only 60hz. It can probably run at a much higher framerate if I disable vsync.Meh:GraphicsThe graphics aren't bad, but I don't really like the style. I personally take WipeOut HD on the PS3 and F-Zero GX on the GC as great examples of awesome looking futuristic racing games.Bad:Extremely unforgiving difficulty spikes. The AI in this game is relentless. It's not quite as relentless as the AI in F-Zero GX, but even more as in that game in Redout the AI feels simply unfair. Like when you're in first position after 3 laps on a difficult track and right before the finish, within the last second while using a boost 3 or 4 opponent just slingshot past you completely out of nowhere.

												This game is pretty great, but it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.Good:Sensation of speedThis game is fast, but as far as I have seen it doens't become uncontrollable. And aside from going fast it also feels fast.- ControlsI play with a Logitech F710 gamepad. I imagine it's just as good when played with an XBox 360 controller. Controls feel precise and responsive. No complaints there. I just can take a while to get used to coordinating twin stick steering or even steering with one stick and the shoulder buttons like it's done in WipeOut by default.- SoundThe sounds add to the sensation of speed as well as the intensity of the gameplay. You hear the turbine of you craft and the grinding against the walls and opponents.- FramerateGTX960 on an i5 6600K and the game runs a silky smooth 60fps with everything maxed out. More than 60fps would make no sense for me, because my screen is only 60hz. It can probably run at a much higher framerate if I disable vsync.Meh:GraphicsThe graphics aren't bad, but I don't really like the style. I personally take WipeOut HD on the PS3 and F-Zero GX on the GC as great examples of awesome looking futuristic racing games.Bad:Extremely unforgiving difficulty spikes. The AI in this game is relentless. It's not quite as relentless as the AI in F-Zero GX, but even more as in that game in Redout the AI feels simply unfair. Like when you're in first position after 3 laps on a difficult track and right before the finish, within the last second while using a boost 3 or 4 opponent just slingshot past you completely out of nowhere. I don't mind a challenge, but that is rediculous to say the least. Unfortunately this can lead to extreme frustration. It sometimes makes you feel that you as a player aren't allowed to be able to win a certain race.Bottom line:I like this game. A lot.

												I love this game, i've been waiting for such a game for a long time, in fact, since I discovered wipeout hd and have played it a bit. Unfortunatley I don't have a PS3 myself, but I have played wipeout pulse on the ppsspp after that A LOT. Well, Redout is a bit different than wipeout. First, there are no airbrakes, in Redout you can tilt your ship left, right, up and down. Left and right is clear, basically the same as the airbrakes, they are only workig a bit different. But why up and down? Because there are Black- and Redouts, positive and negative g-forces which are taking appereance in (inverted) loopings. To avoid them you have to tilt up and down. The third and most important difference is the speed - even the lowest speed class is way faster than the phantom speedclass in wipeout, and this is just AMAZING! Whatch some videos of it and you will see what I mean. One more thing to mention: there are no weapon pickups in redout. In exchange you only get active and passive powerups which you can select and buy before the race. The passive ones are Powerups which are active all the time, such as higher speed or better grip. The active ones are partly some kind of weapons. But only EMPs or some other stuff. I would recommend this game to everyone who had played wipeout or f-zero, or just likes racing games. I personally love it.			",25,1,3,4,4,0,9

												TL;DR: Any fan of racing should give this game a look without a doubt, Check trailers, gameplay and reviews (I recommend TotalBiscuits little review of it) and anyone who is a fan of F-Zero or Wipeout... Well this is basically it's combined spiritial successor. GO GET IMLong review:Now, I grew up with WipEout, Specifically WipEout Fusion and some other racers (CTR, Super Bombad Racer, Burnout and so on). I love racing games but not the one people think of when you say 'racing game', not the ♥♥♥♥ing F1 racers or the NASCAR racers. You know, Simulation Racers but I adore the G-Racing genre and this is the game I have been waiting for... For well, a long♥♥♥♥♥time.After I heard Psygnosis (Developers of Wipeout) closed down I felt like this was the end of the genre. G-Racing was dead and nothing was gonna bring it back. I remembered back to the day I got my PS3 and the first game I ever got for it. WipEout HD Fury. I ♥♥♥♥ing loved that game. I played it so much I think some of my online friends thought I died. I loved the story and the racing and power ups and I especially loved the Teams. (Team Icaras for life!)A year or so later I heard of a game being kickstarted called Formula Fusion and it got me pretty hyped. It looked like what I wanted so I backed it and... well it is still being developed. Although it looks promising it was not enough to fill my desire.Then I noticed this game and I fell in love. The only things about it that I feel I miss is weapons but even then I realize that this is not WipEout and it never will be. It is RedOut and despite the similar names it has a focus on speed and skill more than skill, speed and destruction.I looked all over the net for info about this game for a week before I got it on a late Sunday and I have not felt this happy with a racing game since WipEout HD Fury from when I was a teen. This game is balls to the walls hard and it will kick you in the nuts with its speed, learning curve and design (Dear god the design. This game looks ♥♥♥♥ing amazing) but you want more. I got my♥♥♥♥♥beat the first race but I refused to give up and just kept playing.The Monday after I picked the game up at around the middle of the day and let the controller down after midnight with a newly unlocked Class IV ship and a tired smile on my face. I love this game and while some small problems exist (Don't alt tab this game unless you are confident in your PC setup) I can't recommend this game enough.If only there was a Deathmatch mode with some weapons and splitscreen support I would give it a 10/10 but for now I guess a 9/10 with a glowing recommendation will do. I have already bought this game for a friend and I think once the Winter Sale arrives I will throw this game at pretty much every friend I know.Some moments in this game will have you either flinching in pain or amazed in presentation (First Volcano map I am looking at you) and it is a blast to play.A few beginner tips: Get the first ship on the screen. ESA. It is amazing as a beginner ship and buying new ships is not that expensive. I never had any issues with money in this game.Active and Passive powerups are good but invest in upgrading instead and switch ships to find one that fits you or the challenge you are facing. I recommend getting at least 1 ship with high grip as it is really really useful.Take any contract you get and if it looks hard remember that nearly all of them (like 90% of the ones I have gotten so far) can be cheesed. Find out how on your own ;3			",124,11,3,19,13,3,30

												The world needs more arcade racers, and the world ESPECIALLY needs more that are this highly-polished, well-designed, and outright satisfying. The tracks are engaging, the environments are beautiful, the events are varied, and I'm having so much fun just holding on for dear life and barely keeping myself on the track.I've yet to try the multiplayer, but based on everything else I expect it to work flawlessly. I can say that if you're looking for a high-octane racer then absolutely pick this one up. If you're only sort of into racing games, I'd say give it a shot. If you're not into racing at all, then probably pass as I could see this game getting pretty unforgiving in later stages.			",367,82,24,48,37,4,62

												Worth every cent!Let me start off about the sense of speed in this game holy crap! I tried running this at lower graphics settings to see if it was some mumbo jumbo via post processing effects but now it somehow has an even better sense of speed with motion blur turned down or off! Not going to lie i didn't have much in mind for expectation for a game that Claims to be a tribute to f-zero  but it nailed it!pros: Amazing sense of speed!         Great visuals even at lower quality it still looks nice!         Controls are super tight!         Music is amazing love the cairo themes! Cons: Ship Control learning curve is tough at first but once you figure it out it almost comes second nature.         Skill tree for power ups are a bit odd (felt myself wondering if i had things equipped or not)Conclusion: Get this game you won't regret it!   ",166,6,15,11,4,0,6

												This AG Racer is laser focused on 2 things:1) A brutal sense of speed: Never since the last dozen or so races in Need for Speed: Underground 2 has a game reminded me that I can, in fact, stop breathing and blinking for 2 and a half minutes without even noticing it.2) Giving you complete control over your ship: The ships hover without ground traction (so consider that or say hello to the wall), slopes will make you lose speed (so tip the tip of your ship downwards as you go down) and inside loops will grind the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your ship against the track (so tip your ship up). It's so nerve wrecking it should earn this game the tag of Survival Horror.So pretty much is like driving (a Ferrari at full speed without brakes) on (very hard) drugs. I imagine.

												The description doesn't lie. Redout manages to be a near perfect blend between Wipeout and F-Zero, with some clear inspirations and homages to other, classic futuristic racers of yore. There's even a pod racer in there...So how does it fare? In short, amazingly. If that's all you wanted to hear, you can stop reading this review now. If you're into specifics, then read on:Redout captures the same sense of speed that got me hooked on F-Zero and Burnout, integrates futuristic looking environments into the intricate circuits just like I remember from Wipeout, and controls just as sharply as you could ask, with a slightly innovative use of the right stick (with the default control scheme anyway) to strafe and pitch. Controls that may feel familiar to you if you're a long time fan of the futuristic hovercraft style of racing game, even in their new execution. The method of strafing to the inside of turns to regain traction, or the outside to extend a drift, felt close enough to how I used to play F-Zero GX that I'm sure some of my old skill carried over, although the added importance of pitching up and down in steep slopes, to avoid blackouts and redouts and preserve momentum, introduced enough additional finesse to keep me challenged from the get go.There's also a small set of powerups that you can unlock and choose from between races. These are unintrusive enough to not get in the way of a ""pure"" racer like myself, preferring the weaponless likes of F-Zero over more combat oriented racers, but perhaps still offering enough to keep you interested if you really did like messing people over in Wipeout. None of them are downright weapons, though; Your most offensive tools consist of an arc that drains a nearby opponent's boost meter and adds to your own, and an area EMP blast that freezes your opponents' energy pool for a second to give you an advantage when clustered up.As for content, I just unlocked the class IV events in the career, so I'm most of the way through the game's single player mode, but even having gone through oodles of different races with a surprising amount of variation in game modes (without any that feel unnecessarily gimmicky, fortunately), I'm still tempted to go back and clean up those silver and bronze medals the game taunts me with whenever I open the event list. Even though the career is divided into classes, limiting which class of ship you can use, you're free to hop back and forth between old and new events or even win the same one over and over if you really feel like you need to grind for cash to get that one upgrade you're missing, or buy another higher class ship before you take on the new division. I can't speak for the multiplayer as I've not yet tried it, and I don't put as much importance on that as I do single player content, anyway. What I've gotten so far has been more than enough to justify the price tag.Redout scores high marks on aesthetics, as well. The lush and conceptually quite detailed environments and ships carry a charmingly hard-edged, polygon shaded look that gives the game an almost retro feel, but the crisp, high-detail tracks and special effects, fueled by Unreal Engine 4, remind you that you're very much playing a modern game on a modern machine. My GTX 980 has no problem keeping a steady 60+ fps on max settings no matter how intense the action gets, probably in large part thanks to the deliberately low-fi models. The music fares well, too. Though I have yet to come across any single song that really sticks with me, there's no doubt the smooth trance soundtrack helps carry the experience in the same way as the simple-but-interesting visual design, keeping the pace going without getting in the way. I'd like to give the soundtrack a listen, if there were any way to do so outside of the game.All in all... God, where'd this game come from? Why is it so good? I'd ask why it even took so long for this to finally happen, after so many near misses over the years since the GameCube went out of style, but it's become increasingly apparent that it simply takes a heck of a lot of skill, talent and passion to make a game play as well as this. So good on the developers for pulling it off. If there's ever talk of an expansion or a sequel, I'm already on board! Especially if there'd be more of the lovely little tricks this game pulls, like how some of the tracks have teleporters that allow them to connect back up with themselves without tediously looping back around, letting you get to the exciting part quicker, over and over again. Or how the ""boss"" variation of the tracks take all of the circuits from any given environment and link them ALL together, nigh-seamlessly, via those teleporters, to create a gigantic, never-repeating endurance run through the entire area all in one race...I find it hard to stop typing about Redout, which I suppose makes the bottom line: I recommend this to anyone who likes ridiculous speeds. If you've ever enjoyed Wipeout, F-Zero, that Star Wars pod racing thing, Extreme G or anything like that, you probably owe it to yourself to give Redout a shot.			",278,44,5,15,17,1,22

												This Game is a blast. This might be my favorite racing game at the moment and i played around 1000 hours of Trackmania. I higly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys extremly fast paced racing games. Positives: - The feeling of Speed is absolutly perfect. I have never played a faster yet controllable racer in my life- The Graphics are amazing. Not over the top yet colorfull and flashy. - The Controll over your Racer is incredible. ( You do need a controller though, without it this might suck since you need both analog sticks.) At first you will crash into every wall but when you realize that you absolutly have to utilize the second controll stick you dont need the brake at all.Negatives:- No lokal COOP. Its sad that this simple feature is missing. There is online play, though with a small playerbase- The AI is godlike in the early levels and way too easy in the later levels. This might be the biggest downside of the game. The first levels are simply hardly beatable in a satisfiing manner and when you get further into the game the AI seems to fall appart a little. They just cant take the curves as well as a human beeing could. This needs adressing especially since the multiplayerbase is so small.In conclusion this is the fastest racing game i have ever played and remindet me a lot about StarWars Episode I Racer. I cannot compare it to Wipeout since i have never played it. If you like fast racing games with a high skill ceiling this is the game for you. 8/10 ",49,4,1,6,2,0,4

												It's high time we got a real Wipeout-equivalent game for PC. There have been some wanna-bes but Redout is the real deal. Highspeed racing, beautiful and huge tracks, great sense of speed while playing, online multiplayer and a lot of ships to pick from!Beware though, it's much faster and therefore much more difficult than any Wipeout you have played!

												The description doesn't lie. Redout manages to be a near perfect blend between Wipeout and F-Zero, with some clear inspirations and homages to other, classic futuristic racers of yore. There's even a pod racer in there...So how does it fare? In short, amazingly. If that's all you wanted to hear, you can stop reading this review now. If you're into specifics, then read on:Redout captures the same sense of speed that got me hooked on F-Zero and Burnout, integrates futuristic looking environments into the intricate circuits just like I remember from Wipeout, and controls just as sharply as you could ask, with a slightly innovative use of the right stick (with the default control scheme anyway) to strafe and pitch. Controls that may feel familiar to you if you're a long time fan of the futuristic hovercraft style of racing game, even in their new execution. The method of strafing to the inside of turns to regain traction, or the outside to extend a drift, felt close enough to how I used to play F-Zero GX that I'm sure some of my old skill carried over, although the added importance of pitching up and down in steep slopes, to avoid blackouts and redouts and preserve momentum, introduced enough additional finesse to keep me challenged from the get go.There's also a small set of powerups that you can unlock and choose from between races. These are unintrusive enough to not get in the way of a ""pure"" racer like myself, preferring the weaponless likes of F-Zero over more combat oriented racers, but perhaps still offering enough to keep you interested if you really did like messing people over in Wipeout. None of them are downright weapons, though; Your most offensive tools consist of an arc that drains a nearby opponent's boost meter and adds to your own, and an area EMP blast that freezes your opponents' energy pool for a second to give you an advantage when clustered up.As for content, I just unlocked the class IV events in the career, so I'm most of the way through the game's single player mode, but even having gone through oodles of different races with a surprising amount of variation in game modes (without any that feel unnecessarily gimmicky, fortunately), I'm still tempted to go back and clean up those silver and bronze medals the game taunts me with whenever I open the event list. Even though the career is divided into classes, limiting which class of ship you can use, you're free to hop back and forth between old and new events or even win the same one over and over if you really feel like you need to grind for cash to get that one upgrade you're missing, or buy another higher class ship before you take on the new division. I can't speak for the multiplayer as I've not yet tried it, and I don't put as much importance on that as I do single player content, anyway. What I've gotten so far has been more than enough to justify the price tag.Redout scores high marks on aesthetics, as well. The lush and conceptually quite detailed environments and ships carry a charmingly hard-edged, polygon shaded look that gives the game an almost retro feel, but the crisp, high-detail tracks and special effects, fueled by Unreal Engine 4, remind you that you're very much playing a modern game on a modern machine. My GTX 980 has no problem keeping a steady 60+ fps on max settings no matter how intense the action gets, probably in large part thanks to the deliberately low-fi models. The music fares well, too. Though I have yet to come across any single song that really sticks with me, there's no doubt the smooth trance soundtrack helps carry the experience in the same way as the simple-but-interesting visual design, keeping the pace going without getting in the way. I'd like to give the soundtrack a listen, if there were any way to do so outside of the game.All in all... God, where'd this game come from? Why is it so good? I'd ask why it even took so long for this to finally happen, after so many near misses over the years since the GameCube went out of style, but it's become increasingly apparent that it simply takes a heck of a lot of skill, talent and passion to make a game play as well as this. So good on the developers for pulling it off. If there's ever talk of an expansion or a sequel, I'm already on board! Especially if there'd be more of the lovely little tricks this game pulls, like how some of the tracks have teleporters that allow them to connect back up with themselves without tediously looping back around, letting you get to the exciting part quicker, over and over again. Or how the ""boss"" variation of the tracks take all of the circuits from any given environment and link them ALL together, nigh-seamlessly, via those teleporters, to create a gigantic, never-repeating endurance run through the entire area all in one race...I find it hard to stop typing about Redout, which I suppose makes the bottom line: I recommend this to anyone who likes ridiculous speeds. If you've ever enjoyed Wipeout, F-Zero, that Star Wars pod racing thing, Extreme G or anything like that, you probably owe it to yourself to give Redout a shot.			",278,44,5,15,17,1,22

												TL:DR: this game rly gud, get itInitially i refunded this game due to the annoying spinout mechanic, however after realising that:1. there is indeed strafe and pitch in the game2. having SLI on for some reason disabled half my controller inputsI picked it back up with full contollsThis is eerily close to wipeout 2097s handling, but outstrips it in the racing focus and track design instead of being combat focusedThe sound track doesnt let it down, volcano I sound track is easily my favourite but the others arnt far behindup until this point, Tech De Ra had been my favourite track out of any AG racing title ever since its addition in wipeout pulse, but its 9 year reign is now at an end and has been replaced with the redout campaigns final track of its final tournament, the Ultimate SRRL Endurance volcano boss track, just over 4 unrelenting minutes (per lap) of fast twists, sharp undulating turns, blinding loops, drops, obscured hazards and jumps, taking you from the surface deep into the depths of the volcano, to the ocean it neighbours and back again was the most fun i've had in an AG game for a long long timeI never write reviews for games, but this game is worth it, along with every penny it costs			",75,2,4,13,9,0,18

												I haven't played this game much (in class II of IV at the moment), but I can already recommend it. It's not too difficult to pick up, but quite hard to master. Pros:- Graphics- Music- Sound- Design- Control layout- Steep learning curve- Easy to pick upCons:- Steep learning curve- Deceitfully easy in the beginning- Hard to figure out what's a good ship to begin with- Not much in the sense of a tutorialEdit:To those feeling this review wasn't helpful, please let me know why and I see if I can update it : )			",272,83,13,35,43,2,66

												PROs+ Probably the best racing AG experience existing+ Superlative sense of speed+ Easy to learn, hard to master, super precise, responsive and innovative control system+ Unmatchable aestetics: great stylized low poly style mixed with state of the art shading techniques+ Great ships design and variety: enough choice to satisfy every player type+ Smart, fresh and unrivaled track design (20 different tracks ATM)+ Multiplayer works like a charm!+ Hardcore experience. Not forgiving AI: this game is not for n00bs or crybabiesCONs- Can't f*****g stop playing- Some minor bugs (devs said will be fixed soon)SUMMARY:This was made by a pretty much not known INDIE studio. Do you realize that???I played all the famous historical AG racing games, and so much time passed since the last time a I felt so much adrenaline racing. This game put you in the ""ZONE"" and keeps you there so well you will even forget to drink and sleep.This is what I was looking for: REDOUT is not only a game, but a COMPLETE EXPERIENCE.11/10 can't recommend enough.PS: Even my friends that are not inside racing games are loving it!

												Decided to write a bit better review for this amazing game.Redout basically is that game you never heard of that blows you away the first time you play it. The worlds (cleverly made in a flat shaded polygon style) look fantastic and the complex (but rewarding) ship handling make this game a masterpiece.The tracks are well designed and are very challenging (those lava tracks o.o), while the actual handling of the ships is unlike anything I've ever experienced (even in other AG racing games such as Wipeout or F-Zero). At first the handling model will feel wrong and hard to drive, but once you start understandingt how it works, it really unlocks the game and takes it to a whole new level... and the sense of speed is literally unreal; I've never played a game that makes me feel like I'm going this FAST.In fact, it literally is so fast that I can't even take my eyes off the road to look at my HP or boost bar at the fastest tier (4).Optimization seems great, the game runs super smooth at a solid 60fps on my rig without any dips whatsoever. All up an amazing game and totally worth trying.10/10			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

												A very good tribute to the original AG-racing games.  Personally however I cannot recommend it at it's normal price (£26.99) or even on a 40% deal like current (£16.19) unless you are extremely into the AR genre.  Unlike the original Wipeout, Redout does not really care about collisions with the track walls but does care about SPEED.  Regardless of what walls you hit, you'll find the fastest way to complete courses and beat opponents is simply to hold acceleration at all times and crash into certain corners because letting go of the throttle for even a second to avoid walls will cut your speed dramatically without really improving your cornering.  This, alongside the fact that when an opponent hits you your craft will spinout without affecting them (ensuring your loss) and potentially lacking replayability are why I have refunded Redout.  It's a very very good looking game, it's just not for me.  (And none of my friends would ever buy it at this price to play it with me :( )			",129,27,2,14,16,3,26

												I've cleared Master Mode in F-Zero GX but I could never get the hang of Wipeout's floaty physics and momentum-killing wall grinds. If you're like me, be warned: I crashed hopelessly into a difficulty wall after less than an hour, which isn't super satisfying at this asking price. It's certainly more polished than the other games like it, but if asked how to modernize this genre, I wouldn't have said ""more realistic physics."" This is a hover racing game where your floating ship can even grind against the ground, with most turns at speed demanding flawless fiddling of both triggers and every joystick axis. It's pretty, it sounds good and it runs great, but I guess I'm too old and my spare time's too precious to find this kind of frustration fun anymore.			",283,118,11,13,14,1,12

												I wanted to like this game, I did. I got this game from a promotion when upgrading my gpu, It was fun at first then I started incountering problems.PROS:+Nice Music+Good GraphicsCONS:-Overly difficult (It's like you can't even win because you'll be in first place then the CPUs get a random boost of speed and come out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowwhere. Now your in last place.)-Hard to gain speed (There is a turbo boost but that can only get you so far because of OP Opponents)-Turning is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (I barely press the turn key and I hit a wall I try to turn back and I hit another wall, I looked for senistivity options, couldn't find one.)-Health is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (Like I said you can't stop turning in to walls so you end up dying a million times.)I've played difficult games but this beyond my experience.Along my way I found several bugsBug Number 1: The game launched in the background and I couldn't open it. I had to end it in the task manager and reopen it which was annoyingBug Number 2: I was holding down the accerlerate button and my car stoped moving and I fell behind, I had to pause the game and unpause it to move againBug Number 3: Every time that I close the game now it gives me a error about some type of runtime and it takes forever to sync the files in steam.I would reccomend this game if you like gamebreaking bugs, OP computer players, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controlls.

												I've only spent 80 minutes on this game but what a joy they've been! My first playstation game was Wipeout 2097 and this is without a doubt the closest thing you'll get to it, just with modern day graphics. From what I can remember Redout seems faster so if you're a casual racer I can understand some people may find this infuriating. There is no difficulty setting and the speed is already pumped up to beyond normal levels. That said in 80 minutes I've unlocked the 2nd of the 4 classes. Initial impressions are great. Yes it's from an Indie developer and lacks the production values of AAA games i.e. menus, voice overs etc, but the core element is perfect; the racing, handling and speed.Now what remains to be seen is if the career mode can hold interest beyond the first hours of play. Multiplayer yet to be triedUpdate to follow after a few more hours of play!Update #1Since I was havng such a good time with the game I felt I was rushing it, so I deleted the save and restarted. The second race which i got a gold medal on after one attempt I now can't even get past position 5. Even playing a near perfect run opponents wiz past you which implies there is a serious issue with IA, and this is after i've mastered the track. This is where things get frustrating as it takes the skill out of the game. One reviewer said the AI was fixed in the first four races. More updates to come. It's also worth noting that despite my lap time improving every race the AI was always able to keep ahead no matter what which implies it's designed to do that.Update #2 after 6 hoursAfter upgrading the ship, which I might add is rather dull, the above track problem was resolved and the race was won. The upgrading consists of 5 upgrades and that's it, no tiers, just 5 basic upgrades which you'll probably do when buying the ship. So the upgrade system is a little pointless as it stands. The powerup upgrades do have tiers so its odd the devs didnt do something similar with the ship upgrades.Multiplayer is fun and nice to be up against real players. What's odd though is that there is no class sorting, so it can put class I players against class IV players so this definately needs some balancing. I just played a match where the class I players abandoned the race as they were against higher classes. Devs please sort this.All this game really needs is a tournament mode - although there are some scattered throughout the career mode up would be great to have a few dedicated tournaments for each class or even for ships. All in all the best time i've had with an indie racer, and for that matter a AAA racer. Top notch!!			",306,77,7,24,1,0,5

												I am loving this game the whole feel of it is great, Its so rapid, runs super smooth, And the controls are really nice, having to use the second analouge stick to pitch the nose up and down and strafe left and right really adds to the way the game feels and help's to give you more of a feeling that you are one with your racer, I love the controls, but I do have a couple of  small problems, When I start the game up the loading screen is in 1080p but once its loaded the game is running at 720p(even with the resolution at 100%), Also the Tunes don't seem to have a lot of weight, by that I mean could do with a bit more depth of bass, Great game haven't had this much fun with a racer for ages and my gripes are only little and do not detract from such a great game!Fav game of 2016 so far!

												First off: 8.5/10PROS:The sense of speed is amazing. I never felt like i was going super fast in wipeout but this game really gives that sense of speed. The controls are very solid and intuative. I never felt like i lost control of my vehicle. When you perfectly go around a corner, the game just gives you such a wonderful sense of control. I really cant explain how it feels but it never felt so good nailing a corner before. Menus are well done and cool looking. There are 4 classes of ships with each higher class being much better than the previous. This game is quite literally the best anti-gravity racing game i have ever played.CONS:The AI is pretty extreme on that rubber banding. Sometimes you will be in front and then all of a sudden you are last place. Then sometimes you will be in last place and almost instantly find yourself in first for a few seconds. The AI could be improved but its not game breaking by any means.Performance isnt the greatest. I have a 680m and with most settings on normal im able to get a solid 30fps. Thats not bad by any means but i want that 60fps. Turning down all the settings just makes the game look bad and doesnt really affect much.			",58,13,8,5,3,0,20

												As a fan of the F-Zero series and currently without access to an appropriate console this game is a godsend to satisfy my desire for a high-octane futuristic racer. Visually this game holds its own with a wonderful use of themed colour palettes, decent music and excellent gameplay. I highly recommend this game!I only have two minor qualms:* The framerate dips occasionally and isn't as consistent as I would like it to be, even after lowering the graphics settings.* I would love to be able to have custom constroller bindings. However, I do appreciate the three layouts provided (I use a 360 gamepad and prefer the ""Classic"" layout).Considering the price point, I give this game a 9.5/10. It doesn't get much better than this, in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great fun but so intense I had to keep my sessions short. Worth every penny for me though I can see myself coming back to this plenty in the future.(The ""survival"" races are terrible though.

												So far, this game is absolutely wonderful. The controls are tight and the graphics are breathtaking.

I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt since it's the first day of release, they're a small company and I'm asking for too much when I say I want 2160@60 on epic settings.Anyway, buy it.

												I've honestly never had a wide variety of racing games when I was little but the one title I did have, and loved, was Hot Wheels. If you ever played versions such as World Race or Stunt Track Challenge (really the only versions I owned), this is guarenteed to bring back a lot of good memories. The asthetics of each trask are outstanding, the races are exilerating, the action is pact, and it is quite a challenging game. Not easy by any means (at least if you're not use to these types of mechanics), but that certainly does not take away from the many hours of fun you'll have. I only just got it a little while ago but I have not found a single dull moment in this game. ProsDetailed, vibrant graphics.Nice looking ships (that only get cooler with each class  that you upgrade through leveling).Active/Passive upgrades (weapons, boosters, shields, etc.)Non-unique individual ship upgradesInterchangable controller options.Career AND online modes (random matching and custom lobby).5 stunning, unique tracks per area (4).Quick race feature for if you want to just practice one of the 10 types of races on any track of your choosing. Cons  (mostly minor)Few ships (6) to choose from.Few powerups (12total; 6 active, 6 passive) to choose from.Can only upgrade each ship in 4 areas once.No leaderboard (currently).Controls are not fully customizable; there are currently only 3 presets for controller and 1 preset for keyboard.Again, just to reiterate, these cons are very minor. This game is still a very enjoyable experience overall.I hope this guide helped. If I missed anything in the pros or cons (or made a mistake), please tell me (with civility) in the comments.

												First and foremost, I have never played F-Zero or Wipeout. But nevertheless, when I heard an ultra fast faced racing game came out on Steam, I had to get my hands on it. This game is everything it is hyped up to be and more, But first I will go over some strengths this game has, and some areas the devs could improve on to make the game better in my opinion.Strengths:-INCREDIBLY Fast paced. You get in you Class I car the first level and you already feel incredibly fast in it. Now please know there are 4 classes of cars, and the higher the class number the faster they go. And I mean a LOT faster. -Difficulty. The difficulty in the game is surprisingly well impolemented. Instead of having the AI racing around on perfect maneuvers, the difficulty is set by the actual track. In class III and IV, your goal is to basically not die as you zoom around the track at lightning speeds. The Diffuculty mechanic is implemented in the courses themselves, rather than the AI. This makes the skill cap incredibly high and also the game incredibly fun to master.-Vehicle selection encorporates many different driving styles and all are fairly balanced, to name a few: quick but fragile. tanky but slow, mid speed with a lot of energy (for turbo). It just is very well designed in my opinion-This game is just ♥♥♥♥ing fun you have to trust me the sheer feeling of sliding around a turn when your spedometer next to your car says 1200 km/h and you boost out of it screaming by obstacles and cars you've just lapped is phenomenal.-Also this game is gorgeous, the aesthetic and geometric patterns really enhace the persepective of speed in this game.. I love it.Areas of Improvement:-The peer to peer online system is kind of janky, but it's understandable considering not many people play online at the moment (hopefully this changes) and it's not economically feasible to set up and maintain servers.-Thats literally it thats the only thing I can truly find wrong with this game.Good Job 34BigThings srl, I love your game. I will be playing this for many more hours out of the sheer adrenaline I get from racing around these tracks. Please make more tracks, cars, and content for this game I would love it so much.

												A masterful example of racing in its' purest and rawest form.  It walks a very fine line between challengingly enjoyable and frustratingly sadistic.  The minimal graphics are beautifully presented and suit the setting of a post-apocalyptic Earth.  Ship and track design are where this game truly shines, with each team being unique, and each track offering its' own unique challenges to overcome.  Control system does offer something a little different to the AG racing genre, and mastery of this will only increase your enjoyment of this game.  But be warned, with a very steep learning curve, this is definitely not a racing game for beginners.  This is not a game you dabble in like a dilettante, you either to commit to the premise that Redout puts forth, or you don't.  You are either in or out.Strap yourself in then....you're going for a ride.Before I continue, I want to make one point abundantly clear.  This game IS NOT for beginners.  If this is your first time playing an anti-grav racing title, believe me when I say, you WILL need to try a different game first.  In this case, I recommend any of the WipEout games or F-Zero, on an appropriate emulator or console, if you can track one down.  The reason I suggest this is that these titles, while having similar, albeit basic physics, will prepare you to play this game, because of their shallower learning curves.  If you consider yourself a ""gamer"" because you play games on your mobile phone, or bought a console because gaming is ""cool"", you need to go back to playing Candy Crush or Farmville.  The rest of this review DOES NOT concern you.Redout is an AG racing game for hardened veterans, or racers looking for a good challenge.  Posers and dilettantes need not apply.  In fact this game does not even want you if you are anything representing a ""fake"" gamer.  For me this game embraces the hardcore, hardened gaming veteran.  It welcomes you with open arms, before bending you over and spanking you repeatedly with the paddle, and somehow making you want more.  For me, Redout wants the hardcore gaming community onboard.  Which is a refreshing change, given that so many titles these days are dumbed down to appeal to a broader fanbase and drive sales.To channel Jeremy Clarkson, this game is like trying to shave your testicles with a chainsaw while an axe-wielding psychopath is trying to get through the bathroom door with an axe.  And yet for some crazy reason, I don't care!Getting to the point, mastery of this of this game is not measured in metres, but in microns.  While the basics of the controls of this game are similar to most racing games (accelerator, brakes, and steering), mastery of this game will comes from mastering strafing and pitch of your ship.  While it's a small innovation; doing away with left and right airbrakes like in WipEout and Formula Fusion, and replacing it with left and right strafing, and pitching up and down, on the right stick of your controller; it is inspired.  Essentially strafe and pitch are for me minor adjustments, with more standard controls handling the big stuff.  Balance and master these things and you are well on your way to consistenly winning gold medals and winning races.Put simply you will need to master the controls, master your ship, master the tracks, and even master yourself to get the most out of this game.  If you can, you are in for the ride of your life.  Even if you, like me, can't quite do those things (I'm a little too old for a racer such as this), but have the patience and perseverence, and willingness to respect this game for exactly what it is you will be rewarded with a racing experience that is sublime, almost transcendent.Has racing nirvana been achieved?  I think it has.But, you have to accept this game, and the premise is offers, as a complete experience.  It is all or nothing.  You cannot focus on one or two little flaws, which this game does have, and still expect to enjoy this game. Being picky will interfere with your experience while playing Redout.  For example, the graphics are for me beautifully presented, but they are minimal.  The soundtrack fits almost flawlessly into the background, but could do with some variety.  The controls are deceptively straight-foward, but are hard to master completely.  Each team has a unique take on how you will tackle each track, but you could argue that they have to each be raced a certain way, and might not be flexible enough for some.  The tracks themselves are designed in such a way that will challenge you every step of the way, but will be way too hard for some.This game is greater than the sum of it's parts and always will be, and for me THAT IS THE POINT!

												Great future/AG racer that fans of the genre owe it to themselves to try out while waiting for the final version of Formula Fusion to release; Beautiful tracks, a nice robust Career mode that lets you purchase and upgrade ships by earning gold, something I find many future racers lack. Really nice.My only complaint (and a small one) is the ships, in comparison to the detailed tracks look a bit low-poly and boring, I know they were going to a 'stylistic' look for the ships but I found they don't mesh well with the beautiful tracks, and compared to the fantastic looking ships of say Fast Racing NEO or Formula Fusion I think they could have looked a bit better. Minor complaint that many people who appreciate the overall style won't even care about.Check it out, great to see so many nice future/AG racing games coming out after the great wipEout drought.

												Pretty damn good. For the amount of stuff being rendered, and the speed (oh god, the speed), it runs very smoothly. I've been noticing that many new games start lagging on my setup when I try to stream music or videos while playing. No such issues with Redout. If you do have issues with framerat, the setting are highly adjustable and you can disable portal graphics, which apparently cause lag for a lot of people.My only complaint is that not enough people are playing this. When I saw the trailers I thought everyone would be at least as excited as I was. But I've yet to find anyone doing multiplayer. Quite a shame.			",132,6,2,12,4,0,11

Redout - A fast racing game that is actually fastIn a racing game, going fast is the highlight of your play experience. Whether it's drifting though a corner at break neck speed or taking that boost that sends you flying, the rush in a racing game comes from scenery flashing past and the track twisting before you almost before you can react. Some games capitalize on this more than others.Games like Star Wars Episode 1: Pod Racer or F-Zero capitalize on this sense of speed. However, speed isn't just what's on the speedometer. When tracks blow past the player almost before you've even recognized them, and decisions that are made in the split second you're given are not enough for a perfect time, you need to see ahead of the track, learn the track, to truly master it. Going at full speed results in smacking into the walls, slowing down results in the opponents catching up to you, leaving the player no choice but to balance on the knife's edge.Redout takes a very similar approach and the speed is apparent in many aspects of the design of the game. The racers blaze through the tracks at supersonic speeds and taking a corner at high speeds means you have to drift harder than Takumi Fujiwara. Boosting either via boost pads or pressing the boost button (or the BIGGER boost button, if you're into that) blows up your field of view to the point where you almost feel like the camera can't keep up with the racer. All of these little bits of design and polish add together to create a virtually unparalleled experience of speed. Seriously, no other racing game has gotten it as right as this one right here.Graphics and PerformanceThe artstyle is a colorful simplistic low-poly affair. It's nothing remarkable, but this isn't really the point either. After all, it all becomes a colorful blur at the speed you're blazing through it anyways. The simplistic graphics help with distinguishing things like curve indicating arrows or just the track itself against the background, and all in all, it doesn't look too shabby with the generous application of Unreal shaders and effects. Most importantly however, it runs at a butter smooth 60fps on my i7/GTX980 with only minor frame loss while travelling through dense particle effects.Sound and MusicThe sounds convey what is going on fairly accurately and generally sound OK, although some of the audio cues for certain special abilities could be a little more distinct. What really sets this game apart here however is the fantastic soundtrack and dynamic music system. The soundtrack is a blend of intense high BPM techno and guitar riffs, almost bordering on eurobeat at times. It's such a throwback to old school racing game music, and fits so well with the feel of the game, that i'm inclined to say it's the single best game soundtrack of the year.SingleplayerThe singleplayer modes are nothing to really write home about. There's the career mode, where you'll buy and upgrade your racers in between races and maybe take on bonuses for sticking with certain brands or testing out upgrades, and there's the quick races where you can customize the event however you want. The different events are varied and actually pretty interesting; there's generic race events (time trial, classic races, endurance races), elimination (last place contender every lap is eliminated), ""boss"" tracks (all tracks in a region tied together with teleporters for a ridiculously long track), survival (EMP mines sprinkled all over the track, go through X amount of checkpoints before time's up), arena (no respawns), instagib (super fragile racers), and tournament variations of the above. There's no real storytelling or narrative, just you, the track and the opponents.MultiplayerHere is unfortunately where my review takes a turn. There is a fully-featured match making system and custom lobby system for online play, but, and this is in my opinion a huge minus, there is no split screen mode. For a game which is such a fantastic throw back to futuristic high speed racing games of the past couple decades, it's such a shame that there's no way to play local multiplayer. The developers have expressed intents to implement it eventually, and considering that they are aiming for a console port it's extremely likely that they will actually carry through with implementing a split screen mode. I'm just sad that it wasn't in the release version from the get go.As for the online multiplayer, it's extremely rare to find a game and equally as rare to have somebody join yours, so it's not something i'd bank my purchase on.ConclusionThis game iss fffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaast			",39,5,2,0,10,0,9

												I got this game because I wanted a good quality racer to play in VR that wasn't as much racing sim as say project cars is, but overall I think I had more fun just playing it normally on a TV/PC that in VR. It's good in VR and all but it didn't give me the immersive feeling I was looking for. That said, I really enjoyed this game a lot (played many more hours than recorded, but have been offline) and if you're looking for a good current wipeout style game then by all means pick this up - especially if it's on sale!Anyway, I generally don't agree with the comments made in the negative reviews - especially the other vehicles being too hard - it still has NOTHING on the frustration Mario Kart causes when getting blue shelled 2 seconds before the finish line then coming 7th... but yeah to be fair it would be nice if the other vehicles didn't peel away so fast for no apparent reason sometimes or offer more in the way of AI difficulty settings...Only thing I'm not a huge fan of is having to angle your ship to not hit the ground on hills etc but that's just me. Still, even that's not too bad when you get used to it.All in all very pretty game, great use of UE4's colour toning throughout, well worth the money!			",217,62,10,9,18,5,17

												Certified fast. Beyond Mach Speed fast.Bloody difficult as any hover racing game would be, time attack runs are going to look so good. Speaking of, there is no time attack mode or worldwide leaderboard, maybe they'll add that in a future update?25/12/2016 Update: The game now has a Global Leaderboard on all events. They also added EVEN MORE TRACKS, and EVEN MORE COLOUR SCHEME OPTIONS, and LIVERY OPTIONS. The colours and liveries are SCM items so you can buy your rare paintjobs like you might knives in CS:GO.My only wish is for there to be a track that allows you to push speeds to the absolute limits!

												Redout is a really fast paced racing game, that offers a long campaign (even though that it´s simply a chain of different races you need to complete - without much of a narrative), onine matches, and an abdundance of different race types.You probably got all that through the other reviews so I´ll cut this short regarding the general stuff.1. CONTROLS: ""Is it too hard? Is it simply bad design?""The controls in this game take some time getting used to, even if you already played games like WipeOut before.As someone who played mostly Trackmania or Distance (or even Mario Kart :D ), it was a challenge to get used to this style of racing. If I had to compare it, I´d say it´s more like playing Grand Tourismo with a wheel, instead of the other aforementioned games.Bottom line though, once you get used to the game, it loses most of the frustrations you first experience.BUT let me say this: This ain´t like NFS with crap mechanics like the rubberband function. IF YOU FALL BEHIND, IT´S SUPER HARD TO COME BACK.2. GRAPHICS Yea, pretty nice.3. MUSICNot my jam, but I can dig it.4. ConclusionIf you like fast paced racing games, you don´t dislike challenges, and you are a nostalgic WipeOut (or even Star Wars Hover Car Race!) fan - you´ll get your fun out of Redout.Only sad part is, that there aren´t too many players playing online.

												Really solid all around. Fast paced, high octane, suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I thought the AI was a little easy at times but overall privided a good challenge. In all honesty, once you get a good handle of the controls it's pretty easy to get in the top three positions of every race.But like I said, Great game, fast paced, if you liked Wipe Out or F-Zero this is a great game to pick up.

												This game to me is the definitive AG racing game. The strafing mechanic of the ship means that the game is easy to pick up and play but also leaves a very high skill cealing. The ship handling alone would be enough to make this a must have for any AG racing fan, throw in beautiful graphics and a stella soundtrack and you have yourself an absolutely amazing game.I can't reccomend this enough. If you are a fan of the genre you will feel right at home but if you're new you will also have an absolute blast!			",188,29,5,12,20,1,28

												The best thing I can say about this game is that it made me want to play Wipeout. I feel like I'm a good way through the game and understand how it ramps up. It's a pretty good antigrav/arcade racer (if a bit clunky) but it serves as a reminder that there will never be another Wipeout.Good:- Visually gorgeous, simplistic style with great effects- Decent music- Good controls/sense of speed- Interesting track designs- Motion looks amazing at 144hz*- With enough speed you can take a jump and fly up to the edge of the skybox- Boss mode is something I've never seen before and is legitimately interesting.Like many racing games, Redout re-uses locations for different tracks but in boss mode, you switch between tracks in the same area multiple times DURING the race, leading to very long laps and also meaning you need to be familiar with them beforehand as the track switching throws you into different parts of each track in a strange order.Poor:- Redout/Greyout mechanic does nothing for actual gameplayWhen hitting sharp declines or inclines, you're meant to pitch down or up respectively so you don't see a colour tint effect for half a second. The only time this matters is on extreme inclines so you don't scrape your ship against the ground.- No rebindable keys, not even an alternate layoutI would have liked to make the arrow keys turn and A and D strafe, seeing as that's how most games in existence use WASD.- Music tracks are assigned to specific race tracks, which repeat constantly. (1 song per track)Some of the songs also have distracting beeping noises that sound like a low health alarm or something.- Some of the worst A.I. I've seen in a racing game.On tracks full of tight corners they get left in the dust and frequently hit walls but if you pass them in a gentle/straight area (even with a fully upgraded vehicle) regardless of your speed they immediately rocket in front and 'magnetise' to a distance about 5 car lengths ahead, and will continue doing that until another series of tight corners.- Uneven difficulty curve.The first 10 or so events I didn't see another driver outside of the start of the race, then suddenly the aforementioned rubber banding kicked in. Track designs also do not flow well, especially in Alaska.- *Graphical settings do not save.Every time I launch the game I need to raise the max fps, turn off motion blur and turn off v-sync.- COULDN'T TOP SKYNYRDEverything in Redout that tries to emulate the feel of Wipeout, from the announcer to some of the menus to the ship designs, just makes me want to play Wipeout instead. Which I did, and after playing more Wipeout Pure on PPSSPP it's GAME OF THE CENTURY			",489,73,21,17,17,1,39

												It's like WipEout HD with better graphics, an interesting artstyle, some nice new concepts, some nice new power-ups, a mix-up of the norm and, sadly, worse music. I got immediately hooked and I played it for two hours straight right off the bat after it was done downloading.From the start it has a nice little selection of vehicles, the campaign works as it should, it has a different system than expected when it comes to power-ups; They're not as much weapons as they are tools. Sure, some drain enemy vehicles' energy, but other's may improve your grip. You don't get these power-ups on an in-stage basis, you buy and upgrade them between missions, and stick with them or switch them out whenever you wish between missions. There aren't only active power-ups, there are also passive ones that will just work constantly. These can also be upgraded and switched about.One thing I also noticed was the speeds at which you go. Billions of blue blistering bubbling barnacles, the speed is high. It can be a little bit -too fast-, but with a bit of breaking and strafing, you'll be on the right way fast. I should also mention that -USING A CONTROLLER IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED-.Presentation-wise, this game is very, very pretty. I start feeling slight motion sickness when there's a lot of motion blur, so I was happy to see that turning down the quality of the motion blur seems to lessen the blur itself. The game might be hard to run for older computers as the post-processing is advanced and a lot of the effects and particles are pretty heavy. The artstyle of the game has a slight polygonal twist to it, which I like.The only negative thing about the presentation, I would say, is the music. The music on certain levels even had vocals, something that I personally believe the game could do without. I'd hope the team takes some inspiration from WipEout and adds some new/switches out some tracks. Sure the tracks are upbeat, but they lack some of the harmonic badassery that the forementioned game's soundtrack posesses.All in all, I'd say that this game is a must play for anyone who is into WipEout, veterans and noobs of racing games alike, anyone who wants some true speed and a true challenge. I'd just suggest that the team would change certain things, like adding a grid for campaign level selection and adding new music tracks or switching out some old ones. I'll gladly buy any future DLC for this title, and I'd give it, all in all...[AN 8,5/10]Meaning it could do with some improvement, but it's a fantastic product from the get-go. ",294,37,4,23,16,4,8

												Spectacular AG Racer from the Italian guys at 34BigThings, probably among the fastest racing games I've ever played. The intense feeling of speed is backed up by a good enough soundtrack, visually stunning tracks and responsive handling. The game features many interesting game modes, online play and a lot of different cars and power ups to customize your car. More content is coming along the way to make this game even better than it currently is. It needs a bit of balancing, but it's doing great so far.The best take on the genre in years. If you love this kind of games, it's definitely worth 30 bucks and many hours of your time!			",216,24,5,23,9,2,9

												Fast, varied, visually appealing and with just enough challenge to draw you in, RedOut is a Future Racing game I can point to and say ""This. This is something you should aim for.""Gold is achievable without too much struggle, but you can still♥♥♥♥♥♥up enough to lose a race. Tracks are *mostly* clear, and the controls are simple, which is good, because the speed is pretty blinding. It has tactical elements in terms of powerups, different handling styles, and even the use of the turbo (Spend a little bit now to recover from a sharp turn or collision, or wait for it to fully recharge for the hardest boost on a straight?) , and the Contracts (Where the game asks you to win, or just play with a certain craft and its loadout for a race or two, in exchange for rewards) encourages learning how each craft works, incentivising experimenting with the game.The sound is clearly differentiated, the music is varied, and the craft evolve while remaining visually clear due to their relatively low polycount and different designs.I have very little bad to say about this game, and it's mostly to do with the tubes of Abruzzo, which are one of the few unclear track features. Well worth the time and money.			",378,153,20,79,50,4,91

												Just some thoughts on this one:- slick with good production value- VERY FAST racing where everything literally goes by you in a blur- play against AI or Online- has a simple career mode (no story, just levels that get unlocked)- has various quick race / practice modes all can be played against the AI- very colorful- getting good is all about 2 things: memorizing the tracks & improving your twitch skills- might not have lasting appeal for older more mature players as I can see myself getting bored of this within another 10-15 hours tops- purchased on sale but due to its simplistic & restrictive nature I personally feel it's somewhat over-priced for what it is and how much play time I'll actually end up getting out of it.I recommend it, but ONLY on a good sale and likely best suited for younger players.*Played with Xbox360 Controller			",51,2,11,1,9,0,1

												NOTE: This review is for the 1.1.0 version and that I haven't played in VR mode.  Gamepad STRONGLY recommended.  This game doesn't offer keybinding in its current state.Redout was one of the better games I've played released in 2016.  However, if you're looking for a pure spiritual successor to either F-Zero or Wipeout, you might be disappointed.  The game does feel like a hybrid of both franchises but there are some nuances to the core gameplay.  First is the strafing mechanic that's controlled with the right analog stick (on default controls).  This is crucial for making the sharper turns in the game and most players won't understand right away.  The trick is to strafe in the opposite direction of your turn.  It has a bit of a learning curve but it eventually becomes second nature once you get the feel of the timing down.   Second is the use of active and passive powerups, where you can equip one of each at a time.  This is where some Wipeout fans might be disappointed because these aren't like the weapons found in that game.  Instead these are more like buffs and debuffs, the latter being exclusively for active powerups that allow you to for instance, drain boost energy from nearby rivals or temporarily disable their powerups.  I prefer these over the weapons in Wipeout because they allow the races to be less dependent on luck and more on skill.  Lastly, there's the mechanics in health and boost.  Your ship's health regenerates over time but the catch is you have to avoid hitting walls for some time for it kick in.  Since higher classes have the walls do more damage, the game rewards you for learning the track.  The boost gauge also refills gradually but the speed depends on the stats of the ship.  The strength of the boost and the energy used depends on how long the button is held.  Active powerups also use the boost gauge, some require it to be full to use.The game uses a low-poly art style that's very inspired, especially in the tracks.  The artbook DLC explains in greater detail on how it was made.  This also benefits gameplay because less polygons allow better perfomance.  Where the Unreal 4 Engine is truly utilized is in the fantastic lighting that's used appropriately in every location.Normally I don't listen to trance type music but the soundtrack is well done.  My only issue is that there needs to be more tracks, preferably at least 3 for each of the five locations.  The game sort-of makes up for this by having a dynamic effect where the order of the beats change depending on how well you're driving but I don't think it's quite enough.  This issue is most noticable in the Europa tracks since there's only one song that plays.  Granted it's the longest song, but you'll be hearing the first couple beats every time you start racing.  At the very least, I'd like to see an option for a custom soundtrack.  There's a lengthy career mode with various event types that will keep you busy for a while.  That being said, aside from that, you'll probably be spending most of your time in quick race against the AI because you'll rarely see people playing online and there's currently no local multiplayer, which may or may not come in a future update.  Speaking of the AI, it could use some tweaking.  I noticed that even on the higher classes, the AI ships will consistantly fall off course in certain parts of some tracks.  Another thing that could use tweaking is the crash physics.  Sometimes when someone bumps into you, your ship will spin 180 degrees, making it difficult to ge back to 1st.  It'd be better if crashing into other ships just shoved them in whatever direction.  My biggest issue with the game is how it handles unlockable ship colors and liveries.  Basically, you'll get a random drop (sometimes duplicates) once a day after racing for around an hour.  Since there's dozens of these, this process takes a ludicrous amount of time.  I've put in dozens of hours since this feature was added and I'm nowhere close to unlocking everything.  While these can be traded and sold in the marketplace, they are not worth what they are going for.  It would've been much better if these were just sold in the in-game shop in career mode.  I have >$3 million that can't be used for anything since I've already purchased everything in the shop.Overall, despite leaning a bit negative later in the review, I do enjoy the game.  It's not as polished as F-Zero GX but for an indie game, this is a solid effort.  The sense and thrill of speed is second to none on PC.  While $35 is a bit pricy, it is worth it if you enjoy fast futuristic racing games.  If you still aren't sure, there's always the demo or wait for a price drop.  I give Redout a B.

												I like Redout a bit, and by that I mean I love it. I love the ships, I love the tracks, I love the environments, I love the more polygonal look, I love the way it handles. I love how the tracks twist, coil, and weave through each other like a roller coaster on steroids. I love the evolution of each racing team from the slowest vehicles to the fastest. I'm just itching to tell people about it and show them.For a more in-depth look at the game and its mechanics and stuff, I recommend checking out 'The SRRL Compendium' guide on the community hub.If you like to go fast, if you'd like to try a different set of controls, Redout is perfect. I think what pulls people in but what also pushes people away about Redout is the speed and controls. From the very first event you're accelerated faster than the speeds at Formula 1. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get into it, it's relativley smooth sailing... Sailing nose-first into the mouth of a volcano at mach 1. The default option controls a bit more like a plane than a car, appropriate since these vehicles are more like jets than boring ol' wheeled cars.The soundtrack is pretty hype, and matches the pacing of the game quite well. There's really only one song I'm not too fond of, but it's not bothersome. I love how different parts of the song will play at different moments, even out of order, and timed perfectly building up climaxes throughout an event.There's some pretty good cosmetic customization at the moment, 9 different color schemes and 3 different patterns for your ship, and even more that you can unlock each day. No microtransactions, just play some and see what you get.However, I'm sitting on almost $3 million in-game currency after getting all the upgrades for everything a while ago, perhaps they could make cosmetic items unlockable by using in-game currency?There seems to be some bugs and crashes that occur like settings not saving, but the only one I've experienced is a delay in the countdown audio.This is a game where I force myself to sit up nice and straight with the screen farther away than usual. I get so giddy sending my ship careening down a straightaway, off a ramp, and into the air at 900mph. It's quickly becoming one of my most played games on Steam, and the most fun I've had playing a game in a while.			",39,7,3,2,6,1,5

												Despite being someone who loves racing games more than FPS titles, I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this game until I got my own copy. The summary itself says what it's influences are, and by playing through the whole game, I can easily say that it's very accurate.It's fast, no doubt about that. Absolutely difficult, but with a forgiving learning curve. If you know how to play the game right, you actually can find some compromises that suit your racing stile. But overall, it's absolutely satisfying, very fun, and I very much recommend this to anyone looking for their high speed F-zero-esque fix.			",78,5,7,5,7,0,2

												Reviewing about playing it in VR on the HTC Vive:Really awesome. So much fun, great VR experience without only relying on VR specials but beeing an actual game! Only Doom3 Mod could do that so far for me.It was just what I was looking for.  I wanted to play some seated VR game, in a cockpit or similar, so mostly racing games or space ships would apply. So after trying Project Cars I was disappointed, looked bad and had bad performance (GTX 1060 6GB @ 2012MHZ GPU/9100MHz VRam, i7-2600, 16GB Ram). This game has it's own graphics style, futuristic and flashy, so no high details are needed. Therefore it runs quite well with the right settings, so 95% of the time smooth, only a little stutter (45FPS with reprojection, but I turend it off for this game, better have ~80FPS than 45FPS imo) when a lot of objects are on the screen at once.So you drive this really crazy fast pod-racer on crazy routes that feature loopings, screws, tubes, jumps, boosts etc. Now imagine that in VR. You turn your head to the ceiling to see whats coming in the looping. Free way, so you push the super boost to go even faster. Oh, and class II ships are even faster. So are class III ships. Did I mention class IV ships? New all time speed record. New personal best lap time. New furthest jump. It's all pretty cool and motivating. Btw I don't get any motion sickness, but I never faced that in any game so far. I ♥♥♥♥ing love the feeling of speed in this game. I play without ship or cockpit, just the tack and HUD, but in many reviews I saw people complaining about missing external view of the ship. This is very much possible, maybe implemented in some patch.You can tune your ship or buy new ships according to the game mode, which I think adds positivly to the game.Some Cons, to stay fair:Some game modes are less interesting than others (Boss-Mode so far on of the coolest).Loosing in a row can be annyoing (but hey, it's a racing game).Enemy driver ♥♥♥♥ing you from behind sometimes gives a Mario Kart feeling. But the AI is very fair, no cheats or rubber band as far as I noticed.Still a lot of GPU-Power necessary.TL/DR:Great game, great in VR, SPEEEEEEEEED, get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just to get this out of the way, I've always been an F-Zero guy. When my best friend introduced me to F-Zero X as a kid who loved Nintendo games, I got hooked. The super fast gameplay, all of the hovering machines and the race tracks that twisted and turned through the air grasped my attention and imagination like nothing else. Since the last iteration in the series, F-Zero GX was released in 2004, many have tried to emulate or to recreate the feeling of pure speed and adrenaline that those games embodied, and many have come close, but few have perfected it.So, how does this fare then? Well, it certainly gets speed right. Right from the get go, the first thing I noticed is that this game doesn't take speed lightly. Right from the get-go in the lowest tier of the game's different machine speeds, the speed is INSANE. Machines fly around so fast that you get tunnel vision, with no extra added in visual effects (aside from a bit of motion blur). Little posts on the road fly by at speeds that make other ""fast"" racing games look slow at times. This is great and all and really adds to the experience, along with an awesome visual look and soundtrack. Graphics are super clean and look great even just sitting at the start line. But, this game is different than F-Zero, and as such, the opinions some have of it may be different. While F-Zero is much more about an arcadey, tight, fast paced racer with slight combat mechanics added in, this offers a slightly more realistic alternative. Don't get me wrong; this game is still very much arcadey. Flying hover craft machines flying through an Alaskan tundra-turned race track isn't what I call hyper realism, but the momentum of a hovering machine going at break-neck speeds was clearly taken into consideration. Machines will slide and continue with the momentum you'd actually expect, which is where the more realistic aspect I mentioned earlier come into play. This dynamic creates a gameplay more centered around maneuvering your hover craft through the courses than it is knocking other machines off the track. So, because of this added in realism, the game becomes a lot more about mastery; requiring you to carefully learn the dynamics of your ship and the courses you race on, finding the best ways to carry it through in the quickest time. It's really quite fun and the presentation really carries it to awesome heights. The feeling of shooting off of a jump in some of the Alaskan levels at speeds exceeding the thousands while an awesome climax in the music plays gives a feeling of extreme and just pure awesome that I haven't felt in a racing game in years. With all of that said, it's with a big yes that I recommend this to you. While it is on the expensive side, I can see fans of arcadey racers and fast paced games alike having a blast with this, despite a not-so thriving online community. If this goes on sale, certainly do not hesitate to give this a try, as it really has some great content. F-Zero may not have another iteration for some time, but titles like these certainly do the genre justice. ",84,13,13,2,5,0,3

												Unreal sense of speed. Never played Wipeout but loved F-Zero GX. This game scratches that itch perfectly.

												One of the Best racing games I've ever played. Redout has an intuitive but nuanced control layout. Dual stick turning, with both normal and strafing, is a genus move. Takes no time to learn and it will be a while till I have it masted. Also the art style is something right out of the Redline anime handbook. It genuily help you feel like you are going too fast for your own good. It gave me a genuine shot of adrenaline going top speed through those turns.If you have ever enjoyed anything from F-zero to Diddy Kong Racing, Forza to any other car sim. Get this game.

												Spectacular AG Racer from the Italian guys at 34BigThings, probably among the fastest racing games I've ever played. The intense feeling of speed is backed up by a good enough soundtrack, visually stunning tracks and responsive handling. The game features many interesting game modes, online play and a lot of different cars and power ups to customize your car. More content is coming along the way to make this game even better than it currently is. It needs a bit of balancing, but it's doing great so far.The best take on the genre in years. If you love this kind of games, it's definitely worth 30 bucks and many hours of your time!			",216,24,5,23,9,2,9

												The fastest 3.2 hours I've lost in a while. The machine that looks like a Pod Racer is the meta machine. Makes the AI eat your exhaust. Grab the magnet upgrade to take this racer onto tighter tracks. Played in VR, no nausea, no loss of balance, no eye strain, with no breaks. Note: there is no positional tracking once you are in a race.With 980TI SLI (AMD rig), this game runs butter smooth in max settings. Except for one parculiar hiccup when a big vortex gateway comes on screen, a few of the races have a couple of these gateways. Causes the fps to drop considerably until you pass the gateway (about 2 seconds on screen or less).			",136,20,4,16,5,1,14

												I can't stress enough how much I've been enjoying this game lately. As someone who grew up playing F-Zero GX on the gamecube, this game feels extremely satisfying when you manage to nail that ""going fast"" moment. The tracks are beautiful and fun to race on, and the VR support works like a charm. I can see people getting a bit motion sick from it, but it hasn't affected me at all, and is a lot of fun to play in VR. If you like anti-grav racers like WipEout or F-Zero, then definitely give this game a shot, I don't think it will let you down.			",145,35,1,20,18,0,33

Product received for free
OVERVIEWRedout is a high-speed futuristic track racing game in the same vein as Wipeout 2097 and other similar classics.I used to be a Wipeout junkie. It was one of my favourite games on my old PSX and I played it to death. It got me into FSOL and The Prodigy. When ""We Have Explosive"" or ""Firestarter"" came on, I knew I was going to win. And I was pretty good at it, too. So when I was given a chance to play and review Redout, I jumped at it.There's a story behind Redout's world, but it's not really important. It's so not important, in fact, that the game doesn't bother presenting it to you. There's not even an introduction to the game. If you're interested, you can read the Steam page instead.GraphicsThe first thing you'll notice in Redout is the pretty slick interface. It looks nice, it's well animated, and it's functional. Once you've used it to start your first race, the next thing you'll notice about the graphics is that they move rather fast -- fast enough that you don't have much time to pay attention to whether they're very good or not, at least at first.I've been playing some games lately with much more impressive graphics -- the dust clouds and storms in Mad Max, for example, put Redout's desert dust to shame -- but with the speed at which Redout moves, everything passes quickly anyway, and it mostly looks reasonably nice. If you pay attention, though, you'll notice some large polygons and sharp edges sometimes, although in many cases this seems to be a style thing.The ships are the highlight of the game and they look pretty cool: not very aerodynamic, with all of those sharp edges, but cool. But enough of those big triangles, really!Some of the visual effects are a bit overdone and distracting, such as the sparks from grinding on the track surface and the whole screen colour changes during 'redouts' and blackouts, but the game does have a good graphical coherence to it.Redout gives you a ton of graphics detail settings, too. I'm playing on a GTX1070 graphics card with everything set to 'epic' and it churns along at a nice rate.SoundMusic is good. It's not Wipeout 2097 good, but it's good enough. There don't seem to be that many music tracks, though; either that or I'm just unlucky enough to hear the same couple over and over again.Sound effects are okay, but although the graphics give a good sense of speed, the sounds do very little to help it along. They could benefit from a bit more punch.Voiceovers are text to speech. They sound okay, but wonky enough in places that it seemed a bit second rate. There's a nice homage to Wipeout in there: ""contender eliminated."" Yeah!GameplayIf you've ever played Wipeout or any of Redout's other influences then you'll be pretty familiar with this. You buy a hovership with starting cash, compete in track-based races like rollercoasters in order to earn more cash, and gradually move up the ladder, buying better classes of ship until you're the best of the best. Races are fast and at least in the first class, you don't need to remember which button is the brake.There's a nice range of ships to choose from, in four classes. Only the slowest class is unlocked to start with, but you'll soon enough be racing the second class ships as well. Unfortunately I found this progression a bit disappointing; the game is fast with Class 1, and just doesn't feel much faster with Class 2.As well as ships, cash can also buy you powerups -- one passive and one active at any one time -- and upgrades for these powerups. These should add another dimension to play, but after buying the fully upgraded Advanced Propeller (supposed to increase acceleration and top speed) and the EMP, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with them. Racing the fastest ship with the passive powerup that's supposed to make it even faster, some of my supposedly much slower competitors seem able to out accelerate me at the start of the race, or overtake me on the straights, even while using my afterburner. And more often than not the EMP does nothing, even when firing it off right next to an opponent. I suspect some of Redout's challenge actually comes from computer opponents that don't quite follow the rules.Some text is provided as background for the powerups, but this is written quite badly. It's a shame; I feel the developers would have been better off leaving this out entirely rather than making the poor attempt that seems to have been made here.Redout supports VR devices, which I don't have, and game controllers, which I do. I played exclusively with my XBox 360 controller. Controls were mostly good, although I found the right stick (for pitch and jink/strafe) a bit tricky at first. Activating your active powerup (default X button) is a bit of a pain, too. But I found the controls worked well enough after some practice.There are two basic single player game modes: career (where the core of the game lies) and quick race, which gives you a choice of 10 types of race in which to participate. There are the usual time attack, normal race, and elimination race types, too.Redout also features multiplayer, but I've been unable to find anyone playing, so I can't comment on how well this works. With the speed of the game I'd hope the net code is robust and fast. In what seems to be becoming a fashion in indie games lately, there are no server stats available, so you don't know whether anyone else is even playing anywhere, and there's also no way to change your racer name: it uses your Steam profile.The career mode also offers seemingly random -- and sometimes broken -- contracts. These give you a chance to make more money or even gain a powerup by winning the next race with a specific craft or a specific powerup. They're a nice idea, but they don't always work. For example, the first contract I received told me to use a powerup in the next race, which turned out to be a 'pure' race (no powerups allowed). I won the race and then changed my ship for the next one, and the game failed to recognise that I'd won, told me that I'd failed the contract, and then gave me the prize powerup anyway.If you're having trouble with a race (you shouldn't in Class 1, at least; they're very easy) you can always replay previous races to try to earn enough cash for a powerup or upgrade to help, but races you've won previously pay out much less when you replay them, so be prepared to grind races a bit if you have to make some cash.Overall I've found Redout to be a fun racing game, but it's not the next Wipeout, much as it might try. Where Wipeout's powerups and weapons added a sense of excitement to the game, Redout's sort of fizzle out and don't add much to the experience. But it does try hard, and the many game modes and added multiplayer (if you can find anyone to play with) should keep you occupied for quite some time, even though with only four environments and a few tracks in each, you'll end up seeing the same tracks a lot!PROS AND CONSPros:+ Fast moving + Good music+ Controls are fun, if a bit slippery+ Lots of race types to keep you interested+ Achievements and Trading CardsCons:- Buggy: I had a CTD with no warning when loading the first tournament race and contracts don't work properly sometimes- Not enough track variation; only four environments and not many tracks in each- Powerups are a bit naff- In-game text needs some proof reading- No one playing multiplayer- AAA priceCONCLUSIONRedout is a good, fast racing game that's not quite deserving of its high price. Recommended, but only if you can pick it up at a significant discount.70/100Note: I received this game for free for review purposes.

												I usually don't into racing games, but if you like some of the more retro hover racers, you'll likely be hooked onto this game. Not standing at full retail price (currently $34.99), it's more than worthy of a grab especially if you're tired of games and half games in the [Current Year]. The VR half of the game is a little odd on my rig with a 6700k i7 processor with a GTX1070, the game tends to break solid framerates-- which is odd since the game runs butter smooth at 1080 60fps in 'epic' settings without breaking a sweat. Perhaps I'll look into a solution and update this with it in the future, but it's a solid twin stick hover racer.[Edit: On the vive, the settings need to be set to low to keep a consistent framerate]			",182,22,3,35,12,0,19

												Great racing game. Awesome sense of speed, great tracks, beatiful graphics, kick♥♥♥♥♥tunes and tough but fair AI opponents. There's plenty of ships to accomodate different driving styles, and they can be further customized with power-ups. 25 tracks to choose from, some are very fast, some are very technical and some are in-between.Multiplayer is a bit empty, as is the problem with many indie games, but when you get into a match everything works smoothly.

												A Wipeout or F Zero remake? Maybe, but it’s a welcomed remake and I’ve been waiting for it quite some time now. If the graphics looked dated or not up todays high definition standards don’t worry, you won’t be looking at them very much during game play. Your eyes are going to be glued to the track, preparing for the upcoming turns that will need just the right amount of pitch and yaw to advance you into the next round. REDOUT plays extremely smooth and fast. Once your craft starts moving you’ll soon find yourself performing an unavoidable habit of tilting and leaning in your seat trying to get the right body English. Raising the controller swinging it left or right during turns and loops won’t help but seems to happen all too often.  34Bigthings has done a great job filling the gap left behind for a fast paced anti-gravity racer.

												Initial impressions of this are extremely positive. A lot of these sorts of games feel quite like knock-offs, getting the look right but not realising there's more to these games than just going fast. There's a pleasing amount of drift and slide to the ships, requiring careful airbraking and lifting off to keep your speed high around the tracks.Speaking of tracks, there's 20, all of them so far quite spectacular. Rather generous for the price, and also quite a few ships to choose from.The AI will likely seem quite tough at first, there's some slightly over-aggressive rubber banding on display for the first few races which is then disabled from that point on. But in both cases the're very beatable as long as you don't spend all race grinding the walls and boost sensibly.			",156,12,11,11,7,0,12

												First impressions are very positive. Handling feels good, it's a polished product, and has a decent career mode.The handling was easy to pick up, but seems nuanced enough that I will need to practice a while before I get good. Lots of ways to take corners and it takes skill to maintain a good line.Career mode involves earning money and XP from events, and spending money on new vehicles and upgrades. There's a good variety of game modes and it's keeping me interested so far.I haven't tried multiplayer yet, can't speak on that.			",177,37,18,17,20,7,17

												This game is awesome and has been more than worth the price for me. a few important notes-you basically need a controller to play this game. The keyboard isn't ideal at all because you need the various degrees of sensitivity an analog stick provides when steering and strafing-you need to look up the guide on how to corner on the community hub if you are not really familiar with AG racing gamesbeyond that this game is a lot of fun and a real challenge. It also looks beautiful for an indie game. Its a lot like surfing in cs go where you have to run tracks just right, be buttery smooth, and the difference between flying though a turn and slamming into the wall is almost nothing.

												I haven't played for long but this game probably has the best gameplay and mechanics of any arcade super-speed racers. Graphics are beautiful too.Downfalls: no minimap. Actually another, i feel like we need some wider tracks. I mean, I get hardness of the game and stuff but add some parts where I can unleash those fire drifts bruh. Also, lacks an arsenal of weapons to rival Wipeout - would be awesome if the devs added some.Edit after 3 hours: BOSS MODE IS ABSOLUTELY NUTS!!Literally the second game I've ever bought for more than £10 (£20.40 or so) and it's well worth the price I paid.Edit after 10 hours: 34BigThings (the devs) are amazing. No DLCs included. The game is beautiful. Sure it needs a few small things, but here you have a genre with so much potential and 34BigThings came along and made it shine - in a great way. Any speed freaks and racing lovers need to get this game. Just a few small things such as an option or race type with bigger weapons and an option for a minimap would be great. What gives me chills is the fact that the game is exactly how the cinematic trailer shows it. It's beautiful, get it.			",124,17,2,16,7,0,14

												This brings back many fond memories of Wipeout for me. Not many games have caught that thrill of going absurd speeds on winding tracks, but I can honestly say that this game hit the nail on the head! Also i should add that there are control presets you can chose from / swap to on a whim. Basically if you want the classical wipeout controlls, that is just 3 mouse clicks away. My only gripe with the game as of now is the npc / difficulty / catch-up mechanics. no matter how hard I push it they can always boost past me and when I boost I don't gain on them at all. Hopefully the AI will get some fine tuning in the comming months which will make this game perfect in my eyes.Kudos to the devs, a 20 man team, for making the racing game I've wanted since Wipeout! Can't recommend this enough!			",61,7,6,12,10,1,8

												Disclaimer: Redout was my first AG racing game. I can't say how it compares with Formula Fusion or Wipeout 2048, this review is entirely based on my experience of the game as a newcomer to the genre.Verdict: 8.2/10.Review machine: Intel i7 6700K, Asus GTX1080 Strix OC, 16Gb of RAM. Asus 2560X1440 144Hz Gsync monitor, game running at 2560X1440 and 120Hz. I spent my full playtime using an Xbox One ""Elite"" Controller.Flaws:> Controller Reliant. It's absolutely reliant on a gamepad of some kind, without two analogue sticks the control scheme and driving physics fall apart. I can understand that this partially a limit of the genre itself, but I still have to strip half a point in penalty. A PC game should work on PCs, without 3rd-party devices. Buyer beware.> Flat SFX. Given how good the music is, I was quite disappointed with the ship, ambient and powerup audio. It's not exactly bad, it's just really flat and not interesting. Redout's audio focuses entirely on music, it works, but it's a little disappointing in a racing game.>Occassionally counter-intuitive track design. Most of the tracks are absolutely on-point, but a couple have killer corners that take lots of trial and error to get right. The worst offender is Spinning Pipe, which I still haven't managed to get my head around.Strengths:>Very easy to learn.... Redout is surprisingly intuitive, I came in having never played an AG racer before and within an hour I felt fully comfortable. The twin-stick control layout feels really intuitive. I can strongly recommend this as a casual game.>...but surprisingly hard to master. Although it's easy to learn, the skill ceiling is set very high and the game offers a satisfying challenge. The AI is competant and can usually keep up, some of the bonus challenges and fiendish and the track design always keeps you on your toes. It never feels dumbed-down or casual, the Class IV ships are downright terrifying on technical tracks.>Well balanced. That balance continues to the ships themselves. Each model has a unique playstyle, and yet they all feel about equal. I tested all of them around a control Time Trial, and they all lapped within a few tenths, across all four classes.>Great track design. I can't imagine creating tracks for ships this fast was easy, but Redout nails it. With the exception of Spinning Pipe I've enjoy just about every track. I particularly loved the Egyptian courses, they're fast and open with some classic corners and long straights. > It's crazy reliable. During my play of the game I encountered a grand total of one crash, and didn't notice any serious bugs. I didn't test optimisation, but given it ran flawless and loaded almost instantly on my PC I'd assume it's relatively good.			",55,2,12,6,8,0,13

												Saw references to both WipeOut and POD and immediately purchased without reading any reviews.(Would impulse buy again!!)NOTE: If your trigger finger isn't completely numb at the end of a race, you're doing it wrong!PRO TIP: Go faster.			",81,3,6,5,4,0,2

												I got this game as a free pack-in with my video card.      Usually most of those freebies are junk, but this game is just awesome!! Really brings back memories of Wipeout or F-Zero.    Also the game starts out pretty easy and starts getting very hard once you unlock some of the later races.    Tried a few online races and those are great too but I'm horrible currently and usually come in last place.     lolThe game is crazy fast and graphics look stunning!!    Have it maxed out at 1440p @ 60fps on GTX 1060.   I'm sure a better card could push this at  ~120fps no problem.			",155,18,12,18,25,0,14

												So impressed, was a big fan of Wipeout and F-Zero so picking this up and finding it had damn near everything from the genre from nice sound track to the tight and responsive controls I was instantly hooked. I don't own VR so I can't comment on that and I would like to see a ghost on time trials (not seen an option for it yet?) But this is what you are looking for if you love the AG racer genre.

												I remember playing Star Wars: Episode 1 Racers on my nintendo 64 as a kid, and actually from just about half a year ago (I rebought the game). Once when I seen a review on my Facebook feed from PC Gamer on Redout, I was curious. Within the very first minute of the game trailer I was drawn in like a fly to delicious fruit. It seemed like someone finally made a bad♥♥♥♥♥Anti Gravity Racing game into the modern times!  I will tell you, this game does not dissappoint. You feel like a pro from the very beginning, all the way until you get to your first 'difficult' race. Once you hit that race, you'll know. It's like,♥♥♥♥♥♥man I don't know if I can even win. Then the learning curve starts with you finally starting to understand the strafing mechanic, such as drifting is an important role on tight turns in this game. Easy to learn, I started having a blast once I truly learned how to play this game and race at insane speeds. That being said, I'll set a pro's and Con's list. Pro's: Visually Stunning.  Physics seem great.  Insane speed. Race track variety, Ship variety, and upgrade varieties for your ships. Optimization! and last but not least, Mechanics.Con's: Sometimes if you nudge an npc, (another ship) as your passing by, It will completely screw you over and throw you into a 360. Aggressive AI! Lastly, the game doesn't seem to save my framerate option in the settings tab, so everytime I start it I have to change it to 120.  As you can see, the Pro's heavily outweigh the cons. I mean, you might need to restart a race 6 times because of aggressive AI, but that makes it so much more rewarding when you hit that finish line in first place. TL;DR: Mechanics are great. Feels like a modern Star Wars Racers game with new features. ♥♥♥♥ing Amazing. I would pay $50 for this gem if I had to. Very optimized, and just a masterpiece of indie racing games.

												Read: basically in the initial impressions phase, but have had the game since shortly after launch, as it came recommended by TotalBiscuit.Despite being advertised as an arcade game in style, Redout has physics and ATD that absolutely beggar belief. The details are incredible, the effects are sexy, and the gameplay is tight and ridiculously nuanced. This truly is a worthy heir to the zero-G racers of old. There's a reason I only have four hours so far- the game launched in a somewhat awkward state in regards to the AI and everything drove a little too well- was quite frustrating. A few patches later that seems fixed and the game may actually be finishable for the Career mode even if you're not a god at the game- or at least that's the impression I get from the early content. Will update when I get much further in/finish the current content. Make no mistake, this game is not for the faint of heart. Hopefully the devs justify the price point by continuing to add content- the first major content update in a very long time just dropped so hopefully they aim to continue adding new content to the game completely free of charge. Solid game, not-so-solid price at the moment.To the devs: Adding 'enhanced edition' is a good way to get people to notice you updated it. It's still the same core game though, so it might be considered a little bit disingenuous and misleading.			",361,99,5,38,57,2,46

												Guys, quit playing Forza and get on this! No 30 FPS BS here. Redout basically marks the beginning of the comeback of futuristic racers. It handles kind of like a slippery F-Zero, and it lets you Go Faster Than Ever. Seriously, I've reached about 1300 MPH at times. Even the low classes let you go like 800. Anyway, it's got VR support, which is in no way a requirement. I don't have VR hardware, this is a blast on a regular screen.			",104,1,11,9,4,0,0

												This is my first negative review. The game states 4 GB of memory minimum to play it. I have 4 GB, but the game consumes more than 2.9 GB (I believe it might even peak past 3 GB). If you had only the game running on your machine, it would be OK. But there's also the OS and maybe some small programs here and there. In the end, 4 GB is just not enough.So whenever I try to play, the computer spends all his time paging to the disk, saturating it. The result is an unplayable game, with freezes every 2 seconds because it needs to load the data from the disk to the RAM, and then back to the disk.I review this game negatively because my system meets the minimum requirements, so technically it should be able to run it. And yet it doesn't. Whenever the minimum requirements get updated with an actual fair playable config I will delete this review. But for now I can't recommend the game to those like me who only have 4 GB of RAM.By the way: this is with all graphics options at the minimal settings possible.http://i.imgur.com/3cltjua.png ",119,14,8,26,17,0,28

												Finally an awesom F-Zero-like racing game on the PC. It is an arcade racer, but with some nice mechanics (drifting while turning opens up some synergies, like taking sharper turns by timing it right), active powerups, boost. Difficulty is fine. I really like the visual and audio representation. I like how the sound changes and gets more pumping the faster you go.Developers keep supporting the game so far. That brings me to the negatives. The low player base makes it hard to find / play multiplayer matches. So if you don't have friends that own the game (I'm not sure if the demo offers online play), then you are kind of limited to single player and comparing your driving skills to other drivers on the leaderboards.Still... I've had a lot of fun with the game so far and can recommend it :).			",76,67,3,11,8,1,10

												I tried the demo before buying.  This game is really fast (and I'm only on level 2 ships) and controls are very good.  You will be using both analogue sticks to control the ship, otherwise you'll be wondering why there's sparks flying every time you go up a loop the loop or higher parts of the track.There isn't much in the way of weapons as such, but, the driving alone is very involving as it is.  You WILL be boosting none-stop.  You WILL pay for mistakes.  You can't just hit the track walls and think you'll get away with it, the cpu ships will just fly past you and take advantage.Progress seems to be a mix of time-trials and races in career-mode, haven't tried other modes yet.  Earn money to buy and upgrade ships.  2 power-ups only, of these only 1 is user controllable, the other one works by affecting ship handling.  but, there's a selection of them which are also upgradable.  There is some strategy to be learnt here for the power-ups, but, I'm still learning.The graphics suit this game and the size of the game is excellent.  Small enough for me to have this installed on a 64GB USB3 stick and the game runs perfectly smooth off it.  Sound is very good as well and it's selection of electronic music suits this game.If you like Wipeout or F-zero, then, definately check this game out.  Every other racing game will seem slow after this one.  Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great racing game if you like going fast. The high speed racing looks and feels just right. There's a good variety of maps and gamemodes, and the controls are really tight once you get the hang of them. The game still feels somewhat barebones in customization but the Enhanced Edition update did improve it a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pitch up when you go up. LB gives you a boost. It's pretty but also heavy on my eyes the sparks you get when you don't pitch up on the loop I can't look at it. Turning effects to low helped a little but it's still to flashy. Music is very chill. I'm not sure yet if I'm going to keep it since I can't look at those sparks. If there is one gripe I have in Video settings you can't change resolution, so what ever your monitor is set to, that's the way you will play it.			",303,47,6,14,34,5,32

												So far, so good. At a little under an hour, I've by no means mastered it or experienced the game in total, so please bear that in mind. These are my initial thoughts.First impressions are that this feels like WipeOut. It is quick. Very quick. I'm using a 360 controller and am very happy about that. I've seen people moaning about mouse and keyboard. The 360 controls are tight as you like and each ship that I have tried feels unique - some with sluggish controls, some very responsive.The tracks are what you would expect from a WipeOut-esque title - twists, turns and huge jumps, there are loops and speed booster pads too.I'm currently partaking in career mode, I have opted to steer clear of online multi-player until I have a few more hours experience. The career mode is not for the novice racer, and this is all down to what I'd call 'rather brutal AI'. At times the AI is too tough. The rubber banding does spoil this gem of a game and will leave you cursing like you were playing 250cc Mario Kart. Mastering circuits and your boost, gaining that 1st place, only to have 4 AI whip past you and clip you leaving you facing the wrong way on a track is trigger worthy. This game would be MUCH better if the AI was turned down a little. Just a little, not too much.The perks you can assign to your vehicle are good. Whilst not amazing, they certainly help. They are very subtle as opposed to being overwhelming race winners - this I will get used to and no doubt grow to love.There are 4 camera modes to pick from, from full screen 'in-pod' to far off 3rd person.Graphically the game is very nice. It isn't earth shatteringly amazing, but it is very nice, although it could use more in the way of rounded edges. Everything looks as though its been smoothed with a battery powered sander which is running out of juice. Lighting-wise 34BigThings have nailed it.SFX are good and the backing music is a mix of EDM which serves only to drive my temper to boiling point as the AI teabag me as every given overtake.I am running this on EPIC for all settings and she runs like a dream.Well worth a purchase, it is fun, challening AND no bugs found yet - which, let's be honest is rare as hen's teeth in this day and age. This very much scratches that futuristic track racer itch that I had. Congrats to 34BigThings. You've done a mint job.PC Build played on: i5 R9 280 24GB Ram.			",287,31,29,8,18,2,10

You don't think it couldn't get any faster until you move up a class.Amazing variety of tracks - From long stretches into hairpin turn to loops and twists where you can't see the next turn unless you've raced it before.

Maybe its the grittyness or the amazing electronic soundtrack, its close, but not quite as entertaining as the WipeOut titles.I will continue to play it for now until the Formula Fusion guys catch up and finally deliver a finished title.

												This game is mostly very good. It's very much in the vein of classic high speed games like Wipeout and FZero, both series that haven't had any new entries. The graphics are great, it runs well, and it has a good variety of tracks. It is a little pricey for what it is, but it is noticeably better than a lot of its slightly cheaper competitors. I do have one issue with the game, and it's possibly due to my lack of skill but the later tracks are problematic. The developer has seemingly put more effort into making the tracks mindlessly difficult (some of the Europa tracks have allowances of literally a few pixels, if you don't hit a jump perfectly, you will end up crashing or leaving the track) than into making the tracks fun. I appreciate that it is a free DLC but I am hoping if they release more new tracks in the future, they will put a little more effort into making the tracks fun as well as difficult. I like that this is a challenging game, but sometimes it goes a little too far.100% recommend this but I'm not a huge fan of the new tracks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to love this game, I really did. Got it off humble store.But it honestly pales in comparison to wipeout and fzero mainly through bad ai, bad handling, and bad track designI played it and then went to wipeout HD/fury. Back and forth over and over to identify why I wasn't having fun in redout.Music is pretty good.Your ships are much wider than wipeout racers but with tracks of the same width or more narrow. I GUARANTEE you wil be bouncing off walls for most of your redout experience.  Scrape a wall even briefly and your speed goes to nil. Incredibly punitive.  If you try to slow down to make turns you are guaranteed to lose vast majority of the time.AI will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off because they aren't even remotely humanlike. It cheats and uses crazy rubberbanding.Handling is mushy instead of responsive. Frustrating is the best way to describe it.Strongly advise that you just play wipeout/fzero again instead of paying for this. Redout 2 will prolly be a LOT better as this first one just shows where the devs were cutting corners or were inexperienced.Online pop is like 400 during peak of release. Nowadays it is under 100. Nobody is playing this. Peeps who will like this are ones that just haven't been exposed to better racers in this genre.At $5-$10 this might give reasonable value if you aren't too frustrated and return it during the 2 hour trial.p.s. its funny but during their promo videos at the top of the steam page you can see where they cut off the wall collisions where the racer got dropped to almost zero speed			",629,125,19,82,52,5,88

												This game is a nice Wipeout-like with everything you expect from a Wipeout.Pro :- Strafing- Nose control- Weapons- Crazy high speed tracks and diverse environement- A lot of game modes- Customization of the ship (not a lot of options but enough to be interesting)- Run well on an old PC with nice graphics- The first league is quite fastCons :- rubber band AI : on some tracks if you do poorly, the AI will do poorly too which breaks the immersion and get a feeling that the AI is cheating when you do really well on the same track.An option to disactivate that effect would be nice and have an AI difficulty in function of the league of the ships, and not in function of the actual performance of the player.Side notes :To play with a Dual Shock 4, use DS4Windows.  X360ce doesn't work for me and others.The weapons system is not like in Wipeout : you don't collect weapons on the track in this game.On the physics part against AI, sometime I'm hit in the back by the AI and I do a U-turn. That's annoying but I did it to the AI too so it's only fair. The AI is not impossible to move on a railroad, like in some others racing games.I'm also glad that the design is not a ripoff of Wipeout. The devs did a great job with their own ideas and didn't fall into the trap of making a clone.			",111,18,1,11,5,0,19

												This review is from the perspective of an F-Zero GX fanatic. Back in the day, I completely unlocked every single thing and beat every single challenge and won every single race the game had to offer. I sourly regret the fact that Nintendo will most likely not be making a new F-Zero game.Redout is an incredibly fun game. The sense of speed is instantaneous. The tracks are fun and keep you on edge.The controlls take a while to get used to, and they do feel a bit slugish. I tried with a keyboard and mouse, and a controller, and in both cases, going plum straight is nigh impossible. Microcorrections are not enough of an issue to even raise a statement, but do know that they are there.One thing I can say is that the AI seems to be allowed to cheat to be ahead of you. The AI can crash into you, and you take the beating. If you try to return the favor, you take the beating. The AI doesn't ""race"" you, it's programed to do laps within a time range, and it will do whatever it can to do so. That includes outright cheating and going faster than possible on the corresponding ship.The game has a very interesting momentum sistem, which I can see as being a very powerfull tool to go even faster.Over all, I absolutely love this game, and I will be investing a lot of time into it.The only downside is that, in the 1.7hrs I've played, I've spent about 0.5 of those looking for an online game. I only ever found one, that had 4/12 players in it, and the race had already started. Once they were done, there were no open games to join. So I hosted one, and no one joined.It needs more players, so share the game, buy the game. Lets play.Gotta go fast!			",74,6,2,4,6,0,8

												Videos will show you they nailed the graphics, soundtrack and sense of speed, so all i need to tell you is that they nailed the handling too - the dual stick system is simple and intuitive, for example you can steer sharply into a corner then move the right stick in the opposite direction to drift around it.Very, very impressive game. I don't usually make impulse purchases but who doesn't need another futuristic hover racer? and this one is done right.			",345,62,20,60,27,0,68

												the best futuristic race game ever created. They dont have as money as nintendo, but whithout the fact that they didnt input a scenarised carreer you still have a far better gameplay than what Fzero ever offers. This game has no equal in the market, the gameplay is very solid and challeging. You will enjoy to feel the weight of your ship and learn to deal with.In top of that, devs regulary updates the game. So, if your looking for sensations, there's no question to hold on, you need this game.Just be warned, its a  game about patience and learning, Its not a fighting game its just about speed.For battle futuristic racing game you need to have a look on Grip.edit: I cant describe how I love this game, when you will feel tired for the first time after a race, we will begin to realize how amazing the game is. Its like when you get into a roller coaster. You feel washed and fresh after that, but really tired. Amazing to see this game give you these sensations back. Clearly the devs are very skilled...I just heared the game is not a real vr game because there is no 3d dimension, I never tried it so I cant say, but I really hope they will input that dimension in the game because Im really looking to play this game with a vr headset. What an excitig perspetive.I have to say also that devs input two massive additions which were highly anticipated by players.first - a cockpit view, the second one, a global online tableboard with your time attack best result and the ones of other players all around the world. so now I can say that a lot of you will spent hours and hours trying to beat some records. And you have a lot of tracks available. They recently added a new world which consist himself on more than 6 different tracks. And im sure they will add new worlds in the future.from far the best game I told you.			",98,16,5,16,4,1,5

												The maps are fantastic fun, it's pretty and it seems the music changes sometimes based on activity on the track.Career mode is a blast, random 'contracts' popping up, skin colours to unlock (and trade with friends) etc.I have yet broken the sound barrier, but I hear it's possible, there's even an achievement for it.Plays well on a PS4 controller w/ Input Mapper.This game can seem immensely difficult at some point through the career, but some maps aren't plug an' play and you have to learn them. Quite a few 'what the fudge' maps I ran into I had no trouble with after learning them in 'Quick Race' 'Time Attack' with 10+ laps for good measure. You do hit the walls quite a bit, but it's not impossible to avoid them, there are breaks, learning to drift and learning to take your finger off the accelerator once in a while to circumvent the track (something a lot of gamer's seem to struggle to do). Some maps will also play easier with different vehicle configurations and some may just take more practice.I'm not usually one for racing games, but I love this, reminds me tons of Wipeout.My irks;- More everything, maps, music, upgrades, ships... I can't get enough.- Multiplayer communication options (voice chat?)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The controls are easy to get used to, the AI are competitive, and most importantly, it has online multiplayer. On top of all the game has to offer, from what I hear they will be updating the game in the future! I HIGHLY recommend this game to any racing fan. Great buy.			",59,3,4,0,2,1,2

												I also covered this game on YouTube: 


YouTube™ Video: Redout (PC) - PXA Peeks - Wipeout in 2016! 

			Views: 597		

			In this episode of PXA Peeks, I take a look at Redout from 34BigThings. This is an indie developed spiritual successor to high speed, low gravity racing games like Wipeout and F-Zero and it captures...		

The developer says their influences for Redout were Wipeout, F-Zero, Rollcage and POD and as someone who played and loved all those games, I can say they nailed it with Redout. The high-speed, low-gravity racing genre is something that's been surprisingly underrepresented on PC and many of those who have tried it never quite nail the feeling right. While Redout wears its inspirations on its sleeve, it also does a fantastic job in duplicating them.The developer is a small team from Italy that had made nothing remotely like this before but it's clear they knew what people wanted out of a game like this. Redout has an incredible sense of speed and because your vehicle levitates, it doesn't handle like a normal driving game. You have to deal with inertia and make sure you lead your turns in order to avoid hitting the walls. It takes practice to get good at it but after a while, you get into the zone and it feels SO good when you do.There is no direct combat in Redout, though there are a number of different power ups that you can use to cause headaches for your opponents. Smart use of these will become critical later in the career as the AI is no push over.There is a career mode, which is really just a progression of events without any story, a quick race mode and online play. There are a number of different race types, ranging from solo time attacks to standard pack races to elimination modes to an endurance mode that hooks multiple different tracks together. The online community is unfortunately small for this game but the few times I tried it, it was smooth and lag free.Redout runs on Unreal Engine 4 and looks fantastic, even when in high speed motion. It does need a bit of optimization as even on a GTX 1080, I was experiencing some frame rate stutter in parts of certain tracks with everything cranked up. We have a Vive VR rig at my work with a GTX 1070 and some co-workers tried out the VR support this offers and were very impressed. Despite the speed, no one got motion sick and they said it was a ton of fun to play in VR, though we had to drop the detail level even further to keep the frame rate up as the stutters would instantly cause disorientation. I hope the developers can tune this up a bit.Overall, I think Redout is fantastic. It's a bit expensive at normal price but don't let that put you off if you really love this genre. There's a ton of content, tracks and car types, the online play is solid, it looks great, largely runs great and has VR support. I want to see more of this genre on PC and this is a great start to that.			",748,151,15,54,55,3,73

												It sucks that there hasn't been a new Wipeout or F-Zero game in years but Redout thankfully fills the much needed void for me when it comes to futuristic racing games. It feels like a combination of both F-Zero and Wipeout added, in fact most of these elements are from the recent Fast Racing NEOThough I will say this, if you want the full experience I recommend playing with VR. Otherwise try out Fast Racing NEO or if you don't have a Wii U then get this game			",765,159,19,84,50,9,73

												If you are ready for an upgrade ftom wipeout to something a bit harder but just as enjoyable on controls, music, and feel of speed...this won't be a let down for you.Honestly the only 2 nags I possibly think of for this game are...1. the constant speed might take away the art of the ship you're in.  In wipeout I always felt like I appreciated looking at my ship as well as the track, and to this day the ships in it stick in my mind.  It just seems like you're always looking ahead way further down the track than what is right around you. (maybe after playing longer the ships will stick more into my memory)2. the woman annoucing could have a bit more polish to it.   It doesn't feel quite futuristic enough.Like I said though, these are just things I'm trying to find wrong with the game.  I can only play a few sessions at a time because I have to unstick my hands from the controller and relax a bit.  They really did a wonderful job here, and I look forward to more of thier games or expansions.			",224,125,4,32,22,1,23

												This game is awesome in VR in my Oculus Rift! I definitely recommend this for VR!It is a great arcade-like VR-compatible racing game in contrast to sims like Project Cars and Assetto Corsa. I particularly love the combination of high speeds with very interesting tracks and environments; the inclusion of loops, dips, and jumps is awesome. As others have said, the progression of ship upgrades, ""weapons"", and tracks keeps it even more interesting than the initial racing experience already is.If there is a con, I would say the high contast colors tend to blend together in VR and can make already-challenging tracks even harder to race well on. It can also be a little harsh on the eyes after a while in the HMD. It isn't a major gripe, but an overhaul of the colors/outlines would be appreciated.			",43,16,6,0,3,0,0

												A fantastic game - if you’re looking for a fresh AG racing experience then this is for you.Your eyes will probably start watering if you get stuck into one of the 'Boss' type events which are basically 10 straight minutes of trying not to blink.Good graphics with a neat aesthetic that is just gorgeous to look at, which does a lot to make you feel like you are traveling at Mach 1. The game is engaging and I hope to see more content in the way of modes and tracks in any upcoming patches.My only gripe is that you can't rebind your keys (as of 1.0.5) so you are stuck to either WASD + the Arrow Keys or an Xbox 360 controller.

												WipeOut for the PSP was one of the first video games I've ever played. Now comes Redout, a spectacular throwback to the futuristic hovercar racing games of yesteryear. I was lucky enough to recieve this for free when I bought a GPU, but after playing a little bit of it I can say confidently that I would happily have paid full price.PROS:- Looks great- Good variety of vehicles and tracks- Lots of gamemodes- Singleplayer and multiplayer modesCONS:- Slightly repetitive OST- Controls take some getting used toOverall: not only does it appeal to those like me who adored games like WipeOut and FZero, but it's an engaging experience for newcomers as well.I haven't spent long in this game as I write this, but I look forward to spending many more hours in Redout.

												See other reviews for why the game is good.Big downside IMHO is lack of documentation. No tutorial, no explanations of how you should be driving. All trial and error. In a game so difficult that it asks you to play perfectly, this is a big deal. Took me forever figuring out how to play optimally - completely unnecessary initial frustration phase to the title.

												td;dr : This game got the perfect challenge/reward balance and it feels just amazing. If you wanna go fast, try hard and progress, just go for it.There is no doubt Redout aims at enthusiast players who grind fast-paced games in general, wether they're racing games, HL surf, or speedrun FPSs. The game becomes very difficult each time you increase your class, but it's also rewarding enough to keep me thirsty for more. If you're into tricky race games with great graphics, overall feeling then just go for it. You'll have both fun and hard time beating the AI once you reach a level that matches your skill but don't worry : you'll progress as long as you train consciously enough.Protip : Try to look as far as possible. Always focus on the NEXT corner, anticipate as much as possible or you woun't be able to keep up with your own pace.			",53,7,5,0,4,0,5

												Played both Wipeout (3 and Pulse) and F-Zero (X and GP Legends), didn't play any of those as long as I've been playing Redout over the last months.AI doesn't cheat like F-Zero and ships are actually fast unlike WipeOut.Speed comes with a few negative points, like ships having almost no weight or else collisions would hurt a lot, thus making hitting walls faster than avoiding them depending on situation.AI not cheating makes it really slow, especially in higher classes, where I'd often lap a few opponents in even the shortest races, but I've also heard lots of people still got problems with beating AI, so maybe it's just me and a few others there.Online isn't very great, mainly because the game isn't very known. If you really wanna get into online you should join the Discord Server found in a pinned Thread in the General Discussions Forum.Artstyle and Soundtrack are great, not really sure what else to say about that.Like any racing game, there's not a lot to do after you finished career except if you're into time trials or online, so make sure you're interested in atleast one of the two if you want to get alot out of it.

When the Comp. flys away with his 1st place after a few player mistakes, there is little you can do to get it back, same for the player though. This will definitely sate your craving for a spiritual successor of Wip3out, if you can handle the fact that there are no weapons. Plenty of fun still!			",117,12,7,13,11,1,7

												Controls feel real solid, variety of vehicles with their own stats (Grip vs Max Speed vs Acceleration, etc.), color options for each vehicle, and performance upgrades (albeit, no visible effect).More visible customization, maybe even changes that appear with upgrades, would be nice.Saw videos and responses saying splitscreen would be in, but can't find any option for it in game. Would make it even more stellar.			",181,38,4,15,20,1,16

This is good really good if you have the brains to cope with the speed.I am the type of person that rather boost at 1000 km/h with 5% hull than try and save the ship.Carpe Jugulum.Go for the throat.

												This game is awesome in VR in my Oculus Rift! I definitely recommend this for VR!It is a great arcade-like VR-compatible racing game in contrast to sims like Project Cars and Assetto Corsa. I particularly love the combination of high speeds with very interesting tracks and environments; the inclusion of loops, dips, and jumps is awesome. As others have said, the progression of ship upgrades, ""weapons"", and tracks keeps it even more interesting than the initial racing experience already is.If there is a con, I would say the high contast colors tend to blend together in VR and can make already-challenging tracks even harder to race well on. It can also be a little harsh on the eyes after a while in the HMD. It isn't a major gripe, but an overhaul of the colors/outlines would be appreciated.			",43,16,6,0,3,0,0

												TWO THUMBS UP.Like a technologically modern tribute to F-Zero.Doubt it's very playable without a game controller, but if you're playing racing games on a computer, chances are you'll want a controller anyways. XBox 360 controller works perfectly - XBox One controller probably works even better.Controls are fluid and responsive, premise works, earn credits, upgrade and purchase cars and upgrades (which are not usable in ""pure"" racing modes). Have not encountered any game-breaking bugs.Future racing done well: physics appropriate to game premise, responsive handling and delivers on absurdly high-speed racing. Fun competition, even with AI.Rewarding progression system, and no unnecessarily long courses. Good for arcade, and career modes.Highly recommend.Disclaimer: Got game for free with graphics card. Thought it would be trash, turned out to be great. Rare pleasant surprise!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game looks great even on tryhard settings. Having played tons of wipeout on my psp and having been a huge fan of P.O.D. Gold (my first game ever) I'm happy to say this game is a blast.Sometimes getting gold on some tracks is extremely difficult, especially on the italy tracks in tier ii i've played so far due to the unforgiving AIBut all in all, its a blast, and ended up playing until 5 AM by accident because I was so hooked, 5 hours my first play session. I really like the handling, I think its a lot more in-depth than most, I especially like the strafing and pitch. One thing I'd like is rebindable gamepad controls, I'd love to have one of my thumbsticks bound to special ability.Turn motion blur to low to set it off, lightboost 120hz is almost a necessity for this game.

												Redout is honestly the F-Zero remake I didn't know I wanted.The sense of speed is fantastic and that is essential to a game like this. even though it takes a low poly approach, it looks gorgeous as you zip past desert landscapes, metropolitan skyscrapers, and frozen glaciers at 700+ Kmph.Playing through the campaign, I've also appreciated that the AI will not hand you the win. Often times in racing games I feel it's quite easy to dominate races, especially early on. But in Redout there are no handouts, you have to know what you are doing and take advantage of all yourr resources to keep up with the competition.The sound is appropriate and the soundtrack fits the futuristic vibe of the game.Seriously, if you are looking for that F-Zero/Wipeout fix, Redout is the perfect option. Is a blast to play and I hope it gets the attention it deserves.If you're interested in seeing the game in action, here's a gameplay video:

												I fell in love with F-Zero GX as a kid and moved on to WipEout once Nintendo stopped making those games. Now that those are gone, Redout seems like it's ready to take their place and it does a damn fine job. Racing feels tight, the game is solid, unlimited FPS and an absolutely gorgeous aesthetic. You can have pure skill races as well as races where you have powerups and perks so everyone is happy.Honestly if you enjoyed WipEout or F-Zero at all, this is your kind of game. It takes the same idea of a fast-paced futuristic racer and does its own thing while still being reminiscent of the genre's best. Fully recommended at any price.			",520,175,9,57,39,4,73

												Better than I expected.  Everything I wanted from a super fast, crazy track, WipeOut style racing game.  I think that if you enjoy Wipeout type games, then you'll enjoy this.  It is pretty much exactly what you can expect from the trailer.  Plus... a FREE DEMO to try too.    I tried the demo and realized that yep, the devs seem to have done it right.Oddly though...playing in VR doesn't live up to my dreams.  I think Radial-G is a better VR racing game (the 'tube' track world works great in VR).   The Redout demo actually let you try the VR version also.   Even knowing that I probably wouldn't be playing a lot in VR, I still needed to have this game.  (Who knows, maybe the VR will grow on me).Great game.  Recommended.   Happy racing all.

												I like it. Good game. Looks awesome, goes fast. But it looks like the AI is programmed to always match your skill level. That might seem a good thing, but on my first race my lap time was 1:10, wound up in 5th place every time. Practiced on the track, learned a bit about the mechanics, and brought my lap time down to 1:02; 5th place, every time. I have yet to place on the podium in the first race after an hour or so of play. Rage gamers, be warned; this game is not for you. For all others, enjoy the bittersweet tears that result from this racing roguelike.			",140,25,9,13,16,0,5

												Very unbalanced difficulty. I could manage the first 13 levels without major problems by upgrading my ships, everything fine. But the 14th level ""Coast Pure / Abbruzo: Bridges"" is just not possible. Tried it a lot of times with different fully upgraded ships but I have absolutely no chance to get a better position than 5. Just not possible, no matter what I'm doing. And I don't see anything I could improve at all. That game definitely ends here for me (and I'm nobody who gives up early - I completed Darks Souls III 4 times). Nice game in general but that imbalanced difficulty level destroys it.

			Redout is available from Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/517710 This series features some of the best VR experiences you'll NEED to try when you get your OWN VR headsets!		

Many moons ago my best friend worked for Psygnosis, I remember travelling down to Liverpool with him for his first interview with the company. I got to meet the legend musician 'Tim Wright' aka 'Cold Storage' who did the original soundtrack for the original 'Wipeout' game on PS1. Being a musician myself we kept in touch and I was offered a place to have one of my dance tracks featured in 'Wipeout 2097'. I compossed the track and Tim loved it, unfortunatly the studio I was using to produce a 'master copy' got ruined during a  fire causing me to miss the deadline for getting my track into the game. (Yes, you can tweet/ask Tim if this is true!)So having had some experience with the original 'Wipout' I am pleased to say that having just played 'Redout' it's absolutely exhilarating! It feels faster than 'Wipeout', handling is superb, the sense of speed is stunning and I cannot recommend this title enough.yes, as a Steam Curator I got a copy of the game for FREE, but it has surpassed my expectations and by far better than any other game of the genre out there!

												Very solid arcade-ish antigravity racing game in the vein of Wipeout (that I actually remember playing on PS1 back in the day). Runs smooth, looks gorgeous with a style that sets it apart, controls great, and the difficulty is challenging and actually requires you to learn the tracks and handling properly. It's not too difficult once you get the hang of it though. It doesn't have weapons but you do get powerups to slow opponents down (or other benefits like turbos), doesn't feel like it needs them though. Very few games like this for PC so far. Soundtrack is alright too.			",123,16,10,20,3,4,18

My only complaint is the multiplayer is pretty dead, so if you want to play a non-AI race you need to bring your own friends.			",274,75,7,32,36,1,47

You will get bored of this game very fastThere's 4 tiers for every car type.http://steamcommunity.com/stats/517710/achievements/Only fifteen percent of people even reach halfway through the campaign mode to break into the third tier. 85% of people, the OVERWHELMING majority get bored and quit.Tracks only occur in 4 Mario-themed background environemnts: Dessert, Jungle, Ice, and lava. Every track is the same copy pasted theme. Jagged corners, some of which you can't see over crested hills. The real killer here is the turning. These machines grip absolutely NOTHING like in any game I've played before. You will slam into the corner of every wall whether you want to or not. Even the highest level players can't avoid contacting the walls.

			Using the Sulha ship with Active Magnetizer and Augmented Propellor. Again sorry for the quality, this game eats bitrate for breakfast -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/vallkyr		

Even the best fall prey to them. It's absolutely maddening to tap the corner, lose your speed, and watch as the AI speeds on past you. You can always hit the brakes to navitage the corner, but even then the AI still breezes past you like nothing.The hp of your ship slowly regenerates over time, so long as you don't incur any damage. In most tracks this means you don't recover any hp at all since you're married to the wall. I've played and am a huge fan of F-zero GX, Wipeout, and even Extreme G all across mutliple generations. Redout is a frustrating variant of these games with a control scheme that prohibits the player from navigating turns properly.You're denied the experience of even seeing the Jungle and Volcano levels until you grind for hours like an idiot. Enjoy only seeing the desert and ice themes since the other two are locked behind nearly impossible races.I really want to enjoy this game and its graphical splendor. Breakneck speeds tearing through winding roads in flying machines with kickass music is hard to mess up. The poor turning and controls against imposisble AI is a dealbreaker.			",355,69,3,28,16,2,26

												Short and sweet;The game was great when it was released, had piles of fun. Sadly, they've jumped on the nerf train, like so many development studios seem to do just enough time after release when you can't get a refund. Nerfing speed upgrades in a game where you're supposed to drive fast (ISTR this being the reason the developers said they didn't want to add weapons and be like Wipeout) -- makes great sense. The game might be fun again if the developers get in touch with reality. I somehow doubt it, though, if they thought the changes in the last patch were a good idea. Perhaps if they spent more time listening to the players, and less time making banal, unentertaining meme videos for the patch releases...			",50,0,1,1,4,0,3

Posted: September 17, 2016
												I wish I could recoomend this game. It really is pretty awesome. There are some fundamental problems with it, however, that push me over the edge a bit when debating whether or not to recommend.First: The difficulty is ridiculous. I feel that this game is hard not because the tracks are difficult but because the enemies are just not scaled very well. Early on you're clearly being outclassed by better ships. At least that's what you think. But when you go back to earlier missions with better stats the enemies are just as unforgiving.This leads me to believe that there is an in-built rubber banding AI. This is a complete garbage way to make the game difficult.Second: The sensetivity of the joystick (maybe its just my controller) feels really ""off"" in the menus. I've never really encountered a game where the slightest nudge on the joystick makes menu items tick. What I mean is, if you're navigating the options menu and are going up/down you need to be really careful to be straight up/down. Any slight deviation will result in a diagonal input which changes settings. This is an annoying little problem I have with the game but is worth noting nonetheless. I think Redout has some serious potential for being a fantastic game. Hell, it really is a great game. Except for the horrible AI. Oh yeah, the forced time trial stuff and general padding of the 'career' mode is annoying as well. There's a lot of the game that kind of works against itself. It shines when racing against others but has you doing solo stuff pretty frequently. You get boosts early on that don't even work until getting to the appropriate races. One other thing that is a gripe (though not really a fault of the game. More of a ""I wish it was like XXXX""). I've not encountered any races so far with very many racers. The description says it is like F-Zero. Where are the 30 person races?			",602,124,13,108,47,7,69

												Redout is both a frustrating and fun game, although often times more of the former. The maps in Redout are poorly designed, and the only way to stand a chance is to memorize them. There are many important points to make where the track designs fail: Randomly placed verticality mechanics exist in most maps, requiring to steer up and down, sometimes while steering vertically too. Some of these parts of the tracks are marked, others are not, making it a poorly communicated mechanic. Failing to adhere to this mechanic cause damage and slowing. Verticality controls are a completely unnecessary mechanic that just adds bloat, confuses the player, and disrupts the racing experience. The maps do not match the handling of the vehicles. The prime first example of this is a track called Kamsim, where at the end there’s a 180 degree turn that is impossible to make without scraping the walls. Similar flaws are found in almost every track, and increase in frequency the higher the tier. Even with ship stats maxed out, brushing against or slamming into walls is a common occurrence. Hills going up and/or down sometimes obstruct sharp turns. This makes the game feel incredibly unfair, and requires memorization of entire tracks to minimize crashes. Notice I said minimize, because again, some turns are realistically impossible to make without slowing down. Which brings me to my fourth point, does this game want me to slow down at turns or maintain my speed? This isn’t communicated, and slowing down punishes while also disrupts the experience. Arrows are inconsistent with their communication, and don’t properly distinguish sharp turns from slight turns. There is no clear indication to the player if they should begin drifting, or just make a small adjustment. Now imagine this in combination with point 3. In the higher tiers, the tracks form an enclosed tube that makes navigation impossible and leaves the player spiraling out of control. The lack of control means that when the tube opens up to a flat normal track, luck appears to be the main factor that prevents the vehicle from flying off the track. Finally, some maps are so busy in aesthetic design that they can obstruct the track, and/or cause one to lose sight of where the track is up ahead.There are some good things to say about Redout, mainly that the few best designed tracks are very fun to play and provide a reasonably fair challenge to master. The vehicles also feel very fluid in their handling, although the default input controls are unintuitive. Even the Classic setting for input controls don’t make sense because the triggers for drifting are inverted. The settings don’t save after closing the game either, and after some digging I saw that this has been a problem for a month, and while the devs do give instructions for fixing it, it is embarrassing that such a basic problem exists in the first place.Redout has power ups, but they are mostly useless, confusing, and poorly designed. A single power up is equipped before the race begins, and it can be rarely used since they seem to be tied to the energy system that allows boosting. Using the energy to boost is often more valuable than the powerups. If you are coming into this game expecting fun powerups that can be grabbed while racing, you will be disappointed. Personally, I am very unsatisfied in the power up system and would have vastly preferred a system like WipEout’s.Depending on the tier, AI are either really bad, or so good that once they get ahead, catching up is impossible. Since traditional power ups don’t exist, races in Redout quickly turn into a struggle to drive as efficiently as possible to overtake opponents.Redout needs to undergo many changes and improvements before I consider recommending it. To sum everything up, 34BigThings needs to rethink many of its mechanics, adjust tracks to be fair (or increase every ship’s handling much higher than what is current), reduce the visual noise and obstructions, introduce proper signage for the intensity of turns, and have a hard look at their AI. I would also love to see the power up system to become a more traditional one, because it would add a lot more variability and excitement to races.			",59,4,2,3,3,0,10

												Fails to capture the glory of WipeOut. The last WipeOut I played was WipeOut HD and in the end I had everything unlocked, and gold in almost every event. Yet in Redout I can't even quality in the very first AI race. I know it's supposed to be challenging but please, a little difficulty curve to ease players in before things get faster would't hurt. Secondly, the VR support (which I partly got this for) is awful. The game doesn't switch to the correct FPS for the Vive, you have to manually adjust it if you don't want to feel completely ill. Loading screens have no perspective and so mess with your eyes. A lot of text is unreadably small. In-game the HUD is just plain positioned wrong, HUD stands for Heads-Up Display, yet I have to move my head too see important details like the boost bar. Refunding this one sadly.

												Reviewing this from a VR experience. Its not the pod-racing experience i thought it would be. Even in VR you are stuck in a 3rd person perspective. When you do switch to the closest thing the game has to a 1st person perspective, you are not sitting in a cockpit of anykind. mroe like you become the ship. Im running this game using a GTX 980, and its still to fast for me to keep up with. However, The game is extreemly fun when you are playing on the regular screen, fast paced, reminds me a little of Track mainia, just a little more.... flowey I guess. The ships are hard to control, but fun to master.Summary: The VR is disorienting and disapointing, dont buy it just cause you want to race in VR. But playing it on a regular monitor is fun, just not $35 fun.			",76,13,3,3,9,1,1

												Love the game, but the developers keep tweaking the difficulty. Upon firing it up today I found that my class 4 and 3 ships were noticeably slower. Not to mention, despite nearly perfect laps, I can't break out of last place. About a week ago I was really digging this game. My placement within races was satisfying, and if I ever ranked low I always felt like it was within my grasp to try again for a better position. Now the difficulty has become soul crushing.The game is awesome, but untill the devs stop screwing with it I'm done.At that point I'll come back and write the positive review I want to post for this game.

												Disappointing. Shallow.The graphics are high resolution but low poly, so there's not really much sightseeing to be had. The online mode is doomed to fail, since success is locked behind playing the single player Career mode to unlock powerups or at least better ships, without which you're just going to be cruising in last place all the time. A game flying under the radar like this can't afford to limit online multiplayer so badly. No wonder each lobby is like 3-4 players at max, only 6 days after release. The game doesn't even populate the remaining player slots with AI racers.It's all just such amateurish game design. Yes, you can assemble a video game, but do you have the insight, the vision, the direction? At least one of you needs to be an idea guy who understands what makes or breaks a game.The game itself is a rehash of WipeOut. It looks the same from a distance, but when you inspect it from close, you see several things missing. There's no twisted tracks with breakneck curves to master. There's no style, just low poly nondescript environments. There are no pickups, only pre-equipped power ups. There's nothing much here for F-Zero X fans, either. It's a straight WipeOut clone.This game is just a bare bones attempt at cashing in on PC players who have heard of, or maybe even played a good console racing game before and are eager to have something like it on PC. Indeed, a PC player could be tricked into feeling excitement at the modest speeds and difficulty offered in this game.However, if you played one or two games like WipeOut HD, Jak X, Crash Team Racing, Burnout 3 or NFS Underground 2 like me, you'll find absolutely nothing new, exciting or invigorating in Redout. And even for those PC folk who want a racing game, I'd sooner recommend DIRT Rally, than this pointless little game. And a message for the devs: The low-poly, smooth environment really defeats any sense of speed you tried to convey. Without complex geometry to speed through, there's going to be a lack of adrenaline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(I wooke up christmas morning and it wat the first thing on my mind in fact). I love the genre. I WANT to love this game, but until the devs implement some control freedom, I gotta give a thumbs down. Players shouldn't have to find something like the x360ce emulator to control this game...

												Do not buy unless you have a compatible controller. There is no mouse control in the game (?!) and the keyboard controls are not rebindable. The layout they have chosen is.. completely ridiculous. They ask you to get used to it, but the layout will force you to hold down a vulcan nerve pinch (holding down W and left-shift with one hand, while steering with A and D) to go fast in the game, and for whatever reason the strafing controlls are on the arrow keys instead of WASD, unlike every other game on the market.The discussions make it pretty clear that nobody plays this game on a keyboard, because obviously it's unplayable.They promise keyboard rebinding in ""an upcoming patch"", but there has not been a patch in almost a year and doesn't look like there is going to be.All in all, I wish I could play this game but at present, I cannot.

												i know i only played for 2 hours. its wipeout. and we have all played wipeout on ps1. for years.here is the gist.wham!..... wham! wham!..... wham!!why are the tracks so narrow? This game would be blissful if the tracks were 3x as wide and you could have a sensation of speed for more than 5 seconds before slamming into the track wall. challenge does not always equal fun.you game devs forgot about fun a long time ago.

												The online population for this game is TINY. So, if you are getting this with the intention of playing online with others, expect long queue times and more often than not, a tiny lobby when you do manage to find one. Gameplay-wise, this game just seems a bit boring.			",23,0,1,4,1,0,0

												Don't understand why they locked the camera in VR. If I lean forward a bit, I don't want the camera to remain static... It would also be nice to be able to adjust how far away the camera is relative to the ship in VR. I don't want to be right on top of it, I'd like a more distant 3rd person view. If they can fix that, then I reccomend the game for VR. If they fix it, just consider this a thumbs up because I doubt I will go back to edit my review.			",217,42,4,21,16,6,23

												I was stocked to be able to play this game I was a big fan of wipeout. I was able to pick it up for the cyber monday deal but it was just not meant to be. Within 10 mins of playing it I got severely nauseous. Something that doesn't actually happen too often. I played many VR titles so far and was actually looking forward to play this as well. Too bad. I requested a refund on steam. I cant really recommend this game due to the aforementioned reason.			",10,5,0,0,5,1,0

												I really wanted to like this game, I thought, ""At last! someone has done a modern version of wipeout 2097!"", but my thoughts soon turned to, ""oh dear, ummm ok not like wipeout 2097, nooooo!"".Cornering:Wipeout had air breaks, this has a brake and you usually slide into the wall or slow down and move into last place due to turning too much.Feel:It has this hover, glide, glass feel to it, no controller shakes on collision with opponents or walls, it just feels too smooth it lacks the clunk, the tactility that Wipeout 2097 has/had. Sound effects don't have the contrast they need to be on activation to enhance the feeling also.Controls:There is no controller vibration on collision, turn left and right is fine, nose up and nose down is a waste of time, it's just slam it all the way up or down when something interesting is coming up. They should have built Wipeout 2097 and then if they were going to change anything gone from there.Sound:The music is fine, effects are lacking, they are a bit flat. Colliding with the track barrier or other vehicles for example doesn't really give you much notification via sound.Gameplay:One minute I'm first, next I'm spun round facing the wrong way, in last wondering what happened there? The AI needs work. I like the desktop camera angles available to you, they are fine and what I've come to expect.GUIQuite good considering it's Unreal Engine 4, GUIs from UE4 tend to look all the same but I quite like the way they done theirs.Graphics:Looks good, can't complain there, nose up and down grind effect could be done better.SummaryThe game just doesn't have any feel, it's an over polished demo of some good and bad vehicle models being moved around quite nice looking tracks. Cornering sucks, AI sucks, it lacks any feeling which is sad as it's got the speed. Sound effects are bland and blend into the background, there's no controller sensation. Wipeout, if you hit a wall you had the clunk of metal and thud noises. Crashing in Redout conveys as much a sense of urgency as a mouse click, needs controller rumble, needs different sound effects for crashing and collision and scape, they need to be way louder, collisions should be tactile, not smooth as butter or instantly overkill with a full 180 spin which happens in 0.01 seconds. I can’t see myself coming back to play this over and over like I did with Wipeout 2097.ADDITIONAL 04/09/2016Ok, I've just spent a little time with the game in VR and well here's what I found (My spec GTX980 i7 @4Ghz 16GB Ram):1. Menu area was showing signs of stutter, dropped everything to normal was fine then2. Camera positon wasn't as bad as what I've read in other negative reviews3. I didn't notice much stutter in game, only happened a few times and it was nothing to really bad4. Opponent overhead tab titles, there something seriously wrong here as I don't think they are in the correct location and the sterescopic rendering for them is incorrect as it makes my eyes go crosseyed if I am close enough to them, verry distracting and irritating5. Effects of going through full wall things also have the sterescopic rendering issue (or whatever you call it), it's incorrect and makes your eyes go cross eyed.VR SummaryI really wish I hadn't watched a developer interview for this game as the guy was saying stuff like it's the best VR experience he's ever had and how amazing it is, as I was expeting the best and what I got subjected to was something that was far from it. If they fixed the sterescopic rendering bugs and do a bit more optimisation maybe a 6/10 for a VR but then it comes back to the actual game which is... well see review above... My best VR experience is still Asseto Corsa.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks nice but needs some refinement.At first I was havuing issues with the game freezing up randomly and then refusing to load at all. I reinstalled the game and then it seems the problems have gone, so it must have downloaded incorrectly the first time.The game doesn't seem to have any difficulty adjustment and the defauilt difficulty is way to hard at the beginning. While playing so far, I have only been able to get a bronze on the first level and can't get further than 4th place on the second level. Getting 3rd place (basically Bronze or higher,) is the minimum place to finish in order to continue. Considering the fact I am usually pretty good at racing games, it shows the difficulty is set way too high. This is going to put off a lot of people and as it stands right now I can not recommend this game. The difficulty of the game either needs toning down a bit or having some kind of adjustment possible.Unless you are a real hard core Gravity Racing fan, I would not suggest you buy this game in it's current state.EDIT: - After writing the review, I decided to give it another try and the game is refusing to load again. It really needs fixing. In it's current unplayable state I have no choice than tell you not to buy it until the problems are rectified and I am going to have to request a refund. It's a shame as I was actually looking forward to playing this game.			",155,29,4,16,11,0,19

												Hey so I never write reviews but well there is always a first time, first of all I must say I had fun with this game but there is a moment when the game stops being fun at all, the AI gets way to OP and some tracks design its pretty damn stupid near to impossible to play and there is a point on the game where the AI starts to use a power up that basically when you are behind an opponent gives you a BIG boost of speed and energy so its very easy for you to be left behind, so you MUST start using it, anyways here we goPROS:-very good visual effects and enviroment-currency in the game its well made meaning you will have what you need to advance without going back to old tracks-SPEED, a lot of speed-the online is kind of meh but is more fun than playing with the AI-diversity between power ups and events-music CONS:-high levels after class III are frustrating, near to impossible either for the AI or the map-I told you the online is kind of meh right? well there are some hacks out there for the game so you know, its not developers fault but still those players pretty much kill the experience for others-AI is extremely aggressive, I must say the one game where AI is tougher than real people xD, so if you dont like being beat by the computer dont buy itThe game is pretty fun maybe I just suck at it but Im done, its ok to be hard but as I told you gets kind of boring being first the all race and at the end finish 4th cause the AI got a godly speed boost out of nowhere xD, I would say the hours I have on the game are the enjoyable ones and not so much xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had high hopes for this only for it to be shattered on the first few races.The game just somehow feels wrong, the handling is like pushing an ice cube on glass. There doesn't fell like any skill is needed. The tracks feel uninspired, being really dull and lacklustre despite it's somewhat pretty minimal visuals. Way to simplistic for an anti-gravity racer and in all honesty it really feels like an over blown mobile game.			",84,18,2,4,3,0,1

												- Some tracks have blind corners like wipeout, but here they're high speed. I don't like it.- Sometimes colors/flashes/blips are too distracting and it's difficult to distinguish the track from the background- AI feels like cheating from race 1.I had fun with time trial but career feels too grindy, I'll re-buy if price drops consistently in the future and AI gets patched.

												While the game certainly is the best spiritual successor to its inspirations currently available on the market, those of us who like a difficulty curve for the purposes of learning will be sorely disappointed. Be warned; this games AI is merciless in its perfection from the very start, and there is nothing you can do to adjust that to your liking. Where the Wipeout series had different speed leagues and (later) the ability to adjust the AI difficulty, this game has only one speed and only one AI setting, both of which are unforgiving. If you think you were good at any of the games it lists as inspirations, you're a lot better off than anyone who has never played them; this game is not for newbies to the genre, and it scoffs at even the most experienced Wipeout players.TL;DR I got a refund for this game as it suffers from game developers getting too good at their own game and setting the unchangable difficulty to extreme.

												not the type of game I would recommend unless you wish to break your computer the controlls are unresponsive and very awkward (even with an xbox one controler) this makes it hard to dodge walls witch dramaticly slow you down the courses do not help in this matter since they constantly jerk you about producing large amounts of lag making it almost imposible to tell where next wall is going to be. also if you slow down a little bit or die it is almost if not imposible to catch up to the AI. The only redeeming factor is the art design which looks like a basic collage level game disigner and programing and let me tell you that I know more first year programers that can do a better job than this and it will run better too.

I felt like I was watching a movie - with ""A LITTLE CONTROL""  couldn't ""stick"" some turns - maybe after upgrading the ship? I was bored to soon to pay the price. At 14.95 I'd maybe have kept it. Maybe I'll buy when on DEEP sale... but then again - why?Not sure why but the black and white ""LOADING SCREEN"" made me cross eyed. (like 3D was off or something - I had to close one eye to tolerate it). Wasn't optimized well-  I had some jitter and have I very high spec machine and new 1080 founders card. I also got motion sickness. (rare these days from other games).  I think due to the occational jitter. (turned down almost everything) still jittered.   Over all could not justify the price.

												TLDR: Full game that feels like early access. Even when driving well enough to consistantly earn golds, it just felt bad. Sorry, but your AG racer is in another castle.(edited: now with even more opinions!)I'm familiar with and have loved the AG racing genre ever since Pod Racer (of which the Sulha AG seems to be an obvious reference). I had very high hopes for this game when I stumbled upon the store page prior to release. The trailer lead me to believe this to be a beautiful and well polished game, but in fact, it feels like early access to me. The sad truth is it just doesn't feel or look half as good as the games it compares itself to. Maybe a lot of design choices were to make sure it performed well in VR, I don't know, but regardless I'll just keep waiting for someone else to come along and do it better. Heck, if there's a Redout 2, I'll be sure to check it out.So here's why I'm returning this game:-Very bare bones experience with no story, cinematics, or track intros.(What bugs me here is that you have no chance to appreciate the scenery. Good luck looking around while driving!)-No tutorial to get you used to how you are supposed to take sharp dips/climbs/turns.(yes I too hate tutorials, but it'd be nice to get just even the briefest demonstration of the unique controls and mechanics here, just so I'm not wondering whether I'm missing something)-Missing sound effects?! Collisions and explosions seem to make little or no sound. Maybe that's a bug or something, but it sure feels odd when you explode and all you hear is the music and the other racers whizzing past your scattered debris.-Sharp turns always feel terrible. part of this is the frequently transparent walls, part of this is that drifting doesn't seem to be a thing here (though you can strafe while turning, which is kind of sort of the same thing?), so even the AI frequently bops a wall here and there on  sharp turns, and scrapes on sharp climbs. Again, not sure if it's supposed to be this way or not, as there are no tutorials. (Maybe this is my choice of racer? I looked up some discussions on how to take sharp turns, and I wasn't taking them the way people generally recommended, but I still managed to consistantly take 1st place soooo...?)-Just general laziness in presentation. The way the low-poly medal drops down into view at the end of a race? Are you kidding me with this? Not just unsatisfying, but downright ugly.-Assuming I'm not missing something, I burned through half of career mode in my short time with the game, getting gold on each event. Career mode may be a touch of a cakewalk for veterans of the genre.At the end of the day, this game advertised itself as a better racer than I'd ever played before, but ended up looking and playing like one of the worst. (don't get me wrong, the tracks were indeed pretty, though lifeless. It's nearly everything else other than the pretty tracks that I dislike)			",323,48,5,13,15,5,26

												I'm marking this as a no only because I have to turn the graphics down so low that the landscape in this game doesn't look as good as it shows in the pictures. And even then it was slow.Edit 1: Let me explain more about it. To me, the controls felt weird, I always forgot that the you had to figure out that you need to lift off the ground when you went around certain sections of the track, another thing it most racing games you have a button to drift, this one didn't so while I'm thinking ""Oh theres gonna be a drift button to help go around certain curves"" there wasn't making it some what hard for me to get off the wall. So I went a saw the controls of the game and played a quick race and I still managed to hit the wall at least once because of how much you ""drift"" around the corner which barely moves you. Another thing is the boost. In the game you get a boost which is why the game advertises that you go as fast like in F-Zero. Well the boost is nice, it doesn't seem to help you if you're in last place really. Well I'm in 4th or 5th, I would use the boost to catch up, only to go to fast and hit a wall. So my main point of this edit was to explain why I didn't so much like how fast the boost was was and how the ""drift"" worked in the game. If only the boost was just fast enough for you to catch up to a player and not fast to the point where it made you pass a player and hit a wall just to get passed the player, and the drift was a tad bit better I would probably give this game a recommendation.

												Being a Wipeout fan back in the PS days I was excited to see this game. But, after playing was disappointed. For me, this game feels stiff and very static. I don't get the sensation that I'm actually controlling a vehicle like this, it's more like a roller coaster ride? Without a chance for the tracks to present a challenge... I got bored fast.

												I know I've played it for not too long, but I immediately realised that this games is not for me (hence, not for players like me)All I've seen while playing was a plethora of lights, rays, sparks, etc. Didn't understand what was going on or why as for example, on racing though the loop on the first unlocked circuit. Every time I passed through it, everything went dark and there was some lightings hitting the ground coming from nowhere. Crazy and confusing racing which I guess is what many players wants, but definetely not me. Then, the camera options were quite simple and dissapointing to me. You can choose a lower POV so close to the ground you can't see anything. Then, another view from outside top of the vehicle and finally another one which is almost the same but a bit further away. It's a shame not having a cockpit view on a VR game.Would I recommend it? I'd do only for players whom love this genre. Unfortunately Steam only allows me to judge between Yes or Not, so thinking only on players with my profile (have a look to my library to see what do I like to play), I can't recomment this game.

												Attrocious difficulty curve. The controls are bad. Even with the guide not matter how much you improve your time you cannot even take a position besides the last in the first race. It is like nobody play tested this thing. There is no sense of progression, you never feel you improve since no matter how much you do the A.I. will still always be better than you. To bad because this had potential...I really have no idea why people like it. It is nothing like wipeout, it is nothing like F-zero....There even if you were attrocious player you could have fun. This game is completely different on that respect. There is absolutely no sense of satisfaction in the beggining at least. And i am not going to risk the ability to refund just to find out if this changes later. I have no idea what they were thinking not giving a player some slack at least at the start...

												I really wanted to go fast but found it difficult to do so. The game has a lot of content locked for the sake of progression which is fine but none of the upgrades seem to be specially impressive. The biggest game changers are the higher level vehicles and you have to pretty much grind races to gain levels in order to unlock them, if you have the money for it.As far as performance goes it looks great and runs smooth using a freesync display at 144Hz.specs: i5-4690k, r9 390, 16gb ddr3 and i was getting about 100fps on average.My only issue so far is that vibration doesn't work, if its there at all, with the xbox one controller.If it was 15-20 dollars I would recommend it but seeing as the online is already a ghosttown and a lot of stuff is locked behind grinding I'll have to refund it for now.

												Not sure why they ripped off Star Trek, and has potentially exciting gameplay, but I feel there could've been more done.Daring Shortcuts, wider tracks, obstacles...Great for F-Zero nostalgics, but that's a little bit of a niche isn't it?What about us Sonic R lovers?Also, you can't start a race immediately, you have to wait 120 seconds, even if both pilots are raring to go.

												Woooboy, this game makes me sad/happy. On the one hand its got all the art style and music you'd expect or want from a wipout clone and handles really well, but damn if the resolution in VR makes UI and anything more than 50 ft (in game scale) ahead of you a low rez mess!

												Bought it because I'm an F-Zero fan - WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. Highly recommend if you've got a VR headset. The low poly counts are good for a lower-mid-tier VR rig like mine too (gtx 1060, i5 4460, 16gb ram). Butter smooth, familiar F-Zero ish physics (ever play the arcade version with the steering paddles?) - great fun - as a casual gamer.HOWEVER - for the average gamer I would not recommend for the price point. I feel like if this was dropped to a $25 it could creep into the must-buy lists of VR racers. It's a compelling experience, but I feel like only sci-fi racer fans will shell out and find it truly worth.ALSO - this game does not feel unfinished - and doesn't feel like an extended tech demo - that's a big plus for me.

												9/10Fast paced F-Zero action.Pros- Super smooth framerate on 4k (I have a 1080)- Beautiful graphics- Unique style of anti-gravity racing- Gorgious maps- Bots are very difficult later on in the game- Lots of levels- Pretty cool vehicles- Good upgrades- Useful and cool powerups- Great music- Online capableCons- There are very few people playing online- No split screen- Upgrading your car could be a little more involvedI really can't think of anything else on cons lol. Its a great game and if you get it on sale, it will totally be worth it. If you have some buddies to play online with, then the online is cool. Otherwise, just know that this is virtually a single player game. It is fantastic as a single player racer though. You will not see speeds like this in any other game. You go blisteringly fast. It is truly incredible. Message me if you want to race. I may not be available always, but I would totally dig a 4-6 person race online. That would be a blast.			",161,13,4,7,6,0,8

												*First Impressions*If you enjoy wipeout or F-Zero you will enjoy this game. It has the same feel in terms of race tracks, sound, and general theming. The control scheme i think works well for the game, but doesn't feel as tight as something like the old wipeout games where each turn required good use and timing of air brakes. This is something i would like to see improved upon but really is a minor issue in comparrison to an otherwise great game so far.Highly Recommend ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Redout is a game developed and published by 34BigThings srlRedout is a really fast paced racing game, that offers a long campaign, onine matches, and an abdundance of different race typesThe controls in this game take some time getting used to, even if you already played games like WipeOut before.It was a challenge to get used to this style of racingBottom line though, once you get used to the game, it loses most of the frustrations you first experienceThe graphics in Redout are pretty nice and the music is pretty coolIf you like fast paced racing games, you don´t dislike challenges, and you are a nostalgic WipeOut fan - you´ll get your fun out of Redout, the only sad part is, that there aren´t too many players playing online...

												I never played Wipeout or any of the other well known games of this genre so I can't compare how good this is to those, however I did play Fatal Inertia on the xBox 360 which was awesome!Currently lvl 17/Tier 2 (nearly Tier 3) and enjoying the hell out of this! Very fast paced but doesn't feel too fast that it's too hard to control (not yet at least). Constant 60 fps with everything maxed on my i5 4690K and GTX 970 and looks absolutely gorgeous!Only have 1 real issue with this game which is the awesome looking Conqueror line of vehicles are a bit meh when it comes to how well they perform in races. Great top speed but most levels are too bendy to take full advantage of this. I feel they need more of one of the other stats to make up for this, maybe health (structure) or one of the energy ones. It's not that bad though as it seems they all perform close enough that their weaknesses aren't too noticeable, but still.Bottom line: amazing game and well worth the money! I bought it on a Humble Bundle sale for ~£14 but I'd have still been happy paying full price for this! Would be nice to see some more colour schemes and vinyl patterns added in the future (like a nice Purple one!). And possibly a small appearance customisation thing but I'm aware this might be asking for too much haha. Maybe as a £5 DLC? I'd be happy paying that. Anyway, go buy it if you like this type of game, it's awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is more energizing than a gallon of coffee mixed with a gallon of energy drink (also much better than how that combination might taste!) and radiates adrenaline with great graphics, bright colors and beautiful environments that radiate hype. The turns are hard and require a lot of practice, but are also a fun challenge. The AI might be hard, but remember, not everybody can handle virtually going so fast that motion blur makes you only see straight ahead. In all, Redout is most definitely an energizing game with beautiful aesthetics, and fun challenge.			",6,0,1,1,2,0,1

												Got this game when I got my 1050 Ti from newegg (thanks Nvidia!) and this game is absolutely great.  You're going really fast, and the game's controls make you maneuver very well, hitting a wall will be your fault and not bullsh*t.  This game is a lot like FAST Racing NEO on Wii U, trying to be a new F-Zero and whatnot, but this game does it much better.  I just wish more people were online.			",8,0,1,1,1,0,1

												Amazing racing game.  Best racing experience I've had since the demise of Wipeout!  I have loved pretty much everything about it except one thing.   There is this infuriating situation that keeps happening :  When you hit another ship or it hits you, often it make you do a 180.   Drive me nuts.  The rest was amazing, lots of races, cars and modes, fantastic music, etc.  Very challenging too, but fair.  You get better when you start knowing the races and it gets very technical when you go fast enough to get redouts and blackouts.I am now done with all the gold medals, but discovered late game that there are platinum medals, so it's I still get to play some more even if I'm technically done with all the events.Loved the game, go buy it!

												I used to love playing wipeout and hydro thunder on the ps1 and this game is even better! The controls are like a flight sim for a hovercraft, you use both control sticks. This make the controls very nuanced and responsive, but also a bit of a learning curve. That's not that you can't pick up the game and immediately have fun, but 8 hours in, I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of some of the advanced turning technique, like strafing into the apex of a turn, or strafing in the opposite direction as the turn to start turns at a steep angle.The graphic and music are awesome. I have an $80 graphics card and I can run this a max settingsThere are only 3 things I would change. First, the power up button should be mapped to rb. Second, the augentation screen is a little dull and it would be nice to have some sort of visual demonstrating what each power up does. Third, all the tracks are linear and it would be nice to have some sections that branch into multiple paths or that open up onto terrain.These are all very minor complaint, this really is a fantastic game. 10/10 I very much recomend.

												This game is intense. I have been playing it on the Vive. The sense of speed is immense and the aesthetic is gorgeous. The career mode is very good at getting you adjusted to the learning curve until eventually you're careening at full speed through the huge winding, curving maps flying by the seat of your pants. I actually have to take breaks from playing because of how much my hands hurt from strangling my controller during the insanely fast paced races. Taking a set of turns perfectly at full speed feels awesome and there is a very high skill ceiling.The variety of the ships is nice, and I love the low-poly simplistic visual style. The game features four tiers if racer from a good variety of ""companies"" and each ship can get rudamentary upgrades to each stat, with an upgrade system that allows you to fully flesh out any aspect that your ship is weak in.My only complaing with the game is that I'm getting a lot of artifacting on the vive. It doesn't occur on the 2d monitor version. But in certain fast paced areas like the parts where you're nose it pitchine down very quickly there is an annoying flickering. This may be a limitation of my hardware(4770k/Fury X), but turning down the graphics settings helped a decent bit. If you're a fan of this type of racing game(Similar to F-Zero and Whipeout), this game is for you. It truly is a worthy successor of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 23, 2016
												I have to say, that after 18 hours of extensive ''tunnel-visioned'' racing in career mode I've developed a love/hate relationship for this game. This does not need to be a bad thing however considering I felt the same for other titles where relentless resolve are needed wich in turn rewards you with that cocky smirk and bragging rights that comes with it.This beauty of a gem is an excellent choice for those that miss the seamingly returning arcade racers like Wipeout, F-Zero and Rollcage series. With an intressting and vibrant artstyle it never fails to please the eyes, once you get the chance look away from the road that is and with some fitting soundtrack to go with the speed of sound. The controlls are very solid when you get used to them (Keep in mind that I haven't tried out VR mode) and they seem fair, especially the strafing wich are vital in every curve you'll encounter. However Redout has some problems that I'd like to adress mainly the lack of online matches. The multiplayer mode is almost deserted ((save for maybe one or two players that seems almost euphoric everytime we find each other)) every time I fire up the game. I believe this might be the cause of players that may feel deterred from the strong difficulty that comes with this monster of a title. And this also brings me to the point where I think the most players have complained the most, the merciless AI opponents that blast past you during the final lap, those hyper fast ships that plows through your own leaving you spinning like a turned up side down turtle making you go from first place all the way to last.! Aside from this, Redout is certainly as fast paced as it makes it self out to be that will sate that thirst for high velocity. Played in modarate sessions is my recommendation otherwise you will hurl the closest blunt object in any generall direction.			",62,11,1,17,2,1,4

												It's pretty sad that in 2016 I still haven't found a game to replace Wipeout HD/Fury. Somehow in 8 years no one has managed to capture the magic of that game, but damned if I won't stop trying to find a successor, spiritual or otherwise.As far as I'm concerned this is close enough for the time being. And that's very high praise coming from me.The companies all have 4 seperate cars, each company is visually distinct and has handling/stats connected to their craft. The visuals are an odd mix of basic and beautiful, while I miss the almost ""semi-realism"" of Wipeout it's visually pleasing for the most part.Now you might have noticed a pattern in this ""review"", I'm basically just comparing this to Wipeout HD/Fury. Honestly as much as I wish I could view this as it's own game, I can't. It's too similar in too many aspects and ultimately falls short of what honestly is a game I doubt I'll ever find a real successor to, but it's worth the asking price of $35 if you like AG racing games.tl;dr it's no Wipeout HD/Fury but it's a good game that can stand on it's own for the most part.http://i.imgur.com/34Mg17Q.png ",307,54,12,18,24,2,30

												This is a combination between Wipout and F-Zero.It's an extremely fast hoverrace game.Pro's:-Gameplay is tight.-Graphics are amazing.-Sound is very satisfying and music is good.-Tracks are amazing and aren't flat like usual race games.-Easy to learn very hard to master.-NPC's are hardcore.Cons:-It wasn't rly marketed enough, tis game needs more players, ofcourse private matches will always work.But if you want to play against randoms then you're basically♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck, this  game needs more players and maybe crossplay to achieve that.-Could do with an optional tutorial, the game goes so fast that things like strafing are easily overlooked by newcomers.-Would be cool if they added a replay button so I can relax while watching my latest performance.Conclusion: It's an absolutely awesome game, but it needs a bigger playerbase. But if it doesn't get a larger player base then it's still worth it for the private matches with friends and vs the AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For VR, this is it.  Probably the absolute best archade racer in VR right now. If you love rollercoasters, you will love this game in VR. Motion sickness has not been an issure for me at all. But I've done some pretty hard core flying in real life. That said I've run into real motion sickness on some titles. Not this one, but it is super intense playing this game. And it's fun. The graphics in VR look nice with little issue. And the controlls are unique and there are 3 otions for the way you controll the ship that suits your style. I went with the L & R side drag brakes on the triggers. It make way more sense. Other games like this are Radial- G which is also really fun, but a lot more neon and black. The Redout world makes a little more sense. And the colors are nice.			",72,11,10,3,3,0,7

												So i bought redout (returned it because at the time my pc was acting up with this game only, found out it was my graphics card sad faec) 2 days after it came out because the trailers and gameplay sold me.In my short time of playing, I really enjoyed the game. Its an adrenaline-rushing Anti-Gravity 3D racer that is beautiful in every way. The graphics, flawless. The music, a perfect match for the gameplay. Speaking of gameplay, its hard, like REALLY HARD. I haven't played an AG racer in a while so I got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me on the first level.But its very rewarding. Nothing beats that feeling when you finally get that gold medal, when you master drifting out of tight corners and burn the boost, when you get 1st AND HOLD IT TO THE END.Its a hardcore game, an artpiece in my opinion. Is it worth the cost? I believe so			",37,1,1,2,5,0,11

												Wow, okay. This was a surprise, and threw me back a little. This game is an extremely competent take on the AG formula, and it came completely out of left field. And from an unheard of indie developer no less. Just colour me humbly impressed that there's still indies out there that remember what fun games look like. I'm a huge fan of the AG racing genre, where in my (probably biased) opinion the pinnacle so far has been WipEout HD. That game is probably my favourite of the last ten years, and it's one of the few games I was proud to have the Platinum Trophy in. I still boot it up once in a while to this day, and it's the only reason I still own a PS3, or even turn it on. But this is definitely a genre I've always wanted more representation on PC. And I've been patiently waiting for Formula Fusion to come off the back-burner. But let me tell you, with WipEout HD starting to get close to a decade old, I still haven't seen a more modern take on the genre. That is, until Redout. It seems it's not a well-loved style of game, which I assume is because these kinds of titles don't tend to be terribly accessible. But they're extemely rewarding and they only get more fun and satisfying as your skill improves and you master the art of cornering and strifing.Anyway, I'll stop reminscing and get to the point: this game has been tickling me in all the right places. It'll probably be my addiction for the next few weeks.Pros:+Interesting and tight control scheme NOTE: Anyone complaining that the ships pilot like a wet bar of soap really don't understand this genre or that there is method in the madness.+Great performance (100+ FPS on EPIC settings) +Rock-solid stability (One of the few games lately that has been the opposite of a crash-fest)+Great art style, simple yet eye-catching+Plenty of tracks and track variety, especially within the same biome+Great but fair progression system, which is usually what these kinds of games lack+Plenty of game type variety and plenty to do in career modeCons:-Combat is a little muted, due to being limited to one type of offensive power-up-Online mode seems to be strangely and unfairly balanced-As far as I'm aware, there is no advanced manevring, such as side shifting or barrell rolls-Single-player difficulty balancing seems a little random at timesAll and all, this is probably the best stab I've seen taken at the genre in recent memory, It was more than worth the asking price. Any DLC for this game is a guaranteed purchase from me, and I want to do nothing more than support and encourage these developers. I think Formula Fusion has a real good competitor here, and they beat them out of the gate.			",204,64,7,29,13,0,16

												After a few hours of play I can savely say, that this game lives up to the hype around a real F-Zero/Wipeout successor. The sense of speed in this game is absolutely stunning and is a lot of fun.The tracks are well designed. At the wormholes that connect different parts of the tracks and at other parts there seems to be a bit of a framerate drop, even when I lower the settings (when everything is on lowest, it seems to work most of the time, but c'mon!). Also I have to say, this game is quite hard. And it can be frustrating at times, when you fly a perfect round and then some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥AI rams you from behind and you lose everything...And now, the biggest flaw of them all: IT HAS NO SPLIT-SCREEN YET! Now, I know, the devs have confirmed it to be released in a later patch, but SRSLY wtf? This game is MADE for split-screen!So if you are like me and want to play this in split-screen, maybe wait a bit until the patch is out. For everyone else, that loves F-Zero, Wipeout, etc. I can recommend this, if you can overlook the minor flaws...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												okay, I'm going to change my review here.first I couldn't get Redout working in my Oculus, when I start this game from desktop icon but later when I launched this game from SteamVR, I was able to see screen from my Oculus. ( I got some error message so had to remove HMD once and re-insert)so I would say, it still has some compatibility issue but can get it working.there are other game that I couldn't run in SteamVR although it say it working.. so perhaps this is better than those (Detached for example). anyway, so far, Project Car on Steam shows best compatibility and hope that Steam and developer can do better on Oculus interoperability over time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really want to love this game.  It's very close to being what want to have in a Sci-Fi VR racer.Sept 2016SETUP: Vive ; Alienware 51  B class rig with 980Ti ; Xbox one controller ; no tweeksGOOD: Feeling of speed ; Field of view ; AI ;  level of difficulty ; Menu interface ; OptionsCOULD USE A TWEEK:  1.Contrast of track visuals to background visuals (very hard to focus on vital info vs. eye-candy) and it's all coming at you very fast.  2. ""Flight feeling""  The feeling of mass is not quite there.  Between turning the ""wheel"" 20% and 50% feels like a dramatic change in the handling of the craft.  Again Mass of craft does not feel like a real craft.  One feels as if we have to learn the way the programers are thinking vs how a real object would handle.  This seems most apparent when aproaching a turn with the track highly banked.  One expects the center of gravity to move to the floor of the track but the craft still slides around further than expected.3. Track visuals ;   any ""S"" curve is a mess of visuals.  The track at times seems to melt into inself.  The border rail will appear only when its too late to avaoid.  You just can not judge any proper appex. The translucent textures are bluring with the textures behind them.I did try tweeking the options.Don't get me wrong.  I enjoy the game. But I feel as if the race feel would be great if..... just the track was in a black void   or,  Track surface did not constantly change color and texture. Yes, visualizing and memorizing the track is part of every racing game, but now I feel as if I have to memorize the second turn as red with blue streak down the middle , turn back when blue streak changes to purple and you loose focus of the whole track when getting to close to the blue border wall,; unless the border wall turns red, then just get ready to hit the boost after the craft comes to a stop because you are going to hit the wall.  ah.  Sometimes it really is fun to race within an acid trip kaleidoscope, but at other times, YIKES.Final thought.  BUY this game.  Its fun and trippy.  If you like speed and a learning curve this is for you.  If you smoke a bit of weed I image this would cause you to loose track of what day it is.The people that built this have done a great job and should be supported.  Everyone gets better at what they have a passion for, and you can feel the love that was put into this.;Add mass to crafts;Track colors should be a seperate group / dir from background colors;eat more fruitStoneFish			",96,27,7,5,17,4,4

												So far, Redout is everything I'd hoped for from a modern AG racer. It's like the handling and some of the style of Wipeout was married to the insane speed of F-Zero and this is the result. It looks absolutely gorgeous and the feel of the controls is perfect. The track designs are great and fun to get to learn. I'm not too far into the game yet, but the difficulty curve seems pretty good so far. I like the fact that there are different powerups available to mix up the gameplay but none of them are particularly frustrating to be hit by, unlike the offensive weapons in Wipeout or kart racers. Nothing gets in the way of the fluidity of the game.Only downsides at this point: graphics requirements are pretty high, the post effects can sometimes obscure the gameplay and make it hard to see what's going on, and there's no customisable controls (just three preset control schemes). A few people have commented on rubber-banding, and it seems like there is some, but not enough to feel unfair. The tracks are totally linear, and I miss the split paths and open areas that were sometimes found in Wipeout, but overall their design is outstanding. Gravity is basically ignored; the tracks loop and twist everywhere.Overall, I can't recommend this enough. It's exactly what I wanted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Redout - VR Gameplay HTC Vive 

			Views: 1,275		

			Fast, Crazy, Futuristic, FZero style racing game. Definitely hit me with some SNES nostalgia. It really did capture that original FZero look and feel.		

Definitely a fun trip down memory lane. They really captured that F-Zero nostalgia.Pros:Graphically appealing and nostalgic in most places.Easy to pick up difficult to master.Ahh the memories of crashing into walls in F-Zero for the SNES...Decent number of ships with a progression system.Good sense of immersion and presense. There were quite a few times I felt myself leaning into turns or on the edge of my seat while chasing the lead.Cons:Price. Even on sale, $31 is pretty hefty. Not quite sure it's worth that to me and if I had a redo, I wouldn't. Outside of the nostalgia, I'm not big on racing games but it might be worth it to a racing fan.Loading screen, it drops you into a static image which just doesn't feel good when you have the headset on. It's jarring and moving your head aruond like that is motion sickness inducing. I typically have a pretty solid stomach for not getting VR motion sick however this was still unplesant.Some areas of the game seem to be missing textures/models such as looking around before starting a race. Might be design but it's out of place next to the virbrant and bright neon on the track.In game menus need to wrap around the user. Seeing some of the ends of the menu was not optimal. It could be done but it would be nicer if it was curved.The AI are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and will run you off the road without fail.I'm going to give it the thumbs up simply because I think racing fans will enjoy it. Personally I've got a bit of buyers remorse but that's mainly from the price tag and knowing I didn't enjoy it enough to probably ever play it again.			",217,50,5,11,25,2,9

8/10 - Finally PC got its very own WipeOut!Redout is pure speed paired with excellent controls. Thanks to the design decision to make this racer a low-polygon game you’ll get an impression of speed that’s hard to be found elsewhere. Thanks to the incredible speed and the beautiful UE4 effects you’ll hardly notice the low polygon count while racing. The physics of the Anti-Gravity (AG) racers feel right too, a thing most WipeOut clones failed to do. Push two magnets together and you get an idea how a hovering AG-racer should behave. 34BigThings got it right!Breaks? Who needs em?!Kudos for the course design too! All courses are carefully build with one goal: you don’t need to break to master them. The precise and reactive controls allow you to steer and strafe (an active slide to the left or right). By skillfully combining these movements you can master sharp curves without a touch on the breaks, a very satisfying flight experience (like a hairpin in Rally - just much, much faster)!I highly recommend a controller to master this beast of a racer. While mouse and keyboard are okish, you struggle to maintain all the controls with the same precision of two analog sticks.With Redout PC players finally get a worthy AG racing game. The sheer speed is just breathtaking. After my first 30 minutes I took a little break and played Forza 6. In comparison, chasing over Bathurst in a Porsche 959 almost felt like driving through a residential zone.Positive:Extreme speed and performanceExcellent steeringAdaptive/dynamic SoundtrackRacer upgrades and racer mods7 different race types, 20 tracksModerate priceNegative:No Resolution settings, the game uses desktop resolution as standard (might be a problem for some users), can be changed manually in ini. Will be fixed with an upcoming patchHigh learning curve: the game starts at incredible speed right away and so do the A.I. racers. On the other hand they don’t get much harder on higher tiers.(34BigThings will address this is an upcoming patch and slightly lower the AI difficulty in the starting tiers)Controller functions are not fully customizable (there are three controller layouts)Played on: i7-2600k, GTX970, 16 GB RAM, PS3 Controller (with DS3 tool)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you miss Wipeout or F-Zero? If yes, buy this game.  A clone of neither of those, Redout is a unique take on the genre. Amazing sense of speed, heaps of race types and campaign missions, 6 vehicle manufacturers with a unique ship in each of the 4 speed tiers (total 24 ships), and online multiplayer.  The race type 'Boss' combines heaps of segments from different tracks into one huge 3-4min lap track. It's so much fun.  AI are a bit wonky though. Annoyances at their best. Complete chumps at their worst. They never feel like real competitors.			",64,6,3,13,6,0,4

The speed is so tremendous that I litterally have to catch my breath after holding it for so long while playing.Some critiques, though:I dislike the racing vs AIs. It is difficult to describe, but it feels much less interactive than Wipeout despite having active powerups.  I don't feel that I'm actually racing against anything.  It is simply just another time trial with ghost cars instead of time benchmarks.Tangential to this, in the campain, there are several events that I don't care to play.  The maps and pods are so perfect that I just wanna run time trials and speed runs. Unfortunately, the campain has very few time trials and mostly features (what I would consider broken) races.  So I am forced to play the same few time trials to unlock all the other maps.Lastly, the campain releases new maps in layers that roughly correspond with your racing tier.  However, it is never smart to play these maps in the tier that debuts them because they are often very technical and requre practice in a lower speed tier.  I wish they had just released time trials of these maps in a lower speed tier first so you could work your way up while still earning campain credits.Other than these logistical issues, this game is near perfect.  Buy it and have fun!			",18,2,2,2,0,0,4

												I'm not too far along yet but I'm having a blast! I struggled the first day because I just could not understand how to steer my ship. It turns out that you have to use both sticks. There's a really helpful guide on the community for this game so make sure you give the user who posted it some props after giving it a read. It changed everything for my ability to stay on the track. I went from consistently placing last to almost always taking first or second. The game is really fast-paced and runs well on my somewhat dated rig.			",178,19,3,6,11,0,11

												Sci fi racer which doesn't resort to cheap tricks like 'blast your opponents with lasers'. You actually have to race. The gameplay and music screams 'F Zero and Wipeout had a kid'. I will buy any DLC they put out for this game. 34 clearly 'gets it'.tldr: OMG just buy it.			",372,86,14,52,47,5,39

												Wow factorFast. Really fast. With bright, imaginative visuals this game feels like what I imagine going into orbit duct-taped onto a rocket high on LSD must be.VR game?And I have not tried it with VR yet (a little scared of this experience, to be honest).Seriously - if you are like me, and skip over VR games - this is a complete product on its own. It is very pretty on a standard monitor, and performs very well in my case (gtx970, max settings).RacingOn top of its frantic momentum, it is a very satisfying racer, with a good variety of event-types. At times, the challenges require enough thought to earn a 'puzzle-game' tag, which adds to longevityControlsGamepad recommendedHow I enjoy itIt keeps me focused on the screen. It is very attention demanding, but has a very good flow, which ends up relaxing me. Great for 5 minutes, still great for 2 hours of intense racing. If you want to put everything around you on pause get immersed in something head to toe, go grab this.SharingGot my finacee (non-gamer) to try it. She does not know how to use a controller (and this game uses both analogue sticks), and still got into it improving lap to lap. Game does not hit you over the head with tutorials, but applies same basic as regular driving when it comes down to principles on taking corners etc. Plus, the speed and visuals make it attractive enough to keep trying to improve.PriceVery cheap for what it has to offer. I probably will be comming back to this every now and then, even after my initial infatuation wears off. For now - I'm still hooked.DownsidesA pretty shallow progression system, with no customization (same progression path for all vehicles) - not much of an RPG. varied tracks and events make up for it.

												First and foremost this game is a breath of fresh air in a very stagnant racing genre. If you are like me and loved the Fzero and Extreme G racing games of old then you'll love this. Don't expect some futuristic racing simulator. This game is all about speed and lots of it. You will need to have lighting fast reflexes though in order to get the best times due to the fast bends and the requirement to pitch and tilt your craft at the same time as steering in order to minmize damage and keep your speed up. Last thing to note there is the option to pruchase upgrades to your ships passive abilities and weapons along with the ability to purchase faster and stronger ships with money you win from races. Enjoy!			",78,0,10,6,0,0,9

												This game is intense. I have been playing it on the Vive. The sense of speed is immense and the aesthetic is gorgeous. The career mode is very good at getting you adjusted to the learning curve until eventually you're careening at full speed through the huge winding, curving maps flying by the seat of your pants. I actually have to take breaks from playing because of how much my hands hurt from strangling my controller during the insanely fast paced races. Taking a set of turns perfectly at full speed feels awesome and there is a very high skill ceiling.The variety of the ships is nice, and I love the low-poly simplistic visual style. The game features four tiers if racer from a good variety of ""companies"" and each ship can get rudamentary upgrades to each stat, with an upgrade system that allows you to fully flesh out any aspect that your ship is weak in.My only complaing with the game is that I'm getting a lot of artifacting on the vive. It doesn't occur on the 2d monitor version. But in certain fast paced areas like the parts where you're nose it pitchine down very quickly there is an annoying flickering. This may be a limitation of my hardware(4770k/Fury X), but turning down the graphics settings helped a decent bit. If you're a fan of this type of racing game(Similar to F-Zero and Whipeout), this game is for you. It truly is a worthy successor of the genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Based on the hour and a half I spent on this game, so far so good.The difficulty is off the charts (which is good, I did not expect the AI to give me a hard time on the first levels), the handling takes a bit of practice but is excellent, and the game is FAST !Keep in mind that the racing part is what made me buy it, there are also powerup races, but I found them to be more based on ship improvements rather than pure attacks.Recommended !

												Only recomended with caveats, it's worth a try if you like the genre. I refunded it as I just didn't enjoy it, but I don't think it deserves giving it a negative.I really wanted to like this and quickly persuaded myself to buy it. However, Wipeout HD Fury is agame I played the crap out of, and hence is the yardstick. Redout controls very well and I appreaciate the skill ceiling; it's not hard to get into the flow of things, even though the slowest ships are much faster than Wipeout's. I didn't play enough to explore all the tracks admittedly, and it's good there are differences to Wipeout in the control, but I'm finding myself really missing the other modes and setting up jumps with your pitch, barrel rolling everywhere to chain up the boosts and clearing massive sections of track. To be completely honest I'd prefer to play HD Fury again. Redout looks far more up to date graphically, but having gone back to see videos of HD Fury, the backdrops are better and it doesn't look THAT that much worse considering how intensive Redout seems to be. My 660 is getting long in the tooth, but I had to drop down to 1600x900 windowed to get sold 60fps with most things on normal and epic view dist. I've seen sub 40fps hits in places. It doesn't look that perceptively worse at lower settings which is good.Unfortunately, to me Wipeout HD Fury is simply a more complete game, which I hope is a point that Redout can reach eventually.Some other minor negatives are the lack of resolution options in the game, it has custom resolutions, windowed and borderless available in the config files only. More detail on what the graphics settings actually do could be useful, eg. for post, High and Epic appear to add depth of field and ambient occulsion respectively. As it's a game you need a controller this is being VERY picky, but mouse control in the menus would be nice. The music is fine but not as good as Wipeout's always was.			",29,3,2,4,4,0,6

												Iused to be an Avid Wipeout player and I've since then been looking for a replacement, I've finally found it.If you have ever liked AG racing games, you should buy this, you have to have  this in your library.The game feels amazing, The sense of speed is insane, The Graphics look beautiful. The tracks ingenious and with lots of variations (Some a re just straight up crazy). The Music fits the game perfectly. And there's more content to come.A must have for any AG racing fan.

												Simply the best AG (anti-gravity) racer in years. Lying somewhere between F-Zero and Wipeout (though much more toward the latter), Redout offers the best of both worlds in terms of gratifying speed and a challenging handling model, rewarding track knowledge and experience with the way the player's chosen craft handles. The online mode is very solid. There are some balance issues that need to be ironed out, but nothing game-breaking, and the single player campaign offers hours and hours of content.The game isn't perfect, of course: many users are reporting bad performance on some cards, especially those with under 4GB of VRAM, and the lack of difficulty settings can be offputting to newbies (though, as a relatively experienced AG racer, I find the AI to be just about perfect, if a little on the easy side). One thing that does annoy me is the inability to turn off motion blur (I'm usually a fan of motion blur, but it can get a little overwhelming at times).If you're on the fence, I can't recommend this game enough. If you've got a reasonably powerful computer, it should run like a dream, and will likely be the most fun you've had in years with an AG racer.			",367,68,10,25,15,0,22

												Brilliant arcade racing which will bring back memories of the golden age of arcade rocket sled racing - i.e. Wipeout 2097 + F-Zero.  Amazing sensation of speed, yet logical and intuitive controls that will have you skidding around corners and activating turbo up to harrowing speeds (a believable 1300 kph I've clocked so far).  When you have that whole sitting on the edge of your seat tension for the bulk of a multitrack race ... and when you nail the other guys by microseconds... there will be wooting.  On a great graphics card, its gorgeous, and I can only imagine how whiteknuckling it would get in VR.Developers please note - this game desperately needs replay options to witness your glorious achievements from external views... sincere wish for a future patch (and they patch generously).  Would purchase additional tracks and tournaments for DLC.  Thoroughly recommended.			",30,3,3,9,2,0,1

												Outside of F-Zero I have never played the games Redout was inspired from. The thing is, you don't need to. This game is amazing all on its own. Difficult but fair, and fast as all hell. Perhaps one of the fastest racing games I have ever played. The minimalist anesthetic works perfectly and some of the tracks really are works of art. A few minor glitches but the devs seem to be working on that. Solid 9 out of 10. Worth every penny. Fun to play on massive amounts of caffine.			",885,39,26,56,46,1,87

												The tagline mentions the game is compared to F-Zero, WipeOut, Rollcage, and POD. Let's not forget about this classic as well. Midway's arcade game Hyperdrive @ http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=13083. This game was worth the buy. The gameplay and soundtrack is really awesome. Somehow I am also reminded of this racing anime movie as well @
