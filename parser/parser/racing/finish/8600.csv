												I am talking about this game after playing GTR 2.As for this game, this game is very well developed, the car handles perfect and the tweaking system of the cars is even more beneficial than ever before(previous updates)The number of cars in the game is few but we cannot easily forget the modding scene regarding this game. As for me, a friend of mine gifted this game to me. I got the extreme edition including RACE 07 DLC, RACE 07 and GTR Evolution. Due to all the three contents, the selection of cars and tracks increased a lot. Addition of Nurburgring(Track) via GTR Evolution was must since every racing game is considered incomplete due to it's absense.As for the ingame physics, the game is far better than Need For Speed franchise which emphasizes on ultra quality graphics and High end cars rather than ingame physics. Cars handles and feels realistic and the engine sounds are very similar to the ones in real life.Because this is an old game, the multiplayer lobby mostly remains empty but if you are lucky, you will find a server with 15-14 players. Don't hesitate to buy it, the amount of ingame content is anormous and the modding community is still growing at an amazing rate. Cars, tracks feels lively.Buy this game and if you own any steering wheel controller for pc, it will act as chocolate syrup over the existing cake.Go on, buy it   :DThank you all for reading, and thanks to my friend for gifting me this :D			",89,12,5,8,9,0,11

												It absolutely does not metter because this game is released 2007 i give it 20/10 ( lol ) why ?It's a simulationIt's one of the best simulation i have played so farEverithing feels right when i play itIt's good optimized ( sure it's old engine of the graphic ""dx9"" but still avesome )Never got any lags or problemsAI drives like humans do , fast , agressive but they doing mistakes to , it's nice to see when they spin out of a track the same way and for the same reason like you can spin out = BalancedThere are so much Racing Track's and Cars to select and  race them , but the best is , you can find on several websites Fan made customized tracks and cars for free , most of them look's much better than the original game tracks / cars.It's compatible with a lot tipes of steering wheel and with a nice settup , full enjoyable with a Xbox 360 Gamepad.RecommendedIf you like a simulation , and you don't care so much about a ""new un-optimized graphic engine like they have nowday's , where you constantly crash becouse the game is not optimized good and you get a micro lag by driving on 300 km / h "" then this game is definatelly worth the cheap price to have it in your collection.I Definatelly Recommended.

												By itself the game is fun once you learn the car handling, but the online community is extremely hostile to you and anyone new to the game. You're new and don't quiet know how to handle it yet? Kick or Ban. You learn it and drive properly, not even being an crashing♥♥♥♥♥ Kick or ban just because ""free key"". You wanna spectate the people better than you? NOOO!! Not to mention everyone just quits mid-races and it doesn't matter if they are in the first places or the last places, they just do it even if theres still 5 laps to go. Additionally, you can't join Games that are in progress of a Race so you end up racing against no one or your buddy given that quitting behavior.			",516,165,16,48,30,5,69

												I've played for years and it is absolutely the best racing simulation out there. Well optimized, I've never suffered any stutter or lag whatsoever. Graphics may not be absolutely cutting edge by todays standards, but there is certainly not anything lacking in the visual department. ( The actual game looks much better than the promo videos, believe me ) I do find that user made skins available at mod sites generally look superior to the stock car skins. Cars have excellent physics and feel, controller set-up is easily customized to suit your style of controller and play, car setups can be finely tuned with many many variables which accurately mirror real-world tuneability. Alternately, pre-configured set-ups are available online. There are a huge number of different cars and tracks to suit any skill level or particular interest, Everything from high-downforce open-wheel racing, to touring cars, minis, etc etc. I prefer the vintage sports cars myself, the Retro pack with GT Legends mod brings me back to the golden years of vintage sports car racing. The modding community is still very active, there are too many user made cars, tracks, skins, and effects mods to list, which add a lot to the game, and are not very difficult to install and run.In summary, if you are a racing enthusiast and you don't have this game, you are really missing the boat. Don't expect any ""yo dude, that was so gnarly"" as in, say, DIRT2. What you are getting here is pure racing, and nothing but. At this price, you're stealing it. So get it, and drive it like you stole it.Is it easy? No. Are you going to jump right into the most powerful car and dominate the competition? No. This is not an arcade game, it's a simulation. There is a learning curve. You may learn that you actually suck, at first anyways. Ever watch racing on television and think; ""hey I could do that no problem""? Here's your chance. Think you're fast? Find out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Race’07 is simply a must to any real sim racer’s library. It is quite simply the best touring car experience out there. I've put hundreds of hours into this sim, most of which doing competitive league and championship racing at Race2Play.com. The features and details this sim has to offer, especially at the time of its release, were second to none. Comprehensive tire model, very rich setup with (most) cars responding very well to the setup changes, best FWD touring car or similar experience to date, windscreen and visor bug splats/mud with helmets having tear-offs, lots of good add-ons (particularly Retro Expansion!) which gave a variety of cars and more tracks such as the entire Green Hell and a barrage of GT1 - GT3 content with the GTREvo expansion.The GT car physics are sub-par, I'll be honest. GTR2 was much better for these and GTRE fails to exploit the same GT experience. The formula cars are kind of a hit and miss. You really need to dive into the setup to get these feeling correctly, but the FMaster and FRR are really fun when you do. Unfortunately the Formula cars in this game use GT car brakes! Grand Prix length events with the FRR, even with full brake duct and lower pressure, will overheat and destroy the brakes. Because they overheat at 600C like the GT brakes, instead of overheating at the F1 range of 1000C, which they can easily reach with higher ambient temperature and heavy brake-load circuits. Unfortunately having my brakes fail in two Grands Prix cost me a very prestigious drivers championship at R2P so I remain bitter about that flaw.But all-in-all the setup depth and complexity and telemetry coming off the car, the amount of cars and the detail put into the individual physics for each (even model-by-model in classes!) is amazing, the detail of the tracks including the bumps and undulations of the surface make driving a F1 or GT1 car on the edge in league racing incredibly intense, and just.. yeah. It's a sim, not an arcade game. If you take the time to learn how to setup each car, push yourself to be consistent and drive it like a sim - drive it like you would a real car - setup your FFB to really feel the front suspension weight transfers this is a driving sim experience like no other!

												Make sure you at least have a controller that can be plugged in to your computer. Otherwise you're going to have a bad time accelerating, braking, and turning.Like the game says you're going to have to accelerate/brake lightly majority of the time, and you can't do that with a keyboard. If this was an arcade racing game, it would be different.Game: ""Dude, you have to do stuff with finess. Here's your chance, turn left lightly.""Keyboard: ""LEFT!""			",160,18,7,16,17,1,23

												My first impressions of Race 07 when I picked it up was that it would be a cheap little sim that I wouldn't put much time into, 60+ hours later and I belive it is safe to say that this has become my go to racing game, the game offers a large mixture of closed and open wheeled cars and that's before you get into the modding community for it. The modding community is still active and mods are still being pushed out any, and I mean any, racing series or track you can think of can more than likely be found either through offical dlc, which is pretty good, or mods.I would reccomend this sim to any racing game fan no matter what level of experince or preference to series as, like I said, you can find anything you want through mods or dlc.

												To be clear from the start Race 07 is a simulation game. That means to play it, it is recommended to have a gamepad or wheel. Trying to do anything without one of those is a waste of time.To start off with there are lots of annoying things, the control setup is tedious (but it works), the settings are sometimes overly complicated, people online can be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(if I had a cent for every first corner accident...) and the AI opponents are mentally challenged.However once you've set up everything correctly and connect to a multiplayer server (preferably with some friends) the game is great. For people who like 'real' racing the gameplay is great. Cars handle like they should and once you know what you're doing close racing is very much possible.Also because of the driving aids people with different skill levels can easily compete with each other for fun racing sessions.From there on there is a myriad of tweaks and settings to change to get that extra bit of speed out of your car, I am not interested in that but for the simracing enthusiast it is great.To conclude, there are some small issues with Race 07 but on the whole it is the best sim racing game available on Steam, period.

												Shortly after getting off of GTR 2 FIA GT Racing Game (wrote a review for it), this was the next game I attempted at, and by god this one is much better!As I continued my urge to play some racing games, this one was next on the list of downloaded games. Coming right from GTR 2, this game is the exact same, but vastly upgraded and runs so much better. As I had previously stated in my last review, there was major graphical issues with it that straight up broke the game. This one I was able to go max settings and still run at 120 FPS smoothly. The menus were much easier to navigate as well. It only took me about 20 min to set up all my settings were the last one took an hour. The 1 music track is boring and turned off the music instantly.I got in and did a few races and had a blast. I only experienced a few crashes trying to select a few cars, but otherwise no problems. One big thing that I strongly agree with is that this game supports mods! After finding a guide with links, I was able to add in 30+ cars and 70+ more tracks into the game!This is a game that I plan on keeping on my PC for when I have more urges for a racing game. Strongly recommend if you like Racing Simulators!			",997,303,41,103,76,9,150

 High Quality Racing at a Low Price  Race 07 is an absolutely amazing racing simulator, for a cheap price too. Though this game was released in late 2007, It is still very relevant and challenges many new games that are released. I have not a single complaint about this game. I would even call it one of the best racing simulators on PC when all of the expansion packs are installed.  I actually received this game as well as the GTR Evolution Expansion as part of a Steam key giveaway a while back, but I can tell you that I would gladly pay double the price of the game because it is so good. I enjoyed it so much that I recently purchased the Mega Bundle that contains all of the expansion packs, which I definitely recommend you buy. I've already had hours of fun with this game, and I can assure many more are to come.The physics are great, the AI is pretty decent, and I can't complain about the graphics. With a wheel, this game is even more realistic. There are dozens of preset controls for multiple wheels, including the G27 which I have been playing the game with. If you get bored of Single Player mode, there is always a multiplayer mode, which is still quite active for an older game. The drivers are sometimes sub-par, but you really get that in any online experience. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a bit of fun. It has a cheap price, so there really isn't any reason to not buy it. I give it a 9/10.			",32,2,27,3,17,0,1

												10 years later and still one of the top sims out there. You can get tons of cars and tracks along with the included in the sim. The best part is that you dont have to pay monthly fees, pay for cars or tracks, an so on. The ""newer"" sims like AC or RF2 just suck up your money and require a powerful computer. Race 07 works on almost any computer, is cheap (just pay once and enjoy), and is a great sim, download many many many content for free, absolutely GREAT and reliable multiplayer, etc... and for me it is better than those ""newer"" games.

												I literally have zero cons for this game. Get the game + all expansions, its one of those lifetime games, where you could play it in 10 years and still enjoy it. Easily top 3 actual racing games (I mean racing, with pits and 20 laps with a realistic full grid of cars and an actual season, with whatever tracks you want, using any car catagory) on PC and probably top 3 racing games of all time for me. As much as i love the graphics of GRID and GT and FORZA, this game I can race 20+ laps and have pits and feel like im in an actual race. Bumper to bumper and fighting for every corner, provided you put teh Ai high enough for your personal skill level. I'm not a bad racer and 95% Ai gives me a very solid hardcore sweat filled competitive race with asteering wheel. Whereas most racing games GRID etc, you have 1 race, have some fun, but theres really nothing else to it. There's no intense championship seasons in most of those games, accept Codemasters F1 and perhaps DIRT RALLY. Race 07 is like a slightly more realistic version of TOCA 3. With mods and V8 Supercar and DTM mods you can download from around the web , plus tons of other mods and a brutal Ai if you stick the Ai on 90% or higher, its endless intense racing , doesnt matter how old it is now.

												I used to play GTR2, then I tried this as it is the secuel of the previous, it didn't attract me at the begining, but then I purchased the expansion: GTR evolution, I strongly recomend you to try if you are looking for racing simulator.Diferences between GTR 2 and RACE 07: in GTR 2 the car seems more light, more difficult to control, the game charges much faster even if not optimized for parallel computing. RACE 07 is a bit more easy to handle, making it more accessible to everyone, the graphics would say are a bit better, not big difference, just fine for a racing simulator. This are the main differences, the rest is the same, a great Simbin creation.			",4,1,12,1,0,0,7

												NOTE: This review includes notes on expansions aswell.With 800+ Hours played, I think it's safe to say that this game and it's expansions is one that will last the test of time.It may not have the following of other racing simulators like rFactor or iRacing, but this is easily up there with some/all of the best.It has a great racing community if you find a relaxed group of racers (RaceDepartment are great for clean racing and no lock-in racing series). The choice of cars across all the expansions is perfect for online racing. There really is something for everyone, from slow and nimble Mini Coopers, to high powered open wheel racers, to classic and modern muscle cars (Race On expansion).My favorite part of this game though is it's single player section though. It's ability to play and create championships makes this a great single player game, along with the fact that the AI is actually rather smart to race against compared to other games.Modding is also fairly popular with this game as is evident by sites like NoGripRacing and RaceDepartment, with various add-on cars and tracks all waiting to be played.Since this is a racing simulation, it is definitely a greater experience to use a wheel. I highly recommend getting yourself a wheel if you don't have one yet as it will change your experience entirely.If you don't play racing games that often it's more than acceptable to use a gamepad, it's still good fun but not as good as with a wheel. The game is drivable with a keyboard as well, but that's a last resort.In short, it's definitely worth getting the whole package: Race Injection, GTR Evo and Race On. It's perfect to me...For games as a whole, it's easily 8/10.For racing sims, it's 9/10.			",65,8,17,3,14,0,9

												It's not the sound or the visuals that set this game apart from the rest. Name one game on the market that allows you to actually use Pit Strategy, Tire Wear, Fuel Consumption, and take into accout car damage while you race? There isn't one. There is no game that allows you to customize your race with so many options and also include your friends in those custom races. After racing for so long you forget the visuals and the first impressions. All you want is a game that plays well and has the options, cars, tracks and longevity you want in a game.

Race 07 is probably one of the best racing sims on the market for the money.If you're looking for a realistic racing experience, look no further. I managed to pick this game up and all of its DLC for about a buck each during a humble bundle, and I have loved this game ever since. Although it may not have the aesthetics of modern racing sims, the graphics hold up incredibly well, and can easily be optimized for any system. The many different cars in Race 07 feel completely different from one another, and handle much like you would expect them to. Open wheel F1 style cars can corner with ease, assuming you can control the massive amount of power they contain, while heavy muscle cars provide an interesting challenge in the bends. The controls can be fine tuned to your liking, whether you own a wheel or a gamepad or just have a keyboard and mouse. For only $3.99 (at the time I'm writing this) you'd be crazy not to buy this game if your a fan of motorsports. Just remember, your not buying a crazy, over the top game like Need for Speed or Burnout, your buying a game with a pure focus on racing.			",93,4,29,11,30,0,8

												I own Project Cars, Assetto Corsa, Stock car Xtreme, Dirt 3 and now Race07.How does it compare......its brilliant, next to assetto corsa & project cars the best racer among the above games....why?...cos feels like you are driving a car, there are loads of options, frame rate is great, graphics are excellent, loads of cars and competitions, supports G27 wheel with no issues and its cheap! On top of this its great fun, AI seems to be intelligent and gives you a great race, you can modify the AI strength too or use set defaults like easy, pro etc. I bought the bundle including retro racing pack , the old minis are awesome!

Race 07Is Race 07 a good game?Before we get into whether or not this game is good or not, I should start off by saying this game is quite old. Meaning this game is quite outdated and the only things that will be fixed or updated are possible bugs that may arise.While this game is impressively old, it also manages to be one of the better racing sims you can buy for the price of chips at Walmart. Seriously, this game is dirt cheap. This game is so cheap it makes a ring out of macaroni and cheese for a marriage proposal. The advantage of it having a low price gives it quite the advantage in the value for money department.The graphics may not be the best but the gamplay is almost second to none. While the multiplayer aspect is almost dead, there are a few servers that live even in the abandoned town that is Race 07. One being 100Mbit; 100Mbit is a server I've raced on for a year now and I've had a lot of great times racing on the server. Races have been won and lost and battles have been sparked no matter how dense or empty the grid may be. You can't just jump straight into 100Mbit though, you need to get some practice in the singleplayer and learn to be cautious and friendly to other drivers. Not to mentioing giving them enough room to race instead of simply running them off the road. Once this is done, let the fun of being in a competition begin.There is still much to enjoy about this game even without the multiplayer, as there are quite a lot of track mods you can download and have a go with. Such as some Mario 64 race tracks to have a go racing around.There are other games that I think to be the spirtual successor to this game, games such as Automobilista and Asseto Corsa. However, if you want a game that is cheaper than a brand name pillow from JC Penny's.....This is your game. ",16,2,16,2,3,0,0

												The 'Race' series comes from a little Swedish company called Simbin, not the most evocotive name. But when you take the entire series as a whole, they have created an absolute master piece of PC gaming.Race 07, the core game of the series, is primarily focused on the WTCC (World Touring Car Championsip) for 2007, along with serveral 'support' series you can race also. Having learnt leassons from previous racing sims, Simbin have just kept adding to the game, & despite the final collection numbering near double figures, the game is still stable, reliable & entertaining as day one.The one thing that should grab the attention of serious racing-sim fans is the fact that behind the less glamourous series' is in fact nothing less than a licensed version of the rFactor engine, a sim that has gone beyond being a game, it is tool that is even used by top racing teams to train professional drivers!Once you have the full works of the Race series, you can race everything from Caterhams, MINI Coopers, WTCC cars of various series, Formula BMW, GT cars, muscle cars... The number of different cars on offer is quite astounding.However, the real bonus to the Race series is that Simbin have left the game entirely open to being heavily modded, & in fact, have made allowances for making the game easy to mod, from car skins, to tracks, graphics tweaks to entirely new cars that have never existed in the game. Despite having added a huge number of mods of various types to my install, the game remains stable & utterly reliable, something that could quite easily be the make or break of a modding favourite.On the downside, you pretty much need the whole hog to ensure mods will work, meaning you do have to commit to it. Also, given the quality of the 'sim' part, if you don't have, or never intend to, get a steering wheel, don't bother with it, you'll just be wasting the game & not getting the full experience.It adds up to a game where you can race almost anything you want to, on pretty much any track you like. There are even online racing clubs who use the game.I've reached a point where I actually wouldn't even consider buying new racing sims as Race has everything I need, with all the quality & realism of a truly great game that could only be this great on a PC.

												The same goes for GTR Evolution and RACE 07.This game is eternal. A true masterpiece. 7 years after its release this classical car racing simulation is not obsolete and will never be.GTR Evolution / Race 07 has it all: decent graphics, awesome physics, solid AI and huge content. The game – no, the simulation – is highly customizable. It can thus appeal to both beginners and hardcore simracers.During Steam Sales, this game is simply the best value for money of the entire racing sim universe.What do I need to play a car sim ?Racing wheel is not mandatory. But a game pad is a must. X360 controller works fine.Wait ! 7 years old and counting ? How about online ?The online community is tiny but robust. Anyway brand new sims will soon suffer the same situation.Add-on content ?There are a lot of add-on contents developed by the community. Especially tracks. But generally no setup is provided for the different car types. And it takes skill and time to create a good setup. But fear not ! Even if you stick to the vanilla game, you can enjoy hundreds hours of play thanks to so many tracks and car models.Yet I want add-ons ! Free add-ons !Simbin has released two free DLCs:Formula Raceroom (Formula 1)Andy Priaulx Crown Plaza Raceway (track) ",97,7,7,20,8,2,18
