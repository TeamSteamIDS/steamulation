								Good start on a VR implementation of kart racing, similar to a famous plumber-themed game. There is a fair amount of camera motion so it's not for folks with weak stomachs (Blaze Rush is a better VR alternative for those players).Performance was good on a gaming laptop with Nvidia GTX 765M with a DK2 in extended mode so it should be fine on any decent VR rig. The UI is done nicely in a VR mode.Looking forward to seeing how the game develops. My only suggestion for improvement is that the scale of the player hands and steering wheel feel a bit large.

								Good start, works with Oculus perfectly (especially happy with direct mode instead of using extended desktop mode), but game itself is very minimal. It is more like technical demo than game and there is free VR Karts demo available too. Here are very minimal improvements compared to that free demo, therefore as of today I cannot recommend paying for that (unless if you want to just support developers). Looking forward for much more content, it has potential to be the best ""real game"" for Oculus. Idea itself is working very well. I'm going to change my ""not recommended"" to ""recommended"" when there will be more content- different maps, different music, possibility to save, some progressive game mode, multiplayer... right now its all missing.Update: changing my recommendation to thumb up as I see lots of improvements here.

								This game is simple, but it works with the newest drivers Oculus drivers (0.8.0), so it is something.			",443,81,14,26,61,13,13

								I don't know what game all those negative reviewers were playing, but this game is amazing. It feels like a VR Mario kart. The only thing I think I'd change would be to add difficulty levels for the Ai karts as I found it a little too easy.			",234,45,4,25,12,3,26

								Super smooth even on older hardware (gtx 650 ti).  Good driving feel.  However, the tracks all feel WAY too similar....all castle themed with only two very similar sounding songs.  Racing the same track over and over in the free demo feels no different than the retail version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Love the idea, but there is not much content as it is. There needs to be more maps and more map types. More than that though, the maps need to be more unique and crazy, I would wait until a little more content is released.			",290,53,14,41,56,3,46
