												Fun Game.Visuals are great.Tracks are fun to ride.Shooting is fun but could use a bit of work. It seems the projectiles do not inherit player velocity, which makes all the shots seem to be fired way behind they are actually being shot. Makes the visuals look weird and it seems harder to hit enemies. There also is no usable gun sights. 7/10 as is, but with some tweaks it could be even better. In its current state the game is totally worth it.			",345,39,16,18,47,7,29

												*Edit-  They listened to the criticism about the shooting and the latest update is a big improvement in my book.  The game feels great now!  So I'll leave my original review for context,  but know that I can wholeheartedly recommend this game even more than before.  *Original review- This is a good game,  but it could be a great one if the problem of the shots coming from so far behind you is fixed.  It really kills a lot of the fun to be shooting at everything and bullets are flying from 20' behind you.  It makes it feel like you can't really aim at anything,  almost like you're pointing at stuff that someone else is shooting at.  That said,  it's still a thumbs up for being an excellent rollercoaster VR with a high level of polish and content for the price. It didn't make me sick and I giggled like a schoolgirl on a rollercoaster with guns.			",405,111,15,61,39,5,36

												Finally we have a decent roller coaster game for the Vive!I don't know why it took so long, roller coaster shooters were everywhere on the Cardboard market...The visuals are great, didn't get too motion sick until I'd gone all the way through the first track, and that's for someone experienced with the Vive.I highly suggest you change the firing mechanic from a bullet-based shot to a constant laser beam. I have no interest in leading targets. There should also be a peaceful mode if I just want to go for a ride. Also I think the enemy attacks are too chaotic, I'd like to have an easier time grasping their attack visuals. Maybe if there were just enemies in the form of traps, like lasers crossing the track you have to disable the emitters for, the game would be pretty perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow this game is pretty fantastic. Def one of the better VR games I've tried.Your player moves pretty fast along a rail as you shoot enemies out of the sky, like a roller coaster. Intense! Really like the music. The bullets lag behind the player a bit so sometimes it's hard to tell you are firing and where you are aiming, but the hit detections is pretty generous. Graphics and effects look really nice. Decent amount of content, 2 worlds with 5 tracks each.Lots of fun, very much worth the low price.			",346,67,12,30,50,8,20

												This game has such a neat concept.  You're basically combining a ""rail shooter"" with literal rails (in the form of a roller coaster track).  Unfortunately the execution of the concept isn't as good.It boils down to this: the ""coaster"" is moving so fast and yet the game is lagged behind so it never seems like you're shooting where you're aiming. The game hints that you'll need to aim ahead, but to me it seems like you need to aim EARLY as well as ahead.  Maybe if I turn the graphics down somehow it'll work better.  Nothing in the game looks so intense that it would stress out the GTX 1080 SC I have though.  It's also not like the framerate is bad in game.  It's just that my shots seem lagged by about 100-120ms or so.The weirdness of this effect is that I can fire a shot, and because I'm moving forward and the track is going downward, I'll see the shot fly from slightly behind me and above me even though my gun is by my waist.  I tried repositioning the controllers in several ways to see if it was some weirdness from the way it was being tracked but it didn't seem to matter.  Shots to the side didn't seem to be lagged as bad.  Only shooting directly in front.Things I liked:  Rollercoasters and guns, sounds like a good time.  The main menu graphics look nice  There's an exit option that actually exits the game instead of having to hit the steam button and exit from there like a bunch of other games.  The scenery changes from day to night as you go through the various laps.  For the most part, the coasters are exciting enough to feel like a ride, and mild enough that you aren't horking up your intestines.Things I didn't like:  The apparent lag in the shots.  Your shots are all projectiles instead of beams or hitscan so aiming them is annoying.  The enemy is rather uninspired.  most of them are just jagged blobs of whatever.  Only one or two enemies struck me as cool.  Half the time you can't even tell what the hell hit you.   Because of the lag, hitting the ""health"" pickups is made extra difficult though it seemed worse on later levels than the first level (maybe because there are fewer health pickups)  After you finish your 3rd lap and ""win"" it makes you take a victory lap around the track and really, 3 laps is plenty, thank you.    The music isn't very memorable.  This is another game where immediately after quitting the game I can't even remember what the songs sounded like. I love the concept of the game, I just don't like the execution.  Also the game store page says ""10 tracks"" but 2 of those tracks are marked ""Free ride"" so really there's only 8 levels.I feel like this game needs a bit more polish on the enemies and some of the game mechanics to be more fun. Most people would probably say ""Eh, it's only $5, so who cares?"" but I'm not likely to get 5 hours of gameplay out of this (because it's not that much fun).  I'm not going to refund it, but I wouldn't recommend it either.  OR if you're going to buy it, at least you know what you're in for.			",844,225,54,90,158,17,114

												Without proper shooting, this game is not worth your money. I'm not going to ask for a refund because I have hopes the dev will fix the issue. The roller coaster is funny, but without shooting it simply makes no sense.That's too bad, because it would be a reaaallly cool game with a proper shooting. I am really hoping an update will be released with the fix.  ",24,11,0,2,8,1,1

												Fun, polished and challenging (at least the 4 most difficult levels). Well worth the asking price. The guns feels a bit weird, they are not shooting but aiming rockets, witch adds to the challange. I was bummed out at first there doesn't seem to be any scoring system to compete for highscores, but the later levels is difficult enough that it still will last me a while. No motion sickness after about 40 min of play. I don't have an iron stomach, but seldom get motion sickness anymore.			",260,94,11,5,33,2,13

												This game is sensory overload, and I like that sort of thing. There's so much going on that you can barely keep track. The shooting mechanics need work because you don't really feel like you're aiming reliably. Rather, it feels like you're spamming bullets in the hopes that it will hit something. It needs better accuracy. It's worth the current 4.99 price though.			",283,61,7,6,28,4,7

												Quite a cool game.. visuals and sound are polished and action is intense. Obviously it could make you mation sick but the sensetive players will know it anyway.I dont think i will play it for hours but for 5€ its absolutly fine! Espescially when youre tired of standing in the room and still want to keep on shooting :)So all in all i would say you totally get what you expect: quick and fun action			",50,20,0,0,11,3,1

												The game is worth 5 dollars just to ride around the tracks which look sharp. However its more of an experience than a game right now. I say this because the aiming needs to be fixed. You can just flail the controllers around and blindly squeeze the triggers and hit as much as if you were aiming. Feels pointless. Hard to tell what are targets, would be nice if there were points or something to designate hitting a target. So fun experience riding the tracks, smooth and well worth 5 bucks. The shooting reallly needs a lot of work.			",78,24,1,17,13,2,1
