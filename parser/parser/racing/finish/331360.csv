								Don't think about it, just give this game a chance. It's free, if you don't like it, just uninstall it.This game is one of the coolest most interesting concepts for a game I've seen in the past decade.I'm not going to compare this game to a MOBA or Twisted metal which is what every single review of this game does, instead I'm going to describe it all on it's own.Heavy Metal Machines is a 4vs4 team based Battle Racing game. There is one simple objective, capture the bomb from the center of the map, and deliver it to the enemy's base, but it's not as simple as it sounds. Each team has their own race track on their side of the map that the enemy team has to transport the bomb through and your job is to stop them from getting there, intercept the bomb from them, and turn around to race it to their side of the map. With a plentyful roster of drivers with their own unique vehicles to choose from, you build a team of 4 with each player trying to fill one of 3 roles, Transporter, Interceptor, and Support.The Transporter's skill set revolves around mobility and keeping posession of the bomb while ""transporting"" it to the enemy base.As an Interceptor, you will be dealing damage to the enemy team's vehicles in an attempt to protect your bomb carrier, as well as taking theirs out.And last but not least, The Support class is very important, you'll be shielding, healing, and dishing out crowd control to make sure your team delivers the bomb without a hitch, it's an invaluable role as well as a very satisfying and fun role to play.Imagine a scene from Fast and Furious or Mad Max where a convoy of vehicles is battling it out for control of a precious cargo, that's what this game feels like, and it is just as awesome as it sounds.Give this game a shot, you won't regret it.

								Today I got banned from a forum for 2 weeks so decided to find a new game to play.  Didn't know what to expect with this one, but it's free to play, open beta, so I decided to give it a shot.  Played almost 2 hours non-stop before my hand cramped up from having a death grip on the mouse. Trying to match with others online took too long, but I did make the attempt when most people were at work or school.Played with bots instead, became a big fan of Larry Givens.Announcer is very excited about his job.Game doesn't take up much space, it's quick to load, and a lot of fun.10/10 would get banned from that forum and throw myself into lava again.

								Awsome game but don't compare it to League of Legends  because in this game you don't have to farm a lane or care about your mana.. only thing you do is go for the objective watch your hp and cooldowns and have fun! This is a non-stop action game with cars like Twisted Metal. I'd say the only thing that is similar to LoL is that you got one unit to control with a top view and you aim for your skills shots! Fun Fact : -Everything in the game can be unlocked with the game currency even the skins ! -One of the only f2p game that deserve to be played there is no Pay-2-Win!			",84,1,4,5,14,1,0

								If you can't find a match on North American servers, try queing on the European servers.A very fun game, but has a lacking player base currently. If you're a fan of the gameplay in older games like Rock n' Roll Racing or Death Rally, or like the style and over the top vehicles from Twisted Metal or Mad Max, then I think you should give the game a chance. Or, if you enjoy MOBAs, then you may find that Heavy Metal Machines is a breath of fresh air for the genre, its something incredibly different compared to most MOBAs. Very rarely does a good game in this style appear, but I think that Heavy Metal Machine has a lot of potential.			",224,41,14,30,17,2,31

Came into the game hoping for a newer Twsited Metal type, what it plays like is more akin to Twisted Rugby to me.

								Heavy Metal Machines, MOBA meets racing. You chose your driver and battle against other players to deliver the bomb to the enemy teams base. Each driver has there own set of abilities that can be used in combat, to help your team or punish your enemies. Right now Heavy Metal Machines is in early access, so it does not have all the kinks worked out. That being said I felt the game was a higher than expected quality while I was playing it and I recommend anyone interested try it out as soon as they can. 1/31/17			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

								I DL'd this game because at first glance it reminded me of the old Blizzard title Rock n' Roll Racing, and I'm glad I did.  What a cool game to play for free.  It does look and sound like the old Rock n' Roll Racing, but Heavy Metal Machines puts it's own spin on the formula.  What they have created is super competative, capture-the-flag style car combat, and it's really fun.  Cool vehicles with unique abilities designed for competative team play.  Choose from a range of play styles.  Deal damage, be a tank, or a support class.  Level up your vehicle's abilities, and stats to become super powerful.  Dominate and jam out at the same time.  This is an easy recommendation.			",19,0,1,0,1,0,5

Early Access Review
								Heavy Metal Machines Open Beta Review!The beautifully stylized, adrenaline packed world of Heavy Metal Machines (HMM) reinvigorates the Automotive Battle Arena genre. The beta took me back to the hay day of the Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 franchises while older players will recall Rock n’ Roll racing and Combat Cars as more direct sources of inspiration for HMM. Veteran developer, Hoplon Infotainment, may be better known in Latin America having released games like Taikodom and Apocalypse: Party's Over from its offices in the incredibly beautiful Florianópolis, Brazil. HMM is intended to be a global affair with servers located in North America, South America, Europe, and most recently Asia. I expect this title to develop a robust competitive scene of 4 vs. 4 bomb delivery action (more on that below) as players in the beta are already quite competitive and are chatting away in the Heavy Metal Machines forums.The ArtI don’t usually start with the art work in a game but it's impossible to ignore the cohesive, hyper stylized world inside the walls of Metal City. The artwork is a wicked fusion of Mad Max and Darkest Dungeon tones blended with a darker version of the DC Comic's color pallet. The game has a ominous appeal to it, but not in a depressing way. Metal City is gloomy and damp, anchored by blues and purples but is splashed with the bright yellows and reds of lava and fire.While we will discuss the characters more below they are heavily stylized in their appearance which is consistently complimented by the machines they drive, abilities they use, and music they rock out too.The art work alone could sell Heavy Metal Machines for many gamers and is sure to catch people’s attention like it did on the floor of Twitch Con 2016 which I where I met the Hoplon road team.Game PlayElegant simplicity of objective and control scheme make this title easy to pick up while skill shot based abilities and fast moving vehicle action make it hard to master, exactly what you want in a competitive team game. While you can play with a controller, I haven’t tried it yet, so I can only discuss the mouse and key board controls. Holding down Left Mouse Button accelerates the car forward, Right Mouse Button flips the car around to drive in reverse, Q and W pop your basic abilities, R pops your character’s ultimate ability, and E gives you a burst of speed. Most (if not all) of the abilities have fairly standard cooldown mechanics that any MOBA or MMO player will be familiar with. Your ultimate must be charged up by dealing out damage or healing your friends so creating chaos for the opponent is reward by allowing you to create more chaos! Nice!The core game mode is a 4 vs. 4 bomb grab and delivery arena. A bomb spawns in the center of the map and teams charge into battle, grab the bomb, and attempt to drive it to their opponent's spawn location. You are free to drive almost anywhere on the large, symmetric map unless you are carrying the bomb which forces you to follow a longer, winding path. Tight turns, pools of lava, and zones that will knock the bomb out of your possession demand skilled driving. The other players are unencumbered by the bomb allowing them to cut corners and zip through short cuts ensuring they can catch up to the bomb carrier forcing high speed team fighting and chaotic offensive or evasive driving depending on your role. Scoring the bomb three times will result in a win!During game play you can earn ""Metal"" by beating up on the opposition that allow you to buff your vehicle and its abilities in various ways. You can pick from an assortment of generic boosts like additional health and higher damage or you can directly boost the effectiveness of your abilities. These customization options only last for a single match meaning that you can experiment with different builds and adapt your build to counter the bad guys or compliment your friends.More recently an in game VoIP has been added WHICH I LOVE. I can’t stress this enough, yes it leads to people flaming, yes you will have mic trolls, and soundboards can be annoying (or really awesome if done well) BUT nothing showcases a community's culture or encourages competitive play like VoIP in game. I’ve spent way too many hours playing Counter Strike and I firmly believe the allowing for mic communication in game is a core reason that the Counter Strike franchise has had so much staying power in the eSports universe. Players can strategize, communicate on a deeper level, and even when players are being salty, VoIP can encourage a competitive culture that drives eSports participation in a game. There have been complaints about flaming and mic spamming (I have been flamed on stream) but I think the benefits of open, in game VoIP far out weight the costs in a game built for competition like Heavy Metal Machines.CharactersThe motif of a Gwar Concert meets Mad Max Fury Road and what must have been a comic book obsessed art team to create the Metal Heads that populate Heavy Metal Machines' Character selection screen. Every character has a story, style, and sound track with move sets that compliment their personalities. Run the bomb to its final destination with a speed metal obsessed ""transporter"" class or knock your opponents off course with crowd control heavy ""interceptors"". Feeling like more of a soft rock fan? That's ok, HMM has support characters that allow you to heal friends, debuff bad guys, and out right silence the enemy jam session. My favorite Character at the moment is Full Metal Judge, technically an interceptor, FMJ can lay down the damage with a front mounted gatling gun while pulling away from the pack with a ramming ability that doubles as a speed boost. Worth mentioning that I haven't tried out Killer J, a clown of questionable morals, who was released in a recent patch. CriticismThe VoIP could be open during the character select screen so that teams could more easily communicate composition and character selection.Players dropping from matches leading to unbalanced 3v4 (or worse) fight. I wont comment on this much since Hoplon has already addressed it in a recent post. The gist is that players are dropping from matches more frequently than expected and the game does not attempt to replace the lost player at this point.While simplicity of objective and the games easy to grasp control scheme are some of the game’s greatest strengths they do create a depth of content issue. After testing out a few characters you’ll eventually find a character you resonate with and likely stick to them as you grind your fame up and level up the driver to unlock new skins. Once you complete your daily quests it’s the same map and game mode over and over again. The ability to upgrade cars in match can break this up if you are willing to experiment with builds but this can only go so far. What the game could use at a minimum are additional maps or possibly some additional game modes. Hoplon has already addressed some of these concerns in a recent post stating that ""our main – competitive – game mode is the bomb delivery. Which does not mean that we will not build other modes or that the current map will be the only one ever. We fully plan in adding more maps for the bomb mode, and – eventually – adding different modes altogether."".Some of the abilities are meant to be held down as opposed to pressing and quickly releasing the button associated with an ability. If a player actually reads the tool tip this is pretty obvious but assuming that most players don’t actually read menus there may be a UI change that could make this game mechanic more obvious to new players.Review was originally posted to http://www.infirmarygaming.com/articles/news/general/58/game-review-heavy-metal-machines-beta/In full disclosure Hoplon has provided DLC content to the Infirmary Gaming Community which I manage and write for.

								Feels to me like a MOBA version of Rocket League. It took all of 30 seconds to hook me. It's a bit like tug-of-war with vehicles and explosives.It's reasonably accessible to newbies, but a lot of room for competitive play, and the devs are working to enhance both aspects.The player base isn't huge, but if you play on the EU servers instead of NA, it usually only takes about 3 minutes to find a match.

								Good game concept, poor controls.This game reminds me of a game called rock n roll racers from back in the day. The music is metal (cant go wrong with that), the design looks good. Gameplay is a twist on MOBA style games, making it entertaining for a bit. Graphics are cool (not the best for todays standard, but who cares!).Controls are what let the game down. You either use mouse and keyboard, in not the way you'd think; or use an xbox360 controller for windows, no other usb controller (or wireless if you have one) will work. This is what really lets the game down.People complain about online lag, is early access, it may have a few issues there			",148,16,6,15,28,0,23

								Quite the interesting game. The metal aspect is what drew me to this game. The metal aspect is well done in my opinion. The art is interesting and the gameplay is fun, though the announcer can be annoying at times. For early access it's really good, for a full free to play game it's okay, and it looks promising. Someone else went on about lag, I didn't have any in the offline segments (maybe I was just lucky) and there were one or two lag spikes when I played for about half an hour online (I had a good connection), but it's still in early access so I expect the developers to fix such problems when it is eventually released for real. Pros- Proper gameplay- Great music- Good art- Enthousiastic announcerNeutral- It's a MOBACons- It's in early access			",91,38,4,12,12,1,10

								Even in Early Access, the game is pretty complete, with a few minor bugs.But let's go to a more specific review :)Pros:- Fast paced action;- Somewhat similar to a MOBA, yet VERY different from one;- Larry Hoffman;- Simple, yet strategical gameplay;- The music!!!- Interactive tutorial;- Help screen with topics, if the tutorial was not enough to make you learn the game;- The developers interact with the comunity to make the game better;Cons:- The matchmaking is weird, to say the least;Others:- The actual controls (IMO they are very annoying), but this doesn't enter the cons, due to constant changing based on feedback.- Some new players (MOST) that refuse to learn the game (there is an interactive tutorial AND a help page with topics), and this make the gaming experience terrible for the others.This is NOT a racing game!!! It's a car arena game!!!Learn the difference please. The main goal of the game is the bomb that spawn in the center of the arena.DO the tutorial, join the official Discord, the forums, the facebook page, and ask your questions about gameplay. The comunity is very receptive to players wanting to learn to play the game. But using the excuse of ""i don't know how to play"" to ruin other people matches is frowned upon.Again, this is NOT a racing game. Learn the game before going into pvp.			",221,51,4,42,12,1,17

								First thing I seen was the tutorial cutscene, I was sold; Was just about the same as Twisted Metal: Black.Great game, very funny moments.Fast paced, Easy to slip up.Your objective is to grab the bomb in the middle of the base and take it back to your spawn point. There are other things than just that, But it's the jist of it anyways.I seen that a champ was being sold for 10k fame, so expect the same basis of league of legends. Overpowered champs when they're new, get nerfed back to oblivion when another new one comes out-wash and repeat.Other than that, this game is awesome and can't wait to see what becomes of this game.I would reccomend this game to LoL, Dota, or just plain old, racecar driving fans.

								------------    FIRST IMPRESSIONS   -----------------Haven't had those ""crashes"" some talk about yet. Playerbase is not low, there aren't much players either. It takes 1-2 minutes to find a 4vs4 game. If you are into metal/ rock/ punk/ goth culture this game offers great music and characters. Gameplay is simple but it has a lot of potential for players to improve themselves which is what I liked most about the game. Since it's a very new game it lacks maps and characters (1 map and 9? characters). Talent system could be better, most of the talents look useless. I really can't find bad things about this game.If you aren't sure whether to play it or not just give it a try for 2-3 hours, it's a free game and you will probably like it.  ",44,3,2,7,3,0,4

								The game has a good concept and is fun to play. It feels like if someone took rocket league and mixed in just a little bit of MOBA aspect. The goal is to take a bomb across a race track to the enemy goal, if you get the bomb you job is to drive and/or protect the bomb all the way across the enemy side of the map. If the enemy get the bomb your job is to steal the bomb back and kill the people protecting it. It is simple but fun and makes for decently long matches if the players are good enough to be able to keep stealing the bomb back from each other and race up and down both sides of the track.The only downside, besides a few notes I added at the bottom that I feel could use fixxing in that game as of the date I posted this, is there isn't many players so waiting for a match takes a while, the easy solution to this though if you like what this game sounds like then give it a try. The only real thing that is holding this game back is its population so if you play perhaps tell your friends about it as well then that problem will go away fast. a note to the devs:I do have two complaint and that is the damage scaling on a lot of these cars, it feels way to dificult  to kill anyone in a timely basis unless everyone targets that car, i feel we need to raise the damage and repair values on some skills. Also I think there should be more wait time inbetween each round because it is too frantic to try and stop and apply skill points in the middel of the race, so I have found myself only applying points in between rounds but the ammount of time in makes me have to make rushed decisions without fully even looking at what my options are. I would say adding five to ten seconds would be enough to let people make a good choice without just clicking whatever they can afford so they can get back into the race. Other than that I love what you did with this and look forward to future updates.			",72,14,1,4,4,1,4

								Remember that game by X-Gen studios way back when? Black Rage online? Probably don't... Uhh... Interstate '76? No... That's too realistic... I mean, PS generation Twisted metal would be a good comparison I suppose, but it's got less of a pick-up and map-focused game. ♥♥♥♥ it, basically it's a surprisingly well polished top-down arena shooter with an emphasis on class/ability based team play. The game plays quite smooth and controls well, and can have keys rebound to how you like. My only real problem with it is lack in content, and lack of expanded metal genres. Seems like it's only got rock metal for now, but would do well with others like industrial and perhaps that which made the DOOM soundtrack so good. though I have to give the composer credit, as I found myself losing a match headbanging...

								This is a fantastic mashup between Twisted Metal and Rock N Roll Racing all folded into a MOBA format.  The game is 4 v 4 Bomb Run, which pits playes in a symmetrical arena with mini race tracks on either side.  The bomb spawns in the middle and the teams fight to carry the bomb through the opposing team's track and into their goal.  There are three classes: transporter, support and interceptor.  Transporters specialize in moving the ball, interceptors specialize in damage and crowd control while support specializes in heals and crowd control.  The first time I played it, I honestly thought it was a frantic mess.  Ten games later, I'm strategizing with my friends over team comp, devising new ambushes and learning to drive backwards while carrying the ball and fighting off enemies.  The game offers surprising depth and competition, while the devs have already promised new modes which all sound amazing.  I'd say the only thing the game currently lacks is a playerbase, so hop on in!			",248,80,11,59,43,5,41

								Remember Rock N' Roll racing on the Sega Genesis? It's like that, but a 1000 times better. If you weren't alive to play video games in the 90's, Heavy Metal Machines is a 4v4 fight over a single bomb that has to be delivered to the enemies goal. You have different classes of cars to choose from. Healers that heal, interceptors that fight, and transporters that are good at moving the bomb. Each match lets you buy upgrades specific to your character, things like extra damage from your Q attack or faster nitro cooldown. Teamwork is important, as you can pass the bomb to another teammate if you need to. Teammates also have to help heal you and peel off the enemy as they try to stop you from delivering the bomb. The 1 level you play on has hazards that can pop the ball off the carrier or just destroy a vehicle in lava which adds extra strategy.Pros - Fun, and unique gameplay        - Car choices are varied and all have different strengths and weaknesses        - Announcer and character voices are great. At respawn a certain character might say ""Witness me!""        - Graphics are good and the game runs in 4k for me on my 1070        - Mouse controls work wellCons - AFKer's. It's a problem in any game. When someone afk's here no bot takes over and the player's car just sits there         - Bit of a grind to buy anything in game. It's all cosmetic though         - 1 map, and only 1 gamemode. Early access woes. I hope they get at least 4 more maps and add a racing mode The game runs very smoothly for me, unlike some other reviewers. I haven't had any crashes or freezing issues. It's a free game! Try a few rounds, play each type of car to see what fits your play style.			",44,3,1,3,2,0,5

								Before anything i'd like to say, Not only is this game amazing but also fun so far and i can't wait for more maps, game modes and characters. Even the soundtrack is pretty sweet. There needs to be more games that not only has a Rock n Roll soundtrack but a metal as h*** game as this. A game that isn't afraid to show a rock n roll nature. I really hope this can become a big title among the racing and MOBA genres. <So far though, i have two complaints. These are minor complaints but can still steer away some players. 1st: The first complaint has to do with changing settings grapical or other. I've personally had the game try to if not crash when ever i would try to change these settings to my preference. This after only clicking one thing to change and it happens everytime i try to change something. 2nd: This maybe a nit pick but i find it odd that the punishing system for leavers is attatched to Practice Mode. I find this a problem because most/some people don't want to play a regular match, don't know if they can play the game at all with other players, testing out different graphics, or just wants more try a new character(game modes and maps later)and train vice versa. It seems rather silly to punish someone who wasnt in a real PvP match. No one should get punished from deciding that they've got a hang of the character and want to leave the bot match to try he/she out in a PvP match or because someone disconnects due to bad connection in a bot/Practice match either.> End of complaint, sorry if i emphasized too much on the last bit. Anyways, you guys are doing awesome, game is awesome and i hope everything can get worked out. Thank you for listening and give me feedback if you get this message. So i know you got the message and i didnt waste my time, lol.			",98,11,3,4,7,0,8

								Community is dead, BUT it is deffinatley a solid game and I love it from what I got to play. If there was a offline/online single player campaign I would love it even more and deffinatley keep the game. Sadly, to the best of my knowledge the game is only online multiplayer and since no one is on the servers I can't play it...  Other wise great game if community gets started back up			",13,0,1,2,0,0,1

								Actually pretty fun little game. Well polished mechanics and UI. Kept my attention and it doesn't throw microtransactions in your face. My only critique is that the match lengths are slightly longer than I would prefer (lengths are closer to DOTA/LoL than Rocket League). ",250,46,4,49,26,1,40

								If any of you are old enough to have played twisted metal black or sprint the old arcade game I would be very suprised if you don't enjoy this game, the game at this point has been out a month it's pretty buggy with dc's but its an early access game that doesnt steal your money and is complete but with little content, it's free, fun and worth a try!Happy to see an early access game that is actually playable for a lengthy amount of time and no large price tag for somthing uncomplete, micro transactions are completely optional and a good way to support the developers.(by complete I mean all of the games core is there it just needs ironing and future content)			",111,18,3,15,11,1,4

								So anyone who has played Rock and Roll Racing back in the day has to give it a try.  Pros - Announcer is great - Gameplay is fun - I could be very good if it gets a steady populationCons - After you drop the ball and score the round is over... you still get killed.  It is just annoying. - At the start of each match the camera goes in and out of focus then pans.  The combination makes me dizzy and something close to nausianted.  It is pointless. - Queued for  10 min to play againts players.  Nothing happened. - Bots are too easy, traps on the track are too easy. Put traps in the center not the sides where you wouldn't drive anyway.More cons then pros but the gameplay trumps all the cons.  Give it a shot.			",11,2,0,4,0,0,4

								Summary:You kills other cars with your car which has car powers but everyone also has car powers and there's a bomb. Pros:+Gameplay is really, really fun in its current state.+It's super easy to get the hang of. Tutorial takes about 5 minutes and after that. you're off! +Characters seem well balanced+How well you do is based on how well you can manuever the car+New, fresh game concept (as far as I am aware)Nuetral: This can be seen as good or bad depending on your preference, but non of the abilities do a lot of damage. This makes fights last longer, but makes positioning more crucial and does a good job at balancing fights since it relies less on who you pick but rather on who is a better player in general. Cons:-Art style and general aesthetic is pretty.... unappealing. Game looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥. -Voice acting is atrocious and annoying.-Long waiting times to get into a match, I imagine this will be resolved with more players.-My game freezes every 30 seconds for about a second while I'm playing, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game.

								Hello Gamers,Just want to say this game is the Bomb! A Heavy Metal Bomb ! ( and it has machines )Downloaded because it is a free game, never thought it could be this fun.So it's fast, it has guns, cars ( bad♥♥♥♥♥cars ), good music ( and I don't even know what metal music is ), it's addictev. All you need is a few games, 3-4-5, depending on your flexibility, you need to read the abilities of you cars, ( that takes 3 min and you are a pleb if you play mobas and don't know ur abilities, i mean, ""what are you doing ?"" ) to get into the Real FUN. And yeah It is REALY FUN.You don't have to believe me, just play 3-4 games with the same car.It also has cons. Sometimes the que time cam be long, 5-10 min max, Low player based. Only one map. Low number of cars.The cons can dissapear if the player base will increase. So ... If you like it after a few games, this game will grow and will level with all the popular mobas, and even grow to get at a eSport level.PS: i'm writing the review to convince people to join the game, cuz the game will improve if we get more player base.So, up to you. All the best.			",45,3,0,12,5,0,7

								Reasons I don't recommend this game. (will change the review after dev fix these problems)1.Crash-game easily crash and reconnect gives 0exp and fame.2.Glitch-sometimes the screen will froze at one place(especially after the touchdown) but you know the game is still on going. there was still fuel bar when start of another round. but u couldn't do anything but to disconnect and apparently after disconnect you can't reconnect. wasted 1 round time.3.Chat-you can't just close the chat when the game just ended. We should be able to chat during the scoreboard and reward phase. What kind of game doesn't let you type in GG at the end of a game.4.Buy-when we buy stuff we need time to read regarding what does it do, but all I did in this game is just simply buy stuff without even looking because there was no time to even look. This is not d2 or LOL, this game's round end fast. If one of the player takes their time waiting in spawn and shopping with ur mama, the opponent will surely reach our spawn.5.Class/role-When I play with other players I will see what role they pick. Transporter/interceptor/support is important. For default there should be 1 trans 1 supp 2 inter, but I've to click on every one of the character that my teammate choosen to be able to know what is the role. It was pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ We should be able to see the role of teammates easier.That was all for major parts. There was still more but I don't think that was important. Just some small details for improvement.1. Change the score to number rather than 3 bar above the screen.2.Can check out profile of each cars at the menu rather than going to store.3.add voice that state that ""you have possession of the bomb"", ""your team drop the bomb"" or ""enemy team drop the bomb"" etc rather than ""stop it, stop it, stop it now UHHh!!~~""(something that is not useful) That was it for now. Hope that developers can fix it and improve.			",50,2,1,1,6,0,4

								Give the game a shot its currently free to play. You can play all the cars and no money involved to Pay to Win. My maching if 5 years old and plays the game without a hitch so cannot comment on the people giving bad review because of lag or unable to play.  Its kind of like a MOBA in the sense you have to push the ""lane"" or in this case the 1 track and carry the bomb over the end line.  The game is 4 v 4 in PvP and the games when evenly matched take around 20 to 25 minutes. Its much quicker when one side is more experienced than the other team. But as I have been on that side a lot lately at least the game ends quick. :) The cars are all unique and well balanced at this point.  There are 3 main types and within each type different styles such as the interceptor or carry can either push, pull using a skill shot or just do a lot of damage. The bomb carrier is fast or has some sort of small heal mechanic.  The support heals but each in a different way depending on how you like to play.  Overall the game is fun to play and I was shocked I liked it so much. I only tried it as it was free and was looking for something different that I could pick up at any time and play. This fits the bill perfectly.  I also like that the cars are all playable and I don't have to drop any money to get the ""must"" have cars to compete.  I plan on throwing a few bucks at the game when it goes live to show my gratitude for this decision if it is kept that way at launch. Again just try it, but please play a few practice games first! :)			",11,0,0,1,2,3,14

								Hell yes, this will be a ton of fun I think, I couldn't play with my controller (Xbone elite) as it refused to give me any forward motion or steering, this has happened with other games as well they've all worked fine with the normal Xbone controller though.I decided to play with mouse but I did notice it put quite a strain on my wrist as I was pressing way too hard, this is of course my fault and not the game's. (it also has a bit to do with being new to the game of course)You can bind the keys as you wish including mouse keys and even though that should be something normal it isn't so I've noticed so I thought I'd mantion it.It's free, it's fun and it's metal madness, grab it and have a laugh. :)			",37,27,9,6,3,1,10
