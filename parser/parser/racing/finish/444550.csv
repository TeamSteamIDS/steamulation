SummaryVoid 21 is a fun game that is very easy to pick up and play, the game is very fast-paced which can be challenging for newcomers,  and as you continue to play you begin to 'unlock' new enemies and obstacles which keeps the difficulty up as you get better at the game. Luckily you also unlock new weapons, engines, shields and other useful modules to counter the new threats.Gameplay: 8 / 10The core gameplay is a lot of fun and is very addictive, you get a real sense of speed as you fly down the track and it's a nice rush as you narrowly thread the needle through groups of pillars and other obstacles. There is a lot of variety as you unlock new enemies and obstacles, and the various properties that determine how a level generates cater to different playstyles.  The seed picker lets you input a custom level seed to generate a level that is as challenging or easy as you'd like.  I haven't encountered any real bugs, there's a few fun moments with the physics where you'll shoot an object and it'll go bouncing along the track ahead of you, which could be considered a 'bug' but it's not exactly a problem and is hilarious to watch.Controls:  10 / 10The game feels great to play, the controls are nice, responsive and are fully customizable, and nothing feels slow or sluggish, there's not much else to say here other than that.Performance: 10 / 10Nothing to say here other than that the game runs great on my crappy work laptop, albeit at a lower resolution and with the graphics settings set to minimum. The game has a huge set of graphics options (probably more than required for a game that isn't exactly graphics intensive anyway, but still very much appreciated) to ensure that the game should run fine on any machine or toaster you put it on.Graphics: 7 / 10The game is not intended to have realistic graphics, the art style is very much focused on a retro tron-like look and looks great.  I think it could have a bigger variety of colors on some of the obstacles.Sound Effects: 8 / 10There's not much to say about the sound effects other than they are what you'd expect from a retro-themed game, 'pew-pew' effects for laser guns, whoosh's as you fly past pillars, etc. Music: 9 / 10The music in Void 21 is very catchy, and fits the game perfectly, my only gripe is that there are currently only 5 music tracks, however it's understandable that 5 tracks are fine for the scope of the game.Replayability: 7 / 10By default games like this are always fairly replayable, as they're simple and the gameplay is addictive. Void 21 is no exception. I would like to see changes in the track, maybe slopes and dips, canyons that you can fly through, etc to add a bit more variety, however in the scope of the game it's not a big issue.UI: 6 / 10The menus are nicely layed out, there's a ton of options and it's not hard to navigate through them, however they could do with having mouse support within the menus rather than using the keyboard or a controller.  In-game there is no HUD, which I feel is an area for improvement, I think having a progress indicator to show how close you are to the end would be nice, and also a ship energy meter to stop you from running out of juice when you need it would be great.Overall: 8 / 10As the first game from Taranasus Studio, Void 21 is a fun runner/shooter hybrid that knows it's scope and is very easy to pick up and play for short sessions, the gameplay is addictive and gives you a real sense of speed, the upgrades system is nice and there is a large variety of weapons, enemies and obstacles to overcome, and I can imagine we'll be seeing more coming in future updates.

												Void 21 and me went through lows and highs but I think we managed to get along quite well! Can it be rage inducing ? Hell yesIs it unfair ? Nope!And that's the best thing about it. I love games that punish you for not paying attention without rubbing a ""haha we designed this to make you ragequit!"" Shield in your face. It's incredibly rewarding to beat a hard level and the speed feeling is amazing, there are tons of unlocks to make life easier and/or completely change the way you experience the game. The controls are very easy to learn and work perfectly with keyboard, never died thinking ""that wouldn't have happened with a gampad..."" unlike many other racing games out there.I'm also a huge fan of the graphics it's a welcome change to all the pixelated-shooter-survival-games out there and honestly it fits just perfectly without looking bland or boring and even it it may look like it, it never gets confusing or hard to see where you need to go to not smash in a wall. As a special addition: The Music is just awesome, try the Demo to see what I mean.12/10 would crash my ship again			",103,42,1,34,12,0,19

+ Extremely fast and frantic gameplay where you go along these tracks FILLED with all sorts of obstacles+ Fantastic electronic/cybperpunk soundtrack that fits perfectly with the fast-paced style of the game+ Visually the game looks great with a sort of minimalistic neon cyber style+ Very fluid animations and controls that feels great to play+ The levels get very challenging as you progress+ Rewarding as you finish runs you earn experience, and as you level you get new parts for your ship such as faster engines, better guns, and other perks+ High replayability, as you progress you also unlock new types of enemies and obstacles - Some of the runs feel very long in length, I really wish there was some sort of meter that showed you how close you were to the end of the stage.

												Mind-blowingly fast passed!I found myself moving my body with the ship as I hesitantly avoided obstacles hoping I didn't collide. I haven’t tried this with VR yet but the amount of swinging and sliding I do just trying avoid that last obstacle I feel like in there already! I dare you to try playing without moving!Void 21 is a fun, very fast passed arcade style runner and shooter RECOMEDED! ",36,12,2,9,14,0,7

												This game is fun! The premise is simple but very well executed. The sense of speed is amazing. I love the quotes in the menu and the descriptions of the ship mods. The controls are tight and although the game can get difficult, it is never unfair. It works very well on linux (linux mint), no performance issues. Only issue I noticed was graphical artifacts after crashing as the camera moves around your remains. Some parts of the screen flash black. Minor thing and does not affect gameplay at all.P.S. From what I've seen online the dev is a cool dude.			",173,32,12,7,7,2,8

												So, Void 21 is really giving me a hard time to review. The execution is good, the graphics and performance impressive and the soundtrack unique. But for me, it isn't really fun. The missions are repetitive, the obstacles hard to see and the color choices overall are really giving me a hard time to see. If you are into challenging, fast paced games and like a retro vibe: get this game. But personally, I feel the price is not really justified. The game seems to generic for my taste, the options are fiddly to navigate and some personalization is missing. By that, I don't mean gameplay wise (as you can upgrade your spacship by progressing). I think using the colors more, and lifting the racing into the third dimension could really benefit this game.			",60,12,1,8,19,0,29

												I didn't play for long and that's why I have to give a negative review. Void 21 is fun, it looks good, it feels good but that's about all it does. There is nothing bringing you back to improve your skills, no versus, no big fights, no outlandish upgrades, just the same. The upgrades and tracks don't offer enough to make me want to go back. I appreciate the idea of daily challenges I really do but they aren't enough to make me play on. More information in my first impressions here:
