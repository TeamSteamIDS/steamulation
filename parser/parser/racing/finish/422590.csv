								It's so rare to see a PC game featuring a 4 players split screen mode and even if it still need some optimizations, the game feels pretty promising!			",443,135,14,31,35,11,43

								A great remake of a classic dos game. A little rough around the edges but captures the spirit of the first game and builds upon it's strengths. 8/10 for now, menu is quite glitchy sometimes, and hopefully we can get a map editor and workshop support for this...these two things would make it an easy 10/10.

												A fun remake of a classic kart racing game. Reminds me of my early gaming days on SNES playing Mario Kart. The retro yet polished visuals and classic kart mechanics/weapons make this a must have for kart racing fans.  Verdict: 8/10			",303,78,22,28,33,3,46

												Good, but I also think you screwed up, there's too much advantage to take with the power slide, you can overlap everyone multiple times if used correctly, would I recommend, yeah, it's fun. but I feel like I'm relying purely on power sliding for serious gain, rather than using it like in the classic to maneuver extremely sharp turns, I believe the speed maintained at the fullest of using power slide/drift . should also be capable of achieving without  the power slide.  I feel if you don't do this, the game will get old pretty quick, just being honest, but I do enjoy it, and consider playing time time I wouldn't not listen to what was said in this review, and get to patching. This isn't wacky wheels hd through my eyes, its just another wacky wheels that might not leave as big as a impression in my memory as the first. Also I have to port forward to play with buds, whats the deal guys lol?			",206,9,1,13,8,0,5

												For the released game the menu is far to glitchy. Like mouse is not working on all the buttons if you choose Grand Prix and 2 Players. You can't switch the characters with the mouse.The gameplay did not feel like the old game, or the classic version i got in steam.In the old games you got nearly stopped when you hit a border.Well only played some minutes and stopped - I loved Wacky Wheels in the old days and play the classic version. Hoped i could have some multiplayer fun with old friends, but the game feels like a rough beta and need some pretty good clean  up the get on the level of the old wacky wheels.

												Great idea, but the input function shoud not limit one to just a keyboard or a gamepad... just use one for each player like the original game. further i'm missing a lot of annimations like the spinning wheel when selecting a character and the sounds those characters make. but i like the main design! it's fun and it his resemblances of the original game. still a lot of work to do i guess, cause if there's something happening in the background in windows i can't get the controll back in the game.

								This is Early Access, with all that means, but so far at least it is Early Access done right.  It is still being updated, the developer is listening to feedback and iterating and making meaningful changes that make the game feel better.  If you hop in now and something doesn't feel right, if you can articulate it you have a chance at seeing it get fixed.  The visuals are in the spirit of the original, which has always been an old favorite.  I am definitely looking forward to putting some more time into this as it progresses.			",101,7,8,1,7,0,6

												TL;DRNothing like the original. Terrible controls. Somewhat buggy gameplay. Boring and ill-fitting graphics design. Most of the sounds are annoying. Thin, reverby music.Yes yes, I've played the game for less than 10 minutes, but seriously, that was enough.The way the karts control is horrible. Hitting the brake in a corner, accelerates you in the opposite direction of what you're turning. And no, it's not just that the camera moves to the side when drifting (which is annoying btw). I tested it several times. I can steer sharply to the RIGHT, while driving straight, by simply pressing LEFT and brake, and vice versa. I can hardly get through a hairpin and not hit the walls, unless I brake hard (without turning), and take the corner with 10 km/h. The original game is all about timing your handbrake turns, for just about every 90+ degree turn, and your shots (making no sense) following your turning, so they're always straight ahead of you (makes for great trick-shots). In this version, none of the weapons really feel awesome to use.Then there's the movement and obstacles. The AI's seem to lag through the air when jumping, and for some reason it's like you're sped up to 5x speed when jumping, which makes it feel like you come to a grinding halt when you land, so the jumps don't even feel awesome to do. More like a weird feeling, than anything else. And you can get stuck between a tree and the wall, without touching either, when there is clearly a lot of room for you to pass between them. Also, the sound for when the karts smash together, is not good. Sounds like two cardboard boxes being smashed together, with some added distortion.I'm not too fond of the graphics, either. In the old game, a fireball looked like a fireball. Here, they're just soft-white spheres with small spikes. And nothing quite fits together. Neon-green boost-patches and jumps? Large green question marks? It all just feels half-done.Also, the music is pitchy and reverby, and doesn't really ""fit"", which reverby and pitchy music seldom does.Which ""Wacky Wheels"" did you guys play? All the things that were unique and special about the original, are gone. This is just another cartoon kart racer, with the most terrible controls I've ever seen in a kart game, in my 27 years as a gamer.I really wanted to like this game. I LOVE the original. Bought it when I was 12 with my own savings, and loved it to bits. I had seen the videos and screenshots, and knew I wasn't getting the exact same thing, but the only thing this has in common with the original, is the description on the tin: ""Animals racing karts, shooting hedgehogs at each other. Also there are bombs, fireballs and spilled oil.""			",34,3,2,4,10,0,0

Early Access Review
								Browsing for the original Wacky wheels i stumbled upong this game and decided to give it a shot.For some reason the racing feels floaty and overall like a cluster♥♥♥♥, so i dont consider it my cup of tea. However it fails in the style and looks department, the characters look hideous in comparison to the roundy and fat cartoony counterparts and its my main issue with the game so far, i cant get over how awful the character look, and it drove me to shut the game just so i dont see them anymore.Maybe it will get better gameplay wise, but really the style and aesthethic is not appealing, its not charming at all, and i know this aspect will hardly change in the future, so i cant honestly say that i recommend it even i like the idea of having one of my childhoods favorite ip getting some needed attention and love. But i would have appreciated if they somehow managed to replicate the old charm, while still making it 3D. this style of flat ground was nice looking but it surely didnt age well. It should have gone full 3d instead of still using 3d rendered pictures rotating to simulate 3d or whatever the method is used right now, it seems so bizarre and ugly.Again my major complaint is not gameplay wise, even tho there were some stuff removed like the hardturn and powerups being changed, i dont mind them as long as it helps to make for a good balanced experience; my major complaint is how the game looks, the aesthethic it choose.

												This is just terrible. I am unable to get this to work on my computer. The game just zooms out into the clouds and I can't see the race.Why is there no GFX options? This is supposed to be HD but no GFX options? huh?The controller ""sounds"" like it is working, if that is any consolation...Requesting refund.  Just horrible and unfinished. The shame of it all is that steam forced me to run this for 5mins before posting a review...			",111,4,1,7,7,1,22
