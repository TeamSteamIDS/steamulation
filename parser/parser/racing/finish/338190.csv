												Just Get Through is a 2D platformer with randomly generated levels that combines fast paced gameplay with roguelike elements to create an enjoyable experience. As a fan of platformers this was a game I wanted to get my hands on as soon as I heard about it and I'm certainly not disappointed.+Nice and simple pixel art style+Randomly generated levels means you'll never play the same level twice+You collect colour palettes which let you change the colour of the game and there's quite a few to collect/choose from+Fully destructible environment+A variety of different traps waiting to send you to your death+You get checkpoints in the levels which becomes particularly handy for later levels+As you progress through the game levels become more complex and more challenging+Every so often you get an upgrade which helps you with a certain gameplay mechanic such as increased jump height+Full controller support including the ability to rebind controls (which you'll definitely want to do)+Dev is quite active in the forums which is nice to see+There have already been a number of hotfixes and updates just over a week since launch-Very occasionally levels are impossible to complete which is due to the levels being randomly generatorVerdict:8A great little platformer well worth the small asking price.El K.

												My first review, so here goes nothing:Summary: A simple yet enjoyable platformer with a great balance of randomly generated excitement and concrete gameplay, Just Get Through is a quality addition to any collection of platformers.Pros:+ Clean, simple graphics+ Easy and responsive controls (wall-jumping isn't too hard to master)+ Changable color palettes (some are painful but quite a few are nice)+ Randomly generated levels, each playthrough is unique+ The option to add upgrades and further customize your playthroughCons:- I wish there was just maybe the slightest bit of storyline- A few rough edges graphics-wise- The sprinting feels a bit off, might be my graphics card though- Those grass-looking spikes I always forget aboutOverall consensus: Definitely very worth the low price, can't wait to see what this game becomes.

												Just Get Through is a procedurally generated precision platformer. This means it is infinitely replayable, unlike other games of this genre, where you finish all levels and that's it. On JGT every time you play is a different experience, and the game never ends! You can't actually beat it, just get far and far with practice. It's infinite.Your goal is to find the exit of each level. You have a compass to help you, but it doesn't work if you're too far. From time to time you can choose what upgrades you want, like more lives, more TNT (almost everything is destructible), better compass, higher jump, etc.The entire game has the same environment, but you can use color palettes to make the graphics look different.All in all, Just Get Through is a great game that you can play over and over, always having fun and trying to beat the better highscores on the leaderboards or making and playing custom levels.

												Just Get Through is a good platformer with rogue lite elements. It starts out with really simple layouts for classic mode and the difficulty grows as you progress through the game. You earn perks every few levels to give you more HP, or TNT.  Levels are scattered with loads of traps. The platforming is ok, feels pretty fluid. A recent addition of daily runs and other game modes adds alot more content and keeps it feeling fresh.Solid game for a good price.			",387,40,8,39,26,4,35

Summary:Just Get Through is a procedurally generated platformer made by a single developer. Many of those projects fail but this time we got awesome and cheap platformer that offers a lot of fun and challenge for the price of five euros.Pros:- Randomly generated levels. Even though you'll learn most of the level patterns, you will still be seeing something new.- It's a challenge. You might think it's easy but that's just first levels. The difficulty gets high and the level patterns are evil, especially if combined.- You can use bombs to make your own path through the level. You can blow up almost any block in any level. Hard part? No problem, bomb is your good friend.- Many modes. Daily runs, weekly runs, sandbox, coin mode,... - You can get lost. Later levels are huge and the game generates many dead ends. Note: Dead ends may also contain deadly traps. Or the way towards the dead end. Or any other way.- Graphics are pretty, you unlock color palettes (for levels) through your game progress.- Level editor. For those who doesn't like generated levels and want to show their level design skill.- It's cheap. You won't get broke, so... just get through!Cons:- This game supports gamepads, though the bomb throwing is definitely made with focus on keyboard and mouse controls.- There are some terrible dark level graphic packs where you can't see much, this makes you weakened against people that would use other graphic packs (for high score leaderboards). This fact discourages you from using the feature of randomly changing graphics style after every level, which would be otherwise great. ",2518,961,92,292,276,21,356

												//Just Get Through is a 2D Indie Adventure / Puzzle Game //// Schuitje82 Small Review //Main goal is to reach the portal simple as that.You need to jump and blast your way through the levels.Every new level it's getting harder to beat and will be randomly generated.So you will not know how to beat the new level.And finding the portal after a few levels will give you a new challenge.Because the stages are getting bigger and bigger.The beginning of the game you will be given 10x TNT so if there is something in your way ? Just blow it up.After you beaten 2 stages you will be granted a upgrade / power up.Faster running, higher jumping, refill of life, more lives, more TNT, Refill TNT there are so many to choose from.And this makes the game fun and sometimes little bit easier to play.It's really basic and fun game to play and a little addictive.I give it a 8 / 10 for the basic and challenging gameplay.If you like these 2d games.. give it a try !!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------== For more reviews go to www.gamegrin.com ==== Please don't forget to like my reviews ==			",881,207,55,74,87,9,135

												A very nice game that begins gently to make you understand how it works and that this complex over time by adding new weapons and more opponent.In addition to this, as it is a rogue-like you can at each new run  choose different advantage and understand how to progress further with every part, I highly recommend this game.

												Great fun, good music to keep your mind immersed. Nice basic features. Explosive terrain, perks all based on the basic gameplay yet each varied enough to stay interesting. Choose one from three [randomly rolled to choose from] each time you choose.You can play nice and fast or good and slow. Varied traps and good controls [very light complaints and I put controls #1 on games that are above decent.] Incredible replay unless you just plain don't like the game. Daily runs if you feel like boosting the competitive aspect.Really a good pure platformer. Blow up terrain, watch out for traps, stay alive until you die.Basics: Get to the portal each level, anyway you can or want. Each time the level gets harder/different. After [2-3?] levels you pick a perk from a pool of three chosen at random. More TNT? Slower wall slide? More HP? Faster movement? Faster movement gain faster? TNT explosion on impact? More TNT totals? I'm sure there are more.No enemies I know of, so the traps while have their own [certainly not easy at all!] danger, it has a depth of certainty so dying is quite often your own fault. Though again, not easy since you need to react if you fall and need to dodge or move fast. Perks help and you can/must use all your advantages.Complaints: I think Four choices should be given from perks. Not to make it easier but to make the random levels a bit more balanced with more abilities to choose one from. Sometimes you just can't go on because you die from not knowing the next level will require more of what you don't have.Also, the traps could use more umph and maybe a touch of Super Meat Boy's meatiness/blood. Some also just are unfairly unthreatening so you die unfairly not knowing how or when you'll die from something. [One trap looks like a rock outcropping but it kills you on contact?!]There's more but overall the game is very good and focused, could use refining and more punch-to-the-gut impact with the danger/traps or double edged perks that are really good and really bad at the same time.

												So far, I've found this game to be pretty enjoyable.  When you start a new run, the randomly generated levels will be small and have few obstacles... as you get further, you'll have to navigate larger, more confusing levels, with more frequent deathtraps of ever-increasing variety.  At first it's just sawblades and spikes, then turrets, wall-mounted shotguns, little death robots that patrol back and forth along the floor, etc..  After that?  I'm not sure.  It gets pretty challenging after a while, and I'm not good enough yet.To help you along the way, you have an arsenal of dynamite sticks that you can throw to destroy parts of the level and the traps.  You can also choose an upgrade every few levels to increase your health, dynamite capacity, jumping height, wall grip, etc.  You will also occasionally find chests that unlock new color palates to make the game look more colorful and interesting.Jumping can be a little frustrating, since the game will only let you jump off a wall once before you need to jump off a different wall to keep going up.  It's a design choice and I respect that, but it's a bit hard to get used to at first.  I also have a couple of small issues regarding gamepad play, but the Dev has already said that he'll work on resolving that.. so it's alright.  I still give the game a recommendation.  For $5 it's worth it for me.			",1075,272,30,117,79,8,109

Just Get Through is an addicting platformer with some dungeon crawling & roguelite elements. Armed only with sticks of dynamite, you must progress further and further into randomly generated dungeons with deadly traps that become harder and harder to evade. As you complete levels, you level up as well, gaining perks that help you be a better dungeon crawler. The entire game is literally a procedural death labyrinth.The game has a great difficulty curve, starting with extremely easy levels and transitioning smoothly to more complex environments. It offers a good amount of challenge for players of all skill levels. The controls are tight and the procedural generation creates unique environments to traverse.There's even a level creator where you can build your own dungeons for other players to try, and you can compare your rankings/scores daily. With the addition of huge patches like Update 1.2, Retrific has added a vast amount of content to a simple game. There are new unlockable challenge modes, like Night and Coin that add different styles of gameplay, and daily runs that challenge players to play to the very best of their ability. The amount of content added would have justified a paid DLC, but instead, the developer opted to add it all for free. All of this makes the game one of the best platformers available to buy on Steam.The main issues with the game just come from a VERY repetitive soundtrack and pixel graphics that may turn off some people. Sometimes the generation can produce near-impossible jumps or traps that some would even call unfair, but they are not always that frequent. Sometimes the amount of content the game generates lags the game enough to mess with vital jumps and maneuvers. The developer is very active, especially on the forums, and regularly updates with bugfixes and tweaks as well as some content. Although it can be played with a keyboard and mouse, it's definitely best suited to a controller. This game is incredibly fun, and it's a shame that it doesn't have a bigger player base. All in all, it's definitely worth (more) the $5.00 asking price.TL;DR: For fans of Spelunky, Limbo, Electronic Super Joy, Super Meat Boy, and other punishing platform games.			",246,48,5,31,10,2,11

 Overview	Just Get Through is a procedurally generated platformer that features a man attempting to exit an underground maze littered with obstacles such as spikes, guns and axes that will try to kill you.  Players utilize bombs, wall-jumping and wall-destroying tactics to move forward through the 50 level challenge by reaching the end point of each stage. Scoring is determined by number of levels completed, time taken to complete those levels, the amount of explosives used and the amount remaining when the game ends.Just Get Through markets itself as a procedurally generated platformer.  Essentially, this means that each level layout is generated through an algorithm with a randomly changing instance variable instead of being manually mapped out.  This results in a unique, user-specific level layout for every player who starts up a new game.  Upon completion of a level, a certain degree of difficulty is added to the next iteration of level design, ultimately resulting in a difficulty-scaling, randomized platformer.   The Good	A good procedurally generated platformer will usually bring about three major points in terms of design.  In order of importance: the level must have a solution, must become increasingly difficult at a reasonable rate, and should be captivating enough to keep player attention.  Just Get Through manages to implement all three elements to a satisfying degree. In terms of feasibility of design, each level should have a possible solution.  Given that the player does not destroy the map that is.  Just Get Through’s unique destroyable terrain mechanic in a platformer means that every decision the user makes will have an adverse effect on the pathing and solution to a level.  Every level does have a clear cut path to the finish line, but is usually littered with plenty of hazards requiring navigation of pixel-perfect jumps.  That route is usually the fastest, but comes with the greatest risk.  Users can choose to run that route for a higher score or excavate their way through a simpler solution.In terms of scaling difficulty, Just Get Through delivers through a variety of obstacles including spikes, traps, buzz-saws, pixel-perfect jumps, level length; the list is endless but they all do the same thing: they kill you.  The first 20 levels is an introductory to game mechanics where the basics are introduced to the player.  The next 30 are where the game really picks up in difficulty and are really meant to test your skills.  New obstacles are introduced and alternate paths that provide the option of an extra life or bomb are given to the user if they so choose to take the risk.  Just Get Through also manages an effective design scheme that manages to keep the player interested.  The implementation of wall-jumps implies fast-paced movement and split second decision making.  Running through a tight squeeze with buzz-saws, axes and shotguns feels rewarding.  Character upgrades every two levels provides a roguelike experience that can completely alter the playstyle and pacing of the game by giving you more utility, survivability, or speed.There are also different game modes available in the game, with the classic, the timed run and the daily run.  The classic is the core game with the randomized map, the timed run is a fixed seed, generating the same levels every time for everyone, and the daily run is a ‘one-run-a-day-but-same-for-everyone’ type of style.  This gives players an option of how they want to play the game, whether they are casual or competitive gamer. Another feature of the game is a level editor.  The level editor features real-time testing, so map makers can test their map while they build.  Once complete, you can publish your level online to let other people play your map. The Bad The controls are less than ideal and sometimes feels unresponsive, especially while wall-jumping.  Users who come in expecting Prince of Persia or even Assassin’s Creed style of wall scaling will not have a good time.  Explosives can sometimes be frustrating to use because it may blow up terrain in such a fashion that the level is no longer possible.  Without a ‘reset level’ button, this essentially means your run is over.  The color scheme and art style is also not optimal.  Yes, you can get colour pallets to change from black and white to something more appealing to the eyes, but it does nothing to aid in the differentiation between pop-up spikes, checkpoint flags and blades of grass.  In order to play safely, I often found myself stopping a good two to three seconds to see if anything pops up from the ground; which completely breaks the rhythm of the game. The custom maps made by people are similar to what you would find in Mario Maker.  A few gems in a sea of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some of the maps are completely dysfunctional, featuring an exit point floating in mid-air with no surfaces anywhere near it.  Though the game does a pretty good job at detecting maps without end-points, the logic is not fool-proof and physically impossible maps do get published.   Overall Score I personally don’t care about the level editor and avoid the custom maps because I feel the randomly generated ones are better in terms of playability and accessibility.  If I wanted a custom map to speedrun, I would just play the classic seeded version.  That being said, the basic game itself is addicting and is fun to play if you have about thirty or so minutes, so I give Just Get Through a 7/10.

												This first impressions was written from a key obtained from the developer.Just Get Through are for those type of players who really want variety out of their gaming experience, to keep things mixed up, as speedrunners won't necessarily like it due to its randomization element. It's a good time all around as while you do run into occassionally easy segments due to the randomization element, you will get the challenge ramped up over time as you use the resources such as TNT to your disposal to get through the various traps that run across. Overall, it's a great game to play quickly now and again to get an adreline rush of sorts, it's not the type of game that you'll play for hours at a time, but will enjoy it here and there. And for 5 bucks, there's a reasonable bang for buck here.+:-Variety in level design keeps things rather fresh over time.-Good mix up of roguelike elements and choices.-The ability to manipulate the environment adds a whole new level to the platforming, to make choices on what traps to take on and what not to take on.-In general, controls are great.-Variety in enemies is appropriate as it introduces new enemies and challenges in a timely matter as you go along.-:-Sometimes, randomization elements make a level ridiculously easy. -Thing the game would have done a little better going without the two color system. At times, it can be a real strain on the eyes.-Leaderboards seem pointless due to the randomization element, in particular with the levels. For More First Impressions and Gameplay:

												Just Get Through lives in this strange space between Spelunky and Super Meat Boy, a procedural platformer with loads of traps and tools to overcome them, that also gives you remarkable speed and freedom of movement. It's strange because it's not a space I'm sure that needs to be filled, because JGT has less depth than the former and less challenge than the latter. What it does have are a mess of modes to delve into, enough to keep you busy for a good long while.There's no story or hook to the game, just you in endless deadly caverns, searching for the swirling exit. You'll run into just about every unpleasant trap you can imagine, from spinning sawblades to swinging axes, scattering shotguns to grinding chainsaws, rolling boulders to bleeping mines. To get through them, your spry little fellow can run, wall jump, and chuck TNT to blow up problematic parts of the level. The first handful of levels are mostly empty halls but into the double-digits you'll start facing intense gauntlets of traps that require significant patience and precision.Every few levels you can choose an upgrade from an assortment of three, earning you boons like more lives or TNT, higher jumps, quicker sprints, or some key abilities like immunity to your own TNT or extra wall jumps. There are also different upgrades in the game's many different modes to help with the pertinent challenges. There's a Night Mode where you navigate with flares, a Coin Mode where you aim to collect as many coins as you can, and a Speed Mode where you start with tons of mobility upgrades but only one life. With nine modes in all, along with a database of user-created levels, you won't run out of traps to splatter yourself on.And yet, I found myself a bit torn on Just Get Through. The platforming is responsive and challenging, the modes offer a wide range of challenges, there are extra palettes to unlock... all the pieces are there for a great roguelike platformer, but I'd by lying if I said nothing was missing. There's a certain thinness to the game, perhaps from the lack of progression, or plot, or level features. Spelunky is defined largely by the crazy antics you can stir up, and Super Meat Boy has an incredible variety of levels and challenges, and Just Get Through doesn't really come close to either of those hooks.In the end, Just Get Through is the very definition of a good game, without poking an inch past into great game territory. The platforming is solid and there's a nigh-infinite amount of it on tap. There's just nothing beyond that to make it something special. I can certainly recommend it if you enjoy the look or the feel, but there's always going to be something better out there.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Crazy game! And surprisingly fun. I wish there was a feature that allowed you to log out and come back to a game later. I spent the first 3 hours of playing the game getting to like level 40 and just needed a break. So I lost all my progress, even though I was still doing really well. My only complaint. For that reason only I'll give the game 9/10 instead of full marks. This game could also really do with a multiplayer option so you could race your friends to the end of each level.

												This game is so very fantastic. Each run is so different and you can go at it so many ways that it doesn't really get dull. Dying in this has a real weight to it since you spend a decent amount of time on each run. When you run out of tnt or you blew up your only path to the portal, you get a feeling of failure most other games cannot replicate. The color pallates are a great idea, but they could have been executed better. All in all, this game is definitely one of my favorites and I would seriously reccomend it.			",63,15,0,6,4,0,1

												You know, I think I've come to the conclusion that this is one of the fairest platformers I've ever played.Spikes only kill you if you are impaled, act like walls if you hit them from the sideProjectiles will kill you, but the shit that fires them won't and you can slide pastMines and drones have a window for you to escape if you're stupidunlucky enough to trigger themYou can just dig/explode your way to the finish if that's how you wanna goUpgrades actually stack so you can effectively moonjump or make walls disintegrate when you look at themMost surprisingly is that the levels are just the right amount of challenging and the difficulty curve is juuuust steep enough to make beating each level and earning each upgrade into a real reward. The level generation is pretty great too, it never makes any impassible portions of maps (at least none that you can't work around somehow) and every time you go through the levels will be so different from the last time that it stays fresh for a long time.Great game I give it a 9/11			",485,81,10,40,48,1,28

												Really great game. Pretty hard and addicting. It's like a mixture of Super Meat Boy and Risk of Rain. Mission is from the point A get to the point B avoiding all kinda dangers like in Super Meat Boy, but levels are every time different like is Risk of Rain. Soundtrack is good too.

												It is very much like Super Meat Boy but I like it 100% more. THis game is honestly one of the best of it's kind. Other games that are like this (and super meat boy) involve too much death and really don't motivate the player enough to want to continue. This game includes lots of color pallets you can unlock, has upgrades you can randomly get, and it contains a lot of unlockable game modes. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good challenge. The only problem is the price. I think this game is a few hours of fun at the most, which is why picking it up on sale ($1) is a better choice.  9/10			",101,13,0,6,7,0,2

I thought ""Maybe I'll get a little bit of entertainment out of it.""  This is a gem.  This is a wonderful game.8.5/10  Fantastic.Serious review time.This game is unforgiving in level difficulty sometimes, but extremely forgiving in that you can be overlapping with some of the traps just barely and not have to worry about getting fricked-over for it.  It also gives you these handy little explosives that stick to walls and to traps, and those let you get rid of the eviscerating and impaling traps.The controls are responsive and snappy, and there's an ever-so-slight amount of momentum going on that lets you over-correct without completely ruining yourself.The upgrades are, while simple, very nice to have and essential to the game.  I feel that I'm going to get a decent amount of stream content from this game because it's so easy on the computer and so easy to talk over.  Very much recommend, ESPECIALLY when it's on sale.  Honestly, I may just buy it for a friend at full price because I want to support the dev(s) who made this.  Awesome job, guys!			",134,22,0,11,12,2,9

												Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action game Just Get Through. Just Get Through was released on Steam on January 30, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Retrific.(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)Video Review:

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Great fun to be had here for under $5. Highly replayable. 4/5The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:This is a great little indie game that may have slipped by you last year. Just Get Through me is kind of an interesting little game. It's tons of fun, has plenty of game modes and can become heavily addictive! The randomly generated levels are fun enough on their own, just trying to get through (as the title suggests). You plot your way through the course and avoid the traps to get to the other side. You even have dynamite to help blast away traps/walls. There is also a Daily Run, that is the same for everyone and you can compare high scores both globally and across friends. Chart your runs, your high scores, and have a blast. The graphics have a fun retro feeel (you can even unlock different color schemes!), the gameplay is simple and fun (and controller supported too!). This is a great little gem that may have passed you by in 2015. It's already a great deal at under $5, and in the upcoming Steam sale this could be one of the better bargains. 4/5, worth it for sure.Happy Gaming!			",1201,557,39,163,210,15,217

												Cruddy, haphazard random level generation.  Several bizarre, uncomfortable systems in place to destroy the stage itself in what feels like a very wrong way to allow the player to somewhat circumvent said bad level generation when the need arises -- and yes, this will very, very often make levels impossible to complete.  Too much of the game centered around this mechanic, with the game even begging you to use mouse-and-keyboard mode (which anyone who plays 2d platformers with a gamepad will agree is extremely uncomfortable for this type of game) in order to have better aiming of your dynamite to destroy the level, as well as MANY of the powerups centering around this dynamite mechanic (and at least one powerup I saw actually lessening the enemies' ability to RANDOMLY DESTROY THE STAGE).  An obnoxious aiming reticule for said TNT mechanic, with no way to turn it off.  Very painful, heavy, jerky platformer physics -- for those who've played Super Smash Bros. Melee, think Falco in a metal cap at all times.  Some of the most wretched and impossible-to-decipher walljumping mechanics I've ever felt in a game.  Plain, uninspired graphics that do even less to get the job done than most slapdash retro indie games.  Music's nothing to write home about.  No story to speak of, and gameplay that's certainly far from good enough to make up for that.  Oh, and by default, the rumble and screenshake are severely overkill and unnecessary, but at least you can turn those off.Just skip it.  There are literally hundreds of far better 2d platformers and randomly-generated games out there.			",536,95,4,93,12,2,46

												I dunno, this isn't quite there yet, I find. The controls for the most part are responsive and tight but there's a few issues that pop up that result in what feel like very cheap deaths. For one, when holding the dash button, sometimes walljumps will drop and whoosh back to the floor with you (or spikes, if those are under you). Even more grating is... uhh, that jumping off wall grates doesn't work half the time, thus WHOOPS you landed right on the thing you were trying to avoid because no jump for you.The level generation also isn't quite there yet... the game's able to never provide a truly impossible scenario (I think) but unrealistically unreasonable scenarios can pop up and usually the only solution is to TNT your way through rather than try to deal with the likely death caused by attempting one of these scenarios. The levels don't tend to have much of a smooth difficulty curve because most of the time you'll die on a level with one of these scenarios multiple times without dying much on the levels immediately before or after it. The levels also get a bit stale after a while, there's not much variety to be found. I dunno, I like this kind of game in theory but it really needs a high level of polish to be enjoyable and it just quite isn't there yet for me. With a few tweaks I could see this being a really fun game though.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												It isn't funny at the beginnig, but after a few levels it gets interesting, and you just can't stop playing. Overall is not too much difficult, just in a few occasions you can find situations where a lot of skill is required. The graphics are interesting and quite original, and the soundtrack seems really good to me.Love the Custom levels feature and the colorpalettes variety, though some of them look awful. If you like platform games, you won't regret buying this one, since the procedurally generated levels feature gives you a new experience in every single game, if you don't, well, there's nothing that can attract you in this game.

While levels are randomly designed it lends to a unique experience and I absolutely love the color pallete collectables and special perks every 2 levels completed - that adds so much variety and fun to the game.  While I haven't spent a ton of time with 'Just Get Through' I really think its worth a look.			",125,70,2,54,10,1,29

												Think Spelunky crossed with N++.+ Random Generation works well+ Movement is pretty fluid. The game never makes the mistake, you do.+ Lots of unlckable colour palletes, which can also double as difficulty modifiers (e.g. Nightmode)- Whilst there's a lot of variation in deathtraps, some more throwable items apart from TNT would be nice (Unless I just haven't found them yet)- Upgrades could also do with variation. Verdict: Buy it			",53,16,0,11,7,1,21

												""Roguelite"" platformer with simple combat mechanics.Disclaimer: this review is from someone who is not very goot at platformers.Pros:*Various modes;*Responsive;*Procedurelly generated levels forces to adapt;*Traps require serious effort to time everything right;*Leaderboards are a cool feature;*Level creator;*That visual awards for reaching LVL50 is trivial, but pleasing;*Visuals are minimalist and functional.Cons:*Classic mode can draw for over 1 hour. For me it is too long, I hate playing the first 20 levels over and over again, just to reach more interesting levels (45+). It is just such a joy killer. I understand that the ""save current game"" function would be abused, but there are other ways to solve this problem. For example, unlockable difficulty slider or the ability to skip levels. This is the main reason I stopped playing. Yes ""hardcore"" mode is challenging, but it's not my cup of tea.*Lacks ""Race mode"". But no big deal.Tl; dr: it is worth the price (I paid 1,2 (or so) Euros). But I didn't expect to burn out so fast.  9/10 color palettes. ",41,1,2,2,4,0,10

Short VersionUPDATE January 2016:One-man develepor Retrific has updated and extended Just Get Through many times. Most recently, a surprise Winter 2015 update added a new game mode: Explosion Runs: this is probably my favourite game type, which adds an element of panic as you try to move quickly enough through the traps while staying ahead of a wall of explosions chasing you. If you like to take your time getting through the regular levels, this mode will literally put a fire under your♥♥♥♥♥and force you to make your decisions on-the-fly. Props to the developer for adding free content after the cutoff point.~~~Just get Through is a rogue-like platformer, presented simply on the surface, with an addictive core of gameplay underneath. The basic premise of Just Get Through is to make it the end of as many procedurally-generated levels as possible before running out of lives. You can jump, rebound off walls or blow away portions of your environment with TNT. This makes for some interesting gameplay decisions because you can choose to speed through the levels using wall jumps and precision platforming to get to the end, or take your time to plan an alternate route or create your own with TNT (being careful not to blow up platforms necessary to complete the level). Many game modes are included, e.g: Set Run offers an unchanging set of levels so you can master the layoutsNight Run has you navigating in the dark with the aid of flares and a glowing player character. Very cool mode!Coin Run: collect coins to spend on upgradesSurvival Run: get as far as you can with only 1 life and without health drops or upgrades.Speed Run: play with faster movement speed and easier jumping and aim for the fastest completion time.Hardcore Mode: see for yourself... or checkout the video (link below) for an example ...Color palettes sometimes drop from treasure chests, which make the default black and white particle effects and explosions look much cooler. If that still isn't enough replay value for you, try out the user created levels or have a go at making your own and track the performance of community members playing it.

												Best platformer I ever played!Procedural levels work great.Always a new challenge. No learning intricate patterns. Plenty of crazy random death traps!I love the feeling of just flying by the seat of my pants, dodging between spikes and shotguns and razor shap pendulums.This game has me making all sorts of noises as I get surprised by the chain reaction that killed me, or as I get so close to the exit only to be hit in the back by an arrow, or as I realise my TNT explosion just made it even harder to finish the level.Seriously, my wife always asks if I'm OK while I'm playing this game, to which I respond, ""It's just THAT game again."" ;)Charming art. I love the way the little guys big hair bobs around as you run.All the different colour schemes keep it looking interesting and give you something to collect too.As for the limited use TNT weapon.... I first thought it was almost cheating, but it has grown on me and it's more like a tool to make some painfully hard bits, still painfully hard, but passable if you're good. Also it's not necessary to use it to get through, entirely up to the player.Also love the perks you choose from every few levels. Helps you get through, but also lets you experiment with different ways to play the game. Do you wanna try to collect heaps of extra lives, or use TNT to blast through everything, or jump higher and run faster?????Oh yeah, it has a level editor too. So you can download handcrafted death traps if you prefer that style of thing. Or make your own death traps for your beloved friends to become infuriated with.Anyway, totally worth the price tag. Awesome single man dev who seems to be still adding to the game. Awesomest platformer ever!!!			",213,37,10,38,6,4,40

												Just Get Through states it's main objective in the titleJust get through the levelIt's a fun platformer with some modes to add to the difficulty as well as a daily challenge.Not many people play this game so it's not hard to get to the top of the scoreboard as well, as this game isn't well known.The game has many pluses and I can't think of something bad about the game except that there is a rare chance you'll be spawned in a randomly generated level with no way of winning, I've only heard about this and have yet to experience it.The controls are tight, has customizable unlockable colour palets.The game progressively gets harder the farther you get into the game that sometimes getting through the first level is literally walking or a single jump, but it eventually begins to turn itself into a maze to find the end of the level and increasing in difficulty as more and more obstacles get in your way like small corridors and buzzsaws or gattling guns on the walls that spray bullets at random intervals.Overall I think you should buy this game if you like endless platforming challenge as well as your own custom levels and community made levels9/10			",185,24,9,9,7,0,3

			Half Lets play, half review, all awesome. 20 minutes of game offers the ultimate tool for you the consumer to decide if you want to buy the game. Want gameplay? Check. Want a review score? Check.		

Today, I take a look at Just Get Through, a deceptively fun indie platformer that features fully destructible environments. The levels start short an simple, but the farther you progress the more difficult the game makes the randomly generated path. The steam record holder has only made it to level 63, but I can only make it to level 34. At first the game looks drab in black in white, but Just Get Through features multiple color pallets that you can unlock by playing through the game.It also features several unique and gamechanging modes, such as night mode, hardcore mode, speedrun mode, classic run, seeded run, and a few others. It also has fully featured level editor where you can create custom levels to share with your friends.. The devs, Retrific games, are still regularly updating the game. I thoroughly enjoyed doing this review, and I hope you enjoy the game.That being said, as in my video review, I request that the right analog trigger emulate the mouse for throwing dynamite while playing on a gamepad.Thank you Retrific for this game, and you did an awesome job making the game shine.

												Incredibly fun game. I haven't even gotten to level 20 yet after a few hours of gameplay, but because it's randomly generated I never seem to get bored. If you're a fan of platformers of any kind, this game is for you.			",183,52,1,8,14,1,12

												This game reminds me alot of ""1001 Spikes"", but I like this better. What I liked about this game: - Classic mode was easier than ""1001 Spikes"", making it more enjoyable to play - Hardcore mode for when you need more of a challenge - Randomly generated levels (depending on your game mode - some have a fixed seed) - Leaderboards - Level editor - User submitted levels - Assorted other modes to play: Coin rush, daily run, fixed seed run, speed run, etc			",617,205,19,76,98,6,101

												You enjoyed Super Meat Boy: you like platformers requiring a tight-control, and you can endure when the game punishes you for every mistake you make by kicking you back to the start point.Then you'll enjoy this.- You can destroy some part of levels by TNT, but the amount is limited.- You have HP in this game, but it doesn't mean you can endure damages, rather mean the amount you can retry the level from the start/check point after a damage you've taken.Don't like a hard platformer? Then it's not your cup of tea.			",248,77,11,18,24,4,31

												I personally love this game, I've had it for a week and play it daily. To anyone who feels like they want a nice and casual game to play, I highly suggest this game, and reccomend it to anyone. I'm not the only one I know who enjoys this. I told my friend about this game and had him download it and he enjoys it too. And one unforgettable thing about this game though, the rage. The only thing I find bad about this is it is possible to come across something nearly impossible to pass without tyring to think about how to pass for a while. 8/10 would reccommend.

												Just Get Through is easily one of the best platforming games I've ever played. It's fun, and easy and challenging at the same time - depending on how the level was generated (or the game mode).The randomised levels in the classic mode make the game even funnier to play, as you don't know exactly what kind of difficulties you will face in your playthrough. The colour palettes and the different game modes also make it more interesting - the latter adding objectives too.Overall, I do really recommend this game - especially at this price!

												As fun as it is frustrating Just Get Through is a helll of a ride. The randomly generated trap-filled levels mean that every playthrough is different. And you will find yourself getting far to excited about unlocking a new colour scheme for the game. With a good mix of challenging game modes it keeps things fresh. If you want to see me attempting to play the game and my rage building to eyewatering levels check out the episode I recorded in this game for my Indie Kick! series:

												It isn't funny at the beginnig, but after a few levels it gets interesting, and you just can't stop playing. Overall is not too much difficult, just in a few occasions you can find situations where a lot of skill is required. The graphics are interesting and quite original, and the soundtrack seems really good to me.Love the Custom levels feature and the colorpalettes variety, though some of them look awful. If you like platform games, you won't regret buying this one, since the procedurally generated levels feature gives you a new experience in every single game, if you don't, well, there's nothing that can attract you in this game.

			A fun precision platformer full of tricks and traps with randomly generated, fully destructable levels. Technical elements I neglected to mention: There are no resolution options, but it seems to...		

The GoodA marriage of Super Meat Boy and Spelunky if they met on the Gameboy Color. A fun precision platformer full of tricks and traps with randomly generated, fully destructable levels. Light character-progression offers a diet rogue-lite meal. Includes a level editor and in-game level browser full of clever user-generated content. Daily and weekend runs. Lots of game modes that offer a twist for everybody. Steam leaderboard support, tight responsive controls, and thrilling gameplay.The BadSome of the collectible palletes in the game are downright ugly. I wish there was a way in-game to see what palette is in use and disable it from the rotation without guessing from the endless pages in the main menu. Finding ""broken"" palettes (ugh). There is little 'push' for the player beyond competing against your own scores or on leaderboards, so you must be score-driven to get the most out of this arcade platformer beyond a certain point.The EndWall-jump and blast your way through treacherous traps and roaming robots in a series of procedurally generated, fully destructable platforming dungeons. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Each week I do an Indie Game of the Week on my youtube channel and this week was dedicated to this title.  I review each title in six different categories.  Gameplay, Graphics, Immersion, Random, Replayability, and Sound.  I then take the scores of each category and average them to come up with the overall review.  You can watch the video attached for a full description, but here are the bullet points.Gameplay:   The only real complaint I have here is the odd control scheme chosen for the level designer.  There are far better ways to layout the controls for that section of the game.  Otherwise the controls were on par and required no tutorial for me to pick up and play easily.  I love the nature of the procedurally generated levels that progressively get harder as you play.  Graphics:  The colors make this game very difficult on the eyes at times.  The grey starting color palette is horrible and after an hour of gameplay I have only unlocked two color palette's.  Neither of which were upgrades over the grey starting palette.  Immersion:  I didn't lay awake at night thinking about this game like others I have played.  I found this game to be a good stress reliever, but it did not suck me in and make me care about my character in any way.  I just start over when he dies with no real emotion attachment.  I expected that from this game though.Random:  The random element was how addicting the game is.  Again, I did not lay awake at night thinking about this game and I have not had a strong desire to play the title.  It is a great way to kill a few minutes in between meetings, but not something that will cause a divorce.Replayability:  This game has an amazing score for replayability.  The procedurally generated levels make this game different every time you play.  Throw in the fact that there are literally hundreds or thousands of community generated levels makes this game replayable to no ends.Sound:  The sound was on par.  There are a few annoying sound loops that happen when there is a moving object like a rock rolling or a bot moving, but overall the sound was on par with this type of game.  You'll have to watch the video for my official score in each category, but overall I gave this a 3.6 out of 5 with the potential to reach a 4.0 with a few minor fixes and tweaks.

												Super Meat Boy meets roguelike.In Just Get Through you play as a dude who gets lost in a ancient temple and needs to escape it by going through portals while evading deadly traps. As you get further the levels get longer and harder, introducing new types of traps, and every few levels you can upgrade your character.The gameplay is pretty simple - you can run around, sprint, wall jump and throw dynamite. You can use it to destroy traps and create a faster way to the exit, but you need to be carefull - if you're careless with the explosives, you can find yourself unable to complete the level.Just Get Through offers a variety of different game modes, for example the classic one where you need to get as far as you can, night mode in which the levels are dark and you need to use torches and flares or coin run in which you can pick up money and spend it at certain spots.Levels are randomly generated, but there's also a level editor. If you prefer hand made levels you can find a big variety of user created ones to play.Summary+well made platformer+endless amount of randomly generated levels+a lot of game modes+level editor and levels made by users-simple graphics (but they have their charm)-frustrating at times8.5/10			",124,20,1,16,21,1,16

												This is an acceptable platformer roguelike, The biggest problems with it are:- the motion sickness inducing shaking that seems to come with almost every action- The lack of color until you can find a color palette in a chest, the game reminded me of DLC quest in a bad way...- The poor design for the level RNG generator. half the level can serve no purpose at times, sometimes checkpoint flags can be right next to the start or end points, etc... The TNT seems like a cheap way to cover up for the weaknesses of the level generator.The game is however worth its price. As such, I can just barely recommend this for fans of Rogue Legacy and/or Tallowmere who are looking for something new. 6.5/10			",199,32,4,3,2,0,17

												Yet another game that highlights how much steam DESPERATELY needs a neutral/average rating option but seeing as this game is given mostly praise and this review is mostly criticisms i will go with not recommend.With that being said i kind of like this game...............well at least i would if it did not have a couple of fatal flaws.For the most part i feel most of the problems were well addressed by reviewer/steam account Cyril, however what was not addressed was the amount of lag in this game which is very likely the cause of some of these problems. This is the kind of game which ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT have any kind of lag to be enjoyable.I have a pretty good computer especially for a game with these kinds of graphics so it is extremely unlikely to be my computer that is the cause.As the the levels progressed (and more items/obstacles were loaded) it became more apparent that the problem was lagAltough some of the mechanics are a bit wonky (particularly jumping and wall jumping) it would not be such of a problem  if it were not for the lag.As it stands now i just can not recommend it until that problem is fixed.

												It's a randomly generated easier super meat boy with a limited number of retries and after level perk unlocks.			",153,22,2,25,3,0,4
