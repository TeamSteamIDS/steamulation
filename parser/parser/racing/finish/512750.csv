								I went into this expecting nothing but pleasantly surprised. Essentially you use your hands to boost around the moon like Iron Man using your hands (with directional control and thrust of each hand) and shoot missiles at asteroids. It’s a good start for $3.99.  I don’t think this is a good game for those new to VR.  While I had no problem, I suspect it will be very disorienting for newbies.Issues\recommendations for developer:- You must use a mouse or keyboard to select play outside of VR.  Fix this ASAP. I was waiting around in VR for the game to start.- The first level was ok but I could not figure out where to plant the flag. It just kept swapping hands. - Ramp up game play. The first level was almost too easy but I gave up before finding all 12 asteroids on the 2nd level. - Give us a HUD/map   - Multiplayer could be awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One Giant Leap is a fun little game with nice visuals and audio. The game is basicly flying through courses on the moon with the same “iron man” lokomotion as also seen in HVR and Richie’s Plank Experience. While some of the early missions might be a little dull, the real fun is with the Force Flight missions. Here you’ll fly through boosters that throws you across the moon while you’re avoiding (or exploiting) black holes. Once again it’s a small game so don’t expect hours of content here. But for 3.99$ it’s definitely worth trying out.			",113,33,4,2,21,2,3

								The locomotion in this game is perfect! Lack of actual game aside the movement alone could be adopted to create amazingly fun game. Dear dev, I know you are probably a 1 man team but if you could see your way to adding more to the  game that would be fantastic and worth a premium price.-Flag does not place as some people have already pointed out.Suggestions.Enemies to fight, new weapons, buildings to explore, bigger maps, capture the flag mode (and multiplayer)Coop with missions, caves, some kind of character progression and persistance, loot and leveling. Add all that and you will end up with a best selling game I could happily pay £30 for.			",412,66,17,28,42,2,43

								Great new locomotion method - a good sense of vast open space, and enjoyable game mechanics.No nausea, this game is a pleasure to play!			",69,15,0,2,15,2,2

								This is pretty awesome.  The first time I've seen this type of movement with VR used.  Almost fell over a couple of times.  Amazing!			",46,21,0,6,12,1,8

								One Giant Leap utilizes my favorite new from of locomotion. The booster jets' physics feel nice and smooth, and it does a great job of making the sensation of flying fun. Opposed to at least 95% of the other VR demos I've tried out so far, this one is unique in the way that you feel free to move around, rather than being confined to a certain room size. Beyond the locomotion, the game is of course not extremely feature-filled, giving that it's an early-access demo. The modes it does have in place, however, definitely do an adequate job at letting you play around with the locomotion in a more arcade-like fashion, adding replayability. The rockets are satisfying to shoot and destroy the various asteroids with. I noticed another reviewer found himself getting motion sickness and stuttering, but I personally had no problems with this.Overall, definitely pick this up! Just for the experience of the booster jets I'd say its worth it, especially considering that it is an early-access game, with more in-depth features sure to come. Might as well snag it while its in early access for a lower price imo!			",62,6,2,10,11,2,13

								I have been waiting for a solid space/moon experience on the Vive, and this one hit the nail on the head for me. The locomotion using the booster jets is extremely smooth and feels perfectly natural. I didn't experience any motion sickness - my brain was convinced I was flying around on the moon. It was so immersive, that I spent the first 15 minutes just wandering around the terrain before even attempting the first 'course'. Although there are only a few things to do right now, it's enough to justify the price and (IMO) they are challenging enough to bring me back to beat my times. The last asteroid one is definitely a challenge to track them all down, but it became much easier when I realized you can turn on the ""highlight"" which shows you where they all are. I'm running the bare minimum VR-recommended hardware specs, and this game played beautifully for me.Dev, I hope you continue to put time into this and give us a few more courses to tackle. This game is one of the reasons I wanted VR. Great job, keep it up!TL;DR - This is a very pleasant experience floating around on the moon, well worth the price of admission.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For just four bucks this is really great fun. Movement and controls are awesome, the graphics are cool, you really feel like you are on the moon (I can tell this, because I know, of course :-) )The shooting is not yet perfect, though: When you move, the rockets drift away, because the dev forgot to add the vectors of your movement and the movement of the rockets themselves (as they are shot by a moving 'ship'), so it feels like they are drifted by strong wind. Maybe a laser gun woud be better to simply avoid this issue.But anyway, once you are in this game, you really understand what VR is for. This on a flat screen would not make sense.We played it with the whole family and the kids (6 and 8) still struggle with the controls but everyone enjoys hoovering arround. And of course I am hunting best times, which is quite challenging.So compliments to the dev and a clear recommendation to buy. It is a lot of fun per dollar. ",78,25,8,3,13,0,1

								I'm guessing because of the motion sickness issue (to which thankfully I'm not prone), there's a shortage of flying games in VR. This one is well done, and well worth the four bucks.			",53,25,6,0,28,4,3

								This game was really fun. It was one of the first VR experiences were I freaked out a little bit when I lifted off the ground. It can be a little nauseating when you hit the ground but feel no physical impact, but that can't be avoided at this point in haptic technology. Definitely worth a download!			",17,7,3,0,4,1,0

								Never though i would experience something like that. This game delivers on it's promise. Solid mechanics, solid graphics, runs well on my GTX 1070 with some supersampling enabled. The moment that totally sold me on this game was when i picked up some kind of rave gun laying in some random place which replaced the rocket launcher for shooting asteroids. I had WAY too much fun flying over moon craters, constantly firing that rave gun popping out techno tunes in form of vibrant laserorbs while the whole scenery flashes in intense colors like some kind of rave party. Good job.Beware of your body though, i couldn't help twitching when hitting the virtual ground too hard. My brain is still adapting to VR i guess.			",241,78,3,25,71,4,60
