												A cheaper version than City Car Driving .It's fun to drive , of course you will encounter some bugs but the game is funYou have a good selection of cars , around 16 i guessSome mission or tutorial if you wantAn endless highway where you can do what you wantGraphics are more than ok for a 4 euro gameOverall i recomend this game			",211,62,21,21,34,9,20

												it's clearly a simulator... not just average driving game, I made a lot of errors from start hehe...tho it need a bit of polish true... for example grass generating on the middle of concrete where you drive and small bugs like that. oh I strongly recommend to buy wheel for this game, because keyboard and gamepad... won't help you a lot... plus almost every key on keyboard have function, tho overall enjoyable game			",94,24,3,13,6,0,9

												Drive Megapolis is a game that I can't recommend because:- it's not worth the money- it has lots of bugs- it is very laggy- it is not unique- the controls are horrible- the graphics aren't that good- it has no sense- the only good reason to install this game is for the trading cards			",730,198,37,78,65,12,74

												Why is everyone hating on this? It's legit a straight rip off of City Car driving. A currently as of 22 January 17 is £15+ on steam. This game is £0.59p as of 17/1/17. It works with my G920 wheel, and is pretty fluid with a slight bit of lag at the start but ends after 30 seconds as the game is loading in. I've had no issues with running this game, the menu isn't too good to say the least, but i've seen much worse for £10+ games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a bad simulator for $4. Graphics are actually pretty nice, the physics are a little wonky and the main menu is a bit confusing, but I think its an overall good game for the price. Give it a try if you think it looks intersting.			",1585,464,27,170,133,10,126

												I cannot use my Logitech wheel, so what good is a driving game when you have to use a keyboard. Without the wheel this game is useless. It would be nice if I can get my money back! Please don't buy this game if you want to use it to learn to drive or practice, it is useless. Sorry but that's the way it is.			",0,0,12,0,2,0,0

			The game takes forever to load and the Framerate is not great. There seems to be an attempt to make a realistic simulator to introduce newbies to driving. It fails spectacularly on most counts.
