												Really fun, cheap, indie platformer with a great nostalgic soundtrack. Decent challenge on the higher difficulties too.			",226,35,6,33,13,1,8

												Metal Slug lookalike with awesome techno music plus splendid cartoon artwork. A little short though, finish it in about 1 hour.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all: This game seems to be a mobile port. There's a controls menu, but instead of telling you to press spacebar to jump and the left mouse button to shoot (which is everything you do in this game) it only tells you to touch.The game was fun in the beginning but it got repetetive really quickly. You aim, shoot, sometimes jump over a gap and that's it. Most enemies don't do anything besides flying towards the left-hand side of the screen and often you don't even have to shoot because they wouldn't hit you anyway, but of course you want some points. I never died because of the enemies, I only died because I fell down a gap while shooting at things for points.There are some really nice-looking bosses. But seriously, what's the point of them? They sometimes spawn a small enemy or shoot a cannonball at you - you can destory the cannonball with a single hit - and that's it. You can even disable the weapons by shooting at them. The bosses are easier than the rest of the game because they don't throw gaps and enemy swarms at you.I stopped during stage 4-2 because it was exactly the same thing as in 1-1, except for the multitude of gaps that made my keep dying. Oh, did I mention that minutes of shooting at small enemies isn't challenging or fun and that there are no checkpoints?Seriously, Trigger Runners has some great ideas and it can be fun for 30 minutes, but that's it.

												Not a bad game, but neither is good. An experience so simple (because it's meant to be played in movile devises) that really doesn't make an efford to stand out. Bland narrative, mediocre graphics, tedious bullet-sponge bosses. There isn't even a scoreboard implemented and the game dificulty levels feel the same, it really doesn't have replay value. In the other hand, the price tag is fair.			",427,90,10,19,20,5,39

												Trigger Runners is a simplistic infinite runner game with a nice art style. It's an obvious mobile port because in the control menu it only tells you touch controls, not left mouse button to aim and shoot or spacebar to jump. The music and chimes are extremely annoying, thankfully there is a mute button. The game is fun for a bit, but quickly becomes repetitive and boring. There are boss fights at the end of each stage which should liven things up but they are way too easy. It's a mobile port that should remain on mobile. I got it a bundle, wouldn't buy it outright I'd go play it for free!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Headphone users, beware.  Somewhere in the menu screen is an ear-splitting high-pitched chime that made me yank out my headphones.The game keeps track of your bullet precision and scores you accordingly.  In a shoot-em-up runner, I don't find this to be an enjoyable mechanic.  It creates a feeling of taking a test rather than enjoying a game.			",958,520,18,162,101,13,168
