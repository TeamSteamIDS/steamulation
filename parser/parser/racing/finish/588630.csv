								A nice funny game with a lot of potential... I realy enjoyed Draw Rider 1. What this game needs is: Character customisation ; A Steam Workshop for community content (for example selfmade characters and Levels to keep things fresh) ; maybe Checkpoints in some levels that are hard to master ; AND whats realy importent: LEVELS to keep people interested, maybe you can add a litle more with every update.  Pumped to see whats coming out in the future <3			",32,1,2,0,6,0,0
