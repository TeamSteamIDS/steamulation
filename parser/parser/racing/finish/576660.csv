												What a crap... don't get me wrong, the idea is good - google Achtung! Die Kurve, but this game? nothing original, ugly, boring.			",1879,738,47,236,166,24,257

												It doesn't work at all. So don't buy it right nowWill probably update when it does.EDIT: We got it working. If it freezes for you need to install Directx manually in the game folder. Or you can just play in windowed mode (F4). Game is very fun to play with friends :)			",10,0,1,0,1,0,0
