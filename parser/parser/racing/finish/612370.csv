Early Access Review
								After having played Pako - Car Chase Simulator, I knew I had to give Pako 2 a try. With a slightly different concept to the game, it feels much like it's original, while still being unique enough to be it's own game. The controls have been changed, from having a non-stop moving car to having a car that you can control yourself. The weapons have also changed, whereas before you had to pick up ammo off the ground and only shoot it in 1 direction, you are given a gunman who will continuously shoot in the direction of your choosing, either with the mouse or right thumbstick, both of which feel good.The basics of the game has also changed. In Pako, you simply had to survive for as long as possible while avoiding pretty much everything in the environment, as 1 hit meant you were done. In Pako 2, you get more freedom when it comes to your vehicle blowing up, and can take a few hits before you lose. The premise is also different, as now you must help robbers escape while having cops run after you. I really enjoyed that they added a reason for running away, instead of simply ""survive"", it's become more of a ""help these people out WHILE you survive"". It adds a bit of random-ism as well. In Pako, you could simply keep doing a loop around the map until you lost, skipping entire sections of map even. In Pako 2, it forces you to explore everywhere and try out new routes in order to escape the cops.Overall really fun game, even if it is still in Early Access. The devs are super active on Twitter and they're constantly posting new teasers and screenshots as well as answering questions thrown at them. Definitely worth the buy for those that are looking for a cheap fun game to play!If you would like to see some gameplay, as well as my first look/thoughts on the game, you can check out my video over on my YouTube channel here:

			Playing some Pako 2 for the first time after it's release! Pako 2 is still in early access, but it's looking very good so far.

								Gotta love the graphics and the VHS-effects.There's a bug with mouse crosshair, it disappears 70% of the time, makes gaming difficult.Will play after the fix. Keep up the good work!			",44,12,1,3,7,0,10
