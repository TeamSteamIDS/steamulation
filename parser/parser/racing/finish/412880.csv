 ENG REVIEW(NOT REVELANT)  Review updated! 02.05.16 Is there a lot of games of drifting on a pc?-NO!Being a big fan of the drift culture, I really liked this game,The game is already very playable! Positive things: -Support for mods-Track editor-Each engine has its own sound-Good music-NotBad physics (physics Corrected, it is difficult to drift, now I feel like a cow on ice)-Ability to swap engines (Where you still saw it on the PC except in the old good SLRR?)-Balancing car-Engine tuning-Adjusting camber, eversion of the wheels and the offset of wheels-A good number of cars (or Rather 22 which as for me is enough)-External tuning (Wheels, Wheels Painting, body Painting, body Kits (Body kits are available on Silvia 13, Hachiroku,14 Silvia and Mark 90 only))-Multiplayer (Separate servers to 16 slots, It is also possible to create your own server) Defects: -Unity Engine-Few maps (8)-Civic, what he is doing here, he is front-wheel drive? OO-Not very comfortable speedometer (IMHO) All What I would like to see in the game:	-Toyota Chaser-BMW E30-BMW E34-BMW E39-Painting of individual parts of the car in your color-Ability to put different wheels on the front and the rear of the car-The size adjustment of the speedometerThat's AllP.S. My English isn't so good, You can report about mistakes in the review on my wall :3 For all your questions about the game I will answer on the wall in the STEAM, so make sure that it is open to ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE  RUS REVIEW(НЕ АКТУАЛЬНО, Я ЛЕНИВАЯ ЗАДНИЦА, СКОРО	 КОГДА-НИБУДЬ ОБНОВЛЮ ОБЗОР)  Обзор обновлен! 02.05.16г	Много ли есть игр про дрифт на pc?-НЕТ!Являясь ярым фаном дрифт культуры, мне очень приглянулась данная игра,Игра сырая, но уже очень играбельна! Плюсы:	-Поддержка модов-Редактор треков-Завезли графончик, на 20.04.16г графон еще немного подтянули-Почти у каждого двигателя свой звук -Частые обновления	 Частыми обновлениями нас перестали радовать :с-Неплохое музыкальное сопровождение-Неплохая физика (Поправили физику, сложно дрифтить, теперь чувствую себя коровой на льду)-Возможность свапа двигателей (Где вы еще это видели на PC кроме как в старом добром SLRR?)-Балансировка авто-Тюнинг двигателя-Регулировка выворота, развала и вылета колес-Хорошее количество авто (А если точнее 22 чего как по мне вполне хватает)-Внешний тюнинг (Литье, Покраска литья, Покраска кузова, Обвесы (Пока только на Сливу 13, на Хачироку,14 Сливу и Марк 90 который я так ждал))-Мультиплеер (Появились отдельные сервера на 16 слотов, соответственно появилась возможность создать такой сервер) Минусы:	-Движок (Никогда не любил юнити)-Мало карт (Всего 8) -Мультиплеер (Почему мультиплеер и в плюсах и в минусах? Потому что он плохо реализован, кто играл тот поймет, но его присутствие это явный плюс)	 -Mark II...ПОЧЕМУ ИМЕННО СОТКА?! ДАЙТЕ НАМ НАШ ДЕВЯНОСТИК! А ЕЩЕ НУЖЕН ЧАЙЗЕР!	-Сивик, что он тут вообще делает он же переднеприводный? Оо -Слишком большой	 Неудобный спидометр (ИМХО) -Иногда камера ведет себя неадекватно  Камеру поправили То что хотел бы видеть в игре:	 -Оптимизацию))0)))000))		 -Mark II JZX90	-Chaser JZX90-BMW E30-BMW E34-BMW E39 -Nissan Silvia S14 (Ранее покоривший мое сердце)	-Покраску отдельных частей авто в свой цвет-Полный тюнинг авто как внутренний так и внешний-Возможность ставить разные диски на переднюю и заднюю часть авто (возможно я один такой извращенец))0)))000)))-Регулировку размера спидометра -Ну и возможность создавать лобби для игры только с друзями(Возможно такое уже есть просто я этого не знаю)	Вроде бы все.P.S. Знаю что Д0XY9| хочу но всеже) На все заданые вопросы под обзором, отвечаю вам на стену в стиме, так что убедитесь что она открыта АБСОЛЮТНО ВСЕМ для комментирования!	Игру рекомендую всем!

												UPDATE v2 AS OF THIS POST I WAS PERMANENTLY BANNED FROM THE DSJ FORUMS FOR REVEALING THIS INFO BY JDM HIMSELFhttp://puu.sh/ooDLr/88d0b2461d.pnghttp://puu.sh/ooDLr/88d0b2461d.pnghttp://puu.sh/ooDLr/88d0b2461d.pngUPDATE: THE GRAPHICS UPDATE AND *NEW PHYSICS* AND ""TOUGE"" MAP ARE ALL JANKUM.THE MAP IS STOLEN FROM ASSETTO CORSA, THE GRAPHICS UPDATE IS HIGHER RESOLUTION TEXTURES STOLEN FROM A DIFFERENT GAME ENGINE WITH CRANKED REFLECTIONS AND THE PHYSICS ARE THE LEAST FLUID OF ALL THE UPDATES AND MAKE IT FEEL LIKE A DSJ RIP-OFF IF THAT WERE EVEN POSSIBLE0/10 IGN - Who the ♥♥♥♥ made this pile of ♥♥♥♥?0/5 GameSpot - Worst waste of 7 dollars since that time I tried meth1/10 NextGenTactics - Polished Turd.I've been one of the biggest initial supporters of this game, and I was one of the people to help it thrive as much as it did. I can say that it was once a good game, but due to recent updates and recent events I no longer support the creator or the game.Drifting physics and controller support got very glitchy as of the miata addition, (A car that has been in the game files from day 1 wouldn't break the game)I was forum banned for no proper reason, see here; https://steamcommunity.com/app/412880/discussions/0/412449508291314237/JDM - Games creator says ""Ignore people like modnar"" do you agree?I digress there, relevant info to the game hereThe handling and controls are rather intuitive and easy for people to catch on early, however they become a problem and an annoyance down the road as it prevents you from controlling your car 100%, and they fight you in a similar fashion to nfs 2016's controls.The car list would be more impressive if all of the cars hitboxes and horsepower capabilities weren't all the same, the only differences in the cars being I believe there's 1 FWD mixed in, look out.Oh, and transmission gearings kind of make them different in-game SOMETIMES so that counts for something.All of the car models are blatantly ripped off from other games, notice how the models are flipped now? And on top of that the real car names were even used, remnants of this exist in the files and you can see it in regedit as well if not on the badges on the cars themselves.The ""body kits"" update was okay, the rim update was lackluster but I didn't complain. The steady stream of new maps, cars, and general content was good for the first month or so.Until people began to abuse broken code, change colours and glitch it out to the extent it would leave assorted coloured bubbles on your screen on the lens flare and other shadows and reflections about the map effectively making it impossible to play, gross impossible cambers, the disabling of collision (and they can still throw you around without collision too!) and addition of thousands of horsepower to ones vehicle.And then the updates halted, only to be seen once every 2-3 weeks with the addition of broken code and features that didn't really do anything. People began to quit, certain issues made the game unplayable for some and too difficult to figure out for others. This is where I came in, if people had problems, they came to me. I had over 100 players at any given time from DSJ on my list, and I couldn't go an hour without helping someone with something DSJ related whether it be in a private message on steam, or one of the hundreds of forum posts and threads on the official game or steam forums separately (Lots of em)I got people together for big drift events, did a ton of recordings with the community, and just rallied together support for it and hyped up every little update despite the circumstances while still running FREE tech support (the updates ♥♥♥♥ing sucked and were broken, look you can tell)Still JDM refuses to address the big bugs and it's been almost a month, if not so already since he broke the game in a bad way. He claims to have all this work done, well let's see it. You rolled out new content like it was a fancy carpet at first, what happened?TL:DR; I helped fix controllers and peoples games, and I got forum banned, all posts deleted and im :steamsalty:Used to be a really good game with a lot of potential until russian updates			",80,3,8,0,5,0,2

												First of all, let me preface this review by declaring that racing games are not my strength or favorite and I am an imbecile when it comes to car mechanics & terminology. I can barely change the oil in my own car so when it comes or horsepower, torque etc... I am clueless.With all that being said I actually enjoyed this game much more than I thought I would!While I found myself dead last in most of the races it was still fun. Controls were easier to pick up than I was anticipating and I was drifting in no time. As you would expect, there is an emphasis on drift mechanics with scoring multiplyers applied on how well you do it.Graphics are good with crisp, sharp outlines to the vehicles.The only drawbacks for me subpar audio/music and the lack of useful in-game settings menu.Was a fun ride but I'll stick to my strengths. Recommended for those into the racing genre.			",3193,1303,130,383,459,41,537

												PROOF ONE OF THE TOUGE MAPS IS STOLEN: http://assettocorsa.club/mods/tracks/akina-downhill.html Does this look familiar?[SERIOUS REVIEW ABOUT THE GAME AND ITS HISTORY. TL;DR AT BOTTOM.]This game used to be great, it had so much potential. Infact my original review stated ""The best $7 you would ever spend""DSJ was first getting off the ground, people were doing lets plays of it. JDM4iK suddenly had a way bigger follower base on the game.At the time, the game had great physics and a lot going for it. It was recieving regular updates with original content. It all went downhill from there.There was an MX-5 model in the game, and it was ready for release. It wasn't released until several updates later. Before that, there was: A track being changed into day, a multiplayer system, and chat.Ever since the chat system came out, it got worse. People were doing drag races, and blocking roads. Multiplayer got boring. Less updates were happening, less news was coming out.There was a physics update which made drifting a lot harder and a lot less realistic. The MX-5 update came out, with even more broken physics than before.As of this post, the update simply stole a map from Assetto Corsa and made physics unuseable.During the course of all of this, the community wasn't listened to one bit, and was permabanned for trying to speak up about all this going on.Before, I would have said you should buy this game. Now? I think it's just not worth it anymore.3/10. Stolen content, very broken physics, most of the real players have given up on the game.TL;DR: This game used to be the best driving game ever. Now it's just some horribly designed mashup of stolen maps and models. The community isn't listened to, and when someone points out something bad they get permabanned from everything.

												Fun game that has potential but needs some work.This games drifting physics are nice but its braking mechanics need work, you can't even slow down with engine braking by down shifting witch really bothers me, also your speed wil remain constant and not drop from coasting.Some tire and grip tunning mechanics would be nice as well for the various maps such as the freeway so you're not sliding all over the place too hard.Other then that this game is fun and i enjoy it, it just needs some more work.

												Used to be fun when it came out, then they changed the physics completely and added tuning. Now the tuning is gone and its just bad physics. You cant even drift anymore, the car either just slides and you crash or it turns and you crash. Game seldom gets updates and when it does, its nothing major. Tried playing it today after not playing for a while because I missed how fun it was, but was just disappointed.			",148,4,8,1,5,0,1

												I want to, but I can't reccomend Drift Streets Japan. It has nice car models. It has beautiful touge maps. But it's not fun to play. The physics can work but they feel...strange more often than not and the progression is ungodly slow with few things to break up the monotony. It's not 'realistic' enough to be a simulator but it's also trying to avoid being 'arcade' and doesn't really accomplish much.The options for graphics, gameplay, and controls are poor. This game looked a lot funner when it was released. I decided to give it some time to bake before picking it up in a sale, and I guess it baked too long and got burned. I hope one day it's nice again. I will change my review if that becomes a thing.I do really like the touge maps though. I was just hoping for something a little more like a modern IDAS.

												A good time waster for fairly cheap for someone who is into the japanese car community.+Game is getting updated very often (update every 2 days)+Car performance leveling/upgrading+Car power graphs+Adjustment of camber/offset tires-Broken/very horrible brakes-Cars are too slidey-The slightest collision with anything will end your point streak(even the ground!)+/- Multiplayer, but only one map. Haven't tired LAN mode yet.+Multiplayer freedom, you can drift/cruise with your friends with no objectives/limits while still earning money for drifting.+Good selection of iconic japanese tuners with more being added very often.+Engine swaps, which are ♥♥♥♥ing cool.I'd like to see an option to disable drift handling for just cruising around with friends and improved brakes(takes 10 seconds to stop completely from 150km/h).

												Every positive review is either a lie or by someone with absolutely no taste in games.  The gameplay and controls are garbage.  Gameplay consits of tapping left and right to slide about in the most simple way, you don't actually control the car just suggest which direction you want your car to spin, you don't have to touch the brakes ever and the car countersteers for you.  Braking will cause your car to actually lift into the air, never in a game have I seen a one ton car pull a stoppie.  Also, going around a corner is nigh impossible because of these problems if you're going more than 20kph(thats 12mph).  Also toss in the horrible graphical glitching that seems to occur constantly I just dont get why this has such a high rating.  Avoid.			",478,123,10,100,39,2,56

												Don't get me wrong, this is a fun game and I like it but the developer is now working on another game (That looks the same as this one, except it's about racing, not drifting) and has abandoned this one.

												No brakes simulator 2016.Bad-Physics suck out loud. Tap a wall? Welcome to NASA.-If your drifting try and use the e-brake or reg brake they always seems to instantly make the car go straight but not do anything to slow you down. -At speed the car basically refuses to turn.-It's been said in other reviews but no engine braking/ car stays at the same speed even off the gas. -Tracks look and feel like crap. overly bumpy. Kind of like all the terrain is made from flat pieces stacked and rotated. -Keeping the car sideways is basically a tap left and right game. -If it matters to you, your basically ghost riding. No driver in the car. (the steering wheel does turn tho!)-Other then color of the car and rims you can't do anything else to your car. The car tunning is basically camber. You can go stock or full retard both positive and negitive. -Buying an engine swap that comes OEM with a turbo doesn't give you a turbo to start with and engine levels are lower than what they produce in real life. -Mods are pretty basic. Block, head, pistons, intake, exhuast, ecu, turbo and nitrous.-Controller support is a lie. If mines plugged in the car just revs. Can't even switch to keyboard without a restart. -No control map or even a way to view controls. But if you've played NFS carbon the controls are about the same. -Stupidly small detail but your head lights work great! But your tail lights only work when you press the brake.-The money system is pretty simple/odd. No challenges or missions or anything to get money. 10k points = 100 bucks. Good.-Mad skids yo. Not really. I lied.-Cars don't actually look to bad. -in car view/ cockpit view.-Devs seem to be active. More tracks then the game originally launched with already.-Engine swaps. RB26 <3-Steady FPS.Weird? I guess.If you use the latest AMD drivers you may have odd graphical errors. When in the upgrade section the power gains for parts only show as the charts sliding over then aren't visible. But we all know AMD drivers suck. Pretty sure the games an ISO / Andorid port. I'm sure if I bothered to look into it I'd find it on the play store. At this time it's not really worth buying. But active devs, so hopefully all the issues will get sorted soon. But right now the games more annoying than fun. Sorry for the messy review. I hate writing them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Drift Streets Japan is a Drift Simulator/Arcade Racer developed by JDM4iK. The game features various cars and customization for the cars, and to progress you need to drift to earn money.Pros:-Cars models, customization are well detailed for an indie game-Tracks are wonderful, and the track editor makes it possible for players to create even better tracks-Music and sound effects are good and clear.Cons:-Physics feels a bit clunky, it's hard to drift and keep a drift going. Cars have too much traction once you start, but as soon as you go sideways, there is almost no control of the car-Game doesn't really have an objective, you purchase a car, customize it and drift to earn more money to buy more cars and customizationsOverall, this is fun for casual players who just need something to waste time, but based on the physics and non-existent objectives, I can't really recommend it.5/10			",329,107,29,41,36,1,27

												Partial Controller Support actually means half of any controller will function, forum posts suggest that you need to go as far as using Regedit or third-party software for emulated/partial fixes.OC'd 4690k and 7870 couldn't cope with 900p in single player for any map and literally every car feels like it's driving at 10MPH even if stable framerates occur.While it looks nice in the trailers, in-game I can't recommend it, drifting with keyboard controls has to be a joke and botched controllers fixes aren't the same as actual controller support.

												So what i think would be great for the game is when you are tuning a car you should make it so when you upgrade it you inspect things like the motor and it changes when you upgrade it. I personally think you should get some more customization for the car so you can make the car you always wanted as a kid. Add like body customization, window tint, big nice rims and stuff like that.What would be good for online would be that you can choose what map you want to play. And i have noticed that when i play online my fps gets lower and drops more often, i think that is becuase it renders all of the map at the same time instead just a little bit of it. And add so you can talk with people like text press Y. Dont add mics but if you do make it so that you can turn it off in the escape menu so none can annoy you while your drifting. But its worth the money.			",40,2,3,0,11,0,5

												Might have only played at least 1.4 hours on the game, but the gameplay mechanics, and the graphics are amazing, and not to mention you can drift cars. Which is amazing! The game will roughly cost you about £4.99, which I think is a reasonable price for a game like this, but I would like to see more cars, more maps, and more tuning added in the future. If you haven't gotten this game already I recommend you go out, and buy it (If you like cars, and drifting of course.) I would also like to see private servers to play with friends, because when you are online with people they sometimes accidently hit you. Yes this can happen on the private servers to, but in the end you can at least skype your friends, and tell them to go on at a time. I would rate this game 10/10, just because it has potential for the future, and I like cars, and drifting. Upate: The game is normally getting updated every 2 days! Which is some amazing work by the dev's of th game, and or the dev of the game! :)			",137,26,10,12,28,2,4

												I really wanted to like this game. Granted I didn't check out all the features, but the ones I did check out seemed kind of buggy. Rotary swapped my sedan, wanted to check out what exhaust parts were available and blew all my money upgrading and removing without realizing I was spending money. I then picked a map to try and earn some money, and it felt very alone and desolate. Not to mention you earn money pennies at a time, IF you don't tap the edge of the track. Was in the middle of finally holding a drift that was more than just a slalom, and the car flipped into the air and rolled for about 12 seconds. That all said though, I feel this game has potential somewhere down the road.			",139,21,1,15,5,2,3

												It's actually pretty good!  Graphics, physics, it's all here, it's the perfect game!  Or well, part of a game.  It's far from done.  Developer, PLEASE put up an early access banner.  There's no way this is a finished product.  There's no races, events, it doesn't even keep track of anything besides money.  You just slide around in short maps and that's the whole game.  Please, create us new cars, maps, and more things to do!  It's pretty barren right now!

Oh and I see another reviewer stated that the dev is giving out free keys for shill reviews.  I wish I had known!  lol I paid for mine.  http://i.imgur.com/msrcPNs.png  I always like to support indie racing games that are $5-6 brand new.  I am very impressed at this one.  But don't expect more than a slide around simulator.  It's not a whole game.  Oh, and there's no Toyota Supra.EDIT 2016-01-04: There IS a Toyota Supra, now!  Also there are four maps.  And online multiplayer, and controller support.  This developer is patching the game several times per day with huge changes.  It's surely in active development, but the least he could do is put up the Early Access banner.  My frames per second in multiplayer is absolutely horrible.  Maybe in a couple days he can figure that out.  And the controller doesn't work properly, but it was not a feature that previously existed.			",4125,1558,197,486,660,69,658

Good thing is there's enough Japanese cars available, like the famous AE86 and RX-7, as well as my favorite cars Nissan Silvia and Skyline GTR, it's like Initial D, though Akina is obviously unfinished.

												The game is good however, the physics are not what drifting feels at all its terrible. Come on in what world do cars fly when they crash and  how does a car just stop sliding when in a drift at 100KMPH?Wait for updates than buy the game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game suffers from a lot of the same issues that plague the drifting games on mobile, most notably the floaty handling.   It is nearly impossible to go in a straight line, even when none of the wheels have broken traction the car seems to float sideways, as if on ice.  Forget about using a wheel. besides the handling there's decent graphics and cool selection of engines for swaps. They got the right idea but need to fix the physics.			",49,5,9,0,3,1,0

												I have the logitech g920. I hated every minute of it. It worked but the force-feed-back was just not there. you might aswell imagine it in your head and sit there spinning your wheel on your desktop. However the game in itself was not that bad, It's good if you want just a drift game with no realistic physics whatsoever.. But if you do want a drift sim... Assetto corsa, the way forward anyday.

												Drift Streets Japan is a racing game what based at the drifting.In this game is a gameplay is simple enough, at the start you got a some cash, so you should buy a car and ... start drifting! Well at the start I a bit afraided, because the drifting in racing games not my strong side, i never liked drifting tasks in NFS and other games, but this game is surprised me. Drifting here is enough simple, controls are good, so its shouldn't make for you any trouble. In a game you will found a lot of cars what you can buy them if you have enough money, also the customization is very good, the game have enough deep tuning system. The money for tuning or new cars you can earn by drifting, because when you do this you earn points, for example if you earn 70000 points, its equal to 700 dollar.Also in this game you will found a enough maps, track editor, coop and multiplayer feature. The game music is good, well complements the game feeling. The graphic looks very nice, the cars are really has a realistic view.So my verdict+nice graphic+nice music+easy controls+good customization+track editor+multiplayer-no trading cads and steam achievements-""only"" drift maybe can be repetitive Well this game is looks interesting, however there you should only drift its also can bring for you a lot of fun, because this game have a lot of cars, good customization and multiplayer too. So i think if you like racing games you should try this one, especially if its got a good discount. 7/10 ",2101,795,71,247,237,24,306

												Even with updates still feels like a mobile game ported to steam, game is not like other racing simulators on the consoles such as frza and Gran Turismo as far as handling and gripping.Its fun to hop on and do a couple drifts around the track and hop off I honestly do a few 360 drift entries and a lap or two and hop off within 10 mins. Its great for an arcade style of drifting somewhat of how the Need for Speed series is as its not as serious or simulator like for drifting. The brake and hand brake can be glitchy as the creator behind the game tends to mess with it between updates. Feels like the game will be one day abandoned as he is focused on many projects all at once including new ones. It was nice when we had a lobby for many ppl to join and not be restricted to 12/16 but in the end this was a free mobile game ported to steam which i notice costs more than the 6.99 i originally paid. The game lacks real courses has a few cars that are nice to drift with, would be solid if the game had a 1st and 2nd gen rx7.Seems like the courses could be further refines and the track editor is very limiting also you cannot share the track editor online. Customization on the cars is mediocre while the game features a 93 honda civic hatch back with upgrading/swapping a rear wheel drive motor the car still stays front wheel drive making it the only car that can grip in the game. None of the other cars are grippy for grip racing as the game is set up for only drifting. I would recommend it if your a fan of drifitng but i would not pay the current cost of what is being asked for now. Seems like there is a big chance for this game to be abandoned in 2017+ with the mobile need for speed like features.Pros 73 skyline, ae87, fd3s, gtr skyline, 240sx, and japanese carsQuick arcade like drift style good for small amounts of time for boredom Backwards entry, 360 entry, drift point combo multiplyer Quick to pick up if you are used to drifitng on gamesConsDevelopement of levelsMultiplayer limited to 12/16 players "" was unlimited at one point then there was a 64 slot server room later removed ""Akina level is very glitchyTrack editor is limited with little features to use / no capabilities to upload online to shareSometimes upgrades may make your car feel grippier than beforeneeds more refine with controls and more design in levelsBland level designMain menu is simple very mobile game likeHonda civic in a drifting game.... Not even the rare 4wd model, with motor swap civic stays fwd :(Needs a 1st and 2nd gen rx7, 73 celica, mr2, mazda cosmo, nissan fairlady z 91, silvia s13, s14, levin corolla or ae86 coupe corolla, mitsubishi evolution any model any other japanese classic would be nice. Controller support can be hit or miss on some people			",82,2,4,3,3,2,2

												If you are looking for a fun drifting game this is it. Its really fun to play with friends and I enjoy this game so much then i just wanna waste my time, but saddly it looks like devs not really working on this game last update was 3 months ago and it was just reverting old physics. Saddly i have to give dislike because lack of content. Lets start with cars, there are only 3 cars you can tune out of like 12 its really bad. Only 1 car has polished interior which looks hd but others looks so ugly like gta sa fps mod ugly. Ok now lets go with maps. OMG were to start, there are only 2 maps that are made really good others are jsut ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bad. Lets take a map called Akina, road is porrly made going down hill it looks like just plates conected and side rails if you toche them youre car starts flying. I really hope devs woud start working on a game again it but as it now its unpolished, bad, buggy. And I think this is one of those early ascces games that will never be finished. At the position game is at its not worth youre money. Sure grab this game on sale because its not worth 5 Eur. i wanna recommend this game but i cant its porly made like it was rushed.

Product received for free
Title: Drift Streets JapanGenre: Multiplayer, Racing, SimulationDeveloper: JDM4iK Publisher: JDM4iK Release Date: 21 Dec, 2015Introduction: A car enthusiast would be drawn straight to this game, with the positive reviews and mechanics that are said to be the most realistic, and I can say that indeed they are. As soon as I launched the game, the first thing I noticed was that it was not going to be a walk in the park, you could feel the lost of traction as you were spinning out of control after every corner, making it quite heart-racing along side a cliff. Although it will seem hard at first, after a few hours of gameplay, you start to get the hang of it. The customisation is also very thought out, with buying new cars to fine tuning the engine, it really makes you think how to spend your money!Pros: - Hours of fun to be had.- Lots of customisation.- Extremely realistic physics and mechanics.- A reliable developer.Cons:- May be stressful at times.- Are a few bugs. (not game-breaking)- Can yet again become repetitive.Final Thoughts: Overall, this game is perfect for car enthusiasts looking for a bit of fun whilst still having realistic physics & mechanics. You can also hook up a wheel to your computer for the perfect experience.Personal Rating: 8.5/10Thank you for reading through! ",93,15,0,3,3,0,5

												Drift Streets Japan is an illegal street racing game. It's actually a very  good game. What is better than drifting all around Japan. I've always loved tuned cars since I was a kid. I've played many racing games and this game ain't on the top of the list nor in the bottom.The soundtrack is super awesome. Trap and Drift is just perfect. The sound FX is good. The engines sometimes sound strange but everything else is good.The graphics are quite good. The textures are good. The cars, the tracks and the surroundings are detailed. The game's physics is great.The gameplay is very easy. You get used to it in few seconds. The arrows or WASD for movements, Space for Hand breaks, X for clutch, Shift and Ctrl for Shifting, F for repair and C to change the camera. It support Gamepad and Steering wheels well you gotta do some stuff first but it will work out. You can't use the keyboard outside the track which is kinda annoying.The multiplayer is impressive it's really fun to play with you friends. There are lots of cars they all are Japanese tho. C'mon you can't imagine yourself drifting in an Actros SLT oh wait that's a different game.There are eight tracks. They are perfect for Drifting, Driving and Sightseeing.There are lots of ways to tune and modify your car's performance. There ain't many body modifications. Sorry RICERs this ain't a game for you lol.Earning money ain't hard cough in a legit way cough.There ain't a driver so it kinda feels weird at first the same as Burn out Paradise.The cockpit camera is also good but no hands on the wheel <.<If you decreased height of your car it glitches while driving.Changing the colors is also sucks you  need to click ∞ click to find the color you are looking for.It supposed to be an illegal street racing game but there ain't ant cops.There is only options for Audio and video settings. Needs options for key bindings changing the games files is a pain.The game is definitely great. The price is kinda low lol that makes it even better. If you play only in single player mode you will get bored fast so make sure to play with others.I loved it. And I recommend it.If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews.

Wheels work fine, But for the majority of the population with 360 controllers, You are SOL. Requested a refund instantly. Will think about buying again if the dev ads ACTUAL 360 controller support.DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAN TO USE A 360 CONTROLLER			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game (for $8AUD) entirely due to the fact that the promo image contained my real life car (s15), unfortunately the game as of now does not contain a s15 *insert sad face*. Is it worth 8AUD? No. Do i regret buying it? No. *DO NOT LET THE IPHONE STYLE GRAPHICS SWAY YOUR DECISION* the game is extremely addicting particularly due to the drifting physics (Great compared to most simulators, can be a tad better), the inbuilt jukebox(Trap junkies will love it) and the combination of sound effects within each vehicle, Bov's and dose pipes (quite pleasantly) sound exactly as they should in real life and provide me with a sense of immaturity where i build boost and let off the throttle (as i do in real life (; ) resulting with the tickling of my nuts as the glorious sounds of zuTUTUTU222tototo is released. Engine sounds within this game also seem to have been provided effort (SR20s sound like SR20s!!!).in conclusion, if your a car enthusiast (particularly JDM) and you have the money to spare, buy this game to prove to your mates that your not a♥♥♥♥♥♥c-u-nt at drifting as they have called you IRL and redeem your self from the humility you recieved as the sl00ty Gangas and elderly pensioners give you the little finger as you one wheel peel your open diff na sh!tbox around the local Maccas CarPark. *Note to car enthusiasts i believe the R34 is a 25gt-t not a GT-R as seen with the z-tune bodykit hence the RB25 in the car specs tab (makes sense right, drifting game = rwd). Basically think of it as a♥♥♥♥♥♥kient who couldnt afford a GTR but wanted the ganga next door to give him the gobby of his life as her moot quivers in fear whilst in the presence of that fibreglass infested replica virginity taker within his drive way.also if the developer sees this, more tracks (figure 8 plz), more cars like my s15 and ai vehicles could be a little faster and less stupid (like that van who crashes into another van and keeps driving with the van on top of it.)TY TY.

												I was pleasantly suprised... This game is fun.. I gave it a go on my Tx wheel using the th8a shifter and a handbrake...  I didnt expect things to work as well as they did.. There are a few things that I wish worked better or were different , such as when i press the brake iit would be great if it didnt go reverse and the power difference when switching gears are a lil off but i really havent explored weather that is changeable.. One other thing I'd like, when in cockpit view  it'd be nice if the camera didnt turn too far.  But overall, if you have a wheel and just plain love drifting this is a must have for the price.. More drift tracks and cars than I thought going in and it looks like there are a lot of mods to download on DSJ's own website/forum so thats really cool..			",17,1,53,0,23,3,1

												I didnt play this game for long, because almost everything in this game is broken. clutch, brakes, reverse gear, even drifting is broken, and its a DRIFTING game! you get better drift physics and more control in mario cart, then this game. you dont have full control of the car, so drifting fell so weird and broken when using a keyboard. there is almost no customization, besides from a few bumpers, sideskirts, wings and rims. No vinyl, No exhaust, No neon lights, nothing so that you can make a real JDM car. The only thing positive about this game is the sound effects.I hate that i wasted money on this game, so i recommend that you dont waste 5 euros on this game, until the game gets some major updates and more content. its not worth it.I give this game a 2 out of 10, but only because the sound effects are good, but if the sound effects was as broken as the rest of the game, it would be a 1 out of 10.

												this game is so nice, love it, but after this ""downgrade"" it sucks. Id at least like to have grip tuning back. and the fact that i came a week before the next physic update where everyone hated it. (like a month ago) ive adjusted to that one, and all my cars were great, now they all suck, my grip is literally always on ice, and i hate it. can we add an arcade and simulation physics option? for both sides? people who want the ""old januaray"" physics and the update before. Please. Please, take this into consideration			",19,0,8,0,1,0,0

												This game should not be on the steam market. At least as a 5 euro game...maybe free to play will be worth it. It has too much glitches. In the game you earn points for drifting to buy a car or upgrade it , right? What if i told you that you can drive a car and upgrade it even if you did't bought it. You can earn many many many point my going in the track editor mode and just press S and A and you will get millions of coins in minutes. I regret buying this game. Even the speed gauge isn't showing the right speed. One of the worst games out there. Don't waste money on it. Trust me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is not great, i mean like if you got nothing to do and you are looking for a decent drift game you could get games like project cars and the dirt series. This to me with 2 years of drivinggames with a steering wheel (logitech g25) feels like you are sliding accross ice with barely any traction, in real life this would never happen unless you were in a ice ring. i guess if you have nothing to do you can try it but currently there is no controller support meanwhile there is wheel support and h pattern shifter but no ffb in the game, this put the game down for me and now i rate it 3/10.

												-- THIS IS NOT A FANBOY REVIEW -- So I'm going to lists some pros and cons so far into my gaming experience.PROS:+Japanese import cars+PS4 remote compatible( I use Pinnacle Game Profiler ) +The turbo spools+Some drift tracks are okay+The aftermarket parts are cheap+It's easy to make money just by drifting+They have a Toyota Chaser dammit, other game industries should learn from this+Interior is not bad at all, just need minor touching here and there+When in interior mode the driver moves his head left and right when in drift mode and is not stiff.+You can adjust the camber and offset of your car+Music is alright, the list should be more at least but it has potential.+They have mods which is nice ( My favs: Ebisu, Tsukuba etc )+Community is good+Dat price thoCONS:-The car lists can should be more considering some of these cars aren't even licensed. -You hit a wall and your car goes flying in the air like it's zero gravity. -You hit a wall slightly (like a small wall tap) and all of your points is gone.-I don't know what's up with the recent update but the frames are like 14fps on max settings-Some of the cars sound like vacuum cleaner which should be polished a tad bit or at least mess aroundwith the sound editing ( Not the 1JZ it sounds great )-The tracks should be polished a bit as well, there's some invisible walls sticking out on Drift Track 1-There's hackers which needs to be dealt with seriously.-No customization parts for the exterior or interior of the car or able to remove front bumper to expose intercooler.-No neons or strobes which is a bit sad honestly-No in-game vinyls such as itasha, tribal, real life car designs etc-No workshop for this game...like how can you not.-Can barely do a tandem or drift train with somebody without their car lagging back towards you causing it to hit you and then you lose all of your points and everyone elses.-No steam trading cards or achievementsThat's about it honestly. I somewhat recommend this game but it does need a polish on a few areas listed above since there's too many fanboysoverhyping this game. Overall score: 7/10It's not a AAA title like Gran Turismo but it does have potential to fill in the blank spaces GT has left behind on the drift scene that it was capable of.Official review of TeamA99E Drift Warriors -  ドリフト・ウォリアズ			",34,4,2,2,1,0,1

												All of these are rated on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best and 1 being worst.Game play: 7/10 The gameplay takes some getting used to, but when you get the handling down the drifting is fun and the car mods are fun too, although drifting feels like it's on ice.Graphics: 6/10 The graphics are decent, except for cockpit view.Story: N/AMultiplayer Experience: 10/10 This game's community is small, I won't lie about that. But, the community on this game is one of the best communities on any game I've ever played. They're willing to tandem, drag, train, and help you on a moments notice. It is some serious fun.Single player Experience: 8/10 Think multiplayer mode without the people. It gets repetitive.Overall (Average): 7.75/10 This game has a lot of potential and is already a decent game. Some of the best fun you can have for 7 bucks. The devs regularly update it with new content and features. Oh, there's also a track editor, so there goes even more hours of your life. ",99,3,3,2,5,0,0

												ENG:In fact, I car games fan and virtually every aspect of the world most popular driving game for tried-and-play, so still this kind of game has not yet been published ever 3D format and is therefore one of the world's only 3D format playable drifting - car games, where the money can get just drifting.Although a number of car games is the world published and these will be able, if desired, drifting, so these games are not made of just drifting in contrast to this game. By way of separately concluded drifting competitions but these will be isolated. Most car games are usually competitive, or point to point running on stepping stones, so the grip is usually such a key issue as opposed to sliding.The game includes a few tracks and several Japanese brands of cars, which may wish to tune the engine more efficient but, the visual appearance can not be altered until further notice. High testimonials for this game.FIN:Itse olen autopelien fani ja lähestulkoon jokaista maailmassa olevaa suosituinta autopeliä kokeillut ja pelannut niin, silti tämän kaltaista peliä ei ole vielä julkaistu ikinä 3d muodossa ja näin ollen yksi maailman ainoita 3d muodossa pelattavia drifti - autopelejä, jossa rahaa voi saada pelkästään driftaamalla.Vaikka useita autopelejä on maailmassa julkaistu ja näissä pystyy haluttaessa driftaanaab niin, kyseiset pelit eivät ole tehty pelkästään driftaamiseen toisinkuin tämä peli. Poiketen erikseen tehtyä drifting kisoja mutta, nämä ovat yksittäisiä. Useimmat autopeleistä on yleensä kilpailullisia tai pisteestä pisteeseen ajettavia etappeja niin, pito on yleensä näissä avain asia toisinkuin liukuminen.Peli sisältää muutamia ratoja ja useita Japanilaisia automerkkejä, joita voi halutessa virittää tehokkaammalla moottorilla mutta, visuaalista ulkonäköä ei voi muutta toistaiseksi. Korkeat suosittelut tälle pelille.			",452,105,67,38,78,8,80

												Hi! I'm playing this game for some time now. Alot of cool cars, and engines to modify. There is alot of fun playing multiplayer with friends or just random pepole. Only worst thing is that the wheels are just couple of sets and visual car tuning like bumpers, skirts and spoilers. + From me, enjoying this game. Thanks to creators.			",12,5,1,0,0,0,0

												- Good selection of cars.- has a Toyota Chaser/JZX100.- Turbo flutter- A metric F*** ton of negative camber.- Engine swaps and preformance mods. Cons:- Audio could be better.- Random frame drops.- teleporting glitch on Akina.- Lack of car body mods.- Down shifting is a bit odd.Meh:- Rfactor style grahpics, meaning cars have decent res on the outside but the tracks don't.- Controller support is messed up.

												I really want to like this game, but in it's current state.I really cant say I do.1: Lack of content, it's pretty much a paid for early access pre-alpha advertised as a full game, I thought something was odd when it's a 3D game application and the total size was 300mb. I was right.2: Mechanics are incomplete, the physics are off to a nice start, however they are not finished and the braking mechanics are really broken.3: Performance issues dispite having very simple graphics, including little to no foliage and little to no traffic the performance is surprisingly bad.4: Game is themed in Japan but there is no Japanese music or Japanese themed music.Infact the general mastered quality of the soundtrack is prodigiously bad, which is unfortunate when music is so critical to driving immersion.5: Multiplayer is broken, maximum capcity as of this review is 100 players online in 1 server.It does have lan support, if your into Lan parties.If you've an interest in this title, I would advise you wait, add it to your following and see how it develops.Otherwise you will probably be dissappointed if you try it as is.

												This game is fun, however know that it is NOT finished. Besides this updates are being rolled out every day it seems and the game has improved dramatically since it's release. There are a few features I would like to see implimented into the game such as a chat box, players have no way of communicating with each other. Secondly there needs to be some sort of private lobby support, so you can play with your friends without running into other people online. Many people playing in Akina want to twin drift up and down the mountain however you're constantly crashing into other players.Thirdly the crash/bump physics need to be greatly improved, when you bump a barrier or another car you completely stop in your tracks, these pysics are and unrealistic just generally annoying to play with. Another thing I would like to add is the multiplayer needs some optimization, from your point of view other players cars are jumping around everywhere and overall look very buggy.Aside from the negaives this game is getting better everyday and I hope the developers stay focused and listen to their community to make this a great game.

												11/10 IGN BUT...THIS GAME WILL DIE IF CONENT IS NOT ADDED REGULARLY! This has potential to be a top racing game on steam, but dear dev(s), you need to keep adding more conent to keep this game fresh. after a certain number of hours, you have almost mastered the game and you have all the cars that you want. There isnt much more to do after that but drift. I would love for you to add more body modifications to add more depth to the cars, and please find a way to keep people playing so that they will actually go grind for those body kits!

												This game is broken. Filled with stolen assets or unlicensed badges on cars, like the Silvia logo on the S15. You can't use an Xbox One remote, your car will glitch out. If you don't tune a car, but upgrade it, rather than it performing poorly, it decides it's gonna do 12 summersaults into the sky. The game is broken, unsupported, and please- do not buy this.

Pros: Good car physics, Realistic CAR textures; Great amount of cars; Good tracks to start with; Good car setup; Multiplayer and Lan features; The steering is great if you are a beginner because it helps you with counter steer; A̶l̶m̶o̶s̶t̶ full wheel and pedals compatibility;Cons: S̶o̶u̶n̶d̶ ̶e̶r̶r̶o̶r̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶p̶l̶a̶y̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶m̶u̶l̶t̶i̶p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶ (Fixed); L̶a̶g̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶m̶u̶l̶t̶i̶p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶r̶(Almost fixed); L̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶d̶e̶t̶a̶i̶l̶s̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶n̶v̶i̶r̶o̶n̶m̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶r̶a̶c̶k̶s̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶a̶l̶s̶o̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶b̶u̶g̶s̶ (Fixed); As I said the steering is great for beginners , but it's annoying if you want to ""step up"", for instance, if you want to make ""donuts"" the wheels are constantly turning to the opposite side making impossible keep the control of the car.Expected to see in future: At my point of view, it MUST be a option to deactivate the auto counter steer. It will be very useful; Car liveries; More customization features (Change rims, spoilers, body kits, more advanced suspension tuning, etc...); O̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶l̶o̶b̶y̶ ̶s̶e̶l̶e̶c̶t̶o̶r̶(Done :) );Final thoughts:Overall it's a good game.It's true that this game is still in development but come on!!!It's only 6$!!Some peple are complaining that this game is expensive and it's missing a lot o things, but keep in mind that you will not find the same thing on a 6$ game that you will find in a 50$ game!In my opinion the game is getting better and better with the regular updates and, in my point of view, is the best drifting game that I have played, or at least that I remember.Developers please continue your great job!

												After owning and playing the game for a while now, as well as keeping up with each and every update, i will not recommend this game to anybody. The community has asked for changes such as frame drops, physics fixes, and most importantly, controller support. The devs response to this is to and more and more content to hide the many faults this game has. I am usually satisfied with many unity games relating to motorsports but as a vehicle enthusiast such as myself, this is a major let down and i am very dissapointed.			",63,3,6,5,2,0,2

												TL:DR - This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks and you all know it.I didn't really enjoy the game to an extent. I've heard that people praised for its previous versions because of the old physics. But even with that,I still won't recommend it. It looks outdated,the effects were eye-gouching. The camera placement is hindering gameplay rather than helping you see what's in front of you. Especially in narrower maps like Akina,where every corners look as miniscule as a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Modding wasn't very intuitive and sometimes the forum don't look as active as it could've been.Would I say it's the worst I've played? No. - It's just flawed in so many ways,I've played it for a couple of hours in this game with friends just to bash about how terrible it is. It could be improved,I've already seen some people trying to mod this game,and that's great for them. If you look at this game in a value standpoint,it's a no-no at that. Then again,if the developer actually tries to make the game better,sure. I'll play it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will sum this up as quickly as I can. Controller support is crap. Brakes don't work, just throw your car into the air. It seems that if you have a newer graphics card (I have a 980ti) you can't adjust the graphics quality off of ""standard"". Video card runs hotter than with any other game I have played due to there being no vsync option. I don't require 200+ fps and would rather not have my card running 75c. Broken textures on some body kits. In its current form I can not recommend buying this game.			",34,8,3,12,8,0,2

												I'm going to be honest here. This game is not good. They physics are abismal, the sound cuts in and out online, controller support is nonexistant, and the point system is glitchy (you lose point on impact with anything, and i mean anything). The maps are poor quality, like relatable to need for speed underground, the first one from 2003! The only real redeaming factor for me is the fact I can mod it REALLY easily and make straight up joke cars. For god sake, I made a s2000 swapped with a 2jz that had so much power the number was an exponent! XD I really wouldnt recomend this game to anyone being I don't think its worth what you pay for. If it was free or under $4 then maybe. But NOT worth $7. TLDR: really not good, except as a joke when you mod it.			",48,2,4,2,3,2,0

												Drift Streets Japan is not the best car game i have played in a long shot. Yes its the only game like this on steam, and yes the drift physics are decent. But the game isn't perfect. Sure you many say for $6 its pretty cheap, and it is. But is it worth buying?To answer that in short : Yes, i think it is. I bought the game when it first came out, and back then lets be honest the game was missing ALOT, but after a week or so after release, the game has been updated quite a few times, always adding new and improved things. Such as manual transmission, more cars, a better interior, and much more. Yes, of course it could use alot of work, with the many bugs, and being able to use a controller, but if you look past that, and see that is has a chance to become something great, it makes you wonder why you shouldn't buy it. I do have high hopes for this game, as it has already come so far, and i do believe the dev's have some idea as to what they want to add.In short, i think Drift Streets Japan is great game to pick up. Yes, it has bugs and glitches, but what game doesn't? and what game on steam allows to buy drift like this game does? NOTHING.Hense why i recommend this game.			",90,13,11,7,13,0,2

												Poor port of a mobile game. Doesn't look great, bad 'career' set up, lack of content. You start the game and are given a certain amount of money to purchase a car. You can only afford one (why it doesn't just give you the first car is beyond me). To make money, you just select one of 5 maps and drift. That's it. The drifting is slippery and wonky, and the only way to really make money is exploit sliding in the grass for 10 minutes.			",138,23,16,28,22,0,22

												Everyone who played this game as long as I have knows that this game has improved. At first it will be diffucult with the lack of controller support. But, I and most people use the keyboard control and we have so much fun. You can either have a good time doing tandems, making friends or even just taking awesome pics. People that say that this game is bad are the people that don't practice to get better. It took me around 30 hours to master the technique, ever since I play this game at least once per week, it's not much but I don't have a lot of time anymore. The people that are complaining that there is no improvement need to go to the forums as there are 1000's of modded cars. If you want a rocket bunny S14 then go the the forums, you will find it on there. Now play this game and practice. Don't complain on something you try once or twice. ""practice makes perfect"" So stop complaining and start playing this amazing game. The dev left it but we haven't.			",22,1,3,0,0,0,0

												Really good game. The drift physics are fun and the multiplayer keeps me entertained. You can tune your cars and even though you may start with a terrible car, you can mod it to be like superman if he was a car. but with these pros there still comes cons. Here is a list for those who can't read poorly formated text:Pros: - Good drift physics (really fun and challenging if you have a faster car, but still fun)- Tunable cars (Really entertaining, and keeps you playing, also the possibilitys are endless)- Many variations in cars- Multiplayer (both lan and online multiplayer)- More features are still to come as this is not a finished gameCons:- Most Quality Graphics?? This is not a game for testing your new Nvidia Titan X. Quake has better graphics.although the only reason why I would say the graphics aren't good is because of the models, they are low poly however the car models are fine, just the map and such. The textures maybe a little too. The graphics are playable and decent though- FPS cap. So we don't have much of a graphics intensive game, which may be good for you guys with not so good specs, but now we have bumped into an fps cap :/ However, this will probably be removed in the future.- People who crowd around multiplayer and crash into you. (Collision atleast in spawn needs to be off)Overall, the game is great, and is like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas drifting but in one game, and improved in all the ways possible but graphics. Hopefully someone can make an enb mod for this :P			",85,8,19,0,9,0,8

												I'd recommend this, ONLY if the following apply to you.-You got a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket-You have access to a decent steering wheel (Logitech or better)-And are willing to put some work into sorting your controls (both via wheel & in-game)Things like visuals & audio are always subjective, some might like it, some won't. Music volume can be controlled if you don't like it, engine/exhaust/tire sounds do their part well, and the visuals are a step-above the old NFS-Underground games.If you're looking to play with a controller, wait until full-support is confirmed, or don't bother as it won't work.(long story short, it's both game & controller related, involving trigger command-axis issues)That^ said, I have been enjoying the game with my Logitech G27, set-up to behave like a drifting go-kart of sorts. The game offers some level of 'customization', which devolves to body-color/wheel color combos, and what engine/perfomance-stage parts you choose. There are a fair amount of JDM cars to choose from, and PLENTY of engine-swap choices (my current/favorite combo is a ""S240"" [a.k.a 240sx] with a ~500hp KA24DE[-T] motor).The physics are arcade-ish, but feel more 'weighed-down' than the NFS2015 ""200mph EVERYWHERE"" behavior, think the old Underground games with a hint-more realism and weight.Is there $7-worth of content ? - debatable Is there $7-worth of entertainment in the game ? - I'd say yes;Between the solo-mode and the lag-chaos of online, the occasional online tandem (that doesn't end in cars getting launched to space - although still humorous) and the solo practice of finding the sweet-spot for your driving style and the cars perfomance, I could see anyone (who's done the research/effort and didn't just go ""GAME BROKE PLZ FIX) enjoying themselves for around 7-hours total.

ALOT+really fun at times to just slide around+the customization is really nice with added engine swaps (sadly there is only ~200 bhp engines)-the sounds are horrible(almost went wan gogh style after playing this with headphones)+frequent updates-small map selection(hopefuly to-be better)+-not the best car selection, but improving every few days-horrible multiplayer(it is there)-the title of the game-no miatai would give this game 3/5 shredded tyres in its current state. i really see potential in this game, and hope that the developers will change the name of the game to something better,  improve graphics and really update this game in every aspect. in summary, really fun arcade drift game.its tottaly not a ""simulation"" game as the tags of this game says, dont be fooled			",110,11,14,10,13,0,9

												This ""game"" is easily one of the worst things I've ever played. Apart from being extremely buggy, having little to no customization options for controler or mouse and keyboard, and having an awful netcode, the driving, drifting, turning, breaking, everything mechanics are completely and utterly unrealistic. Frankly, calling this game a simulator is an insult. The only thing that could possibly save this game is the community created content. I got this game for 2.50USD, but I'll say I'm still extremely happy that I was able to get a refund on it. I can't in good conscience recommend this game even if it was free to play. Maybe if the devs of this got up and actually put some effort into this it could become something good.			",46,9,0,1,0,0,1

												Right now, the game is pretty broken, but with some added features like body kits and more fine tuning(Tire pressure, gear ratios etc. Like Forza), This game is going to be awesome. The graphics could also be better, the car exterior graphics are good, but the interior of the car and the track's graphics aren't good at all.EDIT: Since there now are body kits, that's good. Still no in-depth tuning of the car though.			",140,9,5,8,7,1,9

												Let me just keep it simple. Pro's + Fun mechanics, takes a while to get used to it, but all in all it's quite enjoyable to just slide.+ Multiplayer has a lot of people on it, tons of people to drag against or drift with and syncro. + $6.99 is modest as ♥♥♥♥ for a game like this, me and all my mates have bought it.+ the turbo spool sounds absolutely amazing, really impressed by it.+ Decent music selection. + Akina is very well made. + GREAT car selection, could use a few more but at this point it's great.+ Very DETAILED cars (besides the fake names which I believe is done for the purpose of avoiding copyright)Con's While I understand the game isn't yet complete, and not anywhere near that stage, these are based on what I see the game needing currently.- Needs more multiplayer options/servers, a drag mode could be cool, and a faceoff mode would be sick.- Needs more paint options for the car, JUST painting the body and rims isn't really enough.- We need somewhere to suggest music for the game, it'd be really sick to hear some music we genuinely listen to whilst drifting.- more maps, maybe a drag strip map for a drag mode or something like that.- Need more part selection for the cars in the game.- A few more vehicles would be cool too, maybe add some muscle to drift with, I'd suggest a BMW M3 (E36), RX8, Ford Mustang, would be mildly hilarious to see a Nissan Fairlady Z, they're ugly but it'd be worth the laugh.- NEED TO FIX the multiplayer sound bug, it's really annoying, I have to play with volume off now because of it. - REMOVE car contact on multiplayer, ANNOYING as ♥♥♥♥ getting hit out of a big drift and losing valuable mula.- Down shifting is really off. - tracks aren't designed for cars really anywhere above 350hp max, bit of a shame. - Breaks need to be fixed, or made customizable, aka let me throw brembo's on my 777hp AE86 so I can stop it lol.At this stage I can say I am extremely happy with the game and every cent i spent on it, it's quite fun, especially linking massive drifts together for money on a private lan, beyond the cons I can happily say I am content with the purchase and I recommend it to anyone into the drift/jdm/customization scene.By the way for anyone complaining about FPS drops, that's all you, I run a beefy set up and I never drop FPS dramatically at all, if you didn't know, this game has a SINGLE dev, you're going to need to be patient and wait for him to find the time to make this game what we all want, I'm sure he'll get to it all with time.

												Summary:♥♥♥♥♥♥game and ♥♥♥♥ing useless developer. Don't buy, spend money elsewhere.I love cars and thought this game would be cool. It was alright when I got it, you just had to get used to the crappy physics and controls. NOw after the ""update"" it is complete trash. Don't buy this game. The developer thinks he's updating the game, but he's making it more trash. My car will randomly roll over if I drift and I go flying off the map into oblivion. Also the camera is super crap. I can't drift, and if I go online my framrate drops by a million. Please spend your $5 on a good game, with a nice developer, who likes games more than money. ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥game and dev.

												waited a few months before i left this review.  great concept, but executed horribly thus far. for months now people have been waiting for controller support, still nothing. yes you can connect a wheel and pedals but theres no force feeback so whats the point, even if the game just added some resistance i would be happy. i could accept that from a game that is still this early, but even xbox controller is completly useless, which again wouldnt bother me that much if the dev had not stated many times over that it is ""fixed""overall i think this game could be pretty neat but i have a feeling that one day soon the dev is just going to stop working on the project and move on. quit adding content!!!!!!! the base game is good enough already, the cars supplied in the game currently are more than enough for a game this early. just fix the base game before you keep adding more unwanted garbage and i will happily change my review to a positive one.

Attention, looks like the devs abandoned the game. Also they are working in a new game on greenlight, so if you bought this game make sure to tell the devs to not left this good proyect behind.Why i do not recommend the game?* Game is empty, there is no objective, or history on the game, not even a race, just a free roam on different maps to get points, and money to waste in cars, or autoparts.* Fov from cars are very bad adjusted, with some cars you just can't see the track well.* 170hp cars are better than 650hp cars, high end racing cars are just unmanageable even changing tunning options.* Multiplayer is just a joke, same as singleplayer, a free roam on different tracks, with no objective, but with people driving on it, also they can troll your drifting points by hiting you (the only fun part of the game).* Bodykits are not for all cars, just some cars can be modified visually.* No stickers, no graphic stuff for the cars, also no pilot / arms on car.* No workshop, they support mods, but button gets you to the forum and you need to install them (not many mods) manually on game folder.* sometimes the game crash, it makes my pc restart two times, also i found some bugs.* Last but not least, there are not many tracks where you can drift, but game has a level editor (never tried it).I really want to like this game, but it needs to be polished, and also finished, it looks like a pre-alpha in it's actual state.

												The game is glitchy. Other than that its fun for about 20 minutes then you get bored.The 4 or so hours you see is me mostly trying to get the controls to work. Even after all this time the Dev has not fixed the controls. The controls will kinda work when installed, but if you change something and it messes up you will likely not be able to fix it with out regesrty editing. I have waited long enough for a fix.

												This game is unfinished, and should be advertised as such.  Controller intagration is nearly non existint, because whenever you try to use a controller, the game gets stuck on full throttle and the joysticks don't work.  So unless you have the wheel, you will have to us a keyboard... which is near impossible when it comes to drifting.  Not only that, but the models for the cars arent finished either.  with you being able to see the lack of a front mount, or anything, for that matter behind the front bumper on the 240sx.  As well as on the JZX100 (the only other car I bought) where you can see through parts of the interior that weren't textured/only had textures on one side all the way to the ground below.  This game has potential, but isn't nearly far enough along to be advertised as being even close to a finished product.			",13,0,2,2,2,1,0

												Alright, i'll be completely honest here.i had a lot of faith in this game when i bought it; the constant updates every day or so, the community etc. until about a month or two after, when updates basically halted to once every three weeks, and with every update that brought content or fixes, another bug would arise. this game is great in it's concept however leaving a game that has it's whole back-story/influence to a russian guy is like letting an indian direct a movie about the american civil war, it makes no sense whatsoever. this game had so much potential for growth however it looks to be just a cash-grab for the dev as he seems to be focused on making another game, and it looks to be that he is pretty much porting stuff from that game and putting it in DSJ.honestly, buy it if you've got the dosh to spare, but don't expect much.

												How does steam even have the nads to include this piece of tat in their current lunar new year sale?The game starts up with the usual Unity engine launcher and logo, then it's straight to the garage. No main menu, no title screen, nothing. After spazzing out to all the crazy crhomatic abberation and other photo effects, i buy a car and try to drive it, only to find out my controller isn't set up by default ( it's a xbox one controller). Keyboard it is for now, i guess.The track design looks like something a modder would make for re-volt as a first track or something.Refund pending.			",330,49,17,48,53,2,56

												The game has way too many bugs. No gamepad configuration option. The physics aren't horrible but not amazing.  The graphics aren't bad either, but, the glitches just kill it, especially in multiplayer. Even though there's really no one in them.  The customizing is easy and pretty cool. It took 15 mins alone to get the game to fit the screen... which was windowed... no thanks. It needs a ton of workUPDATE: Oh that's awesome. I paid 11.99 for this crap and obviously the turds who didn't like the thumbs down were probably the ones who liked it. PLOT TWIST: The game is so bad, they lowered the price down to 4.99.  Oh the irony!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awful physics, awful controller support, glitchy multiplayer and not even support for adjusting controller mapping in-game, something that should be taken for granted these days, especially on racing games.If the glitches are fixed, proper controller support added, and fix bugs for multi (and single player) I'd probably buy it again.The concept is great, you have control over camber and offset of the wheels, you can tune the car (not as fine-tuned as possible, but certainly a nice amount) and the multiplayer is in theory where the fun really is. But all the issues take A LOT away from the experience.At this moment, would not recommend this game. 4/10Fix the bugs and it would easily be 8/10 or even 9/10.			",239,15,18,27,11,2,17

Could be massively improved with working controller support. Also using foot brake in a drift will more than likely spin out the car. The tracks need to be smoothed out a bit.With some physics tweaking, some competitive game modes, better tracks, and more upgradability and tuning i could definitely put some hours in.

												this game is unfinnished and is not in a playable state. ive offered help to the dev to add acceptable controller support and he is not willing to get the ""Rewired"" asset in the unity store to properly add controller support into the game, hes to stuck on making the controller support him self. other than that the textures and lighting looks nice the ui doesnt scale correctly for 1080p or above the physics (again no controller support) are very sloppy while playing on keyboard and feel like your sliding around on ice. all the music for the most part im pretty sure is copy righted and he's probably not using it legally.this unity asset i speak of is called ""Rewired"" by Guavaman Enterprises and does 90% of the work for him and it costs $45 USD and its a one time cost. no royalties to be payed, he can use it in as many games as he wants.and its not like as if he cant afford it because according to steamspy he's sold about 7,800 copies. lets do some simple math here. 7800 copies x $7USD Per copy = $54600 USD. even after Valves fee's, $45 USD for a unity assett that significantly improve gameplay and will pretty much do everything for you in the way of adding controller support, is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. his reasoning for not getting the ""Rewired"" assett pack is ""because its sh*t"" - JDM4iK thats funny because everyone who has taken the time to give the ""Rewired"" assett  a review on the unity assett store page has given it a 5/5 star rating and positive review. ""Because its Sh*t"" he says.Do not Buy this game.			",195,15,17,15,16,4,13

Posted: February 18, 2016
												A quick summary: this is a very rudimentary release about a year of two of development away from being an actual game, and the store page hugely exaggerates the features on offer.Driving: Initially in the only available starter car, the physics seem decent with a fairly natural if exaggerated feel to the drifting. However, as soon as you add power or change to another car it starts to fall apart, with bizarre spins, slides and acceleration in unexpected directions. It feels more like a set of predefined reactions to certain inputs rather than any actual physics simulation, and once you deviate from basic powerslides it breaks.Graphics: The car models are serviceable if rather low-poly (ignoring the large holes in some), but the tracks are very, very basic - some games of the 1990s had more trackside detail. The 'traffic' only exists on one track, and seems to be mainly static cars with extremely low levels of detail.Gameplay: The only gameplay loop that exists is that scoring drift points gives the player a small amount of money per point, which they can use to upgrade then score more points. There is no other gameplay at all.UI: The menus are relatively clean and functional, however simply viewing any performance upgrade seems to immediately purchase it with no confirmation.Audio: The sound effects are passable, the highlight being the turbo sounds. The music is not to my own tastes, but the production is at least okay.Car culture: The choice of cars is well selected for a drifting game. While bodykits are only currently implemented for one car, and there are only 5 choices of wheels, the sheer presence of visual upgrades at least scores a point here. The engine swapping feature is also decent, although the stats for the engines generally bear very little resemblance to the real engines that they are named after.Overall: The game frankly lacks even the most basic levels of polish or even gameplay, and has some jarring inconsistencies in the quality of the art assets. While the developers clearly have put some heart into it and are continuing to work on the game, I wouldn't recommend a purchase now unless it's 90% off and you're happy with 20 minutes or so of just toying around. Hopefully the support keeps coming, and in a year or two this may be worth the budget price.			",539,139,42,41,55,7,50

												First of all, the graphics are arcadey which is fine, and would be fun, but the car has almost no control at all. Also, if you so much as scrape a wall you loose all points. I don't think the creators of this game realize, that if you scrape a wall and keep going in a drift series, that usually works in your favor, adding style points usually.			",34,0,6,3,4,0,1

												this game is unfinnished and is not in a playable state. ive offered help to the dev to add acceptable controller support and he is not willing to get the ""Rewired"" asset in the unity store to properly add controller support into the game, hes to stuck on making the controller support him self. other than that the textures and lighting looks nice the ui doesnt scale correctly for 1080p or above the physics (again no controller support) are very sloppy while playing on keyboard and feel like your sliding around on ice. all the music for the most part im pretty sure is copy righted and he's probably not using it legally.this unity asset i speak of is called ""Rewired"" by Guavaman Enterprises and does 90% of the work for him and it costs $45 USD and its a one time cost. no royalties to be payed, he can use it in as many games as he wants.and its not like as if he cant afford it because according to steamspy he's sold about 7,800 copies. lets do some simple math here. 7800 copies x $7USD Per copy = $54600 USD. even after Valves fee's, $45 USD for a unity assett that significantly improve gameplay and will pretty much do everything for you in the way of adding controller support, is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. his reasoning for not getting the ""Rewired"" assett pack is ""because its sh*t"" - JDM4iK thats funny because everyone who has taken the time to give the ""Rewired"" assett  a review on the unity assett store page has given it a 5/5 star rating and positive review. ""Because its Sh*t"" he says.Do not Buy this game.			",195,15,17,15,16,4,13

												DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! AVOID!!!  Great graphics on the car models thats it. The game play and controls are horrible the cars auto counter steer sometimes and do nothing other times and its garbage. Controller support is a joke I tired a XBOX360, PS4, Saitek and Logictech controllers none work properly, button mapping is a total mess and its unplayable with the keyboard. Dont waste your time or money, this game isnt finished and it shows. The sound effects are Atari 2600 quality and its tracks and backgrounds look PS2 at best. This game should be removed from steam until its finished paying 8 bucks for a Beta at best.  1 ot of 5 stars			",31,8,1,2,4,0,1

												This game is very simple and awesome! I'd give it an 8.7/10There aren't many maps, but honestly you don't need more than those that are already in the game! They teach you how to drift  slow and steady and by tuning the car and messing around you can get your drift skills to the max, and make combos that go around 1.000.000. Points :D Soon you'll be drifting like a boss.The bad thing on this game though is, you cannot put on spoilers or change the bodykit a bit. You can however change the color of the rims/body and angle your tires or widen them. I don't mind it not being filled with tuning possiblilities like in Need for Speed, but it could make the game more fun. So customisation would be awesome for an update. Maybe a few more cars (not just JDM) ;)I'm glad finally some racing game put in a Nissan 350z in it ^_^			",118,51,6,21,16,3,6

												Okay, redoing this review to help some people out if possible.This game is far from finished, is that a bad thing? Absolutely not, this isn't just an android game that's been ported to steam to get the dev some extra cash. The dev(s) are actually updating the game and listening to what people want implemented into the game. There's no stupid microtransactions it just comes down to earning the money yourself to buy cars and upgrade them.

												This game has lots of potential, and I feel like the game is well worth the $10 that you will pay for it. TL;DR at the bottom.Pros:Sounds - the engines in this game sound pretty close to the real life counter parts, and that is important in a game like this! Big Pro!Car Looks - Cars look amazing.Customization - There are some cool options and the devs add more and more.Constant Updates - It is great that the game gets constant updates. The devs are active and so is the community!Cockpit View - It is a great thing to have and if you have a wheel, then you are set!Cons: Glitches - This game is a glitch fest (At the time I am writing this which would be April 4th 2016), I won't lie. Braking downhill is sh$t, hitting the wall or someone else at a high speed glitches your car, and so on. Track Graphics - They are not that good, not a big con but it takes away from the immersion.Car Interior - Not detailed enough, especially when the game has a cockpit view, you would want to have some sort of detail. Though keep in mind this game costs $10, so having a cockpit view is still great!Controller Support - (at the time of writing this) Pure balls. Seriously it is not that good.Car Handling - There are some cars that handle like complete crap, that definitely needs to be fixed.TL;DR Overall, while glitchy, if you are a car enthusiast and you like drifting, turbo flutter, and JDM. Hell ♥♥♥♥ing Yeah get this game!			",61,4,3,6,4,1,1

												First off let me say, the game COULD be a lot of fun. The cars are great, the upgrade system is nice, the maps are meh okayyy, but trying to play this game with a keyboard only (especially with all the drifting that requires to constantly change steering directions, releasing and pressing the gas to coordinate clean drifts) makes it a NIGHTMARE to control your car. Like I said this game COULD be a lot of fun, but being restricted to a keyboard in a game where the only way to play it properly would be with a controller, in all honesty, makes it really hard to enjoy. If you implement FULL controller support (xbox 360 joystick, even the d-pad for christs sake) sometime soon, I would gladly change this review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. But for now, I'm kind of feeling like I just wasted 7 dollars on game that's virtually unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow.  This game seems super incomplete and hacky and broken.I hope they continue working on it.  I would like a fun ricing game where you can do stupid mods on your car and race some nice mountain tracks, etc.Unfortunately, so far this feels like early alpha. Using a gamepad won't really work.  Partial gamepad support implies that you can play with it, but with limited functionality.  I couldn't even figure out how to make it work.  The configuration is very janky.  I couldn't figure out how to remove a secondary control once it was set.The physics are silly, the cars automatically countersteer, the brakes don't really work,The controls on the keyboard have certain  things hardcoded.  Pressing R puts you at the start of the track, even if you have assigned R to another function.The tracks are very coarse.  The centre line is made up of big linear segments.  The terrain is really repetitive.  It feels like it's all just placeholders.It looks like this game is being actively developed, so maybe it will turn into something some day, but for now it's really not worth buying, and I really don't see how it got such decent reviews.  It should still be early access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this is game is fun to play but the deacceleration on the brakes are so slow you barely can't brake for the corners ! This is super anoying because if you'd brake like you do normaly then you end up in the tire wall			",65,1,7,8,11,0,9

												This game is alright. Decent amount of cars and a nice amount customization. You can change a lot of settings like camber or if the car is Front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, or all wheel drive. But the thing that gets me so ♥♥♥♥ing mad about this game is that the creators expect you to pay for a game and they expect you to figure out how it works. DO NOT USE A CONTROLLER IN THIS GAME. Steering wheel support for this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I used my Thrustmaster T80 and it was♥♥♥♥♥♥ I couldn't steer on drive with my wheel. So when I put unplugged my wheel and tried to use the keyboard... I was ♥♥♥♥ed. You can't reset your keys and you cant input new keys once you set a controller key for them. If a game cant put in a simple reset button, it just shows that the creators don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about your gaming experience. This game is not worth your 9 dollars. But if you do feel like buying it, wait for a sale or wait until there are more updates. This game was a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥-1000000000000000000000/10			",46,2,10,3,6,0,0

												This game is so horrible that even takes part of IGM worst game of the year.I would say its very close to be at least a lil good one but still worst because every racing game made on Unity is really a pile of junk and no one likes random jumps from MX-5 on mountains drifting, making more than 10k score and randomly jump.I will go with good stuff and bad stuff:Good stuff: -MOUNTAIN AKINA WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO THE REAL ONE AND EVEN FROM THE ''D''-Lots of cars even Fairlady Z and AE86-Tokyo Highway but it's so lonely that you are going to see a minivan and a ae86 with blue rims-Multiplayer is ok but rare-Many mods you can do on your car like in real lifeBad stuff:- A really bad optimize for older system, SSAO and 8x Antialiasing is only on and off option- You cannot modify game settings to a lower res- The sh**est physics i've ever tried and ProStreet has better than it- You have to drift everyday on Akina to get some cash for your next upgrade- Made by Russians because there is too much Trap music on there- Saucy mods which arent mods- Ugly textures on trees and other misc. stuff- If you want to play on lower resolution on fullscreen, you are stuck to nothing- It's very clean and very boring like MMO games in particularOK STUFF:-AKINA BECAUSE WHY NOT+ if you get some eurobeat, you are going to feel the powerslide- Level editor is very icy because there is nothing but only props install- You can do LAN race/ Host for a serverIf only this game would cost 1.99$ on sale or something but it's very bad and very bad that i recommend playing initial d on ps2 emulator			",94,9,19,16,16,2,6

												A good game, but...The JDM style is respected with a lot of JDM drift cars, and some very good tracks (like the touge).The drift is sometimes very realistic, but there is many problems.This game is not finished. There is too much stupid fails (sometimes your car start to flight !)And the realism is VERY good in some conditions (drift at medium speed), but in slow curves it's too hard to spin, and in high speed curves it's too hard (to drift like in real life).You can tune some cars with 4 differents bodykits, and some others cars you can't !This game is good for Drift fans, but for exemple ""CarX Drift Racing"" is better in every thing (and it's just an Android App !).

												A good game, but...The JDM style is respected with a lot of JDM drift cars, and some very good tracks (like the touge).The drift is sometimes very realistic, but there is many problems.This game is not finished. There is too much stupid fails (sometimes your car start to flight !)And the realism is VERY good in some conditions (drift at medium speed), but in slow curves it's too hard to spin, and in high speed curves it's too hard (to drift like in real life).You can tune some cars with 4 differents bodykits, and some others cars you can't !This game is good for Drift fans, but for exemple ""CarX Drift Racing"" is better in every thing (and it's just an Android App !).

												If you played Gran Turismo growing up your mostly gonna like this. It´s more of a arcade game then a simmulation game.Does that mean its boring? hell no You can swap any car with almost any engine. Theres car and map mods. Some servers allow you to have mods. Most JDM cars are in the game. I would probably give this an 4/5 since there is room for improvment.			",54,6,5,8,3,0,0

												For a game that blatantly rips off other games models and textures, has no direction for gameplay other than freeroam drifting or online freeroam drifting and buying cars this game has so much potential and is one of those rare gem games that i will be watching closely.From what a few friends have told me there is alot of regular updates for this game keeping it fresh, there is a very basic level editor built into the game so you can even make your own courses though it would be nice if they allowed more objects and textures to be used in the Editor it is still very user friendly.The only downfall i have noticed with this game so far is that online requires a decent connection or you will D/C after about 30 seconds with no warning, and you can only control master volume levels.The first time you play the game it will seem very badly made hard to control and incredibly frustrating but if you keep at it and find a nice level to practice on (i use drift track 1's big open space at the spawn to practice without fear of bumping into things) until you are comfortable with your car.There is a huge variety of cars of which none are liscenced so the skins are mirrored or emblems are chromed other than that some of the most popular drift cars appear in this game.Hopefully there is more tracks comming soon and i definatly reccomend grabbing this title if you havnt already. 7/10			",49,11,2,2,7,1,3

												Game needs a lot of work, the sound of the engines are far too loud and there's no option to change it. Saying the physics are wonky would be like saying that the Atlantic ocean is damp, the cars flip and fly about the track, fall out of bounds and there's no reset other than dropping out of the map and restarting it. It's more like bumper cars than actual racing and drifting, it's not even worth the $5 with it's cumbersome menus and lack of controller support.			",158,26,2,21,14,0,4

												So I decided to give this game another chance, it isn't any better then when you guys initailly ♥♥♥♥ed it up. Just going to go play Forza Horizon 3, a game that actually works and has good and decent mechanics. Yeah you guys brought some stuff back and removed that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea of an update. Still this is what needs to be fix imo1. fix the breaking mechanics, when I tap my breaks before entering a corner it should not shoot my car off in the opposite direction spinning like a bat out of hell.2. Fix the shifting mechanic plz! Honestly I hate how I have to shift in this game. 3. The handbreak needs to work as it should. I get the feeling none of you working on this game can actually drift or have no real idea as to how drifting works. The handbreak shouldn't cause me to loose speed like it does in this game. 4. It should fully support the use of any controller the player uses. I use an Xbox ONE controller, some may use PS3 controllers and some might have the Steam Controller, and verious other controllers out there. Honestly I love the idea of what this game could be, but you guys seem to lack the skill to bring it to the level it should be at. IF the devs really grind away on fixing EVERYTHING wrong with this game it could become a great rival to Forza Horizon seeing as there is really no Competition to that game. I STILL DON'T RECOMEND THIS GAME. Guys if you have an Xbox ONE I suggest you get Forza Horizon 3 instead of this, if you own a PS3 or PS4 get Grand Tourismo 5 or 6. Cause this game can't even begin to live up to the level those two games have risen to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I decided to give this game another chance, it isn't any better then when you guys initailly ♥♥♥♥ed it up. Just going to go play Forza Horizon 3, a game that actually works and has good and decent mechanics. Yeah you guys brought some stuff back and removed that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea of an update. Still this is what needs to be fix imo1. fix the breaking mechanics, when I tap my breaks before entering a corner it should not shoot my car off in the opposite direction spinning like a bat out of hell.2. Fix the shifting mechanic plz! Honestly I hate how I have to shift in this game. 3. The handbreak needs to work as it should. I get the feeling none of you working on this game can actually drift or have no real idea as to how drifting works. The handbreak shouldn't cause me to loose speed like it does in this game. 4. It should fully support the use of any controller the player uses. I use an Xbox ONE controller, some may use PS3 controllers and some might have the Steam Controller, and verious other controllers out there. Honestly I love the idea of what this game could be, but you guys seem to lack the skill to bring it to the level it should be at. IF the devs really grind away on fixing EVERYTHING wrong with this game it could become a great rival to Forza Horizon seeing as there is really no Competition to that game. I STILL DON'T RECOMEND THIS GAME. Guys if you have an Xbox ONE I suggest you get Forza Horizon 3 instead of this, if you own a PS3 or PS4 get Grand Tourismo 5 or 6. Cause this game can't even begin to live up to the level those two games have risen to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Allright. At first. I hated this game. Didn't know how to drift in this game because the controls were ""unique"" or how should I call it. Wheel like Thrustmaster T150 doesn't work so who has it and wanted to play this game, then Rest in piece man. I want that to happen too.A lot of greatly customizable cars, when you know how to drift, then this game is awesome.One thing I would LOVE to see in this game.Muffler/Exhaust customization. Really would love to see that in this game because with the first car (Nissan 240SX) When you put a different rear bumper the exhaust is hidden, you just have a hole in the bumper. So please add exhaust customization.			",64,3,21,2,14,0,2

												EDITED MY UPDATE, everything in square brackets is an elaboration of recent updates to things i complained about.things that really poop on this game for me...- [You have to get used to cars not being able to counter steer properly] when you get going fast enough and try to counter steer, the camera will 180 and spin you out of control, instead of sustaining a counter steer.- [Works for some people] the controller support sucks and you can't use triggers or joysticks (axises), only buttons.- lagged out vehicle collision (russians teleporting into you)- no racing- [PATCHED] only 1 map for multiplayer, the rest are LAN- Hackers everywhereoverall its an ok game, could use a lot of work though			",200,17,4,9,13,1,13

												This game is a lot of fun!  ...if you love to drive vehicles that can hardly be driven.  Whenever I try to drive my car into a sharp turn, it rolls over.  Whenever I try to drift, it rolls over.  Heck!  One time, when I drove it into a road metal barrier while trying to get a grip on the controls, a glitch sent it flying!  This buggy, underdeveloped mess belong on a f2p gamesite like Kongregate!  Not on the Steam store!			",342,154,25,36,58,1,29

												Man I thought this game would be awesome and everything like LOOK AT THE CARS, LOOK AT THOSE DRIFTS, LOOK AT THOSE MAPS... but for real what the actual ♥♥♥♥ is this, fullscreen is broken, controller doesn't work, the game is a left and right simulator... even arcade games have more than this! IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A DRIFTING GAME HAHAHAHAHAHA! I honestly can not be professional towards this game at all it doesn't deserve it.The two only good things about this game are one the cars and customization and two playing online with people... this has to be the shortest damn good point I've ever written for a game, good or bad.Now the bad like I said before fullscreen is broken, there is no options for graphics, the damn controller doesn't work, there is no challange in this whatsoever... why the ♥♥♥♥ is this here, why does this ♥♥♥♥ing exist on steam.Personally stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game unless you actually enjoy♥♥♥♥♥♥poor mobile games on your damn pc not that its always bad BUT THIS IS BAD, I'm lucky this game came in a $4 USD bundle... if it was up to me this game wouldn't even be worth it for free! I'm sorry but even those updates won't save this game no matter how nicely you treat this and update it. I ACTUALLY HAD TO LOG IN 5 MINUTES INTO THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME JUST TO POST THE DAMN REVIEW...

												Don`t buy low-end junk!I have only seven minutes on record. In this seven minutes i had to restart this game about 6 times to mess with these terrible setting thid game has to offer.So this Game has some serious issues. The menu is terrible: FOr example there is no Exit Button to ""Exit"" the Game OR there is one but i cant see it because the resolutions of this game are messed up as hell.  The Controls are a joke, even when u change them this Game doesn`t give a♥♥♥♥♥♥because once u are ingame the default settings are back in place.This game has decent graphics and the sound is okay but nothing special. The Physics are good that`s a plus for sure. The driving feels surprisingly well i have to admit.But Guys this game has no sweetspot from any point of view. Why would u buy this game for about 7€ when out there are so much better alternatives?  Right there`s no reason for that! U can get Games like Dirt3, Bournout Paradise etc. for the same OR a bit of extra money.As i said: Don`t waste your money on low-end junk!			",252,56,13,34,34,3,51

Am I supposed to be able to flip my car over with the lightest tough against another vehicle? I thought not.I guess I don't really understand the point of this game. In my experience, the drifting mechanics in racing games not even heavily focussed on drifting is better than what is on display here. Assetto Corsa? NFS Shift 2? Heck, even Dirt 3. Maybe it has a place because it's only $7? Seriously though, spend your $7 elsewhere.			",552,165,24,63,77,6,92

												this game does not support controllers this really sucks first of all i do not want to or should have to download a 3rd party app just to get a wheel or joystick to work. Also every single car in this game has major understteer problems and feint drifting in this game is physically impossible ( you do not or should not have to use the E-Brake to feint drift look it up dammit) the dev should have thought about looking at racing scripts before uploading this to steam because it has some of the worst mechanics i have ever experienced plus it feels more like an arcade game. The inside viewmodels are absolutely terrible and some of the years on the cars are completely off. I do love the choices in cars and engines though; sadly this seems to be the only experience this dev had with cars  though because this game is so bad im considering a refund you seriously need to fix this now!!! AND BEFORE YOU SAY ITS ONLY 7 BUCKS WELL I COUULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A REAL RACING GAME FOR THAT MUCH IT IS SERIOUSLY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ME OFF!!! FIX IT NOW YOUU HAVE THE MONEY NOW WITH THE REVENUE FROM STEAM THIS IS TERRIBLE. Dont upload something if your the only person that thinks its right it feels like the damn thing wasnt even tested most of the tracks have invisible walls that halt you in you tracks. Also the engine rpms will drop if you excede certain angles WTF!!! What do you think happens when a tire has no traction you think it has a mind of its own and decides to drop rpm.............. You cant stop when going in revers your car simpoly glides backwards for 100 feet and they still have not fixed the controller support as of 2/20/2016 they clame they did but no no no they did not at all and the fix they posted has the potential to seriously mess up the game also the ""fix"" guide is so bad they dont even show you everything in the regedit which btw they want you toi edit if you want to play with a controller this should have been patched in so the average user doesnt make there game unplayable the creator of this game has no regard for the consumer only his buddies and doesnt care if it is unpayable because steam is already paying him for it.

												Sure, there aren't many tracks or cars and maybe the physics is a bit wacky, but I believe this game has so much potential, if the developers are willing to add more things into it, like spicing up Multiplayer with races, adding more cars, maybe tweaking the physics, adding singleplayer races, and the list goes on. I'm enjoying the game as it is, despite being in early stages. It's not your average arcade drifter where you can simply flick the wheel and become the next imagining of Takumi Fujiwara. It actually takes a bit of tweaking your car (with modifications and wheel alignment) and practice to get used to it all, which is exactly what I've been looking for.For being a $6.99 game, it's not expected to be perfect, but I believe it is worth it, granted if you can get past the initial aggravation of dealing with the physics. This game certainly has potential to become great despite its flaws or what it lacks and I hope the developers have a lot in store for 2016. In the meantime, I'll be sliding around the mountain in my 240SX, perfecting my drifting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love Cars? Drifting? Illegal races?  This is your game!I love this game, I lovespeed and cars. I remember when after school I went to arcades to play the classic Daytona with my friends. This is not ""Daytona"" but a nice version of an illegal racing, in your illegal garage with the chance of putting some stuff in your car.This is a really good game with a lot of options a the garage to set up your engines, cambers, offsets, and, of course, all tunning stuff related! Of course, takes money from your budget. At the beginning, you have to start with a base car. The good news: painting it's free! Then with the money you will be able to change the engine, adding extra HP it's quite nice. Don't forget to check the turbo, adding nitro and many other interesting things. Of course, we can change the body, swap, and rims!Gameplay: I suggest a joystick, but also keyboard helps. You have the LAN option, playing alone or with friends at the Japan highways or multiplayer version, with other people and try to get some money. You have a chat option and summon friends to race or just having fun drifting. You have a lot of things to do.You have two cameras options, third person, and first person, I always like third but both are great.Graphics: Graphics are not bad. We are not talking about GTA V but I really like the work of the artist team. Cars are different, you can personalize colors. Textures are cool too.Music: The best part of it. The sound of the engine is different from first person camera, also the music. And the themes are just great. Enjoy good music for speed? You gonna have it here!Creating new scenarios: I think this is the big one of the game. You can create your own racetrack! I tried, but I have to say you need patience. The editor seems not to be complicated but you need to have some time.Extras: There's no presentation of the game after the ""made by unity"". You just go to the garage. I suggest to fix that, would be nice to have a good presentation of the game.You can subscribe the forum. You'll get an extra car if you validate your Steam account. Also, many gamers share their scenarios created with the editor and you can download them for free! It's a great community. I loved that.All extras of this games deserve a 3/5. Of course, all games could be better but this one, I loved it.Suit up boys and girls, it's time for speed!			",870,325,21,57,111,12,99

												this game just plain and simple doesnt work. Supposedly it has controler support, i guess it just doesnt support an xbox 360 controller. My 15 minutes of play time was spent trying to get the throttle to respond at all rather than just sticking wide open and sending the car flipping all over when i hit what seemed to be reverse. Checked the steam forums for help and found nothing, not even the ""official"" site has any kind of problem solving available. Couldnt map the controler at all, couldnt get rid of keyboard commands at all. Its a shame because the game looks really fun.			",142,20,19,10,23,0,11

												If you did not like Midnightclub LA because of its brickmods, glowing bright cars, and speed codes you will not like this either because it already has it. Yes this game can be edited with hex codes. Already a few people found out how to make brick mods so it will only grow in number.(A brick mod is a hex code designed to hit other people to make them go flying while being unmovable itself.)

												1. Why do I need buy to same tuning part again and again if I downgrade a part and then want to change it back to the better more expensive already purchased one??2. Only a few cars are left hand drive? Why? Yes the game is called DriftStreets JAPAN; where the cars are right hand drive but over here in Europe we buy, drive, race and yes even drift left hand drive  cars, even the Japaneese ones!3. Graphics seem to have some kind of bug when driving with view in cockpit mode. All background goes yellow/orange and can´t see track infront!4. Where are the bodykits for cars like Toyota GT86??5. Why is reverse gear on the brake pedal? And why can´t I have handbrake on shiftastick and use gear paddles to shift. Would be more realistic!If theese bugs would be solved this could be a great drifting simulator and hours of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would advice you not to buy it, you can assign right trigger and left trigger, for accelleration and braking but it wont work in the game. You will be forced to only use right stick for gas, same issue if using a ps4 controller with DS4, wont work.Aside from this the game works fine, so if you're okay with only using right stick for gas, buy it.

												Love Cars? Drifting? Illegal races? This is your game!This game is somewhat the best I've played throughout my years in Steam. I remember when after school I went to arcades to play some class games similar to this with my friends. This time, they've taken the whole experience of having to spend $2 per round at an arcade full of random people constantly watch your skills to your own PC! This is a really great game with a ways you can customize your rides and pimp them out to your dreamed wives in your garages to set up your engines, cambers, offsets, and so on. At the beginning, you have to start with a cocky ride, but as you play along you're bound to get rich and make it rain all over cars. One of the plus side is colour customizations is free, unlike many other games out there, painting would be the thing that eats up your in game money. You're bound to customize every detail just like me, From it's brakes to the very own rims!Though, I strongly suggest using a controller / Joystick but it's compactable with a keyboard helps. You have the LAN option, playing alone or with friends in the Japan highways or multilayer version, with other people as you try to earn some money. You have a chat option and summon friends to race or just having fun drifting. You have a lot of things to do as to compared to others, you can't.You have two camera, third person and first person, I personally prefer a third party view, but different peoples have different perspectives.Graphics aren't bad. We are not talking about GTA V but I personally really like the amount of effort of the artist team as put into the game.I think one of the main attraction of the game is where you can create your own racetrack! I tried, but I have to say you need patience. The editor seems not to be complicated as it seems, But I'm just an impatient player.You can subscribe the forum. You'll get an extra car if you validate your Steam account. Also, many gamers share their scenarios created with the editor and you can download them for free! It's a great community. I loved that.This game deserves a 8/10 rating from me.Suit up boys and girls, it's time for speed!			",211,51,10,14,29,6,22

												Dont know what to write here so here is how to install a turbo boost gauge.A little bit of consideration is essential before handing over your cash for a particular boost gauge.First, you need to decide the maximum boost pressure you plan to run. If, for example, you expect to run no more than 1.2 Bar (17.4 psi), a gauge that reads up to 1.5 Bar (21.8 psi) is perfect - it's good to have a little bit of headroom so you can recognise overboost conditions.You may be aware that some boost gauges read positive pressure and engine vacuum; a vacuum scale is very handy for setting up an adjustable blow-off valve, general tuning and faultfinding. Speaking from experience, it's also the easiest way to identify when a small hose has popped off the intake manifold. Certainly, where possible, go for a boost gauge that shows vacuum.Note that the sweep of the needle is important for viewing accuracy - the greater the sweep, the more likely you'll make a correct reading. Another important factor is the diameter of the gauge - the most common diameter is 52mm, but smaller 40mm units can also be bought. Unless mounting space is an issue (which you'll need to determine before making a purchase) we'd opt for the larger size gauge, as they're considerably easier to read.And what's better - a metric or imperial boost gauge? This comes down mainly to personal preference. Psi (pounds per square inch), kilopascals (kPa) and Bar are the most common pressure units - whichever of these suits you is fine.Your budget will determine whether you'll be using a mechanical or, possibly, an electronic boost gauge. Mechanical boost gauges, which use an internal Bourdin tube, can be bought brand new from as little as $40. Electronic boost gauges, however, can run to several hundred dollars. As the name implies, an electronic boost gauge is fed an electrical signal from a remote pressure sensor. Electronic boost gauges have a few advantages - they generally have slightly better accuracy, most have a peak recall function and, because the gauge is fed an electric signal from a remote pressure sensor, there's no requirement to run an air hose into the cabin.Installing a Mechanical Boost GaugeWhere to Find the Optimal Pressure SourceThe best spot to connect a boost gauge is the intake manifold; most typically by 'T-ing' into one of the existing manifold hoses. So why is the intake manifold best, you ask?First, manifold vacuum won't register on boost/vacuum gauges unless you make a connection downstream of the throttle body (ie inside the intake manifold). Only boost pressure can be measured along the path between the turbocharger and throttle body.The second advantage of connecting the boost gauge to the intake manifold is you'll receive a more accurate representation of actual boost - the amount of positive pressure received by the engine. Connecting a boost gauge anywhere between the turbo compressor and throttle will give a too-high boost reading. Thanks to the inevitable restriction through the intercooler core, intercooler plumbing and throttle body, an engine suffers a boost pressure loss on-route to the manifold.Click for larger image Using a 1994 Subaru Impreza WRX as a demo, we T'd our boost gauge (a second-hand Japanese import job) into one of the hose connections on the topside of the manifold. The hose we selected was one that connects to the purge control solenoid on the underside of the manifold.Note that - instead of cutting the factory solenoid hose - we fitted a T-piece to the existing end and added another short length of hose to hook onto the manifold connection. This means, if we later decide to remove the boost gauge, the original hose will be long enough to reattach to the manifold connection. The third port of the T-piece is dedicated to the boost gauge.And what sort of T-pieces should be used? Brass fittings are certainly the most durable but for a completely stealth installation you can't go past the plastic T-pieces used on 993cc Daihatsu Charade carby turbo engines. We're led to believe that the same T-pieces are fitted to atmo versions as well. These beaut little T-pieces can be picked up from the wreckers for free!To ensure none of your boost gauge hoses pop apart, the vacuum hose clamps used on the Daihatsu Charade Turbo are, again, ideal and available for free. We didn't bother with these since we don't expect to run mega boost.Four millimetre rubber vacuum hose - available from auto parts stores for around $3 per metre - is fine for running from the manifold to the in-cabin gauge. Vacuum hose offers OE-level durability and it integrates into the underbonnet scenery perfectly.Routing the HoseThere are a couple of things to remember when routing the hose from the manifold to the in-cabin gauge. The hose should not be kinked, it should be kept well away from intense heat sources and it should not foul the operation of any moving parts - particularly the throttle!We routed our boost gauge hose around the factory blow-off valve tube, beneath the top-mount intercooler, parallel with some factory tubes that run along the firewall and, finally, though the firewall. A couple of cable ties were used to secure the hose into position.Most cars have several firewall openings that are capped with a rubber or plastic seal; we'll use one of these to pass through our boost hose. Have a good look under the bonnet to find a seal that isn't too crowded with wires and/or cables and prise it away from the firewall using a flat-blade screwdriver - be careful not to strain any wires or cables from inside the car. Next, enlarge the hole in the seal so it's big enough to accept the 4mm rubber hose - this can be done with a pair of pointed scissors or a razor. With that done, refit the seal to the firewall and poke the boost hose through to the cabin.Note - in no circumstance should a hose, cable or electrical wire rub against the metal edge of the firewall hole. Install a firewall seal from another vehicle or use a sheath (even just a short length of rubber hose) to avoid contact with that sharp metal edge.Working from the driver's foot well, route the hose beneath the dashboard so it won't foul the operation of the pedals, steering, handbrake or any other controls. Again, use cable ties to secure the hose at various locations to prevent it falling somewhere it shouldn't - like on your feet while driving! Cut the hose in the vicinity where you intend to mount the gauge.Most boost gauges incorporate a bulb for nighttime illumination. Two electrical terminals can usually be found on the back of the gauge - one for a positive electrical feed and one for Earth. Note that - unless LEDs are used for illumination rather than a conventional bulb - you can hook either terminal to the positive or Earth wire. A conventional bulb is not polarity conscious.So where should you wire the illumination bulb to? Well, the best place is to connect into the existing instrument illumination circuit - this enables the boost gauge to illuminate along with the rest of the vehicle's instruments.In the case of this particular install, we powered the boost gauge bulb from the illumination circuit for the cigarette lighter (which is immediately alongside). We simply T'd into the two wires that are used to illuminate the cigarette lighter surround and ran the appropriate length of hook-up wire to the ashtray area. To enable easy installation and future removal, we soldered two short lengths of wire onto the gauge terminals and adjoined the ends with a pair of spade connectors.Note that most (all?) cars' electrical systems will be able to cope with an extra bulb without being overloaded.

												It used to be a pretty good drifting game. It didn't offer much but what it offered was perfectly acceptable considering the price. Drifting was fun even if it wasn't very challenging or realistic.Now it's a pile of garbage. It may have gotten a lot of new vanity features over time, such as car customization and cosmetic damage, but the physics have been injected with a mixture of realism and steroids that makes it so you literally can not steer your car without rolling it on it's roof.Can not recommend unless you're one of those Let's Players who needs a broken, gimmicky game to make a video of.

												A very good game for the price, 4£ for a basic drifting game with loads of cars and mods. I'm very happy with the experiace with this game works okay with the keybored but better with controller, I dont know about steering wheels but I think it will work fine with them too.If I had to rate this game i would give it a 8/10 just because of the price is so cheap and I would recommend this game to people who are starting out on drifting and not sure if they want to buy a 40£ drifting game.

												*UPDATE*Okay, so my original impression of this game was extremely positive. Price was low, drifting was actually super fun, and it was a fresh idea. Each update brought something new to the game, and I was genuinely enjoying my time with it. After a few months, they started messing with the handling. This is where it went downhill, in my opinion. At first the handling felt like it had some weight to it, and the controls were smooth. Now it feels like you're driving a piece of paper. Trying to hold a line is insanely aggravating, and turning feels extremely touchy. There's a nice bug where you'll barely tap the brakes and your car goes spinning like crazy. Also, it seems like it's damn near impossible to even go in a straight line anymore, so you're constantly fighting with the touchy steering. I'm sure some people still find this game enjoyable, but for me, that ended when they started messing with the handling. I can't play for more than a few minutes without getting annoyed. It's a bit disappointing really. I had high hopes for this game in the beginning, but unfortunately now I can't recommend it, even for $5.ORIGINAL REVIEWFinally a decent attempt at a drifting game. For $7, it's worth it. Even with only an hour into it, it's been super fun. It definitely has its flaws, as will any new game, but hopefully the developers will continue to work on this because it has potential to be awesome.Wish list:- More vehicles- More exterior customization (wheels, headlights, bumpers, skirts, wings, hoods, etc)- Driver (just a moving steering wheel in an empty seat makes the cockpit view lose immersion)- Better sound (car sounds and music come in and out constantly - had to mute the music for now)- Better control over throttle (in auto shifting, throttle response is laggy)- Better collision affects - maybe add an option to toggle collision with other players- Optimization for higher resolutions - playing in 1440p and have a weird box- Move the point indicator to a different position - definitely gets in the way all the time- The option to host a server and options/rules for that server- Customizable speedo and tach (colors, size, position)A big list, yes, but these are things I would definitely like to see out of a game with potential. I would recommend taking a lot of influence from NFS Underground 2 in regards to customization.			",249,21,7,18,17,2,20

												This game is absolute trash. Out of the box the game is unpolished and laggy to inputs, keyboard controls are among the worst out there, and the physics were made by a five year old. Oh, and controller support is essentially non exsistent. Everytime you tail tap a wall, you are instantly 360'd and your multiplier is lost, braking will turn into reverse long before the car has actually stopped. The only good thing about this game is the fact the cars look pretty, thats about it. Do not buy this game, you will regret it.			",70,6,12,10,8,2,1

												I was really stoked to get this game as its simple and fun. I buy and download it and the frame rate is hella low on my PC (Using an HP Pavillion DV6) and maybe its my processor because i have an intel core 2 duo, that might be the only problem because I match the minimum requirements of the game except the processor so I would really appreciate a low graphics setting for us low end users and I know im not the only one who has a weak PC so please help out this low end chunk of the community.Also I would love the addition of different body kits as well as a color menu rather than having to continuously click to get to the color you want. I would also like a custom music player because the standard dubstep songs get old really quick. Different maps would also be appreciated and if the roads can be made smooth rather than having bumps, that would be great. AND OBVIOUSLY FIX THE CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!!!!!! THE CAR JUST DOES A BURNOUT			",18,0,0,0,1,0,0

												this game would be awesom if you didnt slide around on the grass when you hit it...seems like the grass and sand is ice.. one map seemed unfinished because i flew off the map...upgrading parts should is awesome but needs to be more detailed..besides that i like it just needs some tweekingcons: bad breaking system          needs beter selection of cars          more depth on customization          unfinished map          only 3 mapsthe good: very fun even with the cons                 could be a even greater game                 good engine sound                 decent graphics                 not a gpu sucker                 everyone loves drifting games!!

												Until they actually get controller support, this game isnt even worth looking at (i spent 45 minutes trying to figure it out) before giving up and gettin ga refund. A game like this should NOT be this hard to configure for driving, its rediculous. Thus my advice is do NOT bother with this till their is some sort of reasonable controller support.

Its really fun the only downside atm is there is no chat text or voice for online, so for solo que it can get boring after a couple hours of just drifting. Would like to see chat system incorperated soon so we can set up meets, drag races and tandum drifts. Keep up the good work.			",81,2,4,8,1,0,5

												Absolute waste of their money in my opinion, the buttons are all configured wrong from default for me, I'm steering at the same time as bring up the chat box and typing a whole load of ""jansiansiabsiasxuybe ixn"" and so far I have found no solution to this issue, handling is disgraceful, overall lack of effort considering the time it has been on the market. First impression reminded me of an android mobile game.. Very disapointed, I expected ALOT more from this. Graphics are soothing and well presented, sounds are terrible and stuttery. Overall the general idea of the game is great but they've done f***** it :)			",26,1,1,0,1,0,0

												Its a very good game. I like it. I love drifting so if you like drifting and mad camber on your cars this is very good and cheap.There is one significant problem with this game. It is that when I am in multiplayer drifting it goes into the chat if i hold a key for like 5 seconds. Because of that for example when i accelerate for a turn it goes into chat for no reason and it basically ruins my drift by making me not controlling my car, but writing into chat. After the dev fixes that bug it's going to be a perfect game for drifting fans. Thanks for reading this review!			",19,1,3,0,19,0,1

												While this game is on Steam, it's safe to say Valve is totally fine if you steal the assets. None of these cars are original and there is no way this tricky kid could license more cars than the older NFSes had. Shake it, gaben. Also game physics are completely ducked up - you can launch yourself into the sky to gain loads of cash.			",606,148,26,66,36,11,80

												This game was gifted to me from a mate who was generous enough to buy it for me knowing that I loved my Cars. This game is honest good. but need alot of work. What can be improved:- Keyboard controls! omGHASDHASH So bad, still needs work!- The controll settings window. HOOMMGMGG. It's really bad and needs alot of attention to get working good because the state it is in right now is just shocking. unable to chane joystick to keyboards? what?- The new ""Manual Clutch"" feature where the button makes the car rev up to redline even when you llet go of the gas/accelerator and clutch in again :/I'll add more to this list when I find them.

												My honest review of this game. When I first saw this game it was on some youtubers profile, the game looked meh to me. But i'm sceptical about ""drift"" games (please regard shovelware on android and ios). Then It was featured on steam sales, at full price though. So I decided to check it out.As the trailer started to play the first thing I noticed was the anti lag- rev limiter back fire (machinegun fire). This was the reason that I wanted to give it a try. For 7€. Loads of cars (for a beginning game) Great Icons and lots of tuning options. Engine swaps do fully mean another engine (my V8 240 sx is a beast) Engines are in par with their real life counterparts. This game still needs lots of content, but for 7€ This thing rocks. I love drifting and I drift in every racinggame. Thus to say this is a fun little drift game with loads of updates every few days!-update- Just managed to pull a + 15 000 000 points drift. I'm hapy.			",142,21,15,6,12,1,10

												This game has turned into one of my favorite time wasters. The concept is simple but to fully control your car it really takes a little time to figure out. Making money early on in the game can be hard but once you build your first car a little you can start to really bring in good money. The engine swaps and engine mods are what really keep me coming back. If you can get past the odd control scheme and not 100% accurate car and engine sounds this is an amazing game for the low price tag.			",16,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game is broken. From what everyone else is saying, it sounds like the developer is busy making a new game and the chances of them returning to fix this are slim. I do like the car variety and it's moderate accuracy on engines, specs, etc., but customization is lacking and gameplay is awful. I managed to roll a stock 'S240' at ~60km/h which translates to 37mp/h.			",20,0,0,4,1,0,1

												Game has been out for so long and still no working controller support, devs dont seem to give a crap at all about what people thing and just want the money they are getting from it. Dont understand how this game can have so many positive comments, when half the forum discussions is about controller and other issues. When you get past the controller not working at all and resort to using the keyboard, the latest update has also stuffed up the game even more as any side ways sliding, will guarantee the car flipping and doing barrel rolls.

												Alright, firstly I bought this game to play with friends. My short description, this game is the worst single-player driving experience ever. There is no good about it, there's no ability to play alone. There's only one option and that's a green ""Play"" button that takes you to a server list or create your own server with barely any settings to tweak it.I have played a lot of driving games since I've been born with a PS1, arcade, simulation, all the such and playing this game? It's worst than a PS1 driving game. I'd rather play a GameBoy pixel driver game than this. Also, notice how I never said racing, because there is none. Unless you and a friend set up a race on, so far, a count of four tracks that actually connect back to the start. I think there's six tracks in total right now but I'm not willing to play the game without taking a few shots so I barely pay attention to begin with.This game isn't a good drifting experience, it's not a good racing experience, it doesn't even drive right for an arcade title. I would rather spend two dollars at an actual arcade and play Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift arcade machine, than playing this. But, and it's a very weak excuse to actual play the game more than I have before, I only enjoy it when I'm playing with a friend or two. That is it, it's barely a good party racer. We laugh at how many bugs are in the game than we actually tandem drift. I'm not willing to list off how many bugs, bad design decisions, let alone how bad of a game it is. How it got on Steam is beyond my knowledge. If I gave this game a score it would be -1/10 it doesn't even compete with arcade racing games from the 90's			",65,9,9,8,18,1,0

												controller set up is useless, no way of re setting controller/ keyboard config. basically buy the game and figure it out yourself atitude. would not recomend unless you like driving with a keyboard. once they sort using a controller for the game then would 100% recomend, until then i wouldn't bother with this game (if they ever decide to listen to what people want). waste of time and money			",6,1,2,0,0,0,0

												I actually refunded this game. It's pretty interesting for an hour at the most, but then after a bit it's dreadful to play. There are so many bugs and glitches, and there isn't much to do unless you enjoy spending hours just drifting the same corners over and over again. Also, there are many easy ways to hack money, so everyone on the servers have the best car, and it makes it boring to race.			",31,5,6,3,3,0,4

												This is one of the better car games on steam.  This game as you could tell by the title is a drifting game. This game can get very boring pretty quick, its a game that you play for like 30-40 min at a time(maybe even less). As i read the complaints about how hard it is to drift and how they changed the physics, it makes me go well no♥♥♥♥♥♥ it takes time to get good at this game and its not a fully finished product, they're still working on making this game great.

												Very nice game love every min of it. If you are into drifting on Carx Drift, Forza Motorsports Or Horizon you will like this. Only complaint is the Deacceleration response is known existent. Would like to see better tire grip physics, and gearing response changes. Right now it feels like every gear is ice with the higher gears being the iciest off limits. The brakes don't feel very confident I find my self guessing if they will do the job or I have to much speed for them to and understeer. The boost effects and engine responses are spot on though. Drifting low power cars feel way more realistic then Horizon or Forza.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND SUPPORTING THIS!!!!			",39,0,1,1,2,0,4

												First off, it's one of the only and few car drifting games on Steam. It's also not a garbage can, but it would be nice if it wouldn't freeze randomly during gameplay. The graphics are decent, but some cars need some word in the 3d modeling. Some front bumpers are wider the the fenders at the joinpoints, as if it is a widebody front bumper but noone botherd doing the fenders. Also, if you like tons of power, camber, and antilag backfire at rev limiter, then this game is for you.Here's some pro's and cons:PROS-Inital D (I think?) style graphicsGreat suspension tuning (Offset and Camber)Bad color choice possibilityWell designed tyre/tire smokeMultiplayerLevel EditorCONS-Crashes/Freezes/Stops responding during gameplay randomlyMultiplayer spawn car collidence issuesNo cosmetic modifactions (Other then wheels, and not many at that!)No custom colorsNo bodypanel editing (Removing bumpers, bonnets/hoods, etc.)My overall score would be 7/10. It's a great addition to your collection for 7$/five pounds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												JDM4iK you really made it, congratulations. I brought this game about a month and a half ago, at first it looked like a game full of potential but with not much to offer. After having a doubt for a day or 2 i finally decided that any game with a decent few cars and a few different maps was worth the small price of 5 pounds. i remember the first time i played it, i must of spent 2 hours on a row in the game, the game was so good and brought back some amazing memories back to when i was building my now 320BHP 180sx. i remember getting 4M drift score and losing it all on a wall cause the brakes where waay too weak. i remember buying that beautiful spirit R as its my dream car, i feel in love with it and since then is my favourite car. I recorded every step of the way, update by update to one day look back to  the beginning of this Amazing game. i knew by the regular updates that by time the game will only get better, but i had no idea it could happen so fast and for that im grateful JDM4iK. Just keep doing what you do and people get ready for the Best Racing game to ever hit pc :D good luck.PS: I can not wait to see them awesome bodykits on my cars and a few new rims. also i think we kinda need more upgrades and being able to tune the car, not big things. only necessaries and basic things that a real drifter would need to drift his car. a 1KBhp would be awesome to have and finally that really needed controller support :D I feel like im writing to Santa here haha but i have faith :D peace Mfukas!!!

												My honest review of this game. When I first saw this game it was on some youtubers profile, the game looked meh to me. But i'm sceptical about ""drift"" games (please regard shovelware on android and ios). Then It was featured on steam sales, at full price though. So I decided to check it out.As the trailer started to play the first thing I noticed was the anti lag- rev limiter back fire (machinegun fire). This was the reason that I wanted to give it a try. For 7€. Loads of cars (for a beginning game) Great Icons and lots of tuning options. Engine swaps do fully mean another engine (my V8 240 sx is a beast) Engines are in par with their real life counterparts. This game still needs lots of content, but for 7€ This thing rocks. I love drifting and I drift in every racinggame. Thus to say this is a fun little drift game with loads of updates every few days!-update- Just managed to pull a + 15 000 000 points drift. I'm hapy.			",142,21,15,6,12,1,10

												The game has potential, but is not fully complete physics wise.It seems to me, that the tyre grip model has been made in a weird way - The car has to be a certain deg sideways for the wheels to start spinning, when you go straight, the wheels will not spin, even if you clutchkick. When you let go of the throttle, car starts acting very weird and grips instantly, making it nearly impossible to chain different drifts or to end one unless you are living on the handbrake 24/7 (still making it very hard to stop a drift).This is pretty much the only negative side to the game, but has a huge impact on gameplay, really something to be sorted out in the future (i hope so atleast)I really hope developers read this, because this game is unique in a way, just needs to be optimized to fulfill it's goal properly :)			",11,0,2,4,3,1,0

												In the really early stages of development. Overall very fun experience, though also very lean.Was able to open up track editor to a blank track, and do a 20 minute donut and have enough money to buy any car, plus maxed upgrades. Maybe fix that?			",210,40,5,20,23,1,20

												A game that has so much that can be added and done to make this one of the best drift games currently on market. It has easy and simple controls to use and takes little to no time to learn how to control the drifts and how to actualy drift. game is constantly getting updated and adding new things that makes the game worth comming back to, at its current state i would recommend this game as its so cheap for the amount of fun you will have on single player, mutiplayer and lan. so many cars to chose from and the amount to add is crazy, tune the car to how you want it and make it look rice;)			",74,3,2,2,2,0,0

												So, I recently picked this game up. Purchased it on a whim when it was on sale. And to be honest, it is a lot of fun. The mechanics are a little buggy, and the updates take awhile to come out. But behind that, is a great drifting game. You can throw some of your favorite JDM cars around corners at ridiculous angles. And people are always online (at least in my area), and they are all pretty friendly. Not a whole lot of trolls. I would say, if you want to support the dev (single developer) and be in it for the long haul. This game is worth the purchase. If you don't want to deal with broken states, and buggy updates. This game may not be your cup of tea. I'm looking forward to all that's to come, and will continue to put more hours into this game.			",28,3,5,14,13,0,2

												The game is decent I suppose, but has one major flaw that makes it pretty much impossible to play. The irritating auto-gas setting makes it near impossible to play.

												I'll start by saying I love his game. I play on the keyboard. It's definitely not the best but the community is good. The modding support is great. I have so much fun. If you like cars even remotely this is a great buy for 7 bucks. The drifting isn't he most realistic but you can still do some pretty fantastic things. The customization while in a sense limited, it is more than enough to keep me entertained. Just get it. No it's not a finished game. No it's not a ""simulator"" but people.. Don't be so judge mental. You'll have fun if you're not picky and like to enjoy a game. Built on cars. And the beauty of a machine.			",7,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Although I've played this game for only almost an hour, this is my review:It's a ""meh"" for now but I definitely recommend this game for drift lovers out there. When I first saw the gameplay on Youtube, I insta-bought this game because the price was reasonable with the quality of the game at that time. -The graphics is not great but it isn't that bad in my opinion. -The controls with kb/m is okay but it's quite horrible with a gamepad. In my case, a Wireless Logitech gamepad.-The physics are arcadey, a bit sim, but definitely arcadey. But it's enjoyable and far better than the drifting physics from Grid 2 or Autosport.I haven't tried multiplayer yet but I totally wasn't expecting multiplayer at this early stage of development. Which is good I guess. I did a few setup customizations to my cars but I can't remember what I did exactly or how the customizations was like. I'll get back to this review and edit this post later tonight after I spend some more time with this game.But as of now, I definitely recommend you to buy this game as the price is quite reasonable and the game seems more and more promising after every few updates.

												10/10 Probably one of the best driving games on the Steam market.Currently driving a 2006 Subaru WRX with a F20C swapped into it (90s Honda Accord Motor.)Additionally the motor swap customization, camber and offset options are beyond a majority of flagship titles available right now.I have only sunk a handful of hours into this game and I have quite an extensive garage already unlocked, featuring many vehicles with various and ridiculous engine swaps already installed. (Example: LS1 swapped Nissan 240SX (S13) or 2JZ swapped Mazda RX-7 FD3S)For the $7.79 CAD that this game demands, I don't think the money can be better spent!			",134,15,12,25,13,3,9

												11/10 Rotorarys do not exist. )"":I have already unlocked all the cars,In an amount of total 5 game play hours. Very easy to pick up contorller support isnt really needed idk y people keep crying about itusing key boardkeys is fine enough i managed to get used to it and began to handle very well. I already reached a highscore of 16 millionnow im waiting on the dev to add more content.Currently u can only paint the car and the rims.(Things id like to see in the game)Body kitsDecal/vinyl editorWide selection of rimsMost importantly more cars and engine swaps (hopefully a rotorary so  i can brapapapapapap)NOTE.Has auto counter steer which gets annoyingThis game is a cellphone to PC portGraphics are low res because of that, but it appears that its being worked on by the dev.At its current state i give it 8/10Mechanics are ok along with the physics which can be worked on			",58,8,1,5,6,0,3

												Although I've played this game for only almost an hour, this is my review:It's a ""meh"" for now but I definitely recommend this game for drift lovers out there. When I first saw the gameplay on Youtube, I insta-bought this game because the price was reasonable with the quality of the game at that time. -The graphics is not great but it isn't that bad in my opinion. -The controls with kb/m is okay but it's quite horrible with a gamepad. In my case, a Wireless Logitech gamepad.-The physics are arcadey, a bit sim, but definitely arcadey. But it's enjoyable and far better than the drifting physics from Grid 2 or Autosport.I haven't tried multiplayer yet but I totally wasn't expecting multiplayer at this early stage of development. Which is good I guess. I did a few setup customizations to my cars but I can't remember what I did exactly or how the customizations was like. I'll get back to this review and edit this post later tonight after I spend some more time with this game.But as of now, I definitely recommend you to buy this game as the price is quite reasonable and the game seems more and more promising after every few updates.

												This game has great potential, with a variety of cars and customiztion options (more to come soon as well) it is certainly a promosing game. However due to a laggy multiplayer and drifting physics that are somewhat questionable at time, especially with a keyboard i sadly had to refund the game but will be happy to re purchase once said probelms are fixed.

												I havent played much of this game, however it is quite a decent indie/early access game.The graphics are decent, the sounds arent too shabby and the mechanics are both simple to get the hang of but can takea while for the inexperienced to master.However.The engine swaps are a little bit umm. excessive.Swapping an ls1 into a honda civic.Realisticly this is a swap that would not be possible without futher chassis strengthening upgrades.there are many instances in the game where in reality this would be a problem.However being in a game its completely understandable.So in the future, I would like to see alot more depth to the swaps IE swaybars roll cages, just to help add to the authenticity.but overall a fantastic time waster with almost limitless potential  :)			",63,0,2,7,13,0,4

												First and for most this game is worth every penny.Bought this off the back of watching videos of it on youtube. So for £5 thought hey lets try. Read reviews from people playing only 0.1 or 0.2 hours and saying its bad. Far from it.At the time of this review i have played near enough 6 solid hours. And must say im still loving it! I would say a good hour is needed into the game to get some upgrades and learn the handling to make it more fun! Ive played many driving games over the years and modded games to enable drifting. But for once to jump straight into a drift game is nice.Pro's: Good selection of cars (so far)Good tuning optionsCar graphic quality TURBO FLUTTEREase of earning moneyCon's:Some maps can be a bit glitchyLoose points from hitting bumps every so slightly (would like to see improved)Aside that its a £5 drifting game! Cant expect loads from it! Hope the work and updates continue as they have and look forward to the future!			",32,3,3,3,11,0,4

												I absolutely love this game. Sure it's got it's pro's and con's, but in my opinion, the vast amount of different ways you can tune your cars settings weighs out the con's. People who gave this game a negative review likely didn't play it long enough to understand the game, and actually think on how they can make the game be fun for them.I love all of the tune settings, not the upgrades, but the tiny changes you can make to your wheels, grip settings, drive load options (4WD / RWD / FWD / etc). Each settings literally plays a large role in how your car handles, you can't create a ""perfect setup"". Because every setup has its flaws because that's just how things roll, you can however master your setup to allow your car to drift the way you want it to. Whether realistic drift (which I prefer) or ice drifting for Tandems.(All my opinions, I've got a pretty fair amount of hours within the game, and knowledge about things under the hood of the game.)Pros:Fair amount of car optionsEach setting when Tuning your car plays a noticeable roleMore than fair amount of players still playingVery mature players, hardly any xbox kidsFriendly community, Drag Race events, Drift races, Tandems, etc.only 5$, like seriously. It's just 5$.Nice looking bodykits for certain carsAbility to create your own mapsAbility to use modded vehicles and maps (modded vehicles as in vehicles created or imported by other players)Fair racing wheel support (Logitech G27 is the most popular and best working apprently)Large community within ForumsGAME IS NOT ABANDONED (DEVELOPER IS ON A VACATION TRIP, CHILL OUT PEEPS)Fair amount of maps to choose fromEasy to use hotkeys (Reset Key, Autosteering Toggle, Repair Vehicle, etc)Tofu Hachi Roku (puts on shades)Auto Countersteering can be disabled through recent updates (THANK GOD)Collision is Disabled (Helps prevent pesky trolls from messing up your sick driftz)Cons:Physics can be wonkey when hitting walls at certain anglesMoney can be fairly hard to earn by purely drifting alone (Which most people end up Registry editing their money and then claim they drifted all of it)Small amount of body kits and style features for small number of cars.Engine sounds can get a little tedious to listen to (especially if you're redlining the absolute F*CK OUT OF IT FOR THAT SICK DRIFT)Akina map is very rough and can't be properly drifted on at highspeeds, or even medium speeds :(Few rim stylesVery basic colors to choose from for rims and the car body (would love to be able to put Vinyl designs) ",59,7,4,7,4,0,0

												It looks amazing, great sounds tracks, but the gameplay is not even close to feeling finished. It is boring just because there  is nothing to do but play like 5 really basic maps and everything feels extremely slow.I like the fact that it is difficult just because it gives you something to practice but what is the point of practicing if there is a glitch that gives you infinite money and unlock everything instantly. You ""Beat"" the game unlockable wise in just 3 minutes. Customizability is amazing but yet again unfinished. The parts to the cars are amazing, but sadly there are only body kits for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cars.Overall I would not buy this game unless it was ~$5UPDATE: It seems JDM4IK is SLOWLY updating this game but i assume that is because he has a lot on his hands. I still reccomend the game if you are into good looking drifting games with difficult physics. Also i have discovered the forum pages with many car mods so a good community is always a bonus. I changed my review to a thumbs up for these reasons.			",223,34,11,8,15,5,7

												this game IF IT ACTUALLY HAD ANY controller support it would be amazing as i had it working untill the update, and still having problems with the car customizability not being able to visually mod most vehicles! well worth spending the money if this problem is sorted out! tried multiple controller support programs (bought/free programs)  and had close results no but cigar! please sort out your inputs so they dont use regestry editor rather then the traditional .ini input file (i only Recommend it IF INPUT PROBLEMS SORTED)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you don't mind russians, fantastic game. At first i thought this was more arcady (which it is, a little) but know i think its more of a fun simulatorish. The tuning factor is fantastic. My friends and I like to rice out civics and 350z's. Car selection is great. Overall good game			",27,0,4,1,5,0,1

												The game got amazing graphic and good physx, it even supports steeringwheel + controller (xbox360 what I've tested). I wonder tho if they're going to update the game because there's only a few maps and you can only drift around. I think it would be cool if the feature where you can race against others around a map.			",108,4,4,14,13,2,10

												Not in any shape or form is this the best out there. The handling is shoddy and there's no definitive controller support, and a whole lot of content in the game.Now, in the 4 hours I've put into this game, I loved it. This game has loads of potential. It has a decent selection of vehicles and engines you can put into them for where the game is at development wise, and they recently started adding bodykits to cars (only 2 cars have them so far). My biggest pet peeve of mine is the handling. It's almost as if you're on ice. That, along with no guarunteed controller support and no clutch, is the only things I find wrong with it right now.Is it worth the $7? Maybe not. Maybe it is, since new content is being added with almost every update.			",128,15,29,4,15,4,3

												Ok. Let's start off with the cons:-Cannot play low-res fullscreen or the fittment doesn't work.-Primitive graphics options, can't lower texture details and model quality etc.-Terrible controller support.-Lag for days.-Can't look backwards.-Not every car has bodykits.-Can't shift into neutral and do backfiring.Now, the pros:+Great graphics.+Cars drift amazing with the keyboard.+Tuning aspect of the game is amazing.+Turbo spooling and BOV are freakin' crazy. Nobody has ever had such audio.+Really immersive.+Multiplayer.+Tandems.+Track editors.+Manual gearbox.Bottom line. Game has pretty noticable flaws which made me want to get a refund, but, after that I learned to appreciate the good things and ignore the bad ones. Remember, the game didn't really have a big budget at the start. I say it was worth the 7 euros.			",46,1,5,7,8,0,1

												its a fun game, easy to gain money to buy mods, but what i dont like about it is the fact it does auto turning which you have to fight against on corners, the e-brake is useless as♥♥♥♥♥♥on a bull because if you hit it to get a slide happening, 100% of the time you will end up against a wall and loose your points, turns too early on a corner, hit the wall, turn too late, hit the wall, have too much power, hit the wall.... best thing you can do is keep the car near stock to get maximum points... apart from the slight control issues its a good game but plenty of room for improvement			",44,20,27,1,20,1,2

												Game has been out for so long and still no working controller support, devs dont seem to give a crap at all about what people thing and just want the money they are getting from it. Dont understand how this game can have so many positive comments, when half the forum discussions is about controller and other issues. When you get past the controller not working at all and resort to using the keyboard, the latest update has also stuffed up the game even more as any side ways sliding, will guarantee the car flipping and doing barrel rolls.

(Nitpick)All in all, I think Drift Streets Japan is a very good and fun game, has interesting and addicting gameplay.			",111,6,7,9,14,1,1

												While this game is on Steam, it's safe to say Valve is totally fine if you steal the assets. None of these cars are original and there is no way this tricky kid could license more cars than the older NFSes had. Shake it, gaben. Also game physics are completely ducked up - you can launch yourself into the sky to gain loads of cash.			",606,148,26,66,36,11,80

												I know I don't have much hours on this game but I would like the write a review. First of all, you get what you pay for with this game (physics wise). The physics with drifting are very annoying especially since there is no controller support yet, you  don't feel confident as you enter a drift and it always tries to snap you the other way. It is quite annoying and on maps with long, swinging corners this isn't ideal. That being said, this game is only 7 dollars and you get a lot for what you pay for, there is upwards of 10 cars that you can modify to your liking. They have camber and wheel spacing as well as a bunch of colors for the body and wheels. You are also able to do mad engine swaps, for example I have a fully built 2jz that has about 700 bhp plus nitrous. You are able to choose headers, turbos, nitrous, ecu, exhaust, and much more. There is even multiplayer to play with other people or friends. Though the multiplayer is laggy since there is only one server you can't really risk more than a 2 person tandem since the car movements update every few seconds. It is very choppy and most people run into you and make you flip over. Overall, this game has very little flaws (the flaws though are big ones) minus the buggy multiplayer, and physics of the car there are a lot of veriety in cars and upgrades. If the developer changed some of the physics to not be as annoying and better multiplayer, they could easily sell this game for another 10 dollars more. Overall it gives you alot for a game that only costs 7 dollars. But, don't complain to much because you have to remember this is a new indie game and there are many bugs still being worked out.

Very easy to pick up contorller support isnt really needed idk y people keep crying about itusing key boardkeys is fine enough i managed to get used to it and began to handle very well. I already reached a highscore of 16 millionnow im waiting on the dev to add more content.Currently u can only paint the car and the rims.(Things id like to see in the game)Body kitsDecal/vinyl editorWide selection of rimsMost importantly more cars and engine swaps (hopefully a rotorary so  i can brapapapapapap)NOTE.Has auto counter steer which gets annoyingThis game is a cellphone to PC portGraphics are low res because of that, but it appears that its being worked on by the dev.At its current state i give it 8/10Mechanics are ok along with the physics which can be worked on			",58,8,1,5,6,0,3

												Although I've played this game for only almost an hour, this is my review:It's a ""meh"" for now but I definitely recommend this game for drift lovers out there. When I first saw the gameplay on Youtube, I insta-bought this game because the price was reasonable with the quality of the game at that time. -The graphics is not great but it isn't that bad in my opinion. -The controls with kb/m is okay but it's quite horrible with a gamepad. In my case, a Wireless Logitech gamepad.-The physics are arcadey, a bit sim, but definitely arcadey. But it's enjoyable and far better than the drifting physics from Grid 2 or Autosport.I haven't tried multiplayer yet but I totally wasn't expecting multiplayer at this early stage of development. Which is good I guess. I did a few setup customizations to my cars but I can't remember what I did exactly or how the customizations was like. I'll get back to this review and edit this post later tonight after I spend some more time with this game.But as of now, I definitely recommend you to buy this game as the price is quite reasonable and the game seems more and more promising after every few updates.

												Well where do I start. It's a game about drifting and it doesn't even have controller support. I mean, yes you can plug in your controller and try to use it, but the controls are terrible (auto-throttle that doesn't even work properly, some controls are completely missing etc), and the keyboard controls are near impossible to use. The physics are just completely terrible. You spin out every 2 seconds, and if you go off the gas you just lose your drift completely. You wanna use the brake? Free flight to mars. Most of the stuff in the game is ripped off from somewhere else (an entire track for example). If you want some fun drifting on pc, please don't buy this game, there are way better variants like rFactor, Asetto Corsa, Live For Speed. This game did not bring me a single bit of fun, all it did is frustrate me. I spent more time in the ingame overlay trying to figure out how to fix the game, than actually playing it. The only thing that is barely acceptable is the Car customization (body mods for 3 different cars. wow!). It feels like I've been scammed (thank god for refunds). I give this a 2/10 because at least they tried...... and still did a bad job.			",32,1,3,0,2,0,1

												It was fun but the most recent physics update to make keyboard controls better kinda screwed the whole experience for me so i do suggest it but i also suggest waiting for alot more updates first because its buggy unfinished and content is probably the last thing that this game needs right now, yes alot of cars are still in need of bodykits and yes we need slightly more finished tracks but having tracks and cool cars  means nothing if you cant drive them properly so what the game needs before i recomend you buy are1:proper physics(probably gunna take awhile considering the tune settings in the game eg. cambre)2:proper controller support3:pollished tracks(or more tracks after they polish the current ones)3.5:the ability to play custom tracks made in the editor online4:the ability to turn on and off the damn steering assists(i hate when a game countersteers for me)(and yes i know you can press tab to do it but it essentially just changes the type of assist it doesnt turn it off also u cant really tell wether its on or off you just kidna press tab over and over again till you got it the way you like it)5:bodykits for all the cars(this can come last hence why its number 5 cause it would just be cool to have)			",68,8,5,13,4,0,2

												its a great game and all but why cant we check our controls? and we need conroller support in this, plus theres a glitch where if you hold the brake on the 360 controller it launches your car off in random directions, could you also make it so we could adjust our front and rear wheel size independently, my F40 looks kinda stupid with the front wheels through the hood and the back fitting perfectly, also could you add a dodge Hemi engine along with a Ford coyote engine please? also please bring back the grip adjuster. and fix the display, my screen isnt centered anymore in full screen since the update			",35,11,6,1,5,1,1

												Loved the game to mess around with friends and just jump on it for a drift sesh. Got used to old physics and whole butter on pan control but after 2.5.0 came out, it was annoying but after mastering, a game changer, so much smoother and more satisfying + rewarding after you learn how to do it. However 2.6.0 brought back old physics and just doesnt feel right anymore. Still love the game but can't get on for a chill sesh as before after having a taste of 2.5.0 physics.

												This game is absolute trash. Out of the box the game is unpolished and laggy to inputs, keyboard controls are among the worst out there, and the physics were made by a five year old. Oh, and controller support is essentially non exsistent. Everytime you tail tap a wall, you are instantly 360'd and your multiplier is lost, braking will turn into reverse long before the car has actually stopped. The only good thing about this game is the fact the cars look pretty, thats about it. Do not buy this game, you will regret it.			",70,6,12,10,8,2,1

												My honest review of this game. When I first saw this game it was on some youtubers profile, the game looked meh to me. But i'm sceptical about ""drift"" games (please regard shovelware on android and ios). Then It was featured on steam sales, at full price though. So I decided to check it out.As the trailer started to play the first thing I noticed was the anti lag- rev limiter back fire (machinegun fire). This was the reason that I wanted to give it a try. For 7€. Loads of cars (for a beginning game) Great Icons and lots of tuning options. Engine swaps do fully mean another engine (my V8 240 sx is a beast) Engines are in par with their real life counterparts. This game still needs lots of content, but for 7€ This thing rocks. I love drifting and I drift in every racinggame. Thus to say this is a fun little drift game with loads of updates every few days!-update- Just managed to pull a + 15 000 000 points drift. I'm hapy.			",142,21,15,6,12,1,10

												Im not an expert at drifting, but I really love this game. It's kind of hard to get used to the drifting, but it's an awesome game. It's really fun to customize your car, tune it, and upgrade it. Overall it's a great game and I hope the developers keep on updating it.			",100,11,6,15,8,0,8
