												This game is not bad. It feels like ExciteBike at times, and in good, good ways. The controls are good (keyboard at least) and the feel of controlling is pretty much right-on. The style, graphics, and general components of making a game come alive are all there.But there's one big no-go for me, which is the presentation. The concept is fine. A bit dull, but fine. However, there are insufferable cut scenes that are neither helpful nor entertaining, that cannot be skipped. These go on for far, far longer than they need to. This is a game about riding a vehicle, jumping or ducking, and trying to spin as much as possible before you hit the ground again. The story (really, not much going on in that department) is such a thin, forgettable thing, that there is no need for a single cutscene, let alone several.There are tips and tricks screens and bubbles throughout the game, but they are often shown at the tail-end of a cutscene when you are already either frustrated or have tuned out, and after several minutes of irrelevant blather, the useful information is displayed just long enough to recognize what's happening. But before you can read the part about playing the game that could end up helping you, it is gone. It's the Keyser Soze of a hint-screen.When I finally reach the gameplay, there is a fun, balanced, entertaining game underneath. But the shiny, overdone, obnoxious, and person-who-invited-themself-over-and-hasn't-figured-out-it's-time-to-go-home-already atmosphere of all the parts of this game that are not actually the playing of it, really, really sour me on it.I would heartily recommend this if you like the ExciteBike gameplay and don't mind making a sandwich while the cutscenes play. But instead of waiting for my game to let me play it, I'll probably just move on to something else.			",284,73,9,35,25,3,54

												Joe Danger 2 improves upon the first game by adding more vehicles and other ways of transportation. I don't know what to tell you about it really. If you played the first one this one is very similar. Yes, the different vehicles add more variety to the game, but it's still all about collecting stars, letters and other collectibles, while performing as many stunts as you can. Except this time, the whole game is set on a movie set. Even the graphics look the same, with just slightly more variation. Also, the game performs much, much better than the first one. The first one had some annoying frame drops, but JD2 runs at a solid 60FPS at all times. But this Joe occasionally has some frustrating levels with not enough checkpoints.In the end Joe Danger 2 still isn't very long if you don't like to collect stuff, but if you do you're in for a treat. It's a great game, just don't expect too much new stuff. However, if it's your first Joe you have nothing to worry about. Just enjoy the ride ![Rating: 77/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												This review is for the Mac port only.While Joe Danger 2 seems to be an amazing game, the shortcomings of the Mac port ruin it for me.There are two major problems, both caused by the game's launcher overlay.1. Inability to choose full screen mode. Why I'm only left with ""Windowed"" mode is beyond me, as the game lists proper resolutions for my display to choose as window size.2. The game recognizes my Logitech Rumblepad 2 controller, however the buttons simply don't work, just the X/Y controls. I'm sure this is something that could easily be fixed if the game had a control setup option. It does have one, in the launcher, ONLY for the keyboard. In the game itself you're only presented with a screen that ""explains"" the controls with no option to re-bind them.Some may argue that it's tricky to port games to a different OS, but with games like Rogue Legacy that handle controller support on Mac impeccably, there's just no room for excuse anymore.Full controller support? Not true.All I can say is, I'm really glad I got this game as part of The Humble Indie Bundle X, because if I got this at full price I'd be furious right now.			",403,133,16,22,39,6,63

												As a completionist, this game infuriates me. I feel like this game doesn't accommodate for the hardcore audience, even though the game has included 'Pro Medals' for players who strive to achieve every task in a level.  There is usually too much going on screen, making it difficult to comprehend what is relevant on most of the time. Some levels are crippled by this feature, because you must remember every part of the level in order to achieve the tasks. I don't see any possibility of a player completing some levels during their first try, regardless of skill, because there is no time to react appropriately.  Other levels task you to '100% combo', which entails performing consecutive tricks through the whole level with only a short period between each, or risk losing the combo and needing to restart. This poses a rather annoying problem, as the buttons for tricks need to be held for a particular amount of time, and in the case of the 360 controller, mapped to the very inconvenient bumpers; which is frustrating because you're typically trying to control your speeds with the triggers at the same time.  I also feel like the game doesn't teach you to play correctly; the are some moments within the early levels where there are collectibles just out of reach, I still don't know how to obtain them, and I've made it up to the final chapter of the game.  I'm not going to go into details about the messy UI, or the pathetic progression methods, or gameplay inconsistency, or this review will be far too long. There are not many redeeming qualities for this game, maybe some younger children will enjoy it, but I do not recommend this game. I obtained this game as part of a Humble Bundle pack; If I purchased it individually, I would be asking the Steam staff for a full refund.			",254,49,5,37,21,5,29

												I quite enjoyed this game. I've played the main for 100% completion in about 11 hours, having done all the challenges in the game. I really like the music they have in this game. While I'm personally not really a completionist at all, this game did get me motivated to collect all there is to collect.If you are really into speedrunning or score attack games, than this game offers you that and you'll probably really enjoy this game. It offers you ghosts from other people and your own best run to use a reference. I recommend using a joypad though, because keyboard controls just sems a bit too confusing (or at least, for me that was the case). You race through an obstacle couse with some challenges (like doing a whole combo for the full length of the level or collecting all the collectables in the level), you have a nitro to give yourself a speedboost and to some arial tricks with and you can do some simple stunts to fill you nitro meter up again. You can race in various vehicles: a minekart/buggy, motorcycle, mono-wheel and a jetpack, each with their own handling (althoug the 4 wheeled and 2 wheeled vehicles feel a bit similar in my oppinion).Don't get fooled by the multiplayer aspect of this game. They are probaly referring to the leaderboards. There is actually some form of multi-player gameplay, but it's just bad (and only local, not via LAN or the internet) and I strongly recommend ignoring it exists or is mentioned on the store page. Neither should you get fooled by the 'many characters' in the game: they are just skins (and some with some voiceovers) and the game does not always remember which one you used the last time. And sadly, the ghosts are not available in the skin you've played with: they are just orbs of magical stuff in various colors.There is also a level editor and it seems easy to use. I haven't really bothered with it too much, because it's not really my kind of thing. But for people into challenging games and wanting to create a challenge for other people to enjoy: this is it! One thing though: the dev's decided that it was a good idea to force the level editor tutorials down your throught in order to get 100% completion. A decision I frown upon...Nevertheless, I really enjoyed myself with this game. And I think a lot of other people can do to.			",208,31,0,37,22,0,61

												it's a glorified runner with what amounts to a Quick Time Events-based gameplay.  So if you're into that (and why would you be?) i guess this game is for you.  I would still recommend this even with its fundamental flaw, based solely on its charming aesthetics.  The name of the levels are punny if not satirical. and the different vehicles and collectibles keeps the gameplay interesting enough to keep you playing the game, at least until you don't have nearly enough stars to unlock the next level.  Haven't yet tried the multiplayer, but that looks promising.PIck it up if it's on sale.			",456,143,12,53,31,6,96

												A quirky and oddly compelling score attack/Leaderboarding Racing game. Controls are tight and responsive, and Mission objective vary from every set, to almost every level.Also the music is great. Bought it on Soundtrack. Be warned however, having a controller while playing is prudent. It's easier to keep track of what you need to be doing.			",310,55,10,46,33,3,47

												Fun game, but takes a while to get used to. Its a runner-style game, but with much more action per second, and some variety of levels and actions performed (including, but not limited to: riding bikes, cars, jetpack, unicycle, fighting bosses, surviving bosses, time attack levels ect). Controls are hard at first (jump, duck, fly down - all on one button, Space, quite unusual), may work better with a controller (I have one, but have a hard time using it, I'm a keyboard person).Most of the game (about 80% of all levels) are quite doable and fun. Last few levels (Director's cut) are a nightmare. Timing required is insanely precise, and controls don't always work the way they're supposed to (or so it seems). Retrying doesn't take much time, which is good.Game play is repetitive, level pieces start repeating over time. You can help this by making your own levels, or downloading community-made levels (and uploading yours).Music is good. The mood of the game is good. Some achievements are quite hard, but I'm sure its all doable (some require DLC, though).Recommended for fun. Same-screen multiplayer is available, most of the game is nice and fun.

												Probably my favorite sidescrolling runner game. The stuntman setting is cute and funny, and it allows you to explore a bunch of different enviroments by going through various ""movie sets"". There's a good amount of variety in the missions you do; like the classic Trials style single track courses, to multi-track courses, there are even jetpack courses where instead of riding something, you fly a jetpack! The missions are challenging enough to not be too hard/easy, and there's always the bonus objectives if you want more. All in all, it's a really solid game that I believe stands out among the crowd of all the other runner games.Worth checking out?: YesLikeliness of being bundled: LowPrice you should pay?: ~$3			",1216,285,54,126,121,12,160

												One of the most exaggerated indiegames! It's so much fun, if you're not just trying to finish the level. You should try f*cking around as much as possible, so that you gain incredible high scores and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off at each run.You should NEVER play it without an Xbox360 controller, because you have to press so many things at a time!For example:You'Re approaching a ramp. Hold 'RT' all the time to speed up! There're lvls where you'Re better off affixing this button so that you accelerate constantly.Boost your ""speed-bar"" empty by holding 'A' before you reach the ramp. Now tab 'X' right before you leap to jump even higher. Now hold 'left' or 'right' all the time to back-/frontflip like 7 times or even more.While doing that, smash 'LB'/'RB' like hell to refill your speed-bar with stunt-combos and score!Still in the air (and still holding 'RT' and 'left'/'right' and smashing 'RB'/'LB'), press A again to use the refilled speed-bar and to boost and flip even faster.Touch down safely and repeat on the next ramp. Be creative: every RB/LB combination is a different stunt.  Squeeze the sh*t out of your gamepad.I absolutely love this game!Sometimes you're so heavily overwhelmed by the hyperactivity that you completely freak out and almost break your chair. So much things happen at the same time, it feels like the screen is brutally slapping your face!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The screen is often too cluttered with explosions and various other moving parts, making it easy to lose track of your stuntman. Check out the original game first. It's the better of the two.

If you like repetitive gameplay, this is for you. The various reskins, lack of variety, and tedious gameplay (which is quite easy) will please you. Again, if you like dull gameplay, I can't recommend this enough.EDIT: It does get harder, but it still lacks some variety. It just feels very basic. The presentation is also terrible. If it were a game where gameplay were the focus I can see this being a worthy title, as it is a good sidescrolling runner, but its presentation is disgusting.			",176,33,0,24,22,4,22

												Mac users should skip this unforunately unless you have a genuine Xbox controller and even then I am not sure if it works or not. It did not work with a Logitech F-510 Rumblepad which can be setup either as analog or Xinput so who knows. I do know this, there is no option to remap the buttons so there was no way to attempt setting it up. Controller setup is non-existent in this game. The launcher lets you set keyboard options and does not acknowlege controllers at all. This is pretty strange since who would want to play this with a keyboard? I guess maybe a few people but not the majority I wouldn't think. Checking ingame options just shows the controls on an Xbox controller which should have worked on the Rumblepad (normally I have no issues) but did not. It responded to some but no acceleration is a little tough to deal with in a racer. Anyway, I don't want to knock the game itself as I was not able to play it but just wanted to warn Mac users to be wary. If you do have a genuine Xbox controller you might want to verify in the forums that it works on Mac for somebody else before spending anything on this title. Easy come, easy go here since I got it in a Humble Bundle. Good thing!			",384,104,11,100,32,2,80

												The support of the gamepad is buggy on linux.It starts well but after one ride and the first return to the menu, it's like the gamepad is going completely insanely crazy.It's a USB xbox 360 gamepad that always works. And it works without a problem on shank and shank 2 using steam for linux. So I'm sure it does not come from my system or the steam client.This game has no interest at all played with the keyboard.If the devs fix that I would totally change my review for a positive one.The game is actually fun and performs well on linux. The gamepad bug is killing it.( I tried using both xpad and xboxdrv )For windows users, no problem at all the gamepad works flawlessly.Besides it's a quite funny game trying to get that japanese crazyness from arcade games. And they succeeded at it pretty well in my opinion.The graphics are nice and colourful. I am actually sad of that situation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's basically Uniracers, except with unskippable cutscenes that go on far too long (and even contain areas of absolutely no action whatsoever - a lot of them are like watching a highlight reel with a five second fade-out and five second fade-in in between each clip) and way, way, WAY too much activity going on on-screen. It seems to have been meant for larger displays, but even on a 50"" LCD there's so much background activity and random details on the track that figuring out what needs to be jumped, what needs to be collected, and which route to take is a matter of constant trial-and-error.Keyboard controls can't be rebound, but are generally acceptable (arrow keys + WASD, basically).The core of this game (2D speed-running) is fun, and the internal physics/mechanics are good. But the annoying cutscenes and over-active race screens render this inferior to Uniracers - a game which came out twenty years ago. For under $3 or so, there's worse ways to spend your money, but full-price ($15 as of this review) is a hilarious joke - just not a very positive sort of ""hilarious"".			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												There are many ways to convert a game for PC, but unfortunately the creators of this one chose the ""do nothing at all"" one. It might be enjoyable after you've written down what all the console buttons in the game correspond to on your keybord and learn it by heart... but I'm probably not going to bother.

It's like a 'tarded, more colourful, gay brother of excite bikeYou CANNOT skip cutscenes, and the footage in them isn't even from your gameplay, it's just a collage of pre-recorded scenes that the devs played.The difficulty rises up so fast, and you are given such a short learning curve that you are just going to a)rage quit b)leave it in the background for the trading cards and after that delete it and forget about it forever. I did point b.I understand that this is an xbox port and it should be played with a gamepad, but the devs were so lazy that they did not made a controller page for the keyboard, so you're going to have a hard time nailing the controls if you're playing with a keyboard.They exagerrated a bit with the set animations and blings and whatnot, I mean, there's so much♥♥♥♥♥♥going on around you on the screen that it gets completely distracting at times.What about the checkpoints? There are a few levels that have checkpoints, but most of them you have to complete in one run, and this can surely get pretty annoying after a while, make one wrong move and *poof* back at the starting line with you.It's fun at the beginning, but suddenly becomes this repetitive, clunky, tedious game that has an annoying redneck-ish narrator voice yelling just to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off more.

												This is a great game which is really overlooked by people.A fun art style mixed with an enjoyable soundtrack makes the game appealing to newcomers, however, the real value of it remains for the completionnists! You can quite easly cruize through the levels but if you want to get all the stars in each level and earn all the 30 Pro Medals which unlock new costumes, you're in for a ride!All in all what is really enjoyable is the sense of skill this game gives you, if you die it's all on you, everything is well thought and levels are well construted. After spending 15 hours to complete the game at 100% I can tell you that when you end it you'll be at a whole new level than when you started it.			",360,143,7,39,27,5,50

												I like the music and the graphics are colorful and fit in perfectly with the music. So why the thumbs down? Gameplay and being stuck=no fun. The game needs to be a bit easier to play. Its frusterating to play a game and to be locked out of levels because of not grabbing enough stars. Grrrrr. The game is not as tough as the first one for sure. However I still think if the game play was lowered a little bit more the game would shine a lot more.I can also point to examples of this already happening. Nintendo made a killing by lowering the difficulty in there games and then after completing the main game you would have a newgame+ that would be a lot harder and for experts only. Something Joe Dirt 3 should look at. Great graphics to be sure but hard as nails in the later levels make it less then fun. I would give it a 5/10			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

Tight controls and well laid out levels keeps a good balance between challenge and hijinks.  While the cartoony art style makes even the worse crashes more comical than gruesome.

												This game is nowhere near as fun as it should be. It has lots of potential, but annoying issues made it no fun for me.Graphics and sound are good. Controls are okay, but poorly explained. There appear to be hint screens displayed at the end of races, but they stay on the screen for 2 or 3 seconds and are replaced with something else before I can read them (they disappear even though no button is being pressed).There is a help option listed in the poorly designed menu, but it literally provides no help at all.I don't think many people are playing or enjoying this game much. I only made it through the first three or four levels. On the last level I got stuck on I couldn't make the target time and yet my time was faster than 65% of players.I'm surprised this is the sequel to a game, these issues should have been corrected long ago.

												Good game if you like trial and error gameplay, I don't really like doing the same thing over and over but if you do this game is for you. The graphics are great and the music is well done. This game doesn't have online multiplayer which is a real shame. I didn't have any technical problems with the game and I played it with a Xbox 360 controller without any problems, why anyone would want to play this with a keyboard and then complain about it makes no sense but whatever. I won't be spending much time with this but it's not because there's anything wrong with the game, it's just not for everyone.			",1599,519,67,166,127,16,152

												Actually not a bad game, it works well with the Xbox controller, 7/10. Although the controls seem a bit strange at the beginning, and you will die a lot, it is still one of those games where you actually get better with training and then master each track. Each track has bonus onjectives which earn you start which you need to unlock later stages. There is a huge variety of tracks to complete, make your own tracks, download tracks from the community... and achievements to keep you get going... is not an easy game though, and difficult to 100% (which I did not).

												I felt like this game was a waste of time.  The controls feel clunky.  The hints they give disapear so fast that you will be alittle confused about the controls at first.  I feel like this is a game u play on your phone.  I just felt like i could have spent my time on other more enjoyable games then this one.			",420,115,15,44,25,3,45

												The game was quite fun... for like 5 minutes. It is pretty annoying to start all over and over again because of missing one keystroke. The game is full of colours, animation, effects and sounds, and that makes it confusing and overcrowded with effects. I got it in a humble bundle, wouldn't have bought it for myself.

												Before getting this game i read some reviews and i was thinking this game would be a blast, this is the type of game that i love to play on my iPhone, but unfortunately i din't get too much. the first two Act was fun but after that keep getting very repetitive. Two things i liked was the levels design and the OST. Also if you planing playing this on PC, for the love of god, buy some controller first, you won't be able to play this game right with keyboard and mouse. Not a top priority to recommend to anyone. ~ 5/10			",491,180,16,44,79,10,49

												So I wrote a review yesterday complaining about the fact that this game commited one of the worst sins of ports...having on-screen instructions in controler buttons instead of what your system is actually using. Today, they patched it, and above the controler button, they have the actual keyboard button as well! Fantastic job guys! It's a fun game, somewhat challenging to get everything on a given level, but definately enjoyable!			",242,66,3,31,21,3,32

												I received this game as one of the games apart of the Humble Indie Bundle X.  My first reaction to this game was very frustrating as the controls for mouse and keyboard are very poor and the port from XBOX does not change the button layout.  I have since started playing with a wired XBOX 360 controller and am enjoying the experience now that the trackpad matches the directions.The game plays like a light hearted race, stunt, and collecting random tasks; probably best described as a light hearted and more arcade version of Trials.  I am personally enjoying it as it is easy to play and doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.  At times it is a bit too easy by being able to spam trick buttons with essentially no penalty, but the maps do get progressively more difficult as you have to string time, tricks, collecting, and finding hiden items all in the same space.I do not suggest purchasing this without a gamepad and I also wouldn't recommend a purchase on this for over $2-3 as the port to the PC certainly hurts the experience.  I do recommend playing this game if you enjoy any other Hello Games or want something less intimidating than Trials HD.			",175,43,2,16,12,1,12

Just 3$ more for both instead of only one.I got disapointed by Trials Gold Edition, but this one satisfied my need.No crapp DRM either, very simple to install and launch.Full XInput gamepad support, but keyboard control are very intuitive and are damm fine.

												This game is so wrong:- it breaks alt-tab- it grabs the mouse pointer (so combined with no alt-tab means you’re stuck in the game and can’t even position its window correctly on your screen)- if you remap the keyboard controls, the game still tells you to press the default keys and not the ones you’ve configured, so good luck to understand what to do- the main menu is not a text menu but some 3D scene where you have to guess where you’re supposed to click… again good luck because it’s not obvious at all- the first level I’ve managed to launch starts with an obstacle that is seemingly impossible to pass, and the game gives absolutely zero hint on how to proceed.So yeah, don’t buy this.

												I enjoyed the first Joe Danger quite a bit but this one is not up to par. The theme and the graphics are nice and fit really well with the game. The gameplay is fast and fluid. There is a lot going on screen and it really looks like you are filming a movie. But the level design is where this game fails. The levels just get repetitive and you encounter the same problems throughout the game. The game quickly gets to the point where you have to memorize when you have to duck and when to jump. To avoid the same three hazards (bombs, spikes, and instances where you have to duck). The later levels just reuse some parts of the earlier levels. It just gets frustrating. If you are a fan of Joe Danger maybe get this, otherwise look for something else.			",236,25,12,25,25,1,60

												The game itself is kinda like BIT.TRIP RUNNER. You progress to the right until you reach the end goal, do some jumps/ducks/boosts to manuever yourself around obstacles, and find collectables along the way. There is no real story, just more like a theme to tie the game together. At first the controls can seem overwhelming, but you can get used to it in time. Xbox controller is almost mandatory- keyboard may be usable but it's obvious that they desgined it for controller. Pretty good replay value when you have steam friends that play because their ghosts will show up during the game (so you can compare how good/bad you're doing to their run). People who like to score attack and get high scores will probably enjoy this, and one-button restart helps. People who aren't that into the genre will find it hard to keep up (no real tutorial and game throws different things at you quickly without explanation) and will probably be better off playing a simpler one instead before moving on to this.I find it annoying that it secretly installed xvid separately and it doesn't ask to remove/remove it when uninstalled, so I can't recommend it.

												After launch the game for the first time, I find myself very exiting about the game that I hear very well review.And after that is just disappointment...I didn't play the first one and there is no real tutorial for the game. Only some messages that you don't have time to read at first.After you manage to control the game you find that he is very repetitive and not that funny. I know it's arcade game but for the price I didn’t get what I expected...I still think this game could be perfect for small session but it would be far better on mobile at lower price.So, to conclude, I can understand that people like this game but I will not be surprised that lot of people don't particularly like it.

												This game is so wrong:- it breaks alt-tab- it grabs the mouse pointer (so combined with no alt-tab means you’re stuck in the game and can’t even position its window correctly on your screen)- if you remap the keyboard controls, the game still tells you to press the default keys and not the ones you’ve configured, so good luck to understand what to do- the main menu is not a text menu but some 3D scene where you have to guess where you’re supposed to click… again good luck because it’s not obvious at all- the first level I’ve managed to launch starts with an obstacle that is seemingly impossible to pass, and the game gives absolutely zero hint on how to proceed.So yeah, don’t buy this.

												My 5 years old son's favourite game!We bought ""Joe Danger"" for the PS3, we bought ""Joe Danger Special Edition"" for the XBOX 3360 and ""Joe Danger 2 -The movie"" immediately after release... and then the DLC.The PC version is like the XBOX 360 one except for some additional characters and the fact that you need to do this: http://steamcommunity.com/app/242110/discussions/0/864971660905104130/#p1to be able to use more than one controller.I was hoping you could import more than 5 custom levels in the PC version, but this part is like the XBOX version too.

												This game is a good idea, poorly implemented, which mean only completionist players will find some enjoyment out of it. There is at least 3 big flaws that undo it.The first problem are the controls. They are so many buttons to use (on a Xbox360 controller :  up, down, left, right, A, B, X, LT, LB, RT, RB are all used while ingame !) that your brain will melt under the load when you try to go for highscores and complicated stars challenges.The second problem is that theses controls are poorly explained. They give you informations about the controls only one by one, while playing a level. Try reading a speech bubble when you're turboing. That would probably lead to something like : ""Ppppppppppppppprrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssssss Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx toooooooooooooo juuuuuuuuuuuu..."" There is no proper tutorial level to learn all controls at the same time in an unstresseful environment. Worse, what they call advanced tricks is only explained in later levels, even though they aren't that complicated, and would be extremely useful right from the beginning. For example, the Double X = double Jump is only explained half way through, even though it's mandatory for a star in level 2 or 3.Finally, after all this if you've kept to the game, you will understand the third, and final thing that completely undo this game : it lacks clear objectives. In each level, you can go for challenge stars, time attack, or score attack, but there is not really a goal to reach. Finishing a level is very easy, so only theses optional objectives make sense.However, theses 3 objectives clash with one another : - going for time usually means just rushing the level without getting the collectibles or doing figures (which is the main part of the scoring)- going for score usually means going as slow as you can get away with, and do lot of figures on the same place, which obviously will give you an atrocious time. Since there is no time penalty, it's still the ""best"" way to do it, even though it's slow and boring.- finally going for stars usually impact negatively both time and score. To sum it up, you can try all of theses, but it will feel more like grinding than overcoming challenges.So for me, the game feel rather shallow, you set your own meaningless achievements, and go through similar level after similar levels, which does sometimes provide fun but usually is just a boring grind. That also seems like a common opinion because if you check either the online leaderboards or the achievements stats, you will see that most people gave up early on this game, and no one cares enough about the game to try to achieves records (it's very easy to enter the top 100 or even the top 10 in some later levels).I've spent quite some time in the game because I'm a completionist, and i do think that completionists will try at least get all the stars (but probably not compete for leaderboards). That group of players are probably the ones most likely to enjoy the game. So, in the end, even if Joe Danger 2 is not a bad game and has some moments of brillance, it's just not good enough for me to recommend itPS : Though I haven't tried multiplayer yet (because it's local only), i don't think it would work either. Multiplayer games are fun when everyone can enjoy the game, regardless of skill and end result, and it's even better if there is a way to handicap good players or boost newbie players (think bonus in Mario Kart)Unfortunately in Joe Danger you can get eliminated by being thrown out of the screen, and the winner is the one getting the most points. So it's fairly obvious that the difference in skill among players will be too much of a problem. A good player will just eradicate all opposition before the end of the race, while scoring more than the others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
