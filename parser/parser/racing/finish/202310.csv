												Ridge Racer Unbounded is completely unrelated to the original Ridge Racer arcade games. It managed to introduce a lot of new concepts, such as course construction set (with progressive unlock of building blocks), group racing, lots of cars, multiple modes, destructible scenes, and so on. However, with the shut down of the matchmaking servers in early 2015, buggy game (crash to desktop after several races), and odd handling (there is no tutorial on how drift works in this game) means the game, even at bargain basement prices, is not exactly a good investment. As a new racer joining the scene in Shatter Bay, your task is to ""take over"" multiple neighborhoods by doing well or very well in the various races. Each neighborhood has about 7 races. Winning the races (or at least, get into top 3) will unlock higher races, while accumulating score will increase your rank and gain you access to better cars. There are multiple race modes, but most races will be ""domination race"", where you race up to 11 other cars. Do the special moves like getting air, hit top speed, or drifting, will gain you boost. Once you fill the boost gauge, you can engage boost which allows you to smash through certain ""targets"", yielding shortcuts that gain you more boost (usually involve getting some big air) but since boost has limited duration, you have to time its use carefully. Smashing other cars will cause them to respawn, albeit several seconds behind. So what's the problem? Very weird drifting mechanism. Some guides advocate holding down the handbrake button during the turn, others insist on releasing the handbrake as soon as drift had started. The problem is there is no ""test track"" for you to practice. It's always race, race, race. The graphics are quite good, and as this is a Bugbear product (makers of Flatout series) the game has decent handling... except for the weird drifting. Sound is... okay, with a lot of decent soundtracks, again, just like Bugbear games like Flatout. You were able to build your own race courses and as you conquer neighborhoods and raise your driver level you will unlock additional blocks to build the courses. However, with death of the matchmaking servers the courses are of little use now, as much of the fun is race others in MP games. In fact, the game is stuck for about a minute checking for nonexisting server when it starts up. All in all, Ridge Racer Unbounded tried to do too much and lack of tutorial / test track made the game unenjoyable, and the shutdown of matchmaking server is the nail in the coffin. It's fast, it's furious, but it left an empty feeling.			",504,122,48,53,72,1,101

												When I purchased this game, I expected a Ridge Racer experience: alien vehicles drifting at impossible angles and blinding speed in every curve with a very passionate commentator. Ridge Racer™ Unbounded is none of those things.This game differs from the rest of the series. A lot. You can actually drift off into wall and crash your car, or bump into your opponents in an attempt to take them out. There's a handful of game types you can play, from your typical race to the finish where drifting fills up your boost meter (Shindo racing), to causing as much damage to the city as you pass through it, including your opponents (Domination race).Each car has a unique feel to it, although most of them just slide all over the place, or can barely turn at all. The lower the ""Drift"", and the higher the ""Handling"", the easier to drive!The graphics are simply beautiful. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the different shops in the city to the spot-on reflections on the cars. The weather changes the look and feel of the track in an immersive way, although there is no precipitation. My only complaint is that lighting effects are sometimes blindingly intense, especially at night, to the point where wearing sunglasses would almost make sense.The music is upbeat and powerful, unfortunately we do not get a set of original tracks this time around. Ridge Racer™ Unbounded borrows a few tracks from previous games in the series, as well as songs from other artists.The game features a fairly simple track editor, which reminds me of Accolade's Grand Prix Unlimited (DOS). Published tracks are uploaded online, where everyone has access to them. That's an infinity of maps to play on! I must admit, however, that most people are very uncreative when it comes to making custom tracks, but there's always a few gems in there. You just gotta find them!Unfortunately, I can't say much about the multiplayer experience. You can invite people from your Steam friends to play with you, but don't expect anyone else to join your game.I've encountered a few bugs here and there (glitching graphics, flipping cameras when boosting during a collision, and one area where you can drive off the map), but nothing major or game breaking.What I'd love to see in this game would be a better controller support (for non-Xbox 360 controllers), rural-themed tracks, and maybe a multiplayer lobby where all players can actually see who's online and play together!Overall, Ridge Racer™ Unbounded's title can be misleading, but it's still tons of fun, and has a high replayability value for a modest price. I recommend it to anyone who'd love a neat little pick-up-and-play urban-racing game.			",10,1,2,4,1,0,0

												Its not a ridge racer game. Its burnout meets trackmania without a clear focus. The game is based around beautiful destruction physics but in order to destroy other cars, you need to drift, chase, or destroy items. Destroying items is worthless since you get a fraction of the boost needed, so you tend to be drifting a lot.However the ai just gains boost at a steady pace, meaning they will just boost whenever their meter is full. The boost itself is odd, its designed around strategic use to either power through a corner, destroy a city target to get more speed/shortcuts, or take out a racer but instead the game requires you to be constantly boosting in order to keep up. As well, there are no mechanics to allow players to catch up. None of the short cuts drastically change the map and the leader can use his boost to open it up anyways so there is no way for someone behind him to catch up unless he messes up.Given the nature boost is gained, the late game is also to the favor of the leader as there are less targets available and players are more spread out. Combat is also weird. There are no rewards for damaging cars, and you don't get boost if you frag someone in a special way ala burnout. Also unlike later burnout entries, there is only one type of car per race. As a result, cars with good acceleration and speed trump all else since they can drift fine and use boost to make up for any lose of speed.The game does have one very interesting part and thats the special events. These include some trackmania esque maps where you have to get to the finish line while hitting targets. But what sells the game to me is the sense of destruction. The objects you destroy remain on the track making the track feel more and more wartorn and whenever you destroy a car you see an amazing slow motion view of it bouncing. It never got old for me.As for the default levels, they are pretty generic and some end up being confusing since they reuse prefabs in an unusual way. The events aren't always balanced, either, some will prove to be a pain since you just don't have the right car for it or others are so easy because you can use a car that the level wasn't balanced for.The star is the player-made levels, of which there are tons, which use the ingame editor and allow for a nice variety of fun and bizarre levels. The game to me seems like a case where there was a pre-existing game that was adapted with the ridge racer brand and then rushed into development.I say get the game if you like arcade destruction racing , the 10 dollar price tag is appropiate but with games like carmageddon and NCG, there are more focused alternatives.

												I just picked this up on sale and I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the reviews that said this game was bad and gave it a thumbs down. I am having an absolute blast playing it ! It's a lot of fun and quite challenging if you try to get all the stars for each track. There are over 60 races to complete and you can create your own tracks as well. The Multi-player  is shut down so don't buy it for online play. I have played many Ridge Racer games in the past and I loved R4 back in the day. Some may complain that this doesn't feel like a Ridge Racer game and they would be somewhat right. It's Ridge Racer to the extreme. The Ridge Racer game series needed to evolve with new gameplay and this game does that. It still has the Ridge Racer ""vibe"" with all the powersliding you can handle while listening to techno style music. But, it adds in destructible environments with alternate routes you open up by smashing through walls and buildings on each course. It also has opponent take downs like we have seen in games like burnout. All of this destruction adds to your power/turbo meter. You can keep the meter filled up by causing destruction to the other racers and the environment. Keeping your meter maxed as often as possible is essential to winning races because the AI is not easy to beat. They drive well, boost often and will even ""frag"" you when you are ahead of them.  Even if you don't come in first you still get points so losing the race is not always a bad thing.In additon to the main ""domination"" mode there are several other game modes to mix things up. There is a mode called ""Shindo"" that is a lot like recent RR games where you just get boost for powersliding and the envronment is less destructible. There's also drift attack, time attack and a ""frag"" mode where you try to destroy as many oponents as possible. All are fun in there own way and you can apply these modes to the tracks you create as well. My biggest complaint with Ridge Racer unbounded is that there needs to be more options to change the graphics and control settings for the game. They are extremly limited and it's obvious this is a console port. The game still looks good but more settings for the PC version would have been appreciated. Other than that it's a solid arcade racer.Overall, the game is just plain fun and that's what counts to me. I don't understand why people don't like it. Maybe they are struggling to win the races. Some races are very difficult and require multiple attempts to win. As with other racing games it takes some practice to get use to the handling of the cars. Also, there is a  button for drifting and you should use it instead of the brakes to start your drift.Maybe the people who don't like it expect it to be like the older Ridge Racer games but I'm actually glad it's different than the previous games. Why make a new Ridge Racer game if it's doesn't add anything different ? Also, I don't care that the MP is dead. I don't play MP on many games anyway. So if your looking for a fun, challenging, over the top, arcade  racing experience give this game a try. 8 out of 10			",324,126,18,59,26,3,85

												I have never played Burnout, a lot of others seem to say this is similar....Honestly I do enjoy this game, the music is pacey, the gameplay is easy to grasp. It is slightly repetitive but worth a few pounds. It is a bit like Paradise City in a way due to its destruction stages, but without an open world (boo...).I have stopped playing because the drifting stages are god-awful or I am just very bad at them.I did buy the dlc at them time as it was mega a cheap, cars arnt great, but the RR Type 4 pack brings back some great times with the RT Solvalu. But, it no doubt comes as no surprise to hear that it sucks in game.			",141,5,7,7,3,1,8

												Can't really recommend this one. Although drifting through a corner certainly gives you an amount of satisfaction, frustration with other elements are plentiful. Results in the race seem heavily dependent on luck, or moreso the absence of bad luck, wich you will have most of the races. The handling feels very mediocre and unpolished.The scenery or city you race in seems a bit lifeless. The AI is tough as hell, but not in a good way. If you're looking for an arcade racer, i can happily recommend NFS: Hot Pursuit, Blur, Burn-out, Driver: SF or even a Sonic Racer. This one falls short of the quality one would expect from a game in this day and age. I say C-			",186,12,19,6,7,0,10

												I just couldn't stand it anymore.That's my short-review of Unbounded. Is a long-review really necessary? *Sigh*Well if nothing can be done about it, let's dive in.I've been a Ridge Racer fan for quite a long time. Aside from Ridge Racer Vita, R: Racing Evolution, and maybe Rave Racer, I've played all the games. I'm extensively familiar with the series, but that's irrelevant. Unbounded is...I don't know what it is. Was it some game Namco bought and then had some RR music and cars included to tie everything together? I don't know. So yeah, if I compare this game to RR, or hell if I so much has even mention that game, then I've lost. Unbounded takes place in Shatter Bay, where a mysterious group is involved in illegal street racing. Apparently they hate the city almost as much as they hate each other. This is one of those racing games where not only can you obliterate your rivals, but you can also bust through cafes, government buildings, and construction sites for a shortcut. The similarities to Burnout are pretty obvious, though in this game ""checking"" a rival is a bit more binary.By catching air, drifting, and/or receiving various in-race awards, the player gets boost. Aside from a temporary increase in speed, anyone you run into during that brief period is going to get wrecked. This is about a 95% chance. If you're grinding next to someone (oh my) and you hit the boost, they're going to turn into flaming wreckage instantly. When not boosting you have a 5% chance of wrecking someone. This is a neat way to reverse all the dirty tricks that can happen in  a usual race. Say you're one of two racers making a turn. You're on the outside, and the inside guy is using you as a buffer to avoid hitting the wall. This is a great time to boost because they'll suffer dearly. Also whenever you wreck an opponent, the game auto-corrects your car, so you don't drive into a wall or anything. Exploiting this mechanic can be quite handy. Your opponents can boost as well, and aside from the red trail there's no obvious indication that they've boosted. Something like a sound effect could have been really useful. As it stands you're better off handling the other racers with kid gloves (especially if they're cheating AI), because they could boost at potentially any moment and take you out. Boosting is also necessary for certain destructable objects. Their usefulness in the actual race varies, and they could just as easily glitch out and cause you to flip over or get turned around. To unlock more races you have to amass a lot of points, destroying stuff is how you get them.There are no shortage of tracks in this game. That's because they're all created via a track-editor. It's a neat idea but not really fleshed out. Basically each track is divided into sections. Let's say there is a straight-away, a curve to the right, a squiggly line, a hard-angle right, a dip, a long-easy right, a hairpin right, and that's the track. A lot of time in arcade-racers is spent learning the track itself, but with this game it doesn't seem to matter much at all. Instead you familiarize yourself with particular turns (the 1 or 2 difficult ones to be precise). While the track-editor allows further customization by adding objects and other tools, it's not as deep as it could be. Let's call it a limitation of the game-design. It's difficult to create ornate tracks when it's expected that a handful of racers are trying to destroy each other. There are a lot of created tracks floating around, and some are really interesting. Consider spending some time checking things out online.I don't like the handling. Normally I'd just tack this on to the end of a huge paragraph, but it's the #1 reason why I couldn't take anymore of this game. The main reason I don't like it is because it's inconsistent. With some games drifting has either A) a sizable learning curve, or B) can be picked up in the first few seconds. Both A & B work on their own. Daytona USA** is an A type, while Ridge Racer (I lose!) is a B type. Both games have appropriate learning curves, and mastering them is an exceptional feat despite the wildly different barriers of entry. Unbounded can't be an A type because the tracks aren't nearly as involved and well-designed. There's only so much you can do with such a base-selection of turns. Unbounded isn't a B type either because the cars have more weight, it takes more counter-steering not to lose control, and deciding between what type of brake to use to initiate the drift is more important. Essentially the system just doesn't gel for me, but I guess it doesn't matter.This game apparently considers good drifting somewhere towards the bottom of ""things you should actually be concerned about in a race"". In the career mode there are very few time-attack races, and even then they have gimmicks like icons you pick up to freeze the clock. There are drifting events too, but you don't think about applying what you've picked up in an actual race. It's hard to appreciate a good drift in this game, when it's usually more effective to barrel through the opposition with a boost. Sometimes the winner is merely the racer that managed to get away from the chaos. More often than not, driving skill takes a backseat.Altogether Unbounded just isn't satisfying. It never flicks the ""Hell Yeah!"" switch in my brain. Quad-kills, surviving a brutally difficult platforming section, or just executing the perfect drift through the hardest turn, these are just some of the many ""Hell Yeah!"" moments. Unbounded has never in my 7 hours* of play elicited that same response. I do all these supposedly awesome things but it's just not exciting at all. *Yes I realize that by playing the game for a sizable amount of time, I've opened myself up to comments such as ""If you didn't like the game, why'd you play it for that long?"" I was ready to quit this game after 2 hours, but that wouldn't be fair would it? Although, I probably should have beat the game, but playing Unbounded for 10+ hours is just too much to ask of me.Sorry.**In Daytona USA it's called power-sliding. It's the same but different.

 A lackluster and uninspired game	Here’s the bad news, Unbounded is a mesh of many different concepts, a constant copy paste of various core mechanics from other gamesMy way of reasoning for this one, if the games that where blatantly copied are still better than this product, then there is other things you could be playing right now. GAMEPLAY	 DRIFTINGJust like RR, it's an integral part of the game. The problem here, is that despite being an arcade racer, drifting is somewhat realistic, completely destroying whatever fun you could have with it.The way the steering works, combined with the light height of the car, makes for really floaty driving. It feels off. DESTRUCTIONLots and lots of meaningless destructibles, as you are given what is basically a tank in shape of a car, anything you see in the middle of the road can be destroyed, well almost everything.Sure, I won’t deny its fun, It’s the way its implemented that feels lazy and inconsistentFor example, you win Nitro for hitting walls when drifting, which means you are being rewarded for being bad at it, but then you have random objects and even some destructible walls that don’t give you anything, except for a small amount of points, that only have purpose in Domination races and even then the quantity is so small it won’t even matter.Its unnecessarily confusing BOOSTINGStill present is the boost for drafting, drifting and air time, and now by any form of physical contact with other carsIts then used too ""frag"" other cars or open hidden paths, and it’s a good way to win points as well, which you will need to unlock more races.From all of these, drafting is the worst way to gain boost, AI is significantly slower than you, making it so you only get a small amount before eventually leaving them behindEven though there’s more ways to win boost in this new RR, very rarely is it possible to stack boost after boost, since speed isn’t really encouraged in Unbounded.Boost is played more strategically, its not even related to speed anymore. Doesn’t seem like much but will lead to situations were slow moving cars can frag other vehicles or going at full speed to open an hidden path, only  to have the boost run out on you, leaving you to crash against the wall. EVENTS Domination races is where the game most shines, its were the game mechanics seem to work or even make sense.  Where drifting and Frag Attack are just broken, even to the point of exploitation, unless the point was to drive really slow, in which case I wouldn’t even know what to say MUSIC Classic RR songs that do not fit with the game at all, with Skrillex thrown in.It would feel more authentic with other artists, not sure why the stopped there or even came choose that particular artist, but it’s something, at least DESIGN The track design is quite good and the environments although not busy, are aesthetically pleasing. Few more things you should know if you are pondering on buying this game .if you are an achievement hunter, beware that the MP no longer exists but those achievements have not been removed, and cannot be unlocked in a fair and non-shameful way.There is no video options aside from Anisotropic and i wouldn't recommend touching that unless you want the game to crash after each race  ",1274,458,45,110,117,11,152

												4 hours may not seem like much, but it's an eternity when you're playing this game. I gave this a shot because I have great respect for Bandai Namco, but I was sorely disappointed. Once the novelty of blowing up fellow racers wears off, this game turns into an overhyped Micheal Bay style cluster♥♥♥♥. The drift system is awful, the vehicles are ridiculous, and the ""plot"" is shallow. (and pedantic) I would also be remiss if I failed to mention that the multiplayer servers are no longer up, so if you play this game, you will be forced to experiecne this torment alone.Trust me, whatever the price is for this, dear reader, it is too much. I honestly wish I had my 4 hours back. If you were considering this because you like racers, pick something else. If you were interested in blowing up things while you raced, go play Burnout. It's way more fun and overall better built.			",110,9,1,22,3,1,5

												This is an awesome racing game but the multiplayer is missing since they shut down the servers only 2 years after releasing the game. If you don't mind just running the same tracks all by yourself this is a really cool game. Reminded me of ""Burnout"". It was very enjoyable playing the online part because you could run tracks other players created. It was very challenging. It has been a big let down since they shut down the servers. Everyone needs to complain to Bandi Games until they turn them back on. This is only 1/3 the game without the multiplayer and world domination. I can't believe they still advertise online player when selling this game.			",94,28,13,1,5,0,2

												As with all Ridge Racer titles, the game play is fast paced, arcade-like, explosive fun. Once you master the art of drifting (some cars are much better than others), you can start scoring huge drift scores and unlocking new cars, new races, new districts, and finally city blocks for the track editor (that allows you to make your own race track and share it online for others to race). You can even drive an American Truck and ram the police, and some of the time trials are nuts taking you through loop the loops, and insane angles. Despite all this, I found the game a bit too easy to master.  If you liked Driftopia, you'll probably love this too. Personal Rating: A bit too easy, but nonetheless good solid fun.

												Ridge Racer Type 4 has always been a favorite of mine, if not my favorite game ever. This game, however, does not even deserve the name Ridge Racer in the slightest. It's a cheap, weird clone of Burnout that does everything that makes it's source of ""inspiration"" fun, wrong. It's slow, clunky, drifting is awful and the (crash) physics are just dreadful.The only plus point I can give is that they put the Assoluto Bisonte from past games into the game, but even that is DLC. There's also a couple music tracks from past games, but nothing exciting. Still waiting for a game that comes close to RRT4's greatness, Namco. And when you're at it, get me a new Ace Combat game that doesn't suck.			",81,4,20,9,16,0,4

												This is one of the most underrated games i have ever played. I have been a fan of the Ridge racer series since Rage racer hit the ps1 in 1997, I’ve loved the way cars can drift around corners at impossible angles and speeds...and how its all about the skill of drifting. THIS GAME IS NOT LIKE THE OLD RIDGE RACERS; in this game you can hit walls and it is not very likely you will keep your speed when you just turn and press the drift button, in unbound you have to control your car, or else you will be at the back of the grid. It also borrows from the burnout series with 'frags' (takedowns in burnout)...this adds another element to the exciting racing in this game. It is also made by bugbear (the makers of the flat-out series and Next Car Game), you can see game elements from flat-out throughout this game, as in the highly destructive environments and vehicle combat. The track-editor is also amazing, the editor lets you create many...MANY tracks in all different shapes with all different elements, the advanced editor lets you add ramps and explosives to the track you have created. Overall if you want a fun arcade racer to pass the time and have a lot of fun along the way, get this!! its a brilliant mix of many different racing games.			",164,8,25,9,9,1,31

												Crazy bad♥♥♥♥♥racing,i think i said wtf ten times in a single race,i later realized i was racing a custom track but hey it was still crazy,great graphics,even better music,ultra fast and ultra smooth on 1080p,online functions are there but no one seems to play this game,you can create your own tracks and track sets,you can then post them online for others to play.I find it strange,infact Namco must have found it strange that there is little to no server activity for this game,they also must be scratching their heads and wondering why no one bought this game,i also wonder why Unbounded has not sold anywhere near it's worth,to look at this game and realize how much fun it is and how good the game looks and runs as well as the fact that Namco were bold enough to include a full track editor instead of trying to sell out on track and car dlc.I just do not get why no one owns or plays it,reviews may say it's not a true ridge racer but i would say it does have the same feel and racing machanics of ridge racer,also the same scenic design of ridge racer,but hell yeh it is different and better in my opinion.This game is pretty dam cheap by any standards and it can be picked up on deal often and right now it costs only £3.45 here ..http://www.nuuvem.com.br/produto/627-ridge-racer-unboundedThis game is like burnout meets ridgeracer,cross breeded with flatout and trackmania on coke,i recommend this game to everyone who likes a good arcade racer,very casual but also deep enough to keep you racing and the amount of tracks will keep online racing fresh.IGN review link - sums up the game pretty well but the game looks crappy in the ign video (console port) maybe,framerate was bad as well as looking washed out but the pc game looks dark,lush and full 60fps.

												Ridge Racer: Unbounded was, to me, a very fun, yet repetitive racing experience.(Be prepared to read a VERY descriptive review. TL;DR is at the bottom.)The game's introduction is very simple, and explains to the player how Shatter Bay came to be, only to turn into a urban playground for the Unbounded. As a beginner, the player is convinced by the hashiriya master to join the Unbounded, and seeks higher recognition by moving up the ranks.Now, if you've played any of the Ridge Racer titles preceding this one, you'll find that this particular title mostly leaves any traditional aspect of the older games in the dust. However, do note that Unbounded was produced alongside major game developer Bugbear Entertainment, the same folks behind the Flatout series and, most recently, Next Car Game: Wreckfest. Bugbear's role in developing Unbounded was one of the major factors in producing this game.The single-player mode is very simple. The player has to race through the districts within Shatter Bay and dominate every one of them. These districts very in location and theme, from the lower parts to the docks to even the city center. Now, each district has a set of challenges that get tougher and tougher as the player moves from district to district. These events are filtered out into specific types, from the standard Domination Race to my personal favorite, Drift Attack. Unbounded also adds a ranking system to game, where you unlock more & more features by gaining EXP and moving yourself up higher on the list. Now, from my playthrough of Unbounded, I found that these challenges often felt a little repetitive, considering that they all take place within their respective districts and can only offer so much in terms of visuals.Gameplay is where Bugbear's changes come into light. The physics system is completely different compared to traditional Ridge Racer titles, with drifting through corners feeling more realistic instead of the old-fashioned ""go through a turn drifting at 300 km/h"" approach. However, from my playthough experience, the physics of Unbounded are easy to adjust to, with a slight learning curve. There's new gameplay mechanics implemented into Unbounded, the most notable being Frags and Targets. Frags are the Unbounded equivalent of Burnout's Takedowns, where you can smash into another opponent in order to temporarily render them out of play. An awards system is also present, which gives awards to objectives you achieve as you're racing, such as hitting a particular Target or getting multiple Frags. Targets, however, pretty much lead me to my next point.The game now introduces a destructive environment, where almost everything can be smashed into. DICE ain't got anything on the amount of buildings and coffee shops you'll be smashing through, as the amount of destruction the player will be causing to the city can put a smile on his/her face. And yes, there's explosions too.Small explosions.Big explosions.Michael Bay-approved explosions.Aside from the carnage, there's a game mode that I'd like to recall: Shindo racing. This is pretty much the standard racing game mode, where there's no frags and no driving into buildings. Instead, you race against other Shindo class opponents around the city, with the winner being the first across the line. The game also features Time Attack, where you race against the clock in order to beat the timer.One of the game's bigger selling points is the track editor. This allows users to build up their own personal cities for other players to violently smash through. Track pieces are unlocked as the player progresses through the single-player and multi-player. However, I found that making a city isn't exactly the best time-investing thing to do, but the option will be there should I choose to do so.This game often goes on sale, and when it does, it's very cheap. I picked up Unbounded with all the DLCs for less than $4 during the Steam Winter Sale of 2014. The game made up the $3.74 I paid for it quite well, providing a solid single-player experience with the added addition of multiplayer (which, admittedly, I haven't gotten to yet).TL;DR: Ridge Racer Unbounded is a game that I'd recommend as a means of trying new things. The revamped gameplay plus the added ability to create your own personal city to tear through offers a very entertaining experience for the racer fanatic. The single-player is a pretty decent experience, but it allows you to understand how the game works, so that you can begin dominating other players online. ",51,5,11,1,2,0,2

												Things that I like:Super fun, speed effect, arcade style racing. Now with better multiplayer, and customizable tracks!!! The cars are pretty, and crashing through stuff is fun, I actually like the unrealistic physics, and cars. When I first got this game, I was all like: 'Oh finally, here's where flatout3 went.'  I was quite happy, and really got into it. Great fun, fast racing, and all the fanciness that you would expect from Bugbear. I congratulate you for showing up the losers that ruined the title you should have done.Things that I didn't like:The learning curve is fun, you pick up on the game and gain skill as you play. BUT there's a point where it turns into a learning abyss, and there you are at the end of the game, with no chance of finishing it. I'm really salty about this, but there's a solution (not to discourage you from buying it) ONLINE. If you want to race h2h, arcade style; this game is perfect and what you're looking for.

												It's criminal that this game has so many negative reviews so I guess I'll throw my opinion in the mix. This is a unique, skillful, strategic racing game with quite a bit of challenging single player content.Just about all of the negative reviews don't seem to get it. The game is hard. It's not instant satisfaction win-first-try run of the mill garbage. You have to play races multiple times, build a route and create a plan on how to win: manipulating the AI so you stay out of their way when you need to, and exploit them when you can. On some tracks I would even start over multiple times just to get a solid start on the first corner of a lap.If I had to knock it for anything, it's that the car balance isn't the best. It's not bad, but sometimes you will unlock a car later that makes previous tracks easier. So, it can be frustrating (but also fun) to try to beat a track over and over only to have it get retroactively easier due to an unlock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, it's not really Ridge Racer. I mean, there's drifting.. and there's a heavy arcade feel to it. That's it.I'll keep things short. Unbounded is not bad, not bad AT ALL. Graphics are fine, sense of speed is ok. Handling is something you need to get use to, but nothing awful. Yes, track design lacks a real punch and the difficulty can be frustrating. But in the other hand - Unbounded is a fun game, being a weird, twisted child of Ridge Racer and Burnout/Flatout. If you find it on sale, for about 3-5€, it's defnitly worth it! Yes, there's plenty other, better racing games.But i still find Unbounded charming and... it puts me in a special mood. This game killed Ridge Racer franchise. Not because it's bad - developers just didn't know what to do with it. Innovate or stay the same? It's all sad, i remember playing Ridge Racer on original Playstation. Oh well. Try Unbounded. It has a demo, so why not ?			",369,59,13,36,35,4,57

												Do you like Burnout? Enjoy the destruction of Split Second? Then this game is for you!If your expecting classic Ridge Racer then look else where.This game should have been its own franchise but it`s not, it has the Ridge Racer title, RR style cars and music but that is where similarities end. Do I care? Hell no! This game puts Michael Bay to shame with its crashes and destruction. I loved it on PS3, and I love it on PC.The sad truth though is that there is no online, the servers were shut down some time ago and Namco opted not to modify the game to allow peer to peer connection, or even stop the game attempting to connect to none existent servers on launch. But this does not stop the game being fun, so if you see it in the sale buy it and have a smashing time!One last thing to note, for achievement collectors sadly you will not get all achievements for this game as there are a couple that are awarded for online play, no online play = missing achievements :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is frustrating as hellIt's somewhat fun, but frustrating to the highest degree. IMO, needs a difficulty slider to make things more even and grounded. The rate at which your car gets 'fragged' becomes way too often apart from the AI cars, which are tanks compared to your car. It seemingly gives you no chance against other cars, and the speed system is rubber banded, so to speak,so it doesn't matter what car you have, the AI will always catch up, no matter how perfect you drive.This particular game brings shame to the genre of arcade racing. I usually find them fun, and can play just about anything. Except this...the only thing I can use to describe it is abhorrent.The game suffers, and I give it a 5/10, and I cannot personally recommend it to anyone. Not even at a $1 price point.

												DO NOT BUY THIS. This do not look like Ridge racer at all ! And there is no choice between cars ! Oh yeah you have to pay DLC for that ! This is more like a Burnout or something like that but in less good. The mechanics of the game espaces me , really, you destroy other cars just by using a Boost ?????!!! DAFUK ?!   You can destroy a Statue and buildings by using your Boost ???!!!Their boost looks more like an NAVY weapon than something else. You can hardly go speeder than 220KM/H.I just play this because this is the single Race game i have, and i had it for free with DLCs. IF YOU READ THIS MESSAGE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! TRUST ME !

												Apparently the online servers don't work anymore because they've been shut down. Unfortunately, the multiplayer would probably be the only reason to keep playing this game.As far as gameplay goes, this game is unlike any proper Ridge Racer game before it. Unbounded is trying to be something akin to a (pre-Paradise) Burnout but it falls short of being better than any Burnout game. The drifting mechanics aren't great and the cars you start with all feel heavy, clunky and slow (even the DLC cars). You don't get the drifting you come to expect from a RR and you don't get the speed you would expect from a Burnout.RR Unbounded is a game with an identity crisis and as a result it doesn't execute well in anything. I only got this game and some DLC for it as part of a Humble Bundle. With all the issues the game has on top of it's current multiplayer-less state, there is no way I can seriously recommend anybody spend any amount of money for this game.			",226,47,5,12,13,2,26

												It's hard to say anything positive about this one. Why Namco decided they needed to farm off the classic Ridge Racer licence to a western studio and make a game completely devoid of anything that made the series great in the first place is beyond me. On top of that, the single player game is needlessly difficult and tedious to try and get through.The original arcade and playstation series of Ridge Racer were epic, incredible arcade games which still hold up today. Lets hope Namco come to their senses in the future and give us a proper Ridge Racer worthy of the name. Even a remaster of one of the original games would do. Steam is desperately lacking in classic arcade racers and anyone who is fond of the franchise and picks this up is likely to be dissapointed, even if it's dirt cheap.			",390,25,14,15,18,3,15

												Excellent arcadey racer right here!The game is focused on five (give or take) different modes, with domination being the main one. You collect points on each race to unlock more races, coming first sometimes doesn’t' guarantee unlocking later races (especially in the later game) so the game forces you to race aggressively which in my opinion makes the game really fun. Also the mechanics of the boost are really well made and add a layer of strategy.The game also has a track maker with a lot of additional player made content already available that you can enjoy once the main cities are finished.Overall I really don't understand how come this game isn't more popular, I got this on sale after I played the demo and I can easily say it's well worth the full price!

												For reference, I probably played at least 30-35 hours of this game on the PS3. I bought it on PC because it is simply more convenient, and I'll get to play it more frequently. But I've also done some fairly extensive testing of the PC version before posting this review. It could do with more graphics options, but it's an alright port and runs pretty well.Now, getting to the point: I simply could not believe how good this game was, given the harsh backlash. This game sold very poorly, and as such, went under the radar for most. It was hated by Ridge Racer fans, because in truth, it strays VERY far from the formula in other Ridge Racer games. It also takes a decent amount of skill and practice. As such, the reviews for this game were completely off. Even in reviews that praised the game (e.g. Eurogamer) it is obvious that the reviewers really struggled, especially with the concept of a drift button, which is pretty ridiculous.It draws far more inspiration from games like the PS2 Burnout games and the Flatout games. In fact, it was made by the developers of Flatout (Bugbear Entertainment). It's extremely fun, and quite challenging. Iinitially thought that the AI were pretty merciless, but they don't actually cheat. You just have to make sure not to lose momentum bouncing off walls during drifts. This game is all about destroying the environment (like Split Second) and your opponents (like Burnout) in glorious slow motion action, drifting, and chaining this all together to win. There's also other types of events such as drifting and a ""Frag"" event, where you eliminate as many police cars as possible. I couldn't recommend this game more. Buy it. Damn you Ridge Racer fanboys. We get it. It's not Ridge Racer. Boo hoo.			",1,0,4,1,0,0,0

												Picked this up as part of the Namco Bandai Humble Bundle (which included all the DLC for the game), and I have to say, so far I've found it pretty dang enjoyable. After investing a large chunk of time into Split Second on my PS3, Ridge Racer: Unbounded felt immediately familiar, but different enough to make it stand out on its own. Split Second was super fun as racing games go, but I found the handling on the vehicles to be... not necessarily as advertised based on their stats. RR:U vehicles seem much more true to their description. Although a word of warning: A high drift score is, in my observation, not a sign that a car handles well under drift, even if it has a decent handling score. Rather, the drift score seems to indicate the willingness of the back end to swing out, so a car with max drift almost wants to drive in reverse after every single corner. These high drift cars require a delicate touch, and you'll end up facing the on coming field a lot until you get the subtleties down.Continuing the Split Second/RR:U comparision:  While I loved the destruction in SS, merely placing in many SS tracks required that you hit every single destructible. And to win, you often needed to having the timing of using the destructibles down just so, rather than just relying on your skills as a driver. RR:U gives you the option to destroy, and it's definitely encouraged both by adding to your score and it's potential for shaving a little off your lap times. And of course, it's just fun to do. But in the end, placing and winning comes down to what you do behind the wheel. There will be moments of frustration, like when you're in the lead and some AI jerk three positions back starts a chain reaction accident, costing you your hard earned spot at the top, but even that feels fun and exhilirating, and makes you want to try again. Gotta say though, the SS soundtrack was better IMHO. RR:U has this very generic bassy electronica that I would rather have than be without any music, but it definitely doesn't evoke anywhere near the same kind of emotional pulse pounding rush that the SS tunes did.Many will complain about the death of the online server, and I can understand that. But when I just wanna pick up and race, I don't really care. My only gripe is that the game was never updated to stop looking for it, so you waste more time than is necessary when the game first loads up, as it looks for a non-existent thing. It'd be nice if they came back and fixed that, maybe rewrote things so that the player community could host servers so we could still play online. But meh.... it's a small thing in my book, and I'm not a ginormous fan of online gaming to begin with, especially when play is strictly competitive.  Havent' played with the editor yet so I can't speak to that, but I think it's a cool feature. Again, many will say it's nearly useless given the demise of online play, but I'll be interested to see what I can come up with anyway.Overall, as long as you're not looking for multiplayer mayhem, I definitely recommend it, though you might be well advised to pick it up on the cheap, or as part of a bundle. Lots of single player fun to be had, as long as you don't go in expecting the world. Give the demo a shot.			",298,97,8,72,18,2,64

												Ridge Racer has a baby with Burnout ?The 2012 released racing game Ridge Racer Unbounded is about the opposite of the previous releases.It features a more arcade-like feeling other than realism and introduces new features such as:-Different modes (races, drifting, obstacle courses, juggernaut)-Destructible environment-Destructible vehicles-Dominance system-New cars, tracks, music and so onSome of these features are quite fun and fit well to the game while the destructible environment for example feels pretty wierd as in the beginning you don't really know if the wall you are about to crash into is destructible or not.Now I want to highlight the pros and cons of the game.Pros:-Good graphics ( released in 2012 )-Stable framerate-Fun gameplay-A lot of different cars and tracks to explore-Accessible shortcuts that need to be ""destroyed""-Takedown systemCons:-No more multiplayer ( servers got shut down )-Randomly occuring errors when leaving a race or tabbing out-Cars taking you over meters before the finish though you are on maximum speed-Extremely sensible drifting that sometimes sends you flying somewhere-No tutorialAll in all this is a very enjoable game, especially for the price of 10€. I would recommend this game to all lovers of arcade racing games such as Burnout, Flatout, Split Second Velocity, Blur and Need for Speed.The others should probably look for a more realistic game.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never played any Ridge Racer game before, and from what I understood this game is very different from old ridge racer games.What I can say with certainty is that this is one of the most soulless and bland games I've ever played. It feels like it was made by a computer. Doesn't help that the driving isn't particularly fun. The game's emphasis on drifting just makes it very imprecise.

												I've been a Ridge Racer fan from the beginning. I purchased a day 1 Playstation together with a copy of Ridge Racer and put countless hours in that game. Winning from the ""devil car"" as the final achievement was wonderfull. Even though the game had only 1.5 track(s) did not matter, because the layout of the track was simply perfect. Than came Ridge Racer revolution (ridge Racer evolution was a better name) and again I played that game countless hours. Getting the ""devil car"" and ""angel car"" took a big effort, but the game simply played as the perfect arcade racer.Than Namco released Rage Racer and the series slowely started to loose it charm but still it felt like a Ridge Racer game. Ridge Racer Type 4, released after Rage Racer, included a remake of Ridge Racer 1, now with slightly better graphics, and 60fps. Ridge Racer 5 for the Playstation 2, which included a remake of the orginal track, was the last game I bought in the Ridge Racer series, until this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't let the name fool you, this is NOT a Ridge Racer game. It doesn't play as a Ridge Racer game and it doesn't look like a Ridge Racer game. This is Flatout abusing the name of Ridge Racer. If you enjoyed Ridge Racer, than stay the hell away from this game. I think I will hook up my old PS1 to play some proper Ridge Racer now.			",135,32,8,15,13,2,13

												Maybe the worst racing game I have ever played in my life. Long time ridge racer fan. I know it's not real ridge racer but I got it anyway for nostalgia etc. It's not even a decent arcade racer. I could of lived with the levels and cars it all looks pretty good even at 21:9. But the controls and handling make it an awful experience. Wish we had a real ridge on the steam store.			",73,2,10,3,7,1,3

												It’s not really Ridge Racer, but whether you consider it a reboot or a spin-off this is the best arcade racer since Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.Pros:Brilliantly destruction racing, with a heavy but enjoyable driving model and some great destruction effects. Excellent track editor.Cons:More game modes would’ve been nice and the multiplayer in particular can seem a bit bare bones at time. Supposedly edgy presentation is trying too hard.

												Ridge Racer Unbounded completely surprised me. It is by no means a realistic racing game but therein lies its charm. It is very much an over the top, fast cars, sexy lights, thumping music, and just energy blasted into your face kinda game. And I love it! It switches the action around quite a bit which is nice but some of the things work better than others. The obstacle courses, frag attacks, and drifting challenges start to get tiresome but they really help when you’re driving the races. After a while the challenges get so challenging that restarting the tracks becomes your second nature in this game and you take it as part of it. The important thing is that the game rarely feels unfair. If you lost, it’s because you messed up. Wrecking the town is fun and blasting through your opponents with the turbo on feels really satisfying. I really enjoyed the ridiculous nature of this game and the way it just gets your adrenaline levels up.			",449,113,17,63,51,4,101

												Sadly, this game captures none of the elements that made Ridge Racer games so captivating.It wasn't the driving physics. Each track had it's own character - the scenery, the pavement, the layout, the music was hand-picked to match the trackYou will not find any of this in Unbounded. What you will find, is explosions, slow-motion fly-by camera, destructive vehicles (including your own), destructive environment, litter on the street, samely brownish-grey color scheme, and indistinguishable and interchangeable tracks. It's neigh impossible to distinguish one track from the next, or even parts of the map. Following the course is a challenge in itself, since all looks just so alike.			",86,11,1,4,3,0,8

												What happened to the wonderful Ridge Racer games?  In this game you will NOT be drifting like you do in other Ridge Racers games.  Yes you drift in this game, but it's just too much work to actually get it to work correctly.  Why they changed the formula for what is required to drift is beyond me.			",123,27,10,37,8,0,17

												Oh boy, where to start with this one. It has the potential to be a great game, but there's some things holding it back.Positives:art direction/graphicsmusiclots of actiondestructable environmentschallengeNegatives:physicsrubber band AIlearning curveIf you like the burnout series/criterion racing games, you'll like this one. It's got that twitchy ridge racer control that takes a little getting used to. But the drifting mechanic took me forever to use properly. it really should be more simple than it is. For the longest time the drift button for me was the ""lose compelte control"" button. In some cars it still is. After you get the control down, and start getting some boost combos, it gets really good and challenging. but at a certain point of difficulty, the negatives really start making it damn near impossible to progress. as you get the faster cars, you catch more air, naturally. This is where the physics engine flips out, trys to glue your tires to the ground and get you spun around. Also, you can flip your car over and the game won't register it as a wreck and reset you. It will only register a wreck if you have a head on collision, or a hard hit on the side. luckily there's a handy reset car option in the pause menu(wtf?). which sets you way farther back than a wrecked opponent btw.That wouldn't be all that bad, but even one mistake will ruin your whole race. You can get 5sec ahead in first(if you're good/lucky), have one bad drift(spinout) or wreck and you'll be lucky to be in the top 3. The CPU players keep in a tight pack and gain boost from drafting which gives it an unfair advantage in terms of constantly getting speed boosts(which can wreck you as well). If you get to the back of the pack after the first lap, forget it, you'll never catch the top 3. Drafting to gain boost and taking out enemies are the best ways to win a race, if you can't stay with the pack, you'll just lag behind.Ok, now that i've vented some frustration, let me tell you why I've played it as much as I have.When you get a boost combo, and take down half the racers, and stay in first place, it's a great time. You can blow up petrol trucks and take out other racers. You destroy buildings to make new short cuts; all very cool. There's also a decent variety of race types. This paragraph is much smaller than the one where i crapped on the game, but these parts almost make up for the downsides.I know this is kind of a long review, but this game has been very frustrating to me. It's SO close to being something I would like to finish. But after 10 hours in, about 75%. I just can't justify trying to spend any more time trying to finish something that's fundimental flaws making it way harder and frustrating that it should be. I rarely yell at my computer when playing a game, but it happened damn near every time I played this. All that being said, I would still recommend playing as long as you can stand it. the first 9 hours were a lot of fun. it should be noted that I got this game as part of a humble bundle and would not recomend paying any more than $10  ",83,18,6,10,3,0,10

												I eat arcade racers but I could not stomache this one. No option to change control mapping, and a vibe that screams this developer was late to the genre; Wearing an ensemble that loosely resembles something you like, but nothing like what it should be (Classic Ridge Racer) or could be (Any other decent arcade racer). I bought it for $1.74 and I'm still dissapointed.Silver lining was the original Ridge Racer GTR lookalike is in the game, playable immediately. So at least I had a couple good memories resurface there. These memories promptly had me uninstall the game			",229,23,24,6,7,2,16

												In an attempt to make Ridge Racer more like Need for Speed Underground and the Burnout series Bugbear have created a game devoid of anything remotely interesting, getting neither their strong nor interesting points right. Less than the sum of its parts Ridge Racer Unbounded (aka Ridge Racer in name only) oscillates between a lukewarm 4 and 5 out of 10. It's a perfectly functional game and anything but horrible but I somehow wish it was horrible so it would have a single memorable ingredient. Everything you'd expect is sort of there; various generic game modes with sports car pastiches. A bit of drifting from NfS Underground, a little bit of Burnout's car combat, a bit of the destructible environments from Split Second, etc. all of it assembled robotically and efficiently without any creativity, passion or talent. Racing-light is the name of the game - less calories, no taste. For a racing game supposedly based on high speed and drifting neither is engaging and fun enough to keep you interested past the ten minute mark, the bland music doesn't help. Apparently there also used to be an online multiplayer mode that is now non-functioning. Honestly I'd much rather invite my friends to an office meeting than Ridge Racer Unbounded so this point almost works in its favour but you have to admire the audacity of the publishers who really went the extra mile here, I applaud you.In short, avoid. It's mindboggingly forgettable and generic, so much so my mind already blurs the select few hazy memories I had of playing it with memories of other, better games. A monstrous waste of time.

												""It ain't that bad.""If I had to say anything about the game it would be just that. It's a short shallow experience that doesn't even have multiplayer anymore but bought heavily discounted as I did it's a pleasant one.There are two things I don't like about it tho (safe the previously mentioned multiplayer situation)1. There is no ""instant race"" option. I'd love to be able to tweak some stuff up and/or randomize it and just let it go.2. The soundtrack is attrocious. I liked a single track from Skrilex in there thus every game start I had to shuffle till I got it... ofc, this is a PC so I easily fixed it but still.It's as arcade as it gets but on that regard it offers a great ""chill out"" gameplay while still being kind of challenging vs the AI thus, NOT FOR THE FULL PRICE, buy it and see it for yourself. The gameplay is samey enough that you can find out whether it's for you or not before the Steam refund period expires.			",163,8,4,8,12,1,17

												The designer of this game obviously had an accident involving a bridge support and swore vengeance against all street furniture. So steel, brick and concrete all crumble across your car's bonnet like an elderly pensioner's bones. But on top of that you can activate power (or as I came to call it the Michael Bay button) and explode through other racers and buildings. The game is actually rather challenging but it is such gleeful fun carving a swath of destruction through the city that I didn't mind having to retry tracks numerous times. It has a very nice track editor to make your own tracks and play tracks created by other people. This is my kind of online gaming where you don't have to play against other people. The down sides are the terrible soundtrack and the online server seemed to be down quite a bit when I was playing. Also the crash physics were sometimes a little strange but that never really bothered me. In conclusion this is a very good, fast paced, destructive racing game.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												I remember playing the first ridge racer on an arcade with chair and wheel. This game was awesome. Unbounded is not. It´s pracitcally the worst racing game ever. In time of forza and project cars it´s nice to play an arcady racing game like split/second, but Unbounded is not the game you should play for an arcade racer if you can choose between better games. The controlles are laggy, whacky and bad. The gamemodes are so boring. Actually you´re repeating four games modes over and over and over. The rubber banding AI drives you nuts. There´s no room for skill cause the AI will always get you.I beat the game, but i´m really glad being done with it. Now i can spend my time with quality racers...			",150,9,4,10,1,1,5

												Ridge Racer Unbounded is an arcade racing game.The games physics are completely unrealistic but it is fun to play. There is no real strategy when playing this game. You just need a bit of luck and experience. There are 4 different game modes which are all equally fun. The track editor works well. However there are limitation to what you can do. At the end of the day all tracks look the same.The graphics are good and runs smoothly than most racing games on a PC. There is no issues with frame rate even on low end PCs. It almost feels you are playing the game on an emulator.The sound effects are average. The destruction effects are good, but the cars are not. They repetitively go up in gears even at top speed. This can get annoying after a while. The soundtrack is brilliant  and is worth having on during play at all times.This is a game not to take too seriously. It is good fun and made well. Therefore I do recommend it, but only just and only on a deal.			",22,4,1,5,5,0,8

												Ridge Racer Unbounded is an underrated gem. The reason why this game is hated is due to it not sticking to what made the Ridge Racer series great. However, if you can look pass that, this is a fun game. It's a mixture of destruction, and acrade style racing. If Split Second, and Burnout had a baby, it would be this game. The game looks amazing, and runs great on my system. What's odd though is that there is really no graphical settings you can adjust, which might cause a problem for lower end systems. There are issues like I experienced a crash, and some graphical glitches. The multiplayer is no longer up, making this a singleplayer only game. It also comes with a level creator, that is cool, but is limited in some ways. Bugbear never disappoints, and they did a beautiful job on this game.			",23,1,6,0,3,0,0

												I tried to like this game I really but if I'm honest my one true racing love will always be Burnout 3 and everything else just pales by comparison. The handling, the AI, the track design, the variety in cars and customisation but most important the sense of speed and actual enjoyment are all sorely lacking from Ridge Racer Unbounded. On the plus side I don't think I paid much for it, the graphics aren't too bad and, apart from the fact it keeps attempting to connect to an authentication/online server that no longer exists every time you start it, it's actually been bug-free. I unlocked all but the last two areas before finally admitting I wasn't really enjoying myself beyond satisfying my OCD need to complete every game I own. As much as it will annoy me I have to stop and uninstall it. Life is just too short and my ""To Play"" list is too long to continue playing mediocre games.			",233,73,3,25,17,2,30

												Get this game on sale, it's amazingly fun, highly optimized, quite replayable (if your memory for tracks is as bad as mine), rich lustrous graphics on PC, upbeat music, overall this game seems seriously underappreciated. This is one of the better games out there, wish there were some multiplayer folks willing to give this a try but everyone loves Wreckfest NCG these days (which admittedly has far more realistic driving and physics). But this is fun too! Especially if you don't have a G27 wheel yet. I guess I'll try and find some other players who like it as much as I do.Pros:- Great sense of speed, as long as you don't run into anything ""non-destructible"" in the environment, so it pays to learn the course.- Polished graphics, widescreen support via ""Flawless Widescreen"" thanks to HaYDeN, super fun with three monitors. The nVidia 3D surround works somewhat, it's much better than EA's pathetic ""Need For Speed: Most Wanted"" but of course nowhere near as good as it is in real simulation games like Assetto Corsa, Dirt or even Euro Truck Simulator (!). - Tons of cars to unlock, althoughthey all seem to handle very similarly, the only thing that matters seems to be speed and acceleration.- The AI seems to be very ""rubber band"" algorighm based, with somewhat suicidal tendencies (this could be good or bad, But overall the randomness aspect of it all keeps it fun, it's a bit like baseball -- 2/3 of the time nothing interesting happens, but when you get it right, it's a home run. - Lots of destruction, which is rewarded, so keep a lookout for those targets and try to have your boost ready to go when you hit them. Hitting them without boost feels pretty silly, errp!- Great singleplayer, lots of crazy tracks, frag challenges with a truck, quite a lot of fun trying to hit all the destructible stuff.- Community-generated maps can be downloaded too, and there's a map editor.- Great multiplayer races (if there were any players).Cons:- Upbeat music, easy to switch tracks. There's scanner radio chatter or in-game commentary so it feels a bit isolated from real life compared to Burnout or NFS where the audio is somewhat better and makes the game more immersive.- Doesn't seem to be any car customization, except maybe the colour of the paintjob (similar to ""NFS: Most Wanted"").- The initial logon to the server takes quite a long time, and doesn't seem to be bypassable if you only want a quick singleplayer game.- Weird controls, but seems possible to get them to work eventually. Not sure if this game even supports the Logitech G27 wheel, I need to try. At the moment, I've only played it using ""Better DS3"" and a Sony DualShock3 (with a piece of elastic to hold the throttle/trigger down, otherwise my hand got tired accelerating all the time!).- It's kinda strange that bugbear hasn't provided any patch to fix the occasional crash when quitting the game, as they're normally amazingly careful about their code, you can see their thoughtful work on Wreckfest NCG.Overall, it's well worth it, especially if you get it in a Steam sale. Would be worth every penny if you can get a few friends together and play the hell out of it without any of those loony AI doing weird stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From an arcade racing aspect, Ridge Racer Unbounded offers a decent amount of fun, but only after you have mastered drifting. Drifting takes some getting used to. Well, lets just say that it's a lot easier if you pick the right car. Not all cars are created equal drift-wise and trying to win with a poor drifting car is more difficult than it should be. The game does not leave room for mistakes; one crash and you are in last place--so don't even bother trying to finish.There are many things about this game that I do not like: 1) The initial cars are not only slow, but they all have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ acceleration and the AI cars will pass you like you are standing still. Not only that, but the AI cheats when they crash and will spawn in front of you at full speed. 2) All the cars look and sound the same. 3) The graphics have an annoying orange hue making it difficult to focus on the road. 4) There are only a handful of areas with multiple events, but each event pretty much uses the same racing map and there is very little variety. 5) Music is kind of hit and miss, some good, most bad.With so many better arcade racers out there, this one is easy to skip.

Also enemy crash cam is a♥♥♥♥♥♥because your car position after it IS A SURPRISE - you can hit the wall or you can STAND STILL! Map design isn't good. Sometimes some walls are destroyable, BUT SOMETIMES NOT! After the cool object destruction with slo-mo etc YOU CAN HIT THE WALL WITHIN 1 SEC!Better play FlatOut OR Burnout.

												The game starts with 2 minutes of trying to connect to the multiplayer servers. Servers which are no longer there but the game was never programmed to acknowledge. When you get in it's almost a shell of a game, there's a single player campaign mode which lets you select a single car (unless you get the dlc) and a single track. When you get into a race the entire pack jostle around within a few hundred meters of each other, so a single slip can easily send you form first to last place and failing to adequately drift around a corner can cost several places. This makes progression feel random as it is quite easy to play a race three times and come in last, first and 5th place. A little bad luck can leave you playing the same track over and over before breezing past the next few.			",210,58,5,34,16,2,30

												I got this game as a part of humble bundle sale, so I don't really mind paying for this rubish. However, If you're going to pay for this game, I implore you to look elsewhere. Ridge Racer Unbounded (RRU) is a sad case example of how a great publisher like NAMCO BANDAI games has lost its identity in the contemporary video gaming world. If I would like to play Need for Speed (NFS), then I'll play NFS games. If I would like to play Burnout, then I'll play Burnout games. RRU is the very definition of identity crisis. It borrows the ""career"" mode of most recent NFS, but the concept end up as very linear and boring with no story lines. It borrows the destructible environment from the Burnout series, however, it does not borrow enough to make it slightly fun. Unrealistic drifting was always fun factor and also the trademark of RR series, however it is undeniably toned down in an attempt make the game more realistic. As a result, RRU racing mechanics become something that is neither realistic nor unrealistic. In short, this game is just not good from any aspect it try to sell. The developer copied aspects from other games, yet failed to make it any good. Worse, they also droped many fun aspects which make the original series fun. This game is basically a fail reboot, akin to the fail reboot of the Fantastic Four (2015) film. PS: NAMCO BANDAI games!!! If you, as a corporation, has allow any developer to bring your flagship RR series to fall this low, then how the mighty have fallen indeed.			",137,4,3,4,4,1,12

												This game is Ridge Racer in name only. Namco outsourced Unbounded to Bugbear, who are primarily known for their Flatout games. Flatout was basically the only legitimate contender to Burnout's throne. If you don't follow racing games, this big chain of game titles probably means nothing to you, but let's break it down:Burnout is a game about crashing cars in to each other. Flatout is a game about crashing cars in to everything, including, but not limited to, other cars.Ridge Racer is not typically a game about crashing cars in to anything. But, it's Bugbear, so, really, Ridge Racer Unbounded is basically just another Flatout game in disguise. Wearing the Ridge Racer mask does give Unbounded a bit more flair than you'd typically get from a Flatout game, of course. Streaking city lights, roaring supercars and electronic music separate it from Bugbear's typical ""redneck demolition derby"" aesthetic.But it's still a game about crashing cars in to things. Given Bugbear's legacy, it does this pretty well. Not quite as well as Criterion did with Burnout, but better than most. But, true to Bugbear and Flatout's legacy, Unbounded is about parsing through chaos. The old Flatout problem of your car getting hung up on random debris still holds true. I've lost races because I smashed through a wall and ended up being flipped in to the sky only to land facing the wrong direction. You never know when something like that's going to happen, nor can you really be sure what the end result will be -- you just have to roll with it and hope for the best. Losing races because of an unforeseen, unpredictable physics hiccup can be more than a little frustrating, but at least restarting events is quick and easy. I'm sure people who are looking for a classic Ridge Racer game are going to be mad that this isn't one of those. And that's fine, because it isn't. But it's still kind of fun, if occasionally a bit annoying. The difficulty in general in later events gets to be quite high, too, especially in the Drift-focused events.Shame that the online servers don't work anymore, though. The game constantly awards you parts for a level editor but you can't share your stages with anyone because the servers got turned off. Bad form, Namco.			",443,83,23,36,20,4,52

												Ridge Racer even three years after the original release it manages to have technical issues such as switching from 30-60 fps out of nowhere causing the game to slow down to account for the frame switch. This makes the game hard to play, especially with what seems like an ai that cheats. You'll be going as fast as your car can go and the ai with the same car will somehow race ahead of you by miles. Ridge Racer is at best mediocre, and at worst an infuriating waste of time.4/10			",196,22,2,29,20,4,42

												:) Don't believe those who are saying that game it's bad,  they are most likely both without patience and skills, cos this game it's extremely challenging, there aren't many room for mistakes, also for each of the races you have to choose the right car most suited for it. The graphics are extremelly cool, even I have to face it, when I had an AMD-ATI card, the screen was looking a bit too dark, with a nVidia one it's more than perfect. The only downside now it is that the multiplayer it's gone, but that's available also for many great games, such as the first two Crysis, yet there is so much fun in playing then, even now. It's an excellent way of releasing the tension after a stressful day, and the music it's so cheerful. Even if I'm not very fond of techno music, this one is most relaxing and joyous, you are remembering your childhood so full of high hopes and beautiful dreams.			",104,5,3,6,6,0,5

												Sadly, this game is just another example of how Bandai Namco can ruin a game with a lot of potential.  You can feel the Bugbear influence with the action packed racing, and in some ways, it feels like you are playing Split/Second-lite.  If you like arcade racing and can buy the game at a deep discount, I recommend picking it up.  However, the online servers have been turned off, which means you will never be able to get 100% of the achievments, if that matters to you.  Also, the graphics options are very limited with no brightness adjuster.  That sucks because the game is dark.  Then there is the DLC, which is still full price.  Can't have a Namco game without lots of DLC.			",458,52,39,43,47,5,43

												I got this game as a part of humble bundle sale, so I don't really mind paying for this rubish. However, If you're going to pay for this game, I implore you to look elsewhere. Ridge Racer Unbounded (RRU) is a sad case example of how a great publisher like NAMCO BANDAI games has lost its identity in the contemporary video gaming world. If I would like to play Need for Speed (NFS), then I'll play NFS games. If I would like to play Burnout, then I'll play Burnout games. RRU is the very definition of identity crisis. It borrows the ""career"" mode of most recent NFS, but the concept end up as very linear and boring with no story lines. It borrows the destructible environment from the Burnout series, however, it does not borrow enough to make it slightly fun. Unrealistic drifting was always fun factor and also the trademark of RR series, however it is undeniably toned down in an attempt make the game more realistic. As a result, RRU racing mechanics become something that is neither realistic nor unrealistic. In short, this game is just not good from any aspect it try to sell. The developer copied aspects from other games, yet failed to make it any good. Worse, they also droped many fun aspects which make the original series fun. This game is basically a fail reboot, akin to the fail reboot of the Fantastic Four (2015) film. PS: NAMCO BANDAI games!!! If you, as a corporation, has allow any developer to bring your flagship RR series to fall this low, then how the mighty have fallen indeed.			",137,4,3,4,4,1,12

												IntroductionIn the realm of racing games, competition is tough. However quality control in that said same category is lacking in my mind  There are too many racing game out there, and most of them suck or were great once, but then began to suck. Like it is with all the countless titles released under the banner of the NFS series, just to name one racing series.For me NFS SE R&T Edition, NFS 2 (SE), NFS 3, NFS High Stakes, Underground 1+2, Most Wanted and Carbon were brilliant untill Undercover ""happened"".Then it just started to slip and fall down this downward spiral, resulting in one terrible release after the other.Regardless, it can be difficult as a developer to keep your head above water. This is mostly because of consumers, demanding products to be better than before, while still urging developers to remain almost conservatively true and loyal to the previous released titles. I can understand that from the consumers and the devs POV, being a gamer myself, with a most of my free time spent from an early age to present day, in front of my PC (and consoles alike), playing computer games and will continue to do that as long as I can. I have not played any of the previous Ridge Racer games, so I knew little about them. Nor did I play any of the Burnout games, before I tapped in to the vain of Burnout Paradise. Some say, to quote Jeremy Clarkson, that this game is NOTHING like the previous games, and I would not know, nor do I care.So what about the game?This game is quite good, very cliched, but good. Cliched because of the story. The setting is some random tech-noir-Sci-Fi near future city from what I understand, with some rebels racing to really stick it to ""The Man"" and fighting the power....by racing and destroying the city they want to change....Yeah okay. But nevermind the story. Nobody plays a racing game for the story. You play it for the racing dammit. The story is Mirrors Edge meets P.O.D (and no not the band alright!!!) meets Watchdogs I guess.As you might already know, this is an arcade racer. Keep in mind, that this is not a racing simulator.One less great thing about the game is the sense of speed. I have to agree with Total Biscuit, in that the sense of speed is lacking and is quite poor. The speedometer might say 200+ kph, but it feels more like you are doing less than 150 kph at most times and some of the cars accellerate  very slowly.This might be a minor thing for some, but I am a racing game fan and that matters to me. However, as you progress in the game, the cars become faster and this means that the sense of speed becomes better, but it will hardly take your breath away.Aestically the game is graphically impressive, especially at levels that play in the night time in the city. The soundtrack is decent with your stereotypical cheap-bad taste-generic-mediocre-up tempo tween Dubstep techno ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t soundtrack like Skrillex. The soundtrack nevertheless fits the game quite well. The engine sounds are rather cheap though. They do not sound very authentic.Gameplay is straight forward, no nonsense racing, where it is mostly about getting there first and in one piece. You can smash through certain areas of the map Michael Bay style, with loads of explosions and lighting effectsYou also have stunt races, frag races (Yes, this game uses the term frag!!) and race where you race a semi-truck, with the objectives of destroying and crashing police cars, chasing you. The cars feel very heavy and sometimes even clunky. No open world here. You pick a race from one of the unlocked locations and proceed until you have gained enough XP to let the game progress and unlock new cars, districts and levels.The game is not easy, but it's far from being as difficult as some would have you to believe. Stop crying, there is NO BATHROOM, you little girlie men. If you have trouble progressing or win races, just keep on replaying the level you have trouble with and practice. It's that simple.One tip I have is to save your boost. Not for fragging opponents, because that does little really. Save it for when the game prompts you for smashing through certain areas of the level you racing. This gives you the maximum amount of XP. These destructible set pieces act sometimes as shortcuts too, allowing for an easy overtaking and win.There are better arcade racing games out there, like Burnout Paradise, Split/Second Velocity (hella good game btw...just awesome) or Flatout Ultimate Carnage (also a little arcade racer gem a la Destruction Derby meets NASCAR with more redneck destruction action) e.g. and all of the above surpass and overshadow Ridge Racer by several car lengths (pun intended). I still recommend this game. It does the job well, but nothing more than that. Do not buy this game unless it is on sale. The current asking price is not worth it. No game on Steam is worth to buy at full price if you ask me.I give it 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. It reminds me of all the crazy racing games I played when growing up. I would just drive in the wrong direction and crash into everyone rather than try to win anything! It's focused more on action than simulation which is perfect for me. If you just want some fast paced action then give it a try. But be warned it takes some time to master. The racing relies more on your ability to create shortcuts by plowing through certain obstables and blowing up your opponents rathern than pure racing skill. The best way to get power points for a boost is to learn how to drift properly and destroying objects. It's the only ridge racer game I've ever played so I cant comment on whether not it lives up to its predecessors.			",82,8,1,25,23,0,34

												Just finished it last night. If you're an avid FlatOut fan, this game is not for you. But if you're looking for an arcade racing game to kill some time, then you won't be disappointed. It looks nice and can offer a relatively wide set of activities. However, there are some aspects of the game that I just can't cope with such as lack of immersion into the events of the story because there were no drivers in the cars. While playing the game I had the constant feel of loneliness as if I was riding the streets of an empty city. Considering the difficulty I have next to zero complaints up to the later stages of the game when I had to plan my routes on TIME ATTACK events to guess what chain of actions developers had in mind for me to preform in order to get the gold medal. Also, it seems to me that preforming better than average in this game might backfire because you're going to progress too fast through the districts and you gonna get destroyed by fast cars until you raise your level enough to open a competitive vehicle.Another thing that annoyed me was a cinematic camera during crashes. Sometimes when I had to activate POWER gauge right before breaking into some building, another racer would randomly touch my car and I instantly lose control of it because of the camera. Of course AI pilot considers a still intact object as an obstacle and tries to maneuver around it which in most of cases leads to a restart of the race.I like the idea, I like the graphical part, I like the color filters and oh I love the editor. However, I was expecting more from this game. It had potential, but it isn't offering enough for a solid project. I do hope that in the future, when and if developers will start working on the next game in the series, they're going to put more effort into filling their project with life.			",106,44,4,26,11,0,4

If you're looking for sheer driving fun with a mix of environmental destruction thrown in then look no further! The handling of the cars feel just right, not too arcade-like and not too realistic. It finds a balance in it's driving. Also, the AI is pretty good, often times I find myself redoing a race 3 to 20 times to get 1st place! I look forward to continue unlocking new cars and tracks as each vehicle has a different feel to it.

												In Short: If you are a huge fan or racing, adrenaline or destruction and the 'Burnout' series (which other than paradise, didn’t make its way to PC), you will love this game. Definitely worth the pittance that it costs, fantastic game with a lengthy career, amazing track editor and plenty of Michael Bay to keep anyone happy.One game mode in particular known as 'Frag Attack' is very similar to the 'Road Rage' events found in Burnout, except you can drive through buildings... and cars burst into flames in slow motion if you're an adrenaline junkie this is definitely worth your time. You can even create custom events of all game modes with a fantastic track editor. A basic, but entertaining example of this is:- Create a track with a lot of open space (this is done easily with pre-set assets)- Set game mode to frag attack.- Plant Petrol stations and explosives everywhere.- Let the destruction unfold.Aside from this the game features a relatively difficult set of career events ranging from your bog  standard racing to destruction based racing and drift events/time attacks, set out in districts of a city with the objective of which is to earn enough points to 'Dominate' the district - this is done by placing podiums, drifting, hitting objects, taking down opponents and smashing through buildings.If you like a challenge you should definitely give it a shot.Closest thing to Burnout since Burnout.10/10			",47,2,8,0,3,0,0

This is way over the top, the ""real"" score should be somewhere near 20. It has absolutely NOTHING to show up as an advantage in comparsion to other games of this genre. If you still have an idiotic idea to try this ""reborn"" ""classics"", better play Driftopia - at least, it's free.It's all the same. Same engine, same ""old school"" graphics. Same uncontrollable cars that feel like a flying gliding bricks of iron metal. Same unimaginably frustrating gameplay. The only thing is good here - the soundtrack. That's the ONLY thing...Oh.

												So, this here is a decent racing game. Handling's pretty good, action-filled gameplay, excellent track editor. Sounds like a good game, so why's it a downvote?Ridge Racer: Unbounded (keyword: ""Ridge Racer"") is a spin-off, spun too far off track from the Ridge Racer project, as in not in the main series, and not made by the actual developers of Ridge Racer either mind you, but Bugbear. Yes, those people. Flatout. Wreckfest.What is a spin-off? Probably depends who you ask, but to me it's a game that strays away from the main series, maybe experimenting a little bit by changing up the main gameplay formula. And hoo boy, let me tell you... it sure changed.That's my main problem with Ridge Racer: Unbounded, it strayed WAY too far off from what Ridge Racer really is.Ridge Racer is a high-speed, nitrous oxide filled drift-racing experience, and this game really just doesn't capture that timeless Ridge Racer feeling. The drifting is weird in comparison, it's definitely not as fast-paced and you're driving like a maniac.Now don't get me wrong, many a person could probably describe the way you drive in Ridge Racer games as a way a maniac drives, but in Unbounded you take it to the n-th degree by pulverizing your opponents, literally just smashing them off the track. It really, really just feels like a Burnout game.It'd probably do great as a Burnout spin-off. But then again, EA games would probably never allow this much creative freedom. So again, it's not a bad game, it's just that it really, really feels weird knowing it's named ""Ridge Racer"", because it's so much but Ridge Racer. Do I recommend it as Ridge Racer? Absolutely not! Do I recommend it as a game? Sure, it's alright.I have to admit, it's a decent play once in a while, so play it if you're not expecting Ridge Racer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a letdown, I picked this up because BugBear did it and I expected a Flatout 2 like experience.  What I got was a confusing interface, controls locked into Xbox controllers ( I play on PC with a joystick.)  I wanted to like this game but there were too many obstacles to let that happen.  Waste of money.			",61,2,9,6,2,1,1

												I got this game off a sale in Humble Bundle and I found it regretful for puchasing this game without any research at all (Think of it as a blind purchase). Well I played Ridge Racer Type 4 in Playstation 1 and really enjoy the track and handling (not to mention the energetic music tracks). This version is a poor rip-off of Burnout that the drift mechanics wasn't explained throughly, making me lost control most of time. The AI is cheap as every time I use boost, I can't cut them off unless I'm real close to 'frag' (crash) them.As said before the handling of cars is poor and the music is forgettable. Even dozen of DLCs won't saved it. Better off with Burnout Paradise.			",281,33,7,33,13,1,23

												I had a great time with Ridge Racer Unbounded. Don't expect a racing sim, but just a fun arcade racer with lots of explosions and drifting. That's actually one of the features Ridge Racer is known for; drifting. But, in this game it works a bit differently. Normally, in previous RR games, you could easily drift around the map. However, Unbounded has a lot of maps with tight corners so there's a lot less drifting. It has a length of about 8 hours, and even more if you want to finish every race with 3 stars.Graphically it's nothing special. There are a limited number of video options. It does look good, just not great. And the entire game (except the final map) has an orange glow. Also, the maps aren't all that different from each other. Different layouts but always the same buildings and corners. A bit disappointing.Anyway, I really hated the dubstep music and the engine sounds all sounded the same to me. And I normally can't tell the difference, so you can imagine what it's like.[Rating: 82/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												Ridge Racer Unbounded is like one of those arcade machine games that cost 25 cents a pop, and are high octane, slightly cheap races that you keep coming back to.It's a great game, it plays great, it looks great, but like in almost all games in it's category, it has bad rubberbanding. You could be in front of a guy for 5 seconds and maintain a steady pace, but a minute or two later you'll be towards the back of the pack, even with frequent turbo's.The cars also feel floaty, like in almost every game in it's genre. When you're drifting around corners, it feels like you're driving a hovercar which you may or may not like.Being the only Ridge Racer on PC without emulation, I say it's highly worth buying. 9/10			",118,10,12,12,21,2,12

												Like old school Burnout. I'm enjoying this, and yeah it's not Ridge Racer. Since it's less than 4 bucks for the game and all the DLC, I say go for it. It's fun. It seems like the same game no matter what car or level you are on though. I wish someone would just go the extra mile and include all the features in Burnout Dominator and nail the whole Burnout experience, but it's a throwback to the Burnout type racing games worthy a checking out. I don't think it will hold anyone's attention for too long, and servers are down so I wouldn't know if the online experience imporves things, but as a budget title, it's well done enough.  I've seen enough in one hour to thumbs up it during the developer's sale. There's always room for more racers on my hard drive. I just wish they would call it what it is or make a new name, but NFS does this also. What else can you do to compete but follow suit?			",63,1,9,13,8,3,3

												For starters, this game contains electronic music. If you're a pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Phil Fish-like) that can't think about it without being an insufferable ♥♥♥♥♥♥, please kill yourself.Now, the game itself. 5/10 at best. It's fun at moments, but there are so many broken mechanics that at the end it's only pain and frustration. Which raises the question of why is Ridge Racer Drftopia based on this game?Graphically, it's alright. A bit orange, and the bloom is sometimes overdone, but it's still a nice game to look at. Sounds are good.But the gameplay, first you have to use the ""drift button"", which is basically a glorified handbrake that magically sets the angle of the car around a corner. Counter-intuitive but not hard to get it right. Then you learn about ""frags"", mainly done using the Boost and hitting an opponent. But a light tap with the boost will do more damage than a huge crash with no boost. Also, if you hit a car that has its boost activated, you are fragged. A collision between the front of the car and a wall, no matter what, will be a crash.The difficulty is horrible, some of the latest ""frag attack"" (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car, unlimited boost, and opponents to destroy) are a nightmare, the drift events are extraordinary hard and not helped by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drift gameplay, where the cars that are already quite slippery in normal races become even worse.A central part of the game is destruction. Many parts of the world can be destroyed, but god knows what and how. Some walls can be destroyed, but some tiny columns can't. A same prop can be either breakable or unbreakable depending on the context. Some of the ""targets"" (big destructions worth more points and sometimes freeing shortcuts) make no sense, and only the first hit needs to made using boost. The next lap you can go through the same wall without boost and be fine.Every car feels heavy and understeers at all times, but if you press the handbrake then it starts spinning around. The physics engine is missing, jumps and collisions usually end up in bouncing around like a retard.Multiplayer is dead, but there are still cities being created and the hourly challenges are still working.If could've been much more, but at the end it's not a Ridge Racer game and it's not really that fun.

												On its own, this is just kind of a cool racing game. If I could rate it, I'd give it a 5 or maybe a 6 out of 10. It tries to be Burnout, but the drifting, boost-earning, sense of speed, and car takedown mechanics are too sloppy to compete. It just makes me want to play the real thing - Burnout Takedown or Revenge.Also, the final nail on the coffin is the name of the game. Ridge Racer. To be clear - this is NOT a Ridge Racer game. It is Ridge Racer in name alone. The drifting I've come to love from the classic series is NOT here. This is a naming cash grab.			",60,3,2,9,3,1,8

Combine that with near flawless AI that will nail turns perfectly while you struggle and no multiplayer servers (wasn't a big deal to me, but could be to others), and it's a game I can't recommend for any price.

												It's a good game.I enjoyed it, but not as much as I wanted to. It plays well but it just seems to miss something. I'm not sure what though. I play a lot of Burnout and comparisons have have not been kind to it. The sense of speed doesn't seem to be there unless you're playing a time trial mode and the drifting is...weird. It can feel very good at times and awful at others.I do enjoy the destruction though. A lot. If another Burnout is ever made they should definitely add that in. The breakable objects not the cutscenes. I always found it weird that a sign would flip your car in Burnout.If you're looking for poetry, I recommend Hot Pursuit by Criterion. As a standard arcade racer, you could do much worse. ",181,36,8,24,11,2,15

												Definitely didn't deserve Ridge Racer title in it. All the drift feel from RR is gone, replaced with this destructable cars that felt weak when it did happen. Race is kinda hard which is good, but sometimes the hard part on winning a race is when you cannot forsee what happen in the next turn. Destructible building are incosistent too.Online play is dead, so don't even try to buy this under full price!			",458,134,19,73,45,6,59

												If you played the old ridge racer from the ds or 3ds, you will enjoy this game. This game provides no open world but you can make your very own race track. This game is hard for it only gives the control basics and no strategy on how to win. You have to find your own technique to win that is suited for you.			",18,2,1,0,0,0,0

												This is not Ridge Racer, it didn't even immitate Burnout well. All this game did was make me seek out Ridge Racer Type 4 for the Playstation 1 (Never played their racing games before) because of all the bad reviews I saw, and man, what a great game.

												The game looks pretty I can't deny that. However it suffers from a rubber-banding AI (which I am concinved sometimes outrightly cheats). The result is that even if you come first in an event it often feels more like you got lucky rather than earned it due to skill, tactics and learning the track.If your not very good at driving games don't buy this, it is not for you as it does not have an easy setting, the first car you get is at best mediocre compared to the early AI cars.Don't buy it at full price, do consider getting the original Grid instead as it is more satifying.I'm giving this a no recommend as it is a game with such limited appeal and steam doesn't let me score it 3/5			",748,193,29,84,47,13,112

												One of the worse racing game i've ever played, the control is slippery as all hell to the point where drifting or turn plain turning your car at all can send your vehical spiraling out of control, the music is a dissappoint since previous games in the series had much better soundtracks, honestly namco what the hell is this garbage? you built the game mechanics around crashing and being reckless yet you punish the player for doing so. Need for Speed 2012 was better than this and that game slippery as all hell controls to but atleast the developers had a idea on what they were doing with the that game. If don't know how to make decent racing game then stick to J-RPGs and anime games dammit cause this game sucks!!!!!!!!			",79,19,2,17,6,0,1

												I love Bugbear's approach to racing games, and I really wanted to like this one, but with the very best intentions, it's only hit and miss, and even more miss than hit, unfortunately.Many aspects of Bugbear's trademark destruction racing is implemented well (good visuals and sound, visceral environment destruction, easy controls - though except drifting, etc.), but there's one big fault that leads to a string of others, making the entire game questionable. The culprit is car damage, which seems semi-random at best. It's annoying enough if I bang my bumpers at the end of the race and the game decides that I crashed, but due to the idiotic fragging mechanism, I feel like a sitting duck in any race where I can't get a 2-3 sec lead by the second part, where boost increase seems severely diminshed, at least for the player. The boost mechanism is rather stupid by the way, Flatout's nitro makes 100x more sense.Silly racing formats don't help things either. I mean, frag 20 police cars with a truck in a given time? Seriously? When every frag switches on slowmo event camera (at least it can be skipped, but stilll)?All in all, the game feels like it tries to be too many things at the same time, and succeeds in very few aspects. It's moderately fun when the car damage randomness isn't geared against you, but it quickly loses appeal, and after dominating one location, I'm not sure I'll ever go back to the game. That's not a good basis for recommending a game, so I don't. Too bad. ",293,168,25,29,36,5,62

												I want to start this by saying that I was skeptical of the reviews I had read, most of which were similar in theme to ""I liek Ridge Racer and this ain't no Ridge Racer!"" ...I thought perhaps these were just fans of the franchise who were lashing out because the developer was trying to do something new and different to a series that they hold in high regard.As it turns out, however, this just genuinely a bad game. I want to say that it only takes one mistake to cost you an entire race -- but the word ""mistake"" assumes you have far more control over your destiny than you actually do. This game seems to roll a 20 sided die in order to decide if your drift mechanic will manuever you harmlessly around a corner, slam you into a wall, or spin you around like a top until you explode from the mechanical strain of the g forces you're enduring in your fiberglass sports car that can destroy buildings for science reasons....This game COULD have been decent. Sure, slamming your car through buildings while taking no damage only to to later find yourself bursting into flames because some AI in a mustange sneezed a touch too loudly at you while trying to pass you inside a corner makes zero sense - but games don't have to make sense so long as they're fun. This game seems to have forgotten about fun (and play testing) in order to make room for a ton of explosions, meaningless DLCs, and a soundtrack of mainstream EDM that middleclass white people listen to when they want to feel less mainstream.This game could even still be playable if you're willing to invest the work necessary into learning it's wonky physics, restarting every race as soon as anything negative happens, and meditating your way through the rage of working exeedingly hard to both get and hold 1st place only to have the game decide in the last quarter of the final lap that the damage to your back left quarter panel constitutes a legitimate risk of ICBM-sized explosion... Yes, the game is playable. If locked in a basement with only Ridge Race Unbounded, after 10 years I'd probably be pretty good at it. One of the best. Or I'd have decided that the assumedly cold embraces of death's infinite nothingness simply had to be less likely to cause me emotional distress, and gnawed my way through the computer's power cable until I tasted pennies.

												So, not a pure Ridge Racer, but more of a Burnout and Split/Second hybrid. I am totally OK with that.However.Drifting sucks. Like hard. Super hard. It still boggles my mind this one particular mechanic, which really, really needed to be executed perfectly, is so bad. Once you start drifting, there is good amount of chance the car will totally spin out of control and you will crash.“But isn’t this how cars are supposed to behave?”Yes, in real life. No, not in a Ridge Racer game. Careful, precision drifting is core of this series, where you drift around corners in ridiculously high speeds, until you reach some form of catharsis. Driftasis? Driftation? Call it what you like.If a Ridge Racer game fails this aspect, than in failed as a whole, at least in my eyes.			",585,203,22,57,25,7,62

												Guys this is kinda bad.Doesn't really play like a Ridge Racer game, doesn't really have a tutorial so figuring out the not-so-arcadey drifting is kind of a mess, and it's actually got a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥move in that most of the early cars are just... not good. At all. Like, ""potentially impossible to get first place"" not good.There are high points, but you're gonna have the opposite of fun getting to them. When the game gets silly it's awesome. Time trial courses in what are effectively Mario Kart cities with jumps and halfpipes and things are great. There is a mode where you're in a ♥♥♥♥off-huge big rig just smashing through cop cars which is also snazzy. The problem is the RACING sucks. Even the DLC is underwhelming: oh, I have Pac-Man and Soul Caliber and other Namco cars? Oh they're... they're just the awful starter cars with a new paintjob? Oh.:(			",2445,961,89,309,287,27,386

AI is challenging and the soundtrack is awesome but besides that the game is mediocre.Online is gone forever since Namco shuted down the servers and never did bother it again, so much that everytime you want to play you have to wait about 30 seconds for the game to try to connect, then fail, and then you can continue.I would only recommend this game if you are REALLY into arcade racing games and you don't mind all it flaws.

												If you look at the game piece by piece - it is good game, but when you put it together - it doesn't work well. It seems to have identity crisis and it doesn't seem to be able to choose - or it wants to be NFS or Flatout. By not establishing itself - it competes with those titles while failing to deliver on par with them. I would definitely prefer a racing game without essentially useless (unpredictable) destructible environment and weird physics (on one occasion my car went into air after driving over knocked sign or some debris) or game similar to Flatout, but not this hybrid.At first - I was enjoying this game, but after playing more I will definitely not recommend this game as it is less than sum of its parts.

This and several other games have taught me NOT to buy ANY game on release and full price.Cons:- AWFUL HANDLING (the main reason I can't stand this game) because of this the game is unplayable- There is NO map so you have no idea what kind of turn will be next and should you drift or not.- Music is just boring. The best track is scary sprites and nice monsters by Skrillex and that says a lot.- The graphics aren't even that good..- No car customization (other than color change) or even rotating and viewing them while selecting a car so no eyecandy for you.Pros:ehh.. umm... can't really think of any.I did not try the multiplayer but with handling like this why would I bother...Don't buy this. Just don't... eh..well, you can play this if you get this for free from someone but remember to feel sorry for the poor soul who paid for this.			",99,12,4,7,6,1,7

The steering is off, it always has been. From the moment you move the joystick to steer/hit the button to steer, it will wait a little less then a second and THEN steer.

												Let me first start off that I only paid $2.49 for this game, if I paid a penny more, I would have counted my losses...I have never played the ridge racer series before, and heard that it is a beloved series of racing games... but this particular one IS TERRIBLE... it really is surprising it got the ratings that it did 4 years ago when it came out... The game starts you off with one car and one race track, and you have to unlock the rest of the tracks by how well you perform... It took me *12 tries*, yes you heard me correctly, ***12 TRIIES*** on the first track before I was able to place (2nd place) to unlock three more tracks, (I'm still on them as we speak). The first car that they give you completely sucks, it doesn't handle well, it's not fast at all, it takes you *forever* to learn how to drift on tight corners, and the AI cars always seem to dominate you, as if you're a turtle against mutant rabbits on steroids... The AI is so speedy and indestructible, the only way to advance in the game is to obtain ""power"", to obtain power you have to drift on the track and mash into obsticles on the track... (No, this is not a joke...); then you can ""frag"" the other drivers, by running into them once you've obtained the ""power"", which will give you a 2.5% better chance of getting a decent finishing place...Luckily I have a steam controller to play this game, this would be damn near impossible playing this on a keyboard.This could potentially be a fun game if the gameplay, controls, and physics didn't suck major donkey wang!!!Why do they call this game ""ridge racer""? They should call it ""rage racer"" because this game had me raging HARD and I had to vent by writing this review... because you can only shake your fist in the air for so long... SMH!!!

Amaing game at an amazing price, the drift system is slighlty different to the rest of the series, it doesnt solely rely on the anologue stick as before, this time you must break in to the corner more, but thats not much of a shortfall! Graphics are great and the gameplay is well Ridge Racer! Im very happy, would recommend to others who are in to racing games, imagine burnout dominator x ridge racer and this is it :)			",33,5,1,0,0,0,0

												There's a lot of people saying that this game doesn't live up to Ride Racer standard, but is similar to burnout.Now, I'm a fan of the burnout series, having played it on the PS2. This game is nothing like burnout either.The environments in the city that you race around are pretty good by racing game standards, but it becomes quickly apparent that they are consistently re-used, and there's not much variety in them. Plus, nearly everything is destructible, which means there are virtually no hazards to avoid other than flat brick walls at turns.The mechanic used to 'frag' other racers is just terrible. It seems as if it's trying to be like burnout in that respect [RE: takedowns], but it's so badly made. The only way to frag seems to be to rub up against the back bumber of a car, and magically they get taken out. There's no timing either, so unless you're in direct contact with a car [no pit manoeuvres here], they won't be affected.To top it off, it is full of obnoxious dubstep music, which i'm really not a fan of.

As for Ridge Racer Unbounded, if you like  racing games with a  difference  this is yet another game well worth  purchasing.  Excellent graphics, with some destructible environments and a challenging race  series.  You  score points to upgrade   to new races and  new cars.  The game has   enough variety to keep you entertained for quite some time.			",4945,1930,224,565,875,79,758

												Nice - a decent handling system for those used to the more traditionally produced FlatOut (also by BugBear) or Need for Speed race types.  The nitro system is designed to pack the maximum destructive punch instead of adding speed.  Play is smooth and graphics are nice.  My old PC is having some trouble keeping up with the framerate, though - it's a bit like playing a Fast & Furious Viewmaster at the moment.  :^)			",805,300,55,101,126,8,149

												This game, while not the ""Flatout"" sucessor I wanted from Bugbear, and bearing the ""Ridge Racer"" name in the title, this is NO Ridge Racer. It's a great pick up and play racer in the gameplay vain of the ""Burnout"" series and its classic arcade style which is gone into the open world gameplay in Burnout Paradise to the ""unoffical"" sequel imo ""Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012"". RRU probally didn't garner the sales nor the media attendtion it probally should have gotten, but dont let this racer BLUR by you. It's one of 2012's Hidden Gems, gameplay is easy to pick up and play, the graphics are amazing and even better on PC, and tons of fun to boot. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ridge racer unbounded is (as others have stated) an eye candy burnout copy.   However for like a 10-30 min time killer it is good.   It takes a few races to gain an understanding on how to control your car properly (ie drifting).   It's a fun game, but I recommend that you only get this while it is on sale,  you want a simple racing game,  you have a pc controller (don't try the keyboard controls....) and you want to see cars and buildings go boom.

												A racing game as directed by Michael Bay. I bought RRU cheaply while knowing some several bad critiques, so I came expecting nothing, and indeed nothing I got.The drifting compared to previous iterations or other racing games is stupid to say the least. Using a controller take a turn, keep B pressed to increase the angle, release B to reduce the angle. You could rubber band the gas trigger, it would play the same.There is some kind of boost which does not speed you up, but make you immune and able to oneshot and make other cars explode in thin pieces. Which can also happen to you btw. In front of the finish line. While you're first. With your car passing the finish line in a debris state, having several second delay cause of being FRAGGED and being respawned behind the line and finishing 3rd/4th at best if they don't frag you again.""New game mechanics are fun"", I thought to myself, ""why did they complain?"" Well, they complained because this game lacks to provide a minimum of enjoyment. RRU is basically a grind through a set of events to be completed more or less in order. You could pretty much ending up locked out of races because reasons. Also while you drive you are tasked to run through buildings destroying them, still for reasons. The game offers a lot of 90° turns with no basic control over the drift, and it's so bad that even AI fails to take those turns most of the time.I was about to give it a ""meh"" review, if it wasn't that on my PC (which is far from being low spec'd) the game crashes while in full screen. And, while in windowed mode, the taskbar shows up. They didn't even get that part right.Also there is no minimap ingame, so you cannot plan your turns strategically as per… like… any other racing game, ever. You also have health like your other opponents, but that information is also missing from your HUD.In the 2-3h I played this game I chewed up a good portion of the so called campaign, not once I had some fun. I dare think there's none to be had here, unless you like to destroy buildings and cars and not caring about actual driving, in which case this game might be right up your alley. It totally isn't up my alley though.			",246,81,5,29,30,4,56

												First things first, I would most recommend this to people who loved stuff like Burnout and Split/Second; if you haven't played those, I'd say to go to those first. This game fits the niche of over-the-top aggressive combat racing that sadly seemed to taper off just around the time it hit the track, and if you're craving something new of that ilk, this is a pretty neat combo of that sort of thing!I will bluntly say that while I consider myself a die-hard fan of racing games, I've yet to play any other Ridge Racer titles. From what I've seen and heard, this doesn't resemble the series it's supposedly part of, like, at all. It's got the insane, incoherent drifting (the number one issue with the game, in my book, is how finicky this is; be prepared to spin out a LOT as you get used to tapping the handbrake and coasting along), the boost meter, and... is published by Namco. Otherwise, it's by Bugbear, who made the original Flatout and, more recently, Wreckfest, and as such, it ends up being a very floaty, hyperexaggerated, sort of arcade racing. It's very Hot Wheels-y. This is the kind of physics you get when playing with toy cars on the floor; reason goes to the curb for cinematic appeal.The strange thing about the game in motion is the inconsistency of this game's ""Frags"", which you will likely know better as Takedowns or slamming-your-opponents-real-hard-until-their-vehicle-goes-boom. For the most part, it can only be done by boosting straight into them, unless they are also boosting. Drifting into an opponent at an angle also wrecks their machine, unless they are going faster than you or also boosting. Boosting makes one invincible to frags. It's... it makes sense eventually, but it's not really explained. In short, you can't wreck anyone unless you're boosting, and anyone boosting can't be wrecked.There is a nice sprinkling of Split/Second here in the form of Targets, which are basically glamorized shortcuts you boost into. It's a lot cooler than it sounds; where Split/Second had you pushing buttons to detonate areas of track, forcing you to memorize them, Unbounded just has you boost into walls, malls, banks, train stations, and trucks full of explosives so hard that you just smash straight through them. It's extremely satisfactory. I mean, let's be honest, most of why I still play this game is just to ignore the races and try to smash absolutely everything. With the right machines (the one other holdover from other Ridge Racer titles is that they are machines. Not cars.), each of the categories of Domination racing becomes a cakewalk, and if you get as much of a smile on your face from being dubbed a ""City Destroyer"" and tearing down entire (unpopulated) districts, you'll love this for Rule of Cool alone.Multiplayer is gone now. The online servers are entirely unaccessible and no substitutes exist, to my knowledge, so if you want to play on any tracks not in the main single-player campaign, you'll have to make them yourself with the Track Editor, which is kinda standard early 2000's PC racer fare. If you just want to drive around solo, the main career is a decent challenge, with Domination Races that let you tear your own shortcuts through the city, Shindo races which are cleaner, more serious affairs in line with past RR titles, Frag Attacks which are Burnout's Road Rage events but kinda sucky due to Boost, Drift events which just suck, and Time Attack events which tend to be bonkers in the best way. There's a good variety of locations, from city outskirts to tunnels to the heart of the city itself. Bonus points for the final area basically being the bombed-out wasteland you've left the whole rest of the game. Bizarrely, the way the game totals points can lead to some grinding; you may have to smash into a bunch of lamp-posts to be able to unlock more actual races, instead of better driving ability.In short, this feels like a game displaced in time; very 90's in gameplay design, very early 2000's in terms of being hilariously not-really edgy, and very 2010's in visual and audio design. Drifting around corners to build up boost before Skrillex's ""Kill Everybody"" comes blaring on and then flooring the gas to plow through a high-rise is very much a unique experience, and if you love and miss this kind of game, I'd say it's worth a go.

												Have you ever played Burnout?  Think of this as a combo of Burnout and Ridge Racer, and you've pretty much got it.  Drifting doesn't feel natural, you get points for destroying stuff, you build up a boost meter, etc. etc.  Realistic racing this ain't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												even at the low low price of £2.99 with all the DLC I kinda felt like I had wasted my time and I know at this point I've not even cracked the 1 hour mark.This is not Ridge Racer. smooth chaining of drifts rarly happen and it just does not have that same feel of speed. Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.Also I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.I was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game. This even at the hugly cut price was just crap.This game tried to be a more edgy and aggressive game to go against other similar titles at the time and IMO Just buy Burnout PC its a far better game and looks just as good.

												This is one of those games that the Yes/No binary just doesn't work for. It's a fun game so despite it's flaws, I can't say don't buy it, but at the same time it has a ton of problems that make it hard to recommend. To start, it's a really fun super arcade-ish experience. A budget Burnout clone that is more Burnout than what we got with Paradise. But that is also a negative, since Ridge Racer was noting like Burnout, making this a very poorly executed Ridge Racer game. For better or worse, it's just not faithful to the license.   The game also suffers from some poor design decisions. The MP servers were shutdown, but each time you launch the game, you have to wait for 2 full mins while the game attempts to connect to those now non-existent servers. This gets really annoying over time as the game also crashes more often than I'd consider reasonable.But on the flip side, the game has some amazingly well designed tracks and set-pieces that make for some tense and compelling action that really suck you into the chaotic fray.All in all the game is a mixed bag. Almost a perfect 50 / 50 split between “this is amazing, I want to play this forever” and “this game is so broken it boarders on unplayable and should be pulled from Steam”, it's a bi-polar hodgepodge of awesome and awful.I guess I'll give it the thumbs up, and say grab it on a deep discount, but just know, it's definitely a roll of the dice and extremely flawed. For every minute of fun, you'll suffer a minute of mysery.			",861,189,88,79,73,18,74

 • Brief Summary • Ridge Racer: Unbounded is part of the Ridge Racer series. It features gameplay mechanics extremely similar to GRID; destructible environments, destructible cars, and drifting. Fans of the series might be disappointing with this installment of the game, as it is completely different and essentially acts like a GRID wannabe, as well as far more DLC than is needed. The game itself is boring and uninspired, with no real sense of progression. Fans might also be disappointed with the fact that the cars are no longer fictional. • Analysis •  Story ~ 1✬ / 6✬No real plot involved with this game: just an all out destruction fest to get money and buy cars. Gameplay ~ 2✬ / 6✬Ridge Racer: Unbounded features gameplay features not too dissimilar to GRID and other such titles. While having a few bugs, it has no sense of progression, essentially requiring you to destroy the city and surroundings to gain points and to unlock further similar races. It does feature some other types of modes where you have to drift and gain points with a time limit ticking, and another where you drive a truck, although both are seldom. The car also functions unintuitively and could get frustrating. It is also worth to mention that the multiplayer feature is simply dead, as the servers have been shut down. Anything that requires a server to be accessed is unusable. Music & Sound ~ 3✬ / 6✬The music in Ridge Racer: Unbounded is mainly compose of remixes and former viral songs, with seemingly no original compositions. Essentially, you've likely heard half the soundtrack already just being on the internet.  Graphics ~ 4✬ / 6✬The graphics in Ridge Racer: Unbounded are clean and beautiful, but certain models could glitch, especially the cars when they suffer damage. The interface and the overall design while driving is only slightly reminiscent to previous Ridge Racer games, but mostly inspired by other games. • TL;DR • + Lots of missions and gameplay.+ Upbeat music.- The focus is destruction, not racing.- Multiplayer and anything related to it is dead.- Far too much useless DLC.- Copies GRID, DIRT, and Need For Speed.- Unoriginal music, essentially a mixtape.- Glitched controls.

												The slow-mo crashes look cool, especially since just about everything short of entire buildings is destructable. That's where the positive stuff ends.For one, when you start the game it's immediately obvious that PC wasn't the lead platform. The options that you can change are minimal, so you won't be able to get rid of the disgusting instagram filters and nauseating overused bloom effects that make the entire game look like a trashy CoD killstreak montage video. And that's just one of the game's smaller problems. The physics are horrifying, and I don't say that from the perspective of some elitist sim-only race enthusiast; I LOVE arcade racers, and the games that Bugbear made before this one (Flatout 1 and 2) were both tons of fun. Ridge Racer has always been about speed and control, but something is definitely off with the handling model here. Cars feel like absolute tanks when you're driving in a straight line, but initiate a drift and suddenly your car will feel as weightless as a paper airplane. I know that's kind of how drifts are supposed to feel (in a very VERY simplified, vague sense), but it shouldn't be that exaggerated in ANY game. On top of that, in the time that it takes to get used to the handling model, you'll realize that you've seen just about every game mode that Ridge Racer Unbounded has to offer. It's extremely repetitive. I've re-installed this game on 3 or 4 separate occasions, and I've really tried to give it a second chance more than once. I'm disappointed every time.Save your money. Bugbear's older games from the Flatout series are fantastic, and their new game Wreckfest (Next Car Game) is a little more on the realistic side but it's more fun than this. I'd skip RR:U if I were you.			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

												I like the Ridge Racer series a lot. I like the Flatout Series a lot. I'm mostly indifferent about RR:U. However, if I were simply indifferent I wouldn't review this game at all. I have to go through the effort of disuading purchase of the game simply for the removal of its online services. But while I'm here for that I may as well talk about its snoozefest content.So accessing other user's content and the majority of online services are gone. What's left of it is a mediocre racing game having little of the charm of either Flatout or Ridge Racer. Yes, stuff blows up and Yes, there's super exaggerated drifting. A clear connection is drawn to RidgeRacer and Bugbear, but sadly, the drift mechanics feel weak and are poorly implemented compared to other RR games. As for the destruction, it comes off as canned and grows largely unimpressive as believeability escapes with the game choosing what can and cannot be taken apart. That and the cookie cutter maps and environment start running together and weren't that great looking in the first place.As it is, it should be in an arcade cabinet at Chuckee Cheese. If you're looking for an arcade racer to really stay with, I'd pick up almost anything else. If it's priced at like a dollar and you're only expecting that much out of it, you wont be as disapointed.			",258,54,11,27,9,2,30

												I don't know what this game is supposed to be. As a racing game it is unexciting, and as a destruction game it doesn't have enough explosions. There aren't enough cars or tracks to choose from early on. Colours are limited.Everything has to be unlocked and winning is nigh on impossible.It is also a drifting game. I hate drifting games.

												This is not Ridge Racer !!! Atleast not as i know it. Its more like a mix of Need for speed and Burnout.Now they all have differant kind of stuff you need to do along the road ..that is not the Rigde Racer i know of.Dissapointing ? yes i would say so..the cars have zero feedback and most cars react all the same.No online server so basically its one player mode only			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A few years ago, a friend of mine talked me into this game.  I did horribly and assumed it was because I was terrible at racing games (spoiler alert, I'm not THAT bad).  I came back to the game for some entertainment while Dirt 3 is installing, and some poor entertainment it was.  And I'd like to think I've got a little bit more racing game experience behind me at this point.  The drifting controls are abominable, the boost mechanic is overpowered (rear-ending someone while boosting kills them).  Also, I've heard tell that the multiplayer is down.  And the car selection is pretty limited as well, even if you bother to go through and unlock things.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this game.			",143,22,5,25,16,0,12

												This game is more of a mix of elements from Split Second, Blur, and Burnout. The only thing ""Ridge Racer"" about this game to me are the light trails when boosting. Although not surpassing any gameplay elements from any of those games, the soundtrack is HOT, and because of mixing those games up, the action is NON-STOP. Watch the Steam trailer, because what you will see is actually what you will get. Even the music is taken from the game. User created tracks ensure longer replay value. It's a great addition to anyone's virtual racing collection.			",196,41,8,21,13,0,11

												While the game itself wasn't bad it had nothing to do with Ridge Racer. With the online component having been taken down sometimes (almost all the time) the game can't even get through the achievent check when the game starts. If you're looking for a racing game for the love of all look at something else unless you enjoy staring at a black screen telling you it's doing something (but doing nothing).			",203,13,14,6,10,1,9

												Definitely a decent arcade-racer, but it gave me the same impression GRiD 2 did: It's not sure what it wants to be, and it just ends-up feeling mushy.Drifting, as you'd imagine, is a central mechanic in games of this genre. And while they do require practice & nuance to do well in Unbounded, they just never feel good to pull off, and feel wildly inconsistent most of the time.After I figured-out the drifting was something I didn't enjoy (even when I got decent with them), I tried to just race clean & fast, and take corners with an optimal driving-line instead. And surprisingly, it worked-out, and I actually got rewarded for finding ways to take tough corners at optimal speed (even just barely touching a wall can knock-off a lot of your momentum). Not something I expected from an arcade-racer, and I got some enjoyment out of that aspect.And now, the issue of rubber-banding: Surprisingly, Unbounded does NOT have it. Or, at least, I couldn't tell if it was there. If I raced really well and maintained optimum speed on corners, I would usually be 2-or-3 seconds ahead of my opponents, and I'd stay that far ahead for the duration of the race - they'd only encroach if I messed something up. Although, courses with lots of straight-aways are another story: They usually inexplicably sped ahead of me during long stretches of track, even if I was way ahead of them on the last corner. Not a huge issue, but it can feel unfair when the AI magically speed past you if the finish-line is at the end of a long piece of track.What I want out of a racer is either a) an authentic simulation that rewards good driving or b) a crazy arcade game that still has its nuances. Unbounded doesn't deliver either for me. Its drifting feels really bad, so that cuts-out the arcadey-but-naunced aspect for me. And the physics & handling are too arcadey to make optimal driving-lines feel good, so it's not in the authentic category either. It feels like a strange game that has no identity.Unbounded's definitely not a bad game by any means, but there are many, many other better racers out there. Play them instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun racer, but there is more than one hair in this soup:The technical issues are rather minor: No cloud support and literally zero settings to adjust the graphics beyond their resolution. But the art direction of the title is mostly quite elegant and it looks and runs well, so these are more representative of a lack of effort than any serious problems.One of the problems is the drifting: It's a game all about drifting, it's the core mechanic and what the series is known for, so it's the one thing they had to absolutely get right. But I'm not sure they did, at least not entirely - it ended up both unrealisitc and surprisingly hard to control.Unrealistic drifting in an arcade racer isn't a problem, sacrificing realism for speed, control and fun is what you expect.In RRU it requires some skill to learn and master its magic-physics based drifting mechanic - and you stand zero chance in the game until you have wrapped your brain around it. And the game certainly doesn't help you with that at all.However, this will eventually happen and once it clicks, the game mechanic works reasonably well.There is neither a difficulty curve nor any difficulty settings. The AI knows only one mode and it's merciless. Screw up once and you can restart the race in many of the (not even that short) events and its easy to screw up: in good old Bugbear fashion you can drift out of 80% of all curves without losing any speed and the remaining 20% (often placed right enar the finish line) will kill you and effectively end any chance of winning a race - there is no rewind mechanic either. There's a fine line between satisfyingly difficult and unfairly punishing and this game walks this line like Barney Gumble.I found it shockingly hard to advance in the beginning - now that I unlocked almost all of the tracks and cars and learned the mechanics I'm dominating many of the later events left and right. But returning to some of the earliest races, with better cars and much improved skills and I'm still unable to properly pass them. That's what I meant when I said something went terribly wrong in playtesting.The AI is weird. There doesn't seem to be any rubber banding (although it feels like they somehow speed up near the finish line, almost like the opposite of rubber banding) and they aren't overly aggressive (it may frag you once per race so you can get points for fragging your ""rival"") but they are also completely inhuman: They never create any shortcuts (the other core mechanic of this game) but readily take them if available, basically make zero mistakes, take some corners faster than they should be able to and are generally very fast.It just feels unnatural and at times just punishingly unfair.There are other little details, for example the displayed speed. While RRU certainly conveys a good sense, the speed of your car bears almost no resemblance to the speed actually displayed on the screen.The tracks look nice and are fun to drive, but since they are all made from the same building blocks and all have the same setting the ""infinite possibilities"" end up feeling a lot more samey and repetitive than those of other racers.This all sounds a lot harsher than it should be: The more I play the more I'm enjoying this game and there are many times when I'm having a blast. And it keeps drawing me back in. Much like ""The Binding of Isaac"" I disliked it at first but it constantly made me come back for more.I certainly got my money's worth and then some out of this game, so I guess at this point I should fully recommend it. I'm not disappointed by what I got, but more by some this game's wasted potential: With a bit more polish, some extra playtesting and some better decision making during the development process this could have been a classic - as it stands it's fun but flawed.

[end note]this game is fantastic.

												Wow, I wasn't expecting this to be very good, but I bought it on sale on the strength of the demo. You might not know it, but the developers are Bugbear, the guys behind the Flatout series. This title is a meaty arcade racer with lots of destructible elements over some really immersive urban tracks. Over a dozen unique cars and a reasonable AI that make each new stage a fresh experience. Stacks of unlockables will polarise opinion, as will the fact that the game is unashamedly a console port. The editor has two modes, one simple tile based one and one where the user can hand place objects all over their courses. A gazillion user made tracks ensure that you're never short of new maps to race on. The best way that I can sum it up is a mish mash of Trackmania and Flatout.

												Terrible stuttering issues where the game slows down and speeds up with no apparent reason. Drifting is inconsistent and seems to not work consistently, sometimes you don't drift at all and sometimes you do a spin. Collision damage seems unpredictable, sometimes you'll wreck another car with a tap and sometimes you'll hit them at high speed while boosting and get nothing for it.Also, too many obstacles that slow you down (rather than destroy you). The game tries to be fast paced, but obstacles that force you to stop/spin around/slow down massively ruin the flow. Seems like to get the pace it wants a collision should either wreck you, or slow you down a tiny bit. You end up wasting time trying to turn a sluggish♥♥♥♥♥car around, wishing you'd hit the obstacle that little bit harder to get wrecked because then you'd get back in the race faster.

												I came from playing the original Ridge Racers. The games were fast-paced, joyous, and celebrated the mechanical marvel of the automobile. Unbounded disagrees. The game takes place in Shatter City, where for some reason, people live oppressed or something. The story of fighting the system through vehicular mayhem just kinda feels silly to me. It's like the game treats cars as a way to complete its objective, rather than celebrating racing. And that's disappointing. While it is alright, I can't say in good confidence that I'd reccommend this as a Ridge Racer game. Maybe a new Burnout title or a Flatout title, or even its own IP. But this is not Ridge Racer.

												even at the low low price of £2.99 with all the DLC I kinda felt like I had wasted my time and I know at this point I've not even cracked the 1 hour mark.This is not Ridge Racer. smooth chaining of drifts rarly happen and it just does not have that same feel of speed. Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.Also I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.I was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game. This even at the hugly cut price was just crap.This game tried to be a more edgy and aggressive game to go against other similar titles at the time and IMO Just buy Burnout PC its a far better game and looks just as good.

												It's a fun racer, but there is more than one hair in this soup:The technical issues are rather minor: No cloud support and literally zero settings to adjust the graphics beyond their resolution. But the art direction of the title is mostly quite elegant and it looks and runs well, so these are more representative of a lack of effort than any serious problems.One of the problems is the drifting: It's a game all about drifting, it's the core mechanic and what the series is known for, so it's the one thing they had to absolutely get right. But I'm not sure they did, at least not entirely - it ended up both unrealisitc and surprisingly hard to control.Unrealistic drifting in an arcade racer isn't a problem, sacrificing realism for speed, control and fun is what you expect.In RRU it requires some skill to learn and master its magic-physics based drifting mechanic - and you stand zero chance in the game until you have wrapped your brain around it. And the game certainly doesn't help you with that at all.However, this will eventually happen and once it clicks, the game mechanic works reasonably well.There is neither a difficulty curve nor any difficulty settings. The AI knows only one mode and it's merciless. Screw up once and you can restart the race in many of the (not even that short) events and its easy to screw up: in good old Bugbear fashion you can drift out of 80% of all curves without losing any speed and the remaining 20% (often placed right enar the finish line) will kill you and effectively end any chance of winning a race - there is no rewind mechanic either. There's a fine line between satisfyingly difficult and unfairly punishing and this game walks this line like Barney Gumble.I found it shockingly hard to advance in the beginning - now that I unlocked almost all of the tracks and cars and learned the mechanics I'm dominating many of the later events left and right. But returning to some of the earliest races, with better cars and much improved skills and I'm still unable to properly pass them. That's what I meant when I said something went terribly wrong in playtesting.The AI is weird. There doesn't seem to be any rubber banding (although it feels like they somehow speed up near the finish line, almost like the opposite of rubber banding) and they aren't overly aggressive (it may frag you once per race so you can get points for fragging your ""rival"") but they are also completely inhuman: They never create any shortcuts (the other core mechanic of this game) but readily take them if available, basically make zero mistakes, take some corners faster than they should be able to and are generally very fast.It just feels unnatural and at times just punishingly unfair.There are other little details, for example the displayed speed. While RRU certainly conveys a good sense, the speed of your car bears almost no resemblance to the speed actually displayed on the screen.The tracks look nice and are fun to drive, but since they are all made from the same building blocks and all have the same setting the ""infinite possibilities"" end up feeling a lot more samey and repetitive than those of other racers.This all sounds a lot harsher than it should be: The more I play the more I'm enjoying this game and there are many times when I'm having a blast. And it keeps drawing me back in. Much like ""The Binding of Isaac"" I disliked it at first but it constantly made me come back for more.I certainly got my money's worth and then some out of this game, so I guess at this point I should fully recommend it. I'm not disappointed by what I got, but more by some this game's wasted potential: With a bit more polish, some extra playtesting and some better decision making during the development process this could have been a classic - as it stands it's fun but flawed.

												Wow, I wasn't expecting this to be very good, but I bought it on sale on the strength of the demo. You might not know it, but the developers are Bugbear, the guys behind the Flatout series. This title is a meaty arcade racer with lots of destructible elements over some really immersive urban tracks. Over a dozen unique cars and a reasonable AI that make each new stage a fresh experience. Stacks of unlockables will polarise opinion, as will the fact that the game is unashamedly a console port. The editor has two modes, one simple tile based one and one where the user can hand place objects all over their courses. A gazillion user made tracks ensure that you're never short of new maps to race on. The best way that I can sum it up is a mish mash of Trackmania and Flatout. Unexpectedly good.8/10			",170,26,9,33,58,9,54

												dont waste time on driftopia, get unbounded instead.if you dont believe me check the other reviews on driftopiathen compare them to unbounded.if you want to enjoy this game fully, get the 4 DLC content packs (they are only £2-3 [$3-4]) :Why? ridge racer 1 car, ridge racer 4 car, ridge racer 7 car,(these 3 cars bring back memories from older ridge racer series games etc.[when i was a young [i am a adult now]).and the extra unique cars to the ridge racer unbounded game. including a ""super sports car"".[note] to prices on steam: its cheaper to get the game and individual dlc's seperately:the bundle price needs to be re-reviewed. [end note]this game is fantastic. I DONT RECOMMEND DRIFTOPIA.JUST GET UNBOUNDED, you wont regret getting this gameas long as you -let it kick in- its worth it. p.s. i ""keep calm and listen to Madeon""while driving my 'kamata rc410' [off RR7] on a custom made track""~100% respect~~rimey~ :)			",101,4,35,7,3,0,2

												This really isnt that good of a game. I would of prefered they stuck with the original format for ridgeracer games other then this NFS-underground styled racer just without all the options and fun and freeroaming, and modifying.... wow i think this game is making me ""like"" nfs more...Its just uninspiring. The rubber band mechanics are terribad, the same set of physics dont apply to your cpu opponents as to you, the ""drifting"" is awkward and feels out of place and generally slows u down, but not drifting leaves u without a full ""magicly refilling nos bottle"". The graphics are just high resolution versions of low detailed 3d models.The envornments are nice tho, and the damage works well but is just getting silly with your car plowing through huge concrete pillars without even losing speed.4/10 poor effort.

												There's one main ingredient I find missing in most modern racing games, it's speed. This games delivers on that in a big way. Also the graphics and game set-up with different goals to reach, like going fast, drifting much, fragging cars or just wreck mayhem gives a nice variety to the game while the speed just goes faster and faster. Also it's nice with a game that you don't need to click and load through several screens before you get to the racing, basically you can open a race within half a minute and the race takes like 5 minutes and then you can log out. That's anyway how I do it, not enjoying to be stuck too long in a game. Great game, best racing game I come upon since the 90s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												even at the low low price of £2.99 with all the DLC I kinda felt like I had wasted my time and I know at this point I've not even cracked the 1 hour mark.This is not Ridge Racer. smooth chaining of drifts rarly happen and it just does not have that same feel of speed. Maybe beacuse rather then huge open roads your tied to a tight city with lots of 90 degree bends it just never happens unless your lucky and get a high way section in your race. It also commits the sin of locking cars to just some events so unlike just about every past Ridge Racer some cars you just cant take with you between races. Also it for some reason has a tiny sample of colours to pick from IF your even aloud to pic a colour.Also I feel like the take out system is almost luck based I hit some guys full T-Bone style and ran a few into walls doing nothing while just touching others burst them into flames.I was actually shocked to see the Bug Bear name on the loading screen as Wreckfest is currently shaping up to be a great game. This even at the hugly cut price was just crap.This game tried to be a more edgy and aggressive game to go against other similar titles at the time and IMO Just buy Burnout PC its a far better game and looks just as good.

												If I had a Steering Wheel and Pedal connected it'd be exactly the same as the proper Arcade machines.So in saying that, there's screw all reason to brake and the drifting is terrible. But it's still a fair amount of fun. Taking other Cars out reminds me of the whole Takedown theme from the Burnout series.  Worth the $10.			",50,6,4,6,2,1,4

												Have you ever played Burnout?  Think of this as a combo of Burnout and Ridge Racer, and you've pretty much got it.  Drifting doesn't feel natural, you get points for destroying stuff, you build up a boost meter, etc. etc.  Realistic racing this ain't.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ridge racer unbounded is (as others have stated) an eye candy burnout copy.   However for like a 10-30 min time killer it is good.   It takes a few races to gain an understanding on how to control your car properly (ie drifting).   It's a fun game, but I recommend that you only get this while it is on sale,  you want a simple racing game,  you have a pc controller (don't try the keyboard controls....) and you want to see cars and buildings go boom.

> Short version:Gameplay: 8/10 - Graphics: 9/10 - Music: 8/10> Long version:Ridge Racer Unbounded is a bit different from the PlayStation Ridge Racer games most of us know.The whole setting is less ""party racing"" and more ""dark fight for domination"", you're out to take the city - a bit like in NFS titles where you want to climb up the ranks to become the leader of the street gangs, just better ;-)Also, unlike in PS Ridge Racers, you can crash and there is a (very simple, though) damage model (cars have a certain ""health level""), this adds fragging your oponents, or be fragged by them, like known from BurnOut and the likes.You also can destroy (and earn bounus points by) certain parts of the city along the track you're racing.Yet, with all those differences to the PS versions, Ridge Racer Unbounded is a great game and a lot of fun!The different setting is interesting and an OK change from usualy more ""party"" like arcade action of the other RR titles.The damage model and intentional destruction of the city adds well to the gameplay and makes things more interesting and fun.Also worth mentioning are the ""frag cams"", where your frags, crashes and destructions are shown in from a cinematic perspective.Last but not least does the game feature a couple different game/race modes like normal races, drift attacks and the such.The graphics are absolutely amazing and eye candy, the music fits well to the overall experience.Bottom line: If you enjoy arcade racers, you will likely have a lot of fun with this one.This is kind of a mix of PS Ridge Racer + NFS + BurnOut and the result is a very fun and solid arcade experience.If you're still unsure wait till you can grab it at a deal, definitaly worth it's money, esp. with a few % off :-)			",168,65,9,14,20,3,17

												While this game offers it's couple of hours of fun, that fun is not worth the 10 euros you have to pay.I got this on sale so it was okay, I suggest you wait for a sale too if you are fan of flatout-style racers.Forget realism, forget polished driving controls. This is arcade.This is not even remotely Need For SpeedAnd honestly, feels like a bad ripoff of FlatOut series (probably because they hired the same developer..).This game soundtrack is nice fast-paced electronic music, but having to listen old overplayed skrillex tracks is somewhat unbearable. But the music fits the speed and pace of the game, I'll give some points for that.4/10Buy FlatOut instead.			",422,156,31,46,18,3,52
