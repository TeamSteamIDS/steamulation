												This game is just as I remember it, which is awesome! Only problem is that for me the game sometimes gets stuck in a death loop.			",22,0,0,0,6,0,0

												Game so great I had to buy it twice. No joke I got it on both GOG and Steam, that's how you know it's a good game. Unfortunately it's not remastered or anything so it does run in dos box at 800x600 res but if you can get past that you will thoroughly enjoy this absolute classic.			",407,41,14,25,17,4,13
