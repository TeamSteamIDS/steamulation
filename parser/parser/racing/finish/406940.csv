												Dub Dash is a beautiful looking music rhythm game.

			Genna plays Dub Dash. A colourful rhythm game where you roll around a disco planet to electronic music. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

The game plays quite similarly to The Impossible Game.Your wheel/character rolls in the middle lane until you press left or right. The wheel will then jump momentarily to another lane, and return back to the middle. If you hold the left or right button, then the wheel will keep bouncing from middle to the side, as opposed to just staying on the side lane. This makes for some pretty cool looking and satisfying rhythm based movement.The visuals in this game are incredibly bright and colourful. It's like you're at an alien disco. The effects never get in the way, and are there to just immerse you in the cool looking world.Levels keep the game fresh with new visuals and music, but the coolest part is they add a new mechanic into the game. At certain checkpoints, the gameplay for example might change into a side-scrolling flying game. Where holding a directional button will lift your plane upwards, while letting go floats down. It's a good change in pace to keep it interesting and go with the music.Everytime you die in a level, you have to restart right from the beginning. It isn't too frustrating because the levels aren't incredibly long, and the music is quite good. You can however, similarly to the impossible game, turn on a practice mode that changes the music to a slightly more relaxed one, and respawns you at the last checkpoint as opposed to the beginning, which allows you to learn the layout of the level and master it in the normal mode. You can only unlock the next level if you beat the previous one in normal mode.If you want to make the game a bit easier, there is a challenge mode that allows you to complete a random track for 5 extra lives. These lives basically bring practice mode into normal mode. So you can still unlock the next level, but have atleast 5 checkpoint retries within the level.There's a multiplayer mode that allows you to play with up to 4 players on the same track. You each have your own lanes, and gain points as you are alive. If you die, you have to wait until the other players reach a checkpoint for your respawn. However in that time, they were gaining points, and might have even gotten some bonus dangerous collectibles to boost their score.I would love if the devs added a way to import your own music into the game, because the gameplay is fun, and the visuals are great, but eventually you'll run out of songs to play, as there aren't that many. It's a decent replay value for the price, but it could be even better if you could import your own stuff. Great game overall though!			",1645,509,63,143,162,24,171

												EDIT: I've gotten through just about everything now and have eventually decided to stop playing altogether. I have nothing more positive to say about the game and my opinions remain unchanged.Let me say first off, the music is awesome, the graphics are great, this game clearly has a lot of time put into it to make it look good. From what they were trying to execute I can understand what they're doing. But that is immediately where the praise stops because this game is a non-enjoyable amount of infuriating.- The gameplay: Dub Dash is an edgy and trippy rhythm game where you avoid obstacles to the beat of the music, or so it seems. The first thing you will notice is that the controls get very strict, especially in more dense sections of levels, because if you slip up once and start going off beat then there's absolutely no way to recover until the obstacles slow down. Additionally, as someone who has played a multitude of rhythm games, Dub Dash has fairly mediocre syncing to the beat of the music they use. In almost every single level I've played I've had to hit my buttons ever so slightly earlier than oncoming measures in order for my racer to remain on beat. I'm also really not cool with how some of the sections play out. There's a flying section that I feel is completely absent of any rhythm mechanics and turns into a mediocre space flyer game with very slippery controls. There's also the maze segment, which is a lot less enjoyable than it appears to be because instead of using the directional keys to move in that direction you're just limited to the left and right controls (like all of the other segments), which makes things really awkward when you're going in the opposite direction, and of course I shouldn't even have to go into detail on what might as well be called the ""Flappy Bird"" segment, which features gameplay I can only describe as ""exquisite."" If this is supposed to be marketed as a rhythm game then all of the non-rhythm segments (the flying and flappy bird segments, for example) need to be scrapped from here permanently. There are so many different play styles here it all just feels exceptionally inconsistent and choppy. If you're going to make a rhythm game you need to keep it a rhythm game. Of course you can mix things up as long as it retains a consistent theme all throughout, but this is not the way to do it. The way I see it this is just a poor combination of different ideas that didn't have a leg to stand on on their own, and it shows extremely well in the presentation.- Practice Mode: If you're having trouble beating a certain level then you can enable practice mode, where you can crash as many times as you want and still restart from the last checkpoint. That sounds really helpful, right? Unfortunately there's one huge problem with it. The actual game music doesn't play when you practice. So if, for example, you wanted to practice the song Milky Ways then it's not going to play that song and instead play the generic menu music throughout the level, and because the songs have differing BPM values that throws the entire level off sync. For a game that's all about rhythm and staying on beat this is 100% counter-intuitive and often makes the practice mode harder than the actual level.- The life system: If you crash you can resume right at the last checkpoint you reached, which again sounds really helpful doesn't it? Unfortunately there's a limited amount of times you can do this, as denoted by the amounts of hearts you have. What happens if you run out of hearts? You have to start all the way from the beginning of the song, sort of like running out of lives in Super Mario and having to start from the beginning, which doesn't sound so bad until you realize your hearts don't refill if you run out and have to start over, and if you're playing a level for the first time without any prior knowledge of what the rest of the map looks like then you'll be expending these hearts exceptionally fast. The only way to refill your hearts is to complete monotonous challenges outside of the main game mode. These ""challenges"" involve completing a repetitive map that is just as long as the normal levels, and you have to beat these challenges without crashing once, which proves to be just one big chore when it comes to doing something as simple as getting extra lives. You may also notice that as you unlock more main levels the challenge stages get more needlessly difficult, adding more tedium to, once again, something as simple as getting more lives. I should also mention that the life limit caps at 15, thus preventing you from farming up to a much more acceptable amount. In all honesty I think the game as a whole would be so much better if the whole lives concept was scrapped altogether and just allowed you to always respawn at the last checkpoint. Repetition does NOT count towards challenging gameplay. It would be a lot more fun if it worked more like Rhythm Heaven, where you can make as many mistakes as you want and play all the way up to the end of the song, and then you get a rating based on how well you performed.Overall from what I've played Dub Dash has proven to be very disappointing to me, which I in turn also find to be disappointing because the game has so much going for it. Unfortunately the way it controls and plays has left me quite bitter. It is not a good game, it's all flashy with nothing of substance to show, and it has utterly failed as a rhythm game.

												its a fun game for a very short little while.-have to beat songs to unlock other songs (not inherently bad but for this game, its pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t)-Multiplayer sucks♥♥♥♥♥ I tried it with a cousin who used an Xbox controller. whoever screws up has to wait for the other to screw up just so they can keep playing-have to beat the \""Challenge\"" mode for more lives. You basically play the same songs but with different obstacles. Basically relearning that ♥♥♥♥ing song you just learned to do.-NO WORKSHOP TOOLS (♥♥♥♥ing really?)They start you off with some Lives incase you screw up and since each time you screw up just once it costs you a life and you get to start almost from where you died, unless you have no lives then you just restart from the beginning.So as i was learning the timing of the first song i used up all my Lives, and this is where the game stopped being fun.I finished that first song and eventually beat the second. With no Lives at all, just constant restarting and hearing the same loops over and ♥♥♥♥ing over.Then i got to the 3rd song and its fun and all but super frustrating and once you\'ve made your 100th attempt, you kinda just stop caring.I put off from doing this review because i normally don\'t review games but this game made me salty as ♥♥♥♥.If you have money and don\'t rage then maybe this game will be fun for you but damnit this game just needs a few small tweaks  to be fun.Implement:-WORKSHOP TOOLS-Don\'t force people to unlock songs when the ♥♥♥♥ing songs themselves are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I wanna ♥♥♥♥ing play what i paid for, not be locked outif one of those is implemented i will change my Review to a positive but only then.			",167,10,2,16,11,0,17

Short VersionDub Dash is a rhythm-based game that translates the ""wobbly"" beats of dubstep music into a giant, revolving disco ball and has the player dodging and weaving around obstacles by tapping left or right to ""jump"" or holding the key down to ""bounce"". Levels range from simple-but-tricky to complex, mind-bending challenges.The level comes to life as you time your keystrokes successfully, with equalizer-like structures popping up around you and rather euphoric-looking smiley faces silently cheering you on, all of which are changing color like a chameleon suffering with multiple personality disorder.As you progress, the game likes to throw you curve balls mid-song. Level make-up will transition from revolving globe to side-scrolling and top-down modes, each requiring a new type of finesse to beat. I found the side-scrolling sections very tricky to master and it's worth noting that they are not based on rhythm.One mistake and you're back to the start of that track, unless you beat a randomized level in Challenge Mode, which will net you 5 lives that allow you to restart from checkpoints upon failure. These random interpretations of the songs also add some replay value to the game, which is most welcome because there is no option to import your own music library or create your own levels. You could also try Practice Mode, which enables checkpoints so you can more effectively train yourself to beat the segment you're stuck on. Unlike other games in the genre, there are no bonus points awarded for perfect timing, the only goal is to survive until the music stops. Also omitted are any sort of obtrusive noises or chimes for successfully interpreting the musical cues. Up to 3 other players can tag along for some competetive split-screen fun that's sure to go down well among like-minded friends up for a challenge.So here's the wub:Dub Dash is an addictive rhythm action game with refreshing mechanics and pretty visuals. The controls are simple but timing is crucial and the challenge is high. Skill with music/rhythm games and fine motor control is required to beat most levels, so unless you have supreme mastery over both, Dub Dash is going to provide you with many hours of entertainment. I believe the developers are also planning to add more songs, so keep an ear out for those too.

Product received for free
												BugZy's Review: Dub DashHeadup Games, the publisher of Dub Dash, has kindly given me a key for their game for promotional purposes. Any and all of the following opinions and experiences are mine, yours may differ. Rhythm-based games are my jam. Pun intended. I love games where you play to the beat (like Audiosurf and Guitar Hero) and Dub Dash is a great example of them, with its fast-paced levels and the ability to make you feel terrible for failing but constantly wanting to try “just one more time.” Your ultimate goal in the game is to beat each level, and in each level is to not crash. You are presented with a bunch of tracks containing obstacles that you must avoid to the beat of the music playing by using the left and right arrows which bounce your wheel-like character to the corresponding side, then occasionally using those same keys to bounce up when the level changes to a Flappy Bird-like mode and a few others. This is challenging but very rewarding when you manage to finish the level successfully. There is currently no way to create your own levels or play your own music which is an opportunity missed out on as lots of games available do have those options. There is a “Challenge Mode” that randomly generates levels for you to earn more lives though, and a practice mode to hone your skills while you get your body ready to play the actual level. There are definitely some negatives, such as having to press the left or right key slightly earlier than normal because the game beat is ever so slightly out of sync for some of the levels. There is also mostly no beat-like element when the game switches to the flying mode, just trying not to crash into anything. The game features bright and colourful visuals which resemble something like a 3D Geometry Dash and an awesome soundtrack with music from the great Bossfight and DJs from Geometry Dash (the main element it needs, after all it is a music-based game.) Overall the game is a great play and I believe it is worth the money paid for it. It is genuinely a very fun experience and I enjoyed almost every moment of it. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys rhythm-based games. I rate Dub Dash 7.5/10 Aussie DJs. ",591,69,26,24,33,8,27

												Ok, wanted to vote Neutral , I enjoy the idea behind the game and did enjoy the first level. the second was great up till the end trying to get the musical note and dying.. 9 times.. and thats where it ends..I quickly learned that to get more lives I had to play the challenge mode.. so instead of building you up in difficulty you are forced to play an easy level.. a slightly harder one to a stupidly difficult in order to get more lives..I do like the game and the premise.. there are other options regarding lives.. make it score based so if you die you lose points, make it 3 lives per go.. make the challenge give you other things rather than lives.. maybe slo-mo perks or somthing.. the kicker is I want to play more but its like camping in COD there is only so much I can take..

												WOW! This game has some wonderful qualities to it. The camera is warped in a strange way that forces the eye to focus purely on the action, and it makes me feel in a trance. The levels feel perfectly in tune with the rocking soundtrack, and its just plain fun! To top it off, the developers are bros. I came to the store page looking for music DLC to buy, and I was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when it wasn't there. That was until I looked in my install directory and realized the devs left the music files there unencrypted, so I was able to put it on my phone and mp3 player! Thanks devs for an awesome game, I hope to master it someday. -PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												For similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/You can find our Steam group and our Curation page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamifiedToday we are happy to feature the Steam debut of German developer Incodra and yet another game published by Headup Games who we very recently ran a gameathon for. Dub Dash is a rhythm racer where the entire point of the game is to successfully complete each of the seven levels contained within the game. Experts at this type of game may be disappointed at the relatively low number of levels but for those like me you’ll have to work incredibly hard to see them all.I really enjoy the feeling of utter rage and contempt that I get for this game while playing it. For whatever reason I find completing maps so much easier in the multiplayer version of the game (I’ve not failed to complete a level in multiplayer whereas I haven’t completed one in single player). I can’t complete one for the life of me in single player. I always manage to screw it up somewhere along the line. It’s a frustrating experience when you die over and over again. However, the musical beat in this game is so addictive that I overlook the tiny little fact that I royally suck at this game at the single player – and arguably the most important aspect of the game (you can’t unlock the next level until you complete it in that mode).Aside from the rocking beat of at the very least the first level of the game I like the graphics. They’re really cool and vibrant. The gameplay mechanics feel really tight. If you press the left or right key the wheel will move into the according lane momentarily before returning to the center lane. This makes the rhythmic nature of the music and graphics really play well together. So much so that the game becomes quite addictive – even when you find yourself unable to progress. It definitely provides a ‘the next time will do it’ kind of feeling.Multiplayer is the absolute bomb on this thing. While I admit its the only thing I’m actually good at in the game (probably because the lanes are smaller to fit in your opponents) those who I’ve played the game with have really enjoyed it as well. It’s just a blast. Games are over in about a minute and you can always play again very quickly.Although this is not an original idea by any means the best way for the developers to improve their game would be to allow players to import their own music. It would expand replayability to almost an infinite degree. Dare I suggest that it would also increase sales dramatically. The addition of Steam trading cards would also help boost sales perhaps to a level where adding this previous feature is possible if it isn’t already.One negative is that the game is allegedly free on Android devices. Those who are considering purchasing the game on Steam but who have access to an Android device may want to test the game out there as a demo before committing to their purchase on Steam. If the game has been directly ported from mobile to PC then it is of a high enough quality that I can appreciate.Even though I’m not very good at this game I can appreciate its absolute quality. If you enjoy difficult and challenging rhythm based games then you’re sure to fall in love with Dub Dash.			",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370

												There are lots of great parts about this game. The graphics are entrancing and look great, and there are a heck of a lot of gamemodes.However, I still can't like this game. Some of the notes are placed so they're seemingly impossible to get (or at least ridiculously hard) in a couple of the early levels. In addition, a lot of the levels have irritating or boring gameplay, notably Sound Ward, where there are a couple segments which are the same thing for a really long time. I stopped at Milky Ways; the gameplay mode introduced there is really irritating: you often die before you actually touch the walls.Additionally, there aren't ANY customization features AT ALL. No level editor, no changing the player or whatever you want to call it, no nothing. It's just the nine levels that are currently in the game, and nothing more. I bought this for half price in the summer sale and it wasn't even worth that.I'm not going to recommend this unless Incodra fixes the problems with it and adds a lot more interest.

												In basic terms: A pretty good 3D Geometry Dash concept + Flashy lights. I'm sold.In more In depth terms: After playing this game. I decided to slightly modify stages, by changing songs played in them. Apart from that, the controls are good if you use something like an xbox 360 controller (I use it and it plays smoother than a mouse and keyboard). I would recommend this game if you are a fan of Geometry Dash and want to see something similar but different.Apparently the developers have not forgotten about this diamond in the rough, and will hopefully be updating it with more exciting mechanics and unique level design.

												You control the game with your keyboard and the menus with the mouse. If you're new to a stage, you'll die pretty often which makes you switch between keyboard and mouse every 10 seconds just so you can restart at the last checkpoint. This sounds like a minor flaw, but after a few minutes it gets pretty ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Furthormore, the game doesn't hide the cursor while playing.Sometimes you have to do a little flying minigame which is incredibly hard to control. First of all, the game only tells you only to ""Push to fly"", but it doesn't tell you which key to press. You have to fly upwards, so you obviously have to press the Up arrow, right? Wrong, you have to press either the Left or the Right arrow. Sure, you only need to steer left and right throughout almost the whole game and therefore you only need two keys, but if the camera changes and you suddenly have to move upwards, this is ♥♥♥♥ing confusing.Even if you press the right button, it's still the only difficult - and least fun - part of the whole game . You push the button 1ms too long and suddenly you hit the ceiling, you push the button 1ms too short and you hit the ground. Now try navigating through obstacles and collecting notes at the same time.That wouldn't bother me much if you could restart at the checkpoint as often as you want - but no, you only have 5 lives and if you want to refill them, you have to play the challenge in the menu. Which is the same stage over and over again.The music is quite nice and I like the idea, but the realisation is horrible. At least add ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard controls for the menu, because before I reach the mouse once again on my 20th death I rather keep my fingers on the keyboard, press Alt + F4 and write a negative review.

												This is a true spiritual successor to Geometry Dash, and it gets everything right. The beautiful 3D graphics and the rad soundtrack are enough to convince me to buy it. It offers just as much, if not more challenge than Geometry Dash did. The one thing I don't like is the small amount of levels, which I'm sure will soon be remedied by updates later. The thing that is the lowest point of this game is you can't progress to the next level until you've beaten the previous one, and as of right now there is no level creater, and I don't know if there ever will be one. Overall though, great game.			",29,2,0,1,3,0,1

												Grade ""A"" turd game. Just click left or right on mouse to avoid outcroppings of the walls. The controls are terrible and super finnicky. Sometimes I would release mouse button and it would count it as one more jump. Checkpoint system is done terrible. Suddenly there is none for like a min straight of having to dodge 7 different parts of 5 blocks in a row, forcing you to redo it all. Only get a few lives and must use challenges apparently to get more. Boring, repetitive, poorly designed game.2.5/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

YouTube™ Video: Dub Dash Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 168		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘Dub Dash’ for Steam/PC. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

Dub Dash is a music and rhythm based game where you must progress through the games levels as each level grows even harder than the last providing you with a great challenge. Dub Dash is very similar to another game I played called Spectra which I had a lot of fun playing.Wub wub...Due to a 40% release discount the game will be available for just $2.99 (€2,99/£2.39) for the first week, afterwards the regular price will be $4.99 (€4,99/£3.99).Positives:+ Awesome soundtrack in game which really adds to the whole experience. The sub-genres move from Dubstep, Drum and Base and progressive electronic music.+ Colours are vibrant and goes well with the music+ Four player local co-op which will go well at a house party and challenging each other to Dub n Dash.+ Stages change to keep the game fresh. There are flying sections and other different types of sections.Negatives:- Cursor from mouse remains on screen- Can’t find a way to quit out of local split screen multiplayer and seem to be stuck in the level- Game is free for Android which makes it feel like us steam users are being punished.- Only seven levels, but they are pretty hard to beat. May be lack of content for some people.Dub Dash is a must have for any electronic music fan. The soundtrack alone is really great and very enjoyable.  I only wish it was sold separately. If you are into Music/Rhythm based games I would highly recommend this gem. I loved every moment of playing it.Score: Buy it. ",364,222,25,40,79,2,39

												Stay away! Save your $5.00. Anyone expecting this to be similar to Geometry Dash is going to be sorely disappointed. Sure the game looks pretty, but thats where the nicities end. First off, there are checkpoints in main gameplay. Make it a challenge, just make checkpoints in practice mode... Second, this game has a lives system. A lives system! You get 5 lives and then you have to beat a challenge to get more. This isn't a Facebook game, don't give me limited attempts to do something. Third, the transition between rolling and flying is garbage, you don't get to see what's coming in the next stage and it ends up killing you. Don't let my limited playtime fool you, it doesn't take long to figure out that this game is pretty much just straight trash. Getting a refund and uninstalling.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I received this key for reviewing purposes, but this will not affect my review in any way.My Impression:I love puzzle games. I am terrible at music related activities because I really don't listen to much music, only when I workout. I went in with an open mind and was like, I'll give this a shot and go back to Xcom 2 after I try it out. The game is incredible, I can't stop playing. This would be a great game to warm up your reflexes for your main games.Positive:+ Very addicting+ Love the graphics while playing (con will below as well about the menu), very psychedelic+ Very challenging (although some people will find this a con, I love a challenge and I love the feeling you get when you accomplish something you put your mind to do)+ Achievements+ Good replayability for the cost of the game, especially if you use it as a warm up for your reflexes for your main gamesNegatives:- No Trading card- Menu is a bit out of date, it seems like something you'd see in a game made from 2003.- Wish there was more music- No custom user made maps, such as OSU uses- No borderless window modeSlightly Above Average Game: 6/10Overall, this is a good game for the genre. My rating is for all genre's included, so don't take a 6 a bad score. $2.99 is the current sale (40% off) and in my opinion totally worth it and a must grab. I think at $4.99 it's a bit high priced, and I'd wait for a sale.			",610,253,11,110,84,6,72

												I bought this on Steam, wasn't sure about it at first, then had quite a bit of fun with it. It's supposed to be a rhythm based game, but the music can sometimes be off a little which it should never be. Once I found it on my android phone, I realized how it was a mobile game before PC, but it works well for both. You can do up to four-player on your PC using controllers, mice, keyboards, and that's great.Personally, I love games I can play for a few minutes at a time. This is one I love to put on a set of quality headphones or put in some quality earbuds, crank the volume and relax. I got it for a bargain at $3, would've paid the full $5. I also paid to disable ads on mobile.			",367,71,7,25,34,1,60

												EDITUnfortunately, I'm having to change my review to negative as this game is having zero update progress whatsoever. I've hunted for some news on updates to no avail, I don't think the developers are doing much to it after seeing their activity on Steam (could be wrong).This game has the ultimate potential to rival Geometry Dash in my opinion, but it just doesn't evolve into that. What you buy, I believe, is all you will get out of it. Sorry Dub Dash, you just aren't entertaining anymore. ORIGINAL REVIEW (Positive)Amazing, love the music, love the gameplay and playing on Steam rather than iOS is soooo much easier. However, I hope this game keeps getting more features/levels, cause once I beat all the levels, this game will most likely start to lose its charm. For now, buy the game and start dashin :)			",34,1,1,4,3,0,0
