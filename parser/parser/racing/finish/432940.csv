								First, I just want to say that the developer answered all of my questions about the game within a couple of minutes of my posting them. I really appreciated that. I went ahead and purchased the game and I'm glad I did.I have only played it a little bit but so far I'm really enjoying it. Good graphics (with no lag), great explosions (I've died a lot). Lots of perks and rewards with daily rewards and challenges. There are a lot of different paths you can try each time you race and its quite addicting.Hopefully, see you on the leaderboards.

								This game pleasantly surprised me with the amount I enjoy it.Some days I log on and do 1 or 2 runs to notch a score to earn tournament prizes (very easy to get to top 1 or 2 tiers given the low daily player numbers and which earn high rewards).Other days I play multiple runs trying to perfect and achieve an all time best score for me.I'm by far not the best player, but I get respectable scores.. though still aiming for the 200k achievement (192k best as of writing this review).The mechanics are smooth and the game is solid. The levels can get fairly repetitive day to day, and quite often you're at the mercy of pick up spawns but the majority is about skill and memorising the patterns.For a few quid it gives plenty of hours of fun (5 hours in a week for me and about 20-30 mins every day usual).

								Played this game on phone for a little while now, (same name, Chevalier) with my Motorola Droid Turbo, when i found out they were releasing a beta for the pc also, tried finding it on steam, and even though it was 4.99 :P its worth every penny. Easily among my top time killers, action, speed racing, chasing, and full throttle addrenaline as to try and get further and further each time, slightly laggy with my laptop, but i believe thats simply because its a cheap laptop without a video card, but i think some graphics options like on the tablets/phones would be a little helpful for the weaker systems like mine. (seriously, only running a CPU and RAM here, beside directX lol...) 10/10, would crash into a stone wall and burst into a ball of flames again....and again....and again...(P.S. steam client version has very little users, tournaments are a walk in the park if you know what you're doing ^.^ happy crashing!)

								Short review.If you liked this game on the phone, you will definetly enjoy it on pc!a bigger screen, no finger interrupting your sight, and able to boost and dodge at the same time really makes the same experience better			",91,6,3,5,2,2,10

								Stupidly addictive infinity racer.  The course changes every 24 hours, and the sun position and weather conditions often change too - sometimes to full-on sandstorms.The ever-changing courses and scoreboards make you come back for more.  Used to play this on Android, but free of adverts and with a decent progression system - this is the version to play.Looks great, and is good for short games or lengthy driving sessions.The price is a steal when considering the replayability.

								Even though it's in Early Access it's already quite a polished game.Feels like a cross between Race The Sun and Wipeout though the boostmechanic makes it unique in it's own right.In order to build boost you must get close to walls and objects which encourages risk taking.Great game.

								If you've played Switch Galaxy Ultra and want something with a little more variety, this game is it. The game maps change every 24 hours, so each day you end up racing a new set of levels to try and beat other players for top spot on the leaderboard. You get to outfit your ship with some cool skins, and more importantly, upgrade it with special capabilities (""perks"") to help you stay ahead of a relentless pursuit vessel that wants to zap your ship into smithereens.

								Have been following this game for awhile and I am happy to see this game now on pc, don't have a phone that would be able to run it!I don't normally like the speed trail games but this, I'm really enjoying. Good graphics. Great sound track to play to. Lots of daily rewards and challenges. I really like to try different paths each race to see what is the best route i can take and loving the 24 hour leaderboards! I am quite addicted.I will see you on the leaderboards! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								TL:DR+Nice Futuristic Graphics / Effects / Soundtrack+Interesting ""Beat Your Own Personal Best"" and Risk / Reward Boost System +Global Leaderboards / Global Competition-No Head to Head / Same Race VS Multiplayerhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1625057006727485317/CC6E94B7D447C9B8F1C2E2DDE0FAE7B9A6805BBB/A nice-looking, easy-to-play futuristic racer / Runner with a simple premise of beating your last best distance. Cool futuristic designs and several pickups to use in the middle of races adds complexity, as do the always branching paths and unique risk/reward boost mechanic similar to the Burnout franchise's ""Near Miss"" points...  http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1625057006727485495/34573B9A9A717141AEE2E8D18D68B39F8B673814/The soundtrack is good electronic music as well, I hope a UI showing the artist - track of the soundtrack is displayed at some point. Of the futuristic racing titles offered on Steam, it's one that is well-made and fun to play.			",355,104,3,23,6,0,20

								Very nice arcade-style futuristic racing game.Daily tournaments with the map changing each day to keep you on your toes.Various skins for your racer that you unlock in tournaments.You get to choose one perk on each race, and while you pay credits (that you collect in the races) you can also win perks in the tournaments.No PVP, except for beating race times (or rather distance traveled) for daily leaderboard (the tournament).If you want head-to-head racing look elsewhere, as this isn't the game for you.But if you like arcade style racing where you race to beat scores, this is very much your game.

								It's definitely fun and obviously heavily inspired by Race the Sun, and that's a good thing. What the letter had going for it in the sort of abstraction this one is pursuing a more realistic visual style of techno-dystopia. Yet feels way more unforgiving, since you can't jump out of dead end and only offer one retry per run, so memorizing patterns adds some nice variants to later game stages. It even has Dune sized metal sand worms popping out if nowhere. The great soundtrack gives it a Gesaffelstein'ish atmosphere, yet could use some expansion over the the currently very short playlist.The multiplayer leader board is nice and after a few day of playing you get a feeling that it really is quite unforgiving after stage 15 or so, even the upgrades won't get you much further, so it's a quite leveled ladder.Developers are currently (Feb 2016) very responsive and might fix some minor issues with controllers and non-16:9 ratios.

								You know those times when you just want to spend 10 minutes on a game instead of sinking into a 10 hour binge? Well this is the game you need to buy!Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying you'll only spend 10 minutes playing this game. In fact you'll probably spend 10 minutes each day for the rest of your life playing this game.That's my little bit over and done with so I'm just going to sum the rest up in quick points.- Fast paced post apocalyptic hover cars- Power ups, upgrades, kits and BOOST!- Daily Tournaments and PrizesThe more you play the more you'll want to be better, give it a go!

IntroductionI was given a key by the developer/publisher for review purposes. I was surprised on how addicting this game is and ended up playing over 11 hours. Here is a short(ish) summary of my thoughts about this game.


Breakneck 
A Screenshot of Breakneck
By: Snowfox




Tags: Early Access, Action, RacingHighlights Unforgiving, fast-paced, and addicting gameplayLimited soundtrack variety, the music feels repetitive after a whileAlmost unlimited playability with new tracks and challenges dailyTournaments to compete with other players on who can race the farthest (I have gotten into the top 10 a few times) Crisp 3D graphics complimented by a detailed post-apocalyptic environmentThe ability to see the paths of your previous and best races Speeder customization is slightly limited; you can collect customization kits by completing missions or placing in the leaderboards. A nice thing to see would be community-created skins for speeders.A vast variety of perks to unlock and buy for your speeder (you have to pay a small fee for your perks each time you race)Several upgradable pickups that help with your quest to race further and fasterAnd my favorite feature: a boost meter that can charge from being close to obstaclesSummaryOne of the main things about this game that sticks out to me is the amount of content/playability. Each day a new course is designed and the leaderboards are reset. For a price of $5 in the Early Access stage (the full retail price will change at release), you really can’t go wrong here. If you are really hesitant to buy the game, just go and try out the free mobile version. Can’t wait to see what they add next!My implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10Handle with caution… 3-4/10Buy on sale: 5-6/10Every day purchase: 7-8/10Must buy: 9-10/10This game’s rating: 8.5/10. If you like fast-paced racing games, this is a must buy, even in its Early Access stage. ",334,90,11,29,15,4,17

								Breakneck is like an endless runner and has leader boards.You can earn in game currency which you can purchase perks and perk upgrades which you will need as you are scored on the distance you travel. With a ""pursuer"" always hunting you down you need to keep ahead, so being strategic with your choice of perks is a must.You get a wide direction to travel left and right giving you plenty of choices how you are going to get through the zones, keep an eye out for perk pick ups, avoid crashing, and avoid the ""pursuer"" which will take you down if it catches up with you.Every day the game levels are changed up a bit to keep the challenge up, this is good and keeps it relatively fresh each day. What the game needs though are some more zone variants, right now there seems to be 3 or 4, and while they do vary on each visit during your play through it would be cool to have a more diverse change of scenery.Graphics are really good and fast, and the electronic music is very fitting the game, again a little more variation on that would be nice since it is essentially one track that loops (other than changing when the pursuer is on you).One last thing I need to point out, while the game runs great there are the odd accassional time where it will freeze for a split second, this is real bad when your on a twitchy section, this problem has cost me high scores a few times. I noticed this happens if you head far left or right, its as if the game has to briefly load that area in.Other than that this is a great time waster and ooozes that just one more try appeal.

								Awesome game! Breakneck is a high speed action game where you escape from ailens on a speeder! It has amazing graphics and TONS of action. It is far better than the mobile edition of the game and is worth 5 dollars. The soundtrack is awesome with epic music suited exactly for the high speed action the game delivers. The zones each have their own look and chaos happens in the background as you try to go as far as possible! 10/10 would buy again:)			",25,6,1,1,5,0,3
