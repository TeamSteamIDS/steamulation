												Completely unrealistic, it was all going well, until an objective told me to place a pallet on top of a shipping container...in real life this would be COMPLETELY UNVIABLE, the maximum load bearing weight of a shipping container in this configuration far less than the average weight of a forklift truck (3950kg) such as the type seen in the game, the shipping container would collapse injuring the driver and damaging the machine and its load.... not only that but the forklift truck has no tilt control and make unusual sounds NOT inline with the sounds produced by a gas powered forklift truck.its appauling that such an innacurate portrayal of forkliftsmanship could be found here on steam... not to mention the sombraro hat used to customize the players avatar. a sombraro hat such as this goes completely against the ""The Construction (Head Protection) Regulations 1989"" which states. *ahem* ""If a risk assessment has identified the possibility of head injury, then hard hats are mandatory – regardless of the nature of the work, or the size of the project.""ergo you can plainly see the need to a hard hat is required when working in, on, or around a forklift truck...one more point, ""forklicious"" is NOT a real word. in all fairness it IS a pretty fun game and well worth the tiny price. grats to the developer.

												Fork over some money for this game and it will lift your spirits with its wide pallet of challenges!I went into this expecting a dumb joke game but it actually is a genuinely fun game to play. I doubt it's very realistic, but the forklift controls well and loads will shift in expected ways from taking turns or driving up ramps so you can be sure that if something goes wrong, it's your own fault and not just bad luck.Main gameplay consists of driving the forklift around the map picking up loads and delivering them elsewhere on the same map, with pickup places, loads, and delivery places becoming more difficult as you go up in ranks. At first everything is fairly realistic, after about half an hour you're picking up loads stacked high on barrels and frantically race them up ramps and across rotating floors to deliver them on top of a tower of containers.Going up in ranks and earning achievements unlock different skins for the forklift and the operator, and if you tire of the main gameplay there is a time trial mode included as well.The downsides are the music, which has just one track and gets repetitive fast, and the occasional clunky camera. Controls aren't tight but as mentioned earlier are reliable, and I guess they are somewhat sloppy on purpose since that adds to the challenge.An excellent game for the price.

												Extreme Forklifting 2 is goofy and can be fun but you'll see everything the game has to offer within minutes.Pros:+Silly premise+Novel genre+Some fun dark humor+Twin Peaks reference+Pretty easy to get 100% achievements+Oddly some of the best controller setup options I've seen in any game everCons:-Very buggy, I was shot into the sky, fell through the ground, and got stuck in walls-Repetitive, not much to see or do-Controls are sloppy, I know it's intentional but it doesn't make it less frustrating at times-Camera's a mess-Controller doesn't work in menusMeh:=Music's on a short loop but it's not super irritating for what it is.Overall it's a one trick pony. You're picking up and moving pallets around one map, that's it, and I get that. The game isn't trying to be something it's not. I'm not recommending the game at full price as there just isn't much content but if it goes on sale with a solid discount and you -really- liked the forklift section of Shenmue (90% of why I bought this), you probably won't regret the purchase.

Basic InformationTitle:  Extreme Forklifting 2Developer:  Devm Games Publisher:  Devm GamesGenre:  SimulationGeneral ImpressionExtreme Forklifting 2 is a tongue-in-cheek simulator with obvious arcade elements. While traditional jobs involving a forklifter require finesse and plenty of pacience, in this game an emphasis is being placed upon hasty and risky manoeuvres. The presence of a timer and tracers might give the impression that we’re dealing with a wacky racing game in fact. EF 2 really does support force feedback on certain steering wheel peripherals and just this feature alone adds another lair of satire upon an otherwise monotonous activity in real life. Instead of being another dreary simulator on Steam, this title simply tries to be funny and different from its genre counterparts. The game looks decent (though not the same can be said of the sounds) and has a fair variety of packaged wares which you get to pick-up and drop off at designated waypoints. Even without any Steam Cards, Extreme Forklifting 2 is well priced and though simple in gameplay terms, it accomplishes the one mission objective all video games need to adhere to: Entertainment.Strong Points+ Pleasant graphics.+ Fun gameplay and concept.+ Steam Achievements.Weak Points- Repetitive sounds.- No Steam Trading Cards.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												This game is pretty good, and completely worth $1, But there are some flaws that I, a semi-professional forklift driver, have come by..- There's no tilt- When you lift the forks up, she should be pulling the lever towards herself, not away.- She uses some sort of telekinesis for side shift because her hands don't do anything. I have never been trained to do such wizardry in my intensive forklift operation training.Don't let these flaws fool you. This game is the perfect way to pass time and feel like you've accomplished something in your life. Co-workers always ask, ""How do you always come back to work driving a forklift better and better every time?"" This bad boy right here's why. I'd recommend from the casual gamer to the hardcore forklift operator Extreme Forklifting 2: The Pallet Strikes Back.			",98,21,5,6,7,3,1

												When I first saw Extreme Forklifting 2, I knew I had to give it a chance. It looked silly and fun, a good time waster. For what it's worth, I wasn't completely dissatisfied. It was indeed humorous and helped pass some time: Whizzing around a concrete playground full of palettes to deliver, high-shelving to place them on, and ramps to jump off.The Forklift controls took some getting used to, but once I had a handle on it I started to have some fun, unfortunately not for very long due to repeating the same objective with no major change in the environment or challenge.At the end of the day, it's $2 on Steam - less than a fast-food burger. While I won't recommend outright skipping this game, I would suggest waiting for a sale.Get forked!Read my full review: http://discoverplayshare.com/review/go-fork-yourself/ ",509,48,7,52,51,4,45

												Awsome forklifting experince heaps better than our crappy fork we have at work. Just keeps on going no need to charge after just one pallet will even go up ramps without a push. If your work place has a crappy fork and you want to try out a better one then this is the game for you. Even Craigo would love to try a fork like this and might even smile about it. If your too old to get a fork job and have a licence like old Brucey boy play this and get the ilusion that you got a real job just without pay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Anyone who does not have this is missing out on fun. When I saw the game recognizes my wheel, I knew it was going to be awesome. After moving just 6 pallets, it was time to write this so I could get back to forklifting. Yes, You can jump the forklift. Yes, You can do donuts. Extreme Forklifting 2 is awesome and I will be playing any future forklifting or drving releases from Devm_Games.

After spending a whopping 18 minutes on the game I can say that this is the best forlifting expierence I've ever had, from lifting pallets to dropping them this game covers it all.

												There are any number of things in my day that I will spend a dollar on. Of those various things today, this is the one which has given me the most enjoyment. I kind of feel bad for getting it for half off. I actually came back to the store page to buy a copy for a friend, but I guess the sale had ended, so I figured I would write a review instead.This is a fun little casual game. I really can't think of anything negative to say about it. It's funny, entertaining, and for achievement hunters, it's a fun, easy list. The physics, graphics, and controls are all really excellent for the level of game this is, and it will run great even on a toaster. Since you are interested in the concept of this game enough to be reading reviews of it, you should buy it. It's well worth the price.			",245,120,3,19,9,2,10

												Though it's called Extreme Forklifting 2, a more appropriate title would be Extremely Normal Forklifting 2. There is nothing extreme about this game, you are in one warehouse environment picking up crates and delivering them to their destination at random points across the map. This is just like a normal job, nothing different from REGULAR FORKLIFTING. this is an EXTREME case of false advertising. BUYER BEWARE!(although this game does do a good job of replicating the mundane banality of a warehouse job with not much else to do but keep your head down and make cash)As a real life simulator I give it 10/10 RECOMMENDEDNOT EXTREME THOUGH			",474,257,6,27,48,1,34

												For a game which costs less than a coffee, what are you really expecting to see?  This is a briefly fun but ultimately pretty shallow game with reasonable graphics and gameplay.  IF the developers wanted to they could easily move this game towards a more simulation like experience and honestly I think it would be a better game than what they have done here.  The game doesn't match the title, but for such a small price how can anyone complain really?Well I have reviewed this game:

And I was surprised in a positive way. This simulator/game is actually a little bit fun. But it could have been so much more, if they put a little more time and effort into it.Graphics and audio is allright. The soundeffects is ok, and the single tune is catchy. They could have added a couple of tunes more, but I doubt most of the owners of this game will play past a couple of hours. There could have been some more details, for example a bit more shelves, and trucks/trains to load the pallets onto. The elevators could have been detailed to something more than just a moving slab.Controls are ok with keyboard. But I guess it is better played with an analog gamepad, as you tend to do a 360 with the keyboard. I am looking forward trying this with a steering wheel, though! The general gameplay is a bit lacking, though. After a while, you're just playing to get the achivements. As I pointed out about the graphics, if they detailed the area a bit more, with more shelves, and different things to load onto, it would have been a lot more interesting. Filled shelves with multiple pallets, and all moveable would have been nice. The ability to cause total havoc by making the shelf fall over would be even more hillarious. But what can you expect from a $1.5 game? And what's up with a forklift with side-shift but no tilt? I had to drive backwards down the steep ramps so I did not lose the pallet.			",64,9,4,14,28,0,40

												I didn't play this game very much because it got boring very quickly. it seems all you do is drive pallets around to different locations. Maybe next time the developers could add some sort of fun aspect to it. I'm not sure what could be fun about forklifting though.			",124,13,2,14,13,0,7

												It's good for what it is. Funny and entertaining for some time, but of course it can also get boring very fast. I think the big challenge is, to handle the controls. They are very, very sensitive and tapping left or right for more than one milisecond while at full speed will cause you to completly lose the control over your forklift.			",323,169,3,25,13,2,15

												great game for its price but would be nice if it was a bit more challenging as it is easy if it is challenging  you won't be bored for a long time it is fun for under 30 mins also another forklift would be nice :)			",9,1,1,0,7,0,0

												I got what i expected. Bought this out of pure meme purposes, and i have to say, the music is what makes this game worthy of a purchase. Even if its 1.50, it's a funny as heck 1.50.Instructions too complicated, got stuck10/10 would hirehttp://imgur.com/a/yzc6A ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got exactly what I expected. I expected to pick things up, move them, then put them down. And in this game, you pick things up, move them, then put them down.  The game runs well with no obvious bugs or glitches, it looks OK and the controls are well-sorted. The lift behaves basically as it should (and as someone who has experience driving an actual forklift, I do know what I'm talking about here)The only truly unrealistic thing I've found is that all the loads on the pallets are properly strapped down and secured. If my experience is any indication, this almost NEVER happens in real life.If you have 2 bucks burning a hole in your pocket and you've always wanted to know what it's like to drive a forklift, knock yourself out. Otherwise don't bother--you are getting EXACTLY what it says on the tin and not a drop more.			",71,20,22,24,27,1,1

												I really enjoyed this game more than I orignally planned to. For only for $1.99 you can drive around a forklift with a spoiler carrying a box full of puppies. It's one of those game where you'd leave in your library for months and click on one day just to remember how much fun it was. Cheap game, worth the buck. 10/10 would forklift again.

												This game has taught me so much about why forklifts are godly when it comes to pallets. The pallets were speaking to me in such a way that every time I were to bump into a cargo container, I was hurting them or pleasing them.  I can now pass my forklift driver's exam. All thanks to this game. Highly recommend!!!!! Beats having to buy a 300 dollar book that you are barely going to use. I saved myself, 298.01 dollars! DO IT UP!!! ",72,3,5,8,5,1,2

												So as someone who was actually a forklift operator for many years, this game really brought back a few memories. Mainly memories of doing thoughtless pick-this-up-here-and-put-it-there tasks. I know this is only $1.99, and for that price it's a decent experience.Needs mast tilting though for full forklift effect. Oh and more steel racking placed in weird♥♥♥♥♥spots with many shelves. Then have someone tell you to put something that's obviously too big for the area they want you to put it in. Oh and with keyboard controls the accelerration is a little wonky.But for $2 I can't complain.			",526,95,16,67,46,6,84
