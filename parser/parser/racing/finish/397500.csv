												Not sure why there are so many positive reviews early on, but here's my two cents. Not a bad RPG, but there are two design flaws that stopped me over 3 hours into this game:-Lack of detail for mission progression: In other words, I saved game, and the next day I forgot what I even needed to do. It was obscure. Going back to important characters did not contain the dialogue to direct me in the right direction. I luckily succeeded by chance and progressed. Story is very confusing and not direct.-Puzzle Mechanism: I could not get out of some puzzles, requiring a full restart. This is a problem, since one of the times I had a lot of progress that went unsaved. Not recommended, when I compare it to the likes of Last Dream.			",23,9,0,7,2,0,2

												I have mixed feelings about this sequel. First of all, the gameplay is still turn-based RPG, which is exactly what I wanted. The world is the same as the first game, but far more bleak and hopeless (this is not a drawback to me). I got additional party members early on, and I can use one joystick for both movement and menu selection, so those improve on the original! However, I feel like the writing was weaker in the second game, possibly due to the increase in ""zany"" characters, who came off as irritating and not funny at all. I noticed more grammatical errors and exclamation point spam as well, which could mean I'm just being more picky with the sequel. That said, I still enjoyed the gameplay, and most of the puzzles (a few were not intuitive at all, and one made me rage-quit for a day), and I'm curious to see where the story goes from here. If you liked turn-based retro JRPGs, liked the first game, and are willing to put up with some mediocre writing, I'd say you'll like this.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

Basic InformationTitle:  Labyronia RPG 2Developer:  LabyrinthinePublisher:  Epic Quest GamesGenre:  Classic-style RPGGeneral ImpressionLabyronia RPG 2 picks up the loose ends from the first game and offers us a new map, new quests and characters, while still being as refreshingly open-ended as before. I’m glad the grinding and backtracking issues are now gone and that the writing still manages to slip a joke here and there. With Trading Cards, Achievements and  a storyline that can eat up several good hours, what more can you ask from this wonderfully crafted 2D RPG? Its decent asking price does not reflect the amount of work and thinking that went into the game, that’s a certainty!Strong Points+ Same great storytelling as in Labyronia RPG and less grinding this time around.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Map seems smaller than the first one in the series.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Labyronia RPG 2 with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.       So I must admit that my view of Labyronia 2 is tainted before I even began playing; I had quite the negative experience with the original Labyronia and dove into the sequel only a couple days later. To my surprise, however, it appears that the developers learned a lot from their first title and polished up the sequel accordingly. Kudos on that guys!         Upon launching the game, by default it ran fullscreen and while the resolution was rather unappealing, the assets appeared to be improved enough that it wasn’t unplayable on a 1080p display. Sadly the select button is still inexplicably mapped to the O(PS4)/B(360) by default. Unlike the first Labyronia though, I was actually able to easily fix all the mappings and get a grasp of the games controls before setting off into the world. The opening itself feels like the devs learned a lot from the first game because there was a lot better guidance and exposition in the early game to direct the player. The story was no less generic (the main boss introduced at the beginning was the Father of a thousand evils) but I don’t feel that I have the right to judge much about a direct sequels narrative when I was unable to play the first game.         Overall, Labyronia 2 feels like a great application of lessons learned, but this is where my big picture judgment takes a turn. Yes, most of the originals issues were fixed, but that only brought this game up par with every other RPG Maker title. Die-hard fans of this style of RPG may get some enjoyment out of it, but there’s not that “wow” factor to distinguish it from the thousands of other games just like it flooding Steam.

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!New updates Review after completing Game! (for my original quick first look, just scroll down)Labyronia RPG 2 is a direct sequel to Labyronia RPG taking place roughly 10 years after the incidents of it's predecessor. Thus most of the main cast, many locations and references both cosmetic as well as story wise will make a more sense to players who have completed the first game. At the same time it has to be mentioned that it is possible to play and enjoy this one on it's own without any prior knowledge. A newcomer will make sense of the story and the relations among it's characters.Gameplaywise is where the major differences between Labyronia RPG 2 and 1 will be noticable. Most and foremost is a more streamlined and focused approach in Labyronia RPG 2. While the first game saw the fere leave his house in the beginning and thus threw the player into an open world without any clue where to start and what to do next; as such requiring the player to call the ""oldschool"" ability of being able to explore on there own without any guidance.Here in hte sequel the path forward as well as the objectives are always clear to the player. You will always know where to go to next and what to do!!!The battles however are still dificult, expecially in the beginning and require a careful and strategic approach. Simple attack spamming won't get you anywhere, just as in the Labyronia RPG 1.Overall I can recommend this game to everybody who enjoyed the first one and to fans of the genre who can get past the fact that this is an RPGMaker VXAce game using many default graphics, simply because there is a very nice oldschool style JRPG  beneath it's surface that I enjoyed very much.---Quick First Look!I really like the first Labyronia game, but I still haven't finished it and that is the reason why a quick first look at Labyronia RPG 2 will have to do (at least for now!).Labyronia RPG 2 is still Labyronia!! Everybody who enjoyed the first one will feel right at home.However there is one major change and that is a more focused approach to the game. This time around you will not just be thrown into an open game world without any clues; this time you will be pointed into a specific direction once the short opening sequence that functions as a basic tutorial has been finished.However this doesn't mean that the game has become linear. Whether you are following the directions or just wander off exploring, is still up to you, the player.The game world is still open and once again, careless rushing out will get you into trouble easily and simple attack spamming without any strategy will get you killed as fast as possible (the very first enemy got me, again XD - This is  Spar....errr...Labyronia!!!).

-Quick Review-Labyronia RPG 2 is a RPG developed by Labyrinthine and released Aug 28, 2015. (Lets pause a moment and ask ""why the heck was Labyronia RPG 1 released August 14, 2015 and Labyronia RPG 2 released August 28, 2015? Can you make RPG maker sequels in 14 days? or was this originally supposed to be one whole game? ...That would explain why the sequel starts you off at level 20 or 30. But I'm getting ahead of myself.)synopsis: It's an RPG maker game, you can tell the developers care a great deal about the lore within their game, most people won't read the literal books in it, the sequel has minor improvements which I appreciated being added, like seeing sprites attack in the battle screen. I missed seeing people swing at monsters before numbers pop up.

Community Created Artwork for Labyronia RPG 2
By: Atratzu

			I'm too lazy to rebind my screenshot, but I'm not too lazy to use my screenshot key, and then paste into photoshop, then upload to community art work. ...Don't... don't think about it.		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Welcome back to Labyronia, the story for this series is one of it's strengths (*mumbles* It's an RPG which looks like it's from the Gameboy color days of 1999. It's not like the driving features are going to be it's bedazzling special effects and graphics, or it's revolutionary game physics, or in-game realistic cut sceenes... - not like those are actually aspects all games are to be judged by, but I digress! */end mumbles*)The story is a continuation on Labyronia RPG 1, this makes writing a review a bit sticky, because I first played through the first game before playing this (Actually that's not quite true, I stopped before fighting the 4 or was it 6 'gods'  because I didn't want to grind out the experience and I felt like I was done because I got all the achievements.).My point is, I'm familiar with these characters already, and the game kinda expects you to know who the heck ""Arres"" is, because they're going to talk about Arres alot, because he's kind of a big deal, he's the protagonist in the first game!Basically crap has hit the fan, as the Starks from Game of Thrones warned everyone ""winter is coming"", but it was too late the land was covered in a white blanket faster then you can say ""wait what"". ...I guess that's note quite true because Labyronia RPG 2 takes place 10 years after the original game, but that's not funny to say.You must assemble your party again, and confront the darkness to put an end to this infernal winter. Why did it take them 10 years to do that? I dunno, that wasn't very well explained, or my brain fell asleep. Regardless that's your job now!  And the old ""gods"" are now your friends, so yay! they're just fancy mages that no longer age. that's why I use quotation marks... fakers... Gameplay: Okay, RPG wise, there's not much new which you'll be surprised about. You have gear, you have levels, you have magic, you have elements which are super effective, you have defensive stats, get and equip the right gear before a boss and you'll have minimal trouble. Expect slow progression, some grinding, and random bosses to be hard for no real reason.Oh yeah, pro tip: Equip your gear when you start the game. Because I went against the monster sieging the wall in pretty much my underpants. I won, because I'm Atratzu... but after realizing I took on a huge monster in my underpants I did blush and ask the Captain-of-the-guard to forgive the noobish mistake and promptly restarted the game  and didn't use any items on the first fight my second time through. (how embarrassing!)Other then the regular RPG elements, I don't want to go over all the same details my review for the first game did, so really quickly about the mechanics: You attack, use special abilities which use a secondary source (and depending on the type of character, builds up, or uses like magic), defend, or use items.You can use these to come up with different strategies, yada yada yada blah blah blah... if you don't know how to play an RPG already just google ""best JRPG"" and buy one of those, you'll be an expert in a few hundred hours.I noticed a few big changes from Labyronia RPG 1 and 2, aesthetically speaking these weren't necessary to play the game, but made the game actually feel like I was playing an RPG rather then a no-budget-1-man-first-project (no offense Labyrinthine, just being honest. We all start at the bottom.)You can now see your characters attack! Originally you would chose an attack and you'd just see a swiping animation on the screen to indicate sword attacks, or a particle effect to indicate magic. Now you get to see your cute little sprite walk up to the middle of the screen and then see the animation swipe or sprite attack.   ...Yeah, it's not much, but to gameplay it's a huge improvement! Feels like I have characters fighting, instead of picture frames fighting.Additionally it's worth pointing out you can see your whole party trailing behind you, the more characters you get, the longer your Snake train gets. Not even Final Fantasy 7, Legend of Dragoon, or Pokemon (or other JRPG's I've played and forgotten the title of) did that. Probably because of hardware limitations... but I digress! a cool feature, I liked it... but very much aesthetic.Everything else though...? Pretty much the same as the first game, except for starting out at level 20 or 30 and with Garic (if that's how you spell his name. Truth be told I will forever read his name as ""Garlic"", and so he's endearing to me, my little cranky old-man-vampire-repellent)Conclusion: Well that's probably more words then anyone actually needs to know weather this is a skip or a buy.  Labyronia RPG 2 goes on sale regularly, you can pick it up at a reduced price. There's not much to the game, I highly recommend playing through some of the first game before jumping into the second game. But as far as RPG's go, you could choose a worse RPG maker game.I recommend this game to anyone who misses playing classic JRPG's, and just needs to fill that hole in his or her heart. Have fun and may Garlic be with you.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update August 15, 2016:Click here to check out my Labyronia RPG (origional game) review ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Labyronia RPG 2, takes place 10 years after the events of Labyronia RPG. Without giving spoilers, I will say the world is changing, new Labyrinths are appearing all over the face of the world, and a new, more terrifying evil has taken hold of the land from the Tower of Mysteria. Plunged into an eternal winter, and scattered throughout the world, are the heroes of our story, though can the find the strength and courage to find each other and stop the Father of 1000 evils?So far, even early in the story it seems like Labyronia RPG 2 is on par with the original. Visually it is consistent with the first,  Thrust into the story as your village is being attacked, the challenge level appears to be just as high if not a little more so with Labyronia RPG 2. Unlike so many games these days, this seems to be a pretty well done sequel. I recommend if you are going to pick up Labyronia, get the bundle which has both 1 and 2. It is definitely a solid RPG and is just challenging enough to be fun and interesting. Give it a try if you like Retro-styled RPG's.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												I wish there was a neutral option. Although it's a good game, Labyronia 2 feels like it has taken several steps back, in comparison with the original. Most of the stuff that I disliked were new features and story direction that the creators were trying out. It's clear that they're attempting to improve the entire structure of their series, and kudos for them, but it just didn't work out.The cons:- Travel is much more linear than it predecessor. (In the first game, you could go to about a dozen different areas from the very beginning. In this game, you're limited to only 1-2 new places to visit at any given point of the story)- Some labyrinths were pretty straightforward.- Certain battle functions aren't coherent and bug out sometimes (Mainly AoE attacks, especially Garic's).- Plot is short. Dialogues are long. Tends to be boring and time consuming unnecessarily (Especially before difficult boss fights that you die through a few times. )- Most ""puzzles"" weren't even puzzles. You just had to move boulders around, light stuff on fire, and that's about it.The pros:+ Challenging from the start.+ You get more party members early on.+ Battles are more strategic. Even random encounters require fighting strategically if you wish to survive.+ Some labyrinths had interesting obstacles to overcome.+ Main characters have some decent writing.			",46,3,0,7,1,1,2

												I really enjoyed this game, it is a nice follow-up to Labyronia and the melancholic atmosphere is an interesting twist on the original word. Pros: a nice traditional JRPG experience for fans of the genre, little to no grinding, straightforward progression, continuity of the main storyline, and hardly any in-dungeon timing fiascos (remember the original game's water temple?). Cons: weaker dialogue than the original, occasional grammatical mistakes, a little linear, and not quite as challenging as the original game.Overall, I'm really pleased with this game and I think fans of this genre would like it as well. I hope Labyrinthine keeps developing more games, I look forward to playing the Legend of Mysteria!			",44,19,0,42,1,0,20

												BEFORE YOU BUY LABYRONIA 2, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU PLAY LABYRONIA 1. This is because L2 is a continuation of the 1st game and it might not make a whole lot of sense to you if you skip the 1st installment. ANYWAY...I was a little skeptical about Labyronia 2 after playing the 1st one, because the 1st one left such a good impression that I was afraid the 2nd installment would leave me disappointed.I was disappointed. WITH MYSELF AND MY LACK OF FAITH IN THE LABYRONIA UNIVERSE. Buy it. Buy this game right now. Buy it for everyone you know and love and care for. This game is extremely addictive and enticing. The story has neatly progressed from the events of Labyronia 1, but it hasn't lost sight of the overall storyline, in fact, from the very beginning you can sense the immediate continuations from its former counterpart, the urgency of the characters to survive, to the point where you must pay careful attention to your surroundings, conversations, HEALTH METERS, and manliness.The game does prove to be more challenging than the first one. You need to be very careful with where and how you spend your money (however, DO NOT BE A MISER, you will need several items to get through the game), you don't need to grind, but you do need to be very tactful in your battles, especially with the bosses that you will face. Additionally, the game has the same ambiance as the first one without being repetitive, boring, or exhausting. You'll keep wondering about several unanswered questions which aren't answered until halfway or towards the end of the game.DO BUY. DO PLAY. WILL NOT DISAPPOINT			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Labyronia 2 RPG is the sequel of Labyronia RPG. (Obviously, Duh!?)Being inlove with Labyronia RPG, I am excited to play the next story but . . .-They changed the graphics but as time passed by, you will adjust to it. Example, the chest are well blend in the environment. (Who doesn't want easy chest?)-The High-pitch sound. (It makes me cringed, mostly at night.)-The battle scene and effects. (Something is not right. Maybe the status effects?)I have to say that Labyronia RPG is way better. Although, the story of Labyronia 2 is same as awesome as Labyronia RPG!			",14,2,0,2,0,0,0

												This game is set ten years after the first Labyronia. Once more there is a great evil to defeat. This evil has brought legions of ghosts to the land and has frozen it deep in darkness and ice. There are indications that all of that is a result of a ""Great Job Breaking It, Hero!"" from the first game, but... that does happen from time to time in game universes.In this game, you start out at level 20, so... realize how nasty the game will be from that.Also, one of the first companions you meet/gain is the hero from Legend of Mysteria... with all that entails.

												A nifty RPGmaker game, an obvious sequel (including story) to its predecessor. The differences here:-""Cues"" are barely there, still reason to search some objects, but not as chronic as the first game I'd say.-You now buy spells for two of your allies.-The elven forest ""Fountain of Fortune"" gives +1 Luck for 50gp, & can be repeated till hit max of 999 Luck.-There's a ""fourth"" ally of the Warrior class you do get, not SPOILER because the game implies it the entire time.-Seemed like there was less to expore in general, given the nature of the story, only need to get one MANDATORY spell.-Dispel all, is a MANDATORY spell for the Final Boss, make sure you have it.I understand this isn't really a complete review, but I wanted to make sure I pointed out some things that people may've found useful. In general, I bought these games on a whim, I'm glad I did, they're short and sweet. They're not as high quality as ""Last Dream"", but a mostly complete experience nonetheless.

Not gonna lie the font choices were kinda weird (could have selected something more readable, at least for the books) and that beeping noise when you selected something in the menu was irritating to me.But the puzzles were fun, battles also, boss battles have been improved a lot in my opinion. Return of Artemis. If you haven't tried the first one then do so and then get Labyronia 2 all will make so much sense.A hard and challenging game but worth it in the end.			",171,34,5,34,23,2,16

												I love Labyronia 2 !!!! (some spoilers)I just finished Labyronia 1 and started playing Labyronia 2.I loved it.Originally I was worried that L1 characters might be overpowering and less challenging, but I love the design of L2 especially the starting scenario which was carefully thought out to present a sense of challenge.What makes L2 fun was:a. 2 starting characters have no healing spells. This makes it necessary to spend money on rations and make money really precious. It also require some planning to drop by a town to stock up ration, else we will just die.b. The starting characters are challenging because they cannot hurt certain monsters and have to flee from them. This both add a sense of urgency and a need to survive in the game. Wonderfully done.c. Several things add to the challenge. Getting lost running in endless circles without the compass, running from monsters in the dark, etc make the game a lot more fun and time critical.d, I also love the fact that there is no choice of difficulty level, otherwise I would have just played the game on EASY and that would have spoilt the sense of challenge in the game.So developers --- very well done for Labyronia 2 and I would love to immerse my entire weekend in the game. I look forward to providing you more feedback when I finished L2. ",167,234,0,194,31,0,51

												Disclosure: received review copy. This game is a strong contender for my personal favorite for this year on the indie RPG side. And i did not see this coming at all. Now the first game was good but tough. This game is more optimized where it matters the most: encounters(and how to avoid them), storyline and the fact that there is a bit more guidance in the beginning compared to the first game where you are just left into a big open labyrinth world to fend for yourself. Yes there are still those 'oh you just stumbled across a huge boss monster - now you die - reload' -things but they are more unlikely and there actually are sometimes pretty good warnings. As for the mechanics itself i don't want to spend too much time telling about them - it is quite default rpgmaker stuff with the inventory management and combat. It's the labyrinthine world and pretty well designed locations/events that makes this game shine over the first one. It still doesn't hold your hand much but the little more it does is a big improvement in my books. I find myself enjoying this game quite a lot and the more you play it the more addictive it gets. If you are wondering should you buy this or the first one - and you are not that into hardcore JRPG style game then i'd actually recommend this one to go for first. There are references to things in the past it doesn't seem to spoil anything. You might feel lost on the overall story somewhat but i dont see that as too big of a problem.

												It's almost as good as the first game. Definitely harder than the first on some parts. The only thing that bothered me was that the Cue feature is gone, now you just learn spells by leveling, buying them or finding them in chests.			",33,3,0,7,0,0,5

												This second installment in the Labyronia series will be much appreciated by fans new and old. Our story continues where the first game left off, as you begin play as Garric, one of the original heroes of the first game. The world has changed into a wintry nightmare filled with demons and undead, and its up to you and your allies to locate Arres in hopes of finding a solution. The graphics are much improved over the first, and the music is a little tighter as well. Gone are the most frustrating aspect of the game, those darned labrynths - they've been pared down to a more reasonable difficulty. There's plenty of puzzles to be found too and there seems to be a lot less of a need to endlessly grind out levels than there was in the first. One of the things that I appreciated the most was how quickly I found a second party member; who ironically, was the father of the hero of the first game. Fans of the first game will recall that you only found the next member of your party quite close to the end of the story, so locating Windir early on was a relief.I would definitely recommend this game to friends interested in the genre, and have done so. It's so cheap that it's practically a steal, and furthermore, your entire party of heroes are all middle-aged or older, something that you hardly ever see in a game. If you want to save the world and give horrible monsters an elderly smackdown, this is the game for you!Pros+Graphics, sound, and puzzles better than the first game+Continuation of an amazing and original storyline+Fantastic use of a somewhat limited game engine+Geriatric smackdown!Cons+Could have used some better editing			",18,5,0,11,3,0,2

												Fan of RPG and having played the first one, I had to at least play the sequel. The sequel will differ dramatically from the first game in the following ways:1) You get party members early in the game that you can keep (last game gave you party members near the end of the game)2) Everything is dark + bleak to set the story's setting (which I think makes sense for the story plot, but for the player, the very dimmed gameplay just makes it irritating to play - note: later in review I elaborate)3) You don't start off very weak (you aren't at level 1 so you don't have to grind as hard to reach max lvl - 60).4) Slightly more story plot in the sequel than the first (this will only apply if you played the first and then play this, but then again, why would you play the sequel only...)I liked the changes in the sequel, but the dimmed setting can irritate a player. The story's setting has the world of labyronia plunged into a forever winter where monsters run rampant. While the dimmed lighting, purposely darkened screens, and darkened setting serve a purpose in setting the plot, it annoyed me as it was very difficult to distinguish on-screen graphics. Because everything was dark or a shade of black, it is hard to tell if that is a space you can/not walk on in Carralan - irritated me since I had to kept walking back and forth to figure out where I was suppose to go at the beginning. Other times, you just miss things all together because everything looks black-ish, or you are forced to keep walking around in a trial+error fashion. IE: labyrinth mazes are pretty much annoying because you seriously can't see much until you explore + remember the whole place.Another change in the game is the 'cues'. It used to be you learn skill(s) from finding 'cues' but this sequel has removed almost 99% of the skills learned from 'cues'. Ann, to my knowledge, is the only one that still learns skills via interaction with objects. Everyone else learns via leveling or finding/buying manuals. I liked the aspect of finding cues and I do miss this aspect of the game. Truth be told, slightly disappointed that there wasn't a final skill to be learned when you max out the character's level. :( I notice some imbalance of exp + gold per monster. The difficulty ratings of a monster should be correlated to the amount of exp and gold reaped when you slay it. Some monsters do not follow this very well and it can be a very tough time at the beginning of the game where you need some gold to progress + survive better. Improvements from last game:In the first game, there were large stages where you can easily get lost, because the map loops itself. In this sequel, there aren't as many overly large maps that you can wander lost forever now. The stages are still large, but most of them are more constricted. Although, the last section of the game's map was very annoying. I think the next part of the game (Labyronia 3?) will benefit the most if they remove the last bits of maps that are like this.The graphics are similar, but monster sprites look better now. They aren't as pixelated. However, I noticed that in the armagen battles, the battle scenes are delayed or the monster stops attacking me for no reason. Especially in the final boss battle, I entered all the battle commands (IE: defend/attack/etc), but there is a delay before the characters act them out.In the first game, you can get lost as to what to do first, but this game has improved on it where it's mostly linear and it should be clear as to where you are progressing... until you get the airship, which it's up to you to remember where you are in the game. However, it should be clear still and it is a definite improvement from the first.The puzzle aspects of this game are definitely better than the first. It took me awhile to figure out the Hallway of Mirrors and the side quests inserted into the game made it more amusing to play. The puzzles were largely not hard and just makes you feel good about yourself since you can solve them after a little thought. ""Hidden secrets"" in the game. There are just a few of these that I found and those mentioned from others in the discussion page. I wished there was a bit more in developing this area, because everytime I play an RPG and I get free-range of travel (airship/teleportation), my first thought is to travel and find secrets. If you played the first part of this game, then you will mostly know where you want to go to check. Otherwise, you will need to follow a guide to look for some. Although, the current guides don't cover them 100%. Overall, the game is enjoyable and has improved since it's first one, I didn't get as frustrated until I reached stages of the game where shadows and dimmed parts are inserted (aggravation). If there is going to be a labyronia 3, I look forward to trying it and hopefully it keeps all the good parts from Labyronia 1+2 and none of the bad. 8/10! ",52,13,0,4,0,0,1

												Don't bother with this one no matter how cheap it is.You can copy/paste my review of the first one here. It has all the same shortcomings and cliche story.The thing that stands out as worse than the original is that the first 2 areas of the game are filled with ghosts that you cannot hurt. If you find yourself in combat with them you have to take damage for 2 turns until they give you the option to run. And if you aren't paying attention you hit the button to keep fighting and waste 2 more rounds as keep fighting is first in the list. It's the beginning of the game and that is a terrible way to sell it.Do not buy this game.			",245,87,0,51,16,1,14

												""Labyronia RPG 2"" is a very good game, following the story of ""Labyronia RPG"".HIghly recommended for that RPG lovers who remembers with nostalgic feeling the times of the great SNES RPG, in that way, reminds me to ""Chrono Trigger"", in other moments to ""Lufia 2"".Pros:+Good story, cliche story in RPG, but is what we demand from a RPG.+The mazes are very nice, also the dungeons are quite creative, specially the Elves castle is brilliant in the construction.+It's ""Labyronia 1"" but better in most of the aspects. Special mention to some new puzzles in the dungeons.+It's very cheap, and the experience is very satisfaying.+The combat system is much better, and the fight with the bosses are much more interesting, with useful skills, weak section in ""Labyronia 1"", but improved in this sequel.Cons:-It's shorter than ""Labyronia 1"", we find less labyrinths and big areas, also the walkthrough is shorter.-There is nothing outside from the main story, in ""Labyronia 1"" you had more extra bosses to defeat, big bosses in low level areas, that kind of things that make interesting to come back to the initial areas. So, it's a point to improve, the side quests, the extra bosses (big big ones), more areas to discover, etc...-The world map is very similar in every area, it's normal because it's a bleak world, but also in ""Chrono Trigger"" we find  that destroyed areas with more contrasted places. That's why the Elves area is like fresh air for the game.-The designers are very creative, and we want more :)Summarizing, you will not regret buying and playing ""Labyronia 2 RPG"", it's necessary to play the first game to understand the story and to empathize with the characters.Have fun with ""Labyronia 2 RPG"", and we hope to have third part :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hmm...not sure what to say, the new atmosphere is great, but this installment in the series is considerably shorter than the first game, somehow with far more spelling errors littered throughout, the game threw away balance and most monsters give basically the same amount of exp and gold per battle, the first random encounters you run into give like 1800 exp, second to last area has big creatures with far more devastating attacks and hp, making for a tougher and longer battle...and ~3000 exp as a reward. Even the special leveling island returns from the first game but the fights there only give 10,000 exp per fight, there's no incentive not to powerlevel in the vicinity of the first town, as there's no risk and its much quicker.The most annoying part is that you can't clear the last boss battle without having gotten a spell in a chest within some little island's cave, I wandered the world map for over and hour and didn't see it, why do this? Seriously.Considerably worse than the first game, but still interesting for the story, hope future games learn from the mistakes made in this one.			",223,87,1,72,18,3,25

												Now i finish both games and can´t await game Nr. 3. The story is this time even sadder then 1 and i hope 3 comes with a great surprise and can hold up with this 2 titles. The graphic is still fine and looks like nothing is the same. The game time is shorter then in 1, it feels even a bit easier and balanced fights and there are no great passages where you have troubles like 1 was in the first game. So some little weak points are gone. Its still confusing what to do next but some points are better (Aspect of A........ dont kill you) the puzzles are sometimes really tough and need that you read the books (history) and search everywhere for the ability books. So for 10-15 hours fun with smart riddles and finding every hidden weapon/ treature you will get your fun for a little price. Achievements, Trading Card and the continue of a good game. Play both games and you have 20-30 hours of fun and if you have a problem then ask in the Community Hub that is really a friendly/ helpful group that likes this games. Test it with lets plays or demos and support this game please :) i give 9.1 of 10.0 points for 2-D RPG players.			",2539,1137,74,266,297,25,355

												Labyronia RPG 2 is an RPG game with Pokemon-like graphics. Labyronia RPG 2 follows on from the sequel Labyronia RPG 1. This game requires you to be good at exploring and good at RPG Games.Labyronia RPG 2 is set in Labyronia, which was once suppose to be a nice place to live in. Evil creatures and dark ghosts invade this land and feed on fear. Their intention is to wipe out everything that lives and make Labyronia a land of nothingness. So, you start of as a Ranger named Garic (Something like that) in a very small town that you are the boss of. You battle a giant wall crusher and you venture on into the frozen plains and help out each land, whilst finding new accompanies to aid you in your quest. You will soon unlock lots of weapons, armours, helments, trinkets etc... Your main objectives are to get all 3 accomplices, save the Queen and the Sun Emerald, Kill the evil Elven Senate, save the city of Carallan, finish the tournament in the Firelands and fight the end boss and restore peace.This is a great and advanced game to play where you need to learn the boss mechanics. However it does require a lot of patience becuase of unexpected puzzles, mazes, labryinths etc.. Recommended for 15+ Contains some swearing and cursing. The content is extremely hard for kids under the age of 13. Hours of exploring, adventures, puzzles, quests in pokemon style!8.5/10Tadlicated2016 ",96,9,2,7,4,2,15

												Um dos melhores jogos de rpg maker que já joguei.Pontos positivos:- Boa jogabilidade;- Enredo interessante;- Gráficos bacanas;- Trilha sonora muito bem feita;- Ampla diversidade de skills, buffs e magias (bem como suas combinações).O único ponto negativo é que você joga majoritariamente com classes mágicas, exceto pelo Garic, que é arqueiro. Deveriam botar umas classes diferentes.Recomendo fortemente aos que gostam do gênero e do estilo.9,5/10.			",78,11,3,5,1,0,4

												Not a bad RPG. I feel like it could use some work but from I have read it is an improvement from the first Labyronia. So, the developers are trying. A good sign!The game controls are OK. Some slight movement issues due to the engagement of walking/sprinting features that don't seem to mesh well. It needs an ""option"" selection in the launch window. There are no audio/video controls.Besides a few lacking things the game is decent enough and is worth the price. I did a quick run to demonstrate a few aspects of the game (like combat), check out the video!

												The Labyronia story continues! With the story line picking up 10 years after the last game you play as Ann, Windir,Ronnie and Goric to defeat Armegen the father of evil himself! The world of Labyronia has turned into darkeness and a never ending winter .Its up to your party to save the world. With RPG goodness of the Final Fantasy classic game, this game is fun and like its prequal, a challanging one. Mazes and puzzles abound, this game will test your patience and memory for sure. With much the same as the first game there is alot of polish and still runs smoothly and has a more in depth story to what you would think from an RPG maker game. The only thing negative about this game is the language is mature and can be offensive. Cursing and such is with in the game and may not be suitable for the younger crowd.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												Labyronia RPG 2 Review – Raymond KTI’ll spoil my whole review for you; don't bother with this one no matter how cheap it is. You can copy/paste my review of the first one here. It has all the same shortcomings and cliche story. The thing that stands out as worse than the original is that the first 2 areas of the game are filled with ghosts that you cannot hurt. If you find yourself in combat with them you have to take damage for 2 turns until they give you the option to run. And if you aren't paying attention you hit the button to keep fighting and waste 2 more rounds as keep fighting is first in the list. It's the beginning of the game and that is a terrible way to sell it. ",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

												Just by playing 6 minutes I can write this kind of a review:PROS:-The game is cheap-The game has pretty good controls-Fluent gameplay-A long game (compared to its price this game can offer a lot of entertainment)CONS:-No settings menuEDIT: Well turns out there is a way to change settings. I'll quote Labyrinthine's comment here:""You can launch fullscreen by pressing alt-enter, or additionally meddle with the screen sizes with F5/F6. There is also a settings menu if you press F1, although this is directly engine-provided and not exactly customized for the game menus.""Points: 8/10I like the fact that the game is cheap and offers a lot of things for that low price tag, but the settings menu not being there is a big downside. But now that I heard about the things that I can change settings with, I can add up some points there :)			",58,5,1,3,1,2,3

I thought the first was bad, this one is worse.The starting area has unkillable enemies you can not run away from immediately, you have to wait for a prompt to run away, all the while the mobs are killing you.At least the maps have actual walls now and you won't keep looping around trying to find a cue or the NPC you need to speak with to advance the story.

												Started the game. Only keys i could use were x, z, enter and the arrow keys. Woke up as some old man. Found a bow and a helmet in a chest, after talking to a lady in just blue clothes. Walked outside to find a huge demon monster from the 7th sircle of hell bashing down the wall of the town i was in. Started speaking to the guy nearest the huge thing. We started fighting it, the thing with 8 horns and probably the weight of around 30 busses. After 4 hits back and forth my buddy died. After 2 more turns I allso died. Game over, back to the menu screen. GG well played. 10/10 would fight the spawn of satan again ",94,16,1,17,15,0,8

												This game is worse than Labyronia 1, which I wasn't a big fan of, but was at least playable until I got frustrated by the unnecessary water spouts.  This game starts out with a meeting at a tower that you can't go in without a lantern.  You know what, I am not going to hunt the world for a lantern.  If I'm supposed to meet a guy at a tower that requires a lantern, he should either have it or tell me where to get it.  Screw this game.  It is literaly not worth buying on sale for the free card drops.			",30,5,0,10,4,0,7

												Not sure why there are so many positive reviews early on, but here's my two cents. Not a bad RPG, but there are two design flaws that stopped me over 2 hours into this game:-Lack of detail for mission progression: In other words, I saved game, and the next day I forgot what I even needed to do. It was obscure. Going back to important characters did not contain the dialogue to direct me in the right direction. I luckily succeeded by chance and progressed. Story is very confusing and not direct.-Puzzle Mechanism: I could not get out of some puzzles, requiring a full restart. This is a problem, since one of the times I had a lot of progress that went unsaved. Not recommended, when I compare it to the likes of Last Dream.			",59,9,1,2,0,0,2

												I got this game, the first labyronia and a 3rd game in a bundle for $.75 and i can only hope that i get more then $.30 on it the last game to get my money back from cards. The first game was awful and i didn't see this game being any better after the first mob you fight killed one of the two party members(who then doesn't even join you) and left me with 4 out of like 400 health and no way to heal. i spent maybe 20 mins on it before giving up; 5 mins was listening to the baddly written prolog and dialog, 5mins fighting that thing, and the rest searching for something to heal me. As the it seemed like it was going to have the same flaws as the first and didn't want to even deal with it and left it on to get the cards over night. I regret that these are the first RPGmaker games ive played as i most likely wont try them again unless i find a bundle with cards again thats cheap as ♥♥♥♥.DO NOT BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥it is poor made in every sense of a game other then i didn't run into 'bugs' in the short time i 'played' ",140,29,2,13,8,3,14

												A sequel of Labyronia RPG. The game is easier to finish compared to the prequel but still has the same playstyle and a great story.			",100,14,2,4,2,1,5

												Not nearly as good as the first, but a fine game until you reach an area with rolling rocks. The developers wanted to ensure hundreds of cheap deaths and an equal number of negative reviews. The concept of the room is fine, and even neglecting to put a save point nearby is fine, but the controls are not nearly responsive enough to make it a challenge of skill. The characters simply do not move that quickly or accurately. The product is faulty. A full refund would not even be sufficient, because you've fraudulently induced me into purchasing this game, and the time I wasted is gone forever.			",102,50,1,18,9,1,11

												Loved the first one and I love this one to!Pros:-storyline is good here to-for th one who like it the story is a little shorter on this one-not to grind heavy this time-still got lovable charecters, more flesh out charecters this time!-Clears up some stuff and brings closer to some thingsCons:-somewhat short (but it's done well so this is not too bad)-Not that big of a map to explore this time around :(Personal comments:    I kind of wanted Ann and Arres to get a happy ending but the story seemed odd in a way, can't explain it. It kinda made it so that it could contenue but than again not...it was weird. I hope that maby Ann and Arres got taken to the fifth mistery dimension if Arres lived somehow as he was not per say destroyed. and they lived in a light and shadow world kinda place of a balanced Ely and other diety element. I just feel Ann and Arres could have been touched on more. anyways over all the game was amazing to play regardless awesome job!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm mixed with this game. Spent a few hours wandering trying to remember and figure out what I had to do. Saw videos online to show me how to find the Armagen's and saw that someone else was at level 30 for Garic Yet I was level 46.Going up levels don't seem to really help in your damage. Almost anybody towards the end needed Light Bath to actually be able to do any significant damage. Did not know how to do some puzzle parts and had to look it up. I REALLY did not like the second puzzle at the end where you looked at mirrors. I could not put the titles and pictures together. Had to do trial and error. I think that took me over an hour. Which is *SPOILER - from left to right 1,7,8,6,2,5,4,3 *SPOILER.But in the end, Once I caught onto the battle sequence, it wasn't too hard. I got some enjoyment out of it. But I think there are more things annoying/strange about it than there was good. (areas of the map where no battles occur? Able to land your airship where you're not suppose to go. Etc...) I'm giving it 4.5/10			",16,43,0,24,0,0,1

												Pretty good jrpg alike considering the price of the game. Improvement in every aspect of the game compared to the first title. This game is a soft version of classic Jrpgs such as FF and Dragon Quest.+ Smooth Music+ Variety of Enemies+ A little Grindy (it wont spoil the gameplay)+ Nice maze design (with darkness)+ Much improved questing and sense of direction compared to the first game- The story is a bit off (It is a weak story, but this is what you can expect for this price and RPGmaker games)- High pitch sound for menu selection is never recommended- Very high exp monsters appear in early stages of the game making it way too easy to level beyond your calculated level(might be a pro for some)Overall a pleasant game, consider it a weak version of Final Fantasy, Chrono or Dragon Quest games.
