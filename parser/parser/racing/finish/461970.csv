												Almost unplayable. It's shallow, simplistic, your car controls like a goat on roller skates and the frame rate is an embarrassment. I beat the first level (eventually), but the experience was simply so un-fun that after persisting with the second level for a few minutes I decided that enough was enough and just hit alt-F4. The game's free and I STILL want my money back!			",279,119,1,76,20,3,77

												Explore a desolate environment and build the road on the go in this exciting racing gameAlthough you might assume there’s not much left to innovate when it comes to racing games, the truth is that there’s always something one change, not to mention all the things that can be added. Not just that, but genre mixing is quite popular as well, which opens up an even larger palette of possibilities when it comes to gameplay mechanics.Build the road ahead one piece at a timeSkyreach is not your typical racing game, but it’s not exactly a revelation in the genre either. In short, the main idea is that you are free to build the track as you go along, making it more of an exploration game than anything else. Unfortunately, it has a few flaws that make the experience a tad too annoying to be enjoyable, especially if you go in expecting speed and actual driving.To begin with, the action takes place in some kind of great desert, although you are actually racing between floating islands. The fact that there’s no ground means that you have to place each piece of the track as you go, otherwise you fall to your death. If this sounds anticlimactic and slow, it’s because it is. Hence, you’re usually moving along at a snail’s place, partly because it’s difficult to maintain speed and build the track, and partly because the game takes forever to place the said track pieces anyway.Over-sensitive controls and decent graphicsYou also have to deal with the poorly optimized controls, given the fact that the vehicle oversteers at the slightest touch, making it incredibly frustrating to negotiate corners at slightly higher speeds. Thankfully, at least you can use a controller to have a better grip on the situation, but that only makes it better than with a keyboard, not better in general. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that controls are important in a racing game.Things are much better in the graphics department, and it’s obvious that the designers put some soul into the environments and the game world in general. The desolate landscapes can be quite moody and engaging, even if you’ll barely get the chance to admire them while you build the track. The graphics quality is decent as well, although there are some performance issues that shouldn’t be there.A great concept that needs a lot of workAll things considered, Skyreach is certainly something new, and it’s only natural that it didn’t come out perfect the first time around. However, something has to change as quickly as possible, because right now the game is not able to keep players happy for more than a few minutes.With out a few updates this game is unplayable. As of now i cannot recommend the game in its current state at all. If you want a racing game look elsewhere cause you wont find it in Skyreach. ",189,44,1,46,12,1,12

												An awful experience.  A dreadfully awful experience.Is this game free?  Yes.Does this game have achievements?  Yes.Are all the negative reviews accurate?  Yes.Does this game have awful framerate on most machines?  Yes.Does this game require you to manually edit the game\'s registry just so it can run smoothly?  Yes.Is this fix temporary to where it will still lag?  Yes.Are the controls over sensitive?  Yes.Is this a racing game with a narrow road?  Yes.Will the music get annoying?  Yes.Is the environment an uninspired and frustrating wasteland? Yes.Should you avoid this game?  Yes.Is this game Skyreach?  Yes.Hope this answers all your concerns...by the way, you only have 3 levels, but get an achievement for ""All stages complete"" for beating the first two.  Do you really want an easy 100%?  Hope you're up to digging into your registry.  This is obviously a student project that is meant to attempt being innovative, yet p*ss off its own players.0.5/10  Skyreach?  More like Rectalreach.

""Build your roads interactively during you race them""Quite a nice game concept for a little indie F2P game. It's challenging and mean. No way of map planning before you play. Just trial and error. Sometimes I think the clunky controls are intended and you die of falling rocks and columns, crashing into walls and steering into the abyss too easy. You are in somekind of ancient gods cloudworld and try to race with a futuristic vehicle throught many obstacles over buildup roads by your own. Collect the gemsacks to gain a few seconds time back to finally reach the goal. The graphics are ugly and truely not adjustable. The Unity 3D engine is laggy as hell if you aren't using a super gaming PC. Nice adventure soundtrack. Might be nervy over time. But really challenging. Indeed.			",1637,665,58,135,164,17,216

												I would say my review is similar to others. The game is jittery and I have only really spent time playing during June so it is the current version available. The controls are iffy and trying to build the road is questionable there are times when it just won't let me build so I have to drive backward and forward until it recognizes my car is there. Which with a timed course does not work out.The concept seemed interesting which is why I tried it but the overall execution fails.			",33,2,1,1,2,0,1

												This game has a lot of promise, but has some issues. I will say this, the concept is good, the music is pretty good, and the progression is good as well. I program but I haven't done any thing with graphics so I have to idea how that works, but the game was very jittery which was the big killer for me. I also found the controls the be a bit sensitive, I also found it difficult to build the track I don't know if my controller just decided to not work properly (which I dought, but who knows) or what.In short, the only reason I gave this game a negitive review is because in it's current state the game is nearly unbarable to play, and if it were possible to give a mixed review I would have.

												Fantastic premise!I love that it is trying to do something with racing other than more licensed cars.Well done!In reality though, the racing part of this is very dull because there really isnt enough time to be steering and building so to beat the levels, you have to go slow.The track pieces need to be a little longer I think, keep the shorter pieces for harder levels.

												Ok, not the type of game I would normally play - but its a nice change of pace. It reminds me of the old game ""Pitfall"" mixed with ""Mario Kart"" - only its just you a blank canvas and a race against the clock.  Its worth a play if you enjoy casual games with a race against the clock element. The game in its current state has you driving your ancient bone car thingy and summoning your own path from point A (start) to point B (finish) however, you are able choose how you get from A to B via a simple selection of path summons Left turn, Straight, and Right Turn. There are green crystals that you must collect along the way to increase your time left alive by +5 seconds - from there its simply a creative race against the clock to get from start to finish. All in all its not my cup of tea but I thougth I would try it out since its new, FTP, and no reviews are currently given. I cant say that there was anything about the game I really didnt like, but as I already stated its not my cup of tea so I think if you have 10-15 mins your bored and doing nothing give it a play though - you may just very well love this game.

												Skyreach is a free game that you are racing against the clock in a bone buggy while building the road and seeing the path to the endpoint.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played badly, sounded ok.  Interesting concept but Needs a lot more work.  It works with keyboard.  CONS:- Laggy on all visual qualities.  - It said it works using a xbox 360 controller but it didn't work with my xbox controller, i tried other controller, didn't work.- Keyboard works but there are no instructions for keyboard.  - Game is too hard to play at level 1.  - Hard to do three different things at the same time, Driving at speed, seeing the path to take, and making the path.- There is ONLY 3 levels.- Level 2 is extremely hard with the absence of path guide.- You will have to restart many times to figure out the path and the order of path building.Try it and delete it.For more info:

WARNING: This is not a racing game at all! Don't come into this expecting racing gameplay-like features.What this game is: You drive around a scene, trying to collect green crystals that give you the time needed to reach the end of the scene. But the path you drive on is created by you, section by section, as you go (you choose between a left turn, a right turn, and a straight ahead path). It's like an ""exploratory race against time"", except you're only racing against the clock.It feels and plays like an early stage indie game. There are some good ideas for a game here, and I did enjoy it, even if it was not a great overall experience. That said, the game is free, so I think everyone should give it a go.PROS Free Refreshing concept Nice art-styleCONS Very short (3 stages only) Awkward controls ",42,23,2,8,10,0,5

												You could call this ""game"" is a puzzle racer.  Not a combo you see much of...and now we know why.   YES: Original car design Original game concept Free  NO: Bad/slow controls Bland level design Bad overview/ perspective    Conclusion: I could not really call it a game, it felt more like a proof of concept. The game idea is very simple race your ""wheely thing"", and during the race you build the track you are driving on.  But the timed race and building of the track don’t mix. Sometimes you had no idea where to go, and when you placed the track, more then often it was placed in or against a wall before you noticed it. And so you fell off the track or tried to fix the mistake and would fall off in reverse... Did I mention the track is floating?  The controls felt unresponsive, and every time you think about racing fast, the lane did not keep up or you found yourself head first in to a wall.   			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting concept.  Nice artwork/style.But... quite slow, and not much fun.... but with a lot of potential.  I found myself having to slow down and wait to 'draw' the next track piece.  If my mind is 2 or 3 pieces ahead, I wanted to draw them and drive them quickly, but I couldn't. Dying because I didn't make it to the next gem in time, caused frustration, not the need to replay.   I wanted to keep drawing track and trying to make it to the gem... after a few rounds, then I could trying to find the optimum route... but, nope... don't get it right... game over.I also wanted the ability to build the track up and down, not just left, right, forward.  Just my 2 cents.  At this point, fun to try for free.  Possibly quite a good and interesting driving puzzle game with some work.  For now though, I can't recommend.   ",673,227,65,78,77,9,89

												It's a pretty bad game.I believe its main issue centers around the core game mechanic, with you being a car and forced to construct the road before you, meaning you can only move a about a snail's pace which completely negates the purpose of driving a vehicle at all.That combined with occasional physics bugs and a timer made this a boring experience, and I have no reservation in saying that it was a waste of time. I just couldn't care enough about the game to get frustrated with it.			",234,47,7,18,24,2,27

Pros :-Free.-Full controller support (not that I have a working one).-Interesting idea for the game. And I like racing games in genral (not that I play many of them).Cons :-Short.-The soundtrack seems nice at first but after a while your ears start bleeding so save yourself the misery and mute the game before you start playing.-My PC is♥♥♥♥♥♥and even so it has double the minimum required RAM and the processor is better than the required one. Having said that it was still laggy as ♥♥♥♥ and was barely playable.-Sometimes I would press a button to build a road but nothing would happen. Actually something would happen - me dying because a road wasn't build...-There were times when I pressed a button to build a road after my car has been runing in thin air for at least 1 second...-I touched the ground after ""falling"" from half a meter resulting in my car being in pieces, yet a real fall from 10+ meters didn't break it. It just simply disappeared in thin air. Magic!-""Rainbow Goat"" achievement which requires one to collect 50 crystals without dying unlocked after I completed the first level and I died many times while not collecting 50 crystals...-""Sky Reached"" achievement requires one to complete all levels which are three, yet in the description when I was at 0 it said 0/2. That's right, it unlocked after completing level two.Conclusion :Avoid at all cost! Only If you want some achievements and an easy 100% game I can recommend it. I've played crappy games but this is in my top 3. Even if it's free I am still requesting a refund. No/10			",661,288,14,45,72,10,91

												I got the achievement for 'collecting 50 crystals without dying' when I collected about a total of 10 crystals. We already have over sensitive controls and lag as the main issues with the game... now let's add that the achievements don't work right.If the developer fixed the controls and lag, I would willing to give it another chance. As it stands currently, I can't recommend it.			",79,27,3,16,9,0,11

												Interesting concept. Would be better if it wasn't about beating the clock, but rather focused on the exploration element. You should be able to build paths any which way and really explore the terrain. Bad control of car. Really bad frame rate lag. As a game I can't recommend. Good for a free demo.

												Original type of game, that mix Trackmania with puzzle stuff.It's so basic game without anything special, but if you're looking for some 15minutes (literally 15minutes) game, that aren't so common, there you go.Imo it should be a little bit harder and longer, coz it has potential, but it definitely lacks of challenges and amount of levels.+ add car skins, ♥♥♥♥♥es love skins in games ;]			",239,63,17,17,22,6,33

												Skyreach is a nice little unity game, that plays and feels like a student game. Unfortunately, its coming from a studio that is supposed to be professional by now. The good original idea ( building the track you race on as you go ) does not make up for  the lack of good feedback,instateneous deaths, poor graphics ( is this really unity on fantastic mode ?) and frustrating level design. This feels like a first playtest in a second year of school. Too bad, since it's an okay concept.			",132,17,3,11,3,0,12

												Skyreach,in short, nice concept, not so biljant excution.What is it what I don't like about this game?Well, it's the controls and the presentation. In my opinion the controls are not precise enough and the way things are presented gives me the feeling that it's just some hobby project.Basically, that's okay if it wasn't for the many strange crashes that I get or the absence of any hints if needed.Might be just me, but I'm not a sucker for this kind of game.
