												This is the best speedway game i ever played also i would be happy if another gaming company makes a sprint car game which is better because not much sprint car games are out and not much company makes them. ",45,2,3,1,5,0,2

												I personally love dirt track racing and try to watch as often as my local track run. Sprint Cars Road to Knoxville is a great game IF you love dirt track racing. The game is very specific to dirt track fans, and while not perfect, is the best one that is still readily available. Although to be frank, some playstation 2 models were indeed better games but are harder to get ahold of now. If you cannot race with a keyboard, I wouldn't bother because some seem not to work. The car sound can occasionally be garbled, and sounds bad but isn't detrimental to the gameplay itself. Also, I've seen many gripe about creating drivers taking forever. You don't have to, as long as your driving you can hire the cheapest driver and get to work. If you love dirt track racing, I think you'll find this game soothing enough to eat up some of your day.Good luck and hope this was helpful.			",2,0,2,1,5,0,0

												Hmmm... I don't know... I played a little bit and it's missing something... Some ""wow"" factor... This is a situation where the ""maybe"" button would come in handy.			",1469,420,125,86,261,22,172

												This game is absolute junk.  Impossible to set up a controller and overall very glitchy.  I wasn't looking for much, and despite that it disappoints.			",14,0,0,4,3,0,2
