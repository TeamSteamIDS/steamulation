												The graphics haven't aged particularly well and the handling is pretty arcadey by todays standards - BUT the game is a massive amount of fun and has a ton of tracks, I would easily recommend this to off-road racing fans.Also worth noting: The game picked up my 360 controller fine and you can rebind all the buttons - including triggers, which is great.

												I would reccomend this, the amount of mods and custom tracks/ramps/objects/mods/skins/tricks are not something you can quantify and it is still a fun game to play, has an easy to use track editor in it to make creating your own track something anyone can do, and also has a sort of nostalgia factor.  10/10.

												This game is just as great as I remember it being on the ps2. For anyone who wants this game because you enjoyed it years past I'd strongly suggest adding this game to your library.Something that wasn't on the ps2 is the track editor and I must say that I love the track editor aswell. I'd just like to add that It might have a steep learning curve for some who aren't experienced with the work environment of such software.Nominated for the “Test of Time” Award.

												This game gives me a real nostalgic feel and i loved it on the ps2 but sadly on pc it has a tendancy to crash. it will work but you will have to try over and over again. at least thats what happened to me. It may work with stronger computers  but not with mine. the game runs at a steady 30 fps which isnt so bad for a 2006 game but it can still lag out. I recommend the game but maybe for slightly better performing computers than my 300 dollar laptop.			",42,2,2,8,1,0,2

												It's still a good game and fun to play. I played it on the play station, and now on the PC. The track maker program is fun to use, wish you could make a bigger track, instead of this simple small track. What I did not like about it is the bikes that rep yamaha looking bikes and KTM looking bikes had been pulled. Leaving the Honda, Suzuki, and Kawisaki looking bikes besides what Rainbow and THQ bikes. I personally am a Yamaha rider in real life, so this bikeing being pulled from the PC version of the game really blows. But getting pass that, the game is still a fun game to play.

												Remember ordering a really cool looking game from a Scholastic Book Order back in school? Well, this game was one the gems I bought in third grade. The title is misleading because you can also drive golfcarts, dune buggies, and even fly planes or helicopters. It still has that same mid-2000s charm! The stadium crowds still punch the stuffing outta each other.I got this for 50% off and love it! Even though I played this as a kid, I wouldn't have bought it at full price considering today's pricing and competition. Runs fine on Windows 10 and doesn't need a CD/password for installation like the old-days.			",166,53,4,11,11,0,6

												Before you look at my hours, I would like you to know that I haven't played this game ever. Not on PS2, Xbox, whatever. However, I did play MX Unleashed when I was a kid, so therefore, I think I can review this game.MX vs. ATV Unleashed is a great racing and freestyle game. Sure, you can play its races, but I barely knew anybody who did that. You know what I mean. All I do is goof off in Free Ride and freestyle. Now, let me talk about the main complaints, which I am going to defend.1. This game doesn't work! A: I know it doesn't always work. In fact, if you have Intel HD graphics, it won't work at all. However, here is how to fix it. Just launch the game and don't change any resolution, graphics, or texture settings. It's that simple. You can change the controls (Like I did because the default controls aren't good) and no crashes. 2. OMG! 30 FPS LOCK?!?!? A: Yes, there is a 30 FPS lock. However, it doesn't affect how the game works. It's not like me where if it happened in an intense, precision game, where you need to instantly make decisions. Plus, this game is almost 10 years old. 60 FPS wasn't always the common things for games. Those were complaints I saw most. I do complain that there is no open world like MX Unleashed. If there was, I would love this game to death. But even still, I still can't hate this game.I would give this a 8/10. Just buy it now. And if you can't fix it, look on forums and then refund it.

												While this isnt the best racing game you will find on PC, MX Vs. Atv is still a very fun game.Graphics: For a 2006 game, I guess it's average. The tracks look good, and so are the models of the vehicles. I also like the graphical style of the menu. It's nothing special, but I personally like it.Sound: There's quite a lot of songs that were good at the time. If you played this game back in the day, like me, you will feel very nostalgic to hear the in-game music. Though, nowadays, it's nothing to be very excited about, in my opinion.Controls: They're good. But I don't really have much to say about it. You controls the vehicles with the arrow keys, like many other racing games on PC. For the MX and ATVs, there are a few buttons you can press while pressing a direction with the arrows to perform stunts in mid-air. It works very well.Gameplay: This is what the game is best at. You have a lot of choices in vehicles. You would think you get Motos and Quads, but no! You get a few flying vehicles, dune buggies, trophy trucks, golf carts, sand rails, and even Monster Trucks! There are some missions to complete to keep you busy. You can do races, or course. But what I love is the Free Ride mode. You basically just do whatever you want in this mode. And that's what I love to do in this game. And if you are tired of the base tracks, you can even make your very own tracks! And making tracks is easy as well ! The physics aren't the most realistic you could get, but still, they're acceptable. But though, why would you mind the realism of the physics if the game is fun? You'd rather play a fun game with non-realistic physics than a boring game with realistic physics.My only complaint is that since you can easily make levels, it would be awesome to have workshop support for the game, so that you can easily share tracks. But nope! There is, sadly, no workshop support. Overall, this is a good racing game. Or course, there are better alternatives, but if you have a budget computer, this is a game for you. Reccomended!			",445,57,47,23,36,6,23

												Let me keep this short, I love the game. I've played it when I was younger and I still do love it as of today. However, when I bought it for the PC, I was expecting it to feel like the good old days on the PS2, it was not like that.. at all. I would be ashamed to refund the game as I did not buy the game for myself, one of my family members did it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, however, there are a lot of errors to it. It works great for me, no crashes what so ever but you have to configure the controls and it's just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to do for that reason I will not recommend the game to anyone who would like to buy this game on the PC, play it on the PS2 like the good old days.

												Well I'm so happy now that Steam has opened the door to older but still very fun games. Games now are so AAA mainstream and have to have the best graphics and a huge open world. But many forget games like this are what built the foundation for today's AAA titles. These games are classics in my mind and to their true fans they think the same. This game is a 10/10 Easy. The best out of the series although ""Untamed"" has far more content and things to do. Cheap, simple, fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Coming at this as being my first foray into the MX vs. ATV series, I have to say that I find this game a mixed bag.The game isn't bad. For a game from 2006 it's actually pretty decent, if nothing impressive visually. Controls work well with a 360 controller and even support both joysticks for camera rotation, something that older pre-Xinput games didn't always do, and the racing mechanics are solid enough.All that said, even in 2006 there were better games you could have been spending your money on. The game looks and feels like a budget title even for the time, with the licensed soundtrack being the title's real high point. The AI rubber bands like nobody's business, a feature racing games still have a problem with, and the lack of real impact your bike or ATV has on the course makes for a game that just doesn't feel great to play. Combined with limited graphical and gameplay tuning options and you have an experienced that is easily surpassed by any number of titles both on and off Steam.The price point isn't terrible, but feels like it is somewhat more than the game deserves given its limitations and the game's overall forgettable nature. On the plus side, the game runs fine first-boot on Windows 8.1 with a full suite of modern hardware, so if you do decide to take the plunge there is little in the way of configuration needed to get it to run, though widescreen support would have been nice to see.Recommended, but only for the fact that those with some sense of nostalgia for it shouldn't be disappointed by this version or its ability to run. For newcomers, though? Look elsewhere.			",619,177,13,85,47,7,83

												So much nastalgia. The game runs smooth as can be on windows 10. I've heard it doesn't work in windows 8 or 8.1. Not sure though. In order to use a controller you have to remap all of the controls; not that big of a deal, just annoying to do. Screen resolution is low as well. I think 1280 x 1024 is the max. It's not that big of a deal. Still the game I remember it to be. SO much fun.			",108,8,7,1,6,0,10

												Really good to play an old game I grew up on! Back when games were just games and as a kid you didn't care about graphics all you wanted to do was have fun. The one downside of course is that I wish it had controller support other than that great game for being made in '06.			",166,11,3,13,6,1,2

												Well I'm so happy now that Steam has opened the door to older but still very fun games. Games now are so AAA mainstream and have to have the best graphics and a huge open world. But many forget games like this are what built the foundation for today's AAA titles. These games are classics in my mind and to their true fans they think the same. This game is a 10/10 Easy. The best out of the series although ""Untamed"" has far more content and things to do. Cheap, simple, fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game since 2006. Nostalgic, even. Stock controls are funky, but I ended up making my own. Great game to do some moto on PC. The soundtrack is also very early-mid 2000s, too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
