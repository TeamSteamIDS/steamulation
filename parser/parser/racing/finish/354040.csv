												The title already did the explanation for this game.You are controlling a Hypership that is out of control. (Yep you read it right, controlling something that is out of control.)I can't say this game is in a category of Shoot 'Em Up since it doesn't really require you to shoot things. (There are many undestructable object).Your job is to evade all the objects and make your way throughout the waves.The game itself is fast paced. you start with a normal speed and the speed will keep on increasing every seconds.It will only dropped if you're dead.Considering the price, it's also not a bad game for a quick entertainment.

												This is a fun little shmup that has a nice twist to it in that you don't have any enemies firing at you. Instead, you're dodging obstacles that come at you faster and faster the longer you go without dying. Collecting coins gives you points and increases your point multiplier and there are a number of different power ups to help you get through the increasingly difficult areas. It's simple in terms of visual design, but it works for this sort of game. The music and sound effects are similarly workable if not spectacular. There are a few different game types, which add a little bit to the replayability, but it's otherwise a pretty light game in terms of content. There are no real unlocks or reasons to play over and over except to improve your scores. Thankfully it's a light game that is fun to come to for 10-15 minutes. One thing I don't like is some of the ""attitude"" in the menus, which insult you if you're quitting the game or restarting the game. It's amusing exactly once and then just becomes annoying.

												Really simple graphics, really simple (but nice) music, really simple idea and really simple gameplay.And yet this game is really simple...simply brilliant!How? No idea, but whenever I have few minutes to spare, I play this game. Give it a chance, don't let small price and simplicity fool you. :)			",633,181,20,104,58,6,120

												'Fun Infused Games' delivers just what it says on the label. A very simple, very fun game with tight controls and a charming aesthetic.  They've done a good job with the trailer and screenshots - what you see is what you get.This is probably the first shmup I've played in which the levels can be snarky.Absolutely worth the tiny full price.  Controls wonderfully with a gamepad. ",1893,882,66,285,274,23,336

												This game is really fun, but the Left/Right keys move you too far over making it hard to manoeuvre in tight spaces (which there are plety of. Enjoy the explosions, they're like fireworks, and the energetic music. Might control better with a controller!			",196,140,4,31,16,3,42

 Beta Review This game is nice & quick. Nothing much else to say about it. Play for hours on end, trying to beat your previous score every time, or play for a few minutes while waiting for the cab. You will die alot. that much is certain.			",63,28,0,12,6,3,6

												There are really only two things you need to know about Hyper Ship Out Of Control. Firstly, it’s brilliant for the 80 points that it will cost you, and secondly, you will not be able to complete it. Ever. Overall rating 6/10.
