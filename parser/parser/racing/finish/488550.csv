								Very good game, and the developer is constantly working on it (unlike, it seems, many other early-access games). It's great for anyone who's been into those bridge building games, or physics based games, or even just racing/off road car games.Pros:- Virtually bug free, which is fantastic for early-access.- Excellent physics modelling; everything behaves how you should expect it to, and behaves accurately.- Best integration with the Steam Workshop that I've seen in-game. Already a lot of user-made creations.- Custom maps available, though the standard map has a lot of different terrain to get you going.- Level of ""OCD"" is up to you; you can build a car pretty quick (or customize a default or steam Workshop car) and get racing, or spend hours tweaking every little aspect and getting things just right to shave a second or two off your laps.- Very familiar GUI/controls to anybody who has used a CAD program before. 3-window modelling space is a great idea and works very well to let you see what you're doing.Cons:- Graphics could be better. Based on my framerates, this game could increase its textures and add some better shaders without being a hinderance to even mid-level PCs.- GUI needs an update; the menus and buttons look a bit like an old Windows 95 strategy game or something.- No controller support (YET. This is on the Dev's ToDo list, so check the details and discussions to see if it's been implemented when you read this if controller support is a must-have). Having said that, due to the nature of the off-road racing, the keyboard isn't nearly as annoying to use as a road racing game for the time being.			",73,18,8,6,14,1,6

								This a great game, although I know some things that could only make it greater. Now, if you were going for a simple, realistic car building/ testing game, then you've done well.But here is a list of 5 things that would only make the game better.1) WaterMake the abilty for there to be randomly generated water on the default maps. This could be seen as oceans, lakes, streames, ponds, or even rivers(be even cooler if the water flowed, and moved your car). You would also want there to be the point where if you get water into your intake (more on that in a second) then your car would die. Lastly, you would want to make optional, for the people whose computers may have trouble running too much.2) IntakeAnother idea is intakes. They are quite simple. They bring in the air for the engine. One thing you could also do, is make it  so that, depending where they are placed, they can get better air flow.3) ExaustYou could tune it, make it louder, or just cut it off. This would really just be for fun.4) Defomable GroundYou could add some sort of vairable texture, or something, where as the ground could move out from under you. You could also add mud with the water update (if you made that a thing). It would be cool to have something where you were driving through mud, then you spun out, and gou stuck. you could also add diffrent ground textures to go with this. You could work on the sand, add gravel , mud, and other stuff too, like tall grass.5) WinchThe last thing that I would like to include is a winch. I wouldn't care about this one as much the other things, but some other people might.That just about wraps it up. Although lastly I would like to add that you could also add trees, and bushes, and other stuff.			",12,1,1,3,2,0,1

								1) Yes I've noticed bugs but I've already reported them to you and the ones I have seen have been fixed already2) Most things are clear in the game but I would recommend adding video support in-game so you can post tutorials on how to make something like a working suspension, instead of prebuilt saves you can load.3) I love this game and have not gotten bored of it mostly because I am usually in sandbox, although I still enjoy single player.4) I like single player but I think it needs work and some refinement, for example you need to add some racing maps in, add tracks, and when you can publish the best map or track someone has made into single player.5) My opinion about sandbox is that it is amazing and that I love how you can post tracks in-game for other people to try out and it's fun to be able to build what ever you want and just mess around and enjoy it.6) My opinion of the game is 4 out of 5 stars because of how great of a game this is and how you can build what ever you want and their is almost no limit to what you can build. The reason I didn't give this game a higher rating is because it still needs work and it still has those few ideas and details that would make this game ever better, I enjoyed this game and can't wait to see what becomes of it in the future			",14,3,1,1,5,0,1

								If you like physics games, this is a very good physics game! The physics engine has a very realistic feel and it is smooth as well. If you're like me and you like cars, engines and mechanical engineering concepts, you'll probably enjoy this game as much as I have been. I tend to spend hours on one vehicle, tweaking suspension, frame size/weight/length/width, tires until it is just right. This game makes that kind of gameplay available. Where this game really shines for me is the suspension. I can't believe how amazing it looks and feels while going over bumps and taking sharp turns. The possibilities of suspensions you can make seem endless, and you're not even limited to just the shocks that are a provided part. You can even use frame parts with elasticity tweaks and come up with your own suspension designs, as you may see when checking out the workshop (which has many, awesome designs).I personally don't like shallow and arcade-style physics games that invovles vehicles. This one is the opposite. Now for some reality: It is early access. The game does feel a little empty after a while. A big one for many - it is not multiplayer. Not a big deal for me really but I know some may not prefer that.But, jets were just added! So one good thing about this game is that it is not done with additional content. So with that in mind, this is a good time waster. I'd say it's well worth the time I've put into it. Overall I give this game a thumbs up! For the price, it's definitely a good deal and plenty of enjoyment. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a Sandbox car building game where you literally control every aspect of the car. That being said it is not easy, and if you're not up for a challenge of building a car, there is an option to download other players' cars off of Steam's Workshop. Personally I enjoy spending hour at a time making a car perfect at what it does, and if you enjoy a physics puzzle in a car like me, this is definitely what you've been waiting for, I know it's what I've always wanted, thank you RoKo0.-Update: A bunch of things have been added, but probably the biggest are; Angle Lock, Jet Engines, and Aerodynamics. With these new updates you can build planes, jet dragsters, and much more sturdy vehicles. One of the most entertaining things about the Aerodynamics is the ability to build incredibly fast racecars. Before you had no downforce, no matter what, but now you can add downforce, to help corners, air resistance, for an air brake, and so much more. The puzzle I speak of has been given more pieces, and am loving every update for the game. Once again, thank you Roko0.			",23,3,2,1,2,0,0

A Car Building Sandbox Racing Game


YouTubeâ¢ Video: [Early Access] Dream Car Racing 3D || Car Building Sandbox Racing GameÂ

+ The car editor is very easy to understand and use without any instruction.+ Lots of options to modify, for example: Wheel size, pressure, suspension, torque, transmission, etc., building a reliable car is actually pretty challenging.+ You can test out other user's creations, and modify them however you like which is a ton of fun!+ The map itself is HUGE giving you plenty of space+ Very easy to publish your car to the server / steam workshop without any hassle. It's also very simple to load up other creations, and takes no time at all.This game is in Early Access so these are subject to change- The engine sounds for every car need to be improved.- No background music- The physics are a bit odd. Every car is overly bouncy and need a bit more weight- The map itself is just a series of hills and mountains. Good for off-roading, but I feel like it would be great if the developer could add some flatlands or actual road racetracks.- The ""races"" are a bit unfair as the AI little cars don't have to deal with physics			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

								I had the original 2d Dream Car Racing. It was a concept that I thought was perfect for those of us who like to build and test things. That has been magically transformed into 3d and now we can all truly create our dream car. I have seen realistic looking vehicles in the workshop. I have also seen fantasy and scifi looking vehicles. If You enjoy creating vehicles to drive around for nothing more than fun, this might be for You.			",91,22,40,7,32,1,8

Early Access Review
								Iâve played many hours of Sandbox early access building games running on the unity physics engine so naturally I was attracted to the game when I came across it on Youtube. I must admit I bought the game on impulse without knowing too much about it but I thought the price was very reasonable so I took a chance although Iâve been disappointed many times in the past.I can now confidently say that the game has exceeded my expectations and is more than worth the price tag. If you are expecting another Besiege, Scrap Mechanic or Robocraft you are in the wrong place. The game will not hold your hand, this is not a Lego style âstick a bunch of blocks together and attach wheelsâ type of game. At first you will be frustrated after spending 3 hours building a car only to see it collapse under its own weight. You will go back to the drawing board, re-design the frame, re-tweak, test and repeat until finally you have a solid frame with awesome suspension and steering and you get that sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.As far as Sandbox games go, this is proper Sandbox as you are not limited by blocks and you donât have to stick to square angles. With only a handful of building parts you can make complex vehicles in any shape or size. What other content is in the game? The integration into the Steam workshop gives you endless things to play with as new maps are uploaded. Make your own racing tracks or just fool around with other peopleâs creations. There is Single player and multiplayer that I havenât even tried yet (Not sure if Multiplayer is out yet). In a nutshell you wonât get bored as there is plenty to.I was very impressed when I had questions or needed help in the Steam Community Discussions that the developer actually takes time to respond to you and assist where he can. The community also seems very helpful over all. The game is off to a great start for an early access and I havenât found any major bugs. I am very excited to see where the developer can take this.

								This game, for me, has taken more hours than any other game (except perhaps Skyrim with mods) and I still enjoy it.  It is early on and plans exist to expand it and include a lot more, but I am already having a blast making everything from as realistic a vehicle as it gets to utter wacko creations (walker isn't supported yet, but I've made a few, a 'grasshopper' as well and too many wheels for my sanity one too).Great fun if you like constructing vehicle and try out ideas and find solutions to 'why does this happen' and then realise the solution - if you experiment like me, any way.  Can also go the route I have not - make cars to race with.  I prefer exploring concepts myself.I hope to one day see the return of an actual, functional power transmission from engine to wheel (and eventually track etc), I do miss that and am no fan of magic power transfer without connection - but that is my only 'gripe' with the game, and I still sink too many hours into it still.  ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is all as of January 1, 2017 This could all change at the very next update!I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. The further I dive in I find you truly can create any 'at the time of writing' ground based vehicles. For me I have chosen a design inspired from Elio Motors because to my surprise no one on the workshop had even tried! So this tells me there is room for creative designs from all works of peoples. I highly recommend this but remember this is very early and things take time.Cons:This game is physics based so things can get wonky as one would espect ""Go Easy on the Dev!""-Parts are sometimes hard to select in the editor-Wheels can sometimes clip into the ground causing oddities.-There is officially one main level (There are modded ones.)Pros: -You can literally build any ground based that comes to mind.-You can mod maps and potentially parts as well.-It has a very fun upgrade system to make your parts stronger,faster,more weight,etc..-Each part in itself is scalable and can be painted to look very nice!I'm excited to see where this game goes in the year ahead of us!

Not only does this game allow you to build what ever you want like cars, trucks, tanks, and even planes, but it kinda gives you a challenge to make them work just right as well as there is a highly realistic physics system in the game, which I see as fun, others might not. I've always dreamed about desining my own cars, but now I can in this game! I myself probably have spent more time building and designing cars than actually driving them, because its really entertain to see something you've created slowly come to life!			",93,8,6,12,13,0,7

I've had it for less than a week at the time of this review, and I've sunk nearly 30 hours into it already.TL;DR:If you like building games, this is an excellent choice.For the marginally longer version:The basics of the game involve constructing a wire frame out of beams with ball joints. This means making triangular structures and chaining them together to get a sturdy chassis.Attach some wheels, an engine, some shocks and steering rods and BOOM! you have a car.Now make it better.

								If your on the fence or just.just get the game okay? its so fun to play, you can do so much in it already. its literally a sandbox game, like gmod, but is way more easier to use due to the way you build.			",44,6,6,3,14,1,0

								This game gave me the ability to create some really cool vehicle suspensions based on actual vehicles. Still a few bugs but the dev is very involved with the community and I'm sure they'll be fixed. I've been really enjoying the game and cant wait to see what the next update brings.

								This is really the kind of game that can be enjoyed by players who love to create and share their creations, play with realistic physics and enjoy driving vehicles.PROS :- The editor is practical. Using the 3 different views you can easily and precisely place a point wherever you want. A grid allows you to create well aligned stuff. It may look scary at first, but it's far, far, FAR simpler to use than a 3D modeling program. Within a few hours you will have understood all the basics required to make a complete car, chassis and bodywork, without having to read any kind of tutorial.- The games seems to be very optimized. You can add hundreds or parts to a car without ever noticing a framerate drop. It seems for example to be a lot optimized than other games such as Scrap Mechanic. As of today I have been able to create whatever I wanted to create without even thinking about performance.- The physics are realistic. Each part can strech, compress, vibrate, etc.- The (only) developper of the game seems to be very active and seems to care about the feedbacks of player, which is a very encouraging point.- The price. I paid this game about 11â¬. I think it's a fair price for this game in its current state.CONS :- The game has currently  very little content. You can do races along a track vs little ghost cars. You can drive around, trying to reach a checkpoint after another. You can roam freely to test your creation. And it seems like you can also play online multiplayer, without collisions between players, but I've no tested that yet. This is not surprising considering that this game is only a few monthes old. You wouldn't expect such a recent game to have a lot of content, especially since there is only one developper working on it.- There is not a lot of information about how to use the game. There is an in-game help which provides informations about the parts and their physical properties. However I think it would have been nice to have a little wiki and a few more tutorial videos for beginners. For instance, I took me a while to search information about what the ""angle lock"" part was used for. All the tutorial videos I could find were created before the update that introduced this part, so I couldn't find more information about it.- The developper working on this seems to be almost alone. While he seems to be very active, I'm not sure whether we can expect frequent updates or not, and how much content will come with each update.- The graphics are really outdated. I know that it's not what people would come for when buying this game, but since it's about being realistic, graphics matter too. Currently there are no asphalt marks, the wheels sometimes seem to sink a bit into the ground because the hitbox of the wheels get deformed based on tire pressure while the 3D model remains solid, there are no beautiful shadows or god rays, and since the maps can be procedurally and randomly generated, there are not many details. I think some official race tracks where players could compete would have been great.CONLUSION :I think it's a game worthy of its price which provides you with a freedom that you will never find in any other game that currently exist. There are concurrents like Scrap Mechanic or even Garry's mod, but none of them have the good performances and the freedom of building provided by Dream Car Racing 3D.Just like with any other early access game, the game has very little content, but it already allows you to create fully functionnal creations without any performance issue and that can be shared on the workshop, which is a very good start. The developpers seems to be planning to add more parts like wings, which suggest that we will be able to create other things than wheeled vehicles in the future.So in the end, if you like creating and inventing stuff, showing other people what you're capable of and enjoy realistic physics, if you have time and patience, if you care about creating quality stuff, then go for this game. You will probably like it, and even if you don't, well that's not even the price of a meal at McDonalds...			",17,5,2,2,3,0,1

								Very fun game! More complicated than the original 2D flash games, but after a couple minutes, it's not too hard to figure out. Highly recommended if you're a fan of sandbox games, racing games, or cars/mechanics.EDIT:Recent updates have added lift for panels and jet engines. I can't stop playing, making airplanes, flying go-carts, etc. This update made the game at least twice as fun, and for anyone who has learned how to design planes from games such as Kerbal Space Program or Simple Planes, I would challenge you to try in this game. It's more difficult (you have to manually design the control surfaces) but about 10x more rewarding.			",47,2,2,1,4,0,1

								Any bugs?:I have noticed a plethora of bugs, all of which were resolved within 24 hours (Except a recent one which the developer is working on/has fixed in this last update)How were the directions: Well, I practically re-wrote the directions/help (And had fun doing so, I love writing and tweaking my work and developing my communications skills) so if anything is confusing it is on me. Obviously I confidently support my work as good, but still, I am human. Error is inevitable.How much did I earn in single player before you got tired: I do not know, still not tired of this game. I've loged 170 hours by the time of this postSingleplayer: Needs tweaking, but is very good as it stands.Multiplayer: I like it, but I feel it should be tied in some way to single player in some way to motivate/force the player to gain experience in single player force. You do not want someone to see incredible records, try in vain to beat them, then rage quit and leave a bad review. (Very much my opinion)My position as a beta tester:For one to think that I am merely just another beta tester would simply be uninformed. I have distinctly left my mark on this game. That being said, I am just that, a beta tester. A beta tester lucky enough to get included in a project where he could make a difference. I have beta tested many games, but never have I enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed beta testing this game. I do not understand why he chose my email over anyone else's, but in the end (Speaking from that it is two days before release) I took the opportunity and ran with it.My opinion on the development of DCR 3D:I feel this game has the potential to be the next big thing. Roman (RoKo0) is an absolute genius (Coming from someone with a 140 IQ, I'm no genius, but I can recognize one), I can distinctly see where he made decisions in developing his IP (Intellectual property) that many would have mistakenly overlooked. For example, his decision to make 2D variations of his IP before making a 3D one. Doing this bagged him a following before he even started work on the 3D version. He stuck to his guns through the beta testing period, where I frequently pushed him to make the game more realistic. In the end, I feel he found the perfect balance between realism and the softer cartoon-ish side of the game that makes it so charming (Something that I milked with my recent map and car designs).How I started playing DCR:I first saw DCR on Flonga many years ago. I tried everything I knew to crack the game. Even downloading the flash version of the game and running it in an isolated environment and searching for changing variables with cheat engine (I.E, I would search all variables with cheat engine, then earn money search for changed variables, not earn money, search for unchanged variables etc...). The simple fact that I could not crack his game, hooked me and I soon bought the first iteration of his game (Admittedly, if it was more expensive, I would have tried harder and eventually at least hacked credits).My opinion of DCR 3D:Right now it is really fun (10/10, I mean it has kept me till the 240th Beta Test post, which is my 88th, and 170 in-game hours so far), but looking at his plans for the future, it is going to be so much better. I look forward to watching this game spread its wings, but I am not convinced that this game is completely ready to leave its chrysalis. That being said, I recognize that the game needs to be released sometime and that there is no better time than when you have everything working perfectly.			",17,1,1,0,2,0,1

								This game is an amazing improvement over previous dream car iterations with the 3D adding a new dimension of challenge to the builders. I got this game as soon as I could and love experimenting with the various building materials available to me. The game provides a number of ways for you to play it and the workshop is just as healthy and full of creative people as in other iterations of the game! My only real complaint for this game is that figuring out the steering system is a little bit complicated and involves a lot of trial and error, that being said, I still highly recommend this game!

								This is one of the best games i have ever seen. To be honest, this game is better than a lot of other racing games. Just to have the ability to make your own car, and i'm not saying just taking a car and being able to modify it, i mean build it from the bottom up. even if your not that creative and can't build a good car, you can always rely on the community. there are some SPECTACULAR creations made by the community. compared to a game such as rocket league, Dream car racing is first of all, cheaper and better in a lot of ways (almost all of them). definitely my go-to game for everything.

								Very awesome game, remember to reduce the elasticity of your frame parts - it'll save you an awful lot of early game frustration. The only thing really I would add to the game is some legitimate controller support, it would be nice if there was a more analog approach to gassing and braking instead of using WASD which makes for 100% gas and 100% brake whenever you touch the controls. A user friendly tutorial wouldn't hurt either, sort of reminds me of starting out in Beseige.			",226,34,6,24,33,2,14

								Amazingly fun game, difficult to figure out, but amazing once you do. Building cars in real life is one of my favorite past-times, so having some place where it doesn't cost me money to try out ideas is a great thing!If you have no creative imagination, this may not be the game for you, but if you love to tinker, then buy it right away!  I have only successfully built one solid vehicle so far, but getting into designing something to find out if it works is a lot of fun. Put the frame together, attach some wheels, an engine, shocks, and steering rod, and watch as it crumbles to pieces because you didn't brace it properly. Laugh about it, go back to the garage and figure out where you went wrong. If you build something worthy, set up a race, and challenge others to drive your custom car through waypoints to see if they can drive it better than you can! Overall, the game is still actively changing, but the developer is one that truly cares about the game, going so far as to talk to me personally, and ask me what I think. Never had this experience with any game before, so I can honestly say that I am excited to see what this game becomes!			",236,62,28,27,32,4,26

								I have been a fan of dream car racing evo for about a year, and was very excited to try out this 3D version! While building has become a LOT more complex in 3 dimensions compared to the 2D blueprint of previous games, it is certainly a lot more realistic, with the ability to truly experiment with different configurations and suspensions. A tough learning curve prevents me from fully enjoying the game so far, but I would definitely recommend it to those of you who know a bit about engineering (or would like to learn).I hope the creator releases a few tutorials for people like me who need a little guidance.

This is a game with serious potential in building capabilities.  It is very complex, looking at all the options going into it, but the complexity is clearly a testament to the amount of creative freedom the game allows you to have.  There is a ton of room for improvement of course, but It looks like those improvements are being worked on regularly.  I hope the development of this game continues into what I know it can be!

I haven't been on lately to check out the latest updates but so far I think if there were some way to add support for gamepads or in my case a force feedback wheel and some close racing or even destruction derby/ last vehicle standing wins would make it more awesome. The game could also benefit from greater detail on parts like gearboxes, dedicated steering systems and wheel hubs etc which I believe are in development for the future. Cheers RoKo0 for all your hard work on this game!Highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is amazing. It might take some getting used to, but once you are, you can make whatever. You can make your own custom dream cars! You can even make flying cars and glide to your destination! Even the suspension is felxible enough to make a jumping car or one which can handle the offroad like a beast. The developers are awesome also, so you can make sugestions and they commonly reply. They even make maps often so you can have something knew to lookforward to. There are little limits to this game, and i recommend it to all you people with good imaginations.			",13,2,4,1,7,0,1

								If you're passoned about cars and how they're made and would like to play around that, this game is for you.The build section actually feels more like simulation; finding the right geometry to make the chassis act like you want it to, finetuning the strenght of the parts to optimize the weight without compromising the structural integrity...the physics have all of the latest soft body simulation you could expect from a modern video game. Reminds me of BeamNG, but with a much appreciated DIY editor built in.Wether you want to make a basic road car, a monster truck or a formula one inspired geoetries, you will find all the elements you need to put your ideas into a driveable car!Racing then becomes so much more gratifying when you're the author of your vehicule; The single player mode has an awesome progression feature that lets you upgrade the different elements as you win longer and harder races, while the sandbox mode and online challenges adds a nice competitive side to it.The game itself is already in a very advanced state for being early access; it runs perfectly fine here with very little exception, yet the author keeps on adding features regardless, remaining open to suggestions from the users, which is very involving.If you like the idea of playing in a community with an accent on creativity and sharing ideas, I highly recommend you this game.Hoping to see you around on the scoreboard and the workshop ;)			",35,2,3,2,7,0,2

								An amazing game where you can build your own car, literally, just out of nothing and experiment, make your way trying, failing, trying again, till something that looks half good is accomplished, I'm obviously no designer or engineer, but I love spending a lot of time on this game, it has some sort of accomplishing feeling to it, knowing you've made something! The only complaint here is the graphics, they're feel very chunky and outdated, otherwise it's perfect!			",956,334,27,129,125,12,147

								I got the steam key from developers so that i can check out the game, well I must say, this game has potential, but in current state it's not that great.Graphics are very, very basic, sound effects are almost non existing, but I do hope they improve the game.I absolutely love the concept of this game, I like how you can freely design your car with in-game simplified model editor with almost no limits, you can put more than 1 engine, have like 100 wheels and stuff.Game also has steam workshop which makes it really good, so people can share their creations and also edit them.However what really made me press that YES button under ""recommend"" is that the game has soft body physics!Vehicles deform just like in BeamNG.It's too early to say anything else about the game, I didn't experience any of the usual bs that you get in other early access games, such as crashes, lag ..etc. Game runs smooth (over 200fps in 4k) and did not crash or glitch.What i'd like to see in the game:- better graphics + ability to add textures to your vehicles- pre-made objects that you can attach to cars (lights, mirrors, pedals, steering wheels ..etc)- realistic sounds (glass breaking, metal grinding, tyres screetching, tyres blowing up ..etc)- controller support! can't drive with keyboard ... it's painI think with those additions, this game can really shine :-)			",92,8,11,0,22,1,1

								I initially bought this game for multiplayer.  The multiplayer tag was on the steam front page.  Upon purchasing the game and searching forums I realized there was no multiplayer.  It is more of a leaderboard that you can race the times of other players.After speaking to developer he has since removed the tag and I thought it would be fair to edit my review.The game is  a interesting idea letting you create a vehicle with simple pieces and drive around a sandbox to test your creation.  If you like physics games this can be interesting.  Although I played about 16hours total messing around with the builder, I grew tired of the single player aspect.For me, I would not recommend this game do to the lack of multiplayer. Although this is just my opinion.  If multiplayer is added in a way to have a realtime race even without collision, I would recommend this game.  As it is now I would not. ",7,2,1,4,4,0,9

								If you enjoyed building complex contraptions in garrysmod and testing them on community maps, but found it limiting or frustrating sometimes, then this is the game for you. Well worth supporting, and fun to learn with comprehensive tutorials and online videos to get you started. A perfect 9/10!			",136,28,5,26,23,1,24

								This is a good game its fun to drive around in the workshop creations but building the cars is way too complicated. the devs should add a ""simplistic"" build mode where you build a car as you would in dream car raceing 1,2 and evo. Or just get build helpers where you make a frame and then the build helper adds the transmission steering ect.			",6,1,1,0,2,0,0
