												I like trucks.I dont like this game.Ok, for real. This game is so bad that everything explains itself when you check the date in launcher. build 1.094, Jan, 07, 2006.When you boot up the game you get greeted from an Installer. You need to install the game from yourself. If you just click next it will install under Program Files(x86) and you need to start it from hand from there. The Steam folder hast just the trucker.exe in it, which is just the installer.So you need to copy everything over to the Steam folder and replace/rename the old trucker.exe ....yay, we can start the game from Steam and clock gametime/idle cards for it.Next is that the max resolution is 1280x960.And no Steam Overlay of course.Game runs choppy, not acceptable for an 2006 game :emofdr: the driving itself feels like :poop: too.You cant play in window mode either, alt+return doesnt work and no setting for it.I wont write a detailed review, thats enough. Just dont buy it. Buy some McChicken for it, way more value.			",1850,429,128,195,284,20,247

												This is a review of Steam's acceptance system more than anything. How does this get accepted!? This game runs like absolute trash, maximum resolution is 1280x960 with a 32 FPS cap! On Steam, it downloads an external installer, then actually downloads the game. I feel like my copmuter now has several viruses!			",265,38,4,19,26,3,12

												I have no problem with old games, in fact i love games of the 1990-2000 era, but come on, this game doesn't even run by itself, it puts an installer and links to it..Then you launch the game and realize it doesn't handle controllers properly.Then you start the tournament and you realize how laggy it is.I've played only some minutes and found the gameplay to be too bad to be enjoyable.. especially with keyboard only.This game is not playable..
