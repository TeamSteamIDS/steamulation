												This is, by far, the best thing I have ever seen on the rift. I honestly could not see how they could improve on the 3D experience. The depth and scaling of the scenes really make it pop, and it gives a quite beautiful landscape (think James Cameron Avatar fluorescent night scene type coloring and style). I received almost 0 ill effects from this game (an 8 hours session in half life 2 gives me a pretty bad headache). The game is fun and you can kill time in it pretty quickly without even realizing.  It’s also nice that they allow you to control yourself with both your headset and a keyboard, as they give completely different experiences.However, the game definitely needs some tweaking in a few areas.#1 The random generators can be completely unfair. I once made a perfect run on a track in hard mode, and still lost 30 seconds. Kind of ruins the fun of a game when you are constantly put in unwinnable scenarios.#2 Starting in hard mode, you get a bowling ball type obstacle. This obstacle can also make the game completely unfair. For example, you’re coming up on a 5-protein chain, but have the bowling balls before it. They are not likely to make it through to the red walls. I cannot find a sure way to hit the balls to guarantee at least 1 will get through.#3 Sometimes the vertical climbs can be just a bit too steep, and the red walls come up so quickly, there is literally no time to make a guaranteed dodge, leaving it up to luck.Although, I’m sure these problems can be fixed without having to make any large changes to the codebase, so I expect the authors will be able to get this right some point soon (“A Story About My Uncle” being a great example of early-access developers listening to the fans on gameplay tweaking :-) ). Oh. And achievements are always nice ;-)			",283,90,2,28,21,1,23

												InCell is an action/racing game with a bit of strategy and educational thrown into the mix.


YouTube™ Video: InCell VR - Gameplay & Review - A Sheepish Look At 

			Views: 1,413		

			Genna plays InCell VR. A Virtual Reality focused game where you enter the human body to fight off a virus. Click here to Subscribe ► http://bit.ly/mrwssub...		

The game is focused on Virtual Reality, but you can play just fine without a set.Your goal is to reach the center of a cell inside a human body, to eliminate a virus.The main gameplay has you constantly driving down a long cyllindrical track, that you can only rotate around to avoid obstacles, get speed boosts or collect protein (money). Within levels, there is a virus chasing behind you, that will kill you if you hit too many obstacles.The level selection actually has a bit of fun strategy to it. You can select which part of the cell you'd like to go to next. Depending on which one you choose, the difficulty of the level will be different, as well as the selection of upgrades you will have at the end. Some will give you more speed, or slow down the virus chasing behind you.The game looks beautiful, and I can only imagine how immersive it can be with a set of VR goggles.Overall, it's a cool game that might interest you, check it out!

												Not a bad game but it is the only VR game that made my daughter and me sick. The rollercoaster gameplay and the lean to turn did not agree with us at all. The visuals were great and the effort that went into making the game is apparent and appreciated. It did start to get repetitive even though the story was progressing the gameplay seemed to be the same stuff with a different motive for doing the same thing over and over. Unfortunately, it is not a game for us and we will probably never play it again.			",64,15,3,1,8,2,3

												A great game, especially in Oculus ^^ You can control everything with your head, which is amazing! Basically there are two modes - you can just explore the world (cell) and relax, sliding through space with a great soundtrack, or you can increase difficulty so that game becomes challenging!

												Great fun and all around enjoyable to experience. As good as the inCell gameplay and art are however, I have to say the gameplay has awoken some real F-Zero GX craving, I never new how much I needed a VR F-Zero game before now. Anyway, InCell VR is an enjoyable experience with or without VR and I suggest you try it out if you are interested.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

												There are three reasons why I tried this game.  1) It's free. 2) The video for this game showed it to be a trippy microbology themed rollercoaster ride which is exactly what it was.  3)  Also, I was curious to know if I would experience motion sickness.  After 55 minutes of gameplay I did not.    I enjoyed it. ",17,17,2,1,8,0,0

												The Vive support doesn't seem to be working nearly as well as the developer's other game InMind. The ""cockpit"" that you sit in is smaller and placed at a height that requires you to stand up to see through the front window and use the UI - but the gameplay is designed for seated position. They need to center the cockpit (or is it a helmet?) around your head, or make it room-sized like in InMind. Also, there's no reason why this couldn't use the Vive controllers for steering rather than awkwardly tilting your head. You can see the controllers in-game but they have no effect on anything.

												As a simple racer with a tutorial and three levels this game is not terribly complex, and the fact that it should be relatively short makes it seem like it should be easy to polish off with some practice. Basically you are trying to stay ahead of your enemy (the virus wave) and the clock in the corner will show you how much of a lead time you have on it. If it catches up to you, you're dead and have to restart the level from the beginning. The level is broken into several jumps between organelles with the ultimate destination being the cell nucleus.Unfortunately the game is beset with a bug that hampers progression. While each level increases in difficulty (which is why you'll need some practice), I was never able to make it past level two even though coming close (within the last couple of seconds) several times. I kept thinking this was purely a matter of skill until I began paying closer attention to my choices.As you step though a level you are given a choice of what path forward you want to take and that choice will grant you a bonus depending on what kind of organelle it is -- i.e, a time buff or additional proteins (used as currency in the game). However when I started paying attention I noticed these buffs often were not applied. So for instance I might choose a path that gave me a 10 second time buff, more often than not my clock would be exactly the same going into the next race. Same thing happened for additional currency -- more often than not you wouldn't get it. Yet another bonus will allow you to identify ""masked"" organelles for the rest of the level so you can better choose your path, but they remain masked.This severely impacts level two because even if you perform each run flawlessly, it's often not enough to stop the virus wave from catching you. Winning is then no longer a matter of skill but instead that PLUS sheer random luck of the game generating easy tracks with optimal placement of speed boosts. And even so the final track of the level (into the nucleus) is always hard (due to having the fewest speed boosts) unless you get a bonus that knocks that final track down to easy. And what do you think the chances are that bonus will be applied? ... yeah, ahem. I have encountered true easy tracks in which you'll lose up to 14 seconds of lead time even if you hit all the speed boosters, so you can imagine what a hard track is like. Rating: 4/10Simple, clean design with good visuals. But not worth banging your head against the desk. ",215,149,4,23,24,0,24

Though it is short, feels like a chore to finish the game and very repetive with an FTL inspiration but kind of an easy version of it. You can't argue its still free to give you the taste of VR.Played with HTC Vive and got no motion sickness, however in other reviews some people do mention they are getting sick from playing this so beware of that issue.

There are a lot of things happening on screen and you, the player, move at a vary of speeds ranging from mild to a roller coaster. I got somewhat disorientated and I don't want to imagine playing this on VR headset. A few things I want to point out-- the narrator reminds me of the narrator from Stanly Parabole, only female and a robot. She insults you when you mess up and praises you when, from lack of better words, do well. - the control options are nice  +arrow keys +VR headset +and lastly, gamepad-smooth graphics-realistic cell description -interesting background story			",27,41,1,7,15,0,1

												There isn't, as far as I can tell, a real point to this game. I like the idea behind it but I feel the execution was poorly done and developed. The graphics are beautiful and if your playing on a PC (by the way I am happy that a VR game is FINALLY avaliable for those without VR, just wish it could've been a more interesting one) it is extremely user-friendly though I imagine that it is probably better with the actual game-system it was intended for. Nevertheless, all this game is is you swirling around to the finish line to beat the virus. I don't know what I expected from this game, but I definately expected more than this.Overall Rating: 3/10 (would've been 2/10 but +1 extra point for amazing graphics and the idea behind it)			",5,4,2,4,1,0,1

												This game/viciously cruel trick does not make any sense, especially in VR! This is a great example of what a VR experience not be! I for example expected to be inspired by an interesting, scientific, and educational expierience inside of a cell of some kind. What I got was something more like a psychotic, vicious, practical joke on my visual senses. When the game launches the user is imediately and unexpectedly ejected from a peacful existance to a horrible mad-house style, uncontrollable, roller coaster.I can't imagine anyone enjoying this, if you look closely you can tell by the reluctant look on the girls face in the trailer video when she is putting on the HMD she actually looks like she is about to throw up.After playing this game for under five minutes I was literally nauseated/sick all day long, it obviously ruined my day.

And its a superb motion sickness trainer. This takes that concept, and knocks it out of the ballpark!

												Yes very good game, now only if my biology and organic chemistry classes had such graphics! This game worked so much better on a my large 4K monitor and wireless Xbox 360 controller than VR. Fun outrunning viruses and, exploring the cell structures and proteins. Wish I had more time to explore before the virus made its way!			",5,4,1,0,3,0,0

												Really fun game.  Some of the most fun sequences are the inter-level scenes where you travel through a cell and see cell structures all around you.  Very cool.The game itself is basically a race along a tube, where head motion strafes you left/right along the tube as you fly forward.  Standing and doing this with the Vive is hard.  Sitting is good, but the head motion control will probably make you a little woozy if you get sick easily.  I didn't get sick, but after almost 10 minutes of playing, I think I would have if I had kept going.			",91,16,2,7,14,3,10

Although the visuals are beautiful, I can not recommand this game neither to show VR to your friends, nor to play and have fun. Avoid at all cost, for your own health!It's a shame, because it could have been a fun game.			",1097,387,27,121,130,12,169

												VIVE REVIEWthe menus and environment are an amazing world to be in, flying down the top of pipes is quite accelerating!However, this is my first VR… or any game experience for that matter to make me feel sick. I picked the game up twice to give it a fair assessment (trying out both the keyboard and head tilt steering) and im am afraid to say I can only make it to the end of the second level before I have to take the headset off.It might just be me that can’t handle this experience, and I really want to shout its praises for a free game which does not feel like another VR demo. I will likely pick this up again to play outside of VR			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played on a Vive.It's quite pretty, but also really nauseating. I found that if you tilt your head in short bursts rather than keeping it tilted, the nauseating effect can be reduced (but not eliminated). Not willing to play it long enough to make a firm determination about the gameplay, because if a game causes nausea, whether it is ""good"" or not doesn't really matter.The game is free though, so not really anything to lose.

												InCell is a tech demo with weak gameplay that can be a visually pretty look at human cells, whether playing this in VR or not. I cannot recommend this as a game, but can recommend it as a tech demo with motion sickness caution for VR players.Here is why I call this a tech demo: No configuration options except a few hot keys on the Store page, no sound configuration, cannot save progress between stages within a level, when starting a level and panning down the subtitles will clip/hide into the track, very simple collect/boost/slow gameplay, modifiers acquired thus far cannot be viewed, and UI is not always intuitive as to what needs to be clicked to progress or purchase items.
