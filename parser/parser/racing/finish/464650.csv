RunbowRunbow is a 9 player party platformer action game which has some cut throat multiplayer battles. Does it race away to victory against its other competitors or gets sweeped across in its own colours, let’s find out:Gameplay:Runbow tasks you with a very simple job, run and reach the end before any of your friends do while trying not to fall down or get steam rolled in the way. Each game is pretty short too, lasting a minute or two. If you die  One game that instantly came to mind while playing Runbow was Speedrunners. And it’s hard not to compare the two, both of them having similar gameplay and a similar type of target audience. Runbow has a very interesting mechanic that keeps it different from other games. Every few seconds, a wave of colour sweeps over the screen making various objects and platforms appear and disappear according to their respective colours. This makes for a very fun and refreshing change as you have to be on the lookout for colour pause at the start of screen every time the sweep happens. It is incredibly frustrating when you jump for a platform in reach but the colour changes just in time so that you fall down to your death instead of making a perfect jump. This mechanic is used everywhere, from the waterfalls to the lasers, with even lasers disappearing in a particular set of colours. Leave its pretty visuals aside and Runbow is a very difficult game. You will die early and quickly if you don’t observe your environment enough. Runbow needs you to stop dead in the tracks and watch how different colours change the obstacles ahead. You also have to watch out and punch and smash your teammates to get them out of the equation. This makes all the difference between winning and watching a skull sarcastically pointing out your mistakes every time you die. While Runbow is a blast to play with friends, its solo play is very lacking from the get go. There are no bots available for playing solo which is a big dealbreaker. To make up for this, Runbow features a number of game modes including Adventure mode, where a black and white character feels a bit left out of all the fun and colours going on with the characters. King of the hill and arena mode are reminiscent of Super Smash bros where you try to make other characters fall down from the platforms instead of running to the end. There is a lot of customization available here for the characters too where you can select their colours, hats and a plethora of other things. All of this still feels lacking when you are playing solo. Without anyone else on the screen, Runbow’s world feels very empty since it’s not designed with that sort of gameplay in mind. The maps are somewhat randomized every time you play so it doesn’t feel as repetitive. Runbow’s pc porting has been decent. The game feels better and easier to play with a controller than with a keyboard. There is an option to change key bindings which is a godsend as it’s default key controls are the weirdest I’ve seen to date in a platformer. There are also a few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking.Visuals:For a game based on colours, Runbow feels a bit bland when you fire up the game for the first time. There is a drab green background and everything that is an object is made up of black. Slowly though, the game grows on you. When the colour sweep happens the colours truly pop out and give a soothing effect on the eyes. Some parts like the waterfalls are also very well done and there are fluid animations for everything. The cutscenes are colourful and are done quite nicely. Overall, Runbow stays true to the name and provides a lot of colours in each frame.Sound:The sound design of Runbow is excellent. From the thumping soundtrack to the taunts that your characters make, everything compliments the environment created by the visuals. There were a few audio issues here and there but I hope they will be patched soon enough.Overall:Runbow is made to be played with friends. If you’re expecting decent soloplay then you won’t find it here. There are a lot of game modes available but none of them are built so that you can play it alone. The lack of bots is really frustrating but once your friends arrive on the couch it is a completely different experience. Runbow is like a more methodical and slower version of Speedrunners with a huge emphasis on colours and how they affect your surroundings. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends, you can give Runbow a try.Verdict: 80/100This review was brought to you by Pcgamesnnews.

												Oh boy... I waited for this game for so long on PC, there's a big emotional charge to it, but it isn't what I will talk about.Let's talk about up to 9 player multiplayer...  up to 9 player multiplayer on the same device. I know this is very niche, but so far this is the only game that alowed a very party-like play on pc, 2 people on the keyboard, 4 on wireless 360 controllers, the rest on traditional cable joysticks and a LOT of fun.Just filling this gap was reason enough to recommend this!

												TONS OF FUN!!I've been waiting for this game for a while and its finally on Steam. Great for when you have friends over, or for when you need a quick laugh. Online modes are awesome, the chaos makes it so much fun!I only wish you could see the name of the player instead of the name of the character when you win a round.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

												I am really into coop games these days since I have a few friends that are always down to play with me. We gave this game a go and it was an awesome time. Whenever I see one in particular that rages and others laugh at him, I know we have a hit in our hands. There are some small nags with controls and I don`t like how the power up just auto shoot whenever you pick them up but overall it is a very solid coop game that deserves much more attention. There are many modes and levels and it can last you a lot long.I am very sad that this game went pretty much unnoticed, and I blame that on the horrible new way steam is setting up its front store page where you have to actually go and look for new releases. For this reason noone is playing this online which is a shame, damn shame indeed. I hope it gets a second chance.			",128,32,1,3,9,0,9

												First of all, I must say. The colors are AMAZING. They add tons of life and flair into the game, plus add an extra challenge to throw you off track if you don't play attention. The music is very catchy as all can be, and the controls are stunningly easy to use! The replay value is high, and the DLC adds to the fun! I recommend this to anyone who loves platforming and a fun challenge, because you'll be playing this for a long while once you get the hang of it. 10/10 ",6,2,0,0,2,0,0

												RUNBOW:~~~~~~~~ Have you heard of this femme fatale named “SATURA?” She dresses in black and looks down at you with her chilling eyes! But you can face her on your own, you debonair player. Naah - I have a better idea . . . let’s call a bunch of friends; at nine against one, I think the odds are slightly in our favour! Or, we can leave the lady alone and see which of us can reach the trophy first! Hmmm, maybe jump in the Arena for bit of a rumble. Whatever tickles your fantasy . . .  It’s RUNBOW time! RUNBOW is platformer/local and online multi-player game which supports up to nine players in a game session. Swinging into the main menu (boys and girls, this soundtrack is a cracker), you will be able to select one of five modes of play which includes two single player modes (but you can still have up to nine friends playing with you in these). In the Adventure mode, the goal is to reach a trophy as fast as possible under a specific time to be rewarded with three golden coins. Well, that’s nice and easy but there is a bit of twist in RUNBOW. Every few seconds a different coloured background (a palette of four to eight colours) will pass through (from left to right or from top to bottom, depending on the level) and as you move as fast as possible, you will see platforms appearing or disappearing, depending on their colours and on the colour of the background. So you will be able to jump onto a blue platform that’s on an orange background, but be sure to jump off before the blue background comes by or you will fall down the . . . AAHHHHHH! On top of that, you will have to avoid spikes, defeat strange enemies and clear 140 levels!In The Bowhemoth, you will have to get out of the beast’s belly and beat the toughest level in the game. This is quite a challenge, to be honest.For the local and online modes: “Get ready to RUN,” “Step into the ARENA,” and “All hail the KING OF THE HILL” are the three modes of play. Be the first one to reach the shiny silver trophy in the “RUN”. Be the last character standing in the “ARENA” or fight a fierce battle to control a single point in the “KING OF THE HILL.” On the downside, it is difficult to find an online game.Plenty of challenges, costumes and characters to unlock including seventeen indie special guest characters.Graphically, RUNBOW looks good and the soundtrack is absolutely marvellous! In terms of the difficulty it increases gradually throughout the adventure, difficulty from start in the Bowhemooth. I think the controls could have been better, especially if you’re trying to do a double jump with a boost (my take on the double jump + attack action), but hopefully you will master it better than I have!Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Good graphics-	Great gameplay-	Single player / local and online multiplayer modes-	140 levels to clear (single player)-	Plenty of things to unlock including 17 Indie character guests-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	Can be frustrating at time (controls)-	Not many people onlineThis is a great game to play with your friends, either locally or online, and it also provides a large number of single player levels.8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
