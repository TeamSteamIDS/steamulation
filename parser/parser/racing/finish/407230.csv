												I've played many many RPGs in my day. Starting with Wizardry games on the PC when I was young and onto Final Fantasy, playing the newer ones as they came out. I was a PlayStation girl so I played the Personas, Xenogears, Grandias, Shadow Hearts - okay, listing them all would take too long and is off the topic. But I want you to know how well-versed I am in this genre. :)Legend of Mysteria is the first RPG I've played on Steam that was obviously made using one of the generic RPGmakers and isn't a ""big hit"" game. I thought I'd give something different a chance. And I'm extremely glad I did.Now, it's listed as a turn-based RPG but it's really all about an involving story where you do some serious detective work. In all the hours I played, I fought only a little over 10 battles - half of those, bosses. There is no leveling in this game whatsoever. You have to find different equipment to bolster your stats. And you play as a mage so the trick is figuring out what your enemy is weak against and then finding a staff or accessories that allow you to cast the elemental spell that will annihilate your target the quickest.The meat of the game is interviewing everyone you can. Everyone thinks you're a murderer so you have to find the real culprit and clear your name. Of course, being that people view you as a killer, you must disguise yourself. You begin in a tower full of all different types of mages. You'll need to switch robes often to fit in with whatever group you're spying on. You also get different dialog choices here and there so think carefully before answering. Searching everywhere and everything is a must since you need those different colored robes, and reading notes and diaries on all the mages will help you find clues and point you towards those who might be willing to help you in your cause.I would say this game is difficult. The times I had to turn to a walkthrough, I would sit there reading it thinking ""who in the world would know this is what you're supposed to do?"" But the story was so interesting that I had to see it to its end. What you do during the entire game affects what will happen at the very end. It's just very neat.So in conclusion, this is not your typical RPG. It's frustrating at times and... no leveling? I'm  a girl who loves to level for hours so I can swat the last boss like a bug. In this game, I actually had to strategize my fights and manage my healing potions with care. :p  However, I loved Legend of Mysteria. I was never bored, the characters were interesting and detailed, and I really approved of the music selections they chose from the RPGmaker. The fact that I'm even writing this review at all says a lot because I don't really want to be doing this. I want to be playing! I just wanted you to know how much fun I had with this unique adventure. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Disclaimer: I was given a key for this game for free.Full Review (for my original Quick First Look just scroll down):Legend of Mysteria is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series and story wise a prequel. While there are a lot of familiar characters and the main area of the game is the so called Mysteria Tower, the story can be enjoyed on it's own, without any prior knowledge. However if you have played Labyronia RPG 1 and 2, Legend of Mysteria will give some nice additional insights. The main storyline, the murder of a high rank mage called Dinyon and Windir (the player character) trying to clear his name, while being accused of being the man behind the dirty deed, is a very well put together detective story that will keep you guessing until pretty late who the true culprit is.As I have already said in my First Look, gameplay wise is where the biggest different lies between Legend of Mysteria and the original Labyronia RPG games. While all 3 titles share their RPG Maker VX Ace foundation, the later are more traditional CRPG games with a quite a heavy focus on battles. Legend of Mysteria on the other hand plays more like a classic Point & Click adventure with hardly any battles at all and even then, there is no real RPG style character progression, XP system etc. This game is about exploring your locations, talking to NPC, gathering evidence, finding and using items to unlock new and previously locked rooms and areas. At this point it needs to be noted that even though I have played a lot of adventures in my gaming career (including most LucasArts Games and even more Sierra Games), I did get stuck quite a lot. This is not due to strange tasks to be done, but rather the fact the due to the absence of a quest log, the player should really start writing (I mean really writing with pen & paper!!) down notes. Thankfully to a kind player, there is a full walkthrough in the community guides section!In conclusion I can highly recommend this game to both fans of the series for the insight it shares to the lore of Labyronia, as well as to everbody looking for a RPG Maker game that doesn't follow the usual steps a RPG Maker game does take! -------------------Quick First Look:Legend of Mysteria RPG is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series; actually according to the title screen it should be called ""Labyronia Tales Legend of Mysteria"". Hence anybody who is familiar with the main series, will feel right at home, as there many characters one would have already met and familiar locations, only at a different time and with new content. This should not scare of newcomers, since it is an independent story that doesn't require any prior knowledge. Gameplay is where the Legend of Mysteria RPG seems to have changed the most, at least from what I have seen so far. It actually feels way more like a classic adventure game with RPG elements. In the beginning the player character, a mage called Windir, gets innocently accused of attacking and possibly murdering another Mage called Dinyon. Now it is time to find the real culprit and clear Windir's name. This all happens in traditional adventure game style, that is talking to NPCs, doing favors for them and finding ways to access new areas.What about the battles, you might be asking by now? There are battles, but unlike in Labyronia RPG 1 + 2, it actually will take some time until you will have your first encounters. Despite appearing to be easier now, simple attack spamming still won't get you anywhere - just don't forget that Windir is a mage!In conclusion I can easily recommend this game to fans of Labyronia RPG, because it is more Labyronia, even though it kinda feels different now. There are many characters appearing from the main series as well as well-known locations featuring additional content (new areas). However this should not turn off newcomers, as no prior knowledge is required to make sense of what is going on.NOTE: I will update this quick first look with a full fledged review, once I have finished the game.

A Prequel to Labyronia RPGThis game is about exploring your locations, talking to NPC's, gathering evidences, finding and using items to unlock new and previously locked rooms and area.Pros:• Windir's story.• Crime investigation.• Plot is really good.Cons:• Really hard puzzles & quests.

												I had hopes for this game since it's opening premise is interesting enough and though its made in the RPG maker the maps and items for the game where customized enought and look nice, buuuuut...The game becomes a snore fest after a couple of hours, at the start it's interesting enough to read all the documents and uncover clues to find out who framed you, but then it becomes a nightmare of finding objects and find where you are supposed to use them, some of them I have no idea how you where supposed to find out the solution without a walkthough.There is not nearly enough tips in the game as of how to use certain items, for example, how are you supposed to know Djinni is able to spy on people if you put its crystal in a nearby ""cup"" or ""bucket"" ? How are you supposed to know which object corresponds to which crystal in the corridor of elements to get the tome of elements?Horrid nightmarish time waster. Get the cards and get out.

												Got this as part of the ""Labyronia Bundle"" wich contains Labyronia 1,2 and this turd of a game.The labyronia ones were fun... this one is just awful....First it's not even a JRPG is a bad ""Point and click adventure"" in which you will spend most of your time just walking the same hall with the same horrible music just to test the item you just got with every npc and door hoping it will work and give you another item to... guess what? do the same all over again.Terrible in all aspects.  I was so bored that I had to stop playing... it's not worth the time even with a walkthought to 100% it.The only good thing about it.... it's that it gives you a free code for Polarity (A portal's clone of sorts)Stay away from it unless you find it VERY CHEAP in a bundle or something... (all 3 labyronia games for under $0.49 will give you profit just by selling the cards, even more if you count Polarity.) ",81,29,1,8,7,1,13

												I wanted to complete Labyronia 1 & 2 before I review this, but now that I have I think it's about time I reviewed Legend of Mysteria.First off I'm not a big fan of rpg games, I haven't played them a whole lot like I play racing games, or first person games. Yet, I saw the game was on sale for 51 cents, and I thought, ""Why not?""I must say I am glad I spent the $.51 on this game. I haven't had much fun playing rpg games in a long time until I tried this and the Labyronia series. The soundtrack of the game is probably one of my favorites out of most games I've played. The battles with enemies could be a bit challenging, but nonetheless the gameplay did not fail to make up for it. It was definitely difficult playing the game since it required so much I had to use use walkthroughs like guides or videos to help me out for the rest of the game. I still couldn't complain though, I enjoyed the many puzzles and clues throughout the game.There's a lot of questions I have IF this happened before Labyronia since Windir and Triste marry each other and have a child, and in Labyronia, you find out Arres is their son. Yet the release dates of the games throw me off so I'm not sure if that speculation would be valid enough to say that Legend of Mysteria happened before Labyronia. Either way, much props to the developers of this game. The only thing I would suggest is to fix the brightness of the game. Besides that, great game, and I'd suggest this to anyone who are willing to play rpg games and enjoy long stories.			",140,25,10,16,3,1,6

												One of the most incredible stories I've ever seen.For a guy who is new to the Labyronia Saga, I had fun with it. This game is not much like a fighting type game (you have only more than 3 to 5 fights required throughout the game, others you can take just for fun), but instead it is a kind of puzzle, you need to do some Actions to proceed in the game.It seems this story is the legend of ""the hero of Labyronia,"" so for many ppl those individuals are well known, some people will say that the story is not worth it, others will love it, as for me I really loved everyone secrets and twists. It's a short game, but if it was big would ruined the whole point of the game and the price is very good. (BTW I played with a controller and it actually worked smoothly.)The story is complex, but easy to explain. You are Windir, an air mage in a tower full of other mages of different types and the head mage was murdered in front of everyone when he talked about changing things and you were framed for it. You have figured out how to escape and disguise to pass unknown by the other mages while you try to solve the murder to clear your name. From that, things happen, you realize that the old man was right, many things WILL change, and you collect evidence and more to find the guilty and prove your self as innocent.The gameplay is as good as a RPGMaker might be, at some points you need to be very precise with the items you need to have, the timming and (which really bothered me a lot) the specific locations to use these items. This actually buggy me a few times, for example a candle where you can interact with more than one side (right, up, down, left) you can light it (with the specified item) from just one side; Another example was a switch on a statue between statues ... if your game is a bit buggy (as mine was in some spots) or you get to feel up a little tired, you can lose a lot easily, and this is a pain .. .My rating, and for a RPGMaker game, is a 9/10			",240,44,2,20,10,5,18

												The 3rd part of the labyronia series. This time its like a prolog or Nr. 0 of the other games. It has a few changes. No leveling and only a few less battles that are tough like boss fights and you need to have prepared with ""enough"" items and right elements. Not a hard burden if you be prepared with many items. This game has like the other games a nice story with many traders and you need to find out the assassin of the attack of the intro and need to find many clues and to use some quests and puzzles. So you are this time like a detectiv and search for hints, hidden items, secret passages and unseen switches/ keys you need so search every corner and each item from all 4 sides, read carefully a lot of stuff (books and many more) to find the right ways. I love this game even much then the others. Sometimes you feel lost because its so hard to find the answer you need to test many items with many peopls and things to find all of it. The music is fine and the game lenght is good if you dont need to much hints from the walktrough and test many combinations yourself. This little personal master piece for me get so 9.3 of 10 points as on of the best 2 D games with a really lovely story, dont forget to play after this Labronia  1 & 2 if you didnt do it before. So take a look, preview or lets play and i hope you support the great developer with some money for his work/ time. He still try his best to make the game better if you give him something you dont like like i did 2 little points. So i hope many people enjoy the search after the TRUTH :)			",2539,1137,74,266,297,25,355

												Not at all like the previous two titles.  Very little combat and the story is basically a murder mystery.  Instead of clues, you mostly have to randomly guess where to go and what to pick up and the game is nearly impossible without a guide.  Labyronia 1 and 2 were great but this game is just tedious.

												I really REALLY enjoyed this game. I bought this in a JRPG bundle and this was the best game in it. It is surpringly hard - the little puzzles and mysteries took me a while to figure out (and sometimes it was so hard I had to have a sneaky look at one of the online guides...). But it was really nice to spend a few hours figuring out all the twist and turns. The story is really interesting and the characters are memorable. I wasn't sure how I felt about the main character but the more time I spent with him the more I realised what an interesting character he was (and how adorably awkward he was with Triste!). My only gripe with this game is that there aren't many battles and no level-up system or anything. It would have been nice to have that - but the story and mystery DEFINTELY makes up for it. Highly recommend this game - really impressed with it :)			",24,16,0,11,2,0,2

												Disclosure: Received a review copy. Labyronia part 3 is up to testing after getting a review key and to my great surprise it is not actually a real sequel to the first two games but instead a prequel to the events to come in part 1 and 2. In addition the game type has changed from typical JRPG style adventure to a more 'detective story' type of gameplay where Windir from earlier games is the protagonist who tries to solve a murder taking place in a mage school and clear his name as he is framed for the murder. After some 6h i must say the game is of same high quality as the previous games in the series. i.e. what it lacks in original art and assets it gains in good design. I guess you could say the dev did not spend his time at the art drawing board but instead did good work on the design board and it really shows. Lots of details and well tested gameplay as i have not seen any bugs yet. As it looks now Labyronia games are some of the best what this old game engine can offer and therefore a warm recommendation to anyone who wants good games for cheap with high production values.

												Recently I've played a decent amount of RPG games and I have to say that I am starting to like them more and more. Got ""Legend of Mysteria"" in a bundle and payed about 10-15 cents for it. You can literally get more than that by selling the cards that drop when you play the game, lol. But, unlike some other cheap games that I've played this is one of the best. As you can see it took me a bit more than 8 hours to finish the game and get all the achievements. Although It can be done faster I followed a step-by-step walkthrough and even so it took that long. I mentioned this in another review but I will say it again: A guy had written in a review that for every 1 euro game he/she expects to get at least 1 hour worth of gameplay. So if we follow this logic I got the game almost free and I spent 8 hours playing it meaning the price it has is pretty good, right? Yea, I'd say so. Okay, so you have to do quests, fight monsters, collect items, explore, buy stuff, talk to people. Honestly the map is pretty big so there's a lot to do. I am glad there is a guide. I'd be lost without it. While some of the things that you need to do are pretty straightforward, others require some thinking. Really fun to play. Actually, I added 2 other RPG games to my wishlist. They are made by this dev and are called ""Labyronia"" and ""Labyronia 2"". I checked other players' stats and seems like they are even longer than this game for the same price. Wow! I feel like a guy that has found a gold mine! And I am not even exaggerating. I am saying this because I've seen some flash games on Steam that are worth 3-5 euros. Rip-off! If you manage to get ""Legend of Mysteria"" on sale you can at least idle for cards and still make profit. 10/10			",659,288,14,45,72,10,91

												Purchased the Labyronia Bundle for 2.99. Finished Legend of Mysteria and would've more than paid double just for the one game. The graphics are very Final Fantasy Tactics, there are about five, maybe, actual battles that are turn based and easily won. This game is much more about figuring out the palace/tower/race intrigue than duking it out. For the entire game you HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION! Read everything, notice the symbols, things that look like decoration probably aren't, if you have looked in every single goblet and turned up empty, the one you don't check will be the one you need. The puzzles give you everything you need - if you can't figure it out with what you've got, go back and see what you missed picking up.			",19,20,0,14,2,0,4

												Legend of Mysteria RPG is a prequel to the Labyronia saga. It has great a great storyline and BGM, however the amount of walking around the same areas you do is very tedious.From my expierence i was following the story perfectly and suddenly a ceratin action couldn't be triggered to free a character out of prison. Which pretty much forces you to restart the game again to get to that point. Which i didn't do.   Overall, It's a pretty alright RPG maker game. Would i recommend it?Yes, pretty sure an error wont happen to everyone, it might have not been an error from the side of the game but rather an error in my playthrough.Maybe you should give it a shot.

Product received for free
-Quick Review-Legend of Mysteria is an RPGMaker game developed by Labyrinthine and released Oct 9, 2015.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Legend of Mysteria is a prequel to the Labyronia RPG games. You play as Windir (an air mage) who has been framed for murdering Dinyon (a prestigious Fire Mage ""demi-god""). I dare say 90% of this game is puzzle solving, and 10% of this game is reloading saves and trying your RNG against bosses, and weather to use items or not.


Screenshot 2 - Uploaded for review 
Community Created Artwork for Legend of Mysteria
By: Atratzu

			....yet another screenshot which really doesn't add anything, just showing the three characters who join your team.		


Gameplay: Unlike the Labyronia games, this game emphasizes story telling and puzzle solving. (which at the time I'm writing this I was grateful for, because I'm currently RPGmaker-combat-exhausted.)However everytime you actually get into battle you realize just how annoying it would have been to battle more often. This time there is no combat given for battling... but thankfully once you defeat a foe it does not respawn or come back when you leave the screen. There are also zero random encounters.As I've already said most of the game is completing puzzles, I played for about 2 or 3 hours before getting discouraged and looking up a guide.(Props to karinms for the guide btw, I would have given up after hitting the wall without it.

A Guide for Legend of Mysteria

			My walkthrough is pretty much finished. There's a path to the good end of the game (with mentions of the bad end) but this follows my playthrough so things can happen differently from your own playthrough.		


  )I'm not very good at puzzle solving in general, but this was the first RPG maker game I've ever played which emphasized on story telling and puzzle solving rather then combat level grinding.

Conclusion: I can definitely say this much: Labyrinthine always tries in each game made. The driving factor seems to be for creating a world, and I can respect that.There's also a clear sense of effort and work put into each of Labyrinthine's games.The only problem is that they're stunted and held back by being constrained to the RPGmaker model... Most people have seen all the sprites in other RPG maker games ""We've danced this dance"".I hope that this series becomes a springboard for the developer to create something new outside of RPG maker.In conclusion to answer the question ""should you play this or not"": Have you played many RPG maker games? Do you like puzzles? Do you like reading? If so this game will work for you.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=880604169The final factor or motivator I can think of would be for people going for steam trading cards, or 100% achievers... Thanks to Karinms guide the achievements and game can be played for a minimalist amount of time.... however those motivations are at your own discretion.Clearly, I was motivated by the story and achievements. (Seeing as I got discouraged and followed a guide after the first hour. For what it's worth I can say I cleared maybe a third of the game on my own! I could figure out a lot without the guide... and didn't even go in the same order, but yeah, no, I'm just trying to salvage my pride.)			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												One of the most incredible stories I've ever seen.For a guy who is new to the Labyronia Saga, I had fun with it. This game is not much like a fighting type game (you have only more than 3 to 5 fights required throughout the game, others you can take just for fun), but instead it is a kind of puzzle, you need to do some Actions to proceed in the game.It seems this story is the legend of ""the hero of Labyronia,"" so for many peoplel those individuals are well known, some people will say that the story is not worth it, others will love it, as for me I really loved everyone secrets and twists. It's a short game, but if it was big would ruined the whole point of the game and the price is very good. The story is complex, but easy to explain. You are Windir, an air mage in a tower full of other mages of different types and the head mage was murdered in front of everyone when he talked about changing things and you were framed for it. You have figured out how to escape and disguise to pass unknown by the other mages while you try to solve the murder to clear your name. From that, things happen, you realize that the old man was right, many things WILL change, and you collect evidence and more to find the guilty and prove your self as innocent.The gameplay is as good as a RPGMaker might be, at some points you need to be very precise with the items you need to have, the timming and (which really bothered me a lot) the specific locations to use these items. This actually buggy me a few times, for example a candle where you can interact with more than one side (right, up, down, left) you can light it (with the specified item) from just one side; Another example was a switch on a statue between statues ... if your game is a bit buggy (as mine was in some spots) or you get to feel up a little tired, you can lose a lot easily, and this is a pain.

												Loved this game with all its twist and turns - it is not a fast and easy game as you need to seek out all the clues to be able to proceed - there is no leveling or upgrades of weapons - just skills and brainpower - you will need to collect all the books,notes etc to understand and decypher the outcome- many of the characters are the forerunners of the later  series so players of the other games will be familiar with them- definitely a great game to play- would highly recommend			",24,109,0,18,0,0,0

Review Upon Legend Of Mysteria RPGWritten by Rias GremoryProsThis game isn't really my type of game, but I enjoyed playing the first couple of 'hours' of the game, I have seen not really any problems, there are not really many tips, so you will have to find your own, The art style is very dark and 'pixely' but I can see through that and enjoy the game play, the HUD is easy to use and extremely simple, like no joke. The game isn't all that fast paced, but it has small animal fights like pokemon, (seen in the trailer on steam store) of which I do feel is a bit cheap of them to do, but that is their game...ConsI was unable to get the feel of the game, even after playing like 16 hours of it. I found it hard to follow the story due to the lack of information on the steam store page, and really just all over the internet. I seemed to run really fast when going sideways as well, I noticed the fact that you can go faster going left or right on your keyboard than going forward or backwards (evening this out would make a heavy difference. Overall I did find a lot of the start to be a bit silly, and not really immersive, but I would still play the game.Overall ReviewGiving the fact that the game lacks in the immersive story telling, and the fact that it is just like a lot of other cheap basic RPG games, I would still find a way for me to play it, and have fun, whether this being hacking (Item mods) or possibly even messing with game files, I would be able to spend my time playing this sky view RPG game. I would not reccomend this game to those who hate story lacking games, but if you wish to try it, then feel free. There is not really much I can say about this game, as I have not really completed it.Extra InformationDeveloper(s): LabyrinthinePublisher(s): EQ GamesPlatform(s): WindowsRelease Date: October 9th 2015Source(s)Personal ExperienceSteam Store PageGoogleWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group	 ",166,41,7,17,13,3,13

												This is a murder mystery, puzzle rpg.You are Windir a wind mage and you have been blamed for a murder, find out who did it.This game has really good music, but no volum controll in game, it is set to loud so being in skype at the same time isen't as plesant as it could be and some of the music seems missplaced.The grafics aren't anything great, but it is ok. The faces are well made, but alot of the characters have to share the same facial stuckture with too few differences. Windir looks kind of evil to be honest.You don't earn experience or levels from fighting and the fighting system isen't any good. You see the enemy infront of you and you don't see your own team. You can (Guard), (Attack), use (Item) or use (Magic). The spells you have depends on the equipment you have on. You have healing items, mana items and a late game revival item to use in fights.Some of the puzzles are really fun to solve, but if you are like me then most of them will be done by following a guide since it is so hard to know what item to click on who and so on.This game has 6 acheivements, badges, card drops and is sold for a low price, so if this sounds like something for you then go for it.Have fun, enjoy and solve the mystery :)			",101,41,0,14,6,1,6

												This RPG is one I can see myself finishing, one day.Whenn you consider that this game is as cheap as it is, you cannot argue that this is amongst the best you will get for lower than £1. Story is challenging but not impossible, and this game will give you hours upon hours of gameplay should you wish to complete it once starting.I would recommend that you DON'T look up guides on YouTube or whatever if you get stuck, but rather, try everything possible.

It will expand the lore concerning the elves of Nuterra (the Earth world from Labyronia Elements), and should offer another challenging adventure in the vein of Legend of Mysteria.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Legend of Mysteria is a RPG game which you are a man acused of murder. Your mission is to prove you are innocent and you must figure out who is the real killer. The history is good, you get involved with the invesgation. The game is colorful, what can annoy you.You basically have the same weapons almost the entire game, I finished the game with 2 weapons and 4 clothes (if I'm not wrong). But to be fair you do not need to fight so much in this game, so I can understand why there are just this quantity of armaments. To find some things you need to explore all the places one by one again and again, what makes you irritated, it seems like a merry-go-round. The puzzles of the game aren't simple, which means you can get stuck in a part for a long time (or just go on the internet and search to a way to pass it). I took a couple of hours to finish this game, it wasn't hard, but it wasn't easy either.The end of the story surprised me, I was not expecting for what happened, so I got happy with the ending.The price is pretty cheap, I'd recommend you to buy and try out.

												Legend of Mysteria is a murder mystery RPG set in the Labyronia Universe. Chronologically, it is a prequel to those two games. So, the plot starts basically as someone kills the Leader of the Council of Mages. You need to find the killer. Oh, did I mention you've been framed for the deed?Gameplay is simple enough, though the few fights can go bad against you. Randomness of the damage output can really crimp your style.

												Legend of Mysteria is an RPG Maker made RPG set as a prequel to another game in their series by the same author. Though it's made via RPG Maker, it has a different feel to it rather than the typical RPG maker made game for better and for worse.This game is about the main character Windir, whom you get accused of murder and have to prove you innocence. It's mainly about exploring your locations, talking to NPC's, gathering evidences, finding and using items to unlock new and previously locked rooms and area. It has an intruging story that kept me lingering and not much of a combat system (which isn't a minus), but has a very confusing and uninformative use of items to progress the story.At the start it's interesting enough to read all the documents and uncover clues to find out who framed you, but then it becomes a nightmare of finding objects and find where you are supposed to use them, some of which I had no idea how you where supposed to find out the solution without a walkthough.There is not nearly enough tips in the game as of how to use certain items, for example, how are you supposed to know Djinni is able to spy on people if you put its crystal in a nearby ""cup"" or ""bucket""? How are you supposed to know which object corresponds to which crystal in the corridor of elements to get the tome of elements? How are you supposed to know which documents you are supposed to use on different people to get to the next point in the game? There's a plethora of items to use and not much information to let you know when or where to use it and with whom.Pros:+ Windir's story, the plot is very good+ Crime investigation+ Combat system is very simplistic and not often used, which is nice for a investigation styled RPG+ Lack of a love story, it's short and abrupt which isn't very expectedCons:- Really hard puzzles & quests (time-consuming to find the correct person/place/object you're supposed to interact with and how)- A lot of backtrackingTL;DR:6.5/10For an RPG Maker made game it's very well done, one of the better RPG Maker games I've played, and I've played quite a few of them. It's mostly a criminal investigation style game with some rare instances where you have to use combat, mostly just interactions. Complicated use of items to progress the story so if you really wanna get this game done and over with fast (less than 10 hours) I'd strongly suggest using a guide.

												*Sigh* It seems a positive review score really is meaningless when it comes to RPGM games.  This one, while far from the worst, suffers from poor writing - and I'm not just referring to the occasional grammatical error or bizarre utterances like ""I could try and lure my fingers under the door"".  The plot is overly contrived (e.g., when the summary says you are framed for a murder, what it means is that the victim is killed openly in a room full of witnesses and then the murderer claims that you hired him with his dying breath, and everyone just says ""Well, this guy seems trustworthy""), and the world-building comes in the form of a series of infodumps that somehow manage to be brief and rambling at the same time, failing to explain anything very clearly and sometimes giving apparently contradictory info.  I don't think I'll bother giving the rest of the series a chance.			",342,170,8,99,29,5,60

												Wasn't into the story. The game was sort of marketed as a JRPG but it didn't have that feel. It was 50 cents in a bundle so no great loss.			",30,1,0,6,1,0,22

												This is a really intriguing yet fun game. Makes you read the books and collect items to progress through the story. You do have to be careful in some areas since it's very easy to mess up the game and have to revert to an older save or start over. I had to use a guide to see where I got stuck at. I'll give this game a 9.5/10. Would defiantly play it again.			",218,35,9,43,17,3,31

												Legend of Mysteria Review - Raymond KTLegend of Mysteria is a RPG game which you are a man acused of murder. Your mission is to prove you are innocent and you must figure out who is the real killer. The history is good, you get involved with the invesgation. The game is colorful, what can annoy you. Legend of Mysteria is a spin-off from the Labyronia RPG series and story wise a prequel. While there are a lot of familiar characters and the main area of the game is the so called Mysteria Tower, the story can be enjoyed on it's own, without any prior knowledge. However if you have played Labyronia RPG 1 and 2, Legend of Mysteria will give some nice additional insights. The main storyline, the murder of a high rank mage called Dinyon and Windir (the player character) trying to clear his name, while being accused of being the man behind the dirty deed, is a very well put together detective story that will keep you guessing until pretty late who the true culprit is.I love classic style RPGs but for some strange reason the ones here on Steam I just can’t get into that much. The game isn’t bad, I just can’t recommend it ",106,29,6,13,24,1,11

												I received this product for free.I really wanted to recommend this game, since I did the first two games. But, it's nothing like the first two. There are hardly any battles or leveling to worry about. While the story isn't necessarily hard to follow, having to piece together a murder mystery through written notes (especially some that are hard to read), left me with not knowing who the killer was at the end.Also, another terrible, forced love story.4/10			",99,63,0,23,20,0,9

Note: CD-Key was provided by Publisher.Legend of Mysteria is much more about crime investigation rather than just mindless JRPG where you kill everything on sight. In this game you start of one of mages who is accused of murder in order to solve this mystery you have to search for clues, interact with objects and other NPCs, which isnt a bad thing to be honest,The Good:- Pixelated grahpics and visuals,- Enjoyable music,- Story,- Crime investigationThe Bad:- Can't acceess to steam overlay nor take screenshots,- No idea where to go and what to do, easy to get lost in other words you are on your own, everything depends on your memorization,- During combat you can't see enemies hp which is bad (at least i didnt noticed anywhere)FYI, this is early review as i just spent 1.6 steam hours in it, this review will be edited at some point.

												MURDER! in Labyronia!? in Mysteria tower, Dinyon the head of council has been murderd, shot by an arrow during a meeting of the mages !( rather personal if you ask me) Windir our favorite Labyronia mage is back, but hes been framed for the murder. In this Clue like game, discover the vile plot and who the  true killer is, by escaping your prison and scouring the Mysteria tower for clues and suspects. A great change of pace from the RPG maker games , this is one for the mystery Scooby Doo fans. Very much did I actually want to see how everything plays out . Collecting and pretty much on ''high alert'' about everything, do you go through the game trying to figure out what happend. Picking up and finding items and when/ where to use them is key to the game.  ''Does that plant pot over there have a key hidden in it?''  kinda thing.You pick up some comrades and friends ( even a lil dragon) and try to clear Windir's name. A smart gameplay too with disguises to get by and trick guards and fellow mages. Try if you like the Labyronia games and want to try a rather well done JRPG.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												Quite the interesting little rpg game where you wonder around looking for clues and doing some favors in order to clear your name and find the real culprit of a muder. A lot of cryptic puzzles but all is written in the community guide if you're ever stuck and don't know what to do.			",17,82,0,13,19,0,2

												Alright... This was probably the most boring RPG I've ever played.There's unfortunately no ""Adventure"" in this game. It's a simple, go here fetch this, go there deliver that games with a plot that's more boring than watching ""Man of Steel"".There's about 5 fights in the entire game as well as no levelling up 2 different weapons and 3 set characters.This game is really chaotic and I don't recommend approaching it without a guide so here's mine.>Open the game>Open google>Search for ""Legend of Mysteria RPG save file"" >Download a save file right before the ending of the game>Load the file>Be just as confused as to what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on as you would, if you'd devoted 8 hours to the game.>Uninstall the game and delete local content, so that you will never come by any game files and have a vietnam flashback, due to the terror this game caused youSo my overall rating is:10/10 it's a masterpiece ",70,26,2,11,7,1,2

												To all you JRPG Fans out here, I know this Isn't Chrono Trigger level of quality, but the problem its not that this is an RPG Maker Game, The problem is the developement felt very lazy thus this very low price It's very short and even still will make you feel bored from the start of the game. It Also runs poorly. Dear developers please don't see the JRPG genre as a effortless cash-in, we very much expect a story rich indie rpg game with some new mechanics.  Pick this up only for the steam trading cards, it's not really worth playing it unless only for the achievements.			",101,8,2,10,8,0,7

												I have always been a big fan of the Labyronia series and am finding this game very enjoyable.  It is very much different from the other Labyronia games (Labyronia I & II) as it relies more on exploration and discovery.  One of my favorite parts of this game are the many secret tunnels and rooms that are available to be discovered as well as the ""open-world"" feeling the game delivers.  The only con I found for this game is the lack of fighting that occurs, as previous Labyronia games had alot of fighting and battles.  So far, I have found this game very enjoyable and worth the price.         ",51,1,0,1,0,0,3

I have recieved this game for free as part of a promotion for the game. Regardless of whether I paid for it or not, I remain unbiased in all of my reviews. My reviews reflect my opinion, and my opinion only.Something something powerful crystal, something something dark lord, something something RPG Maker.I want to become engrossed in these games, I really do, but it's really hard to do when you see recycled materials used over and over again. I imagine it's really fun when you get into it, but I just done care what's happening anymore. I can't become immersed when I'm staring at the same scene with walls of text explaining the back story. If I wanted to play a game based on a light novel I would just read the novel. I couldn't even get into the combat, I was lost at the beginning. The music is pretty good though, from what I heard, but it was awkwardly misplaced...  It's like, two dollars though. That's like, the price of a soda, or a couple hamburgers from the dollar menu, so save yourself the diabetes and heart disease, try one of these things out and you'll see what I mean.

I couldn't get into the game after a while, and just went straight guide to get the achievements and beat the game.Achievement Quest:  Easy to get the 100%, just follow a guide and you are good.

												I've only played about 20 minutes so far, but I found what I played entertaining. Murder mystery plots are pretty fun. I also like how the start of this game isn't all about some hero going out to save the land like a lot of RPG maker games.Player Two and myself game some commentary to the first 20 minutes we played and will upload it to our channel on YouTube (Hidden Level) if anyone would like to see what it is like before purchasing.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another great addition to the Labyronia series and it is enjoyable to see parts of the world before the events of the first game transpired.  Though I enjoyed the plots of the first and second Labyronia RPG better, this story is not bad and it is neat to see the game move away from a combat focus by removing the leveling system.I love the characters and felt a deeper attachment to them, especially with the knowledge of what will happen, and greatly recommend that if you are interested in playing this game than play Labyronia RPG 1 and 2 first.  That way, I believe, you’ll have a deeper interest and better understanding of the world and those in it. ",165,79,1,49,26,2,33

												A more interesting RPG where you search for clues and do favors for others not because you are going for ""the good ending"" but because you are searching for the actual culprit and you have to clear your name.This one has more interesting puzzles and some situations turn quite interesting. A little touch of Sherlock Holmes (a little as I said) give this game a nice atmosphere and a more interesting story than the classic save the world RPG.			",198,24,7,35,7,2,34

												An excellent example of how creativity can build an amazing game out of an engine renown for bad RPGs like RPG maker. Combat is almost nonexistant, and frankly what little combat there is i found greatly dragged down the pace of the game. This is a murder mystery. Prepare to spend hours combing through every drawer, trashcan, and NPC you can find trying to find clues and puzzle pieces to keep the story going. At the beginning you are a prisoner charged with the crime of killing the king. To prove your innocence you set out a fugitive running around the castle trying to piece together information about the other possible killers and figuring out what happenned. The world is really built up and if you're willing to take the time and read all the books there is some really good stories in here. You get a really good idea through reading about the warring factions and groups, possible murder suspects and some of the waves the political struggle goes through. The grammer can have issues but untimately i got really into the story and the world, and i think it helps a lot that for 90% of the game there are no combat scenarios. Most of the game is through puzzle solving that makes use of the books and information you have similar to how a point and click game works. It's not what i normally expect seeing the RPGmaker tag.Admittedly some of the solutions are extremely contrived. At one point I needed an item from a cloaked wizard, who said he would help me if i found out what happenned to a girl named Indra. Turns out INdra hangs out in a cell in the prison, but when you talk to her she doesn't actually say her name. You just go back to the hooded guy and your character says he met with Indra in the jaul cell, but she never said her name and i can't tell where else we would have that information. Little things like that pop up everynow and again and it makes a walkthrough extremely neccessary to play the game (taking a bit of the fun out of it IMO). Also towards the end the game starts to really drag on as you encounter a barn and a labrynth with monster encounters. It's not a dealbreaker but it did annoy me that the appeal of the game - murder mystery puzzle solving - had been replaced by the most basic rpgmaker mechanics i had played so many times before.All in all though it's still a very cool game that makes really good use of the rpgmaker toolkit to do something unique and pretty fun.

Legend of Mysteria is a detective type of game in an RPG setting. Your main objective is to gather evidence to prove your innocence and indict the real perpetrator. If you're the curious kind of player who checks out every chest, item, location and NPCs in a game, then this is for you. Have unlimited patience? Perfect. This game is actually well done. But i have to downvote it. Why?- I just didn't enjoy playing this game. It has been a frustrating eight-hour experience! This game is like a hallway or NPC simulator. You have to go back and forth the same halls, the same NPCs the same rooms the same everything just to try out if they will react to whatever item you have found. - The game also introduces a bunch of names, like you literally have to note them down only to find out in the end that Ooops! This game is actually a prequel or sequel or whatever of another game. Why didn't anyone from the dev team indicate that on the description? - The flirtation between Windir and Triste is just terribly awkward! It felt unnecessary and unnatural. That kiss scene was cringeworthy. - And the card drop. WTH man. I know it's randomly generated but i received 3 Dinyon cards in a row. Seriously? I'm just so disappointed and frustrated with this game. I cant even			",76,48,2,9,12,1,8

What I got was a fun detective style game with a decent plot. Worth it's first playthrough, but almost no replay value. One thing to note, there are aspects of the game that are not obvious at all.

												Played Labyronia I and II and having played this, I enjoyed the story plot that ties in all three games together. This game differs drastically from the other two games in that you aren't exactly geared towards fighting monsters to level up. Rather, you are mostly on a hunt-seek to solve a mystery. Much like modern click and search games, this is like that, but in JRPG format, where you move everywhere, click everywhere, and try different actions with different characters. This may not be for everyone considering the amount of patience and memorization you have to have to perform certains actions. IE: immense backtracking to get an item back you didn't realize you needed or remembering which note/diary to pull up in front of a character. What was nice is that any monsters you killed previously does not respawn. With  the amount of backtracking at the later parts of the game, I appreciated this fact so I didn't have to re-kill all the monsters as I went back and forth.About the gameplay, it is somewhat linear in that you can progress in slightly different paths, but they all converge down to the same ending when you reach the end of that part. IE: you can complete one side quest before the other. Fight scenes are pretty rudimentary RPG mechanics. Not the best, but not the worse either. Some of the puzzles can stump you for awhile. I enjoyed solving them and even had to use a guide to figure out a few. One downside to the game is the vast amount of items you have. As noted earlier, you need to have a good memory or you will repeatedly scroll through your items trying to figure out which item goes to whom. I played the game without pausing too much inbetween so I had a decent rememberance of each item, but if you play the first few hours and then come back after a week or longer, you may struggle trying to remember everything. For a mystery RPG, there is a LOT of things to be found and to use. A few might even say too many, but considering the story plot, it does kind of make sense as to why there are so many items. Overall, it's a nice game to play. I did end up using the guide for the last 1/4 of the game, but I was progressing pretty quickly in the game in that I don't think I'd reach 10 hours of gameplay. 7.5/			",52,13,0,4,0,0,1

												Ugh...  guess if I played a bunch of games like this then might know what actions I am expected to take. I ended up giving up. What information that is given has grammer problems. One mechanic only seems to be used right at the start and feels like a needless puzzle, a certain spell doesn't seem to be used until well after getting it, and there is a mechanic that didn't seem to be explained well at all so I ended up being locked out of an area because I no idea what was happening. Basically, make an important choice based on information gathered from various locations and figure out that some lore is actually directions for solving a puzzle.			",51,13,0,29,5,0,23

												On the whole, i've been happy with this.The story is for the most part, very well thought-out. It only suffers from being a little complex, not knowing which pieces of literature to use when and where, and a few grammatical hiccups:""despite of ..."" rather than ""In spite of ..."" which lets it down a bit.The story is a bit mishmash too, but pleasantly executed. I didn't like feeling so helpless in battles - there's nothing to make you stronger from levelling up - and healing can only be done via potions (with a severe shortage of money in-game) and the fountain AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME. This means that you might get yourself in a sticky situation (like if triste dies) and have to teleport (love the teleporting spells btw) all the way back to the beginning and at best, have to walk back to Albion from Triste's adoptive father's house after re-warping to Labyronia.I strongly suggest making ALL fountains able to heal the party (and putting a note so players know). This would make the fountain in the lower right of Albion and the small fountain at the right of the elven town able to revive and heal everyone back up to full.Definitely one of those RPGs suited for players who like to try everything on everything, hoping for something new to happen!
