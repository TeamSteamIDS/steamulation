												I took a quick look at Ghost Machine`s latest game Gumball Drift, and i did enjoy this very much. Table top games makes for a fun experience in VR. I still feel the game needs more objectives. maybe this will come in a future update.Here is my video :

			Let`s take a look at Gumball Drift ! Its a neat little table top arcade racer, made for Virtual Reality. Just like having your own personal little RC race track.

												Great game for VR that's tabletop-style presentation prevents any form of motion sickness. As someone who needs to activate nearly all comfort settings for most games, I can greatly appreciate how easy this game is on me.There are 10 different race tracks with 20 different vehicles; many of which must be unlocked. Thanks to that this game has a lot of staying power and keeps pulling me back for more. Dozens of environmental hazards and power-ups kept me engaged during the race, and dominating other racers feels extremely satisfying. There's a multiplayer option, but sadly there aren't enough people playing right now in order to give it a fair rating. Hopefully once people recieve more of their headsets and as VR takes off I'll be able to play the multiplayer with others! A local multiplayer option would also be an amazing addition. One issue I had with the game is it loaded me in very close to the ground, and it was difficult to see the track. It turns out the solution to this was setting up SteamVR in its seated/standing experience. I use the Oculus so I was unaware of how to use SteamVR, but once I got through that issue the game was a lot of fun and I'll continue to be returning for more. I can only imagine how fun it would be to have a Vive and walk all over the track!			",223,30,2,16,14,1,12

												I wan't sure that I would like this controller game, becuase in VR everything else is standing and running around. It turns out that I like sitting and playing VR even better!  This game is like an arcade racer, where you see the entire track layed out before you and it seems to take up your entire room. You can get up and walk around the track, is down in the infield and watch the cars race around, its pretty cool. The AI is pretty good, while at first it was too easy, I just changed the difficulty to hard and after I did that, the races were super challenging. There is a mutliplayer option as well, but I did not spend any time playing that yet, ive mostly just played single player.			",4,4,3,1,2,0,1

												This looked so good on the store page. But it was disapointing on many fronts. The concept is great, somewhere between micro machines and having one of those electric toy race tracks. The VR perspective looking down on toy like race cars you control works really well. There is of course no reason it needs to be VR exclusive, the camera could easily be bound to the right analog stick allowing non-VR onwers to join in. It's all down hill from there too.  I loaded it up and went straight into options, where sound was defaulted to off and virtually impossible to adjust because attmepting to adjust the volume sliders moves you to next option in the menu. I later found out the volume sliders only affect the main menu and even with sound off the the music at the start of the race will blow out your ear drums. I bought it primarily because it's one of the few Vive enabled games listed to have multiplayer. So talking to a friend in teamspeak we loaded up the game, and clicked online. Immediately we were taken into a race track. First thing we noticed was dispite the game not using the vive controllers, they still floated visably above the race track blocking the view until we physicaly moved them out of the way. Next we noticed we were both alone. We were just thrown into two empty games displite connecting at the same time.Turns out connecting at the same time was the problem. If one of us went into the online mode and waited by themself for the race to start then the other one of us joined, then the second player got to join in on the race in progress. Just to clarify, there is no lobby of any sort. You click online and you just get thrown in a game if one is there. So the only way to play multiplayer with my friend was to join them in a race that already started, so they could be halfway around the track before I got in if they wanted (we were of course gentlefolk about it).That where it got really stupid. The multiplayer games last 4 laps... You'd think that means first to do 4 laps wins... Nope, it means cars can cross the starting line 4 times. All cars collectively. So if we were neck and neck the whole way around, the game would last 2 laps (about 30 seconds). No winners no losers. The 4th time a car goes over the starting line the game just ends and both players get kicked out to... The map select menu for the single player campaign mode. Which you then have to back out of to go back to multiplayer again. Which btw will be on the same map every single time.Pretty much everything about the menu interface is broken. Multiplayer while technically existant, is completely broken. The single player campaign mode is where the most work seems to be put and it's passable at times, but just passable. I know it's early access but a lot of work needs to be done to polish this up to something worth selling and once it is it still needs more content to justify the listed pricetag.I suggested to my friend we refund the game and go get Toybox turbos for a quarter the price. It was a much better investment.			",780,278,26,168,152,13,154

												I'm giving Gumball Drift a recommendation but with provisions.  Please read before you buy and please note I am using the HTC Vive.The premise of the game is simple and exactly what you see in the description. Playing the game however is nothing like the previous arcade racers this is baced upon but more akin to racing radio controlled cars...and it works well to a degree.  The usual power ups and earn cash to unlock better cars is there. The tracks whilst basic in some respects are enough to kepp you on your toes. Visually it's basic cartoon style graphics, very much akin to games from 10 years ago but it is rendered  brightly and clearly within your VR enviroment  and seated or standard gameplay (or both) poses no issues. I could as much sit down to race my cars as I could stand up and walk around my play area. In fact it some cases it was preffrable to stand up and move. My only issue here was that there is no reset view, which whilst not problematic was annoying when you wanted to play seated but had to stand up (and turn my back to my PC) and move just to get a better view. Please add a reset button devs...or at least make it clear where the reset view option is if it's implemented (I could not find it).A huge bonus for this game is also the fact that the dreaded VR sickness is a complete non issue in this game. However, there are 2 big elephants in this VR room. First and formost is the lack of support for the Vives motion controllers (and I suspect future Rift Touch controllers). This could just as easily be capable of controlling the cars but the support simply isnt there. If you do not own a game pad, you cant play.  The second is the price of this title. I bought it in the Steam sale and paid £8.99 (down from £14.99).  This is not a £15 game in my opinion, even taking the VR part into account (so pick it up on sale).  Not a bad game at all (lot of fun infact) but for the stanard price I'd recommened plenty of other games over this (at least in the case of Vive owners).  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprised that there are not more top down racers like this in VR because it works so well. I like the tiny toon style cars, it riminds me of when I would like with slot cars or hotwheels. At first the races were too slow, but after I made the change in options to 'hard' setting it was perfect. I've speant a few hours already playng this, but I hevent even unlocked half of the cars and tracks yet, so there is quite a bit of content i have still to keep playing.			",7,5,3,1,2,0,1

Would love it if there were more players for the multiplayer mode becuase I think it would be awesome in multiplayer. ",6,3,2,1,2,0,1

												I can't figure out the controls to the game, there is no ""controls"" section in the menus either.I'm using SCP server to get my ps4 controller working on it, it basically emulates a 360 gamepad and works on every other game.EDIT: Also doesn't work with steam controller.

												Waste of $20. I downloaded the game for my son and as soon as I started it up, it was offcenter and can't be full screened or adjusted so you can't see whats going on. All you can see is a tractor literally in front of the main menu. And then if you can figure out how to accidentally start the game you play the whole game from a fixxed position behind a crash wall barrier. Like I said, worst waste of $20 I've ever done in my life. And I once bought my own♥♥♥♥♥♥back from a thief once.			",8,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun game but it is buggy. I have purched the $35,000 car twice now. Only to have it Locked the next time I log in and all that cash is gone both times... Other than that is is a fun little racing game. Maybe a bit steep on the asking priced considered it is not as polished as I would have hoped.HTC Vive			",256,63,8,11,45,4,7
