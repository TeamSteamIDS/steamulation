												I found Off-Road Super Racing to be a pretty decent Off-Road Racing game. It was an unexpected find for a free to play release and I recommend anyone interested check it out.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

												Don't bother.   Terrible physics, no instructions or abiliity to customoze the control (you can't even change the keys for input), and ok graphics.   I actually think the vehicle speeds up when in a skid and you can't correct you way out of it.  Very difficult to even stay on the road, let alone pass any other vehicleIt's free so no harm, no fowl.  Sorry, but I found nothing enjoyable, cute, funny, or entertaining in this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe i didnt give it enough time but i attempted at least 15 races and it seems stupidly difficult.I enjoy games with a good amount of difficulty as it feel more of an achievement when you finally achieve something however this is a free quick racer and i havn't been able to win one race yet.Alot of people complain about the controls. I dont think they are bad. Only took 2 races to get used to them however the AI's trucks just seem to be much faster!I'm happy to accept that I might just be rubbish at it! I don't really play racers.I can see the appeal for the game and I think if you are willing to try and try and try because you really love racing games then give it ago. But for me, i just don't want to try the same race 100 times to win............................................A little bit more about game play. For a free game i actually enjoyed the graphics and the tracks are nice. There seemed to be quite a few different ones and i only tried 4-5.Vehicles custimation looks cool and you need to unlock it by progressing through the 'impossible' Championship mode :)There are two modes free race i think it was and championship mode which had roughly 20-30 races...............................................Summary: I guess i could give it more time, i like the customisation and the graphics are ok. I just cannot be bothered to try and try again!feel slightly harsh not recommending it now because it isnt terrible......			",103,32,3,25,18,0,28

												Well, you get what you pay for. This is yet another P.O.S. Unity ""Personal Edition"" racing game. I am baffled at how these keep showing up on Steam. No proper settings, no controller support, graphics look like garbage (Think PS2 if I'm being generous) and the physics make me think this game is supposed to be happening on some other planet where the gravity is turned on and off at random. I'm guessing any positive reviews were written by (or paid for by) the creator of this ""game"". Don't waste your time.			",708,202,48,120,94,13,117

												I can see why people might like this game but it's too much random physics for me. Hit one bump and you go flying! Good luck trying to catch up. The track design is nice though.I made a video:

												Off-Road Super Racing gameplay is amazingly quick, visually stunning, and very immersive. Perhaps easier to control than many other Steam racing games - at last - I think this is my favorite racing game for some time.  Well worth the play!Make up your own mind with this gameplay:

												SYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: OS: 7, 8, 8.1, 10 DirectX: Version 9.0That's a damn lie. I have a FirePro V4800 1GB GDDR5 card, Using a Xeon Quad 3220 2.4ghz, 4GB DDR3 memory and the game runs like hell stuttering at 30fps. Pros+Graphics are not bad at allCons-Everything elseBad controlsGame is demanding, yea that's funny i know.GameTop has some fun games, this isn't one of them. If they added real gamepad support and fix the graphic engine, it wouldn't so be so bad.			",160,21,7,42,9,0,19
