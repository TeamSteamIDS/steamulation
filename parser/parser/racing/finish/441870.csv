												Is this a joke? The description of the game is longer the actual game.All you do is seriously drive around one track for as long as you can without any obstacles other than the occasional roadblock with a ramp and a gunship that spawns every 8 minutes getting in the way. That's it. That's the whole game. The bullets don't even do anything! They're not even a threat! All they do is make the road randomly spawn debris in your face which comes with no warning. There's no other hazards... just hard turns, roadblocks and a gunship. Pitiful.The only good thing this game has going for it is a nice aesthetic and some pretty good music. $3 for literally 8 minutes of gameplay... 13 if you actually can make one full lap without falling asleep. Literally get the ♥♥♥♥ out. Perhaps I'm being harsh on, say, a college student's final project for school but this isn't something you charge people for. Nitronic Rush was a final project for school and that had more content and was released free. This is a 99 cent mobile game AT BEST. Also, don't copy Powerdrive 2000. You're not Powerdrive 2000. And you're not going to ride off it's kickstarter success.If you want a game with more in-depth gameplay and content check out Distance (the same team who made Nitronic Rush).UPDATE 2/26: DENVER has recently updated the game's description to say this game was created just for the sake of music in order to save face. Yes, the music is decent, but don't be fooled, the game is stil garbage. Do not fall for it.			",468,64,27,26,22,3,31

												OutDrive, in one way, is an amazing achievement, and DENVER has a lot to be proud of with their creation. I mean that. The screenshots simply do not do this game any level of justice, as there's actually a lot of varied scenary to keep things fresh and thus never feels like the ""empty sunset highway"" some people have voiced concern over before buying. The combination of audio/visual elements delivers THE best 80's/neon/VHS/vaporwave experience I've ever seen in a video game, hands down.There is so much attention put into everything, from the tastefully low polygon count on most of the assets, to the bloom that glows softly off of the neon and the post-processing filter across the screen, it all ensures that this game feels like a 3D interactive vaporwave poster art. As a work of art, it's meticulously crafted and feels SO good to play for the first few minutes. Alas, the art style is not the aforementioned achievement displayed in this product, because it's just ripping off of the upcoming Kickstarter-funded game Power Drive 2000. Seriously, look up some screenshots and try not to feel insulted on behalf of PD2k's developers. Even if you're someone who's really into the whole vaporwave/vhs aesthetic, this game is not worth the price of admission as it's just a petty clone/cashgrab feeding itself off of the Power Drive hype. I want to make it clear that I do not hate this game for not being Power Drive, because I had no idea what Power Drive was until after I  played this game and read some of the user reviews. I have zero attachment to that project, and my opinion is not in comparison to that game, but how the game stands on its own merit in a world where it was actually an original idea.The problem with OutDrive is that, beyond stimulating your eyes and ears, there is NOTHING left. At its most basic level, the game mechanics are actually quite good, which makes it even more confusing that nothing interesting was done with them. Driting around sharper turns is fun, hitting the ramp between roadblocks is fun, balancing speed with trying not to overheat keeps you engaged as you drive. And yet, absolutely none of these things provide you with any real challenge. My FIRST run in the game lasted 28 minutes and the only reason I stopped was because I was BORED, not because I failed. Despite having a meter that forces you to go fast but not too fast, I spun out, came to a COMPLETE halt, hit the (unlimited) boost, and was back on my way without penalty. It's borderline insulting. There are so many great ideas here that just don't do anything meaningful. If you're driving through a city (which looks ♥♥♥♥ing SICK, by the way) you may have to dodge cross-traffic or some of the lanes may have a car driving alongside you. It would have been so easy to use this as an opportunity to challenge the players environmental awareness as they have to watch the road ahead of them, and dodge the cars beside them, and yet these other cars are separated by wide distance, predictable, and easily avoided. Likewise, there is a helicopter that shows up once in a while to fire bullets at you, which literally just bounce off your car when you do get hit, there is no consequence for this whatsoever. Sometimes, the chopper will try missiles instead, which hit the road ahead of you, bringing up chunks of pavement that you may crash into if you're not careful. While these missiles are the hardest part of the game, they are by no means a threat, considering even if you get hit by a big slab of the road and find yourself turned 180 degrees, all you have to do is quickly press that boost, turn around, and you're on your way before your speed meter ever reaches the bottom.If you want to jam out to some downtempo 80's-esque electronic synth music while dining on a visual feast, go for it, but do not expect the game to challenge you in any way. It's an endless runner that somehow screwed up the most necessary part of the genre: losing. And that's one hell of an achievement to be proud of.			",403,121,10,51,33,4,45

												There's a lot to be desired with this game. It's  ""what you see is what you get."" The game is an 80's inspired endless driver, like what you'd might get on the App store honestly. There is not much to the game at all. The driving feels clunky, but really easy to get accustomed to. Unfortunately the game is locked to 30 FPS and makes the quality of the game look even less. The game is priced at $1.79 at the time of writing this (2/22/16), and I can say for this price it's okay, but personally I would not recommend it. You will get a hour or so of playtime out of it and become bored quickly because there isn't much more than what is offered. I can see this game working a lot better on the phone rather than a PC game release. Just 80's and driving.. But hey, if you like the music you're better off just going buying it off the different artists' bandcamps.			",744,176,28,53,67,8,44

												The developer goes out of their way to explain that it's ""not a game, but an aesthetic concept"". Ok, I get that. OutDrive hits a lot of marks - compelling artstyle, pretty great music and it runs well to boot, but in the end it actually is a game in the sense that you need to control a car and keep it between a number limiting factors, namely the road edges and the upper and lower speed limits. Sadly, this part just isn't fun. Devs, if you want me to hear (and potentially buy) your music and you choose to package it in the form of a game, then you'll need to make the game component compelling as well, especially since I'm forced to actively play the game in order to hear the music.

												As the game is now, I cannot recommend it. The gamepad support is broken. You need the boost ability, but it doesn't work with a gamepad. That means after the very cool and promising intro you start the game, and die after 10 seconds. No matter what you do, you always die after exactly 10 seconds. Then you switch to keyboard and realize what was going on. The boost simply doesn't work with the controller. But you need the boost to survive. Ok, so I played a few minutes with the keyboard, but it just didn't feel right. The sensitivity is way off, you're just not able to control the car very well. It feels horribly. The drift is also pretty bad. The game has an interesting idea (keep up the speed or your girl dies), a simple but nice art style, and dynamic, speed-dependent music - but the controls eliminate every bit of enjoyment you might have gotten out of it. If they work on this, it might turn out to be a decent game in the future, though. I will give it another try at some point.			",3246,1239,131,350,409,36,491

												Oh OutDrive where did it all go wrong ?I wanted to like this game I really did, but man it's not worth it, so let's get into it.In OutDrive you play as the Driver. His girlfriend is shot and you hook her up to your Delorean and you have to maintain a certain speed to keep her alive.Drive too slow she dies, drive too fast she dies. The neon visuals and overall the entire design is fantastic, but sadly that's where the good ends and the bad begins.The game is endless and there's no ending what so ever, and to experience everything the map has takes you at least 15 minutes and after that there's nothing else. There are obstacles in the road like road blocks and ramps. There are also random encounters like traffic and a helicopter which shoots at you, but it does absolutely nothing and after a few shots the helicopter explodes.The entire game gets tiring after a few minutes and after that there's nothing to do. The soundtrack is great and is really fun to drive around to listen to the music, but it's not worth to play the game just to listen to the music.I wanted to like this game, I really did, but I can't, my honest recommendation is to wait until Powerdrive 2000 comes out this coming May, Final Rating:3/10 - Don't Bother If you liked this review please consider giving this game a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked.

												DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU INTEND TO USE AN XBOX-360 CONTROLLER.IT IS SIMPLY UNPLAYABLE.If you configure the BOOST function (secondary) to your Controller button, your car will boost forward, but the girl will die. If you use the keyboard it works fine, since it does both, boost and save the girl.If you are trying to put the Acceleration function to the controller trigger, you wont be able to do it on the first Accel option you see, scroll down, and you will see another Accel option, that one will let you do it. The dev, put separate ones for the controller. EXCEPT for BRAKE. There is no way to put Brake on the the other trigger. It will however accept a button on the secondary for the only Brake function on the Control configuration launcher area. BUT NO AXIS FOR BRAKING.X-Box 360 controller needs to be configured before you play. EVERY TIME YOU PLAY.There are no options in-game whatsoever. You have graphics and control settings on the launcher.Graphics Options on the launcher do not save for me. Ever. You need to change it every time you play. SERIOUSLY, EVERY TIME!No Audio Options. NONE.Game does not tell you how to play, as simple as it is, you should at least know what you should do or not do, I kept getting game over after a few seconds even though the car was already quite fast, it was only when I tried to use the keyboard left shift button that I noticed that the key function was bugged on the controller function.  I don't mind unfinished games, I rarely finish most of my games anyway, what I do not like under any circumstance are non-functional games. That's what this is for me. I simply can not play it, regardless of how cheap it is, it should at least work.I was looking forward to playing this, and simply writing a review that says ""This is what you would get if Kung Fury, TopGear and Distance had a Baby!"". The soundtrack alone is fantastic. The concept is really cool too. Hopefully they will add more functionality to the game, some in-game menus (not very hard to do), and just make it playable. Looking forward to when I can delete everything that's written above and just keep that catchy sentence, until then, hold on to your money.			",683,164,33,81,60,4,146

 Overview  OutDrive is a time-based, retro driving game where you must maintain a relatively constant speed in order to keep your girlfriend alive. During the introductory scene, you face off with three unknown assailants with terrible aim, who miss you entirely and strike your girlfriend in the chest. With instructions given from your on-dash computer, you install a makeshift terminal to her heart and drive off into the sunset. End scene.With that being the whole plot of OutDrive, we're left with little else to go by. Now, I can get past a subpar story if the game is well made, but the key, untold aspects of who we are, who those people were and why I can perform heart surgery on a whim are just the beginning. OutDrive is truly a dull, pointless game to play.With no key binding options available, pushing play will start the game immediately, without any formal instructions or direction, nor any prompts telling you what the controls are. You're left with ten seconds to figure it out before you lose and have to restart. Now, restarting isn't a big deal since there is little purpose to starting in the first place; however, once you begin cruising along, your mission is to maintain your high rate of speed to keep your nameless girlfriend alive, keeping the engine running between ""too slow"" and ""too fast"". Driving too slow will kill your girlfriend, driving too fast, in theory, would do the same, but it doesn't. You can hammer down the throttle and suffer no consequences, despite what the game tells you.Driving in OutDrive is cumbersome and feels unnaturally stiff and heavy. Your car flip-flops between feeling like go-kart and a truck with no power steering; hitting curbs or boundaries will cause your heart meter to fade drastically and often send your car flying in a seemingly random direction [if you're lucky you'll crash in the tunnels and clip through the terrain]. After some practice, I was able to control the car appropriately, but after mastering the controls, there wasn't much else do to. The game states the track ""never ends"", which to date nobody can prove otherwise, removing a satisfying ending from the mix; so you're left wandering aimlessly down the track, dodging other vehicles, jumping ramps and taking sharp turns and hoping you run into some fun along the way.On the store page it hints at something interesting at the eight minute mark, stating: ""P.S. Try to hold out for 8 minutes..."", which, once you get there, becomes a major disappointment. A neon helicopter descends from the sky, firing mini guns and rockets, creating the first and only burst of energy the game could muster. However, after 30 seconds the helicopter randomly explodes, leaving just you and your thoughts alone until the next eight minute marker and its inevitable return.The longest I drove was around the 36:00 minute mark before realizing I was just wasting time, expecting entertainment and adventure from a game that has none. As the realization set in and I started to think of everything else I could be doing with my time, I crashed into a wall, died and shut it off. OutDrive does just what it says: it drives you out of the game.   Pros   The music is well done for the most part. There are a few uncomfortably long delays in the tracks sometimes, which can be annoying. Cons    No defined plot of purpose. Major mechanical issues with ""overheating"".  No difficulty progression after the eight minute mark. No key rebinding, no score keeping.Overall, OutDrive is a hollow, shell of what a game really could be; with boring backgrounds, clunky steering, no purpose and no story, OutDrive is nothing more than an 80s mix tape that you listen to while smashing the space button until your fingers hurt.

												First time Run and lasted 22mins is before I couldn't take it any moreThe map is one big track that is roughly 10-15 mins per a lap depending how well u driveThe game gose on for ever . There really is NO challange here. even driving upside down didn't make it amusing.The Default controls is soo bad it cramps the entire left hand.. Trying ot drive with wasd well useing your pinky to hold♥♥♥♥♥♥24/7 and using ya thumb to hold space bar is a massive no.. my pinky couldn't take it any more. Remapping the car controls to the arrows/numpad is a must. And u have to remap buttons and game setting ever time the game loads. They do not save.. I was expect a lot more to be honest.. thought it be a great throw back like OutRun but has nothing like out run.. Like Zero traffic. no real objects to dodge on the road... The helicopter at the end of each lap is boring... There is no reason to drive in any direction ether... you could turn around right at the begging and go the opposite way if you wanted to... (that is untill u hit one of thoses road blocks..)there really is nothing to see here.. put in a single run of 20-30 mins and your see why quite quickAlso the music isn't that rememberable ether.. All in all this is a another cheap Unity3D game with all the unity3D engine issues  inc

												This isn't what I expected at all.ProsSoundtrack is alright. It's got a semi 80s neon vibe to it (It's a shame it gets ruined if you car slows down since it slows down the music which ruins the mood.)ConsDreadful controls with no controller support. (Used an xbox 360 controller and while the steering worked, I couldn't boost no matter what bind I used for the Boost.The plot of simply driving forever until the girl dies isn't exactly exciting or thrilling.It's just a constant loop of the same things with no changes whatsoever.You might think that the price is probably worth the shot but trust me, it isn't. The thing was that this game seems way too similar to another upcoming game and I thought it was this one. Guess I was wrong (The other game I was thinking of was Power Drive 2000).TL:DR - Bad controls, bumpy mechanics and no real plot to it. Only use from it is the soundtrack (Which still isn't 100%)			",1018,352,42,97,86,13,131

Current version April 19th, 2016Going to make this short, You try to make a deal with some people, but the deal went wrong, and those people shot your girl, and your only option to save her is to drive, but to keep her heart pumping is by connecting her to the car accelerator; so if you go to slow she dies, if you go to fast her heart will burst, so you have to keep her heart at a stable rate, that is control by your accelerator.TL:DR: Your girl got in the way, you drive good speed to keep your girl alive.PROS: Pretty Visual Effects Long Joy Ride Attack Helicopter Good Music Easy to DriftCONS: Lack of Obstacles No Controller Support *Have to use Xpadder* Very long and boring drive, which you won't see an obstacle for like a minute or two later each time.Personal OpinionFelt like it has some potential, but it gets very boring after hour.

												Clunky controls, terrible frame rate, and just poor visuals.The game looked great based on the videos and screenshots, but after the opening cutscene everything went downhill. The controls make no sense, WASD for movement, L.Shift for Boost, and Space for brake. Everything is too focused on one hand and makes the buttons feel weird. Arrow keys should be movement but only adjust the camera.There is also little to do, and is essentially an Endless Runner against yourself; there are no leaderboard that I saw, not the the menu is very fleshed out, and there is no other game mode. I'm sure if it was given more time, there would be more to this, but right now, I found it to be not worth my money.			",50,6,0,3,0,0,0

												Game looks great, the idea is cool, and the soundtrack is a sythwave mix that brings joy to my ears, but the controls are VERY uncomfortable and the game itself becomes boring, with only the look and the music keept me going in a 20 minute run. The thing also has a 30fps lock, and on maxsettings it goes lower than that to even 12 fps , making it less enjoyable and eye-tiring. I simply didnt end up liking it, despite my love for retro-everything; and until the dev adds controller support or fixes the framerate, I honestly cant reccomend this experience.

												Controller support is broken and the standard controls are not easy to use and a pain to re-rebind, as both the keybindings and resolution settings needlessly reset every time the game is reopened.  The game has no options actually in the game and needs to be restarted anytime there's a control or graphics issue.			",275,69,6,38,12,0,28

												OutDrive is an arcade racing with  great 80s soundtrack. I dig the aethetics with neon lights on almost everything.  I'll dwell first on what I hate the most, the WTF controls.  The controls are bad really really bad.  And did I mention the controls are bad. With regards to gameplay, it is an endless racing wherein you have to balance your car's speed while preventing your car's engine from overheating or else the girl you are rescuing dies somehow.  I think this is kinda an odd premise, don't you think.  Anyway, the constant balancing act of maintaining a certain speed and not overheating your engine is too hard and quite annoying to tell you frankly.  There is not a lot going on in the highway by way of vehicular traffic other than the occassional ramps every now and then. To sum up, you are buying a racing game basically.  It's only saving grace is its audio and visual presentation. I got it from grabthegames.com for free.  Go ahead and try it while it's free and if it is not avoid it entirely.			",73,19,3,10,6,2,5

												It's hard to write a traditional review about this game. So I'll instead just write my experiences and thoughts while playing.DAY 1Start off playing, barely reading the instructions. I lose 13 seconds in.Second playthrough, die again.And the third one just gets me to 54 seconds with me losing due to a car blockade glitching out.Well, this day ended awfully.DAY 2Reluctantly I load up OutDrive, ready to hate it. I start playing it and was aiming for the 8 minute mark, since that's what the developer requested in the game description. The drive fairs well. 90 seconds in and I start thinking that this is a bit too easy. But, I was certain that it was just the difficulty ramping up. But... it never happened. It stayed that damn easy. I even started seeing repeating stretches of road. Taking that into account, it sounds insane, but I started getting into the groove of the game and I enjoyed it.6 or so minutes in and I saw a city. ""♥♥♥♥ yeah! We'll be driving in the city, going to the hospital, right?"". Wrong. I saw some forks in the road. 3, to be precise. I go through the middle one and just drive through the city and keep going. Since there was no consequence to it, I just kept driving, keeping the woman in the back alive. 8 minute mark. Oh boy! There we go. It was an easy drive, but god damn, here it comes. The dev even wanted us to get there, so it must be awesome. And there it comes, from the top of the screen, a UFO looking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! I guess I'll either be attacked by it, or even more likely, I'll be taken by them and we'll help the girl. But... it comes into view and it turns out to be an attack helicopter. Hmm... ok? What does this have to do with the situation? Well, almost immediately the helicopter starts shooting at me. ""Well, gotta avoid that"", I tell myself. I drive into a tunnel, thinking that this is a moment of respite. And... the helicopter shoots through the mountain. 9 minute mark hits and the helicopter disappears. So, now what? Well, I just kept going. 12 minute mark. I get to another city and I take another route. It leads to the base path again. 13 minute mark and I just get bored of it.16 minute mark. Another helicopter flies in and the same boring stuff goes on.17 minute mark. The helicopter disappears and I start making up a story in my mind. The premise is the same, but I started thinking of what would my friends tell me, if I was just keeping them alive with that car and couldn't stop. 19 minutes in and I start thinking of sacrificing the ♥♥♥♥♥ at 20 minutes and just quit to write this review. During this minute, I figured that I'd use this style to write the review and decided that suicide is the only option here. The game wouldn't be hard enough to legitimately kill me...20 minute mark. I start braking. But at the last second I think: ""Could I drive the opposite way?"" I do that and I can. WHAT? So I could just keep going on one line of road with just turning around and so on to rack up my score. So, this is my experience. Did I enjoy it in the end? No. It was dull.Overall: 3/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move upwards/downwards based on the pros and cons present in the game)			",541,172,24,62,99,8,72

												Before I purchased the game I seen all of these negative reviews and wondered why. The Gameplay looks pretty good, the music is amazing, and the graphics are pretty nice to look at. When I purchased the game and played it for a little... I soon found out why. Now don't get me wrong, the game is pretty cool and fun to play, however there are absolutely no options for the game. no raising or lowering the sound, no changing controls, not even any other game mode options. All you do is pretty much drive. Your goal is to get a high score which I feel shouldn't be it main focus, especially if you're trying to keep a girl alive! Speaking about her, I feel like she's not even there, sure the meter tells us how she’s doing but other than that we get no dialogue from her or the driver, we don't even get to see what they look like in game. Now I've seen some people encounter a lot of glitches, however I didn't have this problem to an extreme. My game glitched out only once and it was for crashing into an oncoming car. I also feel a like there is a lack of action, only a little bit though. There are cars that come after you and a Helicopter that guns you down, but those are in very small sections, after you pass the sections they're gone. Then it's a dead, lonely, empty road. At least have a few cop cars chase for a bit in those sections, really make it like I'm the game, that there is a purpose, to make me feel hype.  I feel like this game should have some kind of story behind it, I mean how you like a movie where the person just drives to keep this girl alive, no ending. At least stay focused on the story and makes the high score part a secondary game mode. Do I recommend the game? No, not unless there do some serious updating, if you're interested buy it on sale.

												OutDrive is a racing game, but not a usually one, because you are racing for someone's life. The action takes place in a neon-colored environment which reminds of the 80's. The road contains different obstacles that you must avoid in order to continue the race. The player is not bored through this process because of the surroundings changes. There are different colorful landscapes, combined with the main theme's neon colors, which makes the play more enjoyable. Another plus is the music, which keeps the player energized and wanting to play further.This game is recommended for racing-game lovers or people who like the 80's and want to feel likewise.

												For a quick fun game, this has potential. If a lot of changes are made I will change my recommendation to positive.  As it stands, being forced to use a keyboard controls in a 3d driver leaves a lot to be desired.  Also the track has an invisible ceiling that can be hit randomly when jumping off ramps, with the potential to flip the car into the wrong direction.  There are also times where the car flips up for no reason.   I was able to make it to 1 hour 57 minutes 41 seconds before being flipped sideway into one of the road blocks.  Not sure if that is a world record (see at twitch.tv/lucid1).   I hope to see improvements made this game, the potential is really there!			",94,13,3,11,7,0,11

												The OutDrive is a ""racing"" game what confirmed retro style and remind for you at 80s. Also this game a bit looks like Power Drive 2000. Well this game is simple enough as well a story to. The girl died, so the only way to keep her alive is contact to car, but its not enough, car should be drived! Your goal this game drive, drive as long as you can, because the only way to keep girl alive is this. But its not so simple how it sounds. You should always keep your mind at speed, because its should be an optimal, not to slow and not to fast either. Beside this after a little time you will find some barricades, bad guys etc, who will try to stop you.The graphics style looks nice, its confirmed in retro 80s neon style, music also fit well to this and sounds good. So my verdict +some nice ideas in a gameplay+nice colorful retro style graphic+nice electronic music+steam cards -no steam achievements-just one game mode So this game is simple enough , at the moment i think game cant keep your mind for very long time. In other fact this have some interesting gameplay elements and game style. So if you like games confirmed in the same style and this kind of endless runner games, you should try this out. The price for this game is enough fair and if get on sales this game can be a good addition to your collection, especially if you like to collect games.			",2101,795,71,247,237,24,306

Teal DeerDevelopers: DenverPublishers: ASK Games Initial release: Feb 2016Genre: Driving, Casual#Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationFULL DISCLOSUREI paid nothing for this. It was a giveaway thing. As such the following will be written from that perspective.Outdrive is a game that is almost not a game. It has some loose narrative in that your girlfriend gets shot and you must 'out drive' the the 'bad dudes' in order to save her and presumably get her to a hospital, if such a thing even exists in the retro neon dystopia of the far flung future. The juxtaposition here is that there is no hospital. For what seems a procedurally generated track, the actual game is really just an endurance run with a timer. You must use boost to keep the car at speed designated by the blue bar directly behind the car. Go to fast or go to slow. She dies. Now, the music in this game is actually quite decent. Its mindless and very relaxing. The tempo decreases and gets distorted when your car is not going at speed. Which is a bit disappointing for relaxing aspect of it but its no matter really. I had a hell of time trying to get a gamepad to actually do anything worth while. Trying two 3rd party programs as well as just setting the key bindings in the setup utility. I eventually settled on just WASD'ing my way through it. I'm no stickler for peoples preferred control method but certain genres beg a specific control scheme. Either way WASD works well enough for this task.The car physics are extremely suspect as well. A gentle tap on the wall will send you spinning and usually end up facing the other way. It seems once the car leaves the ground it weighs less than a piece of paper. At one point I started driving sideways on the invisible boundary of the track and a helicopter knocked me off and I was able to drive out of bounds a short while until I was blasted into the sky and juggled for a bit until my girlfriend died. 


I'm pretty sure I broke it 
A Screenshot of OutDrive

All in all, for free I can't complain. The music is good and WASD isn't totally the worst thing ever for an arcade driver. However, I would never recommend this should you have to pay for it.Follow my curation for more ",1041,295,48,106,93,7,96

On the road you need to get past some roadblocks. The helicopter in the trailer??? I haven't seen it once. That's about it.pros: The scenery is nice.The soundtrack is cool.Cons:BoringBad controls.Where is the helicopter?See my gameplay vid

An excellent proof of concept in an incomplete gameProcedurally generated 80's neon highway with repeating setpieces and turns. The dodgy controls really hold the game back. It's like the one mission in f-zero gx where black shadow plants a bomb on your machine that detonates if you go to slow, so don't hit the walls. The bomb also explodes if you go too fast, so you can't mindlessly mash boost on the game's frequent straightaways. I paid less than a dollar so the price is right, but this game probably isn't worth your time.			",355,69,3,28,16,2,26

												Outrun and its sequels are arcade classics. This is a series that's all about driving all over the world in an expensive sports car. It's just you, the road, and the love of your life. Even when you're not behind the wheel of a Ferrari, your car has the top down, so both the driver and the passenger are visible. This is a minor detail, but it really adds to the sense of escapism. In Outrun 2, the girlfriend is very expressive, cheering on your successful driving skills, and getting annoyed when you bump into cars. While it's easy to say that the Outrun games are great, due to their fantastic controls and solid game-design, it's the tone and atmosphere that really bring it all together.Outdrive is...well I'm going to be serious here. Outdrive is a twisted metaphor for keeping a loved-one on life-support. In the intro, your girlfriend is shot during a hired hit, a drug deal gone bad, or actually... nevermind. The reason is irrelevant. Basically, she's going to die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Even knowing this, you hook her up to your car's engine to keep her alive. This isn't a temporary measure; you aren't going to get her to the hospital or anything. The purpose of this game is to drive for as long as possible, until you either go too slow, too fast, or realize the futility of it all and pull the plug.I hate to go on a moral tangent in a videogame review, but I'm just calling it like I see it. After hooking your girlfriend up to your car, the only signs of life she exhibits are open eyes and in-between songs you can hear some breathing. Granted, she was mortally wounded only minutes ago, but she's already in what could be considered a vegetative state. It would be different if she spoke, or showed some awareness. Maybe she would talk about what happened, use her last moments to reflect upon better times, etc. It's not like her condition will improve, so why do this? So the two of you can sit in silence and listen to synth-music while looking at the neon li-everything?Oh right, the game portion, I nearly forgot to talk about this. In short, the controls are awful. As the other reviews have stated, keyboard-only is the way to go, because you have to constantly boost to keep the girl alive. For whatever reason, the gamepad doesn't function properly. Steering is problematic, and drifting sends you into just as many walls as not-drifting. Oddly enough, your speed doesn't actually matter. As long as you have your finger on the boost, and are making at least some forward (and sometimes even backward!) progress, then the girl will stay ""alive"". It's entirely possible to drive at 10-15 mph and it wouldn't affect anything. After about eight and a half minutes, a helicopter appears to shoot at you. This can cause debris to block your path, but it's mostly ineffective. Although, I will point out that the first time the girl died was because I got stuck in debris, the car flipped upside-down, and everything started spazzing out.By the way, when your girlfriend dies, the game says that you killed her. What? Maybe it's the driver finally accepting the inevitable, and realizing he was wrong to put someone he cares about in such a dangerous situation in the first place. You can also hit the ""r"" key at any time. This is considered the kill button. Now I'm not even sure what the game's intentions are supposed to be. Pressing the ""r"" key causes the game to instantly restart, and you don't recieve a ""You killed her"" message for that. This is what I get for reading too far into things, because now the game is just throwing me for a loop. By the way, if you're driving too fast or slow, your girlfriend will suffer from intense pain. Yes, the game posts a message saying as much whenever you restart.Outdrive isn't just a bad driving game, it's also really depressing. What's the point of playing this game for a long period of time? To brag to others that you kept a dying person alive - possibly against their will - for an hour or two? This is nothing more than a hollow and extremely selfish accomplishment. Just let her go. It's difficult to accept, but it's better this way. I don't mean to delve into these serious subjects, but within minutes of playing, the realization hit me, and I started to feel absolutely horrible. Nobody deserves to be treated like this.So.... yeah... Anyone up for a game of CrotchFighter?			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												GNARLY GAME -- and not in a good way.You can only play OutDrive using keyboard controls, which are overly sensitive, so your car turns 90 degrees into a wall if you're not very, very careful. Maintaining control of the car is difficult given how keys have been mapped -- very cramped. You can re-map the controls, but this kind of game really needs controller support. In this day and age, for this type of game, not including PROPER controller support is just lazy.And for those of you that say that you CAN use a controller ... well, it is not working properly for me. For example, when using the boost, which you absolutely need for this game, I can see it's working, but the game doesn't seem to recognize it, so I die anyway.To survive, you must keep your speed within a certain band -- you can't drive too slow or too fast for extended periods or game over. I can understand a mechanism that encourages the player not to go too slow, but too fast is a problem ...? Totally lame mechanism.Final verdict: 1/10 - Not rad. The 1 point is for style and graphics, but lack of substance.I was hoping for an OutRun-like game ... simplistic but enjoyable driving, but OutDrive is not fun at all. Don't be swayed by the cool graphics, which are definitely amazing. But the game itself is boring and frustrating, with terrible controls. Classic case of a game that have some interesting ideas and looks gorgeous, but fails in execution and gameplay. OutDrive does not deserve your money when so many better games are out there.

												Good:Music is good.Bad:Art is beautiful, but it is extremely similar to Power Drive 2000.Keyboard controls force your hands to be annoyingly posed. Key mapping would be a must.Motivation for racing is interesting but burns off after a while.There are no stages (I made three laps), you can't take a break, you start from the beggining each time, only one game mode and it seems that it has no end. Not really a game (developers say so too).This is really a demo. I am not really sure this should be on sale. At least I got it for free.15 minutes for the girl and sticky keys popped out. Shift.

												OutDrive is a relaxing game that is great to play in the background while you talk to friends. The retro landscape and music is nice, and it's easy to be lulled into a calm space.That being said, this game is very repetitive. Once you've played for 7 minutes, you've played the entire game. The track you drive on is one big loop, and nothing every changes. If you crash, it is very easy to start going again before you fail (where you clearly should), so there is virtually no challenge to this game. This game offers very rudimentary car physics, and it's easy to spin out from tapping the edge of the map or going from 0 to 60 in a way that just feels off. This game offers poor controller support, although, with the steam controller, it can be configured. Other than that, there is no way to edit the controls.At $2.99, this game is not worth it. I got it in a sale for $0.30 and I'm happy with that. If it goes on sale, I'd recommend it. At $2.99, buying it will leave you full of regret.			",128,38,3,8,27,1,10

												This game is absolutely aweful even though the price tag offers little risk to an unsuspecting buyer. Steer clear of it, its a broken mess as far as controls and a few other gameplay elements that are just completely jank.With some configurations coming into the game completely fresh you'd find the camera to be completely crooked with no way of fixing it until you plug in a controller and remap the camera controls to it. However the only redeeming quality of this game is its soundtrack. If you want to listen to some sweet jams look up the artists and support them directly.			",383,18,7,37,5,2,6

												As a game? Outdrive is essentially an endless runner, only you're not running, you're driving a car.This game is all about the aesthetic. It combines SEGA's Outrun with neon lights, a synth pop/early trance soundtrack, for a very unique experience. It's just one of those games you can easily spend an hour non stop playing; if you fail by going to slow or crashing too much a single keypress gets you back in the game.What you see really is what you get. If you like the look of the game and/or have fond memories of Outrun, this is the game for you.			",2533,1063,103,328,347,26,430

												While the music and aesthetics in general are very nice in the game, the controls (or rather lack of them) ruin the game for me. Only keyboard is supported and keys can't be remapped, so I'm left with less than ideal control setup. Even more frustrating, controls are rather fiddly, resulting car darting from side to side and crashing.			",414,187,12,58,50,3,80

												Great looking graphics, good soundings ""new retro wave"" ish music, 80s electro.BUTkeyboard only controls, for a driving game .... it's killing it. But somehow when you get the control everything will be fine.Maybe too fine... Once you mastered the controls, the game become extremely easy. Road is empty, you'll have to face an helicopter shooting at you maybe every 5 minutes.And about the track, 50% of the time you just driving on an empty road, with no traffic and empty surroundings. It gets boring pretty quickly, and I'm pretty sure the map is not generated. During my 20 playtime, I came across the same city, with the same crossroads at least 10 times.About the gameplay, the game expect you to drive not too slow to keep your ""girlfriend"" alive but also NOT TOO FAST.... DO NOT GO TOO FAST ! in a driving game ?!?! Excuse me ? So you've got to juggle with your tubo, toggling it off and on every 10 seconds. Which make the camera pan, zoom in, zoom out, every time... It gets really nauseous.Is this game a sequel to outrun ?Not at all, the crossroad are there but feel empty. I don't feel like accomplishing something when I survive past a crossroad. The background does not change, there is not a map at the end of the run showing off my progress, just a plain timer. Everyhing I'm doing feels empty, and serve no purpose. So in conclusion, in its current game, OutDrive could be the core of a good driving game. But it really needs more polish on the controls, the gameplay, the backgrounds, and need more gamemode.I really wish the dev will update this game, so I can change my review to a positive one.PS : Also beware the game being made on Unity Personal Edition, it is not really well optimized. I barely hit 30 FPS (specs :Intel Core i7-4700MQ + GeForce GT 740M + 12 GB DDR3)PPS : After some research, it looks like dev are just trying to cash in and do a clone of PowerDrive 2000 .... Gonna do some more research but will probably ask for a refund if it turns out to be true.PPS : Quote from developers""It is not a game.Only music concept.Mimimum mechanics - maximum music""So yeah, probably won't be fixed/updated. Refund on its way			",448,140,12,32,35,4,57

There is no challange at all just boring road with nothing on it. Whole game is boring and tedious. Just music and colors keep you from smashing your head on desk.Tip: If you wan't to try it (for some reason) Shift is for boost if you don't use it girl dies.Pros: nice shiny graphics musicCons: gameplay controlsVerdict: another unity crap.

												The game, or concept (as the devs call it) is okay. I've thought a lot about whether I want to give a thumb up or down and I'm not happy with either option. I got it for 1,79€ which might be okay if you really like it. But I have to admit that I'm quite disappointed.As it stands the game doesn't deliver a reason to be played. As other reviews already said - it totally lacks in content und optimization. And I thought about what I feel it's missing:Firstly, it definitely needs more settings. An adjustable camera - it's really hard to see what's coming on the road. Even if it would be like in Trackmania with 3 different positions to choose from. Audio sliders for not only the music, but also the car noises and SFX would be awesome. The game definitely needs graphic options. I just played for 20 minutes but now I've got a huge headache from those horizontal lines and all the different lights everywhere. Please give us an options menu with ways to enable and disable all the different visual effects used. This is literally the first game I've played that game me a headache just because of the visuals.And a menu with a tracklist where you can listen/preview the tracks and disable/enable them for the game. Maybe even add support for own music or spotify/soundcloud. maybe give us an adjustable RNG - like how many events (roadblocks etc.) occur and such.It's just ""Hey, you can drive as long as you want - or can. Look at the street (or the blue bar beneath the car) and enjoy the music (if it suits your taste).""Reasons for playing could include achievements, multiple play modes, maybe even a small storymode. driving through different parts of the country with levels getting harder. and a happy ending where you are actually able to save the girl. just quick ideas for another play mode: relaxation mode, where the girl can't die and you just drive and boost the way you want.The game could also get Steam Workshop support. Player-made mods would be awesome. More car models, different scenery textures, other modifiers. This game has so much potential that just screams to be used!Please make it happen!P.s.: Nothing happened to me after 8 minutes. Not even after 16. Scamaz.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aparently there is a game with this music album. Seriously this is the cheapest music album you can find. Just leave the game running in the background and enjoy.OutDrive itself is shallow. It has some potential for being a decent arcade style game if they ever decide to update it, 'Race the Sun' for example takes this same 'battery powered car' concept and adds endless randomly generated obstacles giving you a real sense of acomplishment for getting a high score. Getting a high score in OutDrive is the equivilent of one of those radio contests to see how long you can keep your hand on a car... but by yourself. The game is just not challenging enough to keep you engaged for very long.Also, gamepad support needs help.OutDrive is a very stylish soundtrack out of 10.			",316,29,7,21,17,2,20

												EDIT: The most recent update added controller support (more or less), fixed key rebinding and maybe a few UI issues, but the controls and physics would've to be improved for me to turn this into a thumbs up.--A simple concept, with good ideas and great music..would be a step in the right direction for this sort of 'game' if the game was properly developed.The controls are clunky, the game is poorly coded, the physics are pretty silly.It could've done with another week of dev time alongside proper feedback.I DO want to see more 'games' and experiences like this, but it feels unacceptable to release something with such a neat idea in such a crude form. As a final heads' up. the game's probably worth 1$ or 2$, and you probably should invest that elsewhere - unless you're really into the 80's and Synthwave like me.			",149,23,1,25,35,1,25

												As a retro wave listener, I really loved the visuals and soundtracks of this game. It's simple: just drive to save your girlfriend. You're not in a race or something like that. You're just driving and avoiding dangers along the way. It would've been much better if it had a goal, ending or achievements. Your car doesn't take any damage so only way to lose is stopping or overheating the car. It's fun, just buy it and enjoy!			",565,97,17,41,29,3,31

												I remember when I was a kid playing games like Pole Position and some other great arcade and Nintendo racing games, some of which I can't remember the names of anymore. During the SNES years, it was Top Gear. Anyway, I remember my dad commenting a time or two about how it bothered him that in these racing games, you have this background that you're heading to, but never seem to actuly get to. The background never tessellates. I remember, at like 10 years old, explaining to my dad that the point of the game was the race, not to actuly ""get anywhere,"" and the background was just an esthetic choice by the artists that had nothing to do with the game's core mechanics. My pops agreed with this, but said it would be cool if you could get to the mysterious city looming in the far background. This struck me as strangely magical thinking for a guy who rarely played video games, who usually spent his days with invoices, groceries, dishwasher repairs, and other boring adult stuff I still don't care about, and probably that is why the idea of ""getting to the background"" stuck in my head for many years. And I'm not the only one, apparently. Games like Grand Theft Auto 5 represent the full experience of the long drive that actuly gets you to the background. Magic. I thought about that a lot after activating Trevor in GTA5, and the game makes you take that LONG drive from the background into the part of the game you were just in on Franklin. Epic. Thought provoking. But one of those thoughts is, In this rush to make these hyper-advanced sandbox games that let us do all these things we dreamed of doing in less-interactive games for years, have we ignored the simpler, more pure and patient pleasures offered us by older games, have we neglected updating that simple experience in favor of games that really just have TOO much going on in them sometimes? Enter the new generation of ""retro"" games, with new graphics and sound, but with more pure game-play elements than the standard ""do whatever you want and get a trophy for everything"" style that the console industry churns out by the billions these days. Out Drive is one of those games. There is no where to ""get to,"" once you're there you just win. But the GAME itself is driving, just DRIVING. Driving with a sense of urgency, not to get anywhere in the game, but to GET somewhere inside yourself. Plumb the depths of your skills. There is no real plot, you just HAVE. TO. DRIVE. You're already where you're getting to. Just. Drive.			",168,37,5,22,15,0,15

												EDIT: After looking into some of the threads on the community hub for this game its quite clear that this is a complete rip-off of Powerdrive 2000. Don't buy this and wait for Powerdrive 2000 to be released.I would recommend to anyone who has bought it to request a refund.- - - - OLD: This game looks really good, has a cool soundtrack but overall is pretty average and boring.Although I’d say it is probably worth the £1.20 I paid for it. It still needs some polish though, so I recommend waiting before you buy it.			",683,231,29,122,94,19,117

Getting real about OutDrive...A lot of what I've been able to complain about can be found in a video I made regarding the game.


YouTube™ Video: OutDrive REVIEW: Not A Game, Aesthetic Concept 

			Views: 177		

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/441870/ OutDrive is a cyberpunk-inspired car driving ""experiment"" that should've been canned ultimately.		

As for the game itself, my genuine review is a series of pros and cons.ProsCurrently cheap at $1.79Has decent enough synthwaveLow spec requirementsConsGraphics are dullCrummy vehicle handlingPoor controller supportRebinds borkedClaims to be more than it isThis is not a special game designed as an ""aesthetic concept."" It's a game, and a poor game at that. If you didn't want a game, don't bother making anything that looks or plays like a game.As for the ""asset theft,"" I've looked at the gameplay and resources between the two, and besides the aesthetic that are clearly shared, nothing about OutDrive comes from Power Drive 2000. The assets ARE original... they're not impressive assets, but they ARE original.No assets have been stolen. It's just a boring and janky game. Stop spreading misinformation.Idiots.

												Honestly, this game was pretty disappointing.PROS--- The music is great!- Graphics and scenery are stunning for a Unity game!CONS--- Controls are weird. I guess it's because I'm not used to playing car games with WASD keys mapped to move the car.- Boring gameplay. Seriously, you just drive a DeLorean at a stable speed the whole time, with some twists, turns, and roadblocks at times.- A tutorial was never added in the game, so you don't know how to play. This would force you to either A: smash every button until you do something right, or B: go online and look it up. This could've been avoided easily.- Rather awkward ""game over"" screen. If you fail the game, it instantly ends showing a picture of a man carrying her dead girlfriend (which is also the cover art of this game) with the subtitles reading ""GIRL DEAD"".- Game overall just looks unfinished. It's not even Early Access anymore.			",29,4,22,1,11,1,0

Controls while simple WASD controls feel ackward and make controling the vehicle difficult. Coudn't get mapped keys on my Steam controller to work either.

												Cool music, cool athletic and atmosphere, but unfortunately no point to it all. It's an endless runner with no upgrades, achievements or leaderboard to give you a reason to play. I stopped after driving for 15 minutes and I won't go back to beat that because there is no reason to. I love this game, but there is no reward or objective to make this worth playing.

												This game is $2. They say you get what you pay for, and that's exactly what you get with this ""game"". Is it a game? Essentially, you drive down a very beatifully made road reminiscent of 80's movie posters and typefont listening to music of the Overdrive genre. The music is really good, the visuals are awesome. But I don't recommend the game because it's not really a game. It is better off being a youtube video, showing these visuals with the music. You don't do anything. You accelerate your car while maneuvering on a track. If you hit the walls it slows you down, and you have to stay at a certain speed to keep your girlfriend alive. I realize this sounds like a game, but when you get the hang of it, you realize that it's not only simple to master, but there's nothing else. Just an endless road of curves that you have to press A and D to go through. I can't give it too much flak since it's only $2, but it's just not worth it.			",94,4,1,10,4,0,9

												This game is horrible, I love it. Its painful to play, silly, makes little sense, I think the russians made this game to confuse us. basically you play as a guy trying to stop a girl from over heating in a car. Its really terrible. The music is worth it. 1 99 aint bad at all. its trippy AF nd basically play it blazed is probably the best option. I just wish dis bizz would get out of my car so i can enjoy the anththetics or however you spell it. See? It confuzzles me. What a waste.

												Although the game feels a little repetitive it's well worth the pocket change it costs. It's not very challenging but it's fun to drive around and experience the visuals and the environment with the soundtrack.Some people have commented on the repetition of the game, and I'd have to mostly agree. There are three paths to choose from. Each path seems to have a couple of stages to it and you do a couple laps on each stage before completing that path. So it's a little repetitive but not really.			",136,6,17,6,18,2,6

Can you get her to the Hospital in Time so you can save her & see to it that she sees the light of day or Die Trying?

												Welp, another useless thing sitting in my steam library gathering pixel dust.Storyline: Your girl gets injured and you link her heartbeat (I assume), to your car and drive far away from the people who hurt her. You must keep a constant speed that isn't too fast and also not to slow because she will die.Gameplay: So, for the first couple of minutes it's pretty and feels decent, despite rather sluggish and delayed for a driving game. I can't help but link this to a poorly made time wasting browser game for the lack of depth. Graphics: Really nicely rendered retro feel. Environments are pretty, but get repeated too much to continue being interesting after a short time.Soundtrack: Outdrive seems to have a running theme of being good for a few minutes and then get boring and quite frankly irritating due to lack of depth, change and replay value. In this case, replay value is bad because it's the same track looped.Menu: Play and exit. That's it. Basic, bland, lacking any kind of character and aids in making it feel like a time wasting web browser game. Final Overview: Retro does NOT equal good, quit trying to ride on things that look retro and cool to suck people in and then put no effort into making the final product interesting. This has absolutely no replay ability in the slightest. I could see myself really forcing myself to make it interesting by challenging a friend and trying to beat their time, but it would still sap my drive to play it because there is nothing to it.Good to waste a little bit of time, and then let it sit in your steam library along with the rest of relics you said you'd play some day but sit under a pile of dust. (Admit it, we all have a few in that dusty pile).I always get sucked in. It was pretty, but alas, that's the only thing it has going for it.			",385,128,19,39,53,4,53

												This ""game"" was basically done by a Russian guy to advertise Russian synthwave/retrowave artists. Gameplay wise, 8 minutes is just enough to see everything this has to offer. Your biggest obstacles are not the ""enemies"" but the controls and the bugs that will send you flying off the map.The music is amazing though. Check out the dev's announcements to go to their pages and give them a listen instead of playing this rubbish.Full review:

												I want to like this game but the controls are so wonky. I wanted to change them to arrow keys but apparently that's the camera keys and those cannot be changed. Why would you even need camera keys for a game you do nothing but drive FORWARD in? I did manage to move the key binding to a more suitable setting but the settings reset every time you load the game so it's a hassle to re-input the keys and resolution dimensions every time you load up. Also the load up itself is clunky where you have to click around, at least 3 times for the game to completely load/start up and you have to to use your mouse to click start game as it does not detect any keys at the start menu. Oh and there's no real lifebar for the girl, she just dies outta no where (for me it's typically around 1:30 minutes of gameplay)The upside is the visuals and music are pretty magnificent but the game is a hassle to load up/play in general.

A background for your musicKeep the girl alive by boosting, avoiding the cops and drifting on tight curves.There's no actual way of saving the girl, so you will be playing until whenever you feel like.Its an endless runner in the sense that it never ends, you would have to lose on purposeTheres no difficulty whatsoever, theres no rewards or objectives, it just goes on and on...what could have been a decent game with good music, unnecessarily turned into a mediocre experience, that no one could ever play for more than 15min.Outdrive does a better job at promoting artists than it does creating actual content.Pros: Visually appealing Good Music Interesting conceptCons: No controller support Predefined keys Impossible to maintain the car in a straight line No way of losing No way of winning No achievements ",1274,458,45,110,117,11,152

												I'll start this review by saying that OutDrive is at best a glorified flash game.If this ''product'' would have been released in the 1980's,it would have been a decent experience but it was released on Steam in 2016.ControlsDefault controls for keyboard are WASD for directions,SHIFT for speed boost and SPACE for drifting.GameplayIf you jump into the game without reading something about it beforehand,you might be confused.The game fails to explain exactly what the objective is.Apparently you need to save the girl by driving fast.If you are driving too slow,her heart will stop.If you are driving too fast,it will hurt her.Sounds simple enough..and it is.After 5 minutes you will be bored to death.The music isn't particularly good for you to keep playing..and you can simply listen to it online and do something else in the meantime.Only one map that never ends and after awhile,seems to repeat itself.No obstacles,weird car physics and an attack helicopter that spawns and shoots you even if you are in a tunnel but misses every single shot all the time.GraphicsThe retro style graphics look decent and the world around the car is certainly more interesting than the gameplay.MusicIt's nothing special and every track sounds familiar because it's the stereotypical retro music that you already know too well.And if you don't,you can find better retro music elsewhere and you can certainly find better things to do while listening to it.OutDriveI can't recommend this game for a few reasons.First of all,it has a pricetag.There are literally thousands of free games out there that are better than this.Second of all,there are literally thousands of similar/better retro music tracks out there that don't require you to play a boring car game.''Not a game,aesthetic concept'' This quote is taken from the description of the game.But it has a pricetag.If it's a aestethic concept,make it free.Don't bother with this.

												Very boring and dull. Scenary is monotonous and constant input is required so you can't just enjoy the soundtrack and atmosphere. I bought the game because I love synthpop, retro futuristic settings and it was cheap. The music is good, but I'd rather spend the money directly on the artists than this.

												I was wondering why a game this good-looking was so cheap, but I figured I'd try it anyway.The reason is that it's an endless runner(?) with one mode that feels half-done in spite of the simple premise. Xinput controls feel annoyingly incomplete out-of-the-box and the game only gives you about ten seconds to get acquainted with all of the various driving mechanics before you ""die"" and it forces you to restart. You also need to be boosting from the beginning.It's pretty telling that the Game Over screen is just the title image.Worth noting is that there's another retro 80s-style racing game called Power Drive 2000, which is coming out soon, that this game seems to be trying to rip off and make a quick buck. And Power Drive 2000 has different game modes, cars, and tracks. I'll be buying that one, instead.TL;DR Save your money and buy Power Drive 2000			",390,66,6,28,8,2,36

Gameplay is almost nonexistent, unresponsive, unrewarding, repetitive (not in addictive or fun way). Controls are garbage. Physics are trash. Despite looking like a polished Xbox360 era game, the hit detection is like an N64 release title.THERE ARE PLENTY OF FREE GAMES MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND JUST BUY THE SOUNDTRACK.My wife got me this as a gift so I can't get a refund even though it took 3 minutes to realize I want to get her money back. I think she got excited for the music and theming and didn't notice the majority of the reviews were bad.Not bad for a college project game, but NOT a well-finished title for Steam release.Again,Final Score: 3/10			",185,26,6,15,16,3,29

												Love the idea of this with the endless world to drive in with the environment and music to match a theme.The problem with this game is in the controls and the handling of the car. The controller support is very sketchy and the Keyboard and mouse feels more like gliding on a sled then driving a car not to add in I am not sure if there is any reverse feature in case you run into a wall or a pile of cars. The game does have some stuttering problems also even on a over recommendation computer.The idea that this is a project made for the music is kind of a joke also because the music is constantly interupted by having to turn the boost on and off to keep the heart rate gauge in the correct range. If you like the music I would suggest just buying it rather then the game.			",337,103,4,37,27,3,31

												You will get back in 80's in your Delorean by cruising down the road and listening this addictive retro music. Everything in this endless runner game is about 80's and you will like it. I mean who doesn't like a Delorean. It will remind you about that cool movie back in 85' ""Back to the Future"", ah the memories..

												The best way I could describe this game is ""boring.""It's essentially an endless runner game, but with a car. Sounds fun, right?There are no significant obstacles or threats meaning you'll essentially keep going until you get turned around with the controls and can't recover. Makes the replay value pretty low.It's a shame, because I love the idea. The graphics and sound are gorgeous and the atmosphere is great. There's just nothing to keep me playing, no new content no progression. All you do is drive with no goal.Very disappointing.			",267,129,4,71,40,5,43

OutdriveIts a game where you drive a car and if you hit a wall, get shoot alot, drive too slow or drive to fast the girl will die. So in the 17min i played this i drove a car and it was too easy, at the start there were som cars that tried to ram you and later some helicopters will viset you and in the 17min there was two helicopters and seven cars that tried to slow me down. It was really boring but i was afk some time and got the cards and i will try this game if it becomes harder but if not i will never play it again. Good thingsGood Soundtrack.It looks beautiful.Bad thingsThere was no fun in the 17 min i played this game.Not Difficult it was so easy that even if you hit a wall you can get a comeback pretty easy.Feels like they just want us to buy there album.Extra infoI rate this 2/10Will update my review if they update there game.tl;dr It is boring and i think it will only be fun if you are stoned.

												I can understand why this game is getting a beating, but there are some positives...The dev clearly states that its not a game, but an experimental musical project, so you can accept some of the bad game design area.The collision is very unforgiving, and it would absolutley benefit from controller support, and the game is very frustrating at times.The positives for me where the game mechanics of needing to keep your speed up, but also not to over heat, due to the car being linked to the girl. The slow down of the music and visual dull down as you actually slow down is a nice effect. Fair play to these guys, but I think this game needs a bit more work to scrape back some positive reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all: This is not a real game!It's merely made to be an aesthetic experience and should be handled as one.For what it has been made, it's really great.The gameplay is soothing and makes as much fun as you want it to be.If you're into this retro style and don't care about gameplay, you'll like it.However, the keybindings are horrible. Changing them is confusing(two boosts, breaks and accelerations that do different things?) and don't work on the trigger.Additionally, the settings won't be saved. At all.When you close the program, you have to redo every key setting you've changed the next time.Overall it's a nice concept that is worth the money, especially in sale.But if you want to play it on a controller, you'll be disappointed.

												In this musical racing runner you have to keep up moderate speed on a randomly generated endless track for your wounded girlfriend's life support is connected to the car's engine. Yep, it's 80's style sci-fi. There's a translucent gauge at the rear bumper which should indicate middle range - higher speeds overheat the system, and lower speed.. slows down current music tempo, makes the screen go greyscale & also the girl dies of heart insufficiency rather soon. Car physics is close to NFS1, effects & reflections look nice, minimalistic urban landscape and easy music do their job, no lags despite it's a Unity project. The music slowdown effect when you crash is made really fine, it feels exactly like a vinil plate being rubbed!В этом музыкальном гоночном бегунке вам предстоит держать среднюю скорость на случайно создаваемой бесконечной трассе, так как система жизнеобеспечения вашей раненой подружки подключена к мотору машины. Да, это фантастика 80-х. На заднем бампере полупрозрачная шкала должна показывать средний диапазон - высокая скорость перегревает систему, а низкая... замедляет темп играющей музыки, делает экран черно-белым, а также девушка вскоре умирает от сердечной недостаточности. Физика машины близка к уровню Жажды скорости 1, эффекты и отражения смотрятся неплохо, минималистичный городской пейзаж и легкая музыка делают свое дело, не заметно тормозов, ххотя это и проект на Единстве. Эффект замедления музыки при столкновениях сделан действительно здорово, ощущается точь-в-точь как будто прижимаешь виниловую пластинку!			",1420,573,53,157,158,19,229

												This game really does well in taking 1980's/Vaporwave aesthetics into a 3d world and the gameplay itself is fine however honestly gameplay-wise I couldn't stomach more than half an hour before getting extremely bored at how repetetive it got. Nice job on the developers part for making the game, but more features are needed if you want people to play it a lot instead of people just buying for the aesthetic, getting bored and refunding it.

												As an endless driving game, for the price I paid (60% off, literally less than the price of a Big Mac), in the old-school arcade format with this killer soundtrack and pretty visuals, I could not ask for better. The game is simple, as are the mechanics, but they are very effectively employed. You really just keep driving for the music. So if you're looking for a way to vegetate a little bit while listening to pretty awesome synthwave-type music, this is for you. If you vehementaly demand any sort of complexity or depth of experience in every game you play, however, then I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere.			",169,57,6,24,25,2,45

												if you're into synth tunes and retro 80s / electronica stuff, it's worth the price of admission, if nothing else than to hear some groovy tunes and play a very simple racing game. Unfortunately the game beyond a generic time counter and some drifting / jump-hitting there isn't much purpose, unfortunately there is an overheat meter that limits you from just flooring it constantly (ala Excite Bike, or something of the like...) which tends to both emit a somewhat annoying noise when you accelerate, and also limit how much you can just be barreling along listening to the tunes. All that aside, for the price and considering it's a bit of a what you see is what you get kind of game, what is presented is well-made.			",355,104,3,23,6,0,20

												Sadly its all style and no substance. It feels weird reviewing a game after such little playtime but there just isn't much to OutDrive at all. The art direction and soundtrack are extraordinary. The aesthetic they were trying for is just superb and they delivered that. But not much of anything else. The options and settings are nearly non-existent. The controls are absolutely entirely unclear. You have your typical acceleration, but that does next to nothing. You really need to use the endless boost ability to go anywhere and maintain your run. There's a gimmick of maintaining your boost above, but also below, a certain point. You fail that either direction and your drive is over. Other than that, its just an endless road. Wide and slow winding with very little obstacles. A mere three areas or so to drive through too. They repeat. Quickly. The boost gimmick does little to break the tedium.  A drift ability is there but entirely unneeded for any corner in the game. But it does give you something to play with during the monotony. At the eight minute mark I saw a helicopter. It shot at me but did nothing, a few turns later it blew up for no reason. So there was that.By all accounts I can find, the game really is endless. There's no motivation, goals, or leaderboards. And with little to no challenge its just a matter of how long you feel like listening to more of the soundtrack and making your eyes bleed neon. I really wish there was more here to make use of the style, but there just is not. Skip this one.			",349,99,30,51,32,9,68

												It's like Desert Bus. The only challenge is how long you can pay attention. You just drive around the same track over and over until you don't feel like going anymore. You can lose by going too fast or too slow but it's not challenging at all. It's pretty relaxing and has a great aesthetic but it's really not fun. It's extremely repetitive.

												Amazing music but a missed opportunity.   The controls and mechanics of this game are just horrible. I could really get into just driving if it worked well but it feels like somebody's first attempt at making a game. The music is fantastic and I'd recommend getting the soundtrack, but the gameplay is just not fun. The visuals need work too but they're passable. This would be such a nice game to just drive and relax to if the controls weren't frustrating. It is very hard to get the mechanics right in a racing / driving game, and they missed the mark by a lot. You don't get a very good sense of speed. The car just kinda stops when you hit an obstacle. There is no feedback from the driving so you are really aware you're playing somebody's early attempt at a video game.If they could get the driving mechanics down and make it a smooth, easy to play game, then their goal of an aesthetic experience would have been reached. Instead, you just get great music and a game you don't even want to try to play because it is so frustrating an unnatural. I applaud the effort and wish they had more time and talent behind the game mechanics, but this cannot be recommend as a game. Just get the music.			",1029,253,56,109,82,11,190

												Yes i would recommend this game if it was free like i got it, short version is the love child between outrun and a dj and at least you should try this game once.I played in the keyboard with no problems, so it is not a real reason to be ♥♥♥♥♥y about this gameWhy thumbs up? Because you can see the hard effort of the developers put into this game, but it is missing key elements to call it a game, like they put it "" it is not a game"", well in that we can agree. The only score you see is the endurance of time you can manage to stay between driving fast, avoiding road blocks, cars, avoiding the helicopter every 8 minutes and for the last and not least important your own boredom, yes your own boredom while you are enjoing the music the track starts to feel repetitive, that is because is not a track but a circuit. I manage to keep the girl alive for 30 minutes and see the game wasnt going to be much different so i killed her by driving really really fast.What would make this a better game? - Score between how fast you are driving vs the time you are doing, because right now there is no goal- Scoreboard- More stages- level of difficult between stages, like the need to use more nitro because the car starts lo loose speed faster- Maybe an ending of you saving the girls live ",181,20,22,18,7,2,5

												OutDrive+ Cool art style+ DeLorean+ Some nice songs+ Steam Cards- Only one car (awesome car, but more would be good)- Almost no variety (feels like playing the same track all the time)- Only one game mode- Bad physics- Bad game design- So easy it gets boring quicklyI really wanted to like this game, as I like the 80's, DeLoreans and endless runners, but If you want to drive a DeLorean, there are a lot of better games for you.I got it on a giveaway, and I can only recommend it if you can get it for free too.

												OutDrive is almost a great experience (ALMOST). The aesthetic is of course top tier and the music is great as always new age synth. In this respect it feels like FarCry: Blood Dragon mixed with the movie Drive and that is a stylistic match made in heaven. These music and visuals are both pretty solid qualities of the game but unfortunately what supports these aspects are nowhere near as impressive. You simply drive in OutDrive, it's a procedurally generated driving game in which you just have to keep moving within a certain speed range or else you fail. Sometimes there's some random events that happen but that literally just consists of either brief oncoming traffic or an attack helicopter that tries to shoot you. These are handled pretty well for the most part and I don't mind a game in which you just drive but there is a real lack of content here, even for a game that's £2. There are no online leader boards or particular diversity to each playthrough. Despite technically driving through a unique path each time, it barely feels any different and having only a couple of short random events just leaves me slightly unsatisfied. However there are two major problems with the game that render the rest unimportant. The game performs horrendously, this will likely be one of the most demanding indie games you play. It's surprising how good of a rig you will need in order to run this game at 60FPS, it even struggles to maintain 30FPS on a PC that can run most big releases on mid-low settings. Another problem in terms of optimization is crashes, I've had this game crash 4 times on me completely out of nowhere and I've heard similar complaints from other Steam users. The second major problem would be the controls, the car just doesn't handle well at all. It feels rigid and clunky, I fail to see how such a key aspect of a driving game was made so poorly. While it's possible to overcome the bad car handling to an extent, you'll never feel as though it plays the way it should.I really wanted to like this game and from a visual and audio standpoint I absolutely do. I even think many tracks from the OST will be ones I'll listen to outside of the game. But a lack of diversity, lack of real content, lack of optimization and lack of decent controls stop me from being able to recommend this game. Don't bother with the game at all, even if you see it for free just don't get it.Scores:Audio & music : 8/10Visuals: 8/10Gameplay: 3/10Optimisation & performance: 2/10Value (at full price): 5/10Final verdict: 4/10 AVOID COMPLETELY!!!

												The segmented orange sun hits your eyesas you drive onward, with you glancing atthe phantom image of Summer-Rain byyour side, connected to the car engine tokeep her alive. Like the old Acceleracerscommercials, live to drive, drive to survive.OUTDRIVE.Since using the Lordvessel in the previousgame you completed and avoiding yourevil double's dark fate of plunging realityinto darkness, you find yourself in a retro1980s world, leaving a nightclub with her,Summer-Rain, or an analogue of her in this neon reality.The soundtrack floods overhead as coloraccents the world, immersing you fully asyou remember what it is to relax properly,to love again as she smiles and takes youby the hand into the smoky streets of1985. Suddenly, men from this timelinepull up with guns, mistaking you for theirtarget. They open fire.Now you find yourself in the game, stuckwithin the confines of the world. Simpleand easy to maneuver with a beautifulretro-synth soundtrack permeating everycorner, the rules and gameplay of this world are dead simple - if the car stops,Summer-Rain's heart stops too.So you drive. Onward and forever. There isno true payoff to the game, the world initself, the only gain of this strange, idealworld you wanted was the chance to bewith Summer-Rain again. But every timeyou stall or are hindered, the game bringsup the game over screen, but instead ofyourself, you see none other than thesecond of the Trinity of Hollywood, yourenemy Shadow of Doubt.You reload into the world once again,Summer-Rain breathing hard as you levelout your speed while trying to maintain acruising speed while the world demands more of you to keep Summer-Rain's heart beating consistently. After what feels likean eternity of constant speed, stalling,death and rebirth, Shadow of Doubtappears in the backseat as you respawn.""Starboy Coldheart."" Doubt announces,as you blink a bit to make sure he is reallythere. You maintain speed once again asyou feel the car gaining, and Summer-Rainquietly easing into the seat for the drive.""Shadow of Doubt. Where's Conscience?After I defeated Gwyn in the Kiln of theFirst Flame and reignited the world-""Shadow of Doubt adjusts his glasses before interrupting you with an archedeyebrow and a smirk. ""You're not tired of dying and being reborn constantly, are you?""You wince as you pass a lap completion andthe demand for constant speed gets higher""Answer the question, Doubt."" you hiss theretort through gritted teeth.Shadow of Doubt leans back and checks hisfingers, looking bored. ""Killer's Consciencehas returned to his home reality, from whatI understand he's being punished by ourmaster there."" You glance back at Doubt,who gestures for you to focus on the neonlandscape ahead.""Punished?! Why?"" You ask, surprised byyour own concern at the fate of the leaderof this band of enemies. ""Hollywood foundout about Conscience helping you find a wayoffworld, to these other games. You werenever supposed to have this knowledge, thisability, this gift and this curse.""""Why did he help me then? And why are youhere?!"" You question Shadow of Doubt, whosees this version of Summer-Rain looking outinto the window, quiet and morose. ""Starboy.""Shadow of Doubt begins, looking a lot moreserious now. ""You're not tired of dying andrespawning over and over in game worlds onour Summer-Rain's behalf are you?""You realize with the newfound emotions ondisplay from Shadow of Doubt, that this landof the 1980s is his own reality. ""What's thisgot to do with anything Doubt?!"" You panicslightly as a large helicopter veers across thehorizon into view, here to stop you as the world did not expect you to survive this longand prolong Summer-Rain's life.""Answer the question, Coldheart. We're notafraid or tired of doing this over and over forher, aren't we? Aren't you?"" You nod, lookingat the helicopter and tensing to adapt to itsattack pattern. ""Yes, Doubt. I'm not afraid,never for her."" Doubt looks at the helicopter,to his Summer-Rain and then to you.""Mr. Hollywood promised me if I helped him,Summer-Rain would stop dying here. I wouldnot have to relive this over and over. But youcan stop all this for yourself, Coldheart.""The helicopter unleashes a torrent of bullets,trying to veer you off course and stall theprecious speed keeping Summer-Rain alive.""How, Doubt?! What do I do?!"" Summer-Raincloses her eyes shut as Shadow of Doubt putshis hand on both you and her shoulders.""Trust me Starboy. Let go.""""WHAT?!"" You shout, incredulous.""Seriously, that's all you need to do. The Lordvessel will handle the rest. But as long asyou don't let go, you'll be tethered here, tomy world of constant suffering for the womanof our dreams.""You look back to the helicopter as it readiesa volley of rockets towards the car. You lookback to both Shadow of Doubt and this versionof Summer-Rain, who is already phasing out,about to be reborn again for the next round.""Come on Starboy. We can take all this. But Idoubt she can. Find a way to be happy. Dowhat you must.""You look at the Lordvessel in your pocket asit glows faintly, and the rockets are unleashedupon the car, closing in fast. You feel the warmglow of reality bending, while Shadow of Doubtawaits for the world to respawn him and thelove of your lives. In an instant, you are gone,and Shadow of Doubt closes his eyes.""Let go.""OUTDRIVE. ",30,2,1,6,0,0,3

												OutDrive reminds me of my old casette player back in '95. It was broken so I had to hold the ""Play"" button to listen to the music I was into. On one hand it made me feel uncomfortable, on the other - I had great time listening to my favourite tracks. Same kind of feeling I have with OutDrive - the gameplay is bad, at point I can say this is hardly a game at all. Your DeLorean handling is awful, physics are non-existent and there's no controller support (for the game like this - almost a crime). The other big problem I had is the lack of any motivation to play. There's no rewards - no achievements, no ladder to compare your results with other players, no story (I don't count the intro movie), no new cars or new maps. nothing. If you add the fact OutDrive is too easy - you'll have no problem getting over 20+ minutes in single run. I can't say graphics is good, cause it is not. But the design is good - lots of neon and polygon-like surronding give this 80's feeling. The part game shines - is the music (not the sounds - they are bad). The OST consists of synth/retro-wave tracks and there are LOTS of them (played for 3 hours and heard the same music once or twice). So if you're a fan of the genre (like I am) you'll have good time listening to it.Just like i said - OutDrive reminds me of my old casette player, except it's not broken. It's hard to really accept OutDrive as a game, cause it feels more like WinAmp visualization came to life. Can i recommend it? Yes, if you're into that genre of music. For the price it's awesome deal.If you want good racing game and not a BIG fan of such visuals or music - stay away. You'll get bitter aftertaste.			",417,166,8,58,24,5,49

												(This game was suggested by Zaraki Snakenoman and provided by Freegamesinfo.net .  Thanks, guys!)On first glance, it feels like Rad Racer from NES.  A game from my childhood.  I booted it up and saw that eerie little window that shows up before you open a game asking me for my graphic preferences.  I then am able to access the game.....no....no dear god, NO!!!!! ""Made with Unity personal edition"".Well, the story's simple even though the text goes off screen, and no matter the resolution, the relatively quick scrolling text vanishes on the left and right sides of the screen.  Basically, you end up in a gunfight while on a date with your girlfriend.  During the gunfight, your girlfriend gets fatally wounded.  In order to spend more time in her last moments of life, you hook her up to the car's engine to act as her life support.  After that, the game begins.  The goal of the game is about survival.  Go too slow, the girl dies.  Go too fast, the engine overheats, the girl dies.  The controls feel awkward and the game needs polishing.Although everything I've said so far is negative, there is good news.  The graphics look good and the music sounds sweet.....until you overheat or go too slow, to where it sounds like distorted garbage.This game is on the right track to being something decent in unity, but it needs a lot of polishing before it can be something good.  $3 is not justified here.

												The graphics are nice, great 80s esthetic but they put a surprising amount of strain on a computer. The controls via kb or gamepad are not great.  Maybe too sensitive? The gameplay is simple in theory, and seems forgiving, but you inevitably end up losing anyway. The music is why one would buy this game. It's the dev's custom selection of choice synthwave tunes, and it's really nice while you're surviving and going at a good speed, but while you're dying, it slows the tempo and sounds like crap, and then when you lose, it stops.  Not good.  The game files do not have MP3s and there's not a simple way to extract the songs, and there's no ""soundtrack DLC"" so in the end, this software is pretty useless.

												I don't see why this game is getting such terrible reviews.For the cheap price that it is listed as, I believe you get everything you could want out of it.Sure, the gameplay is a little linear, but not to the point where your head starts to ache and you wish for anything but the eternal purgatory that is linear gameplay. The enemies get increasingly then decreasingly difficult, which is nice because in the eternal drive through the sunset- it feels good to pick up the pace and slow it down at different intervals. The soundtrack and visuals alone are worth the money, it's gorgeous to look at and just... well, just *drive*I don't know, I guess I'm one of those people, I go out on random drives with my SO and we just relax along the road as the sun sets, this feels like that.Not to mention the little back story they add in the beginning, it isn't a whole lot but it nearly brought my eyes to a watering point. The driver's dedication to his girlfriend is heart warming and sad, and it sets the whole premise for your eternal drive. I love this game, and I don't care if I'll ever only play 2 hours of it or less, it's worth the small fee.			",331,90,13,33,21,2,22

												I love this game! I feel like a total bad♥♥♥♥♥just having this game in my library! This game makes me feel nostalgic, I love the neon lights, the tropical trees and how this game sort of gives me an adrenaline fix. I probably enjoy this game more then need for speed! This game is a hidden gem I give it a 10/10 The soundtrack alone is pure gold. The intro is so epic. If you like Retro music and the futuristic 80's vibe you're going to love it. This game reminds me of when I used to live in Cali. I love speeding fast down the freeway listening to retro and techno. I can't express how much I love this game, don't listen to the negative reviews! I'm so glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews I would of missed out, as this game is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played. The art work is superb, you can also get cards and make a badge for it. It's so worth it. I also love how you have to keep up the speed of the car because they shot his girlfriend and he hooked her up to the engine and to keep her alive you need to keep driving, it's just so epic and it's so unique. I think it's worth the buy. It's a great classical game, and I'm completely in love with it. Whoever made the soundtrack deserves a billion dollars. Playing this game just makes you feel like a total bad♥♥♥♥♥ My attitude when I seen this game was shut up and take my money. <3			",21,4,2,9,0,0,0

												If the game would not have been 0,59 € when I bought it I probably would have asked for a refund.It looks amazing, the music is awesome (if you are into Synthwave), but the gameplay is very lacking. You are forced to slow down not to kill the girlfriend. It would have been more fun if this was a straight up Outrun clone or the car would be a getaway car. What am I missing? - substance of gameplay- more variety- some sort of sense of progressionIf you are into the aesthetics its worth picking up at a heavy discount.

												The aesthetics of the game are spot on 80s.  Everything is bright blue and purple neon--even the car model used is the quintessentially 80s DeLorean DMC-12. And the music is perfect period synth-pop, excellently composed.The ""story"" is as follows. You're some kind of wheelman for some shady people and the S goes down. Your girl takes a bullet for your sorry butt and somehow (it's not really explained how this works) you connect your car's engine to your girlfriend's heart, which apparently keeps her heart beating. You drive for as long as possible until you foul up. You foul up, the girl dies and the stage ends.  There is no end stage--you go until you can't go any further, then try again to go farther. There really isn't much to this game.The controls are awkward and not customizable, and there is no gamepad support as of this writing (2/23/16).You boost to go faster (by holding LShift) and you'll need to be boosting most of the time. Being off boost means the meter that follows your car drops. Dropping too low (to the left) means your girl starts to die--her heart slows down, the music distorts and everything goes gray.  Going too far to the right makes the car overheat (which isn't doing your dying girlfriend any favors either). Roadblocks, jumps and attack choppers will all attempt to slow you down on the endless winding road.As I said, the controls are awkward.   WASD to control the car, arrows to control the camera (you will almost never need to use these) LShift to boost and Space to drift.  The WASD controls mean your pinky is left to the boost button, and as I said before you'll be on boost more than you're off. This gets really tiring after a few minutes and it's needlessly awkward.The game is unsubstantial and could use some extremely basic additions (like gamepad support, or even the ability to remap controls).  I can't recommend this game at full price. In fact even for what I paid ($1.79) I'm not sure if it's worth the money.			",71,20,22,24,27,1,1

												Tl:DR: It looks great, sounds great, but is held back by mechanical weakness. Story:Outdrive is a game about driving (unsuprisingly). The story outlines a nameless man who gets in trouble with some other nameless men, leading to the first mans girl getting shot and now the only thing he can do to save her is hook her heart up to the engine and keep on driving so she can keep on living. Essentially, the story is very week and should not really be bothered with.Sound:The music in this game is fantastic, no other way to put it. It really helps bring out the neon 80's aesthetic and doesn't get old too fast. The sound effects are serviceable but are nothing special and the acceleration effect can become irritating after awhile.Graphics:Another thing the game does well is visually present itself. It looks great and the color scheme is perfect for the atmosphere the devs were shooting for. As a side note the launcher itself could have a few more presets. Even though it's a unity game it would be nice to have 8x AA without forcing vsync on as well.Controls:The controls in OutDrive aren't terrible but they don't necessarily feel good. The steering feels rigid and the drifting can be quite fiddly at times, which many times ends up with you smashing into the invisible barriers alongside the road.Gameplay:This is my major gripe with this game. Now, first let me clarify that I understand that the devs were not trying to develop a ""game"" persay, more of an ""experiment"" or ""aesthetic concept"" as the description puts it. That being said, that doesn't excuse OutDrive from having a mechanic that really irritates me and that really is a shame because funnily enough, it's one of the only mechanics in the game. The mechanic in question is the fact that you have to balance out your speed so that your girls heart (which is hooked up to the motor) doesn't overheat or get damaged. On paper this sounds like an excellent idea and I can kind of see where they were going with it. However it means that you can never buildup speed and you must constantly slow down to make sure that your girl doesn't die and end the game. There is also almost no obstacles anywhere and even cornering is ridculously easy due to the slow speed you are forced to move at. This one gripe could be easily be fixed by either eliminating this mechanic all together or just creating a seperate mode where you could drive as fast as you like (hoping the devs add this in the future!). Conclusion:I'm going to recommend this even though I don't beleive it's worth the full $3 CAD. For 99 cents I'd pick it up, but anything more and you're bound to be disappointed, as there's only one mode and it gets tiring very quickly. Thanks for reading, and if the devs see this I hope they take my criticism into consideration as I'll be happy to update my review as the game gets updated.			",783,176,40,76,64,10,101

												tldr: great soundtrack but no ost = buy all the artists albums seperately, car handling BLOWS, pointless limited gameplay even if car handling didn't eat nuts, a launcher that doesn't save graphic and control settings, input controls repeated in the launcher for no reason, left+right triggers non-programmable on a xbox 360 gamepad, useless static image in-game pictures of 15+ seperate non-clickable album links, this game should be buried up the devs a$$ and forgotten.Good soundtrack, the game around it is just garbage though. I should've just bought the soundtrack. But guess what. There are 2 links on the game's main menu to buy the soundtrack, and they just lead to 2 different still images of 15 or so seperate unclickable links rather than opening a browser to buy the ost because there is no official ost.I would just listen to the soundtrack in-game but the game, besides just overall being unplayably sucky, ruins the music because it slows it down when the heart rate meter isn't in the middle, which will happen a lot. The car handling SUCKS. The car controls loosely and either wobbles all over the track or gets control locked when you are going really fast, and braking will just make you careen into a wall and slow the music down until you can accelerate fast enough to speed it up again. There is no point to the gameplay either, so even if the car handling didn't blow wang, the game would still only be fun for 10-20 minutes tops.The launcher also doesn't save settings so each time I have to select the resolution and reprogram my gamepad. It's the most recognized controller you can get, xbox 360 pad, and the menu lets you program every button but the left and right triggers. Plus, a lot of the controls in the input options are shown twice for no reason, showing how sloppily programmed this game is.1/10 worthless. Skip and buy the soundtrack. Oh wait you can't. You would have to buy the artists albums all seperately each since this dog sht of a game doesn't have a actual ost.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												This ""game"" is not quie bad. Although I'd rather call it a mini-game. It's endless runner, where you have to ride your car at decent speed to keep your girlfriend alive. Graphics are nice neon-themed, gives a nostalgic feeling to those who lived at 80's. Music is also really nice and climatic and i like how it slows down, when you're riding too slow, and speeds up when you're too fast. Overall it's a good time-killer, but not for long. After 30 min+ it becomes really boring, and the fact that yuo are riding on a looped routr doesn't make it any better. So my recomendation is: buy this game if you like runners and have nostalgia for 80's. If not it will bore you to death.			",309,103,14,34,25,5,36

												I see why this product has mixed reviews.The game itself is meh.The graphics are great and all the animations are very true to the 80's era.The soundtrack itself was worth playing for an hour or so as well since I'm heavily into the 80's retro synth genre.Unfortunately if your car so much as slows down too much or bumps into a wall or obstacle, this wonderful music gets interrupted with a very VHS style sound glitch(this is intentional as a design element, mind you).This wouldn't be that bad if you could maybe turn it off but you can't. At first it's kinda funny because it reminds you of when VHS tapes(if you're old enough to remember them) would lose tracking and make the audio slur for a moment. The novelty of this wears of very quickly when wanting to just listen to the music, though.The controls are somewhat slippery and while they're not that hard to pick up, there seems to be no real option for recovery whenever you make a hard crash. There's no way to reverse the car and once you've crashed into something like a wall of cars in front of you it makes you pretty much S.O.L. Your only option is to just restart the level.It's priced normally at $3 but isn't even worth that much.The best thing I walked away with was the new set of tunes I'll be jamming to in the near future. Ironically enough I feel like this was the REAL purpose of this game. Not to make a decent little quickie you could pick up but more so to expose these retro synth artists(none of which I've even heard of until now funny enough) and get music sales going.How am I so sure? It's a part of the main menu, lol.You want a good 80' style racing game? Sorry. It ain't here.Hopefully that will be Power Drive 2000(the game this one clearly ripped off).You want some good 80's style retro synth tunes? Here you go.These are all the links they provided in the game to buy the music from each artist. These are at least worth it if you're into the genre like I am and definitely worth the money more than this game.https://future80s.bandcamp.com/album/around-every-corner-digital-deluxehttps://soundcloud.com/logic-puzzlehttps://nammusic2.bandcamp.com/releaseshttps://3force.bandcamp.com/releaseshttps://d-noise.bandcamp.com/releaseshttps://soundcloud.com/quasarshttps://wingsofsolace.bandcamp.com/https://spaceinvaderspaceinvader.bandcamp.com/https://retouch.bandcamp.com/https://priusansich.bandcamp.com/You're welcome.

												As the description at the side says: this is not a game. It's more of a music video that happens to be a runner. Gameplay is next to non-existing, driving controlls are slightly off. Having played it a bit more, I have noticed it is actualy randomly genereated from huge sections.  By 30 minute mark, I've met very few obstacles (not counting roadblocks).All that said, I did enjoy this experience - and it is more like a playeble music video, than a game. I'm a sucker for this 1980's neon estethics and 80's style electro pop.			",131,17,1,30,7,1,34

												First of all, i'll ignore Power Drive 2000 in this review, because while similar in the 80s style, i think there's a place for both games.But to OutDrive itself:In general i like the game.The Story is simple but enough for this game: Drive fast so that the girl survives.The 80s style design is really nice and the music is fitting and good.One neutral point is the potential time you can get out of the game.I don't think i'll play it more that 1 hour in it's current form.But at the same time, 1,60€ for 1 hour of entertainment is ok in my eyes.Maybe future updates will bring new contentBut there are also numerous issues: The steering just isn't very good, a very short tap left/right and the car will change it's direction way too quickly.Maybe alter it a bit so that a short keypress will initial change the direction only slightly while increasing the rate over longer key presses.Another big issue is bugs, mostly clipping: My first run lasted 9 minutes, at which point the helicopter created an explosion while i was on a ramp and suddenly i was below the road, falling until the girl had died.On my second run nearly the opposite happened, a helicopter explosion boosted me about 20m above the road where i was able to keep driving and only fell down back to the road at some point 1 minute later (i think there was a ramp on the road at that spot..)TL;DR: I think the game delivers enough gametime for it's price, so i'll give a positive (slightly above neutral) recommendation.

												Is the music good? Yes.Is the graphics good? Yes.Is the gameplay good? No, it's boring. And when i say it's boring, i mean i'd rather watch the old Windows screensaver, (you know the Maze in Win95) for 10 hours and listen to good music, than playing with this.Dear Developers. I get it. You want to promote some cool indie musicians, but let's be honest. We all played with free flash games and mobile games, which had more content than this.

												Speed, sunset and a dying girl on adjacent seat...what's more to wish there? This is a simple game without any difficult gameplay mechanics but that's definitely a pro. Some retrowave tracks are also enjoyable. Though it lacks some diversityt of interesting road events and becomes boring after you ride your car for quite some time. There is also no record saving system or online leaderboards to make it to raise it's replayability. Скорость, закат, и умирающая девушка на соседнем сиденье...что еще нужно? Простенькая, ненавязчивая игра, но тем, собственно она и хороша. Некоторые трэки в популярном сейчас стиле retrowave вполне хороши. К сожалению, игре не хватает интересных механик, событий на дороге и хотя бы банальной записи рекордов, не говоря уже об онлайн списках лидеров, что мешает ей сохранить реиграбельность.

												Save your loved one by attaching connecting her heart and the car engine through a highly technological biocable. Drive too slow and she dies. Drive too fast and the engine overheats and causes pain to her.The art style is superb and there is a bit of change in the scenario and track, at some point you can even chose the path you want, but eventually they will all lead to infinity.Controls are not the best but they do the job, eventhough steering feels unnatural.Soundtrack is what truly shines in this game. Amazing choice of synthwave songs, nothing to complain here at all.Bought for the visuals, played for the soundtrack.6/10 if played without sound.9/10 if you play it with music volume all up.

												This game talks about feelings, You can\'t stop or she will die,You can only drive to the sunset.Drive to fast and she will suffer, Drive to slow and she will die. I love retro music game, the atmosphere is perfect to create the mood. I\'d like if they put a mode to play without obstacles and enemies(if you play long enough, you will meet them) or an option to turn off the music deformation. Enemies will shoot you or drive against you like crazy kamikazes.If you don\'t like retromusic or driving game, stay away from this game. I don\'t know if there is an ending.Maybe If you are in the mood, have beers and you want to leave your problem behind, the price is fair.I traded a game for this, I think that I did an affair.

												If I could in it's current state I would rate this ""neutral"" instead of ""recommended"". I'm not really that interested in who copied who (assuming copying was really done at all) the issue is does it deliver the goods?There is a lot of good stuff here, the music and art style is spot on, no one could seriously fault it. The controls are also pretty well done, the drifting feels great in an over-the-top arcade style way. There is a *glaring* lack of controller support. Really hard to understand how that was overlooked in this day and age - hopefully there is a patch at some point because a racing game with keyboard controls is just ridiculous. The biggest let down is the lack of any actual gameplay. You have a speed gauge you need to keep not too fast, not too slow. You do that basically by holding down the unlimited boost button, ocassionally letting go to go around corners. There are no levels, checkpoints, objectives (at least none that I found) - anything to really give you a sense of accomplishment.All of this needs to be tempered by the price. For the cost of a small cup of coffee I got 10 minutes of vapourwave racing set in a Fantasy Man universe, fair enough - can't complain really. If the dev throws in controller support, a few objectives/levels/whatever, put the price up to about $10, I think they could have a minor hit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												OutDrive is simply ""all style, no substance"". The synthwave aesthetic, graphics and music make the game look promising from the trailer, however, those are probably the only redeeming qualities it has. The gameplay is minimal to say the least - holding an arrow between two points on a graph bar by pressing down the ""Shift"" key and either crashing into a wall or releasing it once in a while to not overfill it. Going fast isn't a requirement either - driving at a snails pace while maintaining the arrow is also completely acceptable. There are pretty much no limitations or any actual challenge besides that, and on top of that there's only a few pieces of scenery put together into an endless track, most of which you see within about 15 minutes of playing. All of that mixed together with unresponsive menus, slow loading times, weird controls and handling make it hard to recommend it as a game. It could have had potential to be better with any kind of incentive to play, but all it's worth amounts to free trading cards.			",233,33,13,20,17,3,19

												With just a little bit more everything, this could have been great.  As it stands, it's just really okay.  The framework is there for an actual solid gameplay experience, as well an audiovisual one, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that it was never fully realized and just left as sort of a ""good enough"" art project.  More solid handling of the vehicle, calibration for joystick deadzones, a better concept of physics, a removal of the overheat nonsense or just boost altogether, more events and a higher frequency of them, more variety in environments... just a bit ""more"" and ""better"" all around would have made this pretty awesome to play as well as look at and listen to.As an afterthought, the claims of it just being an experiment (on the store page) actually just seem like an excuse.  Again, the basic framework is there, but it's like they just lost interest in developing it further.			",597,158,28,51,30,6,74

												I played this game for about 2 hours total. Given the price, I thought the lack of content was fine. It's not much, but still, it's in the low dollar range. There are games with similar depth going for more. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and it fits the aesthetics and environment perfectly, which looks great. When I purchased it, and while playing it, I thought it looked incredibly familiar, but I assumed it was because of a Blood Dragon esque game before it, or something Sega related. The retro VHS aesthetics have been done before in a variety of games. And as far as they go, I thought this was a great take on them.However. I realized too late, having already bought the game and written a positive review of it, that it's essentially a direct rip of Power Drive 2000. As are others in their more recent reviews starting to notice.The similarities are far too many to be a coincidence, and I have issued a refund request out of principle. I recommend that anyone who has bought the game to do the same and I hope no one else falls into this enticing trap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The A E S T H E T I C is pretty good and the soundtrack but the game gets stale very quickly, am satisfied with my purchase so yes, its worth a buy, but only if its on sale, otherwise save your money and buy the soundtrack.

												Bought on G_2_A, if you get this game for 1NZD or less you will be satisfied. You will have 1 hours content for about 1NZD, if you want a game to empty thousands of ours, this not not the game for you. The A E S T H E T I C is pretty good and the soundtrack but the game gets stale very quickly, am satisfied with my purchase so yes, its worth a buy, but only if its on sale, otherwise save your money and buy the soundtrack.

												I don't know why this game has such high reviews.  When I start running it, the view for the car is stuck facing left.  It pauses frequently for no reason.  I cannot control the game consistenly at all using a controller or my keyboard.  This thing should be in early access it feels like a game in alpha.			",88,43,2,13,11,0,3

												Interesting concept, flawed execution.While I like the visual style, the controls are far from intuitive. Worse, any changes you make in the game's launcher are reset the next time you run the game.Once you choose Play on the title screen, you will be greeted by a flickering loading screen, which appears to freeze for a good while before taking you to the actual game. The loading times are really much too long for what such a simple game merits. A game, which has the dubious distinction of being the first to put my graphics card to 100% load... I would not recommend playing this on a laptop. ",1277,501,34,123,109,8,173

												Mechanics are not well explained to the player. Controls are weird. UI is awful. Driving feels ok, but there's nothing to it. You just accelerate and occasionally do a little drift around corners. You're not allowed to go full speed or you lose. BAD MECHANIC. You're only allowed to drive at a middle speed, which is the worst part of the game. Has no end, and no difficulty curve. You'll drive until you are bored and turn it off. The shaders are cool and give an awesome aestehtic. Honestly I don't think it was even worth my $1 on sale.			",105,22,4,9,7,2,8

PROS+The visuals are amazing, and perfectly 80s. I kept slowing down just to watch a section of terrain roll past, and the opening cinematic had a great 80s-noire feel to it. I half expected the car to ask me if I was a bad enough dude to save the girlfriend.+The music is phenomenal, though I wish you could control it at all.CONS-There is literally nothing to do in this game but drive. The only obstacles are turns and jumps, and because of how terrible the controls and handling are these obstacles will usually end the game.-The car handles like a brick on crisco. While holding forward it shimmies left and right for no reason, even on straightaways. While drifting (the only other control in the game) the tires' friction spikes and drops randomly, meaning you need to mash left and right to avoid slamming into a wall.- Touching a wall at all is like running headfirst into a tree. There's no grinding around a curve, you just get slammed to a stop and, usually, turned around. At one point my car flipped on its side, and the game decided that was my new road. I was only able to drive straight up into the air until the meter dropped and the game ended.- There's no validation on the randomly-generated road. A jump can spawn that fires you directly into the wall, at which point you get to choose whether you hit the barricade and lose or take the jump and lose.SUMMARYThe game is, unfortunately, not fun. It looks and sounds awesome, but the gameplay designer seriously dropped the ball here. I understand it wasn't meant to be a game, just an ""aesthetic concept"", but the bugs and shoddy controls ruin the experience completely.PS: After 8min there's a couple more obstacles: a helicopter and a city street. The heli shoots at you (which does nothing) and fires rockets that spin you around and throw chunks of debris onto the street. Neither is too bad, but if a chunk of debris lands on you while you're spun out you can't turn around in time to avoid losing. Heli spawns every 8min. City street materializes cars in front of you that act like walls. Still not really worth the time.			",295,54,6,62,18,3,39

												Outdrive is a game you would really only play if you're bored and have nothing else to do.  It's fasted passed and has good music, but it has no instuctions/guide whatsoever making it very confusing to play at first.  After you understand the controls and objective of the game it is kind of fun.  To me this was worth buying, but I did get it 90% off so...			",13,7,1,1,3,0,1

												Decent endless driving game. The entire aesthetic of the world around the track is great, all looks super pretty, gives a good atmosphere, music is fairly good too - it hasn't turned the 80s dial quite all the way to max but it's getting up there.It's comfy, which is all you should really be looking for from this game. The driving has no depth to it, it's all straight forward and super simple, and the course doesn't pose much of a challenge, so it's not the kind of thing you should be picking up if you're looking for that.My main complaints would be the music slowing down when your engine slows down too much - I get the point of it, most of the songs just sound bad slowed down - and the inability to actually save the girl, makes me feel kinda bad everytime she dies.For what it's priced at, if you're looking to just chill and be comfy driving mindlessly for a bit with a good atmosphere, I reckon it's worth it.

												Possibly the only endless runner game I'll ever play. Despite the controversy around the game that seems to be brewing in the community, the game itself is a pretty relaxing affair with some very stylised and fitting 80's inspired synth-heavy music. Visuals are great and hypnotic and it's pretty nice to just phase out and take it all in. However, the game does play like a poor man's, bare bones Distance. If you're looking for complexity in a racing game such as this, you wont find it here. The gameplay is very limited and would probably bore most gamers after 10 or so minutes.However, I have fallen oddly in love with the game. It's very much an audio/visual experience than it is a video game. Choosing style and [dare I say] aesthetics taking into consideration before gameplay, depth, and plot. Game would be a lot better if the controller setting were a little more optimised, as using the WASD keys and SPACE to drift around counters does feel a little clunky. Would feel much more smoother and a little more versatile on a controller. I'm pretty sure most of the keys are mapped, but I find that the boost button is off, patch that and I'll be happy.Vaporwave update, when?			",331,39,8,21,13,1,9

												For £1.19 this is great. Keep in mind it is just one level, But the aesthetic is fantastic and the music and controls feel right and responsive.  I had been made aware of OutDrive's exsistance by Hunking love muscle ""Jim Sterling"" A man with  the gaming dexterity of a manatee. After watching him fumble with the controls and thinking i could do better i decided to purchase. Realising after the first minute that infact the game is far easier to controll than he'd made out, i settled in and really began to enjoy it.Reading the reviews below i see that many peope think that OutDrive has been plagiarized from another game in development and i have to admit i had to chuckle to myself. Dont get me wrong i clearly see the resemblance. However i have to apreciate the irony of calling out a game for plagiarizing another game who is in turn plagiarizing every good idea and design of the 1980's To the developer of OutDrive.... I love this ! i love the style, i love the feel, i love the sound and i want more!Please continue with this and develop it further. I would apreciate higher quality audio and procedurally generated levels would be great, some other traffic with maybe light car combat i feel would also work. Maybe have a look at ""spy Hunter"" from the 80's. One of my all time favorite arcade games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's for 80's synth guys when they have to wait for their women get ready to go out for a real drive to somewhere and only then do you play this game.			",83,3,8,5,3,0,1

												OutDrive is a weird little game. And yes, it IS a game. There are controls, there is an objective, there are a few mechanics, you have to do it.Here's 3 reasons why you shouldn't buy this game.Firstly, this game is almost an exact rip-off of Power Drive 2000 so there's your first reason not to buy it.Secondly, there is little to variety in what happens. 2 Small events happened within the space of 25 minutes. That is not acceptable.Thirdly, the mechanics are broken in all sorts of ways. For instance, you can drive backwards, hold shift and you win.Don't buy it.			",106,14,4,14,21,3,17

I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			",110,35,5,13,9,4,12

												I get that it may be very well made for a quick grab of bucks but... the landscapes are actually cool, the concept is alright, the ideas are there... why couldn't the devs at least bother to create some sort of... satisfaction after a while you drive? I just roamed endlessly listening to... somewhat quiet, music. I enjoyed it for a bit, praised the aesthetics but that's all. Even some simple and stupid lines from the girl or some random ads displayed on the cartels like ""just let her die"" or something else would've been cool...Too bad.Atleast I paid almost nothing for this and have no regrets. Cool aesthetics and somewhat ok music (not all tracks).			",189,35,15,20,12,3,21

												This game is a complete rip off and was nothing of what I expected, the developer ripped a lot of the assets from another game. Just avoid this completely and do not buy into this clone at all. I have evidence that this is not real where the developer even admitted this to be a clone of Power Drive 2000			",44,9,2,3,6,0,0

												As much as i would love to rate this game a thumbs up the consumer inside of me doesnt allow me to do so. This games by all means is a beautiful bright and pleasing to the eyes game sure and the soundtrack, oh god the soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic and almost lets this snorefest slide.sadly thats as good as i can say about the game, mechanics arent too bad for being a unity game(which lets be honest 90% of unity games being sold are total garbage) and the game play is ehhh at best i mean literally all you do is just drive and drive and drive some more, but the mundane part of it is almost cancelled by the great aesthetic, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic soundtrack and the beauty of the game, sadly its a thumbs down for me and only recommended for you to buy it if you are a huge synthpop and 80's fan like me, if its on sale dirt cheap otherwise 3 dollars is not too much for the game but with 3 dollars you can buy other games that you can juice more time out off.Game is nice but sadly its very repetititve and its only saving grace is the aesthetics and soundtrack, to be honest this should come bundled with the soundtrack for the 3 dollars its worth then i would recommend the game, atleast you get sweet music out of buying the game if that was the case			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the aestetics of the game, it looks great and the soundtrack is relaxing, however the gameplay is rather pointless, the goal of the game is to essentially drive forever, and I would be ok with this if there was a plot.You are supposed to keep driving to keep your girl alive as some form or life support, but you dont even know she is there, there is no dialouge or art, other than that on the game over screen. And all obsticals are roughly the same; drifts, ramps, and the occasional helicopter attack, this game has potential, but the entire goal of the game currently is to get a high score, I know this is a small arcade style indie game, but I feel it sould be developed a little more, little things, such as dialouge, more assets and obsticals, and perhaps some challenges or collectables to give you more of a feeling of purpose. Perhaps a race mode against NPCs, or an endless mode where you drive, without the girl.As it is now, I say it is a 6/10, this is because of the nice style, and soundtrack, the content is rather underdeveloped			",87,10,1,12,3,1,2

												The good part 'MUSIC', buy it only if you want to enjoy the music(I love 80s music), as for the rest it depends on the gamer, I have not encountered any crash while playing the game.For enjoying the music just pause the game if you don't want to play it, even after all this you are not satisfied ask for refund. As for the game part, it's endless driving, if your car stops or slows down your gf dies and you have to start again, the game doesnot offer any new challenges, the obstacles are all repetitive.Do not buy the game if you are looking for challenges or a story.Give it a try and look for yourself if this game is for you or not....

												Judging from gameplay and the description of the game itself the music comes first, visuals second, and third comes the game.While the music and visuals are nice, the controls are just not good especially for an infinite runner which is actually what I expected this to be from the beginning and make it frustrating and just not fun.

												Ok, for the start of review, I dont care if troll army will give me mass negative votes!Let's be clear, I see many of you stand behind Power Drive 2000, as OutDrive stole entire concept.First Power Drive 2000 started kickstarted to beg for money, and then went silent for nearly a year, last update somewhere in mid 2015. second their announcement is eye pointer PAYPAL donations. OutDrive passed greenlight same as Power Drive, people voted, with one exception OutDrive didnt beg for money.Excuse me sir's there are a lot of games that have similar gamplay and idea. So even if OutDrive creators was inspired by Power Drive, its nothing wrong bad at it.Lets spit in every RPG that is not Diablo or Baldurs Gate !?You should all grow up and not be jelly on someone's success.Now for review;For money worth pack of smokes you get very colorful retro/futuristic runner racing game.Beatuful colors, 80's beat music, DMC, dying girlfriend... FUN!As for gameplay, well duh, your main obejctive is to fast drive so your loved one who is hooked up with wires somehow dont die. On that way you will at start often crash and she will die only by your fault, but later comes bad boys to shoot you and you will encounter many obstacles in front of you. Overall;Totaly recommending this to everyone who are hungry to have flash-back back to 80'Definitely worth 2,99 ",883,335,29,105,143,8,107

												Awesome visuals, Awesome music, 80s Tron vibe, i recommend this to all out there, Leafy I'm looking at you to have this going instead of surfing while you talk. Controls are very difficult but what fun would this game be if it was easy to drive?, you'ld be bored in about 10 minutes, I like the difficultiness of the controls, keeps it a challenge to listen to good music while driving, if you want a driving simulator go elsewhere, if you just want music get the soundtrack, but if you want a challenge while seeing and hearing nostalgia then buy this!edit:with the new update controlling the car is so much more easier. CAUTION!!!-you can sit down to play this game for a little while, start listening to some great music while driving the 2 Hours pass in the blink of an eye. I do enjoy this game and for the price its well worth it.			",68,19,7,4,44,1,0

												MUSIC - is the main and the greatest advantage of this game! The combination of old school style of car chases from 80th movies + awesome music + very interesting and colorful atmospheric environment - all this makes this game look cool. You can really relax playing it, f.e. after a long day at work or after studies. There is something VERY attractive and addictive in this game. Unfortunately there are some drawbacks: for example - there is no point in playing this game for a very long time, cause not much really changes in the plot of the game (I'd say there is no plot or story at all). I would be very happy to see some changes in the level of difficulty, cause I belive that I can play it all day long without any trouble, cause it's quite easy game. After all, who cares.

												Neon OutRun. Get it before it's pulled.. kidding.As it stands OutDrive is more for relaxation, didn't provide a challenge. Enemies rarely changed and side-paths were limited. Gamepad controls need fixing as well. With further tweaks and additions it could turn into something much better. Other then slamming into a few walls with my on/off $2 keyboard, still had fun and enjoyed the soundtrack. Hard to say no for the price. Quicklook below.

												Your will and passion will be put to the test! Nah, just kidding, it's a very relaxed and beautiful game that I use for de-stressing. Sometimes I look at all my vehicle driving games (not many) and I don't touch them because I really want something I can play to just drive, listen to music and just relax and many of them have things in place that take away from that sort of experience. This game is perfect for what I want! It's really cheap and solidly built, it reflects my love for the 80's neon love aesthetic and synthwave. The game's theme and objective is also awesome and I really just appreciate this whole game for the complete package it is, I love this game!TL;DR: For the price of an energy drink you can save her life.

												OutDrive is an aesthetically beautiful game, with an atmospheric soundtrack that will pull you into the game albeit the game's mechanics need lots of work. Keeping up with the speed you're supposed to drive at isn't tough but it is awfully distracting when you bump into walls and the soundtrack slows down. The best part about this game is the audio, and to punish the player by pulling them out of the amazing soundtrack they were listening to only because they drifted incorrectly is a terrible mechanic. If they can rework that single problem, I wouldn't mind holding my WASD/space keys down for an hour on this neon lit road towards the neon sun. OutDrive doesn't have controller support  yet, and the game's resolution is a bit hard to get right. I hope that the developers intend to fix this soon because I would love to play this game often. Although I didn't live through the 80's, it definitely has that vibe, and if you enjoyed Hotline Miami, you'll enjoy this game. OutDrive has a lot of potential, and it's a must buy for the current price. The soundtrack itself is worth much more than that, and so are the aesthetics. I can't wait to see how much the game will improve over the course of this year.			",35,1,1,4,0,0,0

												First of let's take the comparison with PD2000 out of the park. Yes they look alike but i find that they can easily stand next to each other in anyone's library. I do put an upvote on this one cause at 1.79$ it's pretty fun but i would like to address some problems i didn't think i'll have based on the videos i've seen. Pros: 1. Awesome retrowave vibe, alot like PD2000 but with a endless driving mechanic2. Based on music and works as a music shop where you can find New Retrowave artist. Hope in the future artist will share music thru this game - also awesome collision detection (when you collide the music slows down like on a bad cassette player)3. Intro sequence pretty nice4. Car handles smooth and niceCons:1. Lack of options. Should have key bindings since you accelerate with Shift instead of A2. Lack of information at the beginning. You should know what the controls are from the start3. Lack of controller support, i have yet to find the acceleration button on an xbox controller.All in all i think that people should stop attacking the developer who was kind enough to give a bunch of keys even if the game is 1.79$ who is constantly explaining that he did this for his love to retrowave music and not for the money. Also i see a lot of potential if he chooses to work further on some small updates as mentioned above.So yeah, i recommend buying it			",153,129,3,18,18,1,16

												I bought his game because it looks and sounds amazing, and I just kind of assumed that some driving and/or racing would happen. Sadly, that is not the case. The controls are weird and hard to decipher, and the gameplay once you get going is ""keep driving to keep the passenger alive"". There is no real racing in this game, or really anything to do other than look at the pretty colors and listen to the cool tunes.Message to the developer: put the soundtrack up for separate purchase, it's awesome!

												Well first time playing it. Didn't know how to drive, Had to look it up. Have to use boost to charge the girl up.Was doing well. nearly hit 5 mins. then because I was hitting shift all the time, the game minimized and the sticky key tab came up. I crashed the car and couldnt get away fast enough. Very annoying. Cant find any options or key bindings to change that key. Not sure I will be playing it much if that keeps happening.Good music though. Devs: please add in game options, key bindings and instructions. And then I will give it a thumbs up :)Edit. First time I loaded the game it just showed a black screen until I had the menu. Second time the controls came up.Also just got over 1 hour. so I am happy now.

												NOPE. Expected: A cruisy, ambient driving game with pretty scenery, (""NOT A GAME, AESTHETIC CONCEPT"")Got:* sick.* awful twitchy controls (keyboard),  * jumps that throw you into invisible walls, * obstacles are annoying more than challenging. * Game crashes.* Can't judge progress, just GIRL IS DEAD, GAME OVER out of nowhere.* No time to take in scenery. (The slightest tap left or right sends me towards the opposite wall, the need for constant correction takes focus.)			",92,27,1,7,12,0,11

												With exception of the menus, the ""game"" looks really nice, the retro 80's is spot on, the music fits the theme and it's nice. the problem with this ""game"" is that you will probably get bored in 10 minutes, there is almost nothing to do... you drive and drive and drive, it would be alright if the map, car, something changed with time, but it doesnt so it simply feels too plain, its alright to play it for 5 minutes just to relax and kill some bad vibes from a long day, other than that is just boring.

												not really a game , more an interactive mediaplayer visualization . basically you drive a car and if you get low speed too long your girlfriend will die . the game has a very good soundtrack . this is mostly for 80s flashy colors , neons stuff , and synthetizers lovers . the soundtrack itself justifies the purchase IMO if you love 80s stuff of course			",31,26,1,3,9,1,2

												It works as an ""Aesthetic Concept"", but as such, only held me for about 5 minutes per play session.  I would like to go on for maybe 20 minutes per session, to really enjoy the turns and low jumps set on Tron-esque beach vistas.  However, after a single mistake (both times I gave it a shot), the girl died, making me feel like I was done playing.Even if 5 minutes, this would be a nice experience to relax to, but it takes take about as long to load up the game on my system.Still, the game has very nice tunes and aesthetic visuals.  If this could be converted into an actual game, with some balancing and objectives, I'd put a few hours into it, instead of 10 minutes.			",435,99,4,65,25,1,35

												To start with I could not work out how to move the car at enough speed to last more than 10 seconds but once I realised I needed to rebind the Boost key from SHIFT to another key I found this game entertaining.The car handling is not smooth as it likes to fling itself about a bit but once I got the hang of using the booster to keep it under control I found myself enjoying its unique handling experience.The track varies a little as the game goes on, with the occasional car trying to smack into you head on, a helicopter shooting at you and road blocks.The music was enjoyable and kept the pace flowing.Like some other reviews I did find after about 30min I needed a rest. Well actually I lost it on a sharp incline bend and decided to stop.This is a game I think I will play every so often to relax.If its on sale at a good price then I would recommend you try it.

												This is an interactive music video for Synthwave music (as it says in the description).  But the controls are awful and there is a very narrow margin for error.  Since messing up distorts or turns off the music - there is little chance to actually HEAR the music this is supposedly a showcase for.  Just follow the links in the news post about the soundtrack and listen to the music on Bandcamp or Soundcloud.And don't even think about playing this using a controller, despite it - theorhetically - being a racing game.  The instructions make no sense, and you'll die in 10 seconds everytime until you figure out you have to hold two buttons and steer at the same time - if you even get that far before giving up and asking for a refund.Pros- Cool look- Cool musicCons- Horrible controls- Instructions that make no sense- Tiny margin of error- Inability to actually listen to the music without playing almost perfectly- Very similiar in very particular ways to other (superior) gamesOther games like this that you should probably try instead (Racing and/or Rhythm Games set in a fictional ""futuristic"" version of the 1980s dripping with Neon and mainly focused on music - specifically Synthwave music.)- Distance (On Steam)- Neon Drive (On Steam)- Riff Racer (On Steam)- AudioSurf (On Steam)- Audiosurf 2 (On Steam)- Power Drive 2000 (Coming Soon? to Steam)- Nitronic Rush (It's Free - google it)			",2164,728,65,260,203,18,297

												The aesthetic and the soundtrack are very well done.Unfortunately the game is a broken mess. Ifyou are lucky to get it to load, (Hint: don't press the mouse button when the load screen appears to freeze or it crashes) then you'll experience an uncontrollable car that never seems to go in a straight line, followed by a game over screen. There's no visual clue as to if the girl is alive and how close she is to dying. If there is, then it doesn't work. She just dies randomly it seems and you're dropped out of the game. Not recommended.			",488,161,28,44,49,1,32

												A game that I feel helped bring 80's themed music (Retrowave) genres to light. Runs fluidly, colors are pleasing, and the music is wonderfully nostalgic of a near distant age. But if you want a quick synapsis of the gameplay...You will be blocked, chased, and shot at. But for the sake of that speechless beauty who lie next to you on the fringes of death; you will drive.

												This game isn't really post to be an a addicting endless driver game but I would like to say that this one is relaxing to play. The controls to me I would say aren't great or are bad but I would say they are ok. The soundtrack is fantastic for a driving game and I love the synthwave music. I wouldn't expect much for the game if you want it to be entertaining. The game has a nice retro wave of graphics and a creative way why you need to go fast. I recommend you to play this game if you love the 80s, driving a Delorean, and the new retro wave feel.			",60,2,1,1,1,2,1

												This game, in short, is great. Though, I respect the authors opinion that this is not a game, but an artistic experience. Those who are saying this is a rip-off of Powerdrive 2000, are ignorant. This is a retro/synthwave experience that is wonderful- sadly I cannot justify keeping it despite it's fair cost of $1.99. I do, and I mean it, love this game. Yes, you are driving around the same track, but it didn't get repetitive in my eyes. It was fun, the controls are sluggish, but not bad. No one seems to have caught on that you're supposed to be drifting around turns. Great job, dev. I can tell you care about this project and what it stands for more than the actual money, by the fact you give out keys to people all the time. The artists are great, the songs are great, the dev is great. This deserves a chance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's a strong battle between pros and cons with this game. I'm recommending it simply because the developer did put  time in creating this game. He used his skills to get the word out about some new song artists that are trying to make it in this world. However, there's a lot of room for improvement. This game seems to be more about the music rather than the actual controls or gameplay. The pros:-Colorful, and alive background-Good music-Good concept/story-Cool, easy to use UI-Easy to pick up/redirect yourself if you get stuck (usually)-I do like the concept of when your car stops or crashes, the screen dims (her life is ending if you don't get yer sh#t together man!) and the music slows down. The music will also speed up when your car is overheating.-The ""life"" meter is simple to follow, but has room for improvement. The cons:-The car (controls) does not handle so well at times. (Sometimes if you hit the wall, your car will spin all the way around, but a pro is that you can easily redirect it) It feels like you're skating on ice.-Hard to see road blocks (You may not have enough time to react to it)-Having to redo your settings each time you start up the game (gamers usually like their setup to be remembered)The developer himself mentions above that this isn't technically a game, but more so a music/aesthetic experiement. I do believe that this ""game"" has a potential to actually be a game though. If the developer focuses on fixing it or tuning it, I will definitely play more of it in the future. As I said, the concept is very cool. I also believe the game would be better if we didn't have to worry so much about hitting the walls. You run into them quite frequently. (Or maybe I'm just that clumsy?) But I suppose it's better than falling off the track every 30 seconds.Now if you're looking for an inexpensive way to listen to music and enjoy some neon scenery, here you go. Note: You DO see the helicopter in the game (I found it about 7-8 minutes into my ride, but it isn't too threatening). ",51,2,1,5,2,0,1

												As the game is now, I cannot recommend it. The gamepad support is broken. You need the boost ability, but it doesn't work with a gamepad. That means after the very cool and promising intro you start the game, and die after 10 seconds. No matter what you do, you always die after exactly 10 seconds. Then you switch to keyboard and realize what was going on. The boost simply doesn't work with the controller. But you need the boost to survive. Ok, so I played a few minutes with the keyboard, but it just didn't feel right. The sensitivity is way off, you're just not able to control the car very well. It feels horribly. The drift is also pretty bad. The game has an interesting idea (keep up the speed or your girl dies), a simple but nice art style, and dynamic, speed-dependent music - but the controls eliminate every bit of enjoyment you might have gotten out of it. If they work on this, it might turn out to be a decent game in the future, though. I will give it another try at some point.			",44,2,3,6,2,0,4
