												From the screenshots, you can tell 4x4 Dream Race is not the most modern game. A game has managed to get onto steam that looks like the N64 version of Hotwheels Racing, but with worse graphics. While this game may just seem like babbies first homemade game, googling 4x4 Dream Race's past brings up something much more sinister.The first few results for this game brings up free downloads for it. So you might be thinking, ""Wow MFC Recruiter John, so it's just a free game dumped on Steam as a cash grab?"". Well friend, it gets even worse.This is no ordinary quick free game made by new devs, this title was made to spread adware. When you google this title and it only shows free donwnloads as information for it, you'll see that every single website to download from makes you install their ""downloader"" under the guise of ""4x4_dream_racing.exe"" or a similar named exe. From a known website: ""4x4 Dream Race is a video game distributed through the INSERTADWAREFREEGAMEWEBSITEHERE'S installer. This installer will also modify the user's web browser home pages and default search provider to SAMEWEBSITE'S in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome. While the game itself is valid, uninstalling it will not restore the web settings.""So you have to wonder, how does stuff like this past through the filter? Is there even a filter?

												I like this game, but I cannot recomend it.  This game's intended audience is a small number of people.  Its for those who like games where you cant win.  Its for people who like games that look like they were made in 1990.  Its for people who like perfect AI that cannot lose a race and follow the track instantly, while you are constantly flying off the track,  Its for those who like single player racing games.  Its for those who like only 1 track to race on, so they can constantly practice that one track. Its for those who hate option menus, and like when the game decides the options for them.  Its for people who enjoy repetitive music that is a 4 second track that is on a constant loop.  It is for those who appreciate the lack of story and just want gameplay.  Its for people who like niche games and want to be cool.  Its for those who want to play a game with a nonexistant community.  Its for people who like only one vehicle to choose from.  Its for those that want an experience of a lifetime.  Its for those who want to waste a little money for a bug filled but fun game.  Its for those who buy bad games for the heck of it.  If you qualify for all of those requirements, you should buy 4x4 racing.  If you buy it, buckle up, because you are in for a hell of a time!			",223,51,10,22,30,0,10

												9min of me failing the 1st race (no commentary just game play)

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/313330		

EPIC! ever watch a fail so hard that the only word that comes to mind is epic? well that's this game so if you're a ""angry gamer"" on youtube that rages on junk game or just like junk game here's a gem for you.the graphics are a ok retro psx/n64 type aesthetics, not great but not bad. when you take control of your truck though, the lol's begin. you hold the up arrow to move, the left/right arrows to turn, and shift is your boost. just moving without the boost it's hard to stay on the road but when it's active you're all over the place. it's ok though since you can hit oil cans and fences with no problems though not buildings, or the goal posts you'll need to push past those. going off road makes little difference anyway if you can keep your speed up and hit the checkpoints, though good luck catching the other racers since they all go before the light.

												Many will be surprised, but I don't hate this game. I know nothing of it's history, or how evil the company is or anything, and I judge it only by the gameplay I've played so far, which has only been a few minutes. So far, it's... well, read on.The game makes no sense really. I couldn't even figure out how to beat the tutorials, which never seemed to give me a winstate, or give any information on how to play. There is a ""Help"" section, but this just tells you that you use the arrow keys to move and shift to go 2 fast 2 furious. You can't rebind this, but that's the least of the games problems.The game is ugly, which you could probably already tell, though it's semi colourful and everythings easy enough too see, so I can't complain. I enjoy the visuals personally, but I'm the kind of person who enjoys jagged edges and would prefer games to be made to look like ps2 games rather than crysis or whatever. As for music, I hope you enjoy the one song it comes with! You probably won't though, it's terrible. It sounds like someone made it in a few minutes using samples from a music making program. Good thing you can mute it! (Watch the trailer to hear it)As for the gameplay, I've only played a few minutes, but it's decently enjoyable driving around and racing. The car feels quite difficult to control sometimes, but in more of what I would describe a fun way, rather then an annoying way. It turns really quickly and has good traction, like a remote control car. The AI is pretty much impossible to beat. They are always using turbo and can follow the road perfectly. So, yeah, you can't really win at all, or even see your opponents most of the time. The neat thing is, the game has a decent sense of motion. You feel like you're going fast (if you use turbo). I like driving games, but I'm awful at them, mainly because I can't drift worth a damn. Well, that doesn't exist here. There is no drifting. There's only a turbo button, which as mentioned, makes you go Sanic speed. The game is pretty much broken though, considering how impossible it is to control the car with any sense of being precise, and have the AI is incredible.There really is nothing to this game. I've played for such a short time and really have experienced everything the game has to offer. To be honest, after reading another review of this game, I got scared it might be removed off steam and decided to buy it right away, as it still looked interesting to me, and it sort of is. I like this game, but I know perfectly well it's awful, and not worth the money in the slightest. It's ugly, it's only got 1 terrible piece of music, you basically can't win, and there's nothing substantial to it.  I really wish steam allowed a middle thumbs option here, because while it is fun in it's own way, it really is terrible, and only 1% of the people who play it will get any enjoyment from this game.Oh, and it doesn't have any sort of multiplayer at all, so, you know, 97% of the driving game audience gone right there.

												you know those games that have a point, that have a meaning, that actually make the gamer feel good after playing it.  If you want all these things than I suggest you move as far away from this game as possible..  I don't know where to begin with this game, when the race started all the other cars were already thrust ahead of me... If that wasn't bad enough my car started to drive backward on it's own....  Calling this game bad would be an understatement, this game is on a whole other level.  If you can get past the garbage controls, the car driving backward on it's own, lack of any substance or reason to drive, laps that weren't counting and lets not forget the other cars getting something like half a track lead on you, you are left with a bad game.This game has zero reason to exist, I would congratulate which every college student created this game on a weekend after his real project was lost in a hard-drive meltdown, unfortunately even if this was made over a weekend it would still garner a solid D minus.  This game is so bad and left such a scar on me that I'm certain that when I wake up at night soaking wet and scared this game will be the reason why.Please if you enjoy your sanity don't buy this game.  You'd be better off spending the dollar it cost to buy this game on a used tooth brush at the salvation army....  Avoid at all cost... not enough bleach exist in the world to scrub the horror that is this game off your eyes...			",3666,1526,146,417,520,48,544

												Freinds stay WELL AWAY from this one. If you find this in the Steam Store, pack your bags, volunteer your services for the space programme and try and leave orbit. That is how much AWAY i mean by STAY AWAY. This scam which is a free game on the internet, which always comes with adware and the developer seemed to have sold its soul for that reason.While the game on Steam is valid and adware free, its greatest scam is making you think that it's a fairly descent racer. IT ISN'T. Its just barely ANYTHING. Its so bonely scarce its like staring at Calista Flockhart on a diet, during a famine, at a Crystal Meth Party. The tutorial will tell you the wrong keys, the controls are actually arrows and shift. The customisable options is only change car color and the racing involves beating 5 other cars on a 3 lap race track. Apparently miss a checkpoint and you have to start the whole thing again as your lap will not count.There are four tracks but dont worry you will never see the other 3 tracks. The game starts with the other cars being faultless with Star Trek warp drive abilities. By the time you start the other cars will be nearing the finishing line. The background is mainly foggy to hide poor rendering and some of the trees on closer inspection dont seem to be connected even to the ground.In fact the developer probably made it impossible because there are no other levels, only a hint that there is more than this one level. Why do I say that? Because there is only one soundtrack in the game which will make you want to bury your head in the ground as quickly as possible like your some type of ostriche. You'll head bang the concrete constantly begging the noise to stop.The worst part is Im NOT EXAGERATTING. Its REALLY THAT BAD!!!!The game is made up by this company http://www.dream-up.eu/ Its a ruse of one person. In final the only 4x4 dream i have now comes in the way of a piece of timber and the developers head.			",1239,552,53,82,123,5,127

												Let me start out by saying that I won this game in the winter sale auction, and only bid on it because it was the cheapest game up for auction. With that out of the way, I will say that this game is god-awful. I don't know how much it actually costs as I am too lazy to check, but no amount of money is small enough to be fair for the experience I had with this. Steer clear of this game at all costs.

												This is my alltime favorite game now, don't mind the other reviews, they're all stupid and can't see the brilliance that is this game.  For years I have strived in my plight in order to find the ultimate game in this universe and with this amazing game, my plight is over.   Words can't describe how amazing this game makes me feel, ever since my father molested me, I can't get an erection without an amazing stimulus like me gave me.  If you want to feel like a princess being lovingly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by her prince, this is the game for you.  This game will break your castle down and make sure that your vagoo won't sit right for years to come.  Anyway, this game is definently worth the five dollars, I'd personally pay five dollars or more for something that made me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the way this did.  Have fun with the game and treat it right.
