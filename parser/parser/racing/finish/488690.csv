												If you've played Trials then you know what to expect, but it's really more like a modern Excitebike. Looks good and plays good, give it a shot.			",438,116,27,53,48,4,66

												Not my favorite genre, but still i love this game. My last motogame was like gravity defied on old mobile phone, and like on old days this game is all about ""easy to learn - hard to master"". Pure fun also included, try this out.			",38,5,1,7,7,0,12

												This game is very very fun! Once you finish the first boss you have an entire world filled with dirtbikes, epic stunts, awesome crashes, amazing graphics, and the amazing power of sweet sweet nitro! I recommend this game to every person who loves dirt bikes and loves games filled with energetic racing! I very well do reccomend this game!			",95,2,8,1,14,0,0

												I like it. It's a trick filled Trialslike game earning nitro boost as you do tricks. Be prepared to race each track multiple times to learn the track in order beat it and unlock the next race. Nice graphics, nice sounds, good competitive AI. Pure Arcade fun! Also compete against other players scores and ghosts, not live action, but still fun trying to move up in the rankings.Worth the full $20 price in my opinion.			",108,19,12,3,20,7,4

												After I started playing this game for 5 minutes, I immediatly got hooked. It was fast, fun, exciting, and it takes skill and fast reflexes to beat this game. It still has bugs and glitches, but these can be patched. Overall, I'd say buy it and definitely buy it if it's on sale.			",9,3,1,0,2,0,0

												Hard to get used to at first, but when you get the hang of it it gets really cool and competitive even if playing agaisnt bots. Doing all the tricks and at the same time not falling on your head is pretty challenging! Also, but not least important, the graphics look astounding!			",41,10,2,5,2,0,2

												This would have been a great game BUT please be aware that when you do go to play the controls are: to lean forward press up and to lean back press down and cannot be changed. In the options menu it stats the opposite. Let me know if they ever fix this or offer the option to change it.			",15,4,3,0,1,0,3

												This is like those free cell phone games. 3rd person, no steering, on, off, forward, back. I will never play this game, arrgh. There should be some type of demo so people know that this is no riding game, it's a watching game. Paying for this was a big mistake.			",26,0,5,0,2,0,2
