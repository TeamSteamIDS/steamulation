												- WTF is this game, so SLOW it felt like i was at 5FPS when in reality i was with 1500- Nothing like advertised in the video, unless its some kind of bug? I can play GTAV but this game runs slow?- Poor graphics- Confusing tracks- The plane even feels akward/misplaced sometimes, real clunky gameOverall - 1/10 ",1719,690,48,123,182,14,223

												There are way too many bugs in this game to enjoy it. Even with those fixed I wonder if my review would be any different...High On Racings is bad game. Not only because it's short (only 15 levels, which can be completed without any problems), but it also looks bad and doesn't have interesting gameplay. There are levels where ground plates shows incorrect turns and places where you will be trapped without any way out, forcing you to restart level. The achievements are way to easy to get (just beating levels to get them) and making some high scores aren't so hard too - ""thanks"" to some levels and this one trick you can use.I don't feel that High On Racing is even worth to get at 1/10 of price, so I suggest everyone to stay away from this game. There are plenty of better indie racing games.			",1735,712,60,244,224,20,321

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			",110,35,5,13,9,4,12

												Hm... for an indie game made 10 years ago, It's not that bad.High On Racing Time and points racing runner with obvious retro looking, and fairly good music. But leaderbord surely can provide short runs of fun.Do I recommend it?! Yeah, but only on big discount.Pro's:+ Can run on wooden computers+ Fun in short playing runs+ AchievementsCon's:- Price- This game is crying for Co-op- Overall graphic and textures- Should be released way more earlier than 2015			",883,335,29,105,143,8,107

												Alright, so yes, I received this product for free. Because of this wonderful group that gives away free games to basically anyone who wants one! Feel free to joinAccidentallyReviewed hereLet's see, I put about 12 minutes into this game and I could already tell, that it is not even worth the price. List of Pro's, then list of con's.Pros:- If you are a little kid, this would be fune- Reminds me of games I used to play when I was 6 or 7Cons:- Way over-priced (never would I pay for this)- Plays like a free to play game- A few maps, but all are basically the same thing- Graphics are horrible (though it is a 2006 produced game)- Very few options to choose from.Would I recommend this game? Hell, no. If you have a younger one maybe, but it seems to be way over-priced so I would not budge for it.			",82,9,3,3,10,0,6

If you expect a typical race game it will disappoint you but if you don't expect anything from this game you are going to be positively surprised. If I was you I wouldn't pay for this game .

												Concept is not that bad, but influent gameplay (it says my FPS is like 120, but feels like less than 12 actually). Camera behaviour is well... not what you expect and want. Somehow slow.Music is not pleasant.Graphics are simple. That's not really a con for me.Game was released in June 2006 as Steam says, so I'm kind of surprised of 'poor quality' anyway.
