Early Access Review
								Told you I was willing to update my review, and the day has come.I must say I am impressed by the developer in terms of willingness to communicate and learn from what is said about their game.Within an hour of posting my review and video they took the list of issues I outlined and had summaries/fix ideas for them.After playing the game since the update I'm changing the review to a recommendation. If the developer continues this level of community interaction and showing they are willing to work on their product, then things can only get better.Feel free to check out the gameplay improvements in my updated video:

			Felt like it was time, after an update, to take a second quick look at Acro Storm and see if the developer had fixed the issues I brought up in my previous video. Good news!		

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           OLD REVIEW BELOW:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shows potential, but these few things definitely need working on:-Can see loops and jumps in map preview, yet don't see them in game-Random changing of position with no AI passing or being passed, ruining the sense of doing anything in the game.-No music-No in game list of controls-Ability to fall through floors, go through walls and end up outside the mapI hate to be harsh on an early access game but at the moment I can't recommend this. Willing to update my review if changes are made to improve the game.If you want to see some gameplay and more thoughts check out my video:

								I bet most people would describe Acro Strom as ""Wipeout and Mario Kart had a baby"". There has recently been released some amount of anti-gravity racers but there aren't many hoverbike games, which in the end are quite different things. You don't use air brakes here, and genereally the game is more arcadey and generally it does not feel like it wants you to train it every day for many hours to become a better pilot, as is the vibe that I get from most anti-gravity racers. This game feels to me that it prioritizes having fun (instead of the ""simulation-level skill needed in order to race in these speeds""), via really-easy-to-grasp mechanics and fantastic sense of speed, nice music and personal presentation. This game really feels that it could have been in the arcade right between Hydro Thunder and Crazy Taxi, and I mean this in nothing but in a good way.I have been looking for racing games with one criteria: Let me feel the high speed. I want to go fast! Personally I don't get the sense of great speed in for example any simulation type of games. I want to go faster! And in my research there are only a handful of these kind of games available on PC. Acro Storm manages to be one of those.The game being in pretty early development there is not too much content and as per usual with EA titles, don't buy this game if you are expecting to get many hours worth of content or if you are impatient or if you can't stand of any inconveniences (such as lack of tutorials, little bit weirdly acting powerups, little bit ""messy"" HUD, not rebindalbe keys etc.) Let's just say that there are pretty rough edges, but the good core is there already. I would describe the current state as a ""sample"" of the fruits of the development this far, and I am generally very cautious about EA products, I only buy them when I feel I want to support the developers for what they are doing. Nevertheless, the game already offers nice kicks from speed and shows alot of promise with it's personal style.Now, why do I recommend the game as of now?+That feel of speed.+Piloting (Or is it driving? Surely not flying?) feels pretty good.+Nice music (even though not particularly my favourite kind, it fits in the game/atmosphere well)+Personal look+Tracks and environments are nice (and promising in regard to future tracks).+Price is really fair at this point.+Support the developers for doing this hoverbike game (because hoverbikes are preeetty cool don't you agree?) which is a rare genre and not doing a 16-bit roguelike platformer or a open world survival game. In the end, if you buy early access titles you don't just buy the game for what it is now, you buy it with a promise that it will get better, and you will buy it because you want to give your support. Also it is already fun to play, so there is that thing too!			",160,16,9,11,7,2,1

								It was just kind of bland for me. It's a pretty well made game as far as Unity goes. I can't justify the price for the content you get though. The variation isn't that mechanically different, but visually. Not my cup of tea but it might be yours.3/10 Anakins ",587,270,20,56,67,4,65
