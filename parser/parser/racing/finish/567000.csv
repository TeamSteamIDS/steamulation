												I honestly can't recommend this, not even to fans of idle games.  The translation is comically off, the game does not start up properly half the time, and the third assistant does no damage.  Poor experience all around.			",71,16,3,26,11,0,11

												Potentially good idle game equal to those you can find on Kongregate, ArmorGames etc. BUT it only runs when focused. Idle game that is paused when you minimize the window? And paying for it? No, thanks.			",59,1,4,19,2,0,10

												While visually more interesting than some other clickers, there's not much going here. The English translation is a laughably bad google translate. On the bright side, it costs less than a pack of gum and doesn't have any microtransactions that I can see. Plus the names of the enemies are silly. HOWEVER.The game only runs while it's in focus, so it's useless as an idle clicker. Hard pass.			",211,70,5,35,26,2,25

												tl;dr - there are way better idle / clicker games you can get for freeLong version:There's two things making this game completly useless in terms of an idle / clicker game.1. If you click outside the window the game pauses... which is probably one of the last things you want an idle game to do.2. I'm not sure if this works from the beginning or if it's linked to some prestige tokens i already spent... however:get 270 fuelbuy a bot as supportgo to main menuinstantly start the game againgrab the bonus shown on the left sideenjoy your ~40k+ fuelrepeat as often as you like and maybe even soft reset while still in area 2bonus even gets larger as you get more support units and advance further in the gameAdditionally the background and the car graphics get repetitive rather fast and the english texts contain some obvious mistakes even I as a non native speaker recognized at first glance (missing words for example).On the plus side there is decent or at least fitting background music, it's cheap and there are no micro transactions. Still this doesn't make up for a good game and there's tons of better idle games you can play for free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, no matter what. DON'T ATTEMPT TO 100% THIS GAME! This is a bad game. The setting is pretty interesting, but that's all and its executed poorly. The balancing issue is also a problem, you can only get level 2 of each assistance and then the price skyrockets. You don't get as much fuel from the cars to upgrade, so you have to grind a lot. My biggest problem with this game is: The killing animation. If this game is like other clicker games where monsters come up immediately after getting killed, I would have completed the game much quicker, but noooooo, it has to be long, especially if there's a fuel truck. Overall, it's still a bad game, but you can play it a little just for the laughs, just don't try to 100% it. (unless you wanna have the hour count like me)EDIT: apparently semi-curse words aren't allowed, so I changed that.			",456,150,15,40,48,6,48

												i hoped more out of the game, While not expensive a lot of free clickers are better then this game.Upgrades are to liniar and simple and the worst part is you need the game in focus.Futhermore the game has some bugs but those can be solved over the time.i cannot recommend it			",1000,317,26,260,133,7,244

												I like idle/clicker/incremental games. Therefor, I am used to almost no content/story and some bugs, since this is no genre for AAA-title. But the only thing I am able to like in this game is the Mad Max setting.- Translation errors / inaccurate desciptions of spells/achievments- bugs like having a counter running into negative numbers without unlocking- upgrades are resetting to level one or having not the inteded effect- boosts like dps boosts aren't shownWell, without heavily patching of this game, I can only recomment to avoid it.

												Tapocalypse a clicker game. Period. It's tagged on Steam as ""Racing Indie RPG Simulation Clicker"" but at the end it is should simply say Clicker.Gameplay:Set in a post-apocalyptic game you play as a someone on a rugged vehicle who kills enemies spawning continously from the left, via clicking.That is all there is to it. There are a million levels and upgrades but game boils down to just clicking.Graphics:Graphics look good, it's a game made in Unity. The design and game aesthetics are great.Music/Sound Design:Music is good but repetitive and the sound effects are well made.Pros:-It looks good.-Lots of upgrades.-Endless level ups.Neutral:-It's a clicker...Cons:-No matter how many upgrades and level ups there are, the entire game just boils down to clicking.Conclusion:If you like these sort of games, go for it. Knowing that the game is all about clicking, and possibly destroying your mouse's microswitch in the process :P, you can make an informed choice.As far as clickers go, it's a good one. It looks good, it sounds good, it has that endless gameplay setup.Score:Gameplay:		2/10Graphics:                 8/10Music/Sound:	        7/10Concept/Story:	5/10More game reviews @ https://cassus.org ",684,403,4,151,55,6,137
