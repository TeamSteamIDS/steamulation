												Nimbus is a lot of fun and very pretty, and it's basically just as challenging as you want it to be. There are a lot of optional levels, you can configure how you want the checkpoints to work, and your time records don't unlock any content or anything so it doesn't matter if you don't care about trying to accomplish them.However...If you _are_ interested in time records, be aware that Nimbus has one enormous bug: it bases its records on how much time elapses in the real world between the beginning and the end of the level, rather than how many game ticks pass in that time. So depending on how powerful your computer is, falling through the same vertical space without pressing any keys may take you anywhere from 4 seconds to 30 or more. Lowering your resolution and turning off graphical effects can help with this on some of the levels, but these are not adjustments you should be forced to make to fix a gameplay issue.

												Nimbus is an almost perfeect game. The sense of momentum and the feeling of zipping through the air is really fun. Shooting out of cannons, bouncing off of launch pads, diving from great heighs; it all feels good. The game introduces new mechanics, level features and techniques steadily throughout the game, so it's never stale. The music is great, and suits the relaxing and exhilarating aspects of the game very well. Collecting the coins and completing the scrapyard stages after finishing the main game is also very rewarding and satisfying. The graphics/art style are also superb.Only problem I had with the game was that the boss battle felt a bit out of place, turning the game from acrobatic/racing game into bullet hell for the last level.

												Colourful, accessible arcade action puzzle game where you manage thrust and inertia to steer your little spaceship thing through a gravity-shifting crazy golf obstacle course to the exit tile. Of course there are optional extra collectables along the way, alternate exits to alternate worlds, Super Mario World style, and enough new hazards and abilities to contend with that it kept my interest long before I ran out of new levels.Works really well as a casual pass-the-pad multiplayer game. It's a lot more forgiving than something like Super Hexagon. Nobody's going to be on for too long but nobody's getting an early bath after five seconds. Well... not often.Feels very much like a game you might find stuffed in a corner in a seaside arcade or find on an Amiga disk with half a Chinese label on it - you'll want to tell people about it, when you remember, but most of them will almost certainly never play it and you're not sure of the name or where you played it.Maybe you should stop smoking weed.

												Nimbus is a glider game.  You don't have an engine, your engine is gravity, and special platforms within the game like bumpers, speed ups or other graviational devices.  The game starts off real easy, but it gets tremendously difficult.  This is not a game for the faint of heart, neither are the achievements.  This is one of the most difficult games I've ever played.  However, the devs did a really good job of programming the physics and of desiging the levels.  Pick this up if you're up for a challenge.

												Nimbus is easily one of the greatest games I've ever played, and certainly the only one I still want to replay.Because Nimbus is all about friction - all about the mechanics of flight and soaring. Playing Nimbus is like riding a rollercoaster in 3D, without rails. It's like reaching your arm under your sofa to grab that single nickel with the tip of your nails. Nimbus doesn't have a physics engine - it has a HOPE engine. Your ship moves by the sheer force of your faith, trying to climb the ever-unsurmountable heights to get to the finish line.Nimbus rewards daring, creative players.Ah, and also it has a kickass soundtrack.EDIT: Stil pretty good come on Steam gimme mah badge			",411,144,9,41,24,6,56

												I guess this is a bit of a puzzle racing type of game. You control a ship and you have to bounce off of panels or use cannons to shoot yourself up. Then you guide your ship across the levels while avoiding things like spikes and crashing down. It starts off pretty easy but it gets difficult quickly. I normally don't really play these type of games (not for long anyway) but I do enjoy them from time to time. So depending on what you're looking for you might enjoy it as well.[Rating: 73/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												I am a bit torn between love and hate with this game. For a perfectionist like i am, its a bit of a nightmare, because some of the levels are really tricky and hard to master (to get all the gold coins you can collect). The good thing is, you dont have to do that if you dont want it =)You can also try to get the best time, on online leaderboards too, so there is a time factor in the game, but it can be also ignored if you dont care about that.The game works flawlessy on my machine. The visuals are pretty and fitting altough not groundbreaking, i really like the different ship designs and effects you can unlock. Also there are sometimes different paths you can take to get to different alternative levels.The controls took me a little while to get used to them, but when you do, its fine. For the asking price this is a fair deal, you get plenty of playtime for the money.Overall i think you might like this game if you enjoy a challenge, because it is really challenging later on =)			",3858,1550,168,486,656,65,666

												Fun, frustrating, clever game.Nimbus sorta plays like a combination of Super Meat Boy, Sonic, and that paper airplane game for your calculator. There are parts where you have to dodge and weave through fields of spikes and projectiles. There are also parts where you have to puzzle your way though mazes, trying to build up enough momentum to get to that just out of reach spot. Expect a lot of aha moments and a lot of times where you want to punch your computer out of frustration.I would recommend this game if you can take a game that doesn't pull any punches.

												Very innovative and fresh game. You steer a glider that follows the basic rules of gravitation (speeds up if it falls and gets slower if you try to pull up). You can only turn left or right so the handling can get very tricky in close situations. If you hit spikes or come to a total halt you lose.

												buggy piece of garbage. it looked fun, but crashed constantly- would only run in 1024x768 in windowed mode (and that's after I deleted a config file just to get the game to run in the first place), and then it's stuck in ""demo mode"". Found a thread from 2011 where somebody ran into the same situation and the solution was to shut down steam and delete one of *steams* files (not the game's files). I backed the file up and tried it, didn't work. This game has been out long enough for crap like this to be completely inexcusable. If you see this on sale like I did, save yourself the headache, or at the very least try it within the refund period to make sure it works!! I didn't realize there was only a 14 day window for refunds, so here I am on the 18th day finally getting a chance to play it and now I'm stuck with it.			",259,60,3,17,17,3,22

												1/10. Game blows. Ignoring the questionable game design, the main premise of this game is to challenge the player with awkward controls. Both in game and out of game (settings). For example, configuring the gamepad is not intuitive--how do you delete a mis-binding to multiple keys?--and no in game keyboard remapping. Stupid! Fortunately, I didn't pay very much for this game, but it was too much. I may revisist this title to give it a second chance, but doubt it. RGH			",382,104,2,48,17,1,53

												I would call it a puzzle platformer, except there is no platforming involved because you can fly. However, it is a puzzle game that involves skill similar to platforming. The game looks cute and relaxing, but is anything but. One of the hardest games I have ever played (I haven't play dark souls though). If you like repeating one bit over and over again to get a better time to repeat another level to get a better time ad infinitum to attempt to get one of the top global averages you will probably love this game. Only lacks one thing, and that is a custom level creator that is integrated with the Steam workshop. This isn't bad though as there is plenty of hard levels to play after the main story is beaten. If you are worried about not much content don't be.			",94,18,2,19,20,1,44

												Nimbus is the kind of game you play obsessively to beat your best time, the sort that satisfies the soul of a speed-runner; yet it has a satisfying serenity to it all, too. Hard to describe, easy to understand, this is one of those quirky puzzle / skill games that sticks with you (catchy music & all).			",93,23,4,13,28,1,42

												Some of the best level design of any game I've ever seen. Subtly changing strategy can swing the difficulty massively. Movement of obstacles in the level is very finely timed to allow for fast solutions, as well as being friendly to those who want to progress at a more leisurely pace.			",183,32,6,4,11,2,48

												This game is a game that involves thinking and patience(patience isn't a word that describes me tho).So basicly you get this ship that obays gravity and you can't really make it go up, you can make it slow down when it goes down tho.You must get to the finish line, without dying(this is a challange in later levels like world 3).You should get it for yourself, it's fun and it passes time by :)My rating: 8/10			",142,32,17,8,23,6,31

												nimbus is a physics based puzzle type game where you control a rocket ship. you must naviagte to the end of the world utilizing momentum. the game slowly introduces new gameplay mechanics such as bouncy things, spikes, and vortexes. i never felt bored playing the game because it's fairly difficult and mechanics are introduced at a great pace. overall, if you like rockets you should buy this game.

												tl;dr: A gravity-propelled spaceship meets Super Meat Boy-like challenges.Nimbus is no doubt one of the most tragically overlooked indie games on Steam. You're a little spaceship trying to navigate charmingly rendered 2D-levels to reach the goal (and if you like, find the cleverly hidden coins). There's only one problem: your ship has no method of propulsion. Instead you'll have to make use of sparingly placed cannons (which also serve as limited-use checkpoints) to gain momentum and propel yourself around the stages. This is a game to return to again and again, with tons of content to experience even after you defeat the last boss.			",187,80,7,31,13,2,47

												This game will make you your ♥♥♥♥♥. In a good way. Basically, you guide a ship which can't control itself. You gain momentum, hit bounce pads, shoot out of cannons, avoid spikes, hit switches and all that jazz. It controls just fine and is not at all frustrating because of that. Some the levels (specifically, about half to 2/3s of the way through) are ♥♥♥♥ing long and you need to commit 'em to muscle memory. There are checkpoints if you play on easy or normal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but hardcore dudes like me and Strudel will play on Hard all the way through.If your liable to get frustrated by this kind of game then probably wait until it goes on sale. There's a demo coming soon so try it whenever it's out.			",226,69,7,39,13,3,41

Chances are you havn't playyed anything like it before. I loved it and have played though it at least twice. Very fun up beat music. great cartoony visuals. Cosmetic unlocks. Classic mario style overworld. Challanging but fair.			",705,163,26,77,53,10,129
