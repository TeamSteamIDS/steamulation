												Jumps is an indie game in the truest sense of the word. It wasn't made by a studio of people with game design experience and instead was primarily made by one person -- with help on the soundtrack, of course.Jumps is a Unity First-Person Platformer and you can kind of get that feel when you play it. However, Jumps defies tradition by locking the jump function behind ""tokens"" that you find in level. This transforms the traditional tension of jumping at the right moment and it makes it more complex. Knowing when and where to use your jump turns this game into an incredibly fast-paced puzzle game in which you look for the various paths available to you in each level. Sure, some levels are more linear than others, but there was a surprising amount of diversity in options that were provided in levels throughout the game. Following the path of tokens can show you the depth put into the minimalistic levels that spread across the 60ish levels.Actually, if I were to form one concern about the game as a whole, it'd probably be that the game is a little short on content. For people who are looking to stretch their money as far as possible, then this isn't necessarily the game for you, but that doesn't mean that it's not good. It's a game that thrives on you wanting to refine your times and because of that it makes for a great speedrun game. Consistent physics rules and worlds to navigate make for optimizations in your play that keep you learning and enjoying your time in game.It's also worth noting that Jumps has a solid soundtrack! It's just catchy and nice to listen to.Overall, Jumps is a delightful game. People who enjoy first-person platformers and refining their times will enjoy their time in this proverbial needle-in-a-haystack. If you like the genre, then it's a must pick up, and if you're unfamiliar with the genre, then it might be a tough game to beat, but that makes each victory all the more sweet.

												I am the Soundtrack Manager of the game 'Jumps'. I received the game free to play as a member of the development team. My review will be of my own personal opinion and does not represent my standing as a developer for the game.Jumps is a unique, fun, and challenging game, with many paths to take to enjoy the game in different ways. One path too hard? Try another one. The game starts off easy, with close to no difficulty, but does ramp up the difficulty after a short period when you've learned how to play.The game looks easy at first look, as in the trailer, and I thought I'd be a pro, but that was not the case. Half of the levels I can't even beat. So you're not getting an easy victory here. If you're someone that likes a challenge, this game is for you! ",56,3,0,3,2,0,0

 Really cool game  This game is quite cool and also really fun. Although the graphics are quite simple, they look good and fit perfectly. The music is also good. Another thing I like about the game is that it is actually quite challenging, with the time limit that you need to beat for each world before you can go on to the next one. It also has some pretty cool ways to get from island to island, like trampolining and boosting yourself using a gun. LOTS of fun, would definitely recommend you buy this if you like this type of game.			",14,3,1,0,0,1,0

												I was an early alpha/beta tester of this game and received the product for free.Jumps is a game about speed running through levels of floating islands, only being able to jump when a token is picked up. This game will remind anyone of cluster truck. There are currently six worlds, each with 10 different levels. They start easy, and become progressively difficult. Each world can introduce a new concept, may that be trampolines, giant fans, cannon jumping, bounce plates, spikes, giant bullets, hidden traps and huge spinning blades. The game provides easily hours of fun and a great depth of difficulty. Each level has a kind of set rout, but you can spend many more tries working out a better way. The soundtrack is amazing, specifically made for the game, and fits in with the retro, speedrun theme. The dev of the game communicates with anyone and is open to comments or just for a talk. Join the jumps discord at https://discord.gg/ru8mpdYThe only problem I have with the game is that sometimes the rocket jumping and trampolines are difficult to reproduce the same results everytime, sometimes you get small or huge boosts. Overall a great game, great looking, great playing. Easily worth the mere 5 dollars. TL:DRPROS:Great graphicsAmazing musicGreat depth in levels Good dev contactLarge amount of replay ability when trying to beat timesCONSSome times certain techniques are a bit bugged			",53,7,0,3,13,1,11

Jumps is a first-person platforming game with a polygonal art style and rocking music.TL;DR at bottomWhen first viewing the trailer for this game, I was instantly reminded of ClusterTruck. It has similar art style and gameplay mechanics. Now, after playing the game for about 45 minutes, it does have gameplay and physics similar to ClusterTruck, but without the trucks.The menu is pretty simplistic, with a few graphical options and audio sliders, as well as mouse sensitivity.There are 6 worlds, each containing 10 unique levels, bringing the total to 60 levels. I finished Level 10 of World 2 before finishing my play session. Each level I played presented varying levels of challenge and diversity. Some levels were quite enjoyable, as they took advantage of the physics very well, like sliding down a hill then using your momentum to fly off a ramp.The main feature of the game is arrow pickups, which grant you a single jump. You must use these jumps to strategically traverse the floating islands and other objects to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. Now, there was one other power-up that I did encounter, a speed boost, which increased my running speed and momentum by a substantial amount, and was lots of fun to fly around the level very quickly. I am unsure if there are any other power-ups that can be found in later levels, but I would assume that there are.In addition to the jump pickups, there are also different types of jump pads. I encountered a red jump pad, which simply mimics the effect of the player's jumps, and a trampoline that had a smaller jump. The trampolines were hard to use, and the jump heights were inconsistent. One level in the Snow world involved bouncing on multiple trampolines that lead to a slanted trampoline with which you must bounce on and turn around to reach a land mass. I had extreme difficulty trying to bounce off of this trampoline properly and it took me about 10 minutes to finally complete the level. I am not sure if there is an issue with simply landing in the wrong spot, but it was very annoying.The game features a soundtrack that is always playing in the background while traversing the levels, and is muffled on the menu. The music is fun to listen to and adds to the epicness of the gameplay.Jumps has a very interesting concept and it is executed well. There are lots of levels and is pretty easy to get into. At the time of writing this review, there is no price tag as the game is unreleased. Based on what I have played so far, I would probably buy this game for about $4.99 USD. My only concern is there not being any replayability value to the game once completed, but if there are leaderboards for the times players have completed each level in, it could allow for some fun competition with other users.Final Verdict: I would recommend this game to fans of ClusterTruck and platforming games.8/10​TL;DRPros:+Nice, polygonal art style+Good use of physics+Variety of powerups and objects+Interesting level designs+Rockin' musicCons:-Difficult to use trampolines-May get stuck on a world if you can't beat the required time​Game has been provided by developer, review has been written without bias.

DisclaimerI am biased after the key-revoking incident.I will try to remain objective, but subjectivity will likely show.Basic InfoGenre: First-person platform runner.Difficulty: Medium-Hard NarrativeRating: 0/10The game has no narrative element or story. I would personally have liked a reason why I am traversing the different worlds and the story behind them.Any kind of motivation why I should try to beat the maps as fast as possible. GameplayRating: 5/10The Game consists of 6 worlds that each has 10 maps.In order to progress from one world to the next, you have to complete all maps on the current world and have a global time for the world which range from 115 seconds to 145 seconds depending on the world.Each map takes between 10 and 30 seconds to complete and requires you to go from your starting point to finish goal in as little time as possible. Each new world introduces new obstacles, such as swinging blades, fans and canons and aids such as speed boosts, spring boards and trampolines. All maps are replayable and you are able to improve your time on any completed map by redoing them in a faster time.The maps and worlds gets gradually harder as more obstacles are introduced.Some maps can be completed on your first try, while others will have you restart multiple times until you have familiarized yourself with the map.Visual PresentationRating: 7/10Jumps has a low-poly cartoon-style that will be hit-or-miss for most. The game is made in unity and is therefore well-optimized and should run smoothly on most computers.The different worlds has different themes and while some worlds are somewhat similar, others are different and unique.The art-style is most likely what will draw most people to play this game.Audio PresentationRating: 4/10The soundtrack is varied, but limited, and fitting for the genre, but as with the visual style it is very much hit-or-miss. The sound effects are top-quality and fits very well within the genre.While it does have a varied soundtrack, if you are stuck on a level and have to restart it multiple times, the limited soundtrack will get repetitive and annoying.Final ScoreRating: 4/10If you are looking for a challenging medium-hard platform runner with a low-poly art-style, you might like this one.The last 2½ hours out of the 3 hours I have in the game has been decent enough.I personally can not recommend the game due to my experience with the developer, but that does not mean it is a bad game.

												TL:DR, This game is fun as♥♥♥♥♥♥ worth the money, and a great way to get a smile going and have some fun if you're tilted, angry or bored.Jumps is a platform jump game where you jump from platform to platform (How surprising!) in order to finish levels and move up to more challenging stages, it's very simple yet challenging at certain times, and even though I received it for free, I'd definitely spend the 5 to buy it.Being that I was one of the ""beta testers"" for this game I'm extremely happy to see how far it has come since the developer started working on Jumps. I played it before it was available on steam and enjoyed it just as much then as I do now, this game is extremely FUN, and challenging as well in some parts, has a great music selection, a good level selection, and an active developer who cares about the game and it's audience, believe me when I tell you any negative reviews on this game are most likely false and due to a personal incident with dev/community rather than the game itself, having played through a bit of it, I can tell you there are literally no issues, there's nothing I'd fix, it's kind of just it's perfect own little thing, and I appreciate the simplicity of the game, plenty of options for looks and peripherals, and a great overall idea. Pros go as follows.+ Great music selection, well done on this front.+ Good movement mechanics.+ Good level selection.+ Game looks really good. + Levels are mapped very well and give a clear idea of what you should be doing (after dying on a couple 10 times!) There are no cons, this game is perfect as is, I'd also like to quickly mention that semeicardia's review on the game is heavily biased due to a ""key revoking"" situation and asking for narrative in a game where you literally jump from block to block in an attempt to finish levels is ludicrous, don't take this kids reviews with anything more than grain of salt, cheers.Wonderful work bro, keep it up.
