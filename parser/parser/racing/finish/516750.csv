Early Access Review
								In my years ive spent time working on cars. I know enough about them to pretty much know how to put one together so i figured this wouldnt be too bad. Part 1: What a peice of junk. There strewn about me was dozens of engine parts all along the shelfing. I recognize many of them and i think to myself hey, this wont be too bad. 2 hours go by. Part 2: Fear and loathing in finland.I knew nothing. All of the stress. All of the hair pulling frustration and gut wrenching heartake of wasted time is encapsulated perfectly by this game. That point in your project where youre so keyed up you have to just walk away and go to town for a drink at the pub. Its all there. Its the most realistic simulation of a project car that ive ever seen.Part 3: My moment of glory.After 7 hours of toiling. Putting the engine together. Finding a part i missed. Taking it back apart. All of the constant pain and suffering. I finnally lower the engine and transmission into the car body. I find all the linkages and hoses and connect everything. I put in oil. I put in coolant. I put in what little gasoline i have. Not time to hook up the driveshafts yet. i must test the engine. I jump into my bare body car. Id only bothered to put in the basics things. The seat. The shifter. The steering wheel. Id assembled the wheels and such of course. The only missing basic necessity was the driveshafts and probably the exaust pipe. Wasent needed for a test run though. I lean to the right. I hit the ignition. It turns. Turns. Turns. IT HAS STARTED. THE ENGINE HAS STARTED. It sounds horrible. Its missing. Its stuttering. But it RUNS!!!Part 4 Why does this always happen to me. I hear what can... only be described as a slight cluck. The engine stalled. I suppose it had run out of fuel. I look and it had. I try to put some more in and do so. I get back in to start it up. Tickticktick. Its not turning over. I get out and look at it. Then down in the pit over which id parked i notice something. a small part...The starter had fallen out.I recommend my summer car to anyone that has ever worked on a car before. Also to anyone who thinks they know everything about how cars work. Is it 100% full on accurte in every respect? No. I dont think any game can be. But its the closest thing to actually working on a car that ive ever encountered. I now have to pull the engine back out of the car and try to get the starter back on while figuring out what went wrong in the first place. Some projects never end.Oh yeah theres like a survival thing too but i mean. All you have to do is not die like in real life. Some people might find that harder than others. PS: To the creator of this game. If you could somehow make this game or a similar concept in multiplayer i will give you my soul.			",64,5,6,15,26,0,3

I was genuinely excited af.73. the excitment only grows as the postage bill is paid and I see the boxes waiting for me.74. genuine excitement to open the boxes fills me as I head back home75. completly forget about eating, drinking and cleaning as the packages were being opened and parts being installedThis game has surprised me at every turn.  The attention to little details is asstounding.  Two things that really hit me hard.1. the feeling of finishing your project car.  it felt genuine.  you go through the same struggles with a car build in real life.  The game somehow captured the emotions when you complete a car.  It's something you build with your own two hands.  Most people playing this game might not understand this but feeling those emotions again gives me some modivation to go finish my car that i'm building for the 2nd time.2. genuine feelings of excitment when you get new parts for your car.  the whole experience of ordering, waiting, picking them up and installing them is genius.  I never expected soo many emotions from this game.			",121,7,26,6,22,2,9

								Simply put, one of the hardest, most frustrating, most obnoxious games I have ever played.There are no tutorials.Nothing is in English.You know nothing.Suddenly you're dead and broke and your car has exploded.You scream ""F$@# this game"" at the top of your lungs.And then suddenly you figure out how to put your first part together and you scream and cry and laugh in joy.Hours take place and you finally found that missing screw you forgot to tighten, you learn to tune your car and get it to start. It finally stops stalling on you, the engine hasn't blown up yet and you start to drive to your inspection to find out whats wrong with it still only to find out that the only thing that IS wrong, is that you forgot a stupid triangle in your trunk.But its okay, because now its time for an adventure.This game seriously, gives you some of the hardest rage moments in a single player game. But you keep going back for more because its all on you! You have to figure it out and by the devils angel is it hard to do! But once you do, it is the most rewarding and satisfying feeling that I have ever experienced in a game like this EVER. Because no one is holding your hand, no one is helping you cheat your way to victory, it's all you.So go you, and make this happen, make your dreams come true as you build your little $h!^^y car that you almost want to drive off a cliff. But you wont, and in the end, you'll love this game, no matter how many times you rage quit after smashing your keyboard.10/10Can't wait for the future updates!			",170,47,4,36,59,0,21

								This is my first review.I may be a bit biased, because this is my thing. I built a project car several years ago. Put a Ford V8 into a Mazda RX-7. I spent months running to the store for parts, looking for the right wrench for that odd bolt, eating burgers and fries with grease covered hands. I remember the day I first started the car, and the feeling I had when it finally roared to life. I remember how my heart was pounding the first time I drove it around the block. I remember being terrified that it would leave me stranded far from home because I forgot some simple detail in constructing it.This game is the closest you will ever get to that magical journey I had with that car.This game will make stories. Stories that will make your wife laugh. The kind of experiences you hated when you were in the middle of, but tell to everyone you can when you're older.Youy're greeted with a shell of a car and a garage full of parts when you start the game. You build that car, drinking a beer here and there, stopping to eat and have a sauna once in a while. You genuinely have a feeling of pride when you finally get it started. And some excitement the first time you go for a drive in it.The game is very well done, the dev is active as hell and checks the forums almost every day. If you have ever wanted to build a project car, this game is the perfect way to get that feeling. You have to work for it, and it's not easy, but it is maybe the most rewarding game I have ever played. There aren't a whole lot of bugs for early access, the controls take some getting used to, but it's oh so worth it.If you're one of those guys that loves to put stuff together, this is the game for you. For $15 bucks, you can't get that feeling anywhere else.You will make stupid mistakes.You will fail.You will get drunk.You will die.And you will love every minute of it.Buy this game.

								Day 1 - MONDAYI begin in a house located somewhere in what I suspect to be the Finnish wilderness.  Wandering around my home I find a full case of beer and a pack of sausages.  A few minutes later of spinning and twirling the sausages around and I eventually learn how to consume what is surely a healthy diet of warm beer and sausages.  My immediate needs met, I continue to explore around the meager lodgings and eventually discover the door leading outside, only to be met with what looks to be my objective.  The sports car that surely every auto enthuist dreams to have one day, only it's missing every single part that makes it run, being only the car body itself.  In one word: Potential.Stumbling further along, bright eyed and surely confident in my abilities and common sense to attach bits and pieces labeled ""A"" to slots marked ""B"", I find myself in front of what I assume to be the garage doors.  Opening the doors, my dreams and hopes of soon recreating scenes from the classic movie ""Vanishing Point"" are broken and dashed away by the seemingly hundreds of parts and pieces scattered around me with no manual or instructions in sight.  Never having actually worked on a car or engine before, I dive right into assembling parts of the main engine of the vehicle.  Further twirling and spinning, putting rods into slots and disks onto what should be spinning bits, a myriad of nuts and bolts and screws that I hope actually go where I think they need to.  I quickly become bewildered at one stage when I cannot attach a part to where it seems to need to go and submit to the daunting task of building an entire engine from scratch.  ""Why can't this piece go there!?"", ""Did I get all the bolts screwed down!?"", ""You need THAT wrench to do that?!"".  I relent the fact that there is no manual for engine assembly, but quickly reconsider that maybe this game hates me and if it were kind enough to even provide one, it would be written solely in Finnish.I resign myself back inside the home after hours of tinkering and frustration, odd calls from the phone inside the house of people yelling at me in a language incomprehensible to me, and trying to make sense of the world around me, throwing what's left of the case of beer on top of the bed and drinking myself to sleep after what can't be happening, that I'm unable to complete what surely thousands of others have.  Sleep comes.Day 2 - TUESDAYI awake the next morning, my view shaking in what I can only guess to be from the massive amount of alcohol consumed the previous day.  I attempt to rectify this by drinking more beer.  It doesn't work.  I once again venture into the garage to assemble what bits and pieces of the engine are left when my eye catches the bright red bar in the upper left hand corner that I am apparently dying of hunger.  The fridge is empty, no food is in sight.  Panicking, not wanting to lose what work i've done so far I fumble my way into the drivers seat of the working blue van parked outside.  In my desperation and mad dash to where I think the main town is located, I run full blast at 100kmph after being sideswiped on the highway, straight into a tree.  The only memorial I have left to what I attempted is a spot in the newspaper of a patch of grass.Day 1 - MONDAYI begin in a house located somewhere in what I suspect to be the Finnish wilderness.MSC is a very frustrating game.  A frustration that only adds to it's overall charm once you overcome these frustrations on your own, without any kind of documentation, tutorial, or set of directions.  After fully assembling the Satsuma, it's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥car that backblasts and overheats constantly.But it's my piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥car, and I love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was born in 1986, so I didn't have my own car in the 1990s yet, but I remember those times quite well. My grandpa used to have a yellow Datsun 100A and my cousin had a brown one which we used to drive on an icy lake and pull a Stiga sled behind it. I live in a small town in Eastern Finland so I feel right at home in this game. I'm almost expecting to find a Commodore 64 or Amiga or a 486 PC in the player character's room or a lego space police set as a memento of his childhood in the eighties.I remember when we were told to take the telephone cord off the wall socket when a thunderstorm came. I remember that blue camo pattern being used everywhere. I remember my aunt owning a shop that was just like Teimon Kauppa. So this game has got the world just right.There aren't even all that many bugs for an early access game. A lot of stuff that people think happen because of bugs are actually due to them not understanding how to do things. A good general advice for this game would be this: if you know how to do something in real life, you should know how to do it in this game. Don't expect anything to happen with just one push of a button, except for peeing and swearing. For example, refueling the Van doesn't just happen magically when you park next to the fuel pump and maybe press the use button, but instead you will have to open the fuel filler door, unscrew the cap, take the pump handle in your hand and put it in the fuel filling hole. Then you go to the counter at the shop and pay. Just like real life.Only real problem with that is that it's not always immediately obvious how exactly to do the actual details of something, (like for example the precise place to position the oil canister at when pouring oil into the engine) but when you have done something once it turns out to work in a logical way and your subsequent tries at doing that thing will become easier until it's second nature.To someone who doesn't know a whole lot about cars, assembling the Satsuma car will be like a memory game. You will probably watch a video of someone else doing it first, then try to remember the order of parts and the right wrench size. At first you will make mistakes and have your car leaking oil or just not running because you forgot some small detail. Then you will try again and remember a bit more. Then you will die of thirst because you forgot to drink. Then you will remember most of how to assemble the car and guesstimate the rest and have a car that's at least somewhat drivable. Then you suddenly realize that now you know about cars. At least that one specific make and model.The audiovisual presentation is actually not bad for something like this. While the few NPCs found around the map and the tree models look like something from 2001, the main car in particular is nicely modelled and the lighting in the game looks quite nice. The sound effects are just right, and although the voice acting could certainly be better, it does elicit a few laughs at least. The radio plays a variety of music and speech programs that contain a lot of quality Finnish humor. Sadly, they are lost on foreign players. My favorite radio program is Marko Kahjo, a parody and spot-on impression of Markus Kajo.Overall the game is a fun and weird experience. For an early access game made by just a couple of people, the few problems it has mean nothing.			",136,20,34,20,32,0,19

Early Access Review
								I don't normally review Early Access games (and, as we all know, Steam reviews = serious business), but seeing as I'm already more hooked on this than a bunch of feminists on cheap alt-right bait I just can't help myself from writing this surprisingly necessary message in a bottle about why you should or shouldn't buy this game and throwing it into a sea of messages in bottles about how much peeing and crap-sucking is in this game.So, for starters: there's a lot of peeing and crap-sucking in this game, if you didn't know already and really needed to know. There are other things to do - not an awful lot, mind you, but that doesn't matter, because this dev plays the forbidden card - mechanical depth. While in a game like GTA most of what you're allowed to do involves killing and driving (and don't get me wrong - I ♥♥♥♥ing love killing and driving), it will only reluctantly allow you to do things that don't involve killing and driving, such as being a functional adult. GTA is like that friend of yours from across town who keeps offering you weed and gets you to do the stupidest crap more for his own entertainment than yours. Why would you eat, drink and wash yourself when you can run a bunch of people over, blow up a bunch of cars up and still get away with it? In this bizarre slice-of-life analogy, My Summer Car is more like your dad. ""There's no damn food in the house, do the damn groceries and don't forget my beer like the last time. And get a damn job you slob, and I mean a real job, not that rally driver thing you keep babbling about."" Except dad forgot to tell you who you are, where you are, what language you're speaking, how to drive a car and how to get to the store. But you know what will happen if you don't listen.Not knowing how to do things is a huge part of the fun and I don't want to spoil any of it, but let's say if you think Euro Truck prepared you for anything, trust me, it didn't. Suffice to say getting things moving in this game is quite the realistic procedure, and doing the most mundane of tasks generally involves fumbling at first and not really knowing what inputs are expected, but once you get in tune with the game you'll begin to figure it out instinctively based on your combined knowledge of the real world and the game's eccentric control scheme rather than relying on established videogame norms. Then the real summer can start.My Summer Car will make you responsible for your well-being, and provide real consquences for not obliging. You pee and drive a crap-sucking truck not because that's what all the cool Steam review guys did for laughs, but because if you don't, you won't have money to buy gas for grocery trips and your bladder will explode. And don't think it's that easy - I mean, peeing is obviously quite easy (don't forget to force it out when you start dripping), but to do pretty much anything else in this game you have to drive some type of vehicle several kilometers down some of the most treacherous roads in gaming history. Not that there's lava around or anything - they're just really narrow, and generally have a ditch on either side where if you get stuck, you're stuck for good. It's a bit cruel that not even AI will stop to help, but that's Scandinavian hospitality for you I guess. And if you do get to your destination, don't expect fanfares or an XP bar increase or anything of the sort - you just do your job, collect your money from the NPC, drive back home.If it's starting to look a lot like the game took a page out of DayZ's book with the whole ""do a bunch of mundane-yet-immersive stuff and get a slap across the face for reward,"" that's because it kinda did. But this game has ca- oh wait, DayZ also has cars, but this game has car building. I mean, good car building.Of all the overly complex and daunting-yet-strangely-fun-in-the-end parts of the game, the car building is perhaps the most of all those things. You walk out of your house, you see a garage, and in front of that garage an empty car frame. No suspension, no interior, no engine, no nothing. Then you open the garage and find all of those things, broken down into hundreds of different parts neatly showcased on the shelves, waiting for assembly. This is the point where you begin to regret your purchase, but don't refund just yet, it gets worse. Tens of hours later, full of Finnish swearing, sauna-sweating, firewood-chopping, engine-building, gas-stealing, tractor-driving, beer-drinking, road-raging, part-ordering, vehicle-rescuing and falling into septic tanks, you have your car in front of you, beautiful, shiny, just the color you painted it, with your custom parts on, all the bolts tightened, all the fluids poured in.It doesn't start.

								My Summer Car is an open world survival game? I suppose so but that doesn't explain it well... Finnish BarryBoy Simulator 1995 is a game that doesn't help you or hold your hand, it plops you into some backwater nordic town in the mid-90's, theres no tutorial or objective other than your motive bars (hunger, sleep etc.) but there's a garage attached to your house with all the parts for a Datsun 100A or Cherry (think 1970's Nissan Micra), a tiny little japanese car that you can build yourself piece by piece, tune, upgrade and even use to compete in rally's, nothing can quite describe the satisfaction you feel when you first get that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥s engine started. Obviously parts alone will not get the car started, you're gonna need oil, coolant, brake/clutch fluid and a new fan belt (and maybe some mods) and you're going to need the time to do it (motives ticking down) so you're going to need money. Theres a few ways in game to make money and you have access to 3 other vehicles that can be used to pick up this stuff and perform jobs, these 4 vehicles are essentially the game... Little blue van based on a version of the toyota HiAce? You can use this to pick up your drunk mates down the pub when they call you, you can use it to pick up stuff for the car or food and drink (and for all you alcoholics out there it can only store up to 100 crates of beer). It behaves quite realistically, the back end is boaty when its empty and the van is prone to tip more as it's top heavy and the engine takes a little bit to start when its cold and you need to let it warm up a bit before putting it in gear because it runs on diesel, yes diesel, IT RUNS ON DIESEL... just making sure you put the right one in when you get fuel because SOME people might have put petrol in there, tried to drive off and think the games bugging out when the engine explodes, not me though, I'm smart. *innocent whistle* Occasionally people will call up and asked to have their septic tanks drained for money, fortunately you have a septic truck which is based on a Finnish Sisu M-series (M-162) lorry/truck which has 3 axels, rear one can be lifted for more speed and better MPG at the expense of stability and the air brakes have realistic air pressure (things I didn't see in any of those truck simulator games) You can drive up to the peoples houses, put the pipe into their drain and suck away their crap, what you do with the waste after is totally up to you! My personal favorite is ""in a policeman's face at the speed traps"" The Sisu can also tow wrecked cars which can be sold for scrap.Theres also a tractor. When people call up asking for lumber you can go to the barn near your house, chop up some wood and fill the nearby trailer, you can then use the tractor to tow the wood filled trailor to the person's house in give them your wood (insert smutty inuendo here). The tractor can also be used to tow your car if you happen to break down (or crash somewhere and survive) and you can use it to tow wrecked cars stashed around the map but I recommend you use the Sisu lorry/truck for that.If you truly love cars this is the game for you, yeah theres no Ferrari's or anything flash but its the best car mechanic simulation game I've ever seen, the building and tunning is the closest I've seen to real life. Theres a few bugs but its a small developer and they do patch it (Last patch was xmas 2016 and they threw in a wrapped present containing a flashing neon light for your cars interior and a bottle of vodka). The graphics aren't great, the people look horrible for example but it doesn't effect gameplay. It is realistic and yet it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's full of charm, humour and love (and Finnish Easter eggs!) something that big budget titles lack these days. It just needs more everything! More cars, jobs, maybe a motorcycle? But it's definitely worth every penny of the £10.99 I paid for it. If you're okay with no map and hand holding this game is a real gem.			",61,5,1,17,9,0,1
