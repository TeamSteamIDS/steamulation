												8 minutes is all it took for me to hate this game. For the most part I try to keep myself from choosing if I like or dislike a game for around 2 or 3 hours. But this? No.To be honest, I wouldn't have even considered downloading this if it weren't for one of my favourite Youtubers being threatened by these ♥♥♥♥♥ucking ♥♥♥♥♥s because they think that ""It is now citing incorrect facts that can now be interpreted as defamatory."" What the hell?So I chose to try this game out. As I cannot even describe in full detail my experience as it was about as boring and broken as the game is, I will just give you the basic rundown.I start the game and practically instantly I am assaulted with generic rock music and a stretched menu. Oh boy this isn't going to be fun. I had to choose a monster truck which I did. A fire horse that I will now refer to as Rapidash just because I can. I go into the game and can't move. I assumed it was the arrow keys (which it was) but they wouldn't work. I figured out later that it was because there was a countdown and my only way to see that was if I looked to the very small countdown on the left. Not sure if that is my fault for not being observant, or the game's fault for tucking it away and making it so small.I moved forward at a slow pace and tried turning slightly left. That failed as now I hit a ramp that was in front of me sideways with half my car not even on the thing. I still hit some vans that were where I landed though. They definately didn't look like actual vans. they were more of cardboard set pieces that were hollowed out. After a while of flinging about thanks to sensitive turning being a thing, I chose to try an actual match against the bots. That was a disaster. I tried to beat them once and failed with the same problems I had when in practice mode which was launching into the crowd, ramping off in the wrong direction, flipping over because I turned to fast and so on. In the ranking board I saw that I needed 150,000+ points to win. Nope. Alt F4. Didn't even deserve a click on the quit button.Don't make me play this again.(PS: if you're curious about the threat I talked about at the beginning, here's the link

												Don't buy this game. Especially if you're a Linux user. The game has simply segfaulted for months on end, maybe even over a year by now, and do the devs care? No. Someone provided a workaround on the forum in the form of a zip file - if you want to trust random files from people on the internet, it works. But WTF? We really need random people to fix this broken mess? No. Also, the game itself - when I was last able to actually play it - simply sucked. That's not, as far as I know, platform-dependent. On top of that, the devs are now threatening legal against against YouTubers who refuse to take down videos showing just how terrible the game was before patches. Like, WHAT? Get your head checked. If you read all this and still buy the game, well, you brought this ♥♥♥♥♥icane on yourself.			",555,230,9,70,41,6,90

												The ""Destruction"" will most likely be of your patience since at launch it doesn't really support a controller and it thinks my mouse is a figment of my imagination. Basically I can't play it unless I'm just confiming the choices in the menu, I can't navigate with controller, keyboard, or mouse. I WAS able to drive around a track though... but I couldn't map my triggers for gas and brake. Sigh... I'm not trying to be snarky... just annoyed. Guess I'll have to wait for a patch. Not recommended at launch, hopefully they'll patch it.EDIT Post Patch: It's now playable but I'll leave this review as is for posterity for very rough launches.			",340,81,29,16,32,3,14

												Not a great game. It's glitchy and the computer drivers are terrible. The physics are not bad, but also aren't that good. It's missing all of the Monster Jam trucks. That all being said, depending on the price, it could be just what you need. I got it for $1, and at that price, it was just what I needed to scratch my monster truck game itch. I'm on the fence about recommending it. I guess I have to go with no, because it's just got too many flaws to recommend, but if you can get it for cheap enough, like I did, it's worth a play.

												Pros:- The new tracks are fun and replayable- A lot of new trucks were added, including mini trucks- Plays as smooth as the mobile versionCons:- REVERSE is completely unfunctional, no matter how you try to map it out on the controls- Controls are a mess- ""Full controller support""? I want to know what type of controller the devs used that actually worked for this game- At the start of a Race or Freestyle mode, Starting Lights do not show up the first time unless you 'restart' the event or quit. Even so, the Starting Lights do not show up even on the 2nd round of races- AI can become AFK- AI runs at half speed or none at all in some moments- AI pathfinding is abysmal - Music quickly becomes repetitive - Only 3-5 soundtracks are in the game- They released this before they even updated the Mobile version, which in fact comes out in SIX weeks- Too many bigfoot Monster Trucks, which narrows the variety- Sadly, the Mobile version of the game puts this in its place- No multiplayer (which is coming to the Mobile version I believe)So overall, this game is NOT worth for what it is currently priced at. i'd say it's worth... maybe nothing? Should be Free-To-Play considering it's almost unplayable. This is highly unprofessional on the condition it was released, due to the fact they have been working on this update for 2 years. I've supported these guys since its release on iOS and have been somewhat satisfied. Just stick to the Mobile version if you already have it or not. Do NOT buy this just yet. A huge disappointment.

STOP TRYING TO CENSOR CRITICISM OF YOUR GAME!It's perplexing that devs still try to pull this♥♥♥♥♥♥off.By the way, in the few minutes I played the game in order to be able to review it, it was already pretty clear that it is in fact garbage. Bad graphics, horrible sound, bad controls, ridiculous translation (defaulted to German for me), uninteresting gameplay. It's just not a good game. I would normally say, pick it up in a bundle or for a few cents, if you really need a monster truck game in your life. But since they behaved like this - please don't give them any money. Thanks.

												Don't let the graphics fool you, this isn't worth your time no matter how much you love monster trucks. - No controller support- Bizarre keyboard setup (Esc does nothing, Enter acts as you'd expect Esc, have to switch to mouse on menus, etc.)- ""Options > Controls"" should provide details of what the current controls are, and allow you to change them. In this game, the only thing present under that menu option is a sensitivity bar!?!- No real sense of control- When attempting to end a run, the game crashes- No difficulty setting- No indication of what you are supposed to do in a championship matchPlay pretty much anything else and you will have more fun.

												I got this game for free via a friend of mine and i honestly can say that this game is not really well executed.I think that the idea is pretty cool and all that, but the execution is pretty poor as far as i can see.Pros:1. Good performance. Steady 60 FPS and no noticable drops.Cons:1. It's an obvious mobile port. Mobile ports are mostly not good. This is a good example.2. The game is heavily farmable. You gain next to no money.3. There are no control settings (Apart from sensitivity... wait, what?) nor any tutorial.Verdict:Game has good performance with it's 60 FPS, but that's about the only positive thing. The game lacks a lot of basic features a PC port needs. In short, this game is not recommended.			",76,5,4,2,3,0,3

												This game has alot of major flaws that need to be fixed immediately. I have no control over what I am doing as in choosing different types of gameplay myself. The only keys that work in each section for me are:Main Menu: Esc. , Enter/SpaceIn Game: Arrowkeys/WASD (Going backwards does not work)When I try to select any options with my mouse, nothing happens. I mouse over what I want to do in the game and absolutely nothing happens. The only way to exit the game (in fullscreen) is to CTRL+ALT+DEL out of it. I just exit the program in windowed mode. I have nothing bad to say about the actual driving part besides it is a little too difficulty when you are force to buy one of the weaker trucks first, maybe if you guys tune the trucks that the computer runs down a little bit, it would be a lot more enjoyable for a younger audience that would get frustrated to quickly.I do really think this game has alot of potential. All it needed was a little more time put in to it before its release date. From what I have seen on the trailers of the game it looks great, and that's really what I wanted this game to be. I'm sorry to say it but I can not reccomend this game yet, but like I said before, a little tweaking to this game and it could shoot all the way to the top.P.S. I would also like to say that I have the mobile game for an Apple device, which I have nothing bad to say about. Not to criticize you about another one of your guys's programs, but I see alot of updates are being released for Android phones/tablets and it would be nice if you could release them for Apple devices. I have no idea if you guys have any plans for that, but it would be great.			",7,0,0,0,1,0,0

How is the Australian government involved with this? Wait. Where's the main menu? Did I skip it somehow? no. There's no main menu. oh.ok.Well, to revise a quote from known internet goblin, gnome, and gremlin, Keemstar,""Let's get right into the refuse"".Apparently, this game supports the organization Autism Speaks. That's great, I guess, but I don't think autism would want this game to speak for it. I mean, look at this game. It's absolute garbage.It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dark as well. 


YOU CALL THIS A MAIN MENU? WHAT ARE YOU, AN IMBECILE? AND WHY IS IT SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DARK? 
A Screenshot of Monster Truck Destruction
By: =[DSG]= Lan Can't Aim




I did not change the settings. This is how dark the game is by default.This is because they threw in EVERY VISUAL EFFECT EVER.Turning off the effects completely makes it look like this.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=719621786Now the Exit button doesn't work and I have to end the process manually through task manager. This is because once you change the graphics settings you have to restart, and the game DOES say it needs to restart to apply the changes to the settings. But it never does.Just so you know, that back button in the bottom left is completely useless. It goes back one car in the car selection. Which is exactly the same thing the arrow does. So why does it exist? I have a theory. I think the devs decided to go with quantity over quality. Think about it. 5 million sponsors. The buttons that are redundant. The plethora of unnecessary graphical effects. 43 ♥♥♥♥ING TRUCKS. 24 ♥♥♥♥ING TRACKS.The video settings are garbage at worst and unprofessional at best.Full is not a resolution.If you make PC games you should know what resolutions are.That's where the interesting bit comes in.Now, you may be thinking, ""Lan, you haven't talked about the gameplay"".The gameplay.The handling is garbage and would ruin the game if it wasn't already trash. This is probably to introduce artificial difficulty into the game.I mean, it's OK, (not worth buying, though) but that's not surprising, because it's A ♥♥♥♥ING MONSTER TRUCK GAME.YOU CRASH INTO♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRIFT, and you also wonder why the combo time is so short.I'll tell you why. Because this used to be (and still is) an android game. A free Android game.With In-App Purchases. Now since I don't have an Android, I can't tell you what they are. But, I CAN tell you the price range of said IAPs. $0.99 to $32.99. My guess is on the Android version, you buy the levels and ingame money with real money, since the combo time is so short, points are hard to get, and levels are difficult to beat. But, maybe, if you spend $30, you can get everything. But this is all just speculation, except for the bit about it being an Android game and the price range of the IAPs.This also explains the overall low quality of the game, the bad handling (most likely originally touch controls), and the interface in general. The levels are not ordered very well and can go from, in one level, the points necessary to win, 510000 to 215000. They've left in the Premium Purchase bit on some of the vehicles in the shop and the Unlock Level button on levels that haven't been reached yet. The devs don't care. They got your money for a minimal effort port of a mobile game. Another example of devs having the ""♥♥♥♥ you, got mine"" mindset.This is NOT a good game.Also, devs, Steam users will drop you, like, well, your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, if you attempt to censor criticism. Look at Day One: Garry's Incident. You aren't the first, and you certainly won't be the last. It's time to start damage control. Own up to your♥♥♥♥♥♥and issue an official public apology to ANYONE you threatened with legal action regarding their opinion on your game, maybe do a couple bug fixes, make a giveaway, I don't know. Just stop being idiots and act like the adults you are supposed to be, instead of petty children. TL;DRYou can't censor me, you can't sue me, I'm behind 7 proxies, and you'll do nothing but cry.

												This game is horribly bad. Stay away from it is all I can advise you to do.Oh, and yeah, the devs threatened to sue a YouTuber who reviewed their game in an honest video. So maybe you also want to stay away from every other game the devs will ever create. Just maybe.			",3188,1238,124,369,411,30,496

												This was an okay game at a cheap price, better than it's competition, I actually liked this game and gave it a mild recommendation and a positive video review, but unfortunately ODD Games decided to flush their reputation down the toilet by threatening a reviewer with legal action because he gave the game a negative review. Since that debacle, I have deleted my positive review and pulled that video from youtube. I can't support any dev that attempts to bully people into censorship. This could be the best game ever made and I'd still say don't buy it. What they did was unethical, and disgusting on many levels and it will likely cause their company far worse damage than that single negative review ever did. Devs, it's simple, really, if you can't take criticism, don't make art or consumer products. And instead of going after negative reviews with legal action (that you can't actually take because that isn't how the law works) how about you reach out to the people that actually liked your game and try to build a community? You know, be positive and grow organically, instead of being toxic and unethical. Just a thought.			",861,189,88,79,73,18,74

												I played for about 10 minutes before writing this. It's the only monster truck game in existence that I know of, so I have to give it points for that. That's about the only think I will give it credit for though. It is very poorly optimised. I was getting terrible framerates while my GPU usage was around 25% and CPU was around 50%. This is very old hardware but it was still pretty bad even for what I am using. Controls were okay with a Xbox controller. Options would be nice. Anyway, this game might be worth a dollar at the most. Don't buy it for full price. I got in a bundle. For a dollar it might be worth it if you're bored, like monster trucks and don't expect too much out of it.			",171,12,12,9,17,0,14

												//First update version review:ENG:At last a game developers fix the most important bugs & that was a gameplay & menu navigation. You can now a play the game with out any confused because you see what you do now. Still it's a lot of thinks what not was a right or need a fix.Fixed the pros thinks:- Navigation work now with a mouse. +++++- Game is a visual & effect was a good even if this a game was a mobile portable version. ++++- Soundtracks. +++- Fun & fine physics model & a gameplay in general & also Monster Truck a control. ++- Can a tuned Monster Trucks. +Thinks what a need more improve or fixed:- The game ""Start"": Monster Trucks start is allways perfect on startline when you push a gas down immediately. No factors EFFECT any loss or impressive there. ------ You can't roll/rotate Monster Truck car in tuned/shop view. ----- Damage modeling could be more sensitive and breakages would be need to fix the problem. ----  Some of the menus are still not working, for example, the training mode game esc button does not reacts menu. --- It would be more fun if the AI drivers should exercise that runs with the player. -If the game developers just keep the game development and improve things still in the game is able to be the best Monster Truck game on Steam. I recomented this a game now, because important bug is fixed. :3//Ensimmäisen päivityksen jälkeinen arvostelu:FIN:Vihdoin pelin kehittäjät ovat korjaneet pelin olennaisimmat bugit ja se on pelattavuus eli päämenujen navigointi. Voit nyt pelata peliä ilman turhaa hämmennystä koska voit hallita peliä. Silti pelissä riittää vielä parannettavaa, jotka tarvitsevat korjausta.Parannetut & positiiviset asiat:- Pelin menujen ja käyttöliittymän käyttö hiiren avulla. +++++- Peli näyttää visuaalisesti hyvältä kuten effectitkin vaikka peli olisikin mobiili peli käännös. ++++- Peli musiikki +++- Hauska ja hyvä fysiikka mallinnus sekä ajettavuus Monster Truck autoilla. ++- Pystyy tuunaamaan Monster Truck autoja. +Asioita jotka vielä tarvisivat parannusta tai korjausta:- Pelin ""startti lähdöt"". Monster Truck autolla saa aina täydellisen lähdön kun painaa kaasun heti alussa pohjaan. Ei ole mitään suuria vaikutuksia tai eroja tai mitään tekijöitä, jotka vaikuttaisivat tähän lähtöön. ------ Pelin tuunaus/kauppa valikossa et pysty pyörittämään Monster Truck autoa. ----- Vauriomallinnus voisi olla herkempi ja ehkä tarkempi ja jos autoon tulee ongelmia niin, se olisi korjattava. ---- Silti jotkut menu valikoista ei vielä toimi kuten harjoitus tilassa esc nappula ei reakoi menuun. --- Olisi hauskempaa jos harjoitus tilassa olisi muitakin Monster Truck autoja pelaajan kanssa. -Jos pelin kehittäjät vain jatkavat pelin kehitystä ja parantavat asioita edelleen peli kykenee olemaan paras Monster Truck peli Steamissa. Voin suositella peliä nyt, koska ovat korjanneet olennaisimman bugin pois ja peli on pelattava. :3			",452,105,67,38,78,8,80

												This is the greatest monster truck game there ever was ! Lots of trucks to buy, a good number of tracks and 3 main story mode tours to do.  The game is basic when it comes to graphics and gameplay but its alot of fun. There is no look back option but there are a few good camera angles to choose from. Interior view is pretty good. Handling wise you can adjust the sensitivity slider to your liking. It makes the game more enjoyable. The A.I is pretty good for the most part, although you can see them screw up a bit too. Sometime's they can waste you and others edge you out of a win. The game isn't graphically AAA+ but it really does have a good authentic monster truck feel for whats on display. Those who watch the sport will approach driving over vehicles and barriers much like they do in real life, with ease and then a lot throttle,,, the end result is satisfying. Nothing better than seeing the caving in of cars, vans, rvs and busses while driving over them.You pick a low level truck to start with and build it up by winning races and freestyle events. Earning in game credits to do so. The crowd is pretty responsive to whats going on in game on the track as well. Overall the game is pretty good. Watching gameplay video's via YouTube just doesn't do it justice. You have to feel it for yourself. For a $5 price tag ($2.80 on sale) It is worth the price. I give the game a8.5/10. Solid monster truck game Mr. Odd Games, solid monster truck game.			",9,2,3,0,2,0,0

												Have only played this game for a little bit. Yes the graphics are dated in comparison to other games. Other people have complained there is no controller support but my Xbox 360 controller works a treat! What I have played so far I have enjoyed.Moment I most enjoyed so far was rolling my Monster Truck. Lying on my side and fanging the  throttle. Monster Truck getting into a Whirlwind spin that got faster and faster until it finally flipped up and I was on my whells again. Kinda reminds me of this fighting movies where bad or good guy gets knocked down and they flip up onto there feet.The deforming bodies of the Monster Trucks and card you drive over seems pretty good.I cant see any reason to hate this product like so many other people. I see this type of game as a quick jump in, have a fang and then come back another day.			",641,142,53,63,83,10,106

												I found this game suprisingly addictive... I'm a big fan of hardcore racing sims and physics games, and this is a nice escape from the serious stuff, but still tightly put together in a fun little physics-based pocket of destruction. Awesome game! Wish it had more locations to tear up, but does still provide decent quality. Buy this, it's only 5$!			",33,8,27,2,4,0,0

												Once bugs were worked out around the controller issue's this games is AWESOME!!!   I play alot of different racing games and as far as Monster Truck racing and freestyle goes this one rocks.  The physics of this game are perfectly balanced.  I do think they could of taken alittle more time and detailed some of the tracks better.  The school bus's look like 8bit graphics and when damaging the vehicles the effects are really pretty cheap, but all in all I find myself coming back to this game more and more.  And for the fun this game offers its well worth the price.  I'm really hoping they will release DLC maybe more tracks, better damage models and more trucks.  I was disappointed to find out there was no ""Grave Digger"" included in the main lineup.			",143,7,34,9,27,0,24

												UPDATE: after a year on steam this game has Started to recieve hate and controversey and I see why now cause the game itself is decent but all of the game is just another mobile portI have also heard about the controversey between the developer and Nerdcubed and this has really put back my trust as a gamer and for these reasons i have given it a 5/10 it has some redeeming factors but with the current controversey it is a hit or miss.

												I just rebought and downloaded this game today, and I have to say that, with the exception of an extremely slow framerate issue when all of the graphics are turned all the way up, the game is 100% better over the state is was in at launch. The graphics are nice and crisp, even with the adjustements to handle the chugging, and it looks like something I expect to see on Steam or a console.The controller mapping is very intuitive, too. I really like the way mouse movements were integrated into the mapping, meaning that I don't have to put down the controller after a race. At the time that I'm writing this, I've done about 12 races, all on the Eastern Championship and I only ran into one time where I had to restart the race because the lights glitched out and I couldn't move. I'm so glad that you guys took our criticisms to heart and really put in the leg work to make this game every bit the experience we thought it could be. I can safely say that I'd recommend this game to anyone I know who's a fan of monster trucks or of this game in general. Even with the framerate issues. Which I hope, and I have no real doubts, will be fixed.			",9,2,0,1,0,0,2

												I'm very debated on this. Then again this is coming form a guy that hasn't played the android version so it's your call to take it. This game, from it's truck selection seems almost like some sort of annaversary to all the trucks that has entered, then again, it's missing quite a lot like gravedigger, madusa, and such. It feels good on controls (since it's just the arrow keys(or wasd) And when you find out where the checkpoints are, you can easily cut corners once you're frustrated enough.Yeah, it can get frustrating. Pretty much your truck, every truck, is a rubber toy where any bump turns into a ping pong mess. Trying to race and control your truck can become a draining task yet I personally want more. If they lightened the physics a tad bit then this would be fun hands down.Now the potential in this is great. if they turned this into an actual console/PC game I could see it mixed with Monster Jam: Path of Destruction (my fav so far)  To create your truck and add team races and accessable to 4 players. It has good potential, and I can see why poeple love it so much.I'll continue play this, but it's of asking yourself how much frustration can you stand. That or toss out you compeditive side and just goof off and hope you make progress.It's a shame they force us to vote on the game, because I don't think I can recommend, nor dislike the game from people, it's just, I want more to it.

												Had this game on my I-phone for a while, Always enjoyed it there, was a good time killer when such is needed. Saw it was now avalible on PC, so I decided to give a go, despite the negative review's, at 4.99 I figured it wouldn't be a big loss if it was atrocious. The PC version is...A little different and takes some getting used to. The control physics seem to be a little improved over the Mobile version of this game. The truck's don't roll over as easily as they do in the mobile version. This game can be frusturatingly challanging at times, due in part to the A.I. which flucuate's from being professional badass's who set record time's around the track (Almost unfairly it seems at times) to being complete moron's who couldn't navigate their way out of a wet paper bag. One of my favorite feature's of this game is the fact that they offer a few vintage trucks...Bigfoot #1 and the Original USA-1 trucks is pretty cool to see, since these beasts of the 1980's are the one's I grew up watching. The game has a few more features than it's mobile counterpart which is a plus.The rest of the game is fairly underwhelming, but what do you expect for a five dollar mobile port? The Graphics are sub-par by todays standards, the sound quality is monotonous, the soundtrack is simple...Offering very limited tracks, but in fairness they stay true to the nature of ''Monster Trucks''. So, to summerize, the controls are somewhat clunky, the sound is avarage, the graphic's are Playstation 2 Era quality. But if you love Monster Trucks, especially the 1980's Alumni, and you are willing to see past this games short comings and just enjoy it for what it is, you can't go wrong. Overall Score 6/10Graphics = 5Sound = 5Controls = 5Replayability = 7 ",82,7,3,3,3,0,5

												It's not going to win any awards, but given the low price and dearth of competition, worth picking up if you really, really want a monster truck game. And, unlike a lot of cheap mobile ports, the developers actually care about patching out the bugs.			",1603,732,61,207,160,18,229

												Just had some amazing good times with this game!!!! If you look at the dates of the previous reviews you will see that the developers have updated this game since the last bad reviews. I use Windows 8.1, had zero problems and tons of fun. Just want folks to know it works for me and it's AWESOME!! Big wheels...Bouncy suspension...Fun bodies...Destruction....Mayhem....Lots of race courses and trucks. The game was built just for me.			",109,32,46,2,20,6,3

												Yes! As of 27/7/2015 there is CONTROLLER SUPPORT! :D THANK YOU for adding that, developers!At last, it's properly playable on a PC and it's a fantastic game.The only downside has to be the menus - they're really scrappy and not really functioning well with the controller, but thankfully there's a mouse pointer for that. It would be lovely to see an update to tidy up the menus in the future.That said, the gameplay is top notch. At the price it's on here for, you won't get better monster truck physics anywhere else.. it's tough as nails but great fun too, with lots of content to keep you busy :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With the new patch. The game works pretty darn well. I loved it on the iphone and android. I love it even more now that it is on the PC. For a $4 game and the controls patch. well worth the money for any Monster Truck fan. The best MT game since Monster Truck Madness 2. Now if we can get a track and truck editor or at the very least a track editor. :)I think people were a little quick to through stones at the game. Its not like it was a AAA title at $60.

												Fun and cheap monster truck game with lots of truck choices, three championship modes and multiplayer.  You also can buy upgrades for your trucks.  Now there is controller support and I've had no glitches so far.  This is a mobile port I believe so dont expect too much from the graphics.  As stated already the ai sometimes can be flawless and hard to beat but other times you are sitting at the finish line waiting on them to finish.Overall my two year old and I has enjoyed playing Monster Truck Destruction.  If you are wanting a Monster Truck game there may be better ones out there (I dont know) but if you can get this for a cheap price I say give it a shot!			",70,11,4,10,3,0,3

												While the controls were slightly wonky, since I could not find the reverse key, it made it hard in some freestyle situations. all in all, however, the game plays very smooth and is overall a great game! My playstation 3 wired controller worked great with the game, so I had good controller support! Two things need fixed so far: reverse control and the texture for Bigfoot 5 when the shell takes roll damage. At least on mine, the mesh jacks up when you roll it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Man this is great memories from childhood here. All they are missing is Grave Digger and Master of Disaster and it would be complete. Actually pretty decent physics engine here, I'm not 100% about it being true to life, but it's consistant. A ton of fun though! Difficulty is at a good level I think, with going fast scoring more but going out of control will lose you races. I might be a bit biased here with nostalgia, but I haven't seen a better one on Steam.  Worth every penny imo. 8/10			",2005,631,82,246,196,18,265
