												This game has its Pros and Cons however its decent but not as good as Ford Racing 3Pros:1. Team RacingIt is a good feature towards the game to switch to different cars while in gameplay and get the team up to enough points to win the race2. The GraphicsThe graphics are ok for the game at its time so dont try to judge it by that3. Comfortable ControlsYou can't change the controls so they better be good which they are.Cons:1. Lack of carsThere are only 18 cars in the game and 6 in 3 different classes however if you get the XR Edition (Which is the better verison of this game) you get 22 cars. However the XR Edition is the not available for PC2. Display OptionsNONE, literally no display options in this game. Which surprise me because Ford Racing 3 has a better display option than this game which is made by the same company and this game came out a year after Ford Racing 3. So you have to play in this medium size screen.3.Repetitive GameplayIt literally gets boring after two hours of playing this game. It only says I played 0.7 hours but I had the ps2 verison of this game and beaten the game. You beat the game and there nothing for you to do but just race the cars.4. Annoying MusicThe Music is not that good in this game. Ford racing 3 had a better soundtrackThis is pretty much a downgraded verison of Ford Racing 3. However, its only 5$ so i say give it a try. Ford Racing 3 is more recommended though. Have Fun! ",22,4,3,2,6,0,2

												For the first time, this is a game I won't recommend. Why? Very simple: even though this game is more recent than Ford Racing 3, I will straight up tell you right now that Ford Racing 3 is a lot more fun and will give you a lot more great times than this game ever will. If you already have FR3 and you're a Ford enthusiast (just like me), then step right up! If not, then you'll regret the 99 cents you'll spend...Pros:- Cars are quite beautiful and well designed- City races give you that ""street racing"" feel (but not nearly as much as, say, any Need For Speed game)- The whole ""swapping cars"" mid-game is actually kinda niceCons:- Game gets repetitive (unlike in FR3)- There aren't nearly as many racing types as in FR3- Doesn't have as many cars as FR3 has- Doesn't have as many races as FR3 has- Campaign isn't as fun as FR3's campaign- The whole Team Racing features don't make up for this game's price valueOverall, I'll give it a 5/10. But honestly? Get Ford Racing 3, it's much more fun (something I made quite explicit in this analysis, I know)			",659,170,50,100,85,15,101

												I was really disappointed with the  Street environments in this game.   Flatout two has   Street racing included as well as   a lot more, plus the graphics,  the modes of play and the destructible environments knock spots of this mediocre game.  I couldn't play it for more than 15 minutes or so  as it  also made me feel  sick and  the backs of my eyes  ached.   In this game you have to play and win various solo levels to  unlock new tracks, new vehicles, new race types  for example  time trials and elemimination rounds.      Car damage was evident after crashing a few times, but  it didn't detract from the  game play and there didn't appear to be any consequences  for damaging your vehicle.As with the other two Ford games, I was  very disappointed in this game.   The  same poor graphics  especially compared to other games released around the same time and the poor vehicle handling.  Drifting was almost impossible, which led me to crash around  some of the  steeper corners (unless i slowed down significantly; at which time, I'd be over taken by every car in the race, even if I was first at the corner.  I really can't recommend  this or any of the other  Ford games.  I do hope they don't release the  earlier releases (Ford Racing and Ford Racing 2) on Steam later. ",4945,1930,224,565,875,79,758

												I like it very much if you like playing a retro game and using a retro style arcade like game and  not having any concequences from damaging your vehicle and your a petrolghead or a guy/girl that likes cars made by ford i recommend it. It reminds me of when i was working at the amusement arcades , Ford world racing was one of our arcade machines i enjoyed it when i had the occassional free time after work to play it im happy that i got this game sometimes even theolf 2000 ish games sometimes are really good thanks for putting this on steam it brings back memories many memories.i give it a 8/10 because It only plays in 640x480 so be prepared to adjust your screens back after playing this game and very amusement arcade machine style.And not much customization or anything. But renember back in the day this was quite a desirable game i liked it alot when i was a kid never found it on the shelves of stores in the uk.Good side: 1.You get to play with ford cars in an illegal street racing scene.2.changing colours of the ford cars which is all legit3.Graphics are pretty ok for an old game4. Arcade Rage Racer physics5.Fords of all shapes and sizes up to 2009 ishBad side:1. Lack of customization options2. No realistic physics at all it is a arcade game after all that used to be at the amusement arcades3.Ai can be alot faster then you at some points these cars are usually at the front which i call ""hulks"" of cars meaning they are a very finely tuned ai that can be a bit too good but you can beat them with a little bit of cheating cutting corners and some agressive driving can take em out or just outsmart them by using your racing experience or copying the ai by driving behind them a few laps.

												I was looking for this game and I'm glad it's on Steam. I've played it before and thought it was cool then, and you know what?... It's still cool today.It's challenging to unlock the cars, circuits, and special challenges. Most of my favorite Fords are in this game.The graphics are not super, but it's plenty good considering the age of the game. It does include making burnout and skid marks on the pavement and ruts across grassy areas, so it's got a thumbs up from me on that. There is also a little particle effect going on during vehicle collisions, and some sparking effects as you rub against other metal surfaces on the other vehicles. So, it's not too skimpy on the graphics since that is there (minimal, but still there).I love the sound effects. They have that certain muscle car sound you don't normally hear in other games, especially the Classics. It's a rugged gas guzzling rumble with clear sharp tuned hums and explosions as you hit the gas. Any racing game that does that is okay in my book.The hard-coded physics in the game are not as accurate as the new stuff, but it's pretty close. At least you get the basics of squatting rear ends, hill cresting, leaning, weight shifting in the turns, and proper redirection when colliding with other vehicles. You still get the feeling you are driving a heavy piece of metal in the smoothest way possible, and that's what really counts. - Also, the tires do behave like they are actually rolling on something. You can pick up on this by paying attention to sidewalks when you roll across them to cut corners, and the car will bounce and drop like you would expect it to do. So a plus on that too.The game doesn't focus a whole lot on damage, but the appearance of damage is there. Broken lights, paint scratches and flaking, twisted and crumpled metal, extra smoke, and just your basic appearances you might assume to see. Actual physcial damage does not occur, but that's ok because this game is about travel accuracy, not demolition accuracy. If you want demolition, then buy a demolition game.Collision detection with the other vehicles seems to be okay to me, but they didn't put much effort into colliding with track objects. Like you can hit a newspaper dispenser and fling it into the street, or across the street, but if you hit a pole then you'll just get the sound effect and pass straight through the pole as a ghost. You'll still slow down and have to fight to make up for lost seconds though, so it's not like you'll want to hit any of the poles much anyway.Normally I'm just a solo racer, but Ford Street Racing also implements Team Racing with 2 or more vehicles. Team controls are easy to use. I like being able to switch cars during a race. I also like being able to give team commands for blocking and drafting. If you do it right, then you can pretty much play hopscotch and walk all your team vehicles to the front on the first lap. Easier said than done sometimes in the Expert difficulty, but it can be done with practice.FSR does have some multiplayer features, but I'm not into multiplayer games, so I haven't tried them and I have nothing to say about that.The game is good enough to recommend and it's worth at least $5 (my honest opinion).NOTE: Steam did not include a link to the game's configuration manager. You have to do that yourself manually. To make resolution / graphic / sound / control setting changes, naviage to ...""C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Ford Street Racing\CONFIG""...or wherever you have your steam apps installed on your PC... and use the ""syscfg.exe"" application to make adjustments before starting the game. You'll find everything you need right there to make it look better, sound better, and control better.			",8,2,4,0,8,0,8

												Bought purely for the nostalgic value. I can't say my time was wasted entirely.Pros:Decent graphics for the generation and time it came out onThe driving seems to work fineCons: Small collection of carsBoring mapsLimited amount of things to actually DO in the game. It lacks any real campaignOverall I guess if you have money left over and you catch this game on sale for like a buck, you could buy it, otherwise there are plenty of better alternatives.
